            "content": "BEE-PROUD \nReview\nA historical comedy-drama film Pride is a 2014 British LGBT-related film written by Stephen Beresford and directed by Matthew Warchus. It is the perfect film for those who want to watch a educative but also a super fun movie. The film was released on 23 May 2014 in Cannes film Festival and on 12 September 2014 in the United Kingdom.   \nI did admire the film so much because the film is political and tells a true story about gays and lesbians that support the miners. I can understand why this very beautiful story was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy and for the BAFTA for Best British Film, Best Actress in a Supporting Role for Imelda Staunton ( she was in the film a member of the strike committee), and for outstanding debut by a British writer, director or producer.\nPeople who know about the British mine strikes will see that there is more than just a strike. The film \"Pride\" is about a shy gay boy who hasn't yet come out of the closet for his parents. He goes to London to study but meanwhile he also goes to the gay prides. The boy sees a group of lesbian and gays and joins them. This group is planning to start a campaign titled \"gays and lesbians support the miners\". With this campaign they want to collect money for the miners who are victim of stagflation and they have become poor as a consequence that they don't have a lot at home to eat. They wanted to donate the money that they have collected to a trade union. They often were rejected because they were gay but there was one union that did accept them but the citizens of the village didn't accept them. There will be a discussion between the two groups and after a blessing in disguise it is beautiful how it creates a bond between them.\nWhen I watched the movie with my friends I didn't know what the movie was about. I thought that it was a movie made for LGBTQ but it was more than that. It wasn't a movie for them only, it is also a movie you can watch with friends or with your class, you can even watch it with your family at home. This film can change your way of looking at gays, not in a sexual way, but in a way that makes you realize what they have to deal with.\nThe movie is political because it is about workers who stand up for their rights and are protesting on the streets. The film was excellent, it showed discrimination and how the prejudiced group learns that they made a mistake by judging. I also found it sad  for the boy whose parents didn't accept him because he was gay. I was watching the film worriedly about this boy, I wanted to know what was going to happen with him. All the ingredients of a feel-good film are present. The combination of moving elements, humour and personal development is reminiscent of films such as \u2018Billy Eliott' or \u2018The Full Monty', a list to which this film can certainly be added.\nPride is one of those rare films with content, entertainment and soul. It is also very funny but has also his sad parts. Some parts of the movie can really give you goosebumps or even a tear.I really did enjoy the film \u2018Pride'. We need more beautiful and learning stories like this one based on true stories with a successful cast like this one. The film was so powerful I held back from crying but couldn't resist the bittersweet tears of joy that were coming.",

A top-notch cast takes us on an odyssey across a country stricken by political upheaval and social unrest. I loved the parallels it made between miners fighting for their rights and the LGBT community fighting just to be accepted by a group they're trying to help but who offer nothing but insults and hostilities in return. Far from being a sombre, depressing affair, the movie is very uplifting and life-affirming, filled with slick humour and realistic characters. I felt that the Miner's town's acceptance of their new allies happened oddly fast for some members, and the lead character's abandoning of the group only to come back later is a very hackneyed plot twist, so much so that it's not even a twist anymore. But these little niggles did not hamper my enjoyment of the movie as a whole. The screenplay is witty and profound, the acting is excellent, its full of great character development and little subplots which all demonstrate how much of an impact the event had on those involved, its tender moments are never overdone and the tone is never oversentimental. It will bring even the stoniest of cinemagoers tears, and I say that anyone who has ever experienced even a sliver of discrimination should put this film at the top of their 'to-see' list.",

This is most definitely a feel good movie and there is little illustration of the hardships faced by the miners who were on strike for so many months. However the movie has tremendous good heart and is told in a warm and humorous manner, with some genuine belly laughs along the way. There's a terrific ensemble cast headed by Imelda Staunton and Bill Nighy who play the leaders of the village.

            "content": "cinegeek.de Pride sch\u00fcttelt es einfach so aus dem \u00c4rmel, das Verlangen des Publikums, aufzustehen und zu applaudieren! Hier kommt eine wahre Geschichte, die schlechterdings auch als Drama funktioniert h\u00e4tte, aber die Macher entschiedenen sich f\u00fcr eine leichtere Variante - die unsere Herzen \u00f6ffnet! Es ist genau diese Art von Publikums-Filmen, wie sie die Briten (Verzeihung, in diesem Fall die Waliser) am besten machen! Voller Mut, freundliche T\u00f6ne mit der dunklen Realit\u00e4t zu verbinden! W\u00e4hrend der Streiks der Bergarbeiter in Wales 1984, naht unverhoffte Unterst\u00fctzung: Die Londoner Schwulenbewegung, angef\u00fchrt von Mark Ashton (Ben Schnetzer), will ein Zeichen setzen der Solidarit\u00e4t. Geld wird gesammelt vor dem Buchladen \"Gay is the Word\". Einige Passanten spenden, andere spucken auf sie. Mark ermuntert die Freunde, trotzdem durchzuhalten, denn die einzigen Menschen in Grossbritannien, die von der Tagespresse noch schlechter behandelt werden als die Homosexuellen, das sind die Minenarbeiter. \"If anybody knows what this treatment feels like,\" so Mark, \"it's us.\" S\u00e4mtliche Geldmittel f\u00fcr die Minen wurden staatlich beschlagnahmt, Spenden zu sammeln f\u00fcr die Streikenden war damit ein Ding der Unm\u00f6glichkeit (man muss sich das vorstellen, wie viel Hass Thatchers Politik bis heute provoziert hat!). Durch diese Umst\u00e4nde und ein Missverst\u00e4ndnis (Die Bergarbeiter \u00fcbersetzten das \"L\" der LGSM f\u00e4lschlicherweise f\u00fcr \"London\") trafen sich beide Gruppen, die Schwulen mit den Minenarbeitern, im S\u00fcden von Wales. Mark wird begleitet von Joe (George MacKay), der noch bei seinen Eltern lebt, sowie dem Paar Jonathan (Dominic West) und Gethin (Andrew Scott). Joe ist f\u00fcr uns der nahestehendste Charakter; ein sch\u00fcchterner Junge, den Mark w\u00e4hrend der Schwulen-Parade 1984 kennen lernte. Die Bergarbeiter-Stadt wird vor allem repr\u00e4sentiert durch Hefina (Imelda Staunton) und Cliff (Bill Nighy), die beide dem Plot noch entscheidende Wendungen geben werden... Matthew Warchus hat das Ganze fast wie ein Musical inszeniert, so als ob es im Theater vor vollem Haus aufgef\u00fchrt werden soll. Gern benutzt er Klischees, doch das stellt nicht zwangsl\u00e4ufig eine S\u00fcnde dar, sofern man sie nur richtig einsetzt. Vieles ist voraussehbar (einer der Waliser wird sich sp\u00e4ter selbst noch outen, andere blockieren dumpf) - aber es ist schliesslich tats\u00e4chlich so geschehen! Innerhalb dieser Bausteine aber, findet Pride einen eigenen Weg, uns zu \u00fcberraschen und bewegen. Manches geschieht auf viel leiserem Weg, als wir es uns vorgestellt h\u00e4tten und niemals wird das Zeitgeschehen ausgeblendet: Die Aids Paranoia der 80er, die Gefahr, \"out & proud\" zu sein als Schwuler. Wir sp\u00fcren die Angst, die Gesellschaft k\u00f6nnte die Homosexuellen abweisen, genauso wie die Tatsache, dass sie aus der Familie verstossen werden, einfach aufgrund ihrer Identit\u00e4t! Genau das geschieht mit Joe. Mark \u00fcberreicht ihm einen Buttom: \"I am (discreetly) gay,\" - fortan wird Joe gegen\u00fcber seiner Familie behaupten, er nehme Teil an einem Kochkurs. Der Titel \"Pride\" kann so einiges f\u00fcr die Charaktere im Film bedeuten. Einige sind stolz auf das, was sie errungen haben, andere einfach auf das, was sie sind. Jeder Schauspieler darf sein eigenes Motiv \u00fcber dieses Thema spielen. Jeder steuert etwas bei zum Film, der grossen Spass macht und f\u00fcr mich einige sehr emotionale Szenen bietet wie den Aufmarsch der Londoner Gay Pride Parade 1985 (das grosse Finale). Und die Botschaft? Jemanden zu treffen, der anders ist, wirkt viel ehrlicher, informativer und bereichernder als es eine TV Sendung je leisten k\u00f6nnte. Nur so kann es gelingen, zwischen uns selbst und der Welt zu trennen: Wir sind nicht so unterschiedlich, wie wir denken und wir ben\u00f6tigen alle irgendwann einmal Hilfe. Wirkt das wie eine stereotypische Botschaft? Ich w\u00fcrde sie dennoch so lange wiederholen, bis sie auch der Letzte begriffen hat! dazu gibts die f\u00fcr uns bewegendsten britischen Publikumsfilme in unserer Film List auf cinegeek.de",

It was a story that I had not heard of before. Director Matthew Warchus' was sure to bring some inspirational elements of the film on how two opposite polar groups can work together for civil rights and fair labor. But Warchus' was sure to implore us with the aforementioned concept a few too times to many; as worthy as the concept is. I am a big fan of 80's New Wave Retro music, so I was very proud of \"Pride\" to include some U.K. New Wave classics. The ensemble acting was commendable but not sensational; which included Ben Schnetzner as U.K. gay activist leader Mark, Dominic West as the flamboyant Jonathan, and Imelda Stanton as a Miner Committee Member. \"Pride\" is not the biggest pride film piece from the 2014 movie year, but it has enough activist gravitas to give it a shout.",

Tensions flared between an unsympathetic government lead by PM Maggie Thatcher and the National Union of Mineworkers on a long contentious strike.\n\nAt the annual Gay pride march in London, a group of passionate activists decide to show their solidarity for the miners plight by raising money and banding together to form the LGSM (Lesbian and Gay Support Miners).\n\nThe only issue, the unions are embarrassed to receive 'their' support. Unperturbed by initial rebuttals, the LGSM randomly selected the small rural Welsh mining town of Dulais and descend to show their staunch support, handover the money raised and break down conservative prejudicial barriers.\n\nTV actor Stephen Beresford's terrific screenplay is not yet another sorry tale of victimhood, but one of civil rights. His utterly compelling story is full of heart and conviction as well as tangible sense of the era allowing viewers to truly grasp the hopeless situation that was the 1984/5 strike.\n\nThe tapestry of emotions felt by those involved is wonderfully showcased through an outstanding to-many-to-mention cast whose comedic timing is only surpassed by their dramatic acumen, this really is a case where only the trademark British wit and restraint could pull of such an enjoyable cinematic experience.  \n\nThe verdict: A deserved crowd-pleaser down to its rousing finale.\n\nPublished : Canberra Weekly Magazine\nDate of Publication : 14/11/2015",

Despite the pinkwashing and sanitizing, it was a thoroughly enjoyable movie that everyone should watch.

            "content": "Review:\nI quite enjoyed this touching true story about a group of gay and lesbian activists who come together to raise money for the families of miners during the miners strike in London, when Margaret Thatcher was in power. As the movie was based around the 80's, there was a lot of prejudice against the gay and lesbian community but this movie shows how this group came together and fought against all odds, to raise the money for the Welsh people who were going through such a difficult time. The group also protested for Gay and Lesbian rights, at a time when Aids was the biggest fear for there community, so this movie is a big eye opener to a world which is the norm in today's day to day life. The storyline is great, along with the performances and the witty script which brought some light to a situation were a lot of people were struggling to come to terms with there sexuality. The real footage on the DVD was touching because a lot of the activists were actually in the movie and they get to tell there story of how it was to deal with the true situation. Anyway, it's a well made movie which tells a true story which hasn't been told before so it's definitely worth a watch. Enjoyable!\n\nRound-Up:\nI've always been a fan of Bill Nighy's unique style of acting so I was glad to see him in this film, even though his role wasn't that big. The same goes for Dominic West who also had a small but important role in the film. Most of the rest of the cast have only had small roles in films so I can't really comment on there performances. Paddy Considine has starred in a few movies like the Bourne Ultimatum, Cinderella Man and Hot Fuzz but he's never played the main role. In this movie he played the go between the activists and the miners quite well but it was Dominic West's dancing which really impressed me. The other thing that impressed me was how a small group of people, who had weekly meetings, could have made such a big impact for there community. The amount of people that joined them in the end was touching and I'm glad that they changed a few laws after putting in such a big effort.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nBudget: N/A\nWorldwide Gross: $14.7million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their powerful dramas about a group of gay and lesbian activists who come together to support the miners strike at a time when there sexuality wasn't that welcomed by many people. 6/10",

Then there are some films that deserve the hype and publicity that only ever get minimal, usually these films belong to a film festival and it's only through word of mouth that they make it to their intended audience. Pride is a film that was first released at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival winning a standing ovation and the Queer Palm award from there it went onto a limited release schedule mostly being involved in Queer Film Festivals around the world.\nPride is a true life story based around the British Miner's Strike in 1984, Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister and not very popular, not with miners and especially not with the gay and lesbian community either. Joe, a young na\u00efve closeted gay boy arrives in London to take part in his first gay pride march, soon after arriving Joe is taken in by a local gay and lesbian rights activist group who do their part to raise funds to fight their foe Thatcher and her evil ways. Soon after the group realise that both the Miner's and the gay community have a lot in common they make the decision to start raising funds for the families of the miners in a little Welsh town called Onllwyn. The miners reject the gay and lesbian activists money believing it will do more harm than good for their cause so the group unfazed but a little perplexed decide to take the money personally to the town to hand it over and explain their situation and hopefully form a new alliance against the countries Prime Minister and her party...\nPride is set in a very bleak and dark time of British history but I feel that it's never actually shown that way, sure things are dark and gray but I wish the director just added more hardship to his final edit for the film, not being a part of it personally but remembering how harsh it was from school study and other films I have seen over time. I don't think the film was shown as brutally honest as it should have been, from what I know of those days; they were horrid, times were rough and extremely hard, I just wish that it was portrayed a little more than what we were given. That is my only concern with the film, which says a lot I feel. None-the-less it is a fantastic well made, well directed and full of amazing actors that really bring the story to life, the story is really well scripted and the actors chosen in their respective roles have done an amazing job. Staring Bill Nighy (Love Actually, Shaun of the Dead) as Cliff, Imelda Staunton (Maleficent, Vera Drake) as Hefina Headon, Dominic West (John Carter, The Awakening) as Jonathan Blake, Paddy Considine (Hot Fuzz, The World's End) as Dai Donovan, George MacKay (How I live Now, Peter Pan) as Joe \"Bromley\" Cooper who is one of the few fictional characters created for the film and a whole heap of others, it is actually a very great cast everyone did their part to make the film work. As I said earlier the cinematography of the film was good I just wish it was darker like the times it is set in. The director and his crew have done a great job with this film written by Stephen Beresford and directed by Matthew Warchus (Simpatico).\nPride is a feel good film with a fantastic story that can be shared with all your loved ones, there are a couple of scenes that may be a deemed a little over the top but perhaps you can use that to answer some curious minds if questions are asked. Pride is an amazing story that brings two very different worlds together for one great cause.",

            "content": "It's disconcerting when the news of your childhood becomes the historical movies of your adulthood. Pride did nothing if not confirm for me that I have officially hit middle-age. \n\nIt's a British comedic-drama about events during the Miners Strike in the UK of 1984 (I was 11, just about aware of what was going on in the wider-world). It focuses on two small communities: one is a small mining town in Wales of the sort that suffered most during that time. The other is a London-based group of gay and lesbian people who form LGSM (Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners). They take on the small Welsh community as a project for which to fundraise. The film is that story, of unlikely friendships and culture-clashes. In tone it is closes to British comedies like The Full Monty or Brassed Off; an edge of social realism and a triumph of underdogs storyline. \n\nThere's some fine performances - Bill Nighy is at his understated best, drawing laughs at times without uttering a word; the comedic tone sits well with some serious themes of social distress and prejudice and it's hard not to leave the cinema without at least a small air-punch of satisfaction at the film's feel good narrative arc. \n\nIt's not without flaws though. Some things just seem a little too easy to be true; did they really, for instance, break into singing that easily in the minibus? At times the adventures of the London-based characters come off too much like a school outing rather than engaging with one of the biggest social issues of the day. More seriously is an overly romantic view of history. The miners' strike was a brutal and painful period of British history for all sorts of reasons, not least because it fractured families and communities. The film presents to us a picture of communities and towns united in their stand; I can't speak for the individual town in question, but the brutal reality of the strike is that it was opposed from within the community of miners as well as by the government. Members of families fell into bitter, lifelong dispute; strike-breakers were, and maybe still are, 'scabs'. All this because some felt they and their families couldn't pay the price of their families' well-being. It's tempting to, as the film does, to play the strike as a unified struggle; but it wasn't and it does a grave injustice to the complexity of real people in unimaginably difficult situations to pretend otherwise. \n\nNone of this detracts from the joy of the film; it should also be noted, though, that the nature of the film means that the humour is broader than The Full Monty (it really is); and sometimes that too (especially towards the end) seems a bit too easy to be true. The film also suffers slightly from Return Of The King-itis in that seems to have about three endings. By the time the last one rolled around I was ready for the film to actually end.\n\nIt doesn't outstay its welcome, though. The reservations are real, but not major problems.",

An unlikely true story of an unlikely alliance that's unlikely well done, Pride tells the plight of both striking Welsh miners and the hugely persecuted English homosexual community in equal and genuine measure. A heat-seeking crowd-pleaser, the film comes damn close to becoming mawkish without actually tipping over the edge. The climax, for example, assumes a tone that almost feels a bit too cheeky.almost. Regardless, the dynamite performances and rich storytelling always come across as truthful throughout this production, however manufactured it feels. You've hear of designer drugs, eh? Here is a designer feel-good flick and it likewise plays with your body's chemical makeup to make you feel good.\n\nIn this R-rated dramedy available on DVD and download, U.K. gay activists work to help miners during their lengthy strike of the National Union of Mineworkers in the summer of 1984. \n\nBoasting a theater CV that includes Ghost: The Musical, Matthew Warchus deftly directs the goings-on with a nimble footed swagger, literally making your toes tap. For a non-musical, this is an impressive feat. For Pride, however, it also proves appropriate. Bill Nighy, Imelda Staunton, Dominic West, Paddy Considine, and Andrew Scott (the wicked wicked Moriarity to Benedict Cumberbatch's wily Sherlock on the BBC) play beaten-down and sometimes tragic figures, but they bring a resolve and vigor to their characters that you never feel sorry for them--just, well, proud. Their performances and the direction get you on your feet in solidarity, yes, but a good deal of credit also goes to the screenwriter. Stephen Beresford's script effortlessly hopscotches from bleak to hilarious moments and back again in a manner that somehow remains reverential to both.\n\nBottom line: Heart O' Miner",

Pride isn't a musical, but it surely feels like one with all the colorful characters and the lovable 80's soundtrack. It was a surprisingly fun film with an upbeat message about solidarity. It is one of those rare crowd-pleasers that stands out from other films thanks to its strong cast and uplifting message. I never imagined a film focusing on the historic events that took place in the UK in 1984 when the miners were at strike and found an uncommon ally in the gay and lesbian activists could be so fun. We've had similar plots in the past where two groups come together in the aid of each other despite their differences, but I don't think it has been done in such a contagiously joyful manner. Take last year's Dallas Buyers Club for example where we get a contrasting alliance between a redneck cowboy and a group of gays suffering from AIDS. That was a much more serious film where we got some comedic moments due to the contrasting lifestyles, but Pride takes this similar premise of contrasting groups coming together and delivers a much more hilarious and uplifting film. It still delivers the message and despite being formulaic it manages to stand out thanks to its colorful characters that never lose their humanity. I can't think of another film where a group of gay and lesbian activists aren't just fighting for their own cause, but are actually invested in helping others who are going through a difficult moment. So it stands out in that it isn't one of those films that is focused entirely on delivering a message in favor of gay rights, but rather focusing on the solidarity between these two groups.

There are also some dramatic moments where I literally got goose bumps because I was moved. It is well balanced and uplifting despite its flaws.\n\nSome of my favorite moments in the film involved the clashing of these two contrasting groups. Despite their differences they learn to understand each other because they both have suffered from oppression. The cast couldn't have been better. Ben Schnetzer gives an impressive performance as the gay activist who comes up with the idea of supporting this group and winning a new ally in the process, but the fun really kicks in when they interact with these miners from a small Welch community. This is where we are introduced to some great characters played by Paddy Considine, Jessica Gunning, Imelda Staunton, and Bill Nighy who are outstanding. Nighy really delivers by underplaying his character and proves that sometimes less is more. I enjoyed Gunning's strong female performance and I look forward to seeing her in more films in the future. George MacKay also delivers as this young kid who hasn't told his parents he's come out (which is probably the most formulaic part of this film) so he lies to them about his activities. Andrew Scott and Dominic West also have some endearing moments on screen together. The best thing about Pride is without a doubt the strong cast which thanks to the rich screenplay by Stephen Beresford are given such colorful and interesting characters.

            "content": "Britain, 1984. Margaret Thatcher's Tory government is facing the consequences of its extreme economic policies as employment, health and sense of freedom of the Average Joe is crumbling during a period of apparent economic boom. The miner's strike has been going on for weeks, resulting in illegal government action and measures against freedom of speech. 20 coal mines are under threat, spelling 20 hopeless towns. Union funds have been seized by the government, leaving the towns literally starving. Politics are polarizing. At the same time, gay rights are targeted by the same government, adding insult to injury to a community struggling with the peak of the AIDS epidemic.\n\nDuring the aggressively political London Gay Pride march a young man named Mark Ashton realizes something: the miners and the LGBT crowd have a common, dangerous enemy: their own government. A posse of a handful of London-based gays and one lesbian form a fundraising group called- informatively- Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners and start collecting money for food, setting up their base of operations in an artsy bookshop.\n\nThe at first glance unlikely support group manages to gain momentum and soon starts co-operating with the small Welsh mining town of Onllwyn. The core group of activists is soon invited to visit a town made up of beer drinking macho miners and their dutiful housewives. Things are about to change. The oddest of bedfellows, united only in the oppression that has embittered them, are about to meet. This is how you lay the grounds for a predictable but endearing, damn stylish and skilfully presented film based on actual events.\n\nThe main point of view in this tale of a meeting between two completely different worlds is that of Joe, a closeted, 20-year old boy who has just discovered the gay community. He documents the political struggle, both in London and in Wales, in photographs. His journey of self-discovery is as formulaic as the rest of the film, but also equally genuine, touching and well presented. He is the least aggressive in the group of young activists, allowing him a certain status of an outsider observing the uneasy union that is forming between initially homophobic miners and provocative young gay activists. The process is handled with insight here, the pacing perfect, the character interaction plausible and nicely complicated despite the both historically and dramatically obvious direction it's all heading into.\n\n\"Pride\" threads in very familiar territory, all in all. This along with some scenes that take emotion into the realm of sentimentality cripples the film in some obvious ways. But then again- \"Pride\" is exactly what it aspires to be. And it's still special and frankly just damn enjoyable as well as thought-provoking to watch, filled with rich characterization backed up by an army of wonderful performances. Stephen Beresford's script alone is deliciously witty yet touching, growing into a funny but also deeply poignant work. The film is not ashamed or sneaky in its declaratory left-wing politics, but doesn't taint its case by painting only in black and white, even if it does leave its antagonists a tad thinner than its heroes.\n\nI saw this in a small Finnish movie theatre in the middle of the coldest, completely sunless winter, and it warmed the audience so much it received actual, hand-clapping applause from the Finnish audience as the credits started to roll. Believe me, this better than anything else indicates that \"Pride\" is a force to be reckoned with.",

What Pride did was take a promising true story and deconstruct it bit by bit with countless cliches. Rather than present a layered and complicated narrative the director chooses relentless sentimentality that whitewashes all and any believable character/story development. What surprised me the most was how well received this movie was. I was excited for it based on it's reviews but in the end Pride felt like attending a party where everyone except you is having fun, making it all the worse.",

On the one hand -- especially at this time of year -- it's all about ranking the best from the rest, compiling Top Ten lists, awarding prestigious prizes and statuettes to the most outstanding films and filmmakers, minutely comparing one movie with another.  But, as a matter of course, every film no matter how great or small is critiqued concisely with practically no precision, often on a 4-star scale.  IMDb allows its users to select from an extravagant 10 stars, while other sites offer 5 stars (sometimes with the doubling effect of half-stars).\n\nIf four stars was good enough for Roger Ebert, surely 10 stars at IMDb should be good enough for me ... but no.  This film is a good example of 10 not being enough for me.  No, no, i don't mean i'd like to Spinal Tap it with 11 stars -- what i mean is that this film begs nuance in the range between 7.0 and 7.9.\n\n\"Pride\" is not an 8 out of 10 film for me.  It's very good, for sure, anchored by the gravity of Bill Nighy and Imelda Staunton, and buoyed joyfully by a young unknown(-to-me) cast.  My salty cheeks are evidence that the story's sentimental notes were soundly struck.  But ... it's a little ... too much (?) sometimes -- there may be a few frames, a few lines, that could have been left on the cutting room floor...

The cast is top-notch, the story is both interesting and heartwarming, there are a plethora of hilarious moments, and there's enough conflict for it to hold your attention the whole movie, without really forcing conflict and generally allowing for happiness and teamwork to flourish from early on until the end. It's just a happy movie, you know?\n\nI'm not sure what you could complain about with this movie. I guess some characters are sort of archetypes, but that's necessary with an ensemble cast like this one, and besides, the actors do a great job of making up for their limited screen time by making their few scenes count. It's clear Joe Copper is fictional, a sort of audience surrogate created to introduce us to LGSM, but that's okay, because his stereotypical situation is made genuine thanks to his actor, the strong direction, and the particular details in the script.\n\nThere's also just a lot of beautiful visual moments. The Wales countryside is gorgeous, and the whole visual feel of the movie is colorful and vibrant to match the spirit and optimism of the movie.\n\nI guess one more complaint somebody could make is that the themes are a bit expected, nothing truly new. I'm sure there are aspects of the story that are misrepresented or simplified in the film, and overall the movie is pretty simple. So...I guess I can understand if somebody was looking for a deeper message and was instead met with a treacly or overly sentimental movie. But, to be honest, I don't think every movie needs to be extremely complex or true to life, and it'd be hard for me to make that complaint when I was having so much fun spending time with the characters onscreen. There's just so much unapologetic happiness, from Dominic West's amazing dance scene to the crazy old ladies having fun (I loved all of them) to the gay pride parade at the movie's end. I just had a lot of fun watching the characters, and even if the story and themes are pretty basic, it doesn't make it less moving to see two distinct communities support each other, or to see the simple but effecting image of two hands clasped together.",

They mention the opposing side a few times, but it is more of a statement than a respect to the true story. Don't get me wrong, in the end, I thought this was a great film. Well-made all around and smartly scripted, \"Pride\" delivers in all it's goals, but falls short to those without an open mind, in which I would not recommend. I myself have a very open mind and a broad outlook on life so films like this intrigue me. I think my problem with the film was that once the credits began, I felt no different about the matter than I did before my viewing, but I admired the hell out of what was on screen. \"Pride\" is soulful, but lacking in other areas.",

The resulting culture clash is what gives the movie most of its dramatic power and  \n comedic elements. I never heard about this when it happened; what a great subject for a movie!

The story is all the more amazing in that it happened at a time in which some gays were more concerned and freaked out about self-survival in the face of AIDS than helping some non-gay group not particularly known for their support of gays in the least.

I sat down not knowing what exactly the film was even about other than it was based on a true story dealing with gay rights. More specifically, Pride concerns itself with the 1984 trials of a London-based group of gay and lesbian activists who raise money to support the National Union of Mineworkers who are on strike. The two groups discover that standing together makes for a stronger union for both their causes and generally serves as an inspiring tale all around. What makes the film so rousing and fun while telling an inherently dramatic story is that of the characters and the genuine way in which they interact with one another. From Bill Nighy and Imelda Staunton to Paddy Considine and Dominic West with a cast of exuberant youths in between including Ben Schnetzer, George MacKay and a star-making performance from Jessica Gunning Pride knows where its charm lies and it utilizes that quality to ensure the viewers feel its points. Maybe it was that lack of expectation that made this a more emotionally stirring experience than I expected, but it is also a rather exhilarating study of the human spirit and the kind of, well, pride that comes along with seeing differences set aside for the greater cause. Either that or maybe it's simply because director Matthew Warchus and first time screenwriter Stephen Beresford gauged just the right tone with which to capture this story and allowed their actors to flourish-creating not only a winning film in terms of being entertaining and informative, but a rather moving and intimate portrait of a little-known story that still feels more than relevant today.",

            "content": "This film won the British Independent Film Award over \"Calvary\", \"Mr. Turner\", and \"The Imitation Game\", what a feat! And deservedly it did, although not by a big margin. If only the director had kept up with the dramatic tone, the film would have been much more dramatic and effective, in my opinion, since the subject and theme of this film consist the most fertile ground for a good drama - social struggles for equality mixed with internal quests of finding oneself. My sometimes he fell for lighthearted touches of \"stage/musical\" style, which made the film much more cheerful and up-lifting to watch, but at the same time cut off the emotional stream of feelings by the audience built up by the previous moving sequences (and I just realized that the director is indeed a more accomplished stage director and is planning for a musical adaptation of this film, which I believe will be even more successful due to its stage-suitability). But as a blade having two edges, the cheerful tone of \"Pride\" also brightened up its characters, whose everyday lives were often put in the dark due to the social and political prejudice against miners and LGBT. As such, almost every character in the film stands out and is easily recognizable for their liveliness and their will to fight for what they believe. The weaknesses of the film might be the shaky emotion build-up, as mentioned above, the lack of \"true climax\" (although I did actually enjoy this style - rather having some fun and care-free moments than watching heavy dramas all year long), and a very uneven \"second act\". However, the brief but extremely powerful ending did concluded this film on a high note. If only the film had been a true cinematic drama rather than a stage-alike piece, but not every one can be Sam Mendes (who jumped from his stage career to film career with instant success), so we should sit down and enjoy the film for all the optimistic thoughts it has, which shone through the film like a beam of sun light piercing through the cloudy sky in December.",

Whether as a film about self-discovery, a film about learning to find pride and stand up for yourself, a story about people coming together for a common cause, or a story about how the world changes, not through pushing your own agenda, but by serving others. This film is the picture of how things could change in the world, if people were willing to lay down their own agendas and care more about people than their own agendas.\n\nSure, you may not agree with every political point in this movie, I know I don't, but what I found so moving here is a story of people choosing to care about each other rather than their politics. There is a moment in this movie where a group of women begin singing a song, impromptu, and the emotion of the moment overwhelmed me. It spoke such volumes for what this movie is about. For me, it wasn't about civil rights or even the LGBT community, although that is obviously the huge point of this film. I think the primary takeaway from this film is about how love can overcome anything. \n\nDirector Matthew Warchus does such a beautiful job of telling this story in a way that somehow feels fresh, although it follows a similar track for most \"movement\" movies. What he does is breezes past many of the \"awkward\" coming together moments. He knows what we expect from a film like this, and he's able to play on those conventions in a very effective way. The performances here are also completely wonderful. Everyone brings such care and passion to their characters, that every character has clear and distinct motivations and character arcs. No one feels like filler, and I think that is so important.\n\nThis is a compelling film that was made with such care and passion that you can't help but care about it. If you're able to look past the actual plot of this film, you'll be able to see how so many of us can relate to this, which I think was the point from the beginning. Of course, this is an important true story, and the facts of the story really matter. However, if that's all you take away, I think you missed a lot of this film.",

Like the scene where the entire room of people breaks into song at the town hall.  That was really fucking cheesy.  What I like about the film is how it shows how two seemingly disparate and small groups of people, gays and miners, can come together to make an actual change that rippled throughout both groups.  Gays rights in England were recognized due to the miners' support as they blocked a motion put forward.  Their blocking the motion meant that gays would have equal rights.  While the film does show some of the prejudices that gays go through, I think the film as a bit of an idealistic message.  It's certainly a very nice sentiment, one that I'm entirely supportive of, but one that doesn't show the actual reality of being gay in this world.  It's a sad reality, but I think that the majority of the world is still very homophobic at its core.  We've come so far in so many ways, but in others we've just gone backwards and it's a damn shame that some people, fearing retribution or homophobia, spend their entire lives living a life that is not their own.  It's a sad truth.  This movie doesn't overlook that sad truth, as Bromley struggles with his sexuality as he can't tell his family who he really is.  It also shows the beginning of AIDS, but, again, it doesn't focus as much on that so as not to put too much of a downer on things.  Thankfully the film makes up with a wicked sense of humor.  The film is very funny and entertaining as the gays ingratiate themselves with the miners as they grow closer to each other the more they, being the miners, understand.  It's a cliched theme, but this film handles it well and respectfully.  This, as you may have guessed, has an excellent cast of great British actors and actresses.  Imelda Staunton and Bill Nighy are incredible.  I could watch these two perform in German, without subtitles, for two hours and I'd be absolutely enthralled.  Both are fabulous here and they add a level of credibility to anything they're in.  And Paddy Considine is nobody to scoff at either.  I really love the cast here, the characters are likable and, while many, there's still some depth to a lot of them.  It might not be great depth, but they're not one dimensional characters either.  The soundtrack is also really good, it fits the era perfectly.  I loved this movie as you can see.  It's not as manipulative and sentimental as it could've been and that's a positive in my book.  I can find very little to dislike about this.  I love this movie very much.  It's funny, heartbreaking, insightful, well-acted, and well-written.  I'd definitely recommend this movie.",

I am counting to have this in my final top 10 of the year. I loved this movie.\n\nThe very solid and confident direction sustains an amazing script that combined with the stunning, superb cast makes this movie what it is. It's funny, dramatic, uplifting, subtle all in one. I came out totally inspired, feeling better about life. All of this works well because the movie is never, ever manipulative as happens for 90% of true stories movies. It is so brilliantly underplayed, with attention to small things over larger than life concepts. It makes you appreciate humanity in its truest forms, you follow a large amount of characters and you get to know them all profoundly. Some movies don't even manage to make you appreciate the main character, this one manages to make you emphasize with more than a dozen. None of these are overplayed or exaggerated people, they all feel honest and real, by the end of the movie I felt so involved with them, it seemed I had known them forever. I can't stress enough how good the character work is here, it is so rare to find such a treasure. But all of this wouldn't be possible without the cast assembled. With the SAG nominations just out this week, I just want to make a point about how disgusting is the awards machine, the awards campaigning. It takes away what they should be really about which is true quality, not shaking hands! This to say that it's preposterous for this movie not to have been nominated for best ensemble. It's so unfair. This cast deserves to win that f**** award! This is the best cast ensemble performance I have seen in way too long. And is destroys me not to see this movie have the attention it deserves only because it is a too small movie and doesn't have the support of the other bigger independents. This is what awards should do, bring about to the public these gems of cinema. But that's me bragging. Point is: cast=amazing, amazing, amazing! Faye Marsay in particular was just a force of nature on the screen, I literally couldn't take my eyes off her. Even in the scenes where she served as background I was looking at her, she was so into her role.\n\nThis movie doesn't make it to a 9 for me by just a millimeter. It had some cringe moments, some slightly over the top/surreal interventions, some storytelling shortcutting that kept me from forgetting this was a movie. They aren't frequent, but when they came they took some of the magic away and lessened the end result. Yet, that's all I have to say on the negative side.\n\nGo see this movie now! You will come out feeling like a better person, wanting to do something good for the world.",

            "content": "With a lot of critical praise surrounding it, Pride sounded like a delightful romp.\n\nI didn't expect what I got from Pride, and I loved it. Like a lot of films about homosexuals standing up in the face of adversity, Pride is an inspiring film. But the difference between Pride and films like Milk, Pride is easily inspiring and energetic in the best possible manner. Its story is pretty simple and so it paves the way for its limitations by adding in a natural touch of comedy, and while it can only go so far since its story tries to be about the larger scale of things as well as its characters while succeeding predominantly at the latter, it succeeds as a touching, uplifting and hilarious film.\nPride does have some problems in trying to focus on its characters and the larger scale of events. When it focuses on its characters, there are so many for it to follow that it never really consistently sticks to on, and it spends so much time focused on that which results in the scale being temporarily brought down. When it gets back to the larger scale of things, that is when the spirit of the film truly begins to shine. \nPride tells an excellent story that I was unfamiliar with prior to seeing the film. It chronicles the LGSM (Lesbians and Gays Support the Minors) on their quest to stand up for the British Miners' Strike of 1984. It is a tale about an oppressed community not just standing up for their own cause, but using their passion to help out others who have been oppressed by people in power for so long. The connection between these two is excellent, and it projects an even more positive look of the LGBT community due to showing how even in times of oppression they stood together and helped out other communities. In terms of its themes, Pride examines the sexuality of these people and how it was reflected in 1980's British society with brutal honesty, yet with a lighthearted nature which makes the experience easier, more enjoyable and less prone to falling into melodramatic territory. The way that the people stood up is inspiring, and the tone of the film is always appropriately uplifting even when it has moments of serious drama. The tone of the film and its spirit remains consistent, and the humour all falls into place easily. Thanks to a brilliant script which is fool of sensible British slang, Pride feels like the real film that it intends to be. It also puts a lot of great emphasis into the humour of homosexuality in the context where it crosses paths with the elderly community. There is much humour in the way that the older crowds in Onllwyn interact with the homosexuals and Lesbians of the LGSM community, particularly in the way the older women embrace the community in such a warm and hilarious way. The contrast between their personas and engagement of cultures is where a large source of the humour in the film comes into play while a lot of emphasis is put on the hilarious stereotypical elements of the community in general. Pride is full of hilarious material and a well-crafted script helps to give the film that edge as well as a lot of strong characters to assist it all in progressing. So Pride is both a hilarious film and a powerfully inspiring one which tells its story with plenty of energetic charm to keep it consistently entertaining.\nAnd to keep in tune with the fabulous charm of the LGTB community, Pride comes off as a very stylish film. The scenery of the film is beautiful and the production design is great in establishing the time frame of the film and giving it a sense of vibrant colour which is all there. It is captured with strong cinematography as well which keeps things on the appropriate scale on a consistent basis. The soundtrack for the film is also fabulous, and the collection of costumes for the characters really does a fine job illuminating the energetic passion of fashion in the gay pride community which gives the film a lot of colour. The spirit of the film is in its humour, its story, the way it looks and the way it sounds. It is everywhere in the film, and so enjoying it is too easy to do.\nAnd the cast of the film do their part as well. Every actor contributes to the film in some way or another, and a few of them stick out.\nBen Schnetzer is the standout in Pride. In the part fo Mark Ashton, he plays the leader of LGSM, and his passion in the part is undeniable. He captures the perfect flamboyant demeanour for the role in a manner which is clear without being over the top, and he puts more focus into the determination of the character to ensure that his people succeed in helping out their brothers and sisters who are suffering in the mining community. He is great because he is thoroughly engaging in the part and remains emotionally involved the entire time with a spirit which is just too admirable.\nGeorge Mackay is also strong. While his character is a fictional creation, he brings a great sense of drama to the story as it begins to develop. As he gets involved with the LGBT community, we get to see more of who he is as he comes to terms with his own identity. And when the story challenges him to be really dramatic, he comes out shining spectacularly well. George Mackay develops his character strongly over the course of Pride, and so he makes a compelling effort in his role without any doubt.\nImelda Staunton is perfect. While I will always have her immortalized in my mind as the evil Dolores Umbridge from the Harry Potter films, in Pride she is just hilarious. She provides such a compelling and likable character to the story and brings a true sense of support to the entire movement which strengthens it as a whole. Not just that, but she is funny the entire time because whenever the situation demands any humour, she brings it and does it so organically. Imelda Staunton brings a hilarious persona to Pride so easily that it is just unforgettable.\nLastly, Bill Nighy is a welcome presence. While he has his funny moments in Pride, the importance of his role in the film is predicated mostly on what he does with the dramatic material. Easily enough, he blitzes it and nothing less. Bill Nighy stands seriously strong in his part in Pride and remains likable throughout the story while developing the strength of his dramatic abilities the entire time without any shortcomings. Bill Nighy does his part in the film really greatly, and he has some really skilful moments of interaction with the surrounding cast.\n\nSo Pride is simple film with a great story, plenty of humour, a lot of inspirational spirit and a wonderful cast which overlooks its minor story flaws.",

            "content": "The story begins in 1984 London on the day of the gay pride parade. One of the attendees is Joe, a closeted 20-year-old who still lives at home with his parents. Joe is hesitant about marching at first, but soon falls in with a group led by Mark Ashton, just a few years Joe's senior but a born leader.  \n\nMark, inspired by a newscast he saw that morning about an ongoing miners' strike, decides that he and his friends should use the march to collect money to support the miners since both gays and miners are being oppressed by the Thatcher regime. He takes his idea a step further after the parade, forming a small group called Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners (LGSM) whose members (which include Joe) agree to stand on street corners collecting donations in plastic buckets.  But when the miners' union is reluctant to accept money from a gay group, they choose a small mining village in Wales to support directly.\n\nThe saving grace of \"Pride\" is that it's largely true. Mark Ashton was a real person, LGSM was a real organization, and their alliance with a village in Wales really happened. Even though some aspects of the story  (the character of Joe, for example) are clearly fictional, the far-fetched notion of a young gay activist choosing to focus his energies on helping a group of small town miners a couple of hundred miles away isn't one of them. \n\n\"Pride\" touches on just about everything you would expect it to: AIDS, gay bashing, homophobia, coming out. The movie really takes off when the LGSM contingent pays their first visit to their not-very-welcoming beneficiaries. It ends up being a feel-good audience-pleaser that leaves you wondering if the world wouldn't be a better place if it was inhabited mostly by young gays and middle-aged straight women, with perhaps the occasional straight guy who wants to learn how to dance so he can pick up chicks.\n\nYes it's predictable, yes it has its share of clich\u00e9s, but this is still a remarkable and even inspiring story that leaves you with the sense that maybe one person really CAN change the world. Not ME of course - I'm far too lazy - but the rest of you should get right on it.",

At times, it is hard to resist the good-natured humour and feel-good moments. But overall, PRIDE tries to pack too many stories into the one movie, follows too many characters, and eventually becomes bogged down in trying to include just about every cliche possible in a nice uplifting experience. It feels too long and at least 30 minutes of its 2hr running time could have been safely removed.\n\nDespite it's flaws, it does get its message across - it just could have been done in a lot better way.\n\nWait for the DVD.\n\n***",

The films mostly showcase the bonding of local communities initially at odds, as they triumphantly strive towards a common cause. These types of film seem to strike a chord with audiences worldwide, generating lots of overflowing emotions and big buzz come award time.  PRIDE is exactly that, this year's 'feel the goosebumps good'  movie and, as it turns out, deservingly so.  Helmed by famed West-End director Matthew Warchus, the film sets itself up nicely, highlighting its intentions rather quickly and then, thanks to a moving if predictable script, and some first-rate casting, works its charm, seducing us with its clear-cut agenda of the good underdog versus the horrible just about anybody else.  It's essentially gay rights against all ignorance and it all seems harmless, even in its set-up of conflict.  And despite its unusual angle, PRIDE does not come off as particularly original but, more importantly, it does have its heart in the right place, even if way too obviously so.  What makes PRIDE so winning a  film is that it's relentless in making you feel for the characters, their struggle and their era.  It may only  be set thirty years ago but in this 'based on' period piece, the  nostalgia  seems like forever and a day.  PRIDE works because its characters are filled with even more love than pride itself. Expect to cry, tears of joy.",

It's set in London (and Wales) in 1984 and follows a small group of gay & lesbian activists who decide to do stand up to the Thatcher government - not for gay rights, but for the rights of the striking miners! It's all handled quite well and doesn't become a full on drama, or a full on comedy - or even a full on \"political\" or \"gay\" movie. \n\nSure, there's definitely lots of political messages being explored - and you would like to think the world, in general, is a more tolerant place 30 years later - but the film's really about this group of six friends banding together and supporting another put-upon group, a small mining community in Wales. This is where a lot of the humour comes from - the old Welsh ladies having fun with \"their gays\" and \"their lesbians\"! \n\nThe cast is superb - even though Nighy is probably under-utilised - with Mark (Schnetzer) & Joe (McKay) particularly captivating. The soundtrack/score is also great, although there's obviously some disco! Well-paced and with a great ending, this is a very enjoyable film.",

I can't think of any examples right off the bat that hit both (they're kinda polar opposites), but I did hit both between two movies within a week of each other. Gone Girl hit the disturbing button quite square on the nose. Pride left me really really happy.\n\nPride takes place in England during the miners strikes in the mid-80s. A group of LBGT kids, recognizing the similarities in their struggles, rally together to raise money for and support a small mining town. Prejudices have to be overcome on both sides, and both come to find a love and acceptance they never expected.\n\nYeah yeah yeah that sounds very sappy. And it was. But I didn't care. Some of these kids had never felt that acceptance before, and it was beautiful to see. Each of the characters were sweet and unique, and I loved following each of them, seeing how various mining families basically adopted one of the gay kids. I texted a handful of my friends on the way out, encouraging them to see this if they had a chance.

Many of the characters are carbon cut-outs and many of the plot devices familiar but it is utterly irresistible. Dominic West who cut his teeth as Detective Jimmy McNulty in the HBO drama series The Wire, and scared the life out of me as mass-murderer Fred West in the  creepy TV mini-series Appropriate Adult, steals the film in my opinion as flamboyant gay Jonathan especially his dance scene in a Welsh village pub.

            "content": "For more reviews, visit www.bemovieseemovie.com.\n\nPride is the injection the movies needed. 2014's fall season has been filled with bleak nihilistic films about the poor state of the world. Pride wants none of that: it forces its way into your hearts and minds by sheer determination. It also helps that it is a socially conscious well-made film about fascinating complicated people coming together to support a worthy cause. Man, just writing that last sentence gave me goosebumps and unbridled happiness.\n\nGreat Britain was crippled in 1984 by a Miners' Strike, with the government waging a war against the working class.  Especially hard hit is a small town in Wales, run by a small council lead by Dai (Paddy Considine), Hefina (Imelda Staunton), and Cliff (Bill Nighy). Coming to their aide is an unlikely source: a group called the Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners (LGSM).  This group consists of Joe (George MacKay), a smothered boy just coming out; Steph (Faye Marsay), a demonstrative loyal supporter, Jonathan (Dominic West), the elder statesman of the LGBT movement, and angry powerful leader Mark (Ben Schnetzer). These strange bedfellows join forces to fight for the miners in multiple ways: fundraising, moral support, basic resources , etc. However, the fight is on multiple fronts for both sides: suppressive government on one side, prejudice on the other.\n\nPride feels like it exists in 1984.  The movie gets the era details right, giving context and extra poignance for some of the issues the groups have to fight. The clothes, hairdos, and music match the androgynous sexual nature of 80's culture well. The AIDS issue permeates the background of the movie, always threatening to become the central story, and much like the disease, just pops up when you least expect it. Family dynamics in regards to homosexuality are filled with fear and sometimes bigotry. The movie goes to great lengths to show just how counterculture the LGBT movement was in the 1980s, and how easily polarized their efforts could be construed.\n\nDon't feel bad for anyone in this film though; Pride is nothing short of euphoric. The movie's open-mindedness is genuinely touching. Early on the film, Dai is forced to give a speech in a gay bar. The scene is set up for him to crash and burn, and instead, what occurs is a touching show of humility toward a group of people who receive none. The mutual support allows multiple characters who lack power at the start of the film to rise up and accept the challenges of their plight to meet them head on. Joe gets courage to stand up to his family and accept who he is. Gethin (Andrew Scott) attempts to reconnect with his religious mother. Sian (Jessica Gunning) breaks out of her housewife role to forge a path for herself. Each moral victory generates momentum and courage for another character to do something brave to make their worlds a better place to live, a powerful message for anyone desiring to make a change.\n\nPride succeeds in no small part because of the eclectic combination of actors that make up its cast. Relative unknown Ben Schnetzer is dynamite as LGSM's leader, Mark. Mark's resolve and charisma forms the backbone of the movement and driving force for the story: if we don't believe Mark, the movie has no legs to stand on. Schnetzer imbues optimism and civic duty to Pride, and he also gives Mark enough layers that hide a deeper fear of mortality that resonate in the third act. Jessica Gunning and George MacKay sell their terrific arts as the frustrated housewife and the timid boy working up the nerve to come out. Surrounding the unknown cast are seasoned British vets. Imelda Staunton finally gets a chance to use her tightly-wound personality for a good cause, and Bill Nighy/Paddy Considine conveys quiet understanding as elder statesman of the mining community. Dominic West and Andrew Scott get the most satisfying arcs: as veterans of the LGBT cause, they get chances to see the youth push for something special. Scott in particular gets a chance to put a band aid over some long festering emotional wounds.\n\nIt's amazing how a small gesture can make a gloomy situation more bright. Pride is a great reminder about collectivism. Sure, it is scary to feel alone and ostracized, but out there is someone who shares those similar feelings, and if you join forces to support what you believe in, the sum of your influences is greater that either individual. Pride made me well up with joy and satisfaction, and gives me hope for any future with people like these brave souls involved.",

That's Pride, a Brit dramedy that is the best kind of crowd-pleaser: one that doesn't insult your intelligence and hit you over the head with unearned schmaltz. Even when it is pummeling the heartstrings you still believe every word of it.\n\nThese are the facts: in 1984, the National Union of Mineworkers went on strike over pit closures and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's deplorable policies. The film, vibrantly directed by stage master Matthew Warchus (Matilda) from a script by Stephen Beresford, centers on the unlikely help offered by the gay and lesbian community of London. Its Mark (the terrific Ben Schnetzer) who puts together the LGSM (Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners) to give the striking families some much needed backup by drawing parallels between the disenfranchised miners and the oppression endured by their own community under the iron boots of conservatism. Any resemblance between these groundbreakers and the battles still being waged for civil rights is purely intentional. Pride is hardly subtle about the points it wants to put across, but its sad these points need to be made still.\n\nWhen the miners union initially turn the group down, they go rouge and make their case in person to the miners in Dulais, a small mining village in South Wales. You may be imagining Welsh homophobia being chilled  by the generous goodwill of their gay and lesbian benefactors, well, you wouldn't be too off. Some folks take beatings, and some bigots remain who they are.\n\nYou'll cheer loudly for all of the actors, especially Imelda Staunton, Bill Nighy and Paddy Considine as the Welsh locals, and Dominic West, Fay Marsay and George MacKay as the members of LGSM. Pride is a film that has its heart set on changing the world. Call it naive, but there's no hating on a film with so much ambition and fighting spirit. I couldn't have loved it more.",

            "content": "If, like me, you grew up with the songs of Pete Seeger played loudly, and proudly, in your home, then the opening credits of \"Pride\" will immediately strike a welcome chord. My song of choice, as a child, was \"Little Boxes\" - which I listened to gleefully without understanding a word of the lyrics - but as I aged I gained a greater appreciation of the humanism and progressive ideology of the man, of which his great workers' anthem, \"Solidarity Forever\" - the title music of theater director Matthew Warchus's new film - is a powerful example. In the spirit of the late champion of labor rights (among other causes) and promoter of rousing feel-good folk songs, \"Pride\" is a movie which - though contrived and overly sentimental at times - will leave you profoundly moved and hopeful. It's a film that promotes the (radical!) notion that there are other ideas worth rallying around than patriotism and fear. In a midterm election year, that's not a bad thing to keep in mind.\n\nThe film - based on true events, as a title card informs us - takes place in the 1980s United Kingdom of the Margaret Thatcher era, beginning with one London Gay Pride March - on June 30, 1984 - and ending with another, one year later. One day, 20-something activist Mark (a charming Ben Schnetzer, from \"The Book Thief\") notices a diminution in the numbers of police harassing young gays like himself, and figures out where they've all gone: to harass the country's miners, all of whom are out on strike. Not content to work only on behalf of his own constituency - and understanding full well how workers and oppressed minorities are all connected (and how his community is directly benefiting from police distraction) - Mark gathers a small coterie of fellow gay men (and one lesbian) to raise money in support of the miners. It's a hard sell - many gays and lesbians have long suffered severe bullying and discrimination at the hands of their working-class brethren - but Mark is a charismatic leader, and soon his group - LGSM (\"Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners\") has raised enough cash to be worth donating. The problem is ... to whom? For while gays and lesbians may be able to unite in support of the miners, it proves a bit harder to find miners willing to accept help from gays and lesbians. This is the 1980s, after all.\n\nFortunately, for the eventual betterment of all concerned, an older Welsh union worker misunderstands the name of the group over the phone, and soon a strike leader, Dai - played by an excellent Paddy Considine (\"Submarine\") - is on his way to London for a meet & greet. The awkward (yet very funny) first sit-down sets the tone for the rest of the film, as Dai, Mark and the rest of LGSM conclude that what binds them is greater than what separates them. Convincing the rest of the world of the same is what drives the plot of the film. With laughter and tears - most of it earned - the movie takes us on a satisfying journey that - even with its almost too-perfect conclusion - refuses to gloss over the harsh realities of the world. With great performances from all involved - including Bill Nighy (\"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\"), Imelda Staunton (\"Vera Drake\"), Dominic West (McNulty from \"The Wire\"), Andrew Scott (Moriarty on \"Sherlock\"), and especially Jessica Dunning (whom I had never seen before), among others - \"Pride\" is a wonderful treat, and just what you need to see this weekend.

            "content": "\"Pride\" is the very close to perfect movie that it seems only the English know how to make. It pulls at your heart strings, makes you smile and laugh, then ends making you want to cheer!\n\nThe movie is based on a true story about a group of Lesbians and Gays from London who go to Llandello, Wales, after collecting money to help the striking miners, showing solidarity between two groups who are marginalized, oppressed and shunned, especially by the government.\n\nThe film opens with the Gay Pride March in 1984 and ends with the Gay Pride March in 1985. In between we see the interaction between the Gays and miners, some of the latter accepting the former while some are against them. There is really only one villain as through various actions, conversations and incidents most come to accept each other.\n\nMost of the characters are clich\u00e9s from the boy on the verge of coming out to the man in the village who has lived his life in the closet but the actors make you forget what you know is going to happen. Each actor gets a 'star' turn and though some have bigger roles, such as Bill Nighy, Imelda Staunton, Ben Schnetzer, Paddy Consindine, Andrew Scott, Dominic West and George MacKay than others all earn a well deserved acknowledgement so be sure to stay for the credits.\n\nIt is almost a perfect movie but the director, Matthew Warchus, and the screenwriter, Stephen Beresford, try to cover too many characters and don't have, or take the time, to see them through while original music by Christopher Nightingale at times overcomes the scenes.\n\nAll in all this is definitely a movie to see and, on a personal note, I want to take the next flight to Llandello, Carmartheshire and Danwen in Wales, plus drive across that magnificent bridge. I did research but couldn't find out the name of the bridge so if anyone knows please let me know!",

Tony Award-winning director and dramatist Matthew Warchus (God of Carnage) directs from a script by Stephen Beresford. It simplifies in the clearest possible approach to present a feel good tale that effectively manipulates the emotions. By focusing the struggle on a small, but distinct circle of people, the audience can connect to the intimate human drama that played out in the much larger public arena. The lightness of tone when dealing with heavy issues is appreciated. In the process it sidesteps the pitfalls that could've made this account preachy or didactic. This might alienate some seeking more hard hitting controversy, but the script fashions a narrative much in the way a powerful sports movie works. It creates a David and Goliath story and invites you to cheer for the underdog.\n\nfastfilmreviews.com",

            "content": "THE FULL MONTY spawned an entire category of films I like to call the QUAINT ENGLISH VILLAGE MOVIE.  It started out great, but then one after the other just kept coming - WAKING NED DEVINE, THE ENGLISHMAN WHO WENT UP A HILL BUT CAME DOWN A MOUNTAIN, CALENDAR GIRLS, BILLY ELLIOT - and while individually good, enough already!  So I came to PRIDE with crossed arms and a bitter attitude.  Man was I being a dick.  This is just a terrific movie, no ifs, ands, or buts.  \n\nBased on the remarkable 1984 true story of the infamous Miner's strike in Thatcher England which found unlikely bedfellows in the form of support from a London-based LGBT group, PRIDE is better than its terrible title.  Initially I thought it was a documentary about gay pride parades.  The actual story is far more compelling than my assumptions.  Identifying with the bullying tactics inflicted on the strikers, a small group of gay men and one lesbian take to the streets with buckets to collect spare change.  \n\nThey are led by Mark (Ben Schnetzer), a very strong-willed, politically astute young man who makes the connection between the two oppressed groups.  Although the miners were notorious homophobes, he pushes forward and enlists the aid of his community.  They encounter initial resistance from the Union, so instead they engage a small Welsh mining village directly and work hard to bond with the locals.  \n\nThis is a very large, unwieldy cast and the screenplay by Stephen Beresford is overstuffed with incident, but director Matthew Warchus masterfully juggles all of the balls in the air and creates an emotionally overpowering and lovely cinematic experience.  Along with Mark, there's George MacKay as Joe, the closeted newbie who goes on an inspiring hero's journey throughout.  Andrew Scott is a true find as Gethin, a gay bookstore owner who must face his Welsh heritage.  Closely resembling Mark Ruffalo, Scott gives a fantastic performance as a man who has lived in fear and shame for too long.  Dominic West, best known for THE WIRE, shines in a small but crucial role as Gethin's partner.  \n\nOn the village side, there is none other than the legends, Imelda Staunton, Paddy Considine and  Bill Nighy, who are all very strong, but the heart and soul of this film belongs to Jessica Gunning as Sian, a fierce advocate for her new friends and a force of nature whether she's stomping into police stations or reprimanding her husband for showing any hint of homophobia.   I have the feeling, much as I did when I saw TRAINSPOTTING, that PRIDE has the potential to launch major careers with Schnetzer, MacKay and Gunning.  These are immensely appealing actors whom you can't help but cheer.  \n\nIt's not perfect.  Not every storyline is resolved.  In fact a major one concerning a bitter matriarch and her two gay-bashing sons doesn't even come close.  Also, I found it a bit odd that some characters were given WHERE ARE THEY NOW cards at the end, while others didn't get a mention.  No matter, as this is a rousing, spirited call to action.  There's a non-profit group in existence right now called GAY4GOOD, where its volunteers reach out to other communities to help bag groceries, clean parks, etc.  This organization stands on the shoulders of these brave, colorful, vivid activists from 30 years ago.  They risked their lives and reputations to stand beside others in need.  PRIDE is a crowd-pleasing rallying call.  It won't change cinema, but in this troubled world we find ourselves in, changing hearts and minds is more important.",

This movie will likely be a treat for audiences of any age (though old age in particular) because it's fun and celebratory. It's inspirational.\nThe film is unusually focused on a large number of characters, but this works well because each has a unique personality and a different take from each actor. The film is edited cohesively and seamlessly splices together their personal struggles with group efforts. From this, we get all kinds of perspective within the movement, and seeing the group succeed and struggle becomes very powerful because of this.\nI don't think this is simply a \"yay, gay people\" film. The antagonists may be one-note and the movie certainly tries to make us feel good for being on its side, but at large, it celebrates the movement itself. The film proves, as the title suggests, that pride is what is needed for a rights movement to succeed, or for an individual. With that, this film has social importance, and should serve very well to inspire its audiences on good old-fashioned activism.",

But from my perspective, there was little to this film but emotional appeal based around today's liberal ideologies. \n\nI'm not saying there is anything wrong with those ideologies, but rather I'm pointing out that there is no compelling thematic argument here. The filmmakers made the film around liberal appeal. They give us more scenes to cheer at than they do scenes that provoke any thought, or develop characters, or even tell the story. It's like watching a flag wave for over an hour, and I doubt the earliest viewers of Triumph of the Will were any less exhilarated than most people in my theatre. \n\nAnd it's true, we don't need to be convinced that they are right, and therefore the film doesn't have to convince us. 2012's Lincoln didn't need to prove to us that the thirteenth amendment was justified in passing. But what it could have offered is the perspective of the people who do not support the movement instead of repeatedly insisting that it's because they all have sticks up their asses. What is driving those characters? How can we get them to see our perspective? If this film has any logical appeal to its argument, it is \"because if you're on our side you're fun and open minded!\" which obviously doesn't suffice for one. People will see this movie for the same reason conservatives watch Bill O'Reilly on Fox News: he's on their side, he's confident that his side is the correct one, and therefore how he says things is more important than he it says. This film has nothing to prove, and therefore nothing new to say.\n\nI became tired at the singing and the dancing and the just-because jokes. Forget the plot, our side is fun, because Look! We're having fun! Every character's empathy is earned simply by the fact that they are for the movement, that they are progressives. The protagonist in the film is not one character but the movement itself. Although there are a couple of central characters, none are given enough of a story to be compelling. But who cares about that when they're on our side? Let's just have a party instead and have everyone break out in song (this sort of happens).\n\nIf you liked this movie, good for you. If you loved this movie, good for you. I just don't understand people thinking it's a particularly good movie. Effective maybe, but actually good, I'm not convinced.",

Imelda Staunton, Dominic West, Andrew Scott and Paddy Considine give real heart and humour to the film. The anti-gay prejudice is probably under-played for the time and the shadow of AIDs that was arguably a bigger fight than Thatcher vs the NUM, is only touched on right at the end. Instead, this is a funny and touching film that draws you in with its well drawn characters and a strong sense of those 1980s days. Great performances and an uplifting message.",

In a touching scene between two young characters, one urges the other to not run away but leave a difficult situation, but on his own terms, with a sense of Pride.\nPolitically, we know how the story ends for the miners.

            "content": "There are countless films about love, but you will be hard pressed to find one better than Pride, because that's what the film is about; love. It's not a love story as such. There is no boy-meets-girl , but it is about love and how we as humans love one another.\n\nPride tells us the story of Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners (LGSM); a group of (surprise, surprise) gay men and women who supported the miner's strike of the mid 80s. Led by Mark Ashton (Ben Schnetzer), LGSM struggled to find any miners willing to accept any money from \"their kind\", until they happened across one South Wales mining community that did just that. \n\nAs a film maker, I have been trained to analyse everything I watch; to critically look at the framing of each scene and how the choices made by these particular film makers helps to tell the story written in words. It is extremely rare to find a film where this instinct to analyse doesn't kick in while watching it, but Pride is one of the very few films to have achieved this. \nFrom a technical point of view Pride is not the most beautifully shot film we will see this year, there will be no awards for editing or sound design or any of that. It's a simply put together piece of cinema, but this simplicity just allows the fantastic story to shine through. You really won't be able to help but feel a strong sense of joy and hope by the end of the film, and to truly believe in humanity and community spirit.\n\nThere are few weaknesses (very few) but in the interest of being balanced I'll go into some depth. There are several impressive Welsh accents on display, Paddy Considine and Andrew Scott in particular hit the nail on the head. Bill Nighy, however didn't quite pull it off. When he had to really stress emotion in his voice, he slipped into his usual deep tones that we all know and love. I understand the importance of the character of Cliff being Welsh, but if he'd been the customary English then it would have been forgivable I think. It also seemed a little bit of a stretch when Jonathan (Dominic West) won over the vast majority of the village people (not that Village People, though) by showing off his commendable dance skills. \n\nI'm afraid I have to use a big clich\u00e9 to summarise here, but it must be done. If you're only going to watch one film this year, then make sure it's Pride, because it is well and truly deserving of the patronage of every single one of us.",

Despite some inevitable predictability in the story lines (more forgivable in this instance for the clever and intricate ways they have interwoven them together), this is mainstream enough to appeal to the masses without alienating the more unique, almost niched, market this is equally aimed for. Not only do we get a moving and educational account of the struggles faced by the Welsh miners back in the 80s but also that of the gay movement at the same time. Two struggles for the price of one, indeed. Great performances all round from an ensemble composing of a who's who in Britcom casting and a script that feels genuine, emotional and not tokenistic despite the wide ranging number of issues it managed to touch on. It could have gone very wrong, yet the outcome here is pleasingly satisfying without being patronising or trivial - and that is something that doesn't often come by these days.",

It feels a little televisual and swerves between markers of poignancy and shrieking tweefulness, but its heart is in the right place, which counts for a lot.

            "content": "\"Ohh this takes me back..\"\r\n\r\nWhat a strange week Iv'e had. Liking 'Let's Be Cops' a critically panned movie and now this. A critically Acclaimed movie that I'm not too hot on. But then again I don't feel at all surprised. Touted as similar to 'Billy Elliot' and 'The Full Monty' the chances were minimal that I'd like it (Given I don't like either and can't stand the former.)\r\n\r\n'Pride' is a film set during the 80s in Thatcher's government a time coal miners were being bullied and belittled. It was also a time of gay and lesbians being victimised in a similar fashion. So a group calling themselves 'LGSM' support a little mining village in Wales. Based on a true story of how too groups of people come together to change things for the good. The story at just over 2hrs is a little too long for my liking but overall it's paced well and teh story and message is heard loud and clear - in proud like fashion. It doesn't shy too much away from the prejudice of gay and lesbians of time nor does it go into too much detail - something a lesser film would have done. As teh writer knows the point of the story and reason why these to came together too help each other.\r\n\r\nBut the story wasn't my problem it was the 'comedy'. It falls as flat as a piece of paper and consists of gay jokes, clueless welsh valley girls and not much else. It's not offensive in any manner, don't get me wrong and it treats both subjects with a grace - I just found the jokes incredibly wanting. I'll admit my funny bone and British humour tend not to align despite it being my country Iv'e always gotten on better with American humour. So taking my thoughts with a pinch of salt here is best. It's a shame really because other than that - the story is fine, great even, the acting is fine and the feel good factor is there.\r\n\r\nEven though I always say I'll give any film a fair chance - I have to accept there are certain types of films I just won't get on with. This is clearly one of them, despite the positive message and interesting (as well as unknown) story. It failed to get anything more than a small chuckle out of me - and as a comedy as well as a drama that's not goo d enough. I can't have one side of the coin and ignore the other. I didn't dislike it but I didn't like it either. Ultimately this is for someone else - those who enjoyed 'The Full Monty' and 'Billy Elliot'.",

To see the difference of the Gay Pride march back then compared to now makes you pleased to see how far we have come. Any film with Bill Nighy in for me is a winner, but the whole cast in this film is ace. The film has echos of Billy Elliott meets The Full Monty.",

It is full of humour and tension but ultimately so heart-warming the tears were streaming down my face. I loved it when the little old Welsh lady asked to be shown all of London's gay nightlife including \"the rubber scene\".  It restores my faith in humanity and traditional British fairness and good nature. I had wondered how we turned around the institutionalised homophobia of the 1980s which saw Britain's LGBT people crushed under the Sexual Offences Act to the legal enshrinement of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act of 2013 - in only a few short decades?

It's not like it's a mess; the overbearing music and wear-your-heart-on-your-sleeve-at-all-times direction seems to be what's the most manipulating (for lack of a better word). What's odd, though, is that I only one two of the characters' names and that this is way less affecting than it should be. The clear positive here is the acting and I enjoyed seeing Paddy Considine in a less comedic role; I really liked him in Hot Fuzz and The World's End so it was a bit refreshing to see him do something slightly different. Other than the humor working about half of the time, I don't understand the love for this movie. Also, it's two hours due to excessive subplots. I don't get why filmmakers can't just cut their own movies to what's really needed. 6.3/10, okay, one thumb down, average, etc.",
