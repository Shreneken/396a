    "summary": "Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell) and his brothers, Morgan (Bill Paxton) and Virgil (Sam Elliott), have left their gunslinger ways behind them to settle down and start a business in the town of Tombstone, Ariz. While they aren't looking to find trouble, trouble soon finds them when they become targets of the ruthless Cowboy gang. Now, together with Wyatt's best friend, Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer), the brothers pick up their guns once more to restore order to a lawless land.",

            "content": "An All Time Classic. The acting is phenomenal overall. Val Kilmer gives one of the most iconic performances of the genre and what's more impressive is Russell is able to not be overshadowed by him either doing an excellent job balancing being likeable, charming, and a badass while never being over the top. Baxton is good and Elliott & Delaney are very good as well. The villains are good but the one thing that holds them back from being as good as their foes is they come across as very over the top and forced. I wish they would've been more subtle. Boothe comes across as he's trying to be Lee Marvin with varying degrees of success. The cinematography is excellent overall. The camerawork is amazing with tons of influence from Ford, Leone, and a overall Spielberg/Donner tone. The locations are really memorable as well never feeling generic. The special effects and action are extremely well done with the only complaint being sometimes it can go a bit over the top and feels unneeded but 90% of the time it works very well. The whole film has the look of a Modern Era big budget western done in a ungritty style. The music is amazing in this as well. The editing is very good but is the weakest part. There are certain scenes that feel unneeded like the opening wedding massacre which feels over the top and you could take out, and the film has trouble sometimes transitioning between Wyatt's Brothers, Wyatt, The Bad Guys and Doc in the first half but does a good job. There are a couple of great cuts in this and it has a unique identity of a big budget western done in a Golden Era style during ironically enough a time when the Western had faded away. This is phenomenally paced as well with great action, drama, and tension despite going over the top occasionally. And as the second half focuses more on Doc & Wyatt it never lets up. This is something everyone should check out once. this is truly one of the last great Westerns.",

            "content": "Tombstone is the most \"Hollywoodified\" Western I have ever seen, and I'm not saying that as a bad thing. Examples include, but are not limited to, Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell) stumbling into the pouring rain with his brother's blood coating his outstretched arms, Wyatt Earp going full Leroy Jenkins out into the creek during a gunfight (I actually hated this part), tears shed as one friend visits another on his deathbed, long gazes between forbidden lovers, the Robert Mitchum narration, the four horsemen riding side-by-side through the plains, the end credits, the score in general, and lots of shoot 'em up violence. This, of course, also includes some excellent quotes, \"You gonna do something or just stand there and bleed?\" \"You called down the thunder, well now you got it!\" And most notable, \"I'm your huckleberry.\" Gosh dang does owning a saloon on the main strip of a frontier town look fun (drinkin', gamblin', smokin', prostitutin'), except for the frequent gunfights and fear that the consumption might take hold. Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday is one of those roles that seems to teeter between Oscar and Razzie, but by the end credits, it's definitely the former \u2014 perhaps a little hyperbolic, but you know what I mean. It's the accent that bothered me at first. I suppose we wouldn't know what Doc Holliday actually sounded like, but it gave off \"The Duke\" (Richard Roxburgh) in Moulin Rouge! vibes. Kurt Russell as the legendary Wyatt Earp is the draw here and I just cannot get enough of his voice. He's Old West American brawn to the max and when the ass-kicking starts the movie really takes off. *Side Note* Has Sam Elliot aged at all? He looks the same in 1993 as he does in 2018's A Star is Born \u2014 must be mustache magic.",

Bad guys are bad, their motivations are simple, and in most cases, they're just mean with no further explanation necessary. Earp and Co. have to go up against conflict on two classic fronts - the rootin'-tootin' cowboys and the foppish government system of justice. It's a formula that allows the film to cater to a uniquely American sense of a heroic figure, the independently-minded and hyper-capable individual that manages to walk the line between flipping off the establishment and preserving the public good. This movie is positively stellar in its casting, with Russell and Elliott bringing their respective mustachioed swagger, but ultimately playing second fiddle to a note-perfect Val Kilmer, who peppers the runtime with so many jeweled one-liners that he has become the unofficial star of the film in the years since Tombstone's release. It's a well-known (semi-)historical narrative, and doesn't bend any rules of the genre, but instead caters to its strengths. (4/5)",

There are far more that just haven't done it for me, and I can't pinpoint what exactly it is that doesn't do it for me. \n\nI think Tombstone gave me something that a lot of westerns don't with its stellar cast and excellent production value. It seemed far more violent than the standard western I'm used to watching. I'm going to credit that to the fact that it's just a more modern take though. It felt at times that they tried to tell too much of a story in too short of a film (not that it needed to be longer, but maybe cut out some of the extra filler). \n\nIt has so much energy, and felt as though I was truly there, part of that had to be thanks to the portrayal of Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell) and Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer). The on screen duo lit up every scene they were in and made the entire experience different from what I had experienced before.

I personally really like Doc Holliday  mainly because of how is character is played out.\n\nThe cinematography is very good with some great shots here and there. \n\nThe setting with Tombstone in my opinion was very good from the way the town is to the way that the characters are in the town.\n\nThe set design and props are down to the point fitting the era really well.\n\nThe costume design in my opinion works really well with the characters and also fits the era really nicely.\n\nThe film has a very good style from the colour design to the cinematography.\n\nThe practical effects are also very well down from the shooting to the way the blood looks.\n\nThe film also has some very vibrant and fast paced action which is also directed really well.\n\nThe film also has some good and steady dialogue with a couple of quotable lines. \n\nThe film has a very steady soundtrack that fits very nicely in the background of the film.\n\nThe story is based off true life events following Wyatt Earp and his brothers leaving there gun slinger ways to make money in the town of Tombstone, but they werent expecting to run into the Cowboys.\n\nThe film also has some very good comedy especially from Doc Holliday.\n\nThe film at points also has some very good atmosphere especially toward the end.\n\nThe film also has some emotional scenes that can bring a tear to the eye.\n\nI also personally really enjoy watching the film but I can see some people who could get a little bored. \n\nThe film does have a couple things wrong with it though like a couple shots were they use slow-mo which in my opinion doesnt work with the rest of the film.\n\nOver all I give it a 8/10 - worth paying for two tickets",

            "content": "Tombstone is the coolest Western ever.\n\nTombstone (1993) brings creative shots from director George P. Cosmatos to tell a riveting Western story of law and order. Tombstone forces us to confront the truth that some men are so evil that they deserve to be gunned down. Likewise, Tombstone offers up a triumphant and inspiring vision of lawmen brave enough, skilled enough, and virtuous enough to do the right thing and stand up for society.\n\nKurt Russell is brilliant, in perhaps his finest role, as the legendary lawman Wyatt Earp seeking retirement and peace. Russell commands each scene and breaths each line to life with a manly confidence and undeniable power. Russell's presence is palpable as all of Tombstone's energy and magnificence starts with him. Russell plays Earp with a respectful sternness and resolute morality. He only draws his gun finally for the right cause. My god, when Russell starts killing, Tombstone's exhilarating gunfights are the stuff of cinematic legend themselves. Tombstone is truly remarkable for making the hail of bullets carry weight with consequence and purpose with each shot.\n\nSimilarly, Val Kilmer delivers his finest acting in Tombstone as the hilarious quick witted Doc Holliday. Kilmer gives a cool edge to Holliday that is unforgettable. His smooth delivery and frail visage is an intriguing pairing. Kilmer's devotion to maintaining Earp and Holliday's friendship is admirable. His gunplay is astonishing, but Kilmer's dramatic moments as Holliday are moving as well.\n\nTombstone's supporting cast is one of film's all time greats. Sam Elliott is fascinating as the stout and moral Virgil Earp. Bill Paxton is likable and endearing as Morgan Earp. Michael Biehn is terrifying as the quick draw cowboy Johnny Ringo. Powers Boothe is hilarious and fun as the sleazy killer Curly Bill. Stephen Lang is despicable as the cowardly murderer Ike Clanton. Thomas Haden Church is intimidating as Billy Clanton.\n\nThen, Dana Delany is mesmerizing as Josephine. Jason Priestley is really excellent as Billy. Joanna Pacula is really fun and lecherous as Kate. Dana Wheeler-Nicholson is great as the addicted lush Mattie Earp. Billie Zane is really entertaining as Mr. Fabian. His part during the Faust play is very convincing. Michael Rooker is great as the reformed cowboy Sherman McMasters.\n\nTombstone is so awesome that it even features a host of mind blowing cameos. Charlton Heston is nice as the rancher Henry Hooker. Frank Stallone is good as the outraged poker player near the start Ed Bailey. Billy Bob Thornton is funny as the portly gambler Johnny Tyler.\n\nLastly, Tombstone is cool enough to get Robert Mitchum as the narrator. Mitchum's distinct deep voice booms through the narration lines with ease and emotion not often heard in a narrator.\n\nTombstone is a marvelous film. Stunning mustaches, killer dusters, thrilling combat, hard hitting pistol whipping, fast horse riding, and intense mowing down of human life. Tombstone is as entertaining, fast paced, and interesting as the entire Western genre gets. Do yourself a favor and watch Tombstone immediately!",

It's a bit on the shallow, simplistic side, but machismo levels are off the charts and the strong personalities are endlessly entertaining, bouncing around and ricocheting off one another like careless lead sprayed on a dusty street. Earp gets the marquee treatment, but there's no masking that Holliday is the story's real star. Played with an overdose of charisma by Val Kilmer, Doc is a vastly intriguing character; damaged both mentally and physically, he spends the entire film in some combination of deep intoxication and sweaty near-death, brought on by the later stages of tuberculosis. Doesn't matter. He still gets the best lines, the most memorable scenes and the densest, most complete individual storyline. A staggering, winking car-wreck of a man who's simply impossible to look away from, I'd throw him up against any of cinema's all-time greats. The surrounding film is secondary. We get a heavy dose of gunfights, shady characters and gentlemen who look cool in an absurd mustache and a duster, par for the course given the era and genre. But Doc, man, Doc elevates this film from a stylish also-ran to an absolute classic.",

The drama and tension are drawn up beautifully in a realistic way to the climax, which is actually in the middle of the movie. The technical aspects of the filming were also handled very well. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the protracted ending that drags on after such a dramatic climax. This undoubtedly is an attempt to honor epic western film tradition, but I really prefer the deep, realistic feel of the first half of the film. If you like a thrilling drama built up the right way, a good cast performing at their best with excellent dialogue, immersion into a Western period piece, a good mixture of epic feel mixed with a healthy dose of realism, and gun-slinging violence then I highly recommend this movie.",

You get to like each of the characters, even the bad guys like Johnny Ringo, Curly Bill and especially the loathsome, Ike. The best movies have good guys you like and bad guys that are memorable. I thought the casting and acting was 100% and there are over a dozen characters that play important roles. It is a large cast for a movie.

This particular film was one that I was very interested in seeing because I like the cast.  Aside from Kurt Russell, who I struggle to accept as a period actor, the cast really delivered on what I expected.  Sam Elliott was basically born for Westerns, and I cannot believe how perfect he is for the role.  I also loved watching Val Kilmer's portrayal of the man who tries to remain strong despite his steadily declining health.  The best part of any Western, in my opinion, is when you have a good showdown, and this one gave you several sprinkled throughout the film, which I thought was a nice way of keeping the audience engaged.  In fact, pretty much everything between the Earps and the cowboys was a treat for me to watch.  What drags the movie down is the romance stuff.  I swear the only purpose in having Dana Delany in the movie is so they can manufacture a happy ending, and it's a pretty artificial and unconvincing ending, too.  I wanted more time with the Earps and Holliday, perhaps more time with the cowboys as well to establish how evil they could be, but I didn't need a second longer with the pointless damsels in distress.  Tombstone is not a bad movie by any stretch, but it could have been better with a little tweaking of the plot.",

Since it does not alter it's original story for cliched thrills, it provides much much entertainment and quirky twists. Though, I believe that the film could have had a more power packed ending. Other than the lead characters, none of the others in the film have much to do here and all the supporting characters have poor character development, especially the women here.

The weak spot might be the romance subplot (Kurt Russell in general is a little off, but is a contrast to Kilmer so it kind of works). Some of the actors to mention include Sam Elliott as his usual self and never disappoints. Bill Paxton is good as well for what role he was given. Also, a cameo role by a younger fatter Billy Bob Thornton is fun to see.  Although again everyone is outshined by Kilmer as Doc Holiday and Michael Biehn as Ringo - that dueling chemistry on screen is enough to see the film alone. The music is sweeping and cinematic enough, and the set design is top notch. The shots are nice too, complimenting the same style, very Sergio Leone, but in the 90s (meaning more medium shots and medium long shots). The film also touches on some social issues like drinking with men, and opium with women during the hard days of the west to name a few, but that is fine as it is a plot device as well within the story. Unfortunately, saying that points to the main problem, that the plot does feel a little awkward, predicable, and weak at some moments. For example, some of the dialogue can be lame, but if you let yourself just go with it, I think a good time can be had for sure. Mainly because not too many westerns are made anymore, let alone good ones from that era. That said it delivers on all of the great expectations for what it is: An action packed spaghetti western. In modern times comparing it to say Django offers a unique perspective on how this film delivers today. It's not as ambitious as Django, but its a totally different story and team too. From that time compared to say Unforgiven (a realistic western), as far as pure character and story go, its not as good, but in the genre I believe it was meant to be in, it stands as a good film, and a great popcorn movie. If you liked this film, I also recommend another western from that era Quigley Down Under, it is less serious like Django, (although Django is very serious sometimes), but still spaghetti with meatballs. I rate this 4 stars because of movies like, The Quick and The Dead!  Short Review by Movie-Mike",

            "content": "Tombstone is a fairly entertaining ride and a good Western film, but not my favorite.  To be honest I'm not big on Westerns.  It's just not a genre I'm very into.  However, I'm not going to be biased and judge the film on whether it's actually good or not and whether I had a good time overall.  I know this is based off real events and the characters in this were real people but I won't judge on how accurate this film is because I don't know the real story very well.  I will say the film definitely good and I got some entertainment but, at the same time, I wouldn't watch this all the time.  One because I don't care for Western that much and, while it fun, it was also boring and poorly paced in places.  It also fakes you out too many times.  There are a few Western I enjoy.\nThe plot is as follows.  A man named Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell), a former lawman moves into the city of Tombstone with his two brothers, Virgil (Sam Elliot) and Morgan (Bill Paxton) and their wives to settle down and make their fortune.  They also run into and old friend named Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer).  However, in the Wild West there is little-to-no order.  The sheriffs and lawmen are almost nonexistent.  The cowboys really run the show so it virtually total anarchy.  Wyatt's brother, fed-up with the lawlessness and people living in fear, become lawmen to bring order to an order-less town despite their brother's protest.  They soon realize how difficult that is.  When one of the brothers is killed and another injured Wyatt rejoins the fray, becomes a U.S. Marshall, and, with his posy, guns down every cowboy they can find. \nThe film looks good and the fight scenes are quite entertaining.  You have an amazing cast.  You have Kurt Russell, Bill Paxton, Sam Elliot, Val Kilmer, Powers Boothe, Billy Zane, Michael Biehn, and the list goes on.  I think everyone in the cast does a great job acting-wise.  I like all the main characters and though they were all memorable and badass especially Wyatt and Doc.  I loved Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp but the one who stole the show for me was Doc Holliday.  I'm not too familiar with Val Kilmer.  I'm not a big fan of Batman Forever and I haven't seen anything else he's been in other than this film.  I though he did an amazing job in this film and Doc is the definition of badass.  Powers Boothe and Michael Biehn do good as the villains though they're not given much to do which I'll get to.\nThere are a few things I didn't care for.  This film does seem like a bit of a romanticized version of the Wild West.  It looked nice but a little too nice.  It looked too fancy for the Old West to me but maybe I'm wrong.  I wasn't in the Old West so what do I know?  There are conflicting tones in this film.  It tries to play itself very series and dark in places yet it goes very over-the-top action movie in others.  For example, there is a shoot-out near the end where Wyatt snaps and kills everyone.  That scene is so goofy that it took me out a bit.  I don't know if that was intended or if it was just the execution.  The villains are all comical too despite good performances by the actors.  \nThe pacing is to too draggy as well.  While it definitely had its entertaining moments it also had its slow and boring moments especially at the beginning.  The film is 2hrs. 10 min. and it feels like it if not longer.  There are like three or four seemingly final fights.  You have the fight in town against the cowboys.  You would think that that would be the big final fight but the film keeps going.  Then you have the big shoot-out between Wyatt and Powers Boothe's character's groups but the film keeps going.  There are two more seemingly final confrontations after that.  It didn't seem like the film knew when to end.  However, most of the fights were enjoyable.    \nThe villains are nothing.  The actors and their performances make them a bit more worthwhile but ultimately they're forgettable.  The villains are built-up throughout the entire picture, but, at the end of the day, they just couldn't compete at all.  They aren't, at all, interesting either. \nOverall, Tombstone is a good movie.  Half of my complaints are really minor grips.  My lack of enjoyment in some areas could be due to the fact that I'm not a big fan of this genre of film anyway.  If you like Westerns then you should definitely watch this film if you haven't already.",

            "content": "Tombstone takes a different approach to its character drama than more stereotypical westerns do because of how it uses a musical score to enhance the drama in the scenes that follow such dramatics. Although this is an achievement, too many of the negative elements seated in Kevin Jarre's script remain dormant in Tombstone, predominantly the length of the script and excessive subplots which end up giving Tombstone a rather boring first hour to work with which is burdened by too much talking and not enough serious western drama when it was advertised as an action-adventure western, which makes it misleading. Although the first hour has all the film's technical benefits and talented actors, it's just boring and slow. Even though it's traditional for western films to be slow, Tombstone is slower than average but advertised otherwise which is troubling for the viewer, and much of it is mere melodrama.\nAlso, the musical score, although very well composed seems to be misplaced in a western-crime hybrid like Tombstone because it's more appropriately fitting to a Disney adventure movie due to its melodramatic nature, mixed with its light tone and brief movements of heaviness. It sounds weird, but keep your ears open watching Tombstone and you'll see what I mean.\nThings turn around as the film enters its second half because the pacing between the drama and action is more balanced and the scenes tie together better, which makes it function at a more entertaining rate. But after a slow first hour, this more-or-less splits Tombstone into two films, with the former film being a slow and boring drama focused on character building and the latter being a brutal western drama with some visually impressive action. Lastly, much of the time Tombstone can't decide between being a crime drama or a western, but only succeeds in blending particular elements of them together while coming up short in other areas. \nReally, a lot of the troubles with Tombstone can be attributed to Kevin Jarre whose poor story writing and scripting \"skills\" didn't give Tombstone such a strong setup and left it to everyone else to fix. Luckily enough they did, and even more luckily Kevin Jarre didn't end up directing Tombstone, because had he done that then there isn't much to say that Tombstone would have been better than Kevin Costner's competing western flop from the same year, Wyatt Earp. Luckily Tombstone had, among other things, a very talented cast to hold it up.\n\nKurt Russell is exceptional in Tombstone. He's not just incredibly strong at articulating his characters emotions for the dramatic scenes, but he's incredibly intimidating too. Even though some of his lines a poorly written, he uses a natural skill as a heroic actor to spearhead the role of Wyatt Earp and ensure that he transcends the norms of a cowboy to make himself a lawman, and an actor as talented as Kurt Russell cannot and does not fail at that. He does an excellent job, and one of his most heroic next to his iconic Snake Plissken. \nVal Kilmer continues to impress me, because in Tombstone he makes use of a stare, a particular stare that looks into the soul of the viewer and says \"don't piss Wyatt Earp off\" and convinces us that he truly is Wyatt Earp. Tombstone serves as a front for him to make use of his greatest skills as an actor again, and it proves to be one of the finest benefits of Tombstone. He is solid and powerful in Tombstone.\nSam Elliot was also awesome because he has a western warrior persona to him which he plays to the benefit of Tombstone in a really powerful manner and creates a strong character from Virgil Earp.\nBill m Paxton, Michael Biehn and Billy Zane were also good, and essentially the entire ensemble cast was a good decision.\nAnd the production design, costume, cinematography and film editing on Tombstone are all astounding and very convincing in setting the mood of the story and the time it comes from, and it just adds to the visual credibility of the movie, as does the awesome shootout scenes which feature a combination of all the films technical achievements as well as proper sound effects and editing as well as a a sense of real intensity.\n\nSo overall, Tombstone is lacking in pacing as the main problem, but the cast and cinematography is too good to ignore.",

            "content": "Directed by George P. Cosmatos (Escape to Athena (1979), Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985) and Cobra (1986)), this western tells one tale in the life of Wyatt Earp, unlike Lawrence Kasdan's Wyatt Earp (1994), which told his whole life story, this is a focused western with a massive cast, and this focuses on the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, which was a footnote in the Kasdan film, but this is more to the point and a slightly better film as well. Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell) and his brothers Virgil (Sam Elliott) and Morgan (Bill Paxton) move to the Arizona town of Tombstone to settle down and live out their lives, it's here where they meet Wyatt's old friend Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer), who has also moved to the town, as the climate is good for his TB. In Tombstone, Wyatt becomes attracted to Josephine Marcus (Dana Delany), even though he's already married to Mattie Blaylock (Dana Wheeler-Nicholson), but the Earps and Holliday find a threat in Tombstone in the form of \"Curly Bill\" Brocius (Powers Boothe), who has a gang of outlaws known as The Cowboys. Even though Earp has retired as a lawman, he's soon called back into the fold one more time to help protect Tombstone from these murderous thugs. There has been a lot of debate as to who directed what in this film, (Russell claimed he ghost-directed the film), but it doesn't matter, as this is a very well made western, with a brilliant supporting cast including Stephen Lang, Michael Biehn, Billy Bob Thornton, Thomas Haden Church, Billy Zane and Charlton Heston. It's well worth a look, especially now as the western is back in vogue again.",

Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer deliver the best performances here along with Powers Booth and they all bring something worthwhile to the screen. Tombstone is far from the old Sergio Leone Westerns, which were epic in scope and storytelling. This is a movie that tends to be more action oriented than give the viewer a straight forward well layered plot that you can really get into. It's not a bad thing, but it does make you want more out of this movie. Overall this is a good movie, but one that does fall short of many other Westerns that we've seen before. Luckily Director George P. Cosmatos keeps the action thrilling and interesting and you are well entertained for its two hour run time. If you love the genre, Tombstone is worth checking out, but be warned, it is far from the classic Westerns, and it does lack the effective storytelling and immaculate performances that have made the old school Westerns such a treat to watch. However for a straight forward Western action film, Tombstone delivers good action and is a fun movie, but it does leave a lot to be desired. It is not the movie that could have been, and it could have been improved upon. With a good cast of talented actors, Tombstone is a fun popcorn film, but it doesn't rank up there with the best Westerns movies either. There are still enough gun fights in the film to entertain the most devoted fan of the genre. Tombstone for all its faults is a fun ride.",

            "content": "Tombstone is once again a retelling by Hollywood of the legendary Wyatt Earp, this time with great production values and well known actors, including Kurt Russel and Val Kilmer. It's a colorful, exciting, and highly-stylized western that's a lot of fun, but it's also very flawed.  It often slips into melodrama, and it really does feel like a Hollywood movie,   which is a shame considering the events this movie highlights are really something to be told. At a run time of about two hours, it feels bloated, and there are lots of notable flaws. However, Tombstone is nonetheless worth a watch, especially with big names such as Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer. \n\nTombstone is about Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell) who decides to retire from law enforcement and moves to the growing town known as Tombstone, Arizona, intending to make a living there with a normal life. Along the way, he reunites with his brothers, Virgil (Sam Elliott) and Morgan (Bill Paxton), as well as his friend, Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer). They learn that a group of outlaws known as the \"Cowboys\" are terrorizing the citizens of Tombstone, and now, instead of Wyatt Earp residing in the town with his love interest and living normally, he is caught up in a conflict with the outlaws. The acting for the whole cast is pretty good, but the two actors that caught my eye right from when they were introduced was Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer as Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday. They carried the movie for me, and without them, this movie probably would've been significantly worse. Kurt Russell is a really likable actor here, and has lots of great development as a character, but Val Kilmer is even better, stealing the show in every scene he's in. He's brilliant in his role and it's a shame that his performance here is not as recognized. He was legendary and he really should've won an Oscar for his performance, but he was overlooked completely. Although there's this really unintentionally funny and over the top scene where Kurt screams \"Noooo!\", but he and Val really carry this film on their shoulders.\n\nThe action is really well filmed and entertaining, as well as being pretty violent, but it's nothing too bad. I would have preferred that the O.K. Corral shoot-out was at the end instead of being replaced by something else, but both sequences were well made. You can tell that the production values of this film were big, with the cast having really over the top facial hair, and the set design looking nice and clean. But that's a problem in its own way, since westerns shouldn't really look \"nice\" and \"clean\", and even the dirt here looks pretty. It's highly-stylized and should look a lot more gritty to really capture what the old west was like, similar to what Leone did with his movies. In Leone's movies, everything looked really dusty and dirty, but here, everything is really bright, pretty, and colorful. Anyways, it's not too bothersome, it's just something I wanted to point out. The cinematography is still gorgeous, and the soundtrack is great, and the film as a whole really feels energetic and lively. When they say Tombstone is a growing town, it really does look vibrant and big. However, the film is a little bloated, and everything is interesting and fun except the bad romantic sub-plot. It's a little ridiculous and melodramatic, and I feel like it was under-developed. You're going to get a lot of characters that are under-developed and have little screen time, so they don't leave as much as of an impact on you. Tombstone also has the tendency to incorporate almost every western movie cliche available, and it often feels like you've seen parts of it many times before. \n\nI feel like Tombstone will appeal more to the modern audience than to the old western audience, and the end result is a little underwhelming and ridiculous at times. It's clearly inaccurate in its portrayal of the events that happened, and lots of this movie was altered for entertainment purposes. However, there's no doubt that it's a very cool western, and the best thing out of this movie was Val Kilmer's legendary performance. His performance alone drove this film past its flaws, and is among the best performances I've seen in a western, or any film for that matter. If you can look past Tombstone's flaws, you're rewarded with a very entertaining and cool western, and it's nowhere near the best I've seen, but it's still well worth spending your time checking this out. By the way, \"I'm your huckleberry\".",

The director of this film George P. Cosmatos is a one hit wonder.  He made this one great film, but all of his other films were bad.  This film shows that he should have been doing westerns his whole career.  \n\nThe film was a perfect western.  It was really well paced, and it was intense when it had to be.  It had all the characteristics that made old westerns great, and many more modern ones.  The newer westerns are usually better acted and this film was really well acted.  I feel the need to point out the terrific performances from Kurt Russell, and Val Kilmer.  Those two carried the movie for me.  It also had more development.  Not only was there plot development, but also there was character development, and the suspense gradually got greater as the film went on.  They went more into the personal lives of the characters, which modern westerns tend to do.  It had the old western characteristics like all the gunfights, and the fact that it was a gang of bad guys.  SO this film will appeal to lovers of old westerns, and more modern ones.\n\nWhat actually happens is that there is a man named Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell) who decides to retire from law enforcement, and go to the town Tombstone.  He meets up with his old friend Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer) and learns that the town has been taken over by a group called \"The Cowboys.\"  He came to Tombstone to retire and reside with his wife, but now he is caught up in something huge.  It started off slightly slow, but then got really intense, and it was great.\n\nI like my western films to be like this.  Unpredictable, suspenseful, well acted, and well developed.  I am writing a western screenplay, and this is one of the films that inspired me to do it.  Westerns were an acquired taste for me, and I am really growing to love the genre.  This will always be one of my favorites of the genre.  My favorite western films are ones like \"Unforgiven,\" the remake of \"True Grit,\" and this one.  I liked the intensity of this film a lot, and that is what made this film so great.  One of the all time great westerns for sure.",

The costumes, though none had that \"worn\" look, looked real authentic right down to the buttons. Even facial hair on the men looked to be the style worn during the time of the Gunfight at the OK Corral. \r\n\r\nThere are some good performances in this film. Russell does a good job in the feature role, and Kilmer almost steals every scene he is in. If you want somebody in a Western, then you have to go to Elliott. Just about every film I've seen him in, Elliott has appeared in one and basically has made a name for these roles. One actor I suggest you take a look at is the one playing OK Corral survivor Billy Claiborne. Claiborne is played by Wyatt Earp, the fifth cousin of the real man played by Russell. \r\n\r\nMany of the supporting cast does do good performances. But, because a lot of the screenplay was cut, they aren't really developed well. \r\n\r\nThe soundtrack to the film is not really memorable. I can barely remember any music in this film. I do remember mostly instrumentals, but nothing spectacular. \r\n\r\nLike other Westerns, there is violence in this movie. However, it is a bit more graphic than some of the classics with \"The Duke\" John Wayne. When Westerns were the thing in Hollywood, you would get people shot with blood running from the \"wound\" (usually a blood pack hidden in the actor's hand), but in this one the blood comes squirting out. You will also get close-ups of body parts where a bullet hole will appear when they are hit. I clearly remember a close-up of one \"Cowboy\" being shot by \"Wyatt\", and a bullet hole appearing in the dead center of his forehead (without a burst of blood). \r\n\r\nThis movie tries to show us the lives and relationships of the Earps and Holiday. However, no historian knows with 100% certainty anything about these men. Much of what we see is pure speculation on these men. But with the performances of the cast, you can believe that these are how these people actually were. \r\n\r\nThere are many scenes which drag on, but the pace is pretty good for the entire movie. It may not be a movie for everybody, but it's still a good movie and could be a pretty good rental.",

Tombstone is good Western, while it does suffer from having too many characters, it's nonetheless well worth a watch.\r\n\r\nTombstone follows successful lawman's Wyatt Earp who plans to retire anonymously in Tombstone, Arizona, where he's disrupted by the kind of outlaws he was famous for eliminating. At about it two hours and fifteen minutes length there a couple of notable flaws with this western. One mainly being it suffers from having too many characters which means you'll get some characters that don't get enough screen time, development, and death scenes that will little impact due to the lack of screen time some receive. Another issue is the romance is a bit under developed, there was never a solid enough for Wyatt Earp to fall in love with another character and was surprised to see them together by the end of movie. What it does get right pacing, while a little slow in the beginning, but when everything shifts into full motion it get started and the plot will hold attention till the end. The cast here is one of best I've seen in a Western with all the actors giving some of their best performances. Kurt Russell mainly steals the show here, he makes an excellent Wyatt Earp nearly carrying the entire film on his shoulder to good results. Though there is a scene where Kurt Russell shouts \"no\" for some reason and delivers the movie most over the top moment which will probably make the viewer laugh unintentionally. The cinematography is great in creating atmosphere and the terrific score is well worth mentioning as well. Tombstone is also one the most violent Western I've seen since The Wild Bunch, though it never comes close to reaching the triple digit body count as the The Wild Bunch.\r\n\r\nTombstone suffers from having too much characters, but the cast more than makes for it with their memorable performances. Tombstone is might not be as good as some of the other Westerns I've seen, but it's well worth your time to go check it out.",

It was also pretty accurate historically which is another huge bonus. Kurt Russell did a phenomenal job with his performance as Wyatt Earp. I love his opening scene with the guy beating the horse and Wyatt saves the horse. Very funny. Kurt just does such a good job of portraying both Wyatt's heroic,sherrif-like side and his deeply emotional side. He plays both those characteristics of Wyatt flawlessly. And of course who could EVER leave out the TREMENDOUS, OSCAR-WORTHY performance of Val Kilmer?? I was completely,totally mesmerized by his character from the start. His character was just so spirited and independent but loyal to Wyatt. There is NO ONE and I mean NO ONE who could have pulled off Doc Holliday's character better than Val Kilmer. Just the way he TALKS goes to show how TALENTED and focused Val is. He plays all of the serious,dramatic scenes beautifully (i was actually almost crying when Doc died) and his funnier scenes which were SO FUNNY! \"I know...let's have a spelling contest!\" My favorite quote in the whole movie lol! Val really should have got an Oscar for his performance. So yeah great movie...highly recommend it.",

The dialogue is witty, fun, well-written and extremely memorable, leading to some of the best movie-quotes of the 90's. The drama is well-acted and even well-paced.  This is one of the few movies where excellence seems to exude from every aspect of the film's production. There were a few surprisingly glaring mistakes in the actual physical production of the sets in a few shots, but there is never anything that harms or hinders the narrative in any tangible way.\nGive Tombstone a watch. There are very few films that shine as brightly as fiction that's truly compelling, well-made, well-acted and fun.",

A band of outlaws that call themselves The Cowboys led by Curly Bill Brocious (Powers Boothe) and Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn) are causing problems in the region with various acts of random violence, and inevitably come into confrontation with Holliday and the Earps, which leads to the shoot-out at the OK Corral...\n\n\"Tombstone\" was made when Kevin Costner was making his \"Wyatt Earp\" and as far as I remember I only did see Costners version. A more stylistic, serious and slowpaced in depth look on the person Wyatt Earp, while \"Tombstone\" is a much more commercial actionadventure and a bit \"simpler\" take on the legend of Wyatt Earp in my eyes. \"Tombstone\" has a massive ensemble cast and I reckon that really gives life to the story and that lifts the movie as well. Most of the script follows known facts about Earp, but with a few sidesteps as far as I have understood. Kurt Russel is not too bad as Wyatt, but I had trouble accepting his fake handlebar moustache. However, the one who steals the show is Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday. I reckon one of his finest moments. I liked \"Tombstone\" until Earp ends up going on his own hunt for revenge, then the plot became a bit sketchy and a bit too much \"actionstylish\". I reckon \"Tombstone\" is a pretty ok western, but I would not stretch it as far as saying it is up there amongst the great western movies as some people claim.",

His long-time best friend Doc Holliday played by Val Kilmer lives there but unfortunately for them, the town is taken over by a group of brutal outlaws called the Cowboys. When the town marshal is killed by one of them, Wyatt steps in to prevent the lynching and this starts the rivalry between the three brothers and The Cowboys. Virgil then takes over as town marshal and arrests several of the Cowboys causing them to kill both Virgil and Morgan causing their wives to leave Tombstone while Wyatt stays behind with Doc to seek revenge and hunt down every last one of the Cowboys until they meet up with the leader Johnny Ringo played by Michael Biehn who wants Wyatt to duel him. The movie had excellent cinematography that I guess was supposed to be filmed in the 1920s because the movie was supposed to be historical fiction but it was great. The cliche action was great and so was the western score. It wasn't really that bad as I really, really enjoyed it. Tombstone gets a weak 9.45/10.",

In the \"night of the long knives\" when the 30-40 cowboys decide to kill all four fools at night, instead of coming with all their forces they only send a couple of men and only kill the young fool and wound the old fool and Earp survives because he is paid the most in the movie.  Earp then puts together a small, heavily outnumbers posse and instead of the cowboys sticking together they let Earp gun them down in small numbers until the cowboys set a trap and catch the outnumbered Earp in a cross-fire and it is hopeless until Earp leaves cover and instead of just gunning him down the lead cowboy also leaves cover and runs out of ammo and gets killed.  Then if that is not bad enough, outnumbered by 10 to 1, Ringo, who takes over as leader of the Cowboys, asks for a stand-up fight rather than just bringing all his forces to bear and just outright overwhelming Earp and his pitifully small force.

I would go so far to say Kilmer deserved awards nomination for his turn as the good Georgia dentist with a fast draw. Sam Elliott and Bill Paxton are always solid as strong supporting characters and this film was no different.

C'est peut-etre une autre caracteristique strictement generationnelle qui parvient a  lui conserver un reel attrait a  15 ans d'intervalle : la vision megalomane et depourvue de second degre de l'Actionner frique des annees 90, ceux qui recherchaient la sequence mythique a  n'importe quel prix, vous collaient dans les oreilles la bande-son qui vous hanterait les dix annees suivantes et vous transformaient une celebrite locale  (le type en kilt, le Minutemen patriote, le gladiateur,...) en super-heros ultime.

It's tough to make that transition from captivating history lesson to a bunch of historically incaccurate action. I'm kidding, this is a good film. Boy, I'de be worried about getting in trouble for my \"Wyatt Earp\" praise if it wasn't for the fact that among the few people who read my reviews, I'm not likely to find a \"Wyatt Earp\" viewer, since I'm probably the first one since it came out in 1994. Still, it does suffer from cliches, bad dialogue and some overdrawn segments. In spite of this, the film is supported by great production designs, good makeup and a smooth pace. The greatest strengths seem to be the excellent cinematography, some solid performances and solid action sequences.\r\n\r\nOf course, the question on everyone's mind seems to be \"Do I go with this or 'Wyatt Earp'?\" Well, I can certainly see why people like this better than \"Wyatoo...\"Wyeet Ur...Wyatt Art... Man, I can't even type that. Really, it's hard to compare the two films, because this film is almost the polar opposite of \"Wyatt Earp\" in theme, as it has almost completely fictionalized the event of this time period in order to set up a more action-packed environment, where as \"Wyatt Earp\" is a lengthy, fact-based, dramatic study on basically the entire life of Earp. They're very different genres, but if we're deciding on which one is the better film, in general, this film is not as respectable, captivating, fascinating or intellegent, for that matter. I'm sure I'll get some heat for this, but I'm unquestionably going with \"Wyatt Earp\". Of course, if you're not as tolerant about the 3 hour runtime and just want an action-packed fun time, then by all means, check out \"Tombstone\" and while you're at it, go see \"Transformers 3\" and give it a 100%, then figure out how to give a 0% rating just for \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\" before you write an incomprehensible review critisizing it for not having enough gore or nudity. No, this film isn't that stupid, but don't expect to get much depth in the real story.\r\n\r\nReally, I joke about this not being as deep as \"Wyatt Earp\", but this really isn't that sophisticated of a film and I'm not just saying that that's a strike against it because I'm so use to the depth of \"Wyatt\". The action-oriented atmosphere and cliches do take their licks at this as a general film. Still, that's not to say that \"Tombstone\" isn't an entertaining, action-packed thrill ride that's worth experiencing. One more thing: \"What's with all of the moustaches?\" This is the real \"Magnum P. I.\". Oh wait, they didn't have magnums back then. Ah, I don't regret it.",

But where Tombstone fails is it's, sloppy ambiguous writing. The structure towards the end is just a crappy mess, and the ending is tied together horribly. I was liking the film for the most part, until the last ten minutes completely ruined my experience. But I also have to admit that the rest of the film is almost also as poorly structured, and there are a few emotional and narrative hang-ups that are a bit confusing. The only thing that saves this film from being horrendous, is that Val Kilmer's AMAZING performance as Doc Holliday, and all the great one-liners and badass shootouts. Other than that, this film just isn't worth the ride.",

Yeah some of the acting is kind of corny especially by Kurt Russell in some parts especially the famous \"Noooooo!!!\" scene but with those corny moments aside he gave a pretty good performance. The roles played by Val Kilmer and Sam Elliot were to me strong points in the film. Of course Sam Elliot in anything is a plus and this movie is no exception. The action sequences are part of the saving grace of this film as well as the cinemotography but I usual always like Western films cinemotography. Its a good shoot em up western that falters at the end of the film. But overall I would recommend it to people that just want to see a decent shoot em up film with good action.",
