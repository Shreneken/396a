This retains the colorful, imaginative cinematography from the first. the special effects are very well done though some of the final fight between Russel and Pratt can be a bit shotty. The music & acting overall are as good as the first with some really fun characters and a very good villain. The only minor problem is the humor is more prevalent here and they double down on it a lot to mostly positive results. However, sometimes it doesn't work that well and scenes can drag a bit because of it but for the most part 70% of the jokes really work and the rest aren't bad as much just fall flat except for the stupid Pac-Man joke at the end. The pacing is still very good though and the editing is very good although the story in the middle with Rocket and Yondu while important to the plot feels like they focus a bit too long on their story at times. Overall though those minor complaints don't take away from recommending everyone should see this once just like the first. It's a really fun and creative sequel.",

Like what?\n\nGamora do you have any tape?\n\nThe ending was really great and a really big\u00a0CGI\u00a0fest, there was so much happening at once in the big battle, there was a big cinematic moment when they landed on the ground giving us the same group shot like the\u00a0Avengers, When\u00a0Peter\u00a0learned to use his powers I didn't mind the comedy in the effects and sounds but that effect of when\u00a0Ego\u00a0was regenerating, it looked like they rushed with that effects, or maybe they didn't want to make it too real with all its organs.The\u00a0ending\u00a0was extremely climactic and it eneded on such a sad note with\u00a0Yondu's\u00a0funeral. It's funny how this movie is extremely bright and colourful and has so much comedy ended so sadly. \n\nDrax do you have any tape?\n\nThis movie is extremely bright and colourful, it has over the top effects, and it has alot of comes. The\u00a0story\u00a0is very different because even though\u00a0Ego\u00a0is affecting other\u00a0planets, the main battle happened inside an uninhibited\u00a0planet, and it's ending was very big. \nThe\u00a0cinematography\u00a0was absolutely amazing, and the\u00a0score\u00a0was really engaging especially the\u00a0sound\u00a0effects, but was it just me or the score wasn't that amazing for the final battle at the\u00a0end\u00a0and mostly relies on sound effects. \n\nDid you ask Nebula?",

I will tell about a second part of this movie. It'my favourite movie from Marvel universe. Second movie is telling us about Peter Quill and his company's adventures after events in the first part. This time Peter has accidently meeted his real father from other planet. After Ego(Peter's father)  has told to Peter about himself and about his plans, Peter with his friends have understood, that Ego is one of the most danderous of villains in the universe and his plans  can have terrible consequences for universe. The Guardians of galaxy vol.2 is very realistic Thanks to technologies, which Marvel studios used. Other stars, planets, aliens and starships is fancy and look as if they were real. Also the movie has a very good humor which can understand Both an adult and a child. Also in the cast there is of my favourite actors. It's Chris Pratt. I'm really enjoying his character. I really reccomend this movie for all Marvel fans.",

            "content": "Having really enjoyed the first 'Guardians of the Galaxy', which was not quite as good as the hype but still very good, expectations were high for the sequel while being a little worried as to whether it would be as good or disgrace the first.\n\nThe good news is that 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2' does not disgrace the first 'Guardians of the Galaxy' and is actually just as good. Like as was said with 'Guardians of the Galaxy', is it as amazing as the IMDb rating (which is something that really shouldn't be taken to heart and is often blown out of proportion here on IMDb) and ecstatic reviews suggest? To me, not quite. Is 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2' well made and entertaining? Absolutely.\n\nA couple of the gags fall a little flat and the film does drag in the middle act. That's pretty much it for the complaints however.\n\n'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2', reiterating what was said in my review for the first film due to having the same strengths, boasts spectacular special effects, gorgeously psychedelic colours, slick-yet-with-enough-visual-depth cinematography (nothing cartoonish or plastic here) and very colourful and atmospheric sets that more than effectively makes one think they are immersed in this galaxy. Costumes and make-up are also of very good quality. The soundtrack and score is rousing and touchingly nostalgic, really making the toes tap. The action is beautifully edited, choreographed with lots of entertainment value and thrills and is at best exhilarating, there's plenty of it without feeling too much.\n\nJames Gunn directs with style and a sure hand, always seeming as if he knew what tone he was going for and who he was aiming at. Both 'Guardians of the Galaxy' films are far and above anything else he's done and his best overall direction are in them as well. Personally really enjoyed the way that 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2' was written too, most of the jokes are enormously entertaining and the film also has heart.\n\nThe story is mostly energetic and compelling, let down only by some of the middle act. At least however it doesn't have as many random misplaced moments and over sentimentality, even if it's not exactly original (not that that is a desperately bad thing).\n\nCharacters are on the most part incredibly colourful and engaging, with a great chemistry throughout. Peter is a likable lead character, but it's adorable and hilarious Baby Groot, scene-stealing Rocket and touchingly conflicted Yondu steal the show.\n\nOnce again, like in the first film, Chris Pratt is highly charismatic, Zoe Saldana is suitably fiery, Karen Gillan is imposingly formidable, Dave Bautista induces lots of laughs and charm while showing a very intensely played vengeful side and a surprisingly well-cast Vin Diesel does a great job as Baby Groot. Bradley Cooper stands out, being a sheer delight as Rocket. Kurt Russell is an enigmatic presence and Michael Rooker is quite touching as Yondu.\n\nIn conclusion, a lot of fun and very well made, every bit as good as the first, a few flat jokes and draggy middle aside. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

The only weakness lies in an over-saturation of what made the first film so special, which was the subtle humour mixed with classic music. These wonderful elements now are more blatant and over the top.\n\nSaying this though, this is the Marvel sequel we were all waiting for, incorporating unknown characters without brow-beating us about upcoming films in the MCU, potential spin-offs and sequels and just creating more depth in the Guardians universe. I am looking forward to Adam Warlock being featured in the sequel.",

            "content": "This film is definitely a step-up from the first installment as the story is just so much better. James Gunn really poured a lot into this movie which led to such an amazing film. The overall message of the movie is so beautiful and offers so many iconic moments. The film always has something going on and a lot of the story details never get lost in other plots. Some aspects of the film are a tiny bit complicated, but it doesn't hurt the movie all that much. A large reason why this movie feels a lot more whole is that the characters are way better developed here. Peter's story excels greatly into something really beautiful. I would even say the same about Yondu as in the first film, Yondu didn't feel all that important. This film, however, made me greatly appreciate Yondu and his actions in the first film. Rocket, Gamora, and Nebula also get some more character development that I think benefited them greatly. Even new characters like Ego and Mantis were very easy to attach some type of connection to as they are both very well developed. The only character I would say is poorly written is Drax, which sucks because I really liked Drax in the first film. Drax came off as rude and annoying for a large part of the film and his jokes weren't all that funny this time around. As much as I loved the characters in this film from a story standpoint, the actors weren't all that great. Both Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana do a poor job in their roles. Their line delivery is off some of the time and I never felt the energy their performances had in the first film. Plus, both actors never convinced me that they had a love connection forming. Another actor that struggled was Dave Bautista. He was sometimes trying too hard to sell his joke or line that it came off in a cringeworthy way. However, the rest of the cast was pretty solid. Bradley Cooper did a fantastic job just like in the first film and new additions to the franchise Kurt Rusell and Pom Klementieff do an awesome job with both really nailing down the personalities of their characters. Michael Rooker is the stand-out to me in this film. Rooker had some great line delivery and really made the message of the film feel powerful and impactful. The production design of this film was flawless. Everything looked so stunning and the design of Ego's planet was just so well done. The color choices were great and how the technology on the planet moved was just so cool to watch. However, the cinematography felt a little weaker in this film. It was still very good, but I don't think cinematographer Henry Braham really made any shots look visually breathtaking like Ben Davis did in the first film.  Something that did improve was the score. It was better than in the first one with Tyler Bates creating some memorable tracks and more of a balance between songs and the score. Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 was definitely a step-up storywise, but somewhat of a step-down when looking at some of the cast. Even though I do like this film better than the first one, I do think the cast was a lot better in the first installment rather than the second. However, the strong, heartfelt story really hides all the casts' flaws and really sets this film over the top. Read more reviews like this at postcreditreviews.com",

            "content": "The first Guardians of the Galaxy was a lot of insanity and a fair amount of heart -- this Sequel has a fair amount of insanity and a lot of heart.  And I really mean it - much of the movie does ask that you feel \"this is funny\" or \"this is cool\", but there are numerous parts where the movie make you feel Mortified, Triumphant or even legitimately Sad.  The final few minutes of the movie before the credits roll are absolutely spellbinding, and I literally tear-up every time I watch the final act of this movie.  The final act is both Inspiring and then Heartbreaking shortly afterwards, and the fact that a Marvel movie has, upon multiple viewings, brought me to tears really shows how outstanding this film is.  Like many, I would've liked a bit more insanity, but this is EASILY the Second Most Insane movie of the MCU (part 1 being the #1 spot), and since the trade-off was genuine emotional impact, I am more than happy with the exchange we got.  If you love movies that cover a wide spectrum of emotions and does so effectively, then Guardians of the Galaxy 2 might be the best movie to do so in a very long time.  You will laugh, you will cheer, your heartrate will occasionally rise and you will end it having had your soul crushed.  In terms of pure entertainment and emotional impact and satisfaction, I'd argue this might be the best Space Opera since The Empire Strikes Back - yes, I really mean that.",

            "content": "GotG Vol. 2 isn't quite as good as its predecessor, but even though it does fall into the \"sequel is worse\" category, it still remains a solid and entertaining MCU blockbuster and comes close enough to the original to be enjoyable. The script doesn't have the finesse of the first movie causing the humor to drag and be a little over the top at points, but the actors do a fine job of getting around this causing a few of these moments to be genuinely funny. It's nice that this movie takes us deeper into the character of Peter Quill by exploring his family, a route that was set up well at the end of Guardians 1. What's even better about this is watching how Peter learning about and discovering his true family impacts his relationship with his \"new\" family: his fellow Guardians. This impact adds some emotional depth to the film, and makes Peter Quill a surprisingly complex character and takes him through a really nice arc that forces him to truly consider his relationships with those he cares about the most. Pratt supplements this with another great performance as the character, and his fellow Guardians castmates hit the spot as well. The movie makes sure to make good use of Kurt Russell as Ego by giving him plenty of screen time, a backstory, and a few emotional moments of his own. It also kicked ass to see the true power and capabilities of Yondu's flying arrow, something we got a taste of in the first movie but was amplified substantially in this movie. It's also still a relief and breath of fresh air that this film has no connection to the Avengers and the rest of the cinematic universe other than us knowing that it's a part of it. As mentioned before, what really prevents this movie from reaching the heights of GotG 1 for me is the humor, since even with the acting the script hampers this movie's ability to be as funny as GotG 1. GotG 2 is nonetheless still a fun and entertaining movie and is sure to leave viewers satisfied as the credits roll.",

            "content": "After the release of Infinity War, I had been bingewatching all the MCU movies to catch up with everyone before Endgame comes. And of course I was watching them all very hurriedly. The memorable movies were the ones that I still remember very clearly to date (it's been nearly 3 years), while the ones that were terrible and a drag to watch, I forgot them instantly. I'd say this movie comes between the two categories, and as far as I can think right now, it's the only one to be in this exceptional category.\n\nNo matter what everyone says, I absolutely hate baby Groot. Cuteness only suits on creatures we are used to perceiving as cute. And thus Groot, a tree, looks very, very awkward with those chubby cheeks. It seems as though that face wasn't meant to be on that body. Also the entire point of his innocence is very irritating, especially the part where he wanted to use Rocket's buttons in spite of him repeatedly telling him not to do it. That scene does not even make any sense, since other than that part Rocket and Groot seem to understand each other literally all the time. Groot becomes stupid or intelligent, strong or weak as the story demands it, which is why I absolutely hate him.\n\nThe visuals are absolutely gorgeous. Though it feels as though there is too much yellow in the colour palette and the overall tone is more inclined towards the warm shades, the CGI world is marvelous to look at. Ego is a great planet to look at. I have seen Ego in the comics now so I can't believe they were actually able to translate him so well on the screen. Seeing the spaceship battles always kept me on the edge of my seat. It's just like how I was expecting the movie to become better as time progresses.\n\nBut the way the conflict between Peter and Ego came was very bad. First of all, the way they bonded was wrong by their characteristics. Peter is a gullible guy who always thinks by his emotions while Gamora is the sensible one. Yet here Peter was the one suspecting Ego while Gamora wanted him to trust Ego. And then the way Ego revealed his mother's death, ugh! Why did he even need to say that! Firstly no matter how much you are in a flow, you'd never say something like that. And secondly if he knows so much about Peter, how did he not know saying that would make him angry?\n\nI really liked Mantis. I never understood why her character arc was about her being ugly. She looked way better than Nebula or Drax. She was kinda cute though. I couldn't hear any of Drax's jokes so I won't be talking about him. Yondu was also a very nice character. As much as I rolled my eyes seeing him in the movie, I really enjoyed seeing what he had become. His character development is fantastic, because of the redeemed person that he is. His whistling and shooting arrows was very much fun to watch.\n\nOverall this movie is a very mixed bag of opinions for me. I think it's really bad compared to the first movie, but at the same time really entertaining compared to most MCU movies. There is so much CGI, so much world building in GotG that I can't possibly hate it. I'm just gonna try to remember this one. I had forgotten everything about it except the good scenes, so I had to watch the Cinemasins video to remember it. I hope Volume 3 surpasses my expectations.",

They are both good in a lot of ways and they both have a lot of flaws in a lot of ways. So let's get the flaws out of the way. For me the problem with this movie is how they handle Drax. For me I feel like they could've developed Drax a tad bit better. He has some really good moments with Mantis, and he can be pretty funny through most of it, but honestly sometimes he can get kinda annoying with his laugh but sometimes the laugh works. Another problem that I have with this movie is that some of it could be cut down just a little bit, and there are a few scenes that kinda feel like they don't have to be there. But otherwise. This movie rocks. I really like the history between Quill and his father. The relationship between Gamora and Nebula was really interesting, and as I said earlier some of the scenes between Drax and Mantis were really good. But by far my favorites scenes to watch are between Rocket and Yandu. These characters were so engaging. Just their history just really interest me and somewhat moved me. They were hands down my favorite parts of watching the film. I also thought Ego was much more of an interesting villain than Ronan. All in all Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is not perfect but still a really good movie. I don't think that I'll ever have a favorite between these but for me I'm kinda leading towards Guardians of the Galaxy but at the end there are stuff that I really like in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 but I guess I'll never know which movie that I prefer. 8.5/10",

Like the its predecessor, this is both funny and surprisingly heartfelt, considering the chaotic world of the Guardians. There is some wonderful character work in this. (The cast is great across the board.) I appreciate how much this feels like a natural extension of the first. So rarely do films and their character arcs have such clear progression.\n\nThere are a couple issues I had. It felt like Drax (Dave Bautista) was dumbed down. Also, I like new character Mantis (Pom Klementieff), but there is the issue of the changes to her character in comparison to the original comics. Writer and director James Gunn has a fondness for making big changes to comic characters. Usually that works. Here, however, here we have a martial artist female hero transformed into a meeker, more reactive-than-proactive character; problematic.\n\nThe whole thing looks great. The first film was distinctive, but this one raises the bar. The sci-fi designs are colorful and creative. The CGI in this is amazing. Really, I think this one of the greatest visual attempts in film. James Gunn's direction and incorporation of classic songs works so well.\n\nOverall, I can't stress how good this is. I highly recommend.",

Drax and Mentis just starting their weird relation.\n\nGamora & Nebula's bonding thickens with fantastic toxic sister-sister relationships were explored. Peters relationship with his Father, being set up as a alien in first movie got good continuity and explains a lot more about Peter getting kidnapped by Ravengers. Peter at last playing ball with his father. Peter taking quick reaction of shooting his father just as he hear about tumor, Peter can't control his emotion.\n\nYondu is the best daddy, his arc and redemption felt so emotional with original Ravengers returning to celebrate that beautiful funeral, heads off to the CGI department.

            "content": "Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 2, directed, once again, by James Gunn, wasn't quite the breath of fresh air the first installment was, but it still packed a nice punch! James Gunn brings back his unorthodox style to this film, not paying off as well as the first, but still stands out as one of the better films of the MCU. I enjoyed Gunn's approach, by making this a grounded, character driven sequel, while also keeping the first addition in continuity, but by doing that, he created one too many subplots, leaving some things a little underdeveloped and choppy. Gunn utilized the same tones as the first film, while also recharging that emotional tone, but he seemed to try to throw in an extra dose of humor, and it threw the tones off in most occasions. One issue this film had that the first film didn't, was it's pace. For almost the entire first act, it was tough to see where things were going; it just felt like another Guardians film. When the second act hits, that's when it slows down, but we get great layers to all of our main characters. When the final act hits, that's where it starts to feel like a Marvel film, having big action sequences, and great chemistry between the characters.\n\nOne of the best things that James Gunn did for this film, was not only flesh out all of the characters, but give them such a grounded tone, being able to mesh with the other Avengers seamlessly. With this film being centered around Chris Pratt as Peter Quill, again, we were able to dig deeper into his back story, and discover a lot of great layers to his character. He had so much to do, carrying the load on his shoulders, leaving him with the best character arch of the film. Zoe Sladana returns as Gamora, and she absolutely kills it this time! With her character being involved with a drastic plot point, it left her character to be fleshed out more, while becoming more grounded than before. Karen Gillan as Nebula got a lot more to do this time around, really giving herself, and Gamora the extra excitement and importance they both needed. We really didn't get too much more on Drax, played by Dave Bautista, but every time that man opens his mouth, it's comedy gold! With the nice addition of Mantis, played by Pom Klementieff, it helped flesh his character out, subtly. Michael Rooker as Yondu, is the MAN! He gets so much more to do this time around, fleshing his character out nicely. His character is just so well written, allowing for great character moments. With Groot being pushed to the side, it allowed for Rocket Racoon, played by Bradley Cooper, to gain a tremendous bond with Yondu. The banter between these two characters was absolutely gut-busting! Rocket also has one of the better character archs of the film, fleshing his character out more, while keeping that charm everyone loves. I'm a fan of Kurt Russell, and I really liked him in the MCU, but the writters didn't give him enough space to breath, and be Kurt Russell. Even though he has one of the best back stories for a villain, while also posing a real threat, his character development was predictable. If James Gunn let him do his thing, I feel as if this film could've benefited from that Kurt Russell charisma. The issue this film had, it tried too incorporate too many villains, making everyone underdeveloped, and a waste of potential.\n\nGuardians 2 didn't rely on the action like the first film, but the few times it's there, it's super exciting, well shot, and backed up with immaculate effects. This is one of the MCU's best looking films.\n\nYou didn't think that they would make a sequel and not absolutely kill it on the soundtrack again, did you? James Gunn and Tyler Bates came together once more to create another amazing soundtrack, that enhanced the emotion and tention in each scene.\n\nOverall, even though James Gunn ran into a few more issues than the first, he still managed to create a real fun experience!",

            "content": "I think this is the most overrated MCU movie. It is a lot like Age of Ultron: a major disappointment after the first movie, which was amazing. The difference is Age of Ultron is underrated with an underrated villain while this movie is overrated with a way overrated villain. One of the big problems with this movie is that the humor failed. It tried to be as funny as the first Guardians but it just wasn't as funny even though there were more jokes, because the humor just didn't work. Mantis and Nebula are bland. Mantis is just a useless character used for exposition and comic relief. Nebula feels like a cheap, knock off, less interesting version of Loki. I don't buy her turn at all. Still, if those were the only issues, I would've still liked this movie. The main issue is the villains. It had too many first of all. We had the Sovereign, Taserface, and Ego. The Sovereign is the main antagonist for the First Act. They shouldn't even be villains as they are actually victims of Rocket's personality. Then, we have Taserface, who is slightly better than the Sovereign, as he actually feels like a villain and his interactions with Rocket are hilarious. And now, the biggest and most overrated villain, Ego. Ego is right up there with Whiplash for wasted potential. He's supposed to be the main villain, but he isn't even a villain for the first one and a half hours (yes, that's actually the exact minute mark that he becomes the villain.) Ego is not built up well at all in the movie. And the twist hardly feels like a twist, as it was kinda obvious he was going to be the villain. If they wanted to do a big twist, it would have worked better if Ego had been evil the whole time, and the twist is that he's Peter's father. They could've made the Sovereign work for Ego, and he's been trying to find Star-Lord, and at the beginning, the Sovereign find Peter and unknown to the Guardians, tell Ego. The theme of family being more than blood would still work. The only reason Ego is not completely boring is that he's played by Kurt Russell. All that being said, the movie does have its redeeming factors. Yondu's arc is really well done. His relationship with Peter is easily the best part of the movie. He has an amazing Mary Poppins moment, and his interactions with Rocket are also really enjoyable. Yondu is probably the one reason that I don't dislike this movie, and think its okay.",

I feel this one is worst than the first sadly. \n\nI felt shocked seeing Yondu killing 100 persons so easily and without regret. He was serial killer and I felt no regret about seeing him for. That moment really lost me. I really wanted to like this movie, but due to that the emotional core failed\ud83d\ude2d.  \n\nPart of the problem is that the Empire Strikes Back, which for all the 80's shameless references. This movie and the previous are afraid to reference Star Wars; which is weird considering the whole Darth Vader is Gamora's father and another sorta Darth Vader is Star Lord's father. I feel they should had stick to one single Darth Vader, if they wanted the movie to be about it they should had done it about Thanos and Gamora, because this feels like a side story that a sequel is damned to sorta remake. Another reason is that well Luke Skywalker love redeemed his father instead of killing him in cold blood; which is what this movie does with Star Lord killing his father in cold blood. You remember that outburst of rage in Return of the Jedi where Luke almost, almost falls to the Dark Side by almost killing his father Darth Vader? Well is exactly what Star Lord does, he literally just kills his father in a heavily emphasized rage outburst (it would had been excusable as self-defense if the characters hadn't been plotting how to kill him like a whole night before).\n\nSure they sorta try to make a point about that rage outburst in Avengers' Infinity War but the point of the matter is that even considering that, like Ironman anger rage outburst; neither of the 2 characters is shown to learn anything. Both live happily ever after without learning anything at all to solve his main internal conflict; because they are never shown solving it. That's what makes George Lucas creation of Luke Skywalker so unique as a character (and yes introducing a parent figure and killing it on the same movie is a huge mistake J.J. Abrams repeated from this movie on a Star Wars movie; even if that movie showed it in self-defense).\n\nI really wasn't fond of baby Groot either, in part due to him being a revived character, and I dunno too cartoonish designed. Sylvester Stallone cameo felt like it had nothing to do with the rest of the movie. In order to not take you out of the movie those people need to have main roles. And yes those Pacman and David Hassselhof jokes in the middle of the end where; well awful. And those godlike powers made it seem even more powerful than Thanos or the Avengers villians up to that point; I hate how Marvel doesn't care about levels of power of villians",

However in doing so, characters like Rocket and Yondu show a more personal side to them which had been hidden away in Volume One. \n\nThis sequels comedy is as good as the first, largely thanks to Dave Bautista's role as Drax, being the main source of comic relief.\n\nWhat lets this sequel down is the story, it is important to establish the true origin of Quill and his father however it just leads to dialogue heavy scenes where not much happens. Most of the characters are at their strongest when they're together so when separated the individual characters just don't attract as much care.\n\nIf the group wasn't split up, this would be on par with its predecessor as the humour is as good as the first, some characters are better this time around, but it doesn't feel like the team up movie fans wanted.",

Absolutely every one of the main characters had me crying out from beneath my 3D glasses throughout. The emotion is rich, relatable and raw and I appreciated it. I mean just the way the movie ends and the interconnectivity of all the plot machinations are warranted and welcome. \nThe effects, battles, and shooting never felt rushed or cheap. Everything fired on all cylinders with a care and love throughout. The plot was personal and minimal as it should be and the way it was made global was sensible and simple. The stakes couldn't have been higher because they were personal and they didn't need a sky portal to do it. \nEven the references I didn't get were welcome little injokes rather than complete set ups for other movies that played in to the tone of the movie. Mantis is excellent and Drax is almost the most hilarious which is saying something. The pacing and the structure of the battles were coherent and made creative use of everyday new skill sets. The film had me in stitches throughout and the potential of Volume 3 and the next iteration of Groot is certainly an appealing one. \nThe depth effects of the 3D, after he litany of terrible post conversions I've seen, was consistent, pleasurable throughout and extraordinary well done and for one actually enhanced the experience.\nThis film should be added to the annals of time as the exact right kind of blockbuster sequel that builds upon its predecessors shoulders to create something unique and memorable that was both economical, brisk and yet deep and seemingly never compromised.",

I still can't help but feel that the film was trying a little too hard to be funny. In the first film, all the jokes seemed more unexpected and timed better, especially with Bautista's character Drax, his jokes were just a little too over done. There was a line said by Star-lord at the end that sums up how I feel in this regard: \"you shouldn't have killed ___ and squished my Walkman\"; the impact of the statement is kind of ruined by the joke. I also felt like the murder spree by the ravagers was a little unnecessary and out of taste. The music choices were ok for this one, I just felt like the soundtrack of the first film was better.

Our newcomers Pom Klementieff and of course Kurt Russell do fantastic in their respective roles, the visuals are great, the music is great, the makeup is great, the direction is great, so what makes this not as good as the original. Well that'd probably be the writing. James Gunn does a great job with character development among other things but the story feels very much like filler and if the film was skipped in the MCU, you wouldn't miss much. However the Guardians like to keep things in their own circle, so it's not the worst, in fact it's very entertaining. Fun movie, with fun characters. That's pretty much it, also Michael Rooker!",

Really everything about the movie is awesome. The one thing I noticed is that Vol.1 has some more darker parts that were left out of Vol. 2. As for letting children see it. I would keep it 13+ The violence is pretty tame and there isn't any nudity or bad language. Some suggestive sexual scenes but nothing too racy. But their are a few deaths that might be tough for young children. One other thing. This movie doesn't seem to add anything to the overall MCU storyline. So you don't need to watch any the other Marvel movies to follow the movie. Highly recommend.",

Now this movie absolutely makes me laugh during sequences and I can appreciate that James Gunn wanted to make a more character based film and Yondu's character in particular benefits from that as he gets a great character arc and some of the best moments. The tone jumps from a cute dancing tree to child torture to Looney Tunes humor to patricide in a heartbeat, and the entire thing kinda has a mean streak running throughout it. There's a whole plot line about Drax insulting the appearance of a sensitive girl while she looks uncomfortable as he does it and there's a main plot line about an orphan who finally meets his biological father only to learn that daddy killed all of his siblings that he didn't know that he had and his mother and then he must kill daddy. That's pretty nasty stuff for a movie that starts with a dancing tree. Because of the delayed ego reveal the movie doesn't really have a compelling conflict for me until late into the second half of the film and because of this for 70% of the movie ego is just delivering exposition, taking naps, and playing catch, and then suddenly he's a psycho that we need to stop in the very end. As much as I wanted to love this film and I really did. It feels a little bit like Gunn's ego got the best of him and he couldn't quite pull together all these planet-sized villains and themes about family.\n",

Michael Rooker perfects his role as Yondu and the Yondu story arch is so great. It brings a ton of emotion to the team. The music is once again great. Some people say that the movie runs, but I have no problem with the run-time and think it runs perfectly. Baby Groot is hilarious and super cute. He helps bond the Guardians together as a family. There are some great CGI shots that are remarkable, but there seems to be too much CGI and that's a knock for me. Other than that, I can't think much of what is bad about the movie.

Fast forward a few years and we are graced with the sequel. Similar to other sequels in the MCU, the director, writers and producers all wanted this to be bigger but not too big that things get bogged down. They sought a story that could take the characters further as a group and also showcase a single character so the story had a focal point. In this case, the movie centers around Peter Quill and his parentage. We already were introduced to Yondu in the first film and how he raised Peter into the man he became. This film took that relationship, added Kurt Russell as Ego and Peter's biological father and gave us a dynamic story about fatherhood and destiny. This film was unnecessarily humorous to the point of detriment. The visuals are spectacular and add gravitas to the scenes. This movie is a must see, not just for those ingrained in the MCU, but even those that just enjoy good movies.

I laughed a lot and made a lot of \"naw\" sounds as well because I just can't with baby Groot, I mean people come on, I'm weak, he's too cute. Do you know who's also pretty cute? Star-Lord. HAAAA. Yup I said it. Chris Pratt is the perfect fit for him. Drax might have been the funniest character this movie if you ask me. I absolutely love him. Put the beautiful and powerful Zoe Saldana as Gamora and Karen Gillan as Nebula next to that and all is well with the world. Also want to bring up Sean Gunn, Michael Rooker, Pom Klementieff and Kurt Russell. This whole cast is just amazing. As I said before all the animation was perfect. The worlds they created were so beautiful but so are all the ships. It's gorgeous, I can't add much more too that really.\n\nI really really recommend this movie and just The Guardians of the Galaxy movies in general. I think these might be my favorite superhero movies. I'm still laughing at the part where Peter is looking for tape. That might be a spoiler but now you can look forward to it.",

Almost Tim Burton like is his world and instead of humanizing the cartoonish element, he speaks through music. And this time, although he stretches a bit much to express the momentum of the scene, there is a beautiful narration involved in these harmony. And yes, it usually does, but here Kurt Russell verbally explains his inspiring revelation- or so he thinks- through a song where he spirals out his plan while wording its lyrics, Brandy (You're a fine girl) is a vital character in the film. James Gunn, the writer-director doesn't have anything new to offer in this chapter, but then come to think of it, neither he did on his previous adventure.\n\nHis world on the other hand, is rich in details as it justifies the genre sci-fi completely, from the way a planet reproduces generations to the rituals these outlaws religiously follow, swooping in each character's perspective- especially Groot's since he doesn't have anything personal going on in this volume- Gunn keeps us engage with bright colors and spectacular visuals that may feel short handed yet are easily negotiable.\n\nThe primary reason, this second expedition fails so poorly is the core introduced character that Russell portrays which is so annoyingly predictable and one dimensional that it sinks even Chris Pratt along with it. And surprisingly the reprising characters have much more luminous to say, Bradley Cooper's character gets more depth and Michael Rooker, a satisfying arc with Dave Bautista sharing few laughs with no one but himself. Pretty much in its early stage, Groot- an innocently motivated adolescent- is staged in a moral dilemma of befriending an enemy to help his friend, this feeling is what's left with you at the end of Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2, we as an audience are compromising.",

As such, no matter the interstellar technobabble or the computer-generated alien monstrosities, the movie at heart is a family drama, forcing Quill to decide between his biological relations and his adopted clan, between an arrested childhood with a long-absent father and assuming the paternal mantle among his (even more juvenile) squad. And in case anyone thought my Lacanian reading of the first film a specious stretch, just consider that the Big Bad here is named Ego---though in truth, he is more akin to a Super-Ego, a villainous match for a burgeoning Superhero. Yet again, unlike the rest of Marvel's pantheon up to this point, for Quill to become a superhero means rejecting his innate character and the consequent power of his patriarchal heritage, rather than embracing the static tautology of becoming who he essentially already was. As his avuncular pseudo-father reminds us, anyone can be a hero, even (perhaps especially) those whose every fiber of their facticity struggles against, rather than for, ordinary righteousness, because it's less a matter of being inherently worthy than acting subjectively worthless, refusing the strength of the [E]go, reaching ego-death even as that means sacrificing the self.",

The story is great fun and there is plenty of action, humor and a little romance thrown in - but what I love most about the movie is that it has so much heart.  I often find I don't enjoy the blockbuster action/adventure films because i usually walk away wishing that half as much effort had been put into the story, the character interactions and the performances as had clearly been put into the CGI, explosions, endless fight sequences, etc. Those kind of things are meaningless to me if the director hasn't taken the time to make me care about the characters. This franchise is so enjoyable for me because it has so much heart and I care deeply about the characters. I think it is truly a shame if James Gunn who vision has made this franchise what it is does not continue with it.  It certainly won't be the same without him. I also would really like it if they kept Baby Groot in his baby form for any and all future movies - I fell in love with him during his little wiggly dance in the opening title sequence and my love for him just grew and grew throughout the film!

Everyones acting especially rocket was great.\n\nThe special effects were brilliant. And the CGI was even better. I like how we got to dive into the story of Yondu and his gang/job. I'm surprised during this origin their were no flashbacks. Should I be disappointed. Very funny, also this doesn't connect to the MCU which i am quite annoyed at.

            "content": "One more movie for the Guardians, the Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2. A very loved movie by the marvel fans. As the first part James Gunn was in charged of the movie, because of this the expectation was very high. Also is very important to say that this is an action and Sci - Fi movie, where all the events are set in the space, very colorful by the way.\n\nBy the other hand is very useful to talk about the actors and actresses in the movie. Chris Pratt, Zoe Salda\u00f1a, Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel and Bradley Cooper are the main actors that played the Guardians of the Galaxy. Chris Pratt is the main actor that have been part of important movies like Jurassic World and Passenger. Chris Pratt plays the main character, Star Lord and Zoe Salda\u00f1a plays also a very important one, Gamora. These are two of the more important characters in the movie.\n\nThe volume 2 of the Guardians of the Galaxy story talks about how Peter Quill and the guardians went to the sovereigns planet, were they are exchanging some important batteries so they can get back to them the sister of Gamora, Nebula. But Rocket stole one battery and the sovereigns try to kill them, and in the persecution they crash in an unknown planet. There they found a person called Ego and his assistant Mantis. He say he is the father of Peter, but Gamora don't believe it. Anyway the guardians spend a long time in Ego's planet. There Peter was passing time with his father and he discover that Ego killed his mother, so he tried to kill him and the guardians get into the fight against Ego finally killing him making his heart explode. It's a quite good plot that finally reveal a very interesting mystery of the movies of the guardians. Also it was a very good twist in the plot making Ego being the one who kill the mother of Star Lord and showing how he reproduce and left some power in every planet to take control of them. \n\nThe cinematography was very good and I like it, but definitely the best thing for me was the soundtrack that have music like from the 80's and I like it a lot. Also the colorful background gives an ownstyle to the movie. The emotional effects were very well done, because in the parts that were made to make people laugh it makes people laugh and the moments made to make people cry it make people cry. The special effects in this movie were very present in the movie because it was set in the space. The only thing I can say about the special effects is that there very good and realistic. Finally for me the best escene is the one where Yondu dies and they make a funeral where the Nova Corps assists and in it the assistant and friend from Yondu cry because of how proud is him about Yondu. I liked a lot the scene because it made me cry and it was something I enjoy seeing Yondu having a respectful death.\n\nIn conclusion the movie was very well done and it have a lot of good resources that make it a very enjoyable movie. In a scale from 1 - 10 I give this movie a 10 because this movie have a very own style and is very well executed. I really think the fans have been very happy because how the movie was and all the good scenes this movie have that make the fans get excited. Finally I think this is a really good movie that everyone should see no matter if you are a superhero movie fan or not, because anyway is a very good movie that is very enjoyable for everyone.\n\nBy Flavio",

I think it's easily the best directed Marvel film and it features in my opinion the most human characters in the MCU.\n\nVol. 2 expands these characters and gives us even more reasons to love each one of our heroes. It's a totally different movie than the first one and it's all the better for it.\n\nWhat I love about this film is first and foremost the characters. Everyone gets his or her moment to shine. And Gunn very wisely decides to focus on them and exploring the events that shaped them into the characters they are now.\n\nThe story here is a little less tight than the original mainly because the plot sort of happens to the characters once Ego shows up. And it isn't until the final act where it really kicks in. This is also something I adore. Gunn structures his story around his characters and that really works for this film.\n\nIt's also extremely funny. Some people have an issue with this saying that the film features to much comedy. I understand where they are coming from but for me it's what makes these characters more human. They make jokes to avoid being hurt and that really resonates with me.\n\nThe action is once again spectacular, and the CGI is mostly great. It all build towards an exciting and emotional climax that managed to make me cry.\n\nI recommend this film to everyone, certainly if you're a fan of the franchise and I hope that Vol. 3 can bring this trilogy to a satisfying conclusion.",

            "content": "Guardians of the Galaxy has always been one of my favorite sub franchises within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Quite possibly, this is due to the focus on spaceships and space battles - I love pulpy science fiction. Besides the fantastical technology, a lot of the fun in softer science fiction is the opportunity to create a really bonkers villain, whether it be a character, like Darth Vader, or an entity, like the Borg. The villain in the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie wasn't particularly interesting, but Volume 2 rectifies this fault. Ego is one of the first good MCU villains. He doesn't give Heath Ledger's Joker a run for his money, but his is charismatic, witty, provides an interesting obstacle for Peter's character to overcome, and has fleshed-out motivations. The movie also has a cool opening sequence, with a battle taking place in the background as Groot dances to music and dodges flying characters. On the subject of music, I really enjoyed the soundtrack, which makes heavy use of popular music from the '80s, although perhaps that's just my personal taste in music speaking. Volume 2 is not without fault, however, nor is it my favorite Marvel movie, although it is near the top of the list. My main criticism of Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2 is that the plot is triggered by Rocket's idiocy. Rocket's decision to steal the Anulax batteries and insult the Sovereign queen to her face are in character, but that doesn't make his behavior less annoying. Indeed, the only one of the Guardians who exhibits maturity is Gamora, although the rest of the group is likeable despite their childishness.",

            "content": "Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 is another entry that keeps the Marvel Cinematic Universe footing up to the top while improving on the first movie in many ways. In Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 takes place after the events of the first film where the titular team are now working together as both heroes and a family, but they end up going on the run from a powerful dictator after Rocket steals a highly important and valuable object from them which forced the heroes to go into hiding until they meet Ego who is revealed as Peter Quill's long lost biological father along with his assistant Mantis. They agree to join Peter's dad but soon learn the true purpose on why he needs their stubborn and part douchebag leader in the first place as they uncover the dark secrets surrounding Peter's true parentage as they must fight back and save Peter from his evil father. Vol.2 is everything how a sequel works in terms of characterization, execution and storytelling because this movie does a good job in exceeding the expectations of the first film while also expanding on it. What made Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 great is that this movie retains the best elements that made the original a big hit for the Marvel Cinematic Universe while also being able to stand on its own in an impressive way, everything about this sequel is packed to the brim with new ideas that fits the overall tone of the film at the heart and soul of its story and characters. The things that satisfied me in the movie is the titular heroes themselves, if in the original Guardians Of The Galaxy they were these delinquents who are troubled but understanding from inside, despite how annoying they were when introduced first time around. The sequel changes their personality that marks as a major improvement in the first film's faults of its titular heroes especially Peter Quill, the man who became the dumbest hero in Avengers Infinity War and is responsible for making Thanos gain the upper hand against the Avengers when he beats the hell out of him after learning of his girlfriend's murder at the hands of her cruel adopted daddy and enemy Thanos. Here he was quite different from the first Guardians Of The Galaxy and in the aforementioned Avengers Infinity War despite still having some of his negative aspects that made all the fans hate him in the first place, this is the Peter Quill we love and could have been handled properly before the two part Avengers films. The other highlights of Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 is the funky soundtrack and this time it is filled with songs that my parents love when they were my age, which adds up the fun. The colors are crazy fun and beautiful, there are so many action scenes that are full of jolts and suspense but watchable (The opening fight against a big octopus like alien, Rocket's ambush against the Ravagers, Yondu's whistling arrow massacre while escaping with Rocket and Baby Groot, Nebula vs Gamora and the fight between Peter and his evil biological father). Plus the CGI effects are wackier and just as gorgeous as the colors. There are a couple of scenes and gags that will both make you laugh and cry respectively (The hilarious space jumps with Yondu, Rocket, Baby Groot and Yondu's associate making Snapchat like faces, mocking Taserface for fun and the super sad death of Peter Quill's adopted but true father Yondu). But what made this movie different to the first Guardians film is the big twists and turns which are so dark yet unexpected (Ego revealing to Peter what he truly did to his mother) and last but not least, as of what I said in my previous Phase Three Marvel films reviews is the main antagonist. Ego is another one of Marvel's greatest villains and their most threatening one since Thanos and Hela from Avengers Infinity War and Thor Ragnarok respectively. The new enemy of the Guardians in this film is darker and also a big surprise to our heroes which is done in a proper way thanks to how Ego's motivations were so written well that ties up altogether Peter's family life, its great to see how Marvel is following the pattern on how to make their villains work whereas last time they were unfocused in the early films before they got it in the right direction through the response of fans and critics. Now the acting is superb as always, its good to see our returning heroes reprise their roles from the previous film (Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel as Star Lord, Gamora, Drax, Rocket and Baby Groot respectively) especially the returning supporting casts like Karen Gillan as Gamora's vengeful sister Nebula. While I love seeing fresh new faces in this film like Pom Klementiff as Mantis and Sylvester Stallone as Yondu's boss including a brief cameo of Michelle Yeoh as a former friend of Yondu. But the one who steals the show the most is Michael Rooker and Kurt Russell as Dad number 1 and 2. I love how actor Michael Rooker made some improvisations with not only his acting but his character too that fits the arc of for the team especially when his chemistry with Rocket is fun and also heartbreaking. While Kurt Russell has wore big shoes for his performance as Ego The Living Planet and I love how he portrays the main villain in a surprising way from beginning to end. Director and Writer James Gunn did a fantastic job with his work on this film, he really improved nearly everything from the first film by incorporating new ideas while stuffing it with some of the same old beats of its predecessor which created a fresh and respectable but better follow-up and I love how he managed it well while maintaining its magic touch at the same time, I look forward to see how he will end the story in Guardians Of  The Galaxy Volume 3 in a satisfying way. Overall Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 is a jam packed, fun and worthy sequel that improves on its predecessor in a satisfying but believable way. This movie gets a 10.7/10.",

Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana and Bradley Cooper are all great. However, this time around, its Dave Bautista as Drax and Michael Rooker as Yondu that steal the show. This all-star cast manages to deliver a hilarious and, surprisingly, emotional movie. However, Gunn doesn't quite recapture the same refreshing and energetic feeling that the first film had, which perfectly melded together humour and touching moments. Here, the emotional scenes are often a drag on the film, quite often dull. As said, the film is also far more inconsequential than one would have thought. Overall, Guardians II is a solid entry into the MCU effectively utilising its cast and humour, although its miles better than Marvel's worst (Thor: The Dark World and the Incredible Hulk), it dangerously as inconsequential and forgettable as them.",

In this PG-13-rated sci-fi actioner, the Guardians (Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, et al) must fight to keep their newfound family together as they unravel the mystery of Peter Quill's true parentage.\n\nOf course, expecting Vol. 2 to surpass the out-and-out awesomeness of the original simply asks too much of a follow-up. Guardians of the Galaxy ranks as one of the top comic book movies of all time, on par with Superman and The Dark Knight. Moviegoers are right to assume that the sequel abides by the laws of the Andrea True Connection. In regards to set pieces, comic situations, and screentime spent on each character, it's a case of more, more, more. Not all of it melds together in the fantastic way of the first go-round, however, because more plotpoints equal sprawl. It's not confusing, mind you--just busy and overlong at the expense of the overall joyride. What the movie gets more right than wrong is in furthering the Guardians' development as a family, showing that all familial units experience peaks and valleys. Returning players get fleshed out more, new players get added into the mix, and the dynamic between them all becomes the fulcrum. \n\nA huge gamble in that they weren't members of the Avengers or Spider-Man, the first Guardians thrived by spotlighting the largely unknown - yet fully formed - characters and their interaction with one another. Casting played a key role in this, getting everything letter perfect down to Vin Diesel's different inflections for his character's only - though oft repeated - line, \"I am Groot.\" Here, their camaraderie is on fine display again, as is that of the influx of newbies (Kurt Russell, Pom Klementieff, and Sylvester Stallone among them). Everybody's role gets beefed up, which beefs up the overall story. Vol. 2 is only 11 minutes longer than its predecessor, but it feels lengthier because of all of the padding caused by the numerous threads. Though they pull from the comic books as source material to a large degree, James Gunn and Nicole Perlman's script for the first flick has a monumental task in setting up this interstellar world and, yet, brilliantly feels like a amusement park ride as it does exactly that. The second finds Gunn, who returns as director as well, working solo. The heavy lifting of setting up the Guardians is done but, on the other hand, there's heavier lifting yet in following up such par excellence. This is not to say that he fails. In fact, much of Vol. 2 absolutely soars and the movie as-a-whole succeeds for the most part. It just suffers a bit of a Thanksgiving effect. The pants feel a bit tight after such a varied and filing meal that sets you up for another round. \n\nTo Sum It All Up: Space Jam-Packed",

Ayesha hires Yondu Udonta (Michael Rooker) and his crew, who have been exiled from the greater Ravager community for child trafficking, to recapture the Guardians. They capture Rocket, but when Yondu hesitates to turn over Quill, whom he raised, his lieutenant Taserface leads a mutiny with help from Nebula. Taserface imprisons Rocket and Yondu aboard the latter's ship and executes his loyalists by releasing them into space. Nebula leaves to find and kill Gamora, whom she blames for the torture inflicted on her by their father, Thanos. While imprisoned, Rocket and Yondu bond. Groot and Kraglin, a remaining Yondu loyalist, free Rocket and Yondu, and they destroy the ship and its crew as they escape, though not before Taserface warns the Sovereign. Ego, a god-like Celestial that manipulated the matter around its consciousness to form this \"home\" planet, explains that it projected a humanoid guise to travel the universe and discover a purpose, eventually falling in love with Quill's mother Meredith. Ego hired Yondu to collect the young Quill after Meredith's death, but the boy was never delivered and Ego has been searching for him ever since. He teaches Quill to manipulate Celestial power. Nebula arrives at Ego's planet and tries to kill Gamora, but the pair reach an uneasy alliance when they discover a cavern filled with skeletal remains. Ego reveals to Quill that in his travels, he planted seedlings on thousands of worlds which can terraform them into new extensions of himself, but they can only be activated by the power of two Celestials. To that end, he impregnated countless women and hired Yondu to collect the children, but killed them all when they failed to access the Celestial power. Under Ego's influence, Quill helps him activate the seedlings, which begin to consume every world, but Quill fights back when Ego reveals that he gave Meredith the tumour that killed her due to the distraction she posed...\n\nRotten Tomatoes consensus reads, \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2's action-packed plot, dazzling visuals, and irreverent humor add up to a sequel that's almost as fun-if not quite as thrillingly fresh-as its predecessor.\" Owen Gleiberman of Variety called the film \"an extravagant and witty follow-up, made with the same friendly virtuosic dazzle... and just obligatory enough to be too much of a good thing.\" He cautioned that \"this time you can sense just how hard [Gunn] is working to entertain you. Maybe a little too hard.\" Writing for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers described the film as a \"blast\" and gave it three stars out of four, praising the film for its tone and fun, soundtrack, and characters. He noted that \"Vol. 2 can't match the sneak-attack surprise of its predecessor...[but] the followup, while taking on some CGI bloat and sequel slickness, hasn't lost its love for inspired lunacy. Chicago Sun-Times's Richard Roeper also gave the film three stars, calling it not \"quite as much fun, not quite as clever, not quite as fresh as the original-but it still packs a bright and shiny and sweet punch.\" Roeper continued that \"even with all the silliness and all the snarkiness, the Guardians can put a lump in your throat\", and praised the cast, especially Rooker, with \"one of the best roles in the movie\". In his review for RogerEbert.com, Brian Tallerico gave the film three stars out of four, describing it as \"a thoroughly enjoyable summer blockbuster\" that does not take itself seriously, avoiding \"many of the flaws of the first movie, and [doing] several things notably better. It's fun, clever and a great kick-off to the summer movie season.\" Also giving the film three out of four stars, Sara Stewart at the New York Post felt the film was overstuffed, but that Gunn's \"lighthearted approach makes this matter surprisingly little\" and \"at least it's stuffed with good cheer\". Praising the tone and 1980s references that gave the film a sense fun, Stewart called Vol. 2 an \"antidote to somber superheroes\". At The Washington Post, Michael O'Sullivan gave the film four stars, praising it as being \"funnier, nuttier, and more touching\" than the first film. O'Sullivan felt it avoided usual sequel problems by building on the original film rather than repeating it, and also noted the use of music as well as \"dazzling\" visuals throughout, describing the film as \"a toe-tapping, eye-popping indication that summer is here, and that it might not be so bad after all.\" Brian Lowry, writing for CNN.com, criticized the middle portion of the film and its villain, but felt the film fared better than other Marvel sequels with its strong beginning and end, and \"good-natured energy\", saying it \"ultimately shares just enough with its central quintet-rather heroically getting the job done, even if the trip from here to there can be a bit disjointed and messy.\" For The Atlantic, Christopher Orr felt the film did not live up to the original, particularly due to its heavier themes and feeling that Russell was \"badly miscast\", but the rest of the cast, soundtrack, and humor were enough for him to give an overall positive review. At The Hollywood Reporter, Todd McCarthy said \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 plays like a second ride on a roller-coaster that was a real kick the first time around but feels very been-there/done-that now.\" Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times was positive of the film's soundtrack and cast, especially Russell, but felt Gunn was trying too hard to re-capture the magic of the first film, and the increased scope of effects and action becomes weary. Turan concluded, \"There are enough reminders of the first Guardians to make the sequel an acceptable experience, [but it's] less like itself and more like a standard Marvel production.\" Manohla Dargis at The New York Times said the film \"certainly has its attractions, but most of them are visual rather than narrative.\" She also felt Gunn was trying too hard, and found many elements of the sequel to be too serious even with Russell balancing that with a much-needed \"unforced looseness\". Anthony Lane in his review for The New Yorker felt once Ego was introduced, the film began to suffer from \"the curse of the backstory\" and that the \"point that the movie, which has been motoring along nicely, fuelled by silliness and pep, begins to splutter\" was when Ego's desire for larger meaning is revealed. Lane concluded, \"Let's hope that Vol. 3 recaptures the fizz of the original, instead of slumping into the most expensive group-therapy session in the universe.\"\n\n\"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\" is an ok follow up to the first film, but simply not as good as the first one. As many reviewers has written, it\u00b4s quite clear that Gunn has tried to create something \"more\" than the first one, but only ends up in more quite stunning visuals/effects that becomes overbearing, a comedy routine that works ok in some cases and in other not at all and with a story that doesn\u00b4t really excite you to be honest. I do agree as well that Kurt Russell is not really working as Ego. Even the 80's nostalgia references with music etc feels a bit forced now while it worked so well in the first film. Yes, \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\" has it\u00b4s moments for sure. Been a while since I laughed out loud the way I did when seeing it, but the fact remains that this is not as balanced and good as the first one, and hopefully the third one will take us back to the greatness of the first film.",

Peter Quill has been wondering about his parentage for a while now and the answer finally manifests itself to him, but it's not what he expected. Bringing back together the most antic-heroic heroes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, their second galaxy-saving is slightly inferior when compared to the first installment. The cast, led by Chris Pratt, is once again great, all of the characters get a nice amount of development, the action is top-notch, it has a killer soundtrack and the visuals are even more impressive than before. Oh and Baby Groot! But the first half, or maybe act, is rather slow with a bit too many jokes and not all of them necessarily land. But after that, it turns into pure Marvel entertainment and once again delivers the emotional weight and heart that made the first one slightly more special than it already was.

The movie takes the points it feels are the best in it, and stretches them out.\n\nIt's a massive visual spectacle, and it's entertaining. Extremely colourful, sometimes pointlessly so, eventually lessening the power of the colours. If everything's colourful and amazing all the time then it gets old.\n\nThe characters in this movie seem to be all indestructible, with the obvious exception of bad guys. Oh, and the one thing that does seem to hurt anyone is the absolute zero in space. Characters get flung around like ragdolls, get blown up, get hit with massive pieces of metal flying at incredible speed, and they all seem to shrug it off like it's a Man of Steel movie. I just didn't care about anything happening, there was never a sense of danger, no tension.\n\nNow the character centered stuff was one of the better parts of this movie. I don't even want to talk about the plot of this movie. It was completely bland and uninspired, basically only serving as a backdrop for the character development stuff that was happening on screen. While it was serviceable, it was very basic. There was no trust in the viewer to understand things, they even included a character that literally ANNOUNCES WHAT CHARACTERS ARE FEELING. The writing in this movie was some of the bluntest I've ever seen. Character mentions pacman in an earlier scene, so we obviously see pacman later on. Character mentions wishing it got to play ball with a father, ends up doing exactly that later on. No to mention the incredible plot contrivances.\n\nSome of the humor worked, but at other parts the humor felt incredibly forced, with no time for the viewer to take a breather from the jokes and goofs. There were also barely any serious moments that were purely serious, they always had to be followed up by some dumb joke to remind the viewer that this movie is edgy and totally funny!\n\nIt's an incredibly light hearted and basic movie with a giant CGI budget. Very forgettable.",

            "content": "Thinking back on Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, I remember enjoying the movie and I remember having a good time at the cinema. The issue is, I don't remember a lot about the film itself. I could give you a quick rundown of the plot but I don't remember specifics. That led me to the conclusion that this was possibly a good movie, but a forgettable one, so I was interested when watching it again to see if I'd feel the same.\n\nGuardians starts straight off by setting the tone of the movie and the tone that we all enjoyed from the first movie. We see little baby Groot dancing away to music while the other Guardians battle a huge monster in the background. It's a nice way to start the movie and gets you comfortable in your seat. From there though, it gets a little too comfortable.\n\nThis movie was always going to be about Starlord's father and finding out who he is. Although we do meet Ego the living planet, the movie just kind of stalls. The Guardians don't really do a lot except stay in this hotel of sorts. With this happening, the movie begins to really lean in on the comedy, so much so that they may as well be holding 'Laugh' cue cards. It might sound like I'm completely bashing this, but I'm not. Some jokes are funny and there's definitely a lot of enjoyable moments, but there's some that really aren't. You have to feel Drax has went from being this mighty moody warrior to a joke a minute character. Again some work but some just don't and it seems like a massive stall on his character arc.\n\nWhile Starlord is bonding with daddy, we do get a good conflict between Nebula and Gamora. This is a straight continuation from the first movie but it's more fleshed out here and we get a lot of great action set pieces. These occur in the last 30 minutes of the movie which I do think are it's strongest. It becomes intense and it gets emotional, the death of Yondu is something that hits hard and we do lose a great character from this franchise. I'm not even going to repeat his daddy line as no one wants to cry reading a review.\n\nDIAGNOSIS - MINOR SURGERY\n\nThese characters are great and Rocket and Baby Groot are at their best, they just don't seem to do a lot for a big part of this movie. It's great to know more about Starlord's back story but for Vol. 3, let's get them back on a big adventure. Music and visuals are the best they have been though. \n\nMatt",

The performances weren't as genuine as remembered. The story flowed in the same way as #1, but the story did not compel as much. I was really underwhelmed by the new characters, specifically Taserface and Mantis. The ugly antagonist literally had no reason to be included. He didn't help at all, and the jokes Rocket made fell flatter than Flatman from the West Coast Avengers. Chris Pratt had a decently moving performance, as Ego being his father added some emotional weight. Gamora had some intriguing with her sister Nebula, but besides that, both characters were more one-dimensional than in the previous film. Drax was much more happy, likely to lighten the tone, as his more gloomy mood contradicted how the majority of the team carried themselves. Rocket and baby Groot worked together pretty well, as they both worked off of each other. However, the most surprising, and best performance, was Michael Rooker as Yondu. He was utilized as more of a selfish gangster, who disliked Peter Quill. His death was actually heartbreaking. Ego as a villain was weak, and the final duel between father and son was even weaker. 6/10",

            "content": "Given that it's been five months since I reviewed a horror movie, until Mayhem a few days ago at least, it also stands to reason that I have been without my beloved Netflix (and Prime) for that same amount of time.  I have missed goodness knows how many movies, that have probably now been removed from both sites, I've missed the second season of Stranger Things, among other series and you don't know how much that pissed me right off.  Thankfully, however, that has now changed and, at least for the next 2 months, Netflix is now available to me.  Finding a movie to watch was not as overwhelming as I would have anticipated, given the fact that there must have been a bunch of movies added in my absence.  I settled on this fairly quickly.  I knew I wanted something a little lighter for my Netflix \"return\" and I was fixing to settle on the last Pirates of the Caribbean movie.  Why?  I don't really know, the first two sequels of the franchise were bloated and convoluted and kill any real hope I may have had that it would be a fun franchise.  I'm still watching it, but jsut because Javier Bardem is in it.  Jack Sparrow jumped the shark halfway into the second movie.  My decision to watch Pirates was quickly set aside when I saw that this flick was available.  I didn't even have to think twice about it.  If you've followed my reviews, on Flixster/RottenTomatoes at least, then you'd know that I felt the original Guardians was tremendous.  It was fresh, clever and different, at least stylistically speaking, from anything Marvel had ever done at that point.  At the time, and this was prior to Civil War coming out, I felt that it was the best film in the MCU.  You could make the argument it's also one of the best superhero movies of all time.  It's all a moot point, to me at least, since The Dark Knight (in my opinion) is still the best superhero movie I've ever seen.  They're all just fighting for the second spot.  Granted, I have not seen either Logan (which I own on DVD) or Wonder Woman, so I'll have to watch those to make my assessment.  Moving on, and it pains me to say this, but there's no way that this sequel ever comes close to the cleverness, freshness and fun of the original.  It's probably the worst first 'sequel' in the MCU since Iron Man 2.  That's not to say that this movie is not without its merits, because as the rating suggests, I really enjoyed this movie.  But there's no denying that, and maybe this is wrong to assume on my part, that there was some pressure on James Gunn to create a movie that, at the very least, was equal in every way, at least in terms of quality, to the original.  I doubt anybody would have expected him to surpass the original, because that would have been an impossible standard to surpass.  But matching the original is, in theory, achievable.  That goal was not achieved, let me just say that right now.  Taken as a whole, this is a very good movie, but when you're down in the trenches, as they say, there's some really glaring pacing issues.   We'll get to these pacing issues later.  Before we get to that, I want to take some time out to point out how much of a fucking hero Michael Rooker is in this damn movie.  Rooker has always been a tremendous character actor and if you disagree then we're just gonna have to throw down.  Seriously though, he's always been great, but I don't think he's ever been given the chance to truly play a heroic sort of character.  And you might think 'but Yondu is/was a total asshole in the original' and you would be right.  But his redemption in the sequel and his relationship with Peter/Star-Lord makes up the emotional core of the film, like Groot was in the first film.  You'd think that someone who's spent about 99% of his career playing villains might have a difficult time playing a hero, but Rooker is more than up to the task and he knocks it out.  Trust me when I say that his journey toward redemption and realizing the love he had for Star-Lord has the power to make grown men cry.  He's the best part about the movie by a country mile and don't doubt that for one second.  If there's one thing that can be said about this that can't be said for the original is that it explore character dynamics on a deeper level.  It's a more emotionally-driven film than you probably would have ever expected.  Peter's desire to meet and have a father is clearly the driven force for the film, for the most part.  But you also explore Nebula's relationship with Gamora, her sister, and how Thanos' relentlessness drove a wedge between them when the only thing Nebula wanted was a sister.  Rocket's pushing everyone who gets even remotely close to him is also explored through his relationship with Yondu.  Drax is the comedic relief and while there's some of his moments that fall flat on their face, which I blame on the writing being a little more forced, I think that Dave Bautista is pretty damn entertaining in the role.  His comedic timing and deliver is on point.  Mantis is a welcome addition, but they don't really do much with her other than use her for Drax to make fun of, hopefully she's a more prominent player in the sequel.  Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Karen Gillian, Bradley Cooper are all  very good in their roles, but I felt that the supporting characters took the spotlight here over the leads.  And Baby Groot is fucking adorable, but he's clearly there to sell toys, it's as transparent as humanly possible.  But, and this is where the problems are gonna start.  The film sees Star-Lord, Gamora and Drax being taken to Star-Lord's father's home planet.  For, you see, Ego (Star-Lord's father) is a God.  And this is when the film just absolutely slows to a crawl.  When I say slows to a crawl, I mean that quite literally.  While there's a 'B-story', as it were, with Rocket, Yondu and Groot breaking out after most Yondu's Ravager crew (who've been exiled by the larger Ravager community for dealing in child trafficking) betrayed him.  Basically Ego, who's traveled all over the cosmos and impregnated a large number of females from other planets and species, in order to find a worthy successor.  Star-Lord is the only one who has been able to harness that power.  Everyone else, he said, disappointed him.  Which should be interpreted as saying that he murdered them.  Naturally, he doesn't mention this to Peter.  Star-Lord, blinded by the beauty of Ego's planet and the fact that he now has a father in his life, ignores the fact that there's something just off about this planet.  Essentially, Ego wants to shape the universe in his image, which is why he planted some pods, or what the fuck ever, in all the planets he went to, so he could proceed to take over the world by injecting it with his influence.  To do that, he needs another Celestial, which is where Star-Lord comes in.  If this was all there was to it, there would be no problem.  But from the moment that Drax, Gamora, and Peter arrive on Ego's planet, there's a large chunk of the film where it feels like nothing happens and some of its attempts at humor fall flat on their faces.  Like Drax and Mantis making fun and laughing at Star-Lord for having sexual feelings for Gamora.  That scene was cringe-worthy and it felt like they were just desperate for laughs.  There was another scene back with Yondu and Rocket where they tell Baby Groot to fetch Yondu's fin and he brings everything back BUT the fin.  And, again, while it's a fun scene, it still felt like a forced attempt at humor.  I will say that once the reveal that Ego gave Peter's mother the brain cancer that ultimately killed her which, naturally, drives Peter into a rage which causes him to shoot his father (who's immortal until, of course, he isn't).  After this moment, the movie, thankfully, kicks into high gear and the last 45 minutes of the movie are pretty great all things considered.  I just find that spending so much time on Ego's planet really, quite frankly, doing nothing and just sitting still hurt the movie much more than they probably imagined.  I'm surprised no one saw this and went, maybe let's make these sections of the film a little shorter.  But they take up so much time of the film and it just feels like a lot of dead air.  You could have accomplished the same exact thing in half the time.  I don't wanna say it kills the movie, because it doesn't, but it was just the wrong creative choice to stick with this setting while not really accomplishing anything.  I get that you can't rush Ego and Peter's time together, given the fact that this was a big deal to Peter, but, I don't know.  Let's move on.  As I mentioned, the last 45 minutes of the movie are an equal mix of fun, clever and heartbreaking all at the same time.  Let's just say that there's an eulogy that Peter gives for a character that's, actually, legitimately a beautifully done.  It doesn't feel like a forced moment of sentimentality, given everything that went down, the eulogy shouldn't have been done in any other way than what we got.  Going back to the large action scene that climaxes the film, it's actually really damn good.  Perhaps not as memorable as, say, the Battle for New York in the original Avengers.  But the special effects are great, there's some really cool moments involving Pac-Man, you'll know the one.  One of my favorite bits of the entire movie also happens during this scene, where Rocket. who's in a cave of some sort, asks Peter if he has tape while there's a battle going behind him.  Peter says no and he proceeds to ask every member of the Guardians.  This happens all off-camera but you can hear it from Rocket's position.  It's silly, but it works in this universe.  I'm trying to think if there's anything else I have to say about this.  I think this review pretty much covered it all.  On Kurt Russell's performance, I found that he was good, but Ego is another forgettable Marvel villain in a long line of them.  The only one they really have that's any interesting, given that he's a major part of his franchise's story, is Loki.  He's a recurring character in the Thor movies (and the larger MCU as well) so he's instantly more memorable since, sadly, a lot of MCU movies have this 'villain-of-the-week' type thing, where there's a revolving door of villains and none of them really stick or stand out in any way.  Ego, as good as Russell is, is just another one in a long line of them.  That's neither here nor there.  Summarizing my thoughts, this was a wildly inconsistent entry in the MCU.  I'd still say I enjoyed it a lot, but there's no denying that this is a huge step down from the original.  I appreciate the more character-driven and emotional approach the movie took, it allowed you a glimpse at these characters from a different angle.  That was the best thing this movie did.  But the pacing was terrible for the first 90 minutes of the film, the last act was great, it definitely undid some of the damage.  But it didn't do enough to truly make this, in my opinion, a great film.  It's a very good one and I would recommend it to MCU aficionados, but this is neither the best nor the worst entry in this universe.  It's the best at letting Michael Rooker be amazing, that's for sure.  And, to me, that's more than reason enough to recommend this film.",

Drax had his arc last film and in this film serves as a humorous familial anchor for the Guardians - almost like an embarassing mom. Gamora is psuedo team mom but also has her own family dynamic to handle with her sister Nebula which is expanded and examined further as their uprbringing by Thanos isn't just comic booky - it's abuse and it messed the two up. Star Lord and Rocket get the most expansion with Rocket's spitefullness and actions get examined and explored as what they are: emotional responses of fear and disbelief that he can actually make friends and before they (he percieves) will leave him or not befriend him, he sabotages things before hand as a means of control. The center is Star Lord's arc learning to appreciate the family he does have over trying to find a glorified and unrealistic image in his mind of what family is in the form of Ego and how that collides and clashes. Combined with an apt fitting soundtrack of cool songs that also so a stellar job of telling the story - no song is unimportant or picked at random - special effects that make the world and characters visually colorful and vibrant - at least as of 2017 it's the best Marvel Cinematic Universe movie since the last Guardians of the Galaxy.

            "content": "Growing up, I never thought that superhero movies would be such a huge aspect of my life. I am not particularly a huge comic book fangirl, nor even particularly a comic book movie fangirl. And yet I have found myself in the position with many others, where I am seeing nearly three Marvel movies a year. I don't have the energy to open up the discussion on DC today, let's stick with the Feige-verse for now.\n\nI enjoy almost every MCUl movie I see. They know what they are doing, they know they can put out 3 movies, all between B and A-'s, and print money. They have had an absurd record as far as opening weekends go, I am not sure if there has been a Marvel property in recent history that hasn't been objectively a massive success. But the first Guardians of the Galaxy was when it really first kicked in for me. I am a sucker for classic music used in new, fun ways (translation-not Suicide Squad ways) and the cast and plot really just made for my favorite Marvel movie. And since Edgar Wright never got to do Ant Man, the original Guardians remains my favorite. That being said, I was anxious going into the second. The first won me over by surprise, and I knew that my expectations for the second would only leave me at least a little underwhelmed. And I was terrified they would over use baby Groot. They did, but I digress.\nThat being said, this was a really solid, fun summer blockbuster. I had more complaints about this than in the initial, but this still stands in my top Marvel movies just in story and execution. It feels like a different, more off beat property than The Avengers, which is tiring slowly to me. The Guardians movies just seem to have a more relatable rag tag quality than the very classic superheroes of the rest of the MCU, save for Wolverine. James Gunn also walks the line of \"funny\" and \"real emotions that make you want to cry while listening to Cat Stevens\" better than any other current director in comic book franchises.\n\nIt would be hard to get too into this without getting into spoilers, so let's just talk Kurt Russell. I was not as much of a fan about the plot of the sequel as the first, but Kurt Russell is just the best, so I will forgive the weird father plot line that got really out of hand quickly. This highlights the main issue I have with the MCU. The scale of the conflicts are always way out of proportion. Not every movie has to have the entire fate of the universe on the line. Sometimes there can just be one truly evil person who wants to ruin one to five people's lives, and that can be interesting too.\n\nBut as I said, nothing with 70's Kurt Russell could disappoint me. 7.5/10",

            "content": "Chris Pratt is back! for more alien-action epicness. The overall plot of the film doesn't contribute  a change to the MCU while the overall story depicts Quill's heritage who he thought were gone, the story is somewhat not related to the last prequel, it is more of a spinoff film. We finally got to see Ego(Quill's father) who fans have been waiting for to see, a new character to the franchise, we got to see enough of his origins and his contribution to not only Quill's existence but also to the formation of the universe. Interaction between characters were somehow full of vulgarity and seems like it's intended for cracking jokes and puns, what's weirs is the expression of the vulgarity to the conversation blends in together perfectly, just enough to make a person gag but as long as the vulgar subjects taken too far it drives the chemistry between the characters in an opposite way. Recurrig characters like Yondu and Nebula return but with better character development by finally making a contribution to the plot rather than being unnecessary secondary villains but conversely characters like Rocket had less character development and became a liability to the plot and one of the main causes of the consequences and also characters like Drax adapting the characters of a comic relief character as the source of jokes and puns and became less sensitive about not only in his personality but\n also others' .but he still maintained his physical strength and potential. Characters like Quill, Gamora and Groot were also losing theoir personality but at least they made contributions to the main plot. The best part of the film is that just by speculating the story and plot there are visual morals that can be taken and that is the value of having a family and this was ignited from both deaths of Yondu and Ego, it brings home the feeling of how it felt when you a person lost its family member in real life and depicting those times they feel hopeless when they're not around. I love this film and its values",

            "content": "The fifteen movie in the Marvel cinematic universe, the Guardians travel all over the universe trying to unravel the mystery behind Peter Quill's parentage. That's the plot right there, that's it.\n\nSo the start of this movie shows us the origins of Quill's parents with a de-aged CGI Kurt Russell, something we've seen before and is becoming more popular. Gotta be honest, this looked very impressive. Twas impressive with Michael Douglas in 'Ant-Man' and its impressive here with Russell. From there we zip straight over to the opening credits which roll whilst the Guardians are fighting a big alien monster. Amidst the chaos Groot plays and jigs to 'Mr Blue Sky' by ELO via Star-Lord's walkman. Its a quirky intro and certainly enjoyable...except for the choice of song, but that's just me.\n\nSo as I said the basic plot involves Quill finding his father who turns out to be a God-like celestial called Ego (Kurt Russell). Naturally Ego would like to rule the universe with his son at his side, and Quill is curious, but sharply declines after discovering Ego's dark secrets (he killed Quill's mum). Of course whilst all this is going on the other characters have their own little subplots. Gamora is fighting off her sister Nebula once again. Yondu has been hired to capture the Guardians by the Sovereign race because Rocket nicked some precious batteries from them. This causes Yondu internal conflict which results in a mutiny by some of his men. Groot is still slowly growing up, and Drax starts a slow burning romance with Ego's assistant Mantis (Pom Klementieff). Oh and Rocket is still a wise-ass.\n\nI think the main thing I noticed with this sequel was the increase in comedy...silly comedy. Its a little bit too obvious that Gunn is trying a little bit too hard with the gags, but anyway. In the first major space battle Quill and Rocket are arguing about who is the better pilot. Rocket remarks that later later on he will put a turd in Quill's bed. But not one of his turds, one of Drax's turds. Drax immediately laughs out loud and proclaims 'I have famously large turds'. Its at this point that I asked myself, are they actually throwing out dialog about poo? Putting poo in each others beds...like school kids would say? By jove they are! I also noted a few other scenes that did make me smile such as Drax ripping on Quill's secret crush on Gamora (unceremoniously revealed by Mantis who can read people's feelings).\n\nThere is a great little sequence where Groot must find Yondu's head fin so both he and Rocket can escape from his traitorous men. Groot takes about six attempts to find said item as he doesn't really understand and keeps coming back with all manner of things. A tad predictable but nicely done. Quill calling Rocket a trash panda was a good one although the following dialog was a bit laboured. Rocket trying to explain to Groot about which button (the death button that needed to be covered with tape) to press on the bomb to kill Ego etc...OK lets just say that most of the good stuff comes from Rocket when he verbally clashes with the others.\n\n\nAs for the main crux of the story which was Peter and his father Ego, meh...it was fine but nothing special in my opinion. In all honesty I don't really think they could of done anything drastically original here and what they did was perfectly fine. But the main problem simply was it was all completely predictable fluff that's been done before. Each step of the way, each beat was wholly formulaic frankly. Peter and Ego get along fine at first as Peter wants to learn more out of curiosity. Ego teaches Peter the basics of his God-like powers. As the subplots all start to come together Ego finally reveals what he's been up to (again its no real surprise) and Peter understands what he and the Guardians must do. Then after a long finale battle with the good guys on the brink of losing, unsurprisingly Peter suddenly conquers his own internal God-like powers and uses them to hold off Ego just long enough for the others to do their bit.\n\nThat's not to say there is anything wrong with all this per say, it works here, but I can't not mention how utterly corny and conventional it all is. Again in all honesty I also thought the ending was so so very soppy that it almost spoilt the movie. Sure the Guardians have now become a proper family so to speak (ugh! the whole family thing again?) and all the various plots are tied together nicely, but boy do they pile on the schmaltz. I did also found it quite bizarre how the Sovereign are so obsessed with wanting to kill the Guardians because Rocket stole their batteries, Especially as it looks like we'll be seeing more of the same in the next movie from these guys. Its also kinda funny how the makeup for this alien race consists entirely of gold body paint, literally just painting all the actors gold and that's it. Just seems so...made for TV-ish. Odd for such a big blockbuster.\n\nAnyway, despite this essentially being more of the same from the first movie, I did enjoy this. I personally found the entire movie to be much tighter with better dialog, better action and a better array of characters. Ego being a surprise decent villain...clearly helped along by casting Russell. Also the combination of Drax and Mantis being a decent surprise double act. Whilst both movies do still feel very cliched and unoriginal, borrowing many elements from many sci-fi movies, for me its the quirky roster of heroes that sells the flick. I can't deny that Rocket is fast becoming a firm favourite of mine. Naturally everything looked slick and shiny, plenty of comicbook nods dotted around, and another retro soundtrack which I didn't really like this time truth be told. I actually thought many of the songs were completely out of place with some of the scenes, but that's just me (dunno what the kids think of these old tunes, do they even know what a walkman is?).\n\nYes I found this movie more enjoyable than the first (which I think was somewhat overhyped). Even though they are clearly trying a bit too hard with the goofy comedy and visual retro love letters to the 80's (although I do appreciate the retro goodness), generally I think Gunn and co have perfected this particular team of space cowboys. What they must not do now is push it too far and spoil it. But I will finish by asking, why am I not seeing a (preferably adult) Howard the Duck reboot yet? Surely I can't be the only one who thinks a Rocket and Howard team up needs to happen?",

Batista's Drax and Vin Diesel's Groot are at least intentionally simple, and feels right, but that means there will never be much more to their characters than what's on the surface. Zoe Saldana is forgettable as Gamora in this movie, though I don't know whether it's because she's not that great an actress or the script just doesn't give her much to do this time around. The movie really lives and dies by Pratt's Peter Quill, and he does a fine job here. I almost wish there were fewer characters so it could focus on him a bit more.

James Gunn is really good at furthering character's stories and development in a relevant and meaningful way. The CGI wasn't perfect but not horrible either, it was just a bit distracting sometimes. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a great follow-up to the first Guardians of the Galaxy but doesn't exceed it's predecessor. The score by Tyler Bates is amazing and the 60s, 70s and 80s music choices by James Gunn were excellent, as always. The villain is also excellently developed and played by Kurt Russel, you really understand him and his character.

It is one of my top 10 favorite Marvel and superhero movies of all time, one of my favorite action movies of all time and one of my favorite movies of all time. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is an A+ movie.",

            "content": "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a 2017 Action Adventure Sci-Fi Superhero movie written and directed by James Gunn and stars Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper, Karen Gillan, Michael Rooker, Pom Klementieff, Kurt Russell, Vin Diesel and Sylvester Stallone.\n \nThe movie follows the story of the Guardians as they are hired to a new assignment by a group of golden-colored race known as The Sovereign. When a mischievous act takes place, the Guardians are hunted by the Sovereign which leads the Guardians to escape and meet with Ego (Kurt Russell) who claims to be Starlord's (Chris Pratt) father. The Guardians are split between exploring Peter's lineage and escaping the ravagers, they must learn to work and trust each other to save the galaxy once again.\n \nThe movie is a direct sequel to 2014's Guardians of the Galaxy and takes place 3-months after the events of the first film and is counted as the 15th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Following the same style of humor and action, James Gunn once more presents a fun sci-fi-fi adventure with plenty of action sequences, music and the colorful imagination of Marvel.\n \nThe MVP's of the movie have got to be Drax (Dave Bautista) for his comedic performance as well as Yondu (Michael Rooker) for his emotional and well-rounded character arc. Most rememberable one-lines are given to those two characters that quickly turned into internet memes sensations. What's even more interesting, during the world-building, the focus on the family theme as being the core of the movie adds more value to franchise. The Father-Son relationship of Ego and Starlord, the Sister-Sister relationship of Gamora and Nebula, the Uncle-Nephew relationship of Drax and Baby Groot as well as the Brothers-in-Arms relationship of Yondu and Rocket. \n \nThe main weakness of the movie lies in the plot and overall story as it is clearly noticed that it primarily consists of one joke after the other and not having much development in the overall story. The direction seemed to be rushed to present comedy rather than providing enough time to flesh out more storylines and plots. Another weakness lies in The Sovereign characters which were more of a plot device instead of real villains. \n \nAs the selection of the songs is critical to the overall direction of this franchise, this sequel lacked the charm of the first movie. One wouldn't remember much songs, with exception to Brandy by Looking Glass due to it becoming part of the plot and Mr. Blue Sky by ELO as the film's opening baby Groot sequence are the only two songs that were interesting.\n \nOverall, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, is a fun and exciting sequel with great performances that feels like genuine theme park ride but finds itself lacking to have the same effect as the first movie. \n \n \nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 gets a B-.",

            "content": "After watching an action/adventure movie you expect to have a few thoughts remaining bouncing within your mind. It I natural for this set of memories to encompass such things as a particularly exciting fight sequence or an especially imaginative use of cutting edge special effects. What you don't expect to be infused with an 'ear worm'. Everyone encounters this phenomenon where you hear just a few bars of a song with a catchy tune and lyrics and it remains borrowing into your mind insinuating itself obtrusively into you conscientious. After viewing the film under consideration here I found myself unable to stop the repetitive son, 'Brandy (You're a god girl). The song was a hit back in 1972 rising high on the top forty pop charts, performed by Looking Glass, it was not contained within the set of favorite songs for me, it was on the peripheral of my musical awareness. I hadn't thought about it for several decades until I started watching the second film containing Marvel Cinematic Universe's movie featuring the 'Guardians of the Galaxy'. The leader of this motley cadre of heroes, Peter Quill (Chis Pratt) was abducted by extraterrestrials when he was about 10 years old. This tune, and several others of similar construction, were on his most treasured possession, a Mix Tape prepared by his late mother. It is a simple plot contrivance but the fashion it was deployed pervaded both films with a lighthearted panache that resides at the core of Marvel's incredible success as a box office juggernaut. As part of the amazing blue print for this innovative implementation of a multi-film franchise. The basis story that will eventually culminate in the long awaited 'Infinity War' has been carefully pieced together for over a decade, initially with storied concerned with a single hero, gathering them into a team and introducing the ultimate plot device, the infinity stones. The Guardian movies brought the action beyond the little corner of the universe occupied by our home, Earth. Most of the significant enemies the heroes assembled so far have battled enemies from distant worlds but usually defending their own home turf. Now, the cosmos is open and the battle ground reaches beyond the stars.\n\nAfter their victory in the first film, the Guardians have been working as soldiers of fortune. In exchange for suitable reimbursement the team will undertake noble, yet somewhat lucrative missions. Their latest assignment was to protect special batteries capable of storing unimaginable power. The race that hired the Guardians for this seemingly straightforward assignment were known as 'the Sovereign race'. With golden skin, hair and eyes they consider themselves pinnacle of life in the galaxy. They were led by their queen, Ayesha (Elizabeth Dubicki). Their society is structured like the hive mind of bees with countless drones obeying the directives of their queen. The Guardian manage to perform their task and are remunerated accordingly but Rocket (voice/performance capture Bradley Cooper) cannot resist is intrinsic need to steal. Before handing over the prize he pockets several of the batteries. The client is obsessive particularly in keeping track of such powerful items quickly realizing the count is short. They launch a massive attach utilizing drones. These craft are individually guided by members of the hive each manning a control station. The scene does bare similarities to scenes in 'last Star Fighter' and 'Bender's Game' has the ultimate use of video games.\n\nWhat most would call a defeat, Ayesha, regards as a setback. She hires Peter's former associates, Yondu Udonta (Michael Rooker) and his band of Ravagers. Yondu was banished by the Assembled hierarchy of Ravengers, for breaking their most forbidden taboos. The infractions included one of the despicable offenses, kidnapping children from across the galaxy. Years ago, Peter Quill was one of those victims. Yondu is charged with tracking Quill down and retrieve the batteries. Faced with the revelation of Yondu's involvement in child trafficking, a substantial portion of his crew mutiny. Ignited by Yondu refusing to hand Peter over, only a few members of the crew remain loyalists. The mutineers, led by a lieutenant, Taserface (Chris Sullivan), impressions Yondu while systematically executing the Loyalists by blasting them out the airlock. Yondu is imprisoned is with Rocket and Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) but stripped of his whistle controlled plasma arrow. Fortunately, one traitor was feigning his defection, Kraglin, portrayed once again by the director's brother, Sean Gunn. He mangers to bring the controlling crest to Yondu to effect revenge and escape. This might be described as an extreme form of repeal and replace the article of mutiny.\n\nWhile this is unfolding Peter, Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and Dax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista), are rescued becoming the guests of a godlike celestial, Ego (Kurt Russel).his human form is an avatar for his true physical nature, a living planet. Ego discloses that although he has sired countless offspring, Peter is the only on alive thanks to his inheritance of celestial traits. This is what allowed him to hold an Infinity stone during the conclusion of the first film. Ego shows Peter how to begin using those creative abilities, albeit on a nascent level. Ego is accompanied by an attractive youthful female, Mantis (Pom Klementieff), a powerful empathy necessary to help Ego to relax sufficiently to slumber. Mantis becomes intrigued with Dax, who is unable to understand nuance in speech and metaphorical references. Peter is elated by finally meeting his father but as Gamora realizes, is blinded to the ulterior motives of Ego. Gamora has her own family reunion moment upon reuniting with her estranged sister, Nebula (Karen Gillian). Animosity has been building since their childhood but now they must discover some way to put that aside and united against a foe of unlimited power and billions of years of experience, Ego. Although Ego initially does everything he can to be a warm and kindly father figure. Peter has been wondering about his biological father for most of his life so when he finally meets him and discover he has godlike power, life, for once, seemed great. It turns out that the best thing in the Star Lord's life is his steadfast, loyal friends that distrust this entity and are willing to unite against him to save Peter.\n\nThis film represents the epitome of why Marvel has been crushing DC in the Cineplex. There is a near perfect combination of action, adventure humor and poignant human drama. Each character is finely drawn gathering details from the entire MCU and, in this instance, the previous instalment. The one major personality traits that overlap most characters is family, particularly parentage. Peter lost his mother and just met his father. Gamora and her sister/nemesis Nebula always contended for the attention of their adopted father, the arch villain and ultimate Big Bad of the MCU, Thanos (Josh Brolin), a powerful Titan after the Infinity Stones. Dax is driven by the murder of his family by Thanos and underlying everything is a relationship that was always there but unspoken as far as it's intensity. Growing up, Yondu superficially was Peter's captor constantly threatening to devour the boy. During the film this relationship grows in importance pulling all the treads and subplots together.\n\nThe humor used to punctuate the action ideally offers the audience to catch their breath between amazingly well choreographed battles. The heart of the Guardians is undoubtedly the tree-like Groot. After sacrificing himself at the end of the first movie Groot has regenerated and is now an adorable baby. Still restricted to only saying \"I am Groot\", the antics between him and Rocket provide a solid emotional foundation. This is an achievement that has eluded DC in their comics, continuing to plague their movies few movies can provide such a complete measure of satisfaction and sheer entertainment as the MCU and this offering adds to that growing legacy. One unusual marketing decision demands noting. In Region 'A', North America, there are the usual formats; DVD, Blu/ray/DVD and 4K UHD. The film was made for Real 3D presentation in the theater and the use of the illusion of depth is exceptionally well executed. What is extremely unusual is the only home release of the film in 3D is for Region 'B', UK and Europe. This is happening with increasing frequency so I invested in a multi-region plater that supports 3D. for under $200 I purchased a Sony unit that plays everything, except, of course, 4K. it also supports DNLA and most popular streaming services including Amazon, Netflix, Hulu and Vudu. The later also plays there 3D streaming videos perfectly.",

            "content": "'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2' Ohana Means Family... and Friends\n The Guardians come back again and they make a thrilling entrance with a story now explaining who Quill (Star Lord) truly is and most importantly,  find out who his father is.  The Guardian team includes; Quill (Star Lord), Gamora, Drax, Rocket, and lastly, we can't forget about baby Groot who comes back to space to find answers as they fight to protect the ones in need and protect each other.. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2, a continual story of the first Guardians of the Galaxy, revolved the theme of what is most important to them, which is family.  This family friendly movie is sure to make you cry of sadness, happiness, and make you laugh till your stomach hurt. Now available to watch on Netflix, Guardians of the Galaxy yet once again, did not disappoint. For many reasons from this movie, I believe that the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2  is the best movie to reminisce the path in  life where we found out our true self and how friends and family are the most important people in our life. \nIt all starts in space somewhere far far away. When Quill sets out to live with his real father who finds the truth where the blood father only had intentions to use Quill's energy power to live infinitely with full power and take over other planets. Feelings of betrayal began to fill Quill, but his friends stick by him and save him from his evil father.  If it were not for his friends (the Guardians) and his step-father, Yondu, (who adopted him) that he would live again with high hopes and full of love.  When Quill realizes that his true family has been with him every step of the day, Yondu sacrifices his life as he saves Quill.  What can get more sentimental than that? Father willing to die at his own will to save his son... Something Star Wars lacked in portraying. Ouch. Yet, we can never forget the words of Yondu as he used his arrow to fly just minutes before he died,  \"I'm Mary Poppins y'all!\" which made it a difficult moment for the viewers to decide if one should cry of loss or giggle of his reference to Mary Poppins.  The author resolves to family and how each of the characters overcome them by using humor and life stories that connect to the viewers.  Continuing with the family theme, Gamora also experiences another encounter with her sister Nebula in Vol 2. The sisters, Gamora and Nebula, who could not stand to look at each other without feelings to kill one another, finishes well as they talked it out,  hugged it out, and forgive one another.  The story line between the two connects to the viewers for anyone who has had experience with siblings.. Along with the emotional roller coasters viewers get to watch and feel, we can not forget about baby Groot; a fan favorite for all. In a scene where it get unbearably intense, baby Groot is always there to soften the hearts of the people with sighs of  \"Awe\".. Not to mention who saves the day with his bravery and love for his friends.  The movie mainly created for grown up viewers who have lost their place remembers how it is like to have fought with a sibling, possibly lost a father, and found out one true self but though family and friends, they were able to feel comfort.\nOverall, this movie was portrayed very well with the theme of family. This theme made it best possible for adult to reminisce what was important to them and helped them in the past.  The  Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 was a reminder for people who are looking back from the past and coming to pass the relationship now.  Good expectations has met with this movie as I was pleased to experience the heart-warming scene that showed that friends are also family.  This is why I believe that the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2  is the best movie to remember that friends and family are the most important people in our life and to announce the memories of we had growing up.",

Don't waste a dime on developing a sensible plot because the hordes of fans will eat this crap up like it was a 5 star meal. Hence the 8.1 star rating which reflects a demographic with time on their hands and a studio with plenty of marketing budget.\n\nOn the bright side - the CGI is great. The sets are beautiful. There are some very funny moments. The cast still has some chemistry with each other. And I've seen movies that were much worse and unwatchable than this one. But I wouldn't be honest if I didn't give this a very generous 5 because of the horrendous, deficient plot. And after this film I'd have to say that I've about had enough with this series. We've heard the story, had some fun with the characters and it's clear that what was fun, fresh and original is what it should have been - a one film wonder leaving Hollywood to develop another story. \n\nWithout giving away the big reveal or true spoilers, I'll explain the problem that are evident throughout the entire film:\n\n(1) Repeated jokes as if we're supposed to be warmed to it, e.g. how dumb and oblivious baby Groot is (except when he needs not to be.) Funny at the opening moment and gets more difficult to stomach as we make our way through.\n\n(2) The fact that our heroes are never really in danger. They are always somehow able to avoid dangers of the most extreme kind for prolonged periods while they joke during the encounter and then you know they will be saved by some unknown force to be named shortly.\n\n(3) The abject stupidity of supremely smart characters. Because we need those whose level of intelligence is off the charts to continue to do some really stupid or missing the obvious for a prolonged period of time but just enough for our heroes to have the time to do something to save themselves and the galaxy from certain destruction.\n\n(4) The explanation of the villain's plan made absolutely no sense. It was the usual pseudo-brilliant but amorphous hogwash that only made sense when you were 5 years old in the world of make believe without having to think about whether there was any logic.\n\n(5) Occasional product placement. Fedex anyone? It's one thing to have a \"special moment\" and another to believe we're too stupid to understand why it happened. And then there is Baby Groot who exists and will continue to exist solely for merchandising... Too cute to kill off. ;)",

There's not really much to say about Pratt, Saldana, or Bautista, except for they basically acted as well as they did in the first movie. One of the complaints I have with the film is the villains. I didn't really care at all about them, and wasn't really given any reason to. They tried their best though, especially since they don't really have much to work with. Nebula's character development in the movie was really good in my opinion, and Kurt Russell did a fine job as Ego.",

This story does not have a great adventure in the galaxy. A simple quest, but a thrilling action-adventure. Now this accidental space gang is set to meet the creator.\n\nIt's time for Peter to meet his father, Ego. As he still upset with his mother's death, his encounter with his father was not as expectedly smooth. On the other side of the story, Rocket, Yandu, Baby Groot make their escape from the captivity. They all end up on the Ego's planet where the rest of the film going to take place. Being the guardians of the galaxy, their fight against the whoever threaten the safety of the universe once again tested with their strength as a team.\n\nJames Gunn did it again. And I'm confident that he's going to do the same for next as well. All the actors were fantastic like the previous film. This time, little fun with little Groot. Anybody who loved the first would love it too. Being a franchise from Marvel universe, it is yet to join the 'Avengers'. So far so good. I'm now expecting one of the best of best trilogies.

The same chemistry is there, and the actors and actresses are obviously comfortable in their zone. While in that zone there is several new and older characters that make their appearance. My favorite new character is Mantis. I really think her and Drax would make a good couple (yes I am a romantic).\n\nI don't think this is too spoilery, but Quill gets to meet his father, and I think they made an excellent choice by selecting Kurt Russell. It felt natural, and even though I saw the character arc with his dad it was interesting. As a side note there are several cameos that are great as well.\n\nMy favorite character though in this one was Yando. I like Michael Rooker in a lot of things, but I really think this is my favorite role of his. The relationship between Quill and him, and the actual story behind his raising of Quill made him a very satisfactory character.\n\nThe movie itself is full of good actions scenes, and even though I really wasn't fond of the golden Sovereign, it was a lot of fun to watch. I even enjoyed the 5 after credits scenes, my favorite involves Groot and Quill. I do have to say that movies are getting out of hand with after credit scenes. Couldn't they just put it at the end of the movie and not make us wait 10 minutes through credits?\n\nIt is definitely a see in the theater kind of movie.\n\nThe good: It is more of the same as Volume 1, with the addition of more Rooker and some funny cameos.\n\nThe bad: I didn't particularly like the sovereign, and after credit scenes have to stop.",

What more could you ask for in a summer blockbuster?\n\nAside from hits like \"The Dark Knight,\" \"Terminator 2: Judgement Day\" and \"The Empire Strikes Back,\" most sequels fail to capture the ingenuity, wit or sheer awe of their predecessors. However, as Norman Vincent Peale once said, \"Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars.\" In that vein, \"Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 2\" shines brightly.\n\nThe film continues the story of Peter Quill/Star Lord (Chris Pratt) and his mangy band of criminals, warriors and assassins, who must once again save the galaxy from certain destruction. While James Gunn's first film masterfully introduced us to Marvel's cosmic realm and the quirky individuals that inhabit it, \"Guardians 2\" foregoes a conventional superhero narrative arc in favor of a more personal, character-driven story.\n\nFrom Gamora and Nebula's disdain for their father, Thanos, to the Guardians' fluctuating relationships with one another, the story largely focuses on family. Many critics were put off by Karen Gillan's portrayal of Nebula during the more impactful, heartfelt scenes. For me, however, humanity and sincerity shone through her acting and in the small details of her damaged history with Thanos and Gamora.\n\nThe Guardians themselves, as always, exude confidence and chemistry, with much of the film's humor stemming from Baby Groot (Vin Diesel), Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista).\n\nGunn's visual direction is impeccable, characterized by vibrant colors and grand set pieces. And the soundtrack, \"Awesome Mix Vol. 2,\" while less recognizable as the first volume, compliments the film's themes to near perfection.\n\n\"Guardians 2\" isn't groundbreaking. Not all of the jokes land, the secondary villains are, at times, annoying and it does little to further the overarching narrative if the Marvel cinematic universe. Overshadowing these nitpicks, however, is a glimpse into the souls of the characters we know and love, several gut-wrenching laughs and Baby Groot.",

I hope you have a appetite for jokes about turds, reference to David Hasselholf, and other asinine, referential humor from 80's pop culture( remember Cheers and Mary Poppins? Cus they have jokes about that for some reason.)\n\nGuardian of the Galaxy vol 2 isn't so much bad as it is lazy, but it plays to it audience with onslaughts of sophomoric humor and Micheal Bay OVER-THE-TOP style action that's intently  grandiose but somehow boring and stupid for my taste, which I assume most people find appealing. I didn't like this movie, but ironically like the set up for vol. 3, which is the movie I'd rather be watching than this silly bullshit!",

If by chance you're a semi-recreational believer in a debunked theory that god and the snow elves made Christmas in seven days which means the earth is approximately 6,000 years old then you might enjoy the theological aspects of the movie, along with its exploration of how something can exist where nothing once dwelled. On the other hand if you're a hard core everyday creationist this might take you over the edge into believing that baby Groot is the second coming of Jesus and Sylvester Stalone is a reincarnated John the Baptist.\n\nI thought I'd just get that out of the way, you have been warned.\n\nGuardians Vol 2 has to be judged by its own merits, and by that I mean it has to rigorously stand up to the standards set by the first, which in my opinion it does quite nicely. It's a very funny movie with a soundtrack to match the original. The characters are all very unique and if you're discovering them for the first time you'll enjoy their Marvel abilities and quirky sense of humour, not too unlike Deadpool if one was to look for a comparison.\n\nThere are some awful bits of course, the constant relationship whinging, some implausible action scenes, the annoying storyline in which every character seems to have parenting issues, gold raced space pilots who can't fly spaceships, and an ending so unbearably cheesy that it made me think the movie was completely ruined, but I projectile vomited and remembered this movie was for the creationists and I shouldn't judge them for their stupidity.\n\nWhat this film does very well is open with an action scene, shot from the musical perspective of the Baby Groot, who continues to bring some adorable and hysterical scenes throughout. There are some gritty space deaths, emotional outbursts (not Stalone's one but other ones), and enough rocket moments to make this an entertaining movie, all in all it stacks up as a great cinema experience with stunning visuals and great characters.  As a marvel space movie it's worth a watch, even if you are of scientific mind, just ignore the usual ignorance for the laws of gravity and don't be too concerned about the wholesale alien interbreeding by the universe's most god like Caucasian male who just wants to bond with his chosen son, who just so happens to be American, it's a coincidence, the universe is a big place anything could happen, infinite possibilities, somewhere there could be a universe where the earth is actually no more than 6000 years.....no wait scrap that thought....that's still irrational.\n?\nI am Groot",

The witty script worked extremely well, and the crazy soundtrack, along with a decent storyline, made this epic sequel a must watch. The movie kicks off with the Guardians of the Galaxy saving the world, once again, and when they go to give the Golden Queen, Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki), some precious batteries, Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) decides to steal them back, and they end up on the run from Ayesha's soldiers. With nowhere to go, and there ship under severe attack, a little man comes out of nowhere, and destroys all of the ships that are attacking them. When they finally land the ship in the middle of nowhere, they are approached by Peter Quills (Chris Pratt), dad Ego (Kurt Russell), who takes them to his Wonderland, which amazes them all. Gamora (Zoe Saldana) finds the whole situation a bit weird, while Drax (Dave Bautista) bonds with Ego's righthand girl Mantis (Pom Klementieff). After listening to his dads plans for the future, and the reasons why he left his mum, Peter soon realises that his dad has an inner evil, which isn't good for the world, so the Guardians are forced into battle against the evil Ego. There are many other elements to the film but that is the core of the movie. With such a deep backdrop, including the evil Queen and the Ravagers going wild, the comedy was top class, and baby groot was a brilliant addition to the crew. You can definitely see were every penny of the budget went, especially with the CGI characters, and the action scenes were also pretty impressive. The first scene, were the Guardians are fighting the big monster, was put together extremely well, and it was a great opening to a great franchise. I think you can tell that I really enjoyed this film, and I can't wait for the 3rd movie. Great!\n\nRound-Up:\nThe question that I have about this film is, Are they going to join this franchise to the other Marvel movies? They don't really have super powers, and the Guardians are based in space, so I don't know how they would do it! Anyway, this movie was directed by James Gunn, 51, who also brought you the first movie in this franchise, along with Slither, Super and Movie 43. Judging by the ending of the movie, it seems like there is going to be a 3rd Guardians, which is rumoured that he will direct but there hasn't been any leaks as of yet. I just hope that they don't get all serious with the next one, because the humour is what makes this a unique classic. \n\nBudget: $200million\nWorldwide Gross: $863million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their Sci-fi/action/adventures, starring Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, Michael Rooker, Sylvester Stallone, Kurt Russell, Karen Gillan, Seth Green, Ving Rhames and Michelle Yeoh.  8/10",

            "content": "As funny as the first with even more heart.\n\nDirector James Gunn's superhero, science-fiction, fantasy, adventure, comedy Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) is a delightful film for the entire family to enjoy together. I am impressed by Gunn's ability to balance his infamously irreverent sense of humor with his genuinely moving family drama elements. I laughed and cried during Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.\n\nGunn's writing is neat as he delivers a creative story about Star Lord's Celestial origins alongside his arguing friends learning the values of family solidarity, loving relationships, understanding romance, nurturing fatherhood, steadfast sisterhood, personal creeds, and the bonds of friendship. Guardians of the Galaxy are odd characters in a ridiculous fantasy Marvel multiverse, yet Gunn makes them work as funny comedy bits and sincere character driven heroes.\n\nChris Pratt's Star Lord is every bit as goofy, charismatic, and surprisingly touching. You can tell he really tried his best to keep up with the high caliber cast James Gunn assembled here. Zoe Saldana is the heart of the Guardians movies as the severely cynical, ultra cool, fierce fighter, and tender romantic heroine Gamora. I adore Saldana's Gamora with her distrusting glares and subtle perceptive faces underneath all of that green make-up.\n\nDave Bautista's Drax the Destroyer has a hearty laugh, sublime deadpan comedy delivery, fearsome strength, and fantastic charisma. I know Bautista feels that Drax is underdeveloped, but you get a feeling that Drax is a lovable idiot with his own morals and ideas alongside his endless quips and teasing commentary belittling Star Lord. Vin Diesel gets his voice pitched up as the expressive plant being Groot. Baby Groot is incredibly cute as he misunderstands everything people say to him this time around as he's basically been reborn. Bradley Cooper steals the show as usual with his snarky comebacks and hurtful insults as the genius, trigger happy, miserable Rocket Raccoon. Cooper is so funny, cool, and adorable as Rocket.\n\nKurt Russell's Celestial god Ego is fascinating. Russell is a phenomenal actor and understands when he has to play it friendly with the Guardians, paternal and kindly to Peter Quill when he's down, or intimidating when Ego goes mad. Michael Rooker honestly made me cry as Yondu. His arrow whistling is a killer sequence, but it's his nuances that let you know Yondu always cared about Peter Quill's safety and upbringing that hit home the hardest. \n\nKaren Gillan is beautiful, wicked, funny, and heartbreaking as Nebula. She's captivating alongside Saldana's Gamora as they grow their sibling rivalry into a close sisterly bond of love, respect, and mutual pain. Gillan ensures you're always aware of when Nebula is suffering, annoyed, bored, furious, or moved. Pom Klementieff is wonderful and lovely as the quirky alien Mantis. Her empath abilities are as sweet as her cute character Mantis. Pom Klementieff is a fabulous addition to the Guardians of the Galaxy. I hope we see more Mantis in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3! Elizabeth Debicki is stunning as the golden High Priestess Ayesha of the Sovereign. She's funny and compelling, but I'm most excited that she introduces us to Adam Warlock. I hope Gunn can manage such a serious, brooding, and thoughtful space wizard like Jim Starlin's beloved superhero Adam Warlock.\n\nSylvester Stallone is surprisingly compelling as the elder Ravager Stakar. Chris Sullivan's Taserface gets laughter, but Sean Gunn is both really moving to the point of tears as Kraglin. Tommy Flanagan's Tullk is similarly sensitive as Yondu's closest Ravager crewmates. Laura Haddock is nice as Peter Quill's mother Meredith Quill. Metal icons Richard Christy and Rob Zombie cameo as Ravagers. Seth Green voices Howard the Duck again. Stan Lee's cameo as a Watcher Informant is hilarious as a sweet nod to his love of the Cosmic Marvel comic storylines. David Hasselhoff's cameo is fantastic, really bringing home the fatherhood themes. Wyatt Oleff of IT fame cameos as Young Peter Quill again in a quick flashback if you look hard. Ving Rhames and Michelle Yeoh have fun cameos. Producers Stan Lee and Kevin Feige really got every big name around here somewhere.\n\nEditors Craig Wood and Fred Raskin cut swiftly for a fast pace, but really impressed me with their sharp transition from Ego's Planet to other areas with striking tastefulness. Cinematographer Henry Braham shoots truly breathtaking wide shots of Ego's flowery planet like Gamora pondering by herself or Ego's palace doors with Mantis and Drax speaking. Braham's close-ups are no joke either like for Nebula tearfully looking Gamora in her eyes. I felt like Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is certainly one of Marvel's best shot pictures.\n\nProduction designer Scott Chambliss created a truly beautiful planet for Ego with lush colors like you've never seen. All the lavish sets for Ego and Sovereign's planets are stylish. Art directors Thomas Valentine, Ramsey Avery, Vlad Bina, Stephen Christensen, Harry E. Otto, Jann K. Engel, Elena Albanese, George Hull, Iain McFadyen, Daniel Frank, Kevin Houlihan, and Haisu Wang really did space concepts with an amazement for the unknown and supernatural. Set decorator Jay Hart makes the ships look realistic and lived in with junk everywhere for flavor alongside all the neat sci-fi props and futuristic furnishings.\n\nVisual effects artists Jonathan Fawkner, Brian Adler, Alessandro Cioffi, Guy Williams, Christopher Townsend, Graham Martin, Simone Kraus, Townsend Adrian, Corsei Lluis, Casals Marsol, Lidia Martinez Prado, Arslan Elver, and Alexander T.H. Browne refined every CGI visual into something believable. Rocket and Groot just look real in most scenes. Mantis and Ego's glowing powers look as real as the spaceships and morphing Ego. \n\nComposer Tyler Bates delivers moving and uplifting score themes with a memorable main melody. James Gunn's soundtrack choices are eclectic with a nostalgic warmth and exciting energy that matches the tone of each scene with a song accompanying it. I especially loved hearing George Harrison's \"My Sweet Lord\" and Fleetwood Mac's \"The Chain.\"\n\nSound designers Christopher Boyes, David Acord, Lora Hirschberg, Lee Gilmore, and Addison Teague make Yondu's whistling arrow speed by in style and come up with huge crashing sounds for all the spaceships exploding. \n\nCostume designer Judianna Makovsky crafted sultry, cool, fashionable, and practical outfits for Gamora, Nebula, Mantis, and Ayesha. I loved her looks for the ladies. Of course Star Lord, Drax, Ego, and Rocket all have cool suits too like the gritty Ravager uniforms. Make-up artists John Blake and Daniel McGraw outdid themselves as Gamora, Nebula, Mantis, Ayesha, and Drax just look so realistic that you never question what they are in context of the Guardians of the Galaxy.\n\nIn short, James Gunn's peerless craftsmanship, care, humor, and heart provide the thoughtful backdrop for his dream ensemble to deliver funny and touching acting performances all around.",

This movie didn't have to be anything more than an extension of the first movie, which it was.  Funny, beautiful, well acted and scripted, and chock full of awesome music.  I thought that they did improve upon Gamora in this movie.  She looked cooler, and felt more fleshed out.  She was the weakest point of the first movie for me, she essentially felt like \"green-skinned alien sidekick girl\". In this movie her makeup is cooler, her costume is cooler, and the character development with her and Nebula was excellent.  \n\nWhile Baby Groot certainly steals the show, many of the other characters are really allowed to shine.  I think the obvious one to mention here is Yondu, but every other lead character has some great moments.  It is still funny to me that with the exception of one or two scenes, Drax is essentially maniacally laughing the whole time.  Mantis was a fun addition, and Kurt Russell was awesome.  I don't want to talk about him too much, for the sake of spoilers, but he was the perfect choice for the role.\n\nI am talking a lot.

            "content": "Not as strong as the first entry, but Guardians still has a unique formula that works for a genre stuffed with competitors. \n\nThis is a good popcorn flick with an added dynamic of really likable and interesting heroes. The use of campy comedy in these films is really excellent. Zoe Saldana and Chris Pratt also work really well together on screen and the \"unspoken something\" between them is fun and entertaining. Their interactions might not be terribly original, but it gets some fresh life with the Guardians over the top silliness. \n\nThere is some emotional heft to some parts of the movie, especially the end, which only happens when the characters are well done. They certainly are well done. Kurt Russell also does a good job embodying one of the strangest characters in the marvel universe. \n\nThe negatives are unsurprising for this type of movie, especially a sequel. In attempting to up the stakes of the origin story, the film gets almost too hard to follow. The stakes are nothing less than the very existence of the universe this time. I am also not opposed to eye candy and abstract villains, but the visual overload in this film starts to become too much. I was too fatigued by the time the big showdown finally happened that the stakes seemed meaningless. \n\nAction can be so much more powerful when it burns slower and less often. The film simply progresses too fast and rams in too much. Some of the simple dialogue scenes with all of the characters is what makes these movies work so well, there is no reason not to add more of that to break up the action.\n\nPerhaps my biggest issue with this movie though is that it commits that horribly irritating sin of constantly telling the audience what they already surmised. Why do all of these cosmic level movies feel required to narrate so much of what we already now? You do not need CGI dioramas to visualize the story being told, you do not need to repeat lines about obvious feelings and spell out those feelings. These things work so much better when the audience knows enough and fills in the rest themselves.",

You've already introduced all the characters, now you can play around with them.  They know each other, their chemistry is set, and now they're off on an adventure.  And this is a really fun adventure.  Without getting too much into spoiler territory, Star-Lord's search for his dad and the ultimate reveal of who/what his dad is really worked for me.  It's kind of silly, but never feels absurd.  With each strange new detail, I wanted to know even more.\nIt's primarily Star-Lord's story with the other Guardians along for the ride, but they aren't pushed to the side.  They have a role to play in this thing, and their family dynamic really works.  All their personalities from the first movie are intact, but usually developed a bit.  Namely Drax, who is much less dour, but this is not only more fun but fits with his character now having a family of sorts.  The only major change is Groot, but Baby Groot is so adorable and so much fun it just works.  Even some characters who didn't get much attention from the first movie now get major arcs.  Yondu now has one of the most heart-wrenching story arcs in the whole movie.  The evolution of these characters from the first one to this one adds a lot of heart and depth to the whole thing.\nThe action is also some of the best of any of the MCU films.  The opening scene really sets the tone for the whole thing.  Baby Groot is dancing to Star-Lord's Awesome Mix while the team is fighting a giant tentacle monster in the background.  The fight itself is mostly shown in the background, with the focus decidedly on Groot.  That's the attitude of a lot of the action scenes.  James Gunn seems to know that there's not much in the realm of sci-fi action for him to show us that we haven't already seen, so he twists it in some way or shows it from a different perspective that gives it a fresh and entertaining perspective.  Oh and did I mention the movie is hilarious?  Do I even need to mention that the movie is hilarious?\nWhat more do I need to say?  I loved this movie.  It's a great sequel, and a great film on its own.  Once it was over I wanted to watch it all over again.  It's just a ton of fun.  A great adventure with a great batch of characters with great chemistry.  A summer blockbuster in its purest form, Guardians 2 is just great.",

Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Bradley Cooper and Dave Bautista are all as good as they were in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.1 but Michael Rooker is given a bigger role than in the first and excels in more comedic and emotional moments in the film. Pom Klementieff is a strong addition to the cast as Mantis, as an empath she is used somewhat as a devise to move the plot forward but she is well acted by Klementieff and has very good chemistry with the rest of the cast.\nThis is a surprisingly good sequel which serves to delve deeper into the characters we grew to love in the first film and has some genuinely heartfelt moments. Some of the jokes fall a little flat and they overuse Drax's blunt sense of humour a little too much, which undercuts some of the more serious moments. The action scenes aren't quite as good as in the first film, the fight at the opening of the film is fun and well shot but at the climax of the film there are an excessive number of ships and an over reliance of flashy visuals which have no tension or excitement to them as apposed to a one to one fight. \nOverall, it never quite hits that mark that made the first film so special but it's an enjoyable romp nonetheless and fairs better than a lot of other Marvel sequels.",

            "content": "SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Greg, looks like the galaxy needs saving yet again. Do you think the Guardians are equal to the task?\n\nGREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) My opinion is guarded at best. Let s recap:\n\nSCOTT: The Guardians are back: Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket (Bradley Cooper), and Baby Groot (Vin Diesel). The group has been asked by the Sovereign race to fight and destroy a huge monster from another dimension. In exchange, the Guardians receive custody of Gamora s evil sister Nebula (Karen Gillan). When the Sovereigns discover that Rocket has stolen valuable batteries, they give chase and force the Guardians to crash land on nearby planet.\n\nGREG: And who should be on that planet but Quill s long lost father, Ego (Kurt Russell). He wants Quill to work with him to rule the galaxy. Ego teaches Quill to draw power from the planet to create magical power balls and other stuff. Meanwhile, Nebula has escaped and is in search of Gamora to kill her. And Drax is making friends with Ego s sidekick, the empath Mantis (Pom Klementieff). While Rocket and Yondu (Michael Rooker) are searching the galaxy for their lost friends. It s wild and wacky mayhem in a galaxy not so far, far away.\n\nSCOTT: Greg, Guardians Vol. 2 fascinated me. I couldn t help think that this entertaining screenplay was penned by a group of Marvel writers who were a bit inebriated -- by alcohol and by the unparalleled success of their movie studio. Guardians Vol. 2 is Marvel s 15th straight number one opening at the domestic box office. And this movie feels like a film drunk on its own success. What this means exactly is that the movie winks at itself and is saturated with irreverence. David Hasselhoff from Baywatch makes a cameo; the soundtrack thunders with 1970s hits; a giant pac-man swallows up the villain; and we learn that Drax has sensitive nipples and generates large turds. Just when I thought that the film was missing a reference to Mary Poppins, sure enough we got one. Marvel films have always boasted some of these droll elements, but along with Deadpool I think the studio has now crossed the line into the comedy genre and is veering perilously close to Spaceballs in the wisecracking department. Don t get me wrong, I enjoyed Guardians Vol. 2. But let s not begin to think about this movie as a serious hero story packed with meaningful life lessons. Guardians Vol. 2 is a high-quality space comedy, and coupled with Deadpool it underscores the increased comedic trajectory of Marvel.\n\nGREG: If by  high-quality  you mean that the filmcraft was excellent, then I ll agree. The CGI, camerawork, and acting are all first-rate. But the story lacked any coherence. The main plotline seemed to be Quill s reuniting with his father and mending the pain of being abandoned by him. The secondary plot involved sisters Gamora and Nebula reconciling after years of sibling rivalry. So, the theme of this movie seems to be  family . But there was scant little plot. There was no  main goal  to be acquired. Rather, we re to be sustained by the ongoing mystery of  who is Ego  and a ton of wisecracks. If Guardians is, indeed, a spoof or farce, then story may fall prey to comedy. As we ve seen recently, horror and comedy stories often lack strong story lines as they, instead, rely on shock and awe. However, I expect more from Marvel and from my science fiction adventure films. There wasn t a clear villain in this story until the very end when Ego is revealed to be evil. Without a strong villain, you cannot have a strong hero. And so, Quill is just following his father along until he realizes that he s not a very nice guy and must be destroyed. But this realization doesn t occur until the three-quarter mark and by then it s much too late. I was hopelessly bored by Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.\n\nSCOTT: I can see your point, Greg. We ve watched plenty of movies that are long on comedy and short on storytelling. I don t think Guardians Vol. 2 is the best example of movies of this type. There are two stories running parallel here, one involving family division moving toward reconciliation (or lack thereof) and the other focusing on the Guardians  mission to save the universe. The two stories are effectively intertwined, too, with the seemingly good dad, Ego, turning out to be the father from hell, and the seemingly bad dad, Yondu, turning out to be the terrific father. Ego s efforts to destroy the universe must be stopped and our heroes do the job. The transformations here are interesting. Quill, Gamora, and Nebula glean significant insights about family, loyalty, and love. In our book Reel Heroes & Villains, we call this a mental transformation. The character of Yondu seems to especially evolve into selfless heroism, undergoing a moral transformation. Nebula also experiences significant emotional and moral transformations. So all told, I ll have to rate the film highly on this dimension.\n\nGREG: The traits we look for in heroes are here. Quill looks to do the right thing by himself and his crew. Gamora is loyal to Quill and her friends. And even when battling her estranged sister, shows mercy and compassion. The transformations are less clear. Quill doesn t seem changed by his experience. He s still  Star Lord  by the end of the film. And while Gamora and Nebula have reconciled, they re still who they were at the beginning of the film. And Drax and Rocket continue to be Drax and Rocket. And this should come as no surprise - as this is a franchise film. The films are episodic. So, we need our characters to reset at the end of each episode. We keep coming back to these films because we expect to see the characters we ve come to know and love. So, any true transformation is squelched by the need to return the characters to their initial states.\n\nSCOTT: Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 represents another Marvel triumph, despite my misgivings about their film products slowly evolving in farce. We have strong, memorable characters comprising the heroic ensemble; there are two parallel-running plots that satisfy us emotionally; and we are treated to remarkable CGI effects. The opening 5-minute scene featuring a dance number by Baby Groot dazzles us and is worth the price of admission by itself. I am concerned that Marvel films are morphing into a theater of the absurd, but even with this concern I would be a curmudgeon to award this film anything less than 4 Reels out of 5. These Guardians remain a diverse and highly enjoyable set of heroes. As you mention, Greg, they possess many heroic traits and their strengths complement one another. They go on a pretty standard hero s journey, encounter unexpected friends along with a surprising villain, they undergo change, and they live up to their job description by saving the galaxy. The timeless message at film s end is that the main hero, Quill, had the secret to success within him all along. I see every reason to award this hero ensemble a rating of 4 Heroes out of 5. Greg, I m surprised you don t see as much hero transformation going on as I do. Perhaps you are focusing only on inner transformation, which is understandable since that s how we describe the concept of transformation in our last Reel Heroes book. But I can t overlook the power of relationship transformation. Relationships in this film undergo vast change -- consider the relationships between (1) Quill and Ego, (2) Quill and Yondu, and (3) Gamora and Nebula. They are all completely metamorphosized. And each relationship metamorphosis reflects deep changes within each party involved in the relationship. As such, I award this film 4 transformation Deltas out of 5. Movie: Transformations: Heroes:\n\nGREG: I guess I m a curmudgeon, then, Scott. I was totally bored by Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. This was a CGI fest with no story to speak of. I wasn t impressed with Quill s gradual realization that Ego was a bad guy. And I wasn t impressed with Rocket and Yondu flying through 700 wormholes. And I wasn t impressed with the battle between the two sisters Gamora and Nebula. There was no plot and that left me waiting for over 2 hours for something to happen. I give Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 only 2 out of 5 Reels. These are bland heroes with no particular qualities that made me care about them. Yondu in particular has always been a sort of gray moral character. So when he was revealed to be a father figure for Quill, I was not bowled over. I didn t feel any sense of loss when he died. I give these characters just 2 Heroes out of 5. And while I ll grant you some relationship deltas, Scott. This is an action adventure and I wanted to see something more for transformations. This was not a romantic comedy or drama - so a relationship transformation isn t interesting. But as I said before, these are episodic heroes and transformation is not in their model. I give them 2 Deltas out of 5. Movie: Transformations: Heroes:",

Critics as well as fans loved it, and everyone was humming its songs. Naturally, when a sequel was announced, it had to fill the big shoes of its predecessor.\n\nSequels don't do well in the superhero genre or in any genre actually. Though this film is not all bad, it doesn't match up with the first one. The funky tunes are back and the film is a visual spectacle full of colours.\nWhere it lacks though is with its villains and character development. Let's talk about character development first. Only some of our characters get the spotlight in this film. As it explores Peter's parentage we learn a bit more about him, Youndu, Gamora and Nebula. Whereas Rocket and Drax are pushed aside.\n\nThe villains come off as boring. I don't like films where they make the bad guy look good at first and later reveal their true intentions. The Gold people aren't very memorable either. Most of the jokes do not land and feel forced.\n\nWhile this sequel isn't on par with the first one, it still keeps you interested, and is still worth watching. Stay till the end of the film for FIVE after-credits scenes.\n\nRecommended!",

            "content": "Will the price increase to save the galaxy for the second time?\n\nThe inaugural chapter of the most irreverent galactic mercenaries from Marvel was a gigantic turning point in the path set by superhero movies. \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" was one of the best - and completely fortuitous-proposals in 2014, a carefree sci-fi film that divorced in full from the general storyline that, by requirement, has to follow regarding the super longed final outcome called \"Infinity War\". Its massive success was mainly due to inexorable features as the different and unusual-at that time-humor types present in the characters, the visuals as artificial as extraordinary or a soundtrack based on the 80's Walkman, which were developed with ease on the three true foundations: Story (screenplay), Actors (performances) and director (decisions). From all, that colorful and hilarious mix comes the expected \"Vol. 2 \", which remains stable in relation to the first one and satisfies the enormous expectation that was on the shoulders of the guardians, who not only saved cosmic characters, also a couple of terrestrial individuals.\n\nIf the creative outbursts of the writer seemed eccentric in the first film by virtue of the composition of apparently nothing correlated tones and genres, in this one, James Gunn is fully unleashed from any impediment in a story of living planets, hybrids between deities and humans and allusions to Mary Poppins. The director preserves his characteristic flame innovating and relating exotic formulas even in the opening since later in the astonishing 80's introduction, the initial sequence ratifies a cosmic and comical aura almost equal to its predecessor, orchestrated by multi-functional Gunn, a man who knows perfectly how to manage the tools at his disposal. After it sets us in the atmosphere, the plot slides, unlike the previous one, to delve into the traumas and the open questions, including the leitmotif of the feature film: to find Peter Quill's lineage, while each one of the characters receives a meritorious treatment of their past in the form of dyads, having behind them an intergalactic ships army and a father with wicked purposes, getting an emotional and tension level according to its outstanding visual risks.\n\nHere, the triad of elements, that were as original as refreshing in the first installment, are strengthened, getting the same heart with a similar wrapper, it's really a continuation, not a clone. The most important pillar is the story, the plot around which the movie will have to be meant. Before it was about setting up a dysfunctional family, now, it's about being a dysfunctional family. With a general structure established, its writer, who is also a director, chooses to explore and clarify the past of his pieces, since due to its dazzling introduction was possibly a wide and amusing deepening of its roots. In addition, this study is applied to the introduction of new Guardians: Mantis, Yondu, and Nebula, who arrive to transform the quintet into an octet of light hearted fun, finding in them a new breath to irreverence of the core stars. Likewise, within that sea of fabulous inclusions, the scriptwriters insinuate and strengthen what they have been announcing for some time: Independent of the appearances in \"Infinity War\" or future movies, the story-as a team-of the Guardians will have three films, nothing more, nothing less, however, the filmmaker has insinuated that although the official closing of the cycle of Stard-Lord and his gang ends with the longed for third one, we could see more movies, in the distant future, of the Guardians, but... Of who? With great feasibility may be referring to the ancestors of Gamora and Groot, the former Guardians who, as cameos, make their first glimpse into the universe, a new crew led by master Sylvester Stallone, of whom it has been spoken will have a leading role in the development of Phase Three, but, would Marvel is willing to change the unbridled tone of the guardians, which served as a lighthouse in past years for the atmosphere of its movies, for a more serious one of the guardians of before? It's unlikely but lucrative.\n\nMarvel risks its life with an unseen masterstroke in its film compendium so far, a knack that added and reduced at the same time, a narrative skill called Ego the Living Planet. With a brilliant performance by Kurt Russell, this living man-planet not only catches the attention of the new characters but also steals easily the antagonist of the central villain: Ayesha. Elizabeth Debicki seems wasted in this commotion of modernistic faces, her mean and authoritarian attitude, besides having a little time on screen, doesn't get a real impact, the trouble is that she was the main villain, not a supporting character, her impetus of revenge against the guardians are taken to the extreme and despite her excellent performance within the bright chrome and extravagant golden suits, her evildoer has neither effect nor tact. Despite all, it displays the care that Marvel is taken in villains, its weakness in most of the preceding movies, in which the hero is conspicuous by the absence of a real malignancy.\n\nIt happens with very few motion pictures, \"Guardians\" is in that strange but thankful section. Even though humans will always get swept up in visuals, seeing is believing!, James Gun's film, like its predecessor, presents an authentic, nostalgic and a maddening musical compendium from the late 1970s/early 1980s, hits enhancing the scenes with regard to the seen ones in the universe. While \"Mr. Blue Sky\" by Electric Light Orchestra provides the best and most monumental opening for a Marvel movie,\"The Chain\" by Fleetwood Mac orchestrates one of the most mind-blowing sequences that Phase 3 of the MCU has been able to set up, to this mix of yesteryear, we can add it a few songs that are right on target in the dramatic moments, which also make way for the best of Marvel. One can feel the value and the impact that a simple melody can have in the cinema, and here, all his team appreciates it and gives the indicated treatment to such an emotional tool, and it happens with very few motion pictures. \n\nDo you want an appetizer? See the teaser trailer. Another extra? See the official trailer. But in case you are still overcome by doubts, another one? Delight yourself with the opening sequence. The pictures are sickeningly sweet like a visit to a candy shop, prevailing and vigorous like the guilty pleasure of entering the shop. The range of colors is phenomenal, and its application boosts greatly that feeling, moreover, the way to sort the components in the scene is beautiful, colorful; a harmony vis-\u00e0-vis with each character. However, they episodically fail in the well-known \"more is less\" proverb, even thought Ego's planet is paradisiacal, the screen is crowded of pigments and dizzying gadgets for the spectator, tarnishing the beauty of photography, from superhero world newcomer Henry Braham. It's worth highlighting the remarkable work in the editing room, that in addition to vivify scenes, produce mind-boggling IMAX and 3D screenings, that will leave you astounded. Also, it's meritorious to applaud the exact length of the film, those two hours and eighteen minutes don't feel unused at all.\n\nAnd Gunn keeps on to inscribe rules for upcoming superhero movie directors. The filmmaker concludes his feature film, his work, his son, his beloved in an intimate and melancholy way, producing a breath of hope and affliction at the same time, something that, at first glance, doesn't fit into the atmosphere of the story, but that after following the crazy adventures of our guardians for two hours feels phenomenally effective. A smile and a goodbye hurt more than hundreds of blows and Gunn has shown (also) to know how to handle it. He's a peculiar director, that has pros and cons like any other man-but more pros-, the priority for music, the character design, the importance of comedy and drama, the tidiness imposed on frames and a few hazards crossing their minds. It seems Marvel will continue at the service of the demands and ideas of this talented man and his squad of characters, demonstrating in this installment more of everything, duplicating what we liked about the first one, but giving it personality to a film as fun as tear-producing simultaneously.",

The characters, the music, the story, and Yondu. Yondu's story was amazing. It surprised me, it made me laugh at moments, made me cry. Taking what GOTG 1 started with the soundtrack and making it even better with so many awesome moments, most of them including Yondu. This is certainly my favorite Marvel film or simply favorite film in general. So freaking good!",

In it's a place in the MCU this movie was inconsequential, the plot resolved itself which was not a desired outcome for the MCU with infinity war so close. There is a massive tone shift from its predecessor that leaves a bad taste in my mouth. The first guardians was a masterpiece that blended a fun atmosphere with deep sentiment. This movie attempted to replicate that, but failed by ruining every emotional moment with a crappy one-liner. Regardless the plot is all over the place and isn't clear. Most of the movie is spent developing the characters of Yondu and Ego despite both of them dying and exiting the MCU which leaves a bad taste. Meanwhile Mantis was hardly developped as a character despite her role as the next addition to Guardians and the MCU's hero list. As unfair as it is to compare a sequel to its original it'd be hard to critique this movie without looking back at the masterpiece guardians of the galaxy was and when you do that this movie failed to live up to its expectations. \nTo close up with a recommendation this movie is worth watching the first time and enjoyable, but the more I chew on the movie the more I dislike it and would never sit to watch again.",

While the original contained a lot of comedy, it was well executed and didn't take away from the story and instead added to it. Peter and Gamora's relationship is so uninteresting and it's about all either of them talk about. I can say however, Rocket Raccoon and Yondu were the only thing saving this movie from me despising it as the comedy surrounding them (for the most part) is witty, well-placed and genuinely funny and they lead to the only laughs I got out of the movie. Baby Groot was only there for the marketing as people are drawn to cute things even if they turn out to be absolutely useless. Peter and his dad couldn't keep my interests throughout the movie and it all seemed kind of ridiculous to me, in my opinion this movie could have done A LOT of things better, and the comedy could have been much better written.",

This cast has the same chemistry as that of the cast in the Fast and Furious core group.  This is a movie about a family of misfits who come together to continue to save the Galaxy from destruction,.  Of all the Marvel movies, this is the team that you cheer for the most as they are striving to atone for their failings and do so in a spectacular manner.  It was pure genius to cast Kurt Russell as Ego in this movie, he and his wife Goldie have made spectacular returns to the big screen this year.  Kurt Russell has done his best acting ever in this movie.  He deserves some award consideration even if it is only a People's Choice Award.

But they knocked it out of the park in this imo. There was a surprising amount of raunchy jokes. There are both dick and poop jokes which I'm usually not a fan of, but them coming out of Drax's mouth was pure gold. The dude has comedic delivery like no other.\n\nThe character development in this movie is aces. The story is nothing special, but the character development surely makes up for it. The relationships between characters evolved so much. I loved these characters before, but I appreciate them even more now as individuals.\n\nAlso, Drax absolutely owns it.

Is it greater than the first though? It is hard to rank one above the other, but I still believe the first installment (in what is now going to be a trilogy) deserves the nod. Led by the continuously likable and charismatic Chris Pratt as Star-Lord, we join the Guardians on a journey across the planets and galaxies.\n\nVol. 2 introduces many new characters such as Mantis and Peter Quill aka Star Lord's father, Ego, the latter played by Kurt Russell. The characters of Drax and Rocket were hilarious as usual, Drax especially in many scenes. We learn more of the intense relationship between the sisters Gamora and Nebula, but there were two who really stood out for me: Baby Groot and (surprisingly) Yondu. Baby Groots time on camera created many laughs, not just for his sheer cuteness, but for his interactions with the other characters. Yondu in this movie was given far more story to deal with, and it certainly paid off. It made you really care for him on an emotional level, which does sound quite unusual given he is a ravager. And last but not least, Star-Lord, and being the lead character, deserved all the attention because he was great.\n\nThe movie was another great entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe and has created more anticipation for Avengers: Infinity Wars where we will see the Avengers team up with the Guardians. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 will provide more laughs, more emotion and more action for any movie viewer, led by a great director and cast.",

            "content": "The follow-up to one of the biggest surprises for cinema in recent years. I thought the first movie was going to be a failure. It came out during that time of year when summer movies are usually not very good, around August. It looked like it was going to be too silly when you look at it, a talking tree and a raccoon in space. How is this going to work? Well, it did work, and almost everybody really seemed to love it, myself included. The characters were so likable, the action was a ton of fun, and I really like how it took on a refreshing change in tone for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I got surprisingly so wrapped up in the action, the comedy, and even the drama of the first movie. However, many people are treating as one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever made and also their favorite MCU movie. I don't know if I can go as far to say it's one of my absolute favorites. It didn't leave that much of an impact on me. I thought it was extremely fun, hilarious, and definitely among the better Marvel movies; but at the same time I didn't think that much about it. Regardless, I still loved the movie.\n\nBecause we all loved the first movie, everyone got excited by for its sequel and thought it was going to be twice as good. But I kept my optimism for this movie low because I didn't want to be disappointed. From what I've initially heard about it, it's said to be not as good as the first one. It wasn't a surprise to hear that. After people adoring the original, they're likely to be disappointed with how its sequel turned out. So I went in to see this movie with that mindset.\n\nWatching the movie, I was trying to see where the people were coming from. I guess there are a few things about it that I can understand. Some of the humor did feel a bit forced. The movie felt like it did want to be twice as good as the first so they wanted to add twice the comedy. But sometimes the timing is a bit off. There were a couple of jokes that came at inappropriate moments, like when one character delivered a joke while another character was explaining her troubled past. I remembered not many people laughed at that part, that joke shouldn't have been delivered at that moment. Also, the story felt a bit choppy. There were many subplots that felt out of place when the movie goes from one scene to another. I was really getting into one scene, but then all of the sudden it jumps into another scene unrelated to what we just saw. Then it goes back to the previous scene after I was getting into that other scene. This cycle goes on throughout the movie and it gets a bit distracting. And one last thing, the character choices for the main villain are pretty clich\u00e9d. It's another one of those bad guys who want to control the entire universe. On the same subject, the side villains are absolutely useless and not the least bit intimidating. They never played a major role in the movie until one of the after-credit scenes, which I guess gives them a purpose the be in the movie.\n\nWith those reasons, I can understand why some people would be a bit disappointed with this movie since the first one didn't have those problems. The first one knew when to deliver the comedy, it had a much more flowing narrative. Although, both movies do have stereotypical bad guys. But what this movie had that the original didn't have enough of was character development. I really enjoyed the main characters in the first film, but I wasn't particularly interested in them. In this movie, we get to explore what makes these characters who they are as we get to know about their backstories and understand more of their relationships. Star-Lord is finding out something about his lineage that makes him special from the others and creates a dilemma between his friends and his father. His fatherly figure, Yondu, is realizing that he's been doing nothing right his entire life and his crew are giving him that treatment. With that, you suddenly feel sorry for one of the antagonists from the first film. The same thing with Nebula, she has had this strong rivalry with her sister Gamora that has inflicted her to do bad things. You can also feel for her character as well the relationship with Gamora since they're sisters. There's also a bond between Drax and a new character named Mantis about how their relationship grows just for who they are, I thought that was a very sweet and charming aspect to the movie. There's even a growing relationship between Yondu and Rocket Raccoon as they realize each other's similarities, both have had similar pasts and share some of the same traits. Yondu even gets along with Baby Groot, who by the way is the most adorable thing... ever! Anyway, it's this way of understanding the characters that really makes me care about them. For me, the most important aspect of any film is the characters. They are what we as human beings relate to, so if we understand the characters then we get invested in the movie. Basically, if I love and care about the characters, then I'll most likely love the movie.\n\nNot only that, this movie is hilarious! Even though I said the timing of the comedy doesn't always hit, most of it still works really well. There are many types of humor used here, with many references and visuals, a lot of it has to do with delivery along with one heck of a great soundtrack, and some are just completely random that you can't help but laugh at it. There's this one brilliantly random joke towards the end that almost had me in tears it was so funny. I think those who've seen the movie will know what it is, it's the most quoted line in the movie. It just goes to show that Marvel clearly wanted to have some fun. Even though I said the narrative of the movie was a bit choppy, the movie has great pacing. That's one other problem I had with the first movie is that the pacing was a bit inconsistent. There were moments where I was feeling a kind of bored and wanted some scenes to wrap up. In this movie, not ONCE did I ever feel bored! And the drama in this film is so strong, especially at the end. Never would I've thought there would be so much genuine emotion in a movie like this. Without giving away too much, one of the characters dies at the end. Because I cared and learned so much about that character, the death of that character was not only very emotional and even tear-jerking, but it felt earned; and it was handled in a way that made it feel important. I was even getting a little teary-eyed, which is rare for me.\n\nIf you haven't already guessed, I love this movie... a lot! I saw this movie three times already in the theater and I still want to see it again, that's how much fun I had with it. The action was extremely satisfying, the visuals are absolutely gorgeous and really colorful, almost all of the comedy works and is very clever, and the character development is incredibly strong. Because of that, I do enjoy this movie more than the original. I just really love these characters. Sure, the movie still has its flaws, but honestly, I had so much fun with this movie that I can pretty much overlook any of its problems. If you think you'll have fun with this movie, by all means, go watch it!\n\nGrade: A-",

            "content": "All hail James Gunn for accomplishing the ostensibly impossible: making a 2nd installment of a surprise break-out hit almost as great as the first. I say 'almost' because, inherently, Volume 2 loses traction because you can't duplicate the surprise factor. That's what made the first one so awesome - no one was expecting it. But now, we are totally expecting it, and even so, writer/director Gunn et al have definitely succeeded in delivering a sequel that is worthy of the first. It offers the same lightness and fun that the first one had in spades, and continues developing the characters that were introduced in the first. Though there are some new characters, the film spends most of its time expanding on the ones we already know, to mostly positive effect. My biggest disappointment with this movie is that you never get to see the Guardians in action as a unit; for the most part, everybody does their own thing, and the movie is focused on developing the characters individually rather than as a group. Volume 1 was spent establishing their origin story of how they came together to become more than the sum of their parts, and this film was primed to actually show us how awesome that could be. But alas, the group is immediately split up again, chasing their individual storylines. The story gets a little bogged down in the middle, as the two central storylines are mired in \"family themes\" and are a little too heavy. Luckily, there are Drax and Rocket and Groot to lighten things up. Strangely, Chris Pratt's inherent charm is rarely used for comedic effect. Instead, the film opts to land most of the humor on the shoulders of Rocket and Drax, who both rise to the occasion and deliver solid laughs... and who can possibly resist Baby Groot, who may be the most adorable and lovable character ever put to film? The film also further develops the former villains Yondu and Nebula, whose character arcs are welcome additions to the plot. This movie has a well written story, solid character development, lively action, and incredible visuals, which is really all you can hope for in a summer action flick. By the opening credits, I was grinning from ear to ear. True, it's not quite as fresh or funny as the first one was, but it is definitely as fun, and that's all that matters for a movie like this.",

            "content": "Mi Super REVIEW a \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2\"\nNo tiene nada de malo repetir la formula que te llev\u00f3 al \u00e9xito y James Gunn (Director/Guionista) lo sabe, solo que en esta ocasi\u00f3n excedi\u00f3 los limites. Hay que ser honestos, \"Guardianes de la Galaxia\" fue una sorpresa para todos, quien iba a pensar que unos superheroes desconocidos por parte del p\u00fablico general triunfar\u00edan en la cr\u00edtica y en la taquilla, incluso Gunn no se esperaba semejante \u00e9xito. Por lo que en esta segunda parte no tom\u00f3 grandes riesgos y volvi\u00f3 a usar la misma formula (comedia y acci\u00f3n sin limites) pero como dije anteriormente, Gunn no supo balancear la comedia y la acci\u00f3n de manera excelente en esta segunda parte como en la primera.\nGUARDIANES DE LA GALAXIA VOL 2 no es tan buena como la primera parte, es MUY inferior a su antecesora \u00bfEsto quiere decir que sea mala? No, pero \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 es inferior? Como lo mencione al inicio de esta \"cr\u00edtica\" Gunn exagera con su formula m\u00e1gica de comedia llegando ser excesivamente innecesaria en algunas ocasiones (no lo voy a negar, hay muchas partes que me hicieron \"cagar\" de risa)\npero por ejemplo: Drax (Dave Bautista) en los primeros minutos de la pel\u00edcula, de vez en cuando suelta una carcajada que al inicio es muy contagiosa, una o dos e incluso tres veces su risa causa mucha gracia, pero llega un punto en que utilizan tanto la risa de Drax que al final termina siendo inc\u00f3moda y hasta irritante.\nEn la primera pel\u00edcula tambi\u00e9n hay chistes, pero en mi opini\u00f3n nunca se sintieron forzados, la primera pel\u00edcula es un fest\u00edn de carcajadas que nunca se sienten forzadas, y ac\u00e1, de vez en cuando pasa todo lo contrario.\nAhora, otro aspecto que hizo que la primera pel\u00edcula fuera \u00fanica y diferente a todas las de Marvel fue la m\u00fasica \"AWESOME MIX\". En esta ocasi\u00f3n tenemos el \"AWESOME MIX VOL 2\" que termina siendo mal utilizado. En la primera pel\u00edcula, la m\u00fasica no solo se utilizaba para usarla de fondo, todo lo contrario, ayudaba a describir el estado de animo de los personajes, no se necesitaban de dialogos, solo con la m\u00fasica se pod\u00eda entender lo que estaba ocurriendo, logrando un lenguaje cinematogr\u00e1fico extraordinario. En esta segunda parte hay momentos en los que la m\u00fasica es mas \"m\u00fasica de fondo\" que otra herramienta para complementar la historia. Hay momentos en los que la m\u00fasica funciona (La escena final con la canci\u00f3n \"Father and Son\" sin duda queda como anillo al dedo.) pero lamentablemente son pocas las canciones las que se aprovechan de manera correcta.\nMARVEL sigue teniendo errores con sus villanos, y VOL 2 no es la excepci\u00f3n, la Villana pasa desapercibida por completo, tanto que nunca le tomaremos importancia.\nPes\u00e9 a todos los errores mencionados, tengo que decir que disfrut\u00e9 la pel\u00edcula, sus escenas de acci\u00f3n son espectaculares, hay varias escenas con excelente humor, pero sin duda alguna no supera a su primera parte, no es una mala pel\u00edcula, es buena, pero aun as\u00ed deja mucho que desear. El error y el que tiene la culpa es nada mas y nada menos que Gunn, quien escribi\u00f3 un gui\u00f3n sin arriesgarse a tomar nuevos caminos.\n\nDato curioso: James Gunn dirigir\u00e1 y escribir\u00e1 la tercera y ultima parte de Guardianes de la Galaxia; \u00bfQui\u00e9n debe estar mas asustado? \u00bfNosotros o \u00e9l?",

But it's pretty rare to find a sequel that dominates over the first installation. Gotta love Baby Groot. Love how they pick up right where they left off basically. I really enjoy the constant comedic bickering between all the Guardians. I love how Drax is so dim witted and ignorant. Great opening scene haha. Why don't we have simulated fighter crafts? I really have gotten accustomed to their comedic approach with touchy moments to these films. Kurt Russel is Chris Pratt's father?! Of wait nevermind, Ego is Peter Quill's father. Yondu has been rejected by The Ravengers due to his relationship with Peter which broke the Ravenger Code(poor guy). The Ravengers have a larger role in this movie. They really approached this film to appeal to a large range of audiences. Shiz gets real crazy and weird mid-film. I like the sister fight sequence (however now I kind of feel bad for Nebula).\nSide note: Funniest moment is when Peter says, \"I'm gonna make some weird shit\". \nEgo is a freaking maniac, WTF. Rocket actually has a bigger role in this film (maybe that is why he serves as the main character on the new GotG: Mission Breakout ride in California Adventure). Rocket also experiences a connection with Yondu. It's crazy how important the music is in these movies, there's lots of connections between the songs and the plot and also it serves as a fantastic addition to these intense and comedic movies. End fight scene gets pretty intense! I love their weapon technology.\nSide note #2: I want to be Star Lord for Halloween this year\nThis film really hints at the power and importance of a father-son relationship (Chris Pratt even stated in an interview that the script has helped him get over the passing of his father). Yondu dies and is given a Ravenger Funeral due to his actions. A really good, heartwarming ending.\n\nFirst mid credit scene is Kraglin seen practicing with Yondu's arrow, later impaling Drax with it.  \n\nSecond mid credit scene is a group of Ravengers, headed by Stakar Ogord (Sylvester Stallone) forming a team. (Possibly hinting at a Ravenger stand alone film).\n\nThird mid credit scene is very important, it is the high priestess Ayesha marveling over her creation, Adam Warlock. (To later be revealed in the next GotG installment).\n\nThe fourth mid credit scene shows us that Baby Groot has now turned into Teenage Groot.\n\nThe end credit scene is Stan Lee hanging out with the Watchers (an advanced alien race that oversees the universe), he watches as they leave and finally says, \"Wait guys, I have more stories to tell!\" (Hinting at his increasing age and the fact that he has so much more to add to the Marvel Universe).\n\nStan Lee appears in this film sitting with the Watchers as Rocket and Yondu jump space time, rudely interrupting their conversation.",

From the massive opening (pun intended) to the heartfelt ending, Volume 2 never ceases to amaze. It's just as action-packed and comedic as the first, yet absolutely holds it own on every level. Considering I've seen the first one nearly half a dozen times, something tells me I'll be doing the same with this one.

Still an exciting story with excellent motivation, baring the robotic gold race chasing our hero's. Kurt Russell's strong developed human character provides us a more grounded villain until he takes a back seat in an over blown action set piece. While the action set piece falls short of expectations Quill's emotional story excels hitting everyone in the feels and further humanizing and developing Quill as one of the strongest characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Hopefully in Vol. 3 we return to see the ensemble working together on screen doing  good, bad and a little of both.",

Presents an interesting take on child parent relations through Quill and Quill's father.  Main characters do a decent job, but one cannot help to sense they might have been a little stressed out while filming it.  Perhaps they shouldn't be on such strict schedules, not sure what was going on behind the scenes but there was a lack of passion when filming this film that is detectable from the two main actors Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana who play Peter Quill and Gamaroa respectively.    \n\nThe end of the story was very well done especially the dynamic between Peter Quill and Yondo.  This interaction had a lot of heart in it and was well acted.  The Sovereign was also a great plot idea that worked well that provided alot of amusement as strict vengeful puritans with a lust for getting people back. \n\nOverall it was a good movie, but I wish they had made the plot a little more emotionally mature.  Too many of the blockbusters in this day an age are aimed for the high school early college market of young adults that plays seemingly more to the males than the females.  This is one movie the exemplifies this trend which is the reason I am giving it 3.5 stars instead of 4.  I'm actually quite sick of the lack of real deep emotional material in films.  Surely it is possible to create something akin to Game of Thrones in space at some point right?  If you borrow this idea just remember to give me the credit!

The story bounced around a lot to keep the audience's attention, but for me it was confusing and lacked any real depth or value for the two hours I sacrificed. It looks as though this movie was just a money maker leading up to a final showdown with Thermos, or thanos or whatever his name is, which will probably occur a few movies and years done the line depending on how long audiences will put up with crap productions like this.

            "content": "Guardians of the Galaxy #Vol2 Non-Spoiler Review:\n\nLet's be honest: you can't repeat a big surprise. With Vol 1 being a massive surprise hit for Marvel Studios and the Guardians reputation to withhold, Vol 2 had every reason against it, to fail. I am happy to report as a big Marvel Cinematic Universe fan, Marvel have nailed it again. \n\nIn a nutshell it's spectacularly fun. I literally smiled and laughed out loud from start to finish. The sequel returns with true comedy that makes it funnier than it's predecessor, and it's not repeated comedy skits that we watched before, it's fresh comedy which is a credit to the script writers. \n\nWhen it takes a step away from the comedy, you start to realise they haven't sat back on the sequel. It  takes some guts to pause all action and concentrate on no less than three slow character building scenes in the middle of the film. It turns out that's working great for the characters and is one of the main reasons why the final act works fantastically. \n\nNow, onto my favourite part of Guardian's of the Galaxy - the soundtrack. In real life, Peter\u00e2??s Awesome Mix Vol 1 became a best-selling soundtrack, becoming the first soundtrack album in history consisting entirely of previously released songs to top the chart. Vol 2 does not disappoint with new added songs from artists such as Electric Light Orchestra, Fleetwood Mac, George Harrison and many more. I've been listening to the soundtrack all morning, and like the Vol 1, I can't get enough of it. \n\nIn conclusion, Vol 2 was just as great, just as funny, just as epic than the first one.  I won't lie, I saw flaws, the plot being the biggest flaw. However; James Gunn has done more than enough to have this film standing tall alongside it's predecessor and all of its brothers and sisters in the universe. You Marvel nerds out there, like me, will love it. \n\n#GuardiansOfTheGalaxyVol2",

In the end there is a sense of forgiveness and reconciliation.  I loved this movie for these important themes.  Having children through adoption, they have faced these issues and it is so good to see them played out onscreen.  I would encourage parents who have kiddos who have faced abuse or have a missing parent to make sure their kid is ready to see this kind of storyline.  Talk with them about how it felt to see Star Lord meet his dad and have to turn away from his dad.  Talk about the hurt the abuse Gamora and her sister experienced and how it wasn't their fault.  This movie is a good tool for kids who are ready for it -- just be prepared for discussion after wards.",

Baby Groot also has some of the best moments including the opening credits.\n\nThe villains is also a marked improvement on Ronan from the first film. Whereas Ronan felt more like a plot device than a real villain, Ego is important to the films story making for a much better developed and more interesting character.\n\nThe story isn't quite as strong as the first films though with some parts feeling like they are a bit padded out.

            "content": "I'm going to say something somewhat controversial: I think that Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2 is better than the original Guardians of the Galaxy. Okay, I take it back: that is very controversial. The 2014 smash-hit is lauded as one of the greatest superhero movies of all time, one of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time, and one of the greatest altogether fun movies of all time. I mean, who have you ever talked to who hasn't loved the original Guardians of the Galaxy? Me, if I've ever talked to you about it. \n\tIt's not that I disliked the first film. That would border on blasphemy. It's just that everyone saw it as something fresh, something new, but as for me, it was really just a retread of Star Wars, albeit with more fun and humor. I would give it a solid three stars. I must say, though, this film caught me by surprise. Sequels, as everybody knows, are generally not as good as their predecessors. Of course, there are notable exceptions to this; The Dark Knight, the Empire Strikes Back, Terminator 2, Mad Max: Road Warrior, to name a few. But, as the general consensus goes, this was definitely not considered to be better than the original. In fact, one of the main points of criticism for this film (though it got good reviews) was that its inferiority to the original. Sorry, but I disagree. \n\tGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 reunites the cast from the first; Chris Pratt as Peter Quill, Zoe Saldana as Gamora, Dave Bautista as Drax, Bradley Cooper as Rocket, and Vin Diesel as, this time, Baby Groot. James Gunn returns to direct, and the film centers on Quill meeting his father (Kurt Russell) and discovering who he is. Here, characters are more in the spotlight than the frantic action of the first film. We still get beautiful, incredibly colorful visuals and a few action sequences, but what's really focused on is the nonlinear plot and complex characters. \n\tBy the end of the film, we are taken to emotional heights that I genuinely did not expect. It's not that it's more emotional than I ever expected it to be per se; what surprised me was the way in which the film achieved these emotions, with a twist that I never saw coming and that was more satisfyingly emotional than anything I've seen in any movie in recent memory. When the history books are written for 2017 in film (as if they have those), Logan will obviously be the superhero movie most lauded and remembered, but I think this is definitely a superior film. In Logan, the emotions that we feel at the end were inevitable; we saw what was going to happen coming a mile away, and felt more like a clich\u00e9 from a film like Despicable Me than anything genuinely emotional. Here, you really don't see coming how the film deals with the characters in a poignant and touching way, which makes it all the more special. \n\tThe things that I enjoyed from the first Guardians are certainly here; action, visuals, music, humor, and great characters, except characters are given more focus than the action, and the touching ending makes the first movie's \"emotional ending\" feel shallow and insignificant by comparison. I can see why people don't like this as much as the first; it's not as fun and the action is more far and few between, but to be honest, I enjoyed the breaks from action to get more in touch with the characters. The film doesn't take these positive attributes far enough to be considered great; Gunn has action, humor, and characters nailed, but emotional sequences still need some work. He gets it very well in this film though; so hopefully by the third installment he'll be able to deliver one of the greatest superhero movies ever made. Based on this impressive second installment, I think it's well within his grasp.\n\n--\nRating: 3.5/4",

You also get a lot of character development across the board and the resolution is handled solidly (a little over the top I guess, but it fits the movie). It was visually beautiful and the humor was mostly effective, especially from Drax, but the action could sometimes be hard to follow.

            "content": "Set to \"Awesome Mixtape #2\", Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. #2  is more thrilling and hilarious than its predecessor. It is an action packed, sci-fi adventure about a group of intergalactic criminals who are tasked to work together to save the universe. Chris Pratt again stars as Peter Quill, aka Star Lord. The rest of the cast follows suit - Zoe Saldana as Gamora, Dave Bautista as Drax, Vin Diesel as the voice of Groot and Bradley Cooper as the voice of Rocket. \n\nThe film starts out with the classic 70s song \"Brandi\" by Looking Glass as we see two young people driving down the highway, very much in love. We later learn that this is the back story of Peter's conception and is foreshadowing the main storyline of the film. The movie jumps 34 years and Peter is now Star Lord, captain of a band of reformed outlaws. The group is hired to guard the uber batteries of the Sovereign planet. Upon leaving, Rocket steals some of the batteries and a space battle ensues. Star Lord and his crew are shot down and make an emergency landing on a nearby planet. Before landing,  they notice a mysterious spaceship, which takes out the entire Sovereign fleet pursuing them. The rest of the film is an emotional, action-packed adventure, having to do with this mysterious personage. There are lots of battles between different factions in this crazy sci-fi, fantasy universe.  \n\nThe movie has lots of lively and entertaining scenes. My favorite is when Rocket Raccoon uses traps to his advantage to defeat an incoming horde of ravagers. Every scene with Drax is terrific because he has a different philosophy of life and has the most infectious laugh of any character in any movie, ever. I also love how Peter is obsessed with 80s pop culture.  He references them all the time, but his companions never understand them, because they didn't grow up on Earth. I especially love how 80s music is used to evoke nostalgia from Peter's childhood, making for a terrific oldies soundtrack.\n\nOverall, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is phenomenal and full of whimsical jokes that don't get old. It is a perfect family adventure that is suitable for ages 10 to 18. Parents and grandparents will even get a kick out of it. I rate this film 4 out of 5 stars for its engaging humor and captivating action. \nReviewed by Clayton P., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews by youth, visit kidsfirst dot org.",

Chris Pratt, Dave Bautista, Zoe Saldana, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, and Michael Rooker gave more of a story to the characters we love already. They also gave them more heart. Kurt Russell did excellent portraying Ego the Living Planet. He was portrayed really well compared to the comics. The soundtrack was stellar as the last one. Slightly less star filled, but still an excellent soundtrack. This film felt well paced, a little better than the first film. The action was all through the film, a little more than the first. The laughs were spread out also. The writing of the script was well done, they really felt like a bickering family. The special effects were cool. A lot of neat shots. This film also had some sad moments, leading to some possible tears from the audience. Overall, this film is on par with Marvel's best films. A little better than the first even though the first is excellent. Definitely check this film out. \n\nRating: 9.1/10",

Questions are answered and more questions rise as the audience cannot wait for Vol.3. Marvel continues to amaze me with their writing and editing.",

It fails to live up to its expectations and the plot feels VERY disconnected from the rest of the Marvel Universe, something that at this stage is really not good. It also has probably the highest stakes than any Marvel movie before, but it doesn't feel like it and, between joke and joke, you can't really take this threat seriously. But the humor in this movie is better than in most of the other Marvel movies, even if it's still kind of obvious, silly and not smart at all. The performances from the Guardians are the best of the movie and definitely what makes this adventure so enjoyable. And it has one of the best opening sequences of any superhero movie ever. But, although it doesn't live up to the freshness of the original, it is a highly entertaining movie and another great entry to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",

            "content": "The long awaited sequel to the break out hit, Guardians of The Galaxy, is here! In 2014, the Marvel Studios original came out of obscurity to set box office records, introducing fans to a cast of heroes who aren't exactly your typical superheroes. Combining amazing special effects and comedy, the film quickly gained a cult following and critical acclaim, but can they defeat the biggest enemy of all, the curse of the sequel? The Guardians are back doing what they do best, with a new enemy on their tail, when they crash land on an uninhabited planet. Their rescuer comes in a form of a man who seems too good to be true, is he really there to help them or does he have something else in mind? The story in volume two is not as good as the first one, that was to be expected, but luckily it isn't far off. The characters are the same and this time they know each other a whole lot better, meaning the chemistry is better, the humor comes more quickly, and the magic is still there. Once again Chris Pratt is outstanding, it's still hard to believe he went from the annoying jock on Everwood to this charismatic megastar. The rest of the cast is also on it's game and we learn much more about the characters then we did in the first film. While not being as strong story wise, this film certainly hits closer to home, and everything is amped up from the special effects to the humor and even the soundtrack. I love these films and I hope there are a lot more of them, however I'd be remiss in not sharing my thought that something this good, especially with how the story evolves in the second film, is better suited for a weekly TV series than at most a handful of feature films. The Bottom Line, if you liked the first one, you'll love the second one.",

This film can somehow capture the magic of its predecessor and build on it in many ways, but the film does struggle to get its feet off the ground throughout the first act and takes until the start of the second until you start to see which direction they are going with it. The performances are all great and somehow your love for these misfits grows stronger. Especially for the character Yondu. His character impressed me and I couldn't have imaged a better way they could have developed his character from in the first film. One of the most important features in the first film is it's incredible soundtrack and this film builds on it and James Gunn chose tracks that flowed with the scenes and added a lot of depth to them. Overall I had a fantastic viewing experience and am extremely excited to see what they do next to this beloved franchise.",

I enjoyed a lot of the relationship development, although as much as I love the Drax delivery of lines, there were a few that fell a bit off for me, however by the end I was sold on his & Mantis' friendship. Very interested to see how Gamora & Nebula develops, but less interested in Gamora and Peter. Oh and Baby Groot was as adorable and brilliant as expected.",

So much of it relied upon the surprise factor; the unknown characters, the quirkiness and quite frankly the utter absurdity of a walking tree and talking racoon. Thankfully the sequel retains the banter, the repartee and a host of great one liners. The underlining story however is weak and pretty predictable. Sure it serves a purpose in filling in some Starlord backstory but it can't quite match  the same retro-satisfaction of the original. Instead the surprise here is that Gunn produces a Marvel film with a heart as big as the heroes' biceps. Significant time is spent on the emotional journey of all the central characters, with numerous moments of pathos and reconciliation. The directorial generosity Gunn shows in allowing his ensemble to all had sufficient screen time to have a genuine emotional revelation is unheard of in this genre. So whilst GOTG2 doesn't hit all the same notes as the first film, it hits enough new ones with sufficient originality to make it worth the ride.",

And don't even get me started on yondu they made him sooooo much more amazing like he was in the comics they made him look and feel more like the comics.

From the banter that felt forced and was rarely funny to the meandering plot that was nothing more than vacationing with daddy until 3/4 through the film, Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2 tries way too hard to ride the waves of the first movie. You can see this from the dance opening only with Groot this time, or the halfhearted attempt to develop a relationship between Starlord and Gomorra wherein at one point they literally break the 4th wall to joke about how bad the ratings would be if they discussed said mutual feelings. Not worth the money. I'm shocked at the high reviews it's received, when the only redeeming quality was it's very good special effects. You can't call a book good no matter the how pretty the cover or whether the previous novel was amazing: let Vol. 2 stand on its own two feet and you'll see it crumbles quickly into a cascade of bright colors, bland humor, and not much else.",

The movie lost much of the comedic elements from the first movie, but I won't say it wasn't funny. There were plenty of hilarious moments, the best one being \"I'm Mary Poppins, y'all!\". And I, for one, love end credits scenes, but there being five seemed like an overkill. Finally, the Stan Lee cameos being explained was just a fan service and an unfortunate wedge in the real meat of the story. All in all, it wasn't a bad movie, but it was disappointing nonetheless.

Rooker's performance as Yondu was easily the best part of the film. He gave a surprising terrific performance in this film. Kurt Russell's performance as Ego was very intriguing and the story arcs in this film were really handled well. That being said, this film definitely had its flaws. The pacing during the first act was very cluttered and choppy at times. It did not blend smoothly like the 1st movie did. I thought the Sovereign in this movie were just plain out annoying. They were extremely weak villains and they really had no purpose being in this film. Elizabeth Debicki's performance as Ayesha was very disappointing. She was very bland and generic. To be fair, she was not given much to work with. Dave Bautista's Drax had some of the best comedic lines, but unfortunately he did not get any character development added to him at all besides one very brief scene. His character was a very formulaic laugh and one-liner guy. Despite some of my flaws I had with this film, I still thought Guardians of the Galaxy 2 was an extremely fun popcorn movie with beautiful visual effects, great comedy, good acting, intriguing characters, and good overall themes.",

You can be laughing one minute but crying the next. This movie is entertaining and even adds more character development towards our main crew and Peter Quill and his Father. This movie was entertaining throughout the whole thing. It was amazing, but the problems with this movie includes characters that don't need to be in there such as the Soveriegn people which don't need to be added, but are included for a sequel, I also believe Sylvester Stallones character is not needed either he shouldn't even be in the movie. And some jokes do fall flat and there are some dumb scenes that kinda ruin a really cool scene, but they always seem to come back after a problem with a joke or dumb scene. This movie is a 9, for the unnecessary characters and for some flat jokes and dumb scenes. But this movie is amazing and I reccomend you check it out,",

It fell victim to what a lot of sequels fall victim to. This feels more focused on one hero rather than a team.\nKurt Russell was easily my favorite part of the movie and I thought he did great as Ego. Infact, he might be up there with some of the more memorable Marvel villains. Drax... was starting to get on my nerves. I really liked him in the first but here, they should've cut some of his lines because he does not shut the hell up. I think they went overboard with Drax.\nThe movie feels dumbed down a bit, especially in the dialogue and humor, not nearly as smart as the first movie.\nSo, I give it a 7.2/10, I'll get it on Blu Ray, but I feel absolutely no rush to do so.",

The Guardians must fight to keep their newfound family together as they unravel the mystery of Peter Quill's true parentage. Old foes become new allies and fan-favorite characters from the classic comics will come to our heroes' aid as the Marvel Cinematic Universe continues to expand.\n\nAs of late, I've been real tired of the superhero genre. Marvel's recent films such as \"Ant Man\", \"Captain America: Civil War\", and \"Doctor Strange\", have all been less than adequate in my eyes. But since \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" is my favorite Marvel movie, I had some hope that its sequel would re-ignite my interest in superhero movies. Although it may not have done it to that extent, I still thoroughly enjoyed this sequel. \n\n One thing that I loved about this film was the fact that it was Marvel's first film on RED's 8k Weapon Camera, going digital in the process. As a result, this is easily the best looking Marvel movie, while also being the most colorful. If there's another flaw that all Marvel movies share, it's that they're all pretty ugly. None of them use beautiful aesthetics or color pallets due to their desire for a more realistic look, but this film breaks that mold and gives us a fantastic looking movie.\n\nThe chemistry between the cast is still one of the highlights of the series. I love the interactions between everybody and this is one of Marvel's gut busting films. I remember laughing a lot throughout this film, as its combination of comedy and story will keep you engaged throughout.\n\nThe overall screenplay was pretty fun for the most part and even emotional at times, even if the finale was an over glorified CGI throw-down that didn't carry that much meaning.  I really felt like they gave a lot of character development to the characters we already know and love, which is really important when making sequels. I'm happy with the direction that James Gunn took this film in and I'm glad I was able to watch it.\n\nIn the end, I want to keep this short and sweet, I can finally say I like a superhero film for the first time in years, which is a huge accomplishment in my mind. \"Guardians of the Galaxy 2\" is a fun time and an engaging film that I think many should see.",

            "content": "\"I kind of liked it and kind of didn't.\" - Random woman at the theater after the movie.\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is the follow-up to the smash hit of 2014 and most fans of the movie have been waiting almost 3 years for the next installment of the rag-tag team of misfits fighting space adventures. While the first movie was almost an homage to Star Wars, this movie tries to establish it's own identity by showing in more depth the makings of each team member and what makes them a family.  While the film gives fans a visually delightful space quest the majority of the story is broken up into teams (coupling) where you learn a little bit about everyone in sections but then ultimately rejoin to beat the bad guy at the end.\n\nPositives\nThe film is certainly the visuals and depth of characters. The visuals are always very well done and Marvel takes no breaks on making sure their movies are visually stunning. The characters are fairly defined, you learn a little bit more of why Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and Nebula (Karen Gillian) are so hateful towards one another, why Drax (Dave Butista) feels soo close to his new friends, and the meat of the story... who Starlord's father is. Those moments when you learn a little bit more about the characters are very well done but the execution is lacking in putting together a proper storyline.\n\nNegatives\nSadly the pacing of the film and how the story of each character is revealed. There is a lot of stops and go, jumping from one storyline to another sacrificing pacing and smooth transitions into another characters moments. While you have a touching moment with Starlord (Chris Prat) with his father Ego (Kurt Russell) the movie will then jump away to another characters mission on a completely different planet. While it is understandable when you consider that James Gunn had to balance not only the main core of the Guardians but also have them interact with new characters and try to flesh them out and make them memorable for the audience to have an emotion bond with them. Had the movie decided to focus more on fewer than more, it could be said that the story would flow better (considering there will be a Guardians of the Galaxy 3 and 4 coming so why not spread out the stories a bit?) \n\nAnother negative of the film but most likely a choice handed down from Marvel is the overuse of jokes and comedic timing. While it is sometimes nice to recall a joke from a previous film, the film decides to throw about 10 jokes a scene at the audience hoping that majority will leave the audience laughing but rather leaves the audience a bit tired and bored. There are many examples of scenes that go a bit too long and struggled to get to the point because the act of \"fan servicing\" to fans of the original movie's humor, it will make a scene that could have been 5 minutes into 8 minutes because 3 minutes are just recalling and rehashing the same joke or pushing the same joke to a tiring point.\n\nOverall\nAlthough the film did have pacing issues, very harsh story transitions and painful overuse of humor, the film does stand on its own and is a good, not great, installment for the Guardians franchise. The film is enjoyable at more points than not but in the overall sense of entertainment, you probably won't stop and watch this film when it comes out on cable but die-hard fans of Marvel Studio films will be sure to love this to the very last scene.\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 score card\nRating: 3/5\nRewatchable: Yes\n\"Drop Everything\" factor: No\nEntertaining: Overall yes but it can get slow.",

Not only the camera direction but the dialogues as well (also, did someone noticed the \"Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagan\" quote?

When Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) crosses paths with a man claiming to be his father (Kurt Russell), he's got some soul searching to do so he can reconnect with his roots.  Now the first Guardians was such an unexpected hit, everybody wanted to see where Marvel would take the story next.  I sometimes flip on which film is my number one, but the original Guardians has always been in my top two favorite films in the Marvel universe since its release, so it is easy to see why this was most people's most anticipated movie of the summer.  When considering the entire lineup for the hot months, I will throw myself into that camp as well (although I will say it is super close with those apes that are coming in July).  After watching this, I will still give a slight edge to the first one as far as playing favorites go, but this is still a raucous good time in its own right.  Now I know this is a group effort to be sure, but I really do feel like a lion's share of credit has to go to writer/director James Gunn.  He has such an off sense of humor that he is the perfect brain behind the franchise, and really, to have a mayhem-crazed raccoon and a talking tree that can only say \"I am Groot\", you have no choice to get somebody who has a different view on comedy.  This series is one of the rare ones that does not have a noticeable drop in quality like the other direct Marvel sequels.  The track record is still pretty good, but with Iron Man 2, The Dark World and the Age of Ultron, they are mostly passable at best.  In fact, until this movie, The Winter Soldier was the only exception to the rule.  This is a series that just has a ton going for it, and that is largely due to its terrific sense of humor.  Not even dwelling upon it, I can recall three scenes off the top of my head of well executed comedy that had me rolling in my seat because they know how to setup a joke, and given the fact that we are already well aware of these characters, all it does is enhance with sharp writing that bolsters the punch line just right.  As per expected, the soundtrack to this is standout, and as soon as I heard E.L.O.'s Mr. Blue Sky highlight the film's opening credits, I knew I had a movie that was after my heart.  From a story standpoint, it takes these characters to the next logical point for developing them.  Even though the stakes are technically even bigger, it still feels light, and I still don't know if that is a critique or a compliment.  It's well over two hours and you never feel the length, and you will be hard pressed to find a popcorn movie more crowd pleasing than this one.",

Also Ego the living planet was exploered and more realized in this movie than any of the other Marvel villains outside of Loki. Drax by far was the funniest character in the movie and all of the comedy was great and hit hard. The few problems I had with the movie was everytime we tried to get a little more back story on Drax something always interrupted it.

Admit that I even zoned out for a spell in the middle-end period but rescued by the Yondu story (and yes, this saved the film to me!). Baby Groot a scene stealer, of course. Overall this appeared more like a video made to film & not the cinematic explosion I expected. Memorable performances: Michael R (Yondu), Karen G (Nebula) & the team-up combo again for Bradley C & Vin D (Rocket & Baby Groot). Closing into the Infinity Wars & hope the puzzles bridges this team a bit smoother to the others! ???????????? of 5 (3 of 5)",

However, similarly to what Empire Strikes Back did to A New Hope, the movie doesn't just live up to the previous movie, it exceeds it. The movie takes what were fun characters in the first film and expands on all of them, giving each and every one, mainly Rocket, Gamora and Quill. I was concerned during trailers and marketing that Baby Groot would be overdone and unfunny, but they actually handled him pretty well (for the most part). We, luckily, don't have another minions case on our hands. I especially like the visual flair of this movie. After all, I've always been a sucker for that cyber-space-punk style or whatever it's called. Guardians of the Galaxy does it well, except from time to time I see an overuse of CGI. One scene especially was the fight scene at the very start of the movie with the giant rathgar (it's a rathgar). I guess my final complaint would be that sometimes its tone is a bit... off? Sometimes the film gets a bit too cartoonish, to a point where I could only see kids really laughing. Two scenes in the movie stick out to a degree where characters obey cartoon physics instead of those of their actual world, which really broke my immersion. Despite these small issues, the movie is fantastic. A greater summer movie, a great Marvel movie, and most importantly, a great sequel. I hope that this practice of making expansive sequels continues in current films.",

Okay maybe it was not entirely as good as the first one but nonetheless it holds up to its expectations and even surpassing them at times.\n\nThere's just so many great things about this film: the action, the characters (except for Ego, frick Ego), the music, the visuals, the interactions between everyone, the humor, just about everything. Okay yes the main plot may have been a bit too standard for me I did not care, The Guardians of The Galaxy had once again sucked me into their world and into their very very dysfunctional sort of a family as a fan and as a child, allowing my action loving self to fully immerse myself into the movie.\n\nSo what were my favorite parts about the movie? Well okay there were a lot of things great about the movie but my favorite part about the movie as a whole would probably be the interactions between the characters and how their relationships with each other were slowly built and/or further explored and deepened (whether it was happening on or off-screen) but nonetheless still fresh and very real. My favorites of these being Quill and Yondu's relationship and the relationship between Rocket and Groot. Another prominent strength of the film I noticed was indeed the humor, it was everywhere, from scene where Quill is asking everyone for tape in the middle of the climax to nearly all of Baby Groot's lines and actions, it was everywhere and while some jokes weren't too strong the humor was overall pretty funny and helped me stay engaged.\n\nBut despite the many strengths there were a few weaknesses like those stupid gold people, they were boring as frick and didn't really add to anything until one of the mid-credits scenes (oh yeah there's FIVE total mid and post-credits scenes in the movie). Also I do wish that one or two of the weaker jokes had been taken out but nonetheless I still loved this film.\n\nIn short I would highly recommend this film to anyone, regardless on whether you're into superheroes or not, because if you like action, a well-paced plot, entertaining characters, and lots of humor then this film will be one heck of a ride.",

            "content": "After a crop of distinctly dull and tedious Marvel superhero flicks, it is refreshing to find one that is both entertaining and funny. I am so glad to see the return of this lively and larger than life band of heroes who really show the rest how a fantasy comedy should be made. There are plenty of wise cracks, many emanating from Rocket Raccoon who really carries much of the action. However this is a true ensemble piece with each of the characters being likeable and distinct. There are some great effects and imaginative settings, this is a properly crowd pleasing blockbuster which boasts a  fantastically toe tapping  soundtrack of 70s hits. This is clearly a movie made with a great deal of love for the subject matter by director James Gunn II. Here's to the next chapter.",

            "content": "'GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOLUME 2' was directed by James Gunn and stars Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana and Kurt Russell. Shortly after the events of 'Guardians of the Galaxy', the fame of the Guardians has spread throughout the entire galaxy and reached Ego(Kurt Russell), a cosmic being who has a personal relationship to one of the guardians.\n\nLet me just say that I liked the original 'Guardians of the Galaxy' but I didn't think it deserved the mass acclaim it had achieved. That said, I had high hopes for this movie due to the talented team working on it and Marvel's recent track record. I really liked this movie. Gunn has outdone himself with this movie and provided a true, character driven story with good humour, great acting and stunning visuals. The original cast of the original return to this movie and all do spectacular jobs. That said, this movie does have a few flaws. One of them is the messy action. Not to say it was poorly filmed, none of the movie was, but it just didn't feel that clean and felt like they were trying too hard to make it very grand. I do recommend this movie but I think caution is warranted due to the differences in how the story is driven. If you're a die hard fan of 'Guardians of the Galaxy', I can see you having issues with this movie but I think most people will be able to take the changes and enjoy it.\n\nIn comparison to the simple origin story presented in volume one, this movie provides a much deeper, fleshed out study of the characters and is built around them and their relationships. I really appreciate this focus and feel it definitely benefited this movie. I also really like how every line of dialogue in this movie means something and has some effect to the story. This was a really clever way to approach it and made for some really powerful and even hilarious moments. Combine this amazing change in focus with the incredible ending, and you probably have one of the best, if not the best, MCU plots we've had. Well done Gunn.\n\nMy-main-strength-with-Volume-One-was-the-incredible-cast-and-that echoes-all-the-way-through-to-this-movie. Chris Pratt is amazing as Peter Quill and the exploration of his character in this movie is excellent. That said, I think that a greater focus should be applied to other characters because I don't want this franchise to turn into 'Starlord: The Movie' over 'Guardians of the Galaxy'. Both Zoe Saldana and Karren Gillen were great as Gamora and Nebula respectively and I really loved the relationship between the two. It's rare that movies can have a genuinely heartbreaking and emotional relationship between two characters that's carried in blood not in attraction. Vin Disel is Groot. Baby Groot is one of the most adorable things in the known universe and do Disney play on this? You bet they do but any excuse to look at the little guy is as good reason as any. Also, rebel Groot. Stay through the credits just to see Rebel Groot. Dave Bautista is also pretty good as Drax and steals a lot of the scenes he's in. Granted he doesn't receive much focus but I think they've expended all the ways they can use his character anymore and that is actually kind of sad. Bradley Cooper is great as Rocket but I feel like he was wrongfully pushed aside in this movie. There is one scene involving him and Yondu(Michael Rooker) in this movie that I thought was beautiful and poetic. Speaking of Yondu and Michael Rooker, Rooker did a phenomenal job as Yondu and gave probably the best performance in the entire film. This movie made Yondu one of the best characters in MCU cannon and I think it's incredible how they did that. Kurt Russell was also pretty decent as Ego and I genuinely bought his relationship to one of the Guardians. This movie had TWO sets of villains. One set was a very weak punchline that served nothing to the plot and existed for the sake of existing. The other set was very enthralling and intriguing for the former half of the movie but loses credibility and enjoyment value as the movie progresses.\n\nTechnically speaking, this movie is gorgeous. I don't mean that lightly either. This movie is so artistically appealing and visually stunning that I admire Gunn and Henry Braham for the beautiful movie they've produced. It really takes you back to the visual wonder and amazement of watching something like 'Jurassic Park' for the first time. Both movies are completely different, mind you, but the sense of awe and wonder you feel in this movie, and incredible attention to detail reminds me of my first viewing of that movie. Top the cinematography off with amazing visual effects(courtesy of half of China) and flawless costume/set design, and you have one technically astounding movie. \n\nThe drama in this movie is also surprisingly well handled and I really bought the character conflict throughout. The laugh-to-cringe ratio was around 50/50, which isn't bad to be fair but they do hover around some jokes for WAY too long and this really reduces their meaning and humour value. As stated before, the action in this movie is really messy, except for one sequence towards the middle. \n\nThe pacing for this movie was also WAY off and didn't work in the slightest. While the music was fine, it didn't hold a candle to Volume One and was no where near as good.\n\nIn conclusion, I do recommend you see this movie and I would rate it a solid 8 out of 10. I can see some die hard fans of Volume One having issues with it but realistically the new focus of attention definitely benefited the movie and helped garner my interest back into a Marvel team I neither liked too much or cared about. Congrats Gunn, you've earned it.\n\n8/10",

            "content": "THE QUICK: If you liked the first one, you'll probably like this one. It's more of the same cuteness, sweetness, silliness that's expected. The misogynistic problem is even stronger in this movie. What's missing? The heart is kind of there, but not really. The storyline teeters a bit, and it leaves you wondering, with Marvel having problems with female representation why didn't they bring back original writer, Nicole Perlman? It made me wonder if she's the reason the script was so strong in the first movie (as my screenwriting friends vomit in their mouth at the mere mention of a genre movie being well-written. Yes, for its genre, it is). Oh, and the music isn't as finger-popping as the first movie, but then again, how can you beat a movie that opens with the Native American Indian music of a band called Redbone? But the music is still worth the price of admission.\nWHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW, IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FIRST (with slight SPOILERS of the first movie): Guardians of the Galaxy are a ragtag team of misfits and criminals who decide to do good after they saved the galaxy. They are made up of Gamora, the green girl who is a badass assassin; Groot, a plant alien who can only say, \"I am Groot.\" He started out as a huge plant but because of risking his life for others, he nearly died, only to be replanted and starting all over as a baby. Rocket, a raccoon-type creature who has been genetically modified and carries all the scars. He is able to build weapons and machinery out of basic junk parts. Drax, a gray-ish colored dude who speaks only in a literal manner -- no metaphors (though sometimes steps out of character), he enjoys going into battle and seeks revenge on the tyrant who killed his family. Peter Quill, AKA Starlord, is an Earthling who was abducted as a child after his mother died from cancer. He was raised by pirate-like aliens known as Ravagers, whose leader is Yondu. We find out at the end of this movie that Quill's father hired Yondu to bring Quill to him, and Yondu refused, raising Quill himself. We also learn that Quill is part human and part of an ancient, unknown species. THE WALKMAN and THE MIXTAPE, when Quill was abducted he had a few belongings in his backpack, which included the Walkman and a mixtape of cool music from the 80s and before (he was abducted in 1988). At the end of the movie, he finds a 2nd mixtape gifted to him when his mother died. \nCharacters continued from the first movie: Yondu, the blue dude with a cool Mohawk. A blue alien redneck with a cool mohawk who practically raised Peter Quill. Nebula, Gamora's blue sister who was raised to fight Gamora as a test of strength and agility (Gamora always bested her and their father, Thanos, considered Gamora his favorite child). Sometimes, Nebula wants to kill Gamora. \nNOW, THE REVIEW: THE GOOD/THE BAD/THE UGLY (BUT BEAUTIFUL ON THE INSIDE): Overall, the movie made for basic good entertainment. The misogyny is more prevalent in this movie. This time they bring an Asian-looking alien into the movie (complete with accent) to play the Geisha role while being told she's ugly. Also, for whatever reason, a kid movie has characters living it up on a brothel planet. First, why a brothel in a kids movie, and second, why show a character zip up his pants and putting his clothes on while surrounded by \"fembots\"? What makes it worst, after they are done with the business, the \"fembots\" turn themselves off and shut down - thus, not wasting time with any of that yucky stuff that happens after sex. In the movie's defense, Gamora does have a stronger storyline and character.\nThe overall storyline fails for a lot of people, as the theme isn't coherent and a lot of the emotions and feelings are expressed in dialogue (a lot of tell, and not enough show). The themes don't seem as strong as the first movie. Here, there are a few, but they seem manufactured. So, unless, you have daddy issues, have an absent father or have a father who has recently passed on, you probably won't be as emotionally invested. A lot of people feel that Act 2 slugs a bit, where Peter meets with his biological father and they get to know each other. I can agree with that assessment, but the pretty visuals help this part of the movie move along. \nThere are probably too many plots in the movie, so that may cause the sluggish pace. There's the plot of Yondu dealing with a mutiny, Gamora dealing with Nebula, the whole team having to deal with some gold aliens, Rocket dealing with his emotions, Drax dealing with a possible romantic connection (?), and, oh yeah, Quill dealing with an absent father who may have other motives.\nThe final act is okay, and has good hero moments, but overall, Baby Groot is what makes it so endearing and cute. What also saves the movie is that all of the characters are pretty much attractive, endearing and/or cute. \nUnfortunately, Nova Corps doesn't appear in the movie - except for what appears to be a Nova Corps space ship. They could have given Dewey Cox (AKA John C. Reilly) and Glenn Close a day for a small cameo. \nSHOULD YOU STICK AROUND FOR THE END?: If you're into that sort of thing, yes. There are some funny moments. And there are a lot of them. I think 5 was the count I heard.\nCAMEOS: A bunch: One of Stan Lee's funniest, a character showing up from the first movie, a shoutout to the original (i.e., comic book version) Guardians, and a few more easter eggs (or should I say \"cocoon\").\nMY MONDAY MORNING QUARTERBACK MOMENT: One problem with the movie is the theme of Fathers and Sons not being played out as strongly as it could have. Unfortunately, there wasn't a scene where Quill spends time with Yondu (to create a stronger point of the theme of fathers and sons). I think what would even help it is if the opening flashback, instead of showing mama Quill, it should have continued from the abduction, and given Yondu a tough-love father-like moment to show that he actually tried to be a good daddy to Quill. And we hint at the reason why he won't take Quill to his biological father. Also, the first half of the movie could have Quill and Yondu going up against each other, fighting each other, while still caring about each other, then getting separated from each other. Then, when it Yondu learns that Quill is going to find his father, Yondu wants to go stop him because he knows what's going to happen. Then, they can reconnect and have all the touchy feely moments that happens at the end. As it is now, it seems that as a main character, Quill has very little to do.\nOVERALL: It was an enjoyable flick, worth the price of admission - again, if you're a comic book nerd purist then you'll see it if it was acted out  by a bunch of penises dressed in puppet costumes. I would like a stronger story movie, but it's good enough for what it is. This tomato won't give you diarrhea.",

I laughed at the joke but that was why the movie happened? Had he not stolen those batteries for fun the movie would not have happened? That's a pretty big flaw but if you can look past that then there isn't much wrong with it.

In fact GOTG2 felt like a smaller and more character driven sequel, something Age of Ultron tried to do. If GOTG1 is a B+ movie, GOTG2 is an A- movie.  GOTG2 kept the style and tone of the first while expanding on the character stories. And thankfully, GOTG2 surprisingly didn't shove too much Baby Groot in out faces.",

Sure it has the typical Marvel-style fights, but this is also topped off with a thick (and I mean really thick) amount of hillarity and well-timed jokes. The visuals are also extremely gorgeous to look at (Marvel does love their lasers), and is really hard to look away from.

It had so many plot lines and character arcs going that it became hard for more than one or two to actually get the screen time to be interesting. Development and relationships got rushed, and because of all this,  the comedy ending up working against the movie at times. At the beginning, the joke's were awkward and the timing was off, and as the movie progressed it reached a point where the comedic tone and serious tone couldn't mix well. It wasn't until the last 30 or so minutes, after many of the plot lines were resolving, that I felt they actually started getting the comedy down and I found myself consistantly enjoying it more. It's not a bad movie, there are still some funny moments, the characters are still enjoyable, action is fun, and some great references.

I walked away from the movie thinking that deadbeat white trailer park pops, like Ego, and abusive urban black daddies, like Thanos, can transcend galactic boundaries. From me, a three star rating means that I liked it. Five stars are only for the film most phenomenal. Yes. I liked it. And despite the incredible journey to galaxy what... M5-billion?!?, moving so fast forward through the cosmos while slapping me back to the 70's with musicales nostalgia, this did not take me there. It just felt like another in a long series of endless comic book expositions, the colossal Marvel Studio set up before the real entertainment starts. That Infinity saga had better be worth the wait, or I may just turn in my hairless dome, opt in for some hair transplants, and quit being a Watcher.",

Starting off with one of the most fun and memorable title sequences in recent memory, Gunn's directing never lets up, vowing to entertain and awe us with his weird family of oddballs that you can't help but love, confirming that the 2014 hit wasn't a fluke. Having established such a quirky tone and style with the first film-some classic sci-fi adventure coupled with a classic rock 'n roll soundtrack-Gunn doubles down on this aesthetic depicting a unique vision amongst such a saturated market. The real victory for Gunn though lies in his writing, again surpassing expectations on characters that you shouldn't necessarily find all too charming (like a foul-mouthed, cynical raccoon) and is able to hit emotional heights that other filmmakers may have stumbled on. It creates a whole package of sorts-you have the action (which does get a tad redundant toward the end), you have the heart and the humor-resulting in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 a special sort of sequel. The filmmaking is inventive, the writing is sharp and the performances all shine-signifying that this second journey with the most unlikeliest of heroes is a treat to behold and a Vol. 3 would be welcome with open arms.",

It is very joke heavy and they don't always hit their mark but it's the characters that make the film work.  For me, it's Michael Rooker's character, Yondu who steals the show, whose roll is developed further in this film.\n\nVisually it's stunning and the CGI is very effective.  The technical wizardry involved in bringing characters like Rocket and Groot to life is flawless.  The actions scenes are imaginative and well put together, especially the opening scene featuring Groot dancing to ELO's Mr Blue Sky whilst the rest of the crew do battle with giant tentacled space monster is a highlight.\n\nUnfortunately, not all the characters are fleshed out.  Although the romance between Quill and Gamora (Zoe Saldana) is moved along, the story between Gamora and her sister Nebula (Karen Gilan) isn't given much attention.\n\nAs well as Kurt Russell (who is on fine form and probably would have made an excellent Star Lord had Guardians been made in the 80's) we are introduced to new characters the Sovereign, a genetically engineered race who hire the Guardians to retrieve batteries that are a source of power to their home planet, but according to Rocket are easy to steal.  We also meet Mantis (Pom Klementieff), an empath who acts as an aid to Ego and spends most of her screen time as a focus of Drax's insults.\n\nLess plot driven, and more character driven.  Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2 offers a nice mix of action, visuals and laughs to make us intrigued by what James Gunn can come up with in Volume 3 but doesn't manage the somewhat impossible task of eclipsing the original.",

            "content": "Set within the larger framework of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the 'Guardians' franchise remains a curious outlier of sorts: its deep space adventures are a peculiar fit for the capes and codpieces found in more traditional superhero yarns. That's not necessarily a bad thing; the first GOTG film was a high-octane sci-fi romp that felt fresh and original back in 2014. Writer/director James Gunn's hotly-awaited follow-up attempts to recreate the razzle-dazzle of its predecessor, and it succeeds up to a point. The returning cast proves just as loveable the second time around (with the impossibly adorable Baby Groot being the clear standout), and the movie doubles-down on the oddball humour that made their first outing such an unexpected delight. That being said, it IS possible to have too much of a good thing, and the constant barrage of quips occasionally clutters up the action. Like many filmmakers of his generation, Gunn is clearly drawing inspiration from the 'Star Wars' films here, and GOTG2's structure bares more than a passing resemblance to 'The Empire Strikes Back' with the way it splits up its heroes during its uneven middle act, along with Star-Lord's Skywalker-esque quest to develop his untapped powers under the guidance of his Celestial father Ego (played by Kurt Russell, who alternates as both the Yoda and Darth Vader of the story). Fans of the original GOTG will likely find much to enjoy with this new instalment, even if it lacks the surprise and originality of that first rambunctious adventure. Overall, this mostly-welcome sequel manages to entertain with its abundance of eye-popping FX, irreverent humour and an engaging group of characters we've actually come to care about. [P.S. Don't forget to stick around for the its (count 'em!) five post-credits scenes.]",

The concept of Ego is executed well, and some of the visual effects were top-notch (notably the 700 jumps scene and the final battle with the villain where he reforms his bones and muscles). I still can't help but feel that the film was trying a little too hard to be funny. In the first film, all the jokes seemed more unexpected and timed better, especially with Bautista's character Drax, his jokes were just a little too over done. There was a line said by Star-lord at the end that sums up how I feel in this regard: \"you shouldn't have killed ___ and squished my Walkman\"; the impact of the statement is kind of ruined by the joke. I also felt like the murder spree by the ravagers was a little unnecessary and out of taste. The music choices were ok for this one, I just felt like the soundtrack of the first film was better. I still think it was a cool movie, just that it could have ironed-out a few little things to get it to the level of the first film.",

            "content": "To be blunt, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is probably one of the best action-comedy sequels of all time and the most fun you can have in a theater right now.  It's a bigger and more fun version of the movie you liked the first time around, with a bit more gravitas and emotional involvement making it more substantial.  \n\nTo delve into plot details would take us DIRECTLY into spoiler territory, so on this occasion I will refrain.  What makes Vol. 2 and its predecessor work are the characters, including its minor ones.  Chris Pratt's Star-Lord is as charming as you remember him and has perhaps the best plotline for a Marvel hero since the Iron Man movies or Winter Soldier.  He still has amazing chemistry with Zoe Saldana's Gamora and she has quite a rivalry with Karen Gillian's Nebula.  Gamora falls increasingly into the \"straight man\" role, ironically enough.  Bautista's Drax and Bradley Cooper's Rocket Raccoon are a non-stop riot.  And oh yes, Baby Groot is even more adorable than you imagined.  \n\nThe real theme of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is about fatherhood and mortality.  Two characters in particular flesh out this theme.  First, we have Kurt Russell killing it as Ego the Living Planet (yep you read that right - the Marvel Cosmic Universe is nuts like that).  To say that Russell's work is multilayered would be a dramatic understatement.  I'm still trying to figure out his actual feelings and opinions in regards toward the protagonist and his mother, long after finding out his actual motives.  Ego is both a fun, likeable character and ambiguously terrifying and dangerous one.  In other words, he's a Greek god walking around the Marvel Universe.  The other would-be father is Michael Rooker's Yondu.  Yondu has always been a wild card, but his full character arc provides the true heart of the movie, and in the process, he steals the show.  Rooker has the right balance of grit and emotional gravitas that makes him compelling to watch and a great foil to Ego.  In fact, most of the characters on screen, both major and minor, have some kind of arc going on and they pay off in surprising ways.  \n\nThe soundtrack is the same cool mix of 70's and 80's pop and light rock, but this time it's timed more thematically with the subject matter onscreen.  The action is a bit less sloppy this time around, and the third act is vastly superior to the Infinity Stone nonsense of before.  Overall, I rate it more highly, if you couldn't tell.  This is a must see, and it will probably end up in my home video collection, which is already overstuffed.",

Kurt Russell brings charisma to the A-plot villain Ego, who could've just been another lame one-off Marvel villain. But he leaves an impression. Elizabeth Debicki as the arrogant B-plot villain Empress Ayesha provides another great foil for the Guardians. Also, there are no unnecessary forced cameos from other MCU characters.

It's funny, well directed, with charasmatic acting that delivers for the fans of the recent franchise.\n       However the week points lie in the inability to produce a a believable danger in the script. Although the film had just the right amount of humor, the overall vibe of the film didn't allow for the villans to pose a very threatening persona throughout the movie. Along with a lack of seriousness in the plot,  there seemed to be some unfinished aspects in the storyline, namely the sparse introduction of sylvester Stallone and the character youndu's past with him. Despite these weaknesses, Gurdiams 2 is wonderfully entertaining and funny. Is it overrated? Absolutely.

This movie is a clear money grab hastily thrown together without any of the elements that made the first movie so special. First of all the movie's starting point was sloppily conceived and cheaply thrown together.  Chris Pratt's heart was not in this performance. This should be obvious to anyone watching with a clear head and unbiased motivations. Third, the plot was uninteresting and meaningless albeit forced in the grand scheme of the marvel cinematic universe. It took all of 5 minutes for me to lose interest in this pointless movie and an hour in I was crying on the inside wishing I was anywhere other than sitting in front of the screen showing this putrid excuse for a movie.

Sure there are incredible visual arts and effects which blow your mind, but they are in such a rapid flow that neither your eye nor your brain can really take them in completely, and after a while your mind simply gets overflown with those overtopped, ridiculously exaggerated images and lets you watch it all more and more like a zombie. In fact, each time there weren't any explosions anymore I simply nodded off during the senseless, brain dead conversations. But the worst about this flick is, right from the very, very, very, very start, driving one extremely, horribly mad and making one absolutely annoyed, even letting you wiggle in your seat from side to side in anger, hoping it would finally finish, is that overstretched, endless, childish, puerile, trivial, ridiculous scene (are you getting my drift) of Baby Groot taking up various minutes of the opening part, which is supposed to be a fighting scene, but only shows that little annoying creature dancing in the foreground. In fact, huge parts of the movie are concentrating on the little tree, making this flick something for 3-6 year old to watch. Summary: Great FX and IT graphics, zero story, forced ridiculous, only slightly funny dialogues, and a tremendously bothersome focus on that Baby Groot character. That \"I am Groot\" phrase, which, each time, can only be interpreted by the crew to its different meanings, lost its funniness by the end of the first movie. Riding on it even into the titles at the end makes it seem quite retarded. 4/10 points",

Superman'. \nThe chemistry is super good, the action sequences were colorful and beautiful, and while the plot was more so all jokes there's a point where it gets serious and wow it was a bit jarring but it does hit you when the big twist comes out. And while there was one more character Mantis (Pom Klementiff) I didn't get to mention till now she was also funny and moments with her and Drax made the movie interesting and kinda made Drax a lovable douche lol.\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\nAs i've mentioned in the good there's A LOT of things going on in this movie...and while it worked out pretty good; it could have went the other way too and there were moments in this movie where it nearly did. I felt the emotional tones in this movie while they were good they went the way of using Jokes to get thru them instead of letting it play its course, and this happens throughout the movie at some points. I actually wanted the serious moments play out cause I personally felt that it would have made the stakes personal on most of the characters...but nope, they add comedy and then the stakes doesn't feel personal nor heightened it just feels like its placed on the back-burner for the sake of comedy. \nGoing back to having too many stories in this movie...there was too much happening and while it was easy to understand they could have made the plot more streamlined but i understand that they had to get this out into theaters and that people like me was so much expecting this movie so i won't hold it against them. \n \n\nOverall:\n\nGOTG Vol. 2 it not the lightning in the bottle that the first movie produced but it does come close second; its fun, action packed, light-hearted, and heart wrenching. \nonce again marvel hit another Jackpot and i can't wait to see these guys work with the Avengers in 'Infinity war' Good job marvel, you did it again!",

The movie tries really hard to remind you of the soundtrack it's just distracting and annoying. I really wish this movie wasn't PG-13 or tied to the MCU because there's definitely potential for a good film but with these marvel movies each one feels more like pro wrestling. We're not at the theatre to watch a good storytelling, script, or plot. We're at the theatre to see super heroes fight stuff and see them show off their moves. in the end no one important will die and it will have a happy ending.

There were also a number of visual gags that could only be seen as funny by the incredibly young, followed by admissions of uxoricide and attempted patricide.  The villains were also a mess, there being 3 disparate groups that can fill the role in this movie who have nearly zero contact with the other villains.  \n\nThe worst and most vile thing in the movie, however, was the reaction many of the characters had to a villain's name.  It was a long running \"joke\", the crux of which was watching people struggle to act like they were hilariously laughing.  \n\nThe ending of the film was good... but it is absolutely not worth it to slog through the 80% of the film that is vile enough to make you question the quality of the first movie.

While the Vol. 2 does suffer from the occasional tonal inconsistency and lack of freshness (which is a very common problem for a sequel), for the most part I had a blast watching this film. The thing I loved the most about this movie is the way writer-director James Gunn delved deep into the backstory of each guardian, making this particular installment a personal film while simultaneously making everything surrounding them bigger and louder and funnier and more visually dazzling. Not only is this absolutely exhilarating, but also emotionally very satisfying. This is the first (and hopefully the last) MCU film that made me cry. Hats off to Gunn, the cast, the crew, and everyone involved in the project. \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\" is a damn good time.",

            "content": "Marvel has made a name for itself by bringing humor, humanity, and cohesiveness to their comic book films. The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has been a juggernaut of profits. Not only are there innumerable comic book heroes to bring to the big screen, but the very nature of comic books--serialized stories--means that sequels almost write themselves.\n\nMarvel has been the king of comic book movies with films that appeal beyond the devoted Marvel acolyte to the general public, who enjoy brisk pacing, witty dialogue, and overall enjoyable, entertaining stories.\n\nMarvel has an almost infallible recipe for creating movies, and unfortunately the new Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2, while not a recipe for disaster, is a recipe for boredom.\n\nThe original Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the best Marvel films to date, taking the over-used formula for a hero--being a misfit (fill in the blank)--and turning the formula into an enjoyable, adventurous ride into the wild west of the galaxy. What made the original so compelling, lovable characters, fast-paced adventure, and humor, are unfortunately lacking in the second.\n\n\"It's Not Time to Make a Change\"\n\nOverall, the characters (and the acting) this time around feel strained and tired. Even the natural charisma of Chris Pratt (Peter Quill) isn't enough to make the character (and the rather poor dialogue) grow from where we left the character. At the end of the first film, our heroes fly off into the galactic sunset to further adventures. By defeating Ronan the Accuser, our unlikely gang of misfits have become a family.\n\nIn the second, the family is already on edge and falling apart, but the reasons for this are not explained and not believable. The differences overcome in the first film feel meaningless as the heroes bicker about who can fly the spaceship better. It's a false conflict that leads to false resolutions.\n\nWhile there are standout moments (usually centered around Baby Groot or Drax the Destroyer), the writing in this sequel is so bland it hurts. Several times throughout the film, I found myself wondering if there had been casting changes for the second film. Zoe Saldana, a memorable character from the first, blends into the background and is so mundane to be forgettable. Chris Pratt, whose charm brought Peter Quill into comparison with Han Solo or Indiana Jones and arguably opened up entirely new acting roles to the comedic actor, can't seem to pull off the magic a second time. But again, how much is the fault of the actors and how much is the fault of the writing?\n\n\"Just Relax, Take it easy\"\n\nFoundationally, the problem with this film is its plot. The plot of this film is a traditional \"find your father, realize your father is evil\" plotline, and while the first Guardians of the Galaxy had a derivative plot as well, it's other attributes made it a fine film.\n\nVol. 2, without the witty writing and stellar acting of the original, floats in the doldrums of melodrama and Daddy issues. Part of Peter Quill's charm in the first film was the tension between his ordinariness and mysteriousness. At heart, he's a child of the 80's living the carefree life of a 20 year-old in a very extraordinary environment. He's almost a Tom Sawyer type character falling into adventure with boyish charm and slyness.\n\nIn this film, Quill finds out that his father is a \"god\" who has \"phenomenal cosmic powers\" (to steal a line from Disney's Aladdin). And guess what? Peter Quill has the same power as well! But, as in most daddy-issue plots, the father is evil and the son has to make the ultimate choice: Daddy or friends?\n\nStar Wars did it better, and one can't help but wonder why, of all places to take these enjoyable characters, we had to end up in a mediocre pit of \"Luke, I am your father\" cliches? This film is only 15 minutes longer than its predecessor, but it feels much, much longer.\n\n\"You're still young, that's your fault\"\n\nThere are plenty of enjoyable moments in this film, and there are moments that will make you smile. But the magic of the first film is not in its sequel, and overall the film is just another average action movie.\n\nIn the end, one wonders if the original Guardians of the Galaxy was an accident? A fluke of a more obscure comic book tale hitting a grand slam by happenstance?\n\nI don't think so.\n\nInstead, Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 suffers from a broader problem that Marvel is beginning to have. After so many films, characters, connections, and future sequel plans, Marvel has gotten caught in its own mammoth web. How can Marvel, with nearly a decade and 15 released films to its name, bring new stories, characters, and ideas to the big screen? How does one release film after film, in the same universe, without characters and plot-lines repeating one another?\n\nThe problem, of course, lies even deeper in that Marvel is a subsidiary of Disney, who is having a nearly identical crisis with its other subsidiary Pixar (see Christopher Orr's wonderful explanation of Pixar's slow death spiral at the Atlantic). With the end of Phase Three coming soon, can Marvel bring something new to the table?\n\nFor more movie reviews, visit my blog: themoviesnobblog.com",

            "content": "We've seen more than our fair share of Marvel movies, the last being the psychedelic and egocentric \"Doctor Strange.\" But if you think of a ragtime team of quirky misfits, only one series easily rises to the top. Kicking off the first of three MCU outings to release this year, \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\" is, unsurprisingly, another surefire hit. Banding together Star-Lord, Gamora, Drax, Rocket and Baby Groot, it's a welcome reunion of unrestrained comedy and adventure. Known ubiquitously as the 'Guardians,' we find our heroes tasked by a group called the 'Sovereign' to protect valuable batteries from an inter-dimensional creature.  Like its predecessor, the film thrives on classic oldies, some intentionally less familiar than others. But this time around, Gunn opts for slower ballads, in turn missing a level of energy that emboldened the first one. Fortunately for us, the humor remains intact, utilizing each character to the best of their strengths, or in some cases, their weaknesses. Despite a cynical raccoon (aka \"trash panda\") and newly reborn tree being, the funniest of the bunch is none other than Drax the Destroyer. David Bautista is an irrepressible riot, becoming the bedrock that coincidentally unifies the characters. As relations are ultimately tested and frayed, 'family' becomes the overarching thematic, particularly for our lead hero. Kurt Russell joins the cast as Quill's (Star- Lord) father Ego, a seemingly remorseful yet powerful being. With motives unknown and a strained reconciliation, the film gradually becomes a retrospect of father and son. As a result, it's a slower build-up than before, spotlighting again the problem with most Marvel flicks: uninteresting villains. But Gunn makes up for it with spectacular visual effects, expanding the unexplored universe with colorful imagination. The aging effect, notably, is probably the best we've seen yet, and a stellar indication of just how far we've come in technology. While \"Vol. 2\" may not be the superior sequel that we hoped for, it definitely substantiates it's not just a one hit wonder. Note to the wise: hang tight until the very end to be treated by not 1, not 2 but 5 end credit scenes. (Thanks James Gunn.)\n\nhttp://cinemadex.blogspot.com/2017/05/guardians-of-galaxy-vol-2.html",

Definitely a rollicking good time!  It was best when I saw it first as a double feature when it first opened since the audience was all fans of Guardians.  They got all the jokes, laughed out loud and sometimes added a few themselves!  I saw it the second time without a large audience and they were very reticent about laughing out loud!  I do not think they got all the jokes!  At least there were sniffles n tears at the right places!  LOVE this movie!  A must see in 3D and DBox!  Worth the money!",

The villains were NOT intimidating or entertaining to watch at all. If anything the villains were the only boring part about this movie. \n\n And third, no this sequel is definitely not better than the first GOTG, mainly because the villains are boring and the plot sometimes loses its focus.

A parent in one of the reviews I read was ok with it because she said it's the same as the language her kids come home from school with.

All the other cast members did a great job too. Kurt Russell was convincing as the nice guy turned villain. Everyone laughed at Hasselhoff's cameo, priceless. Baby Groot was cute, but I'm glad they didn't go over the top with him, which would have cheesed it up too much. The music was awesome, reminding me of my youth. \n\nSo what didn't I like? I thought the climax was a bit dragged out, and I was sorry to see a character that got a whole lot more interesting, die and then the cheese was briefly poured on. Nothing that would ruin the movie, mind you. Looking forward to the 3rd installment. The whole cast can write their own tickets.",

The first movie was funny because it was natural and unexpected.  The blas\u00e9 story did not help forward the story other than to give nearly every character more background. The problem with that is that they it was rushed due to the choice to allowing a majority if the characters face time.  The most painful part if the movie was Drax. There is a big turn around of his character in that he is the comic relief. All the jokes and laughs concerning him was hard to watch or even believe as a part if his character. Baby Groot also had many screen despite the fact that the character had no advancement in story. He served as a fan service and sell Baby Groot merchandise.  The best thing in this movie was Yondu and his relationship with Quill. I wish they would have explored that relationship more instead of cramming a bunch of relationships in one movie. It would have been nice to know that there was more faith in the franchise that it has more chances to tell the other peoples story.  Still, not the best movie but enough entertainment to enjoy the movie. Not for the laughs, but the action and the very well written part of Yondu and Quill.",

It's not your typical superhero movie that's for sure. The action sequences were all amazing, and there is some kind of character development and all but this movie's weakest point was its plot.

Yes, it's well done, and lots of money has obviously been spent on it, but I can't help but feel sorry for the actors. They don't see this stuff! They stand in front of green screens and yell at placards. Definitely takes talent, though.\nAnd then you have the overuse of pop songs and such playing throughout different scenes of the movie. I get what they are going for, but it's overdone. WAY overdone. \nThen we have the long played out Groot thing. It really feels like this baby Groot character was created just to sell toys. Especially to sell a \"Dancing Baby Groot with hip swaying action!\". \nI found the whole Daddy issues storyline incredibly cliche, as it's been done so many times before. We all knew exactly how it was going to play out right from the start. \nThe best Characters remain Gamora and Nebula. It would be fun to get more story on these two. Gamora is so much more badass than Peter Quill. She should be the de fact leader of the Guardians, not him. \nSpeaking of Chris Pratt...\nThere is just something about him I don't like. He has this smug look about him. His goofy face. His weirdly buff dude physique that doesn't seem to fit with the character, nor even the actor. It would be better to have a more normal looking(body-wise) geeky-type guy in this role, not a typical buff super hero. Maybe he just figured Marvel super heroes = muscle dudes, so he spends hours in the gym. It's just weird.  Plus, I just don't like Pratt in any role I've seen him in. \nThe humor is ok, although much of it is forced. Plus, I hate teenage boy style humor, and there's plenty of it here. \nIt's still decently entertaining which is why I give it up to 2.5 stars.

Marvel has been on such a roll over the past few years and I'm sorry to tell the haters: They're not out of gas yet. I knew it would be funny from the trailers, but the humor hits you in different ways from the monumental to the subtle. It's sci-fi action that succeeds because of the funnybone at its core. For the most part it never takes itself too seriously.\n\nAgain, the trailers left me with certain expectations, one of which being that I had seen a good chunk of the good parts. Not so in the least. In fact, you remember that trailer scene where the Guardians are battling it out on the platform with the massive space monster? Yeah, that's just the first ten minutes. The movie is jam-packed with cool surprises that keep you on your toes even as the credit rolls. My lips are sealed, but be sure and stay on the lookout at all times for cool easter eggs.\n\nI'll get off my praise horse for a moment to address my one gripe. While the film was excellent bordering on brilliant at times, I thought there were other times where it tried too hard. There were a handful of sentimental moments that were over the top reminding me of something I might find on a Lifetime movie. Gunn was forcing it, just as he found himself doing with a handful of the jokes that tried a little too hard to be funny. In his defense, there are few movies that get this completely right. In a film that feels like a walking punchline, there's bound to be jokes that fall flat. Not to mention it's better to try to hard than look like you never really tried at all.\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 succeeds without there being any kind of plot to drive the ship. The cast's familiarity with each other shines onscreen. You have a better feel for these guys this time around which makes their actions and dialogue even funnier. Everyone will rave about how awesome and cute Baby Groot was, but I personally think that Drax steals the show this time around. He's over impulsive and his decisions tend to drive the direction of the group, mostly in directions they never wanted to go in the first place. The blunt way he puts things will leave you cracking up.\n\nNot quite as good as the first, but still a strong sequel. I give it an 86.",

Volume 2 gives extra detail to the side characters such as Yondu, Nebula, and Mantis which is very refreshing, but some of the main characters like Drax, and to an extent even Peter Quill seem to coast on the first films popularity. Despite the unevenness of the film it does find room to surprise you from time to time. Michael Rooker as Yondu gives a show stealing performance, and Baby Groot is every bit as entertaining as you'd expect. For every triumph this movie has (The laughs, Supporting characters, ect.) there are just as many mistakes (The underutilization of Zoe Saldana & Kurt Russell, and those god awful golden people... to name a few). Though this movie is hovering around average on a broader film standpoint, if we just compare it to the outstanding track record of the past MCU movies, it's underwhelming to say the least.",

            "content": "IT'S THE SAME OLD SONG - My Review of GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL. 2 (3 Stars)\n\nI'm gonna keep this one real short.  Anyone who has read my prior reviews know how much I loathe comic book movies.  Sure, there's a place for them in our pop culture, and obviously the rest of the planet seems to flock to see them, but for me, even when they're well-made, I just don't care.  Even at their best, I completely forget what I've seen the minute I leave the theater it happens.  \n\nGUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL. 2, like its predecessor, is very well-made.  It's fun, fast, often hilarious, looks like a cotton candy factory exploded, and has a ton of the K-Tel hits you've come to expect from such an enterprise.  James Gunn is the right choice to direct and co-write these movies.  He loves watching THE BACHELOR, y'all, so he clearly has a taste for kitsch.  Even the cast seems to be having a good time, with highest scores going to Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper, Chris Pratt, and especially Elizabeth Debicki in the uptight, Tilda Swinton role.  STILL, I don't remember a second of it.  Thankfully I took some notes.  Rather than recap the film, which every single person on the planet will see anyhow, I'm just going to present my bullet points and call it a day:\n\n-The music is a fun treasure trove, with BRANDY by Looking Glass and ELO's MR. BLUE SKY used in the thrilling, funny and adorable opening scene being the high points. \n\n- Chris Pratt looks really good and STILL makes me ask, \"How the hell did anyone see his physical potential when he played chubby Andy Dwyer on PARKS AND RECREATION?   He always had great comic timing and continues to here, but whoever said he's gonna be hot some day deserves 10% of his money.\n\n- I'm wondering by now if Zoe Saldana is ever going to succeed in a movie where she isn't painted green or blue.\n\n- Dave Bautista must have studied playground bullies while preparing for his role as Drax.  He has the point-and-laugh down pat and comes close to stealing the movie.\n\n- Bradley Cooper, as he did in the first one, DOES steal the movie as Rocket, the highly expressive, ornery raccoon.  If I'm going to remember anything from these films, it will be how perfectly his face crinkles when he's annoyed. \n \n-To portray him as younger, the CGI work on Kurt Russell's face is incredible.  He truly looks exactly as he did when he made ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK.  Hey Kurt Russell!  Make another ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK!  Instead of the reported reboot, just bring back Kurt as Snake and power-spray his face with all that computer goodness. \n\n- Baby Groot is as cute as you would hope him to be, although he looks a little dead in the eyes as if he were possessed by those stupid Engineers from PROMETHEUS.\n\n- Sylvester Stallone makes an appropriate cameo, but he's sadly upstaged by another surprise guest star who fits right into the zany spirit of the film.\n\n- Michael Rooker brings the fun, but am I the only one who feels like he wandered off the set of BATTLEFIELD EARTH? \n\n- That uptight alien race amused me and caused me to scribble down, \"CIS-ESQUE GENDERED GOLD PRIVILEGE\".  Make of it what you will.  Side note, shouldn't all wars be fought with remote controlled drone-like space pod, silver marble thingies?  \n\n- This is as good as a Marvel movie is going to get, and yet all I can think about is how much I can't wait to see THE LOVERS with Debra Winger and Tracy Letts.  May 27th can't come fast enough!",

In this short he has managed to capture all the most important parts of the original making it more interesting and dynamic.\n\nThe first Guardians of the Galaxy was pretty much a 10 for me. I thought it was one of the funnest movies I had seen. Only being outdone by the Oscar wining film known as Birdman (which I watch once ever year). It is very naturally written and paced also extremely well. It was such a great film that was always going to be nearly impossible to outdo.\n\nAnd in some ways it is better.\n\nVol 2 manages to give development to one of the lesser characters in the last film known as Yondu Making him a lot more interesting and a lot more dynamic as well. You come to care foe Yondu as a person.\n\nThe relationship between Peter and his father is also very well done and has a lot of heart.\n\nAnd for the first time ever the Marvel movies actually manage to make a really amazing and captivating villain who matters!! This film also has a legitimate death in it. James Gun has done it people. He has broken the Marvel formula!!!\n\nSadly it is still to the defeat of the ensemble feel of the first one as the rest of the cast while still great and fun aren't being as highlighted as they were in the first one.\n\nThe jokes are more like Age of Ultron jokes with a few being really funny.\n\nAnd the final act of the film feels like every superhero movie ever.\n\nOverall though Guardians of the Galaxy is still a fun movie that you will still very much enjoy despite some of its flaws.",

Big fan of both, but v2 just had so much more.\n\nI don't go to Marvel movies expecting to have profound emotional experiences, but this movie gives you all the feelings. I mean I really felt all the things. The jokes land, the tears are properly jerked, the vengeance scenes are satisfying (-ly mirderous), and the beautiful moments are just beautiful. Also, I always appreciate when the seemingly obligatory overdone/forced romance stuff is left out. GoGV2 does a good job of keeping those elements as undercurrents. Of course the visuals are phenomenal. Personally, even among all the colorful and dynamic eygasms going on everywhere all the time, the young Kurt Russell stuff was just PERFECT. Its obviously really hard to cg real human faces (see Jeff Bridges in Tron) but this was simply seamless. \n\nNot 100% flawless, it was a little obvious at times, and a few character motivations and plot driving exposition left a bit to be desired (looking at you, Ego), but the obvious parts were still well delivered and the plot/character development flaws were minor.\n\nMy biggest complaint (not sure if this counts as a spoiler. But just I'm case.... Sort of spoiler alert) is the use of ANOTHER giant amorphous blob of evil and destruction in a superhero movie. Galactus, Parallax, Dormamu, I'm sure there are more examples, and now this. Can we not do that anymore?",

The plot of this sequel is scattershot, but I get the impression that this was a deliberate choice on the part of writer/director James Gunn. This movie has plenty of badinage, action, adept soundtrack choices, and visual spectacle, but the focus tends to remain on characterization; this gives Dave Bautista, Karen Gillan, Zoe Saldana, Bradley Cooper, and Michael Rooker plenty of moments to shine. I guess it's debatable as to whether this movie completely recreates what made its predecessor such a fun ride, but (in my humble opinion) I'd say that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a rare case of a Marvel Studios sequel properly recapturing and expanding upon what made its cast of characters so appealing in the first place.",

            "content": "It's finally here! I was a huge fan of the first Guardians of the Galaxy, like most people. So, I was super excited to see the sequel to one of my favorite marvel films. And I am happy to say that this film delivers. Is it as good as the first though? I don't think so. But that does not mean that this movie is fun as hell. Firstly, the positives: the characters. Director James Gunn knows how much the audience responded to the characters in the first film so he chose to make these characters even more developed and even more likeable in this film. Peter Quill, Drax, Gamora, Rocket and BABY GROOT are all.... perfect. Gunn gave even more background to these characters that makes them even more interesting than they were in the first film. Another positive is the comedy. This movie is very funny. There are some jokes that do fall flat and sometimes feel forced. But most of the time the comedy lands. Especially with Baby Groot. He steals the show every scene he is in and is the cutest thing ever. The action is fantastic in this film. The opening scene in this film is worth shouting out for being one of the best scenes in the film and incredibly well shot and incredibly funny. The last positive that I have is the addition of a few characters. Kurt Russell is in this film. I'm not going to say who he is just in case you stayed away from information, but all I say is he is great. It's freaking Kurt Russell. He's awesome. And one of my favorite characters form the first film Yondu, gets more time to shine and he is SO GOOD in this film. He was so badass and just so cool. As for negatives, like I said earlier, I feel that some of the comedy didn't work as well as the first film. And my biggest negative for this film is aspects of the story. I think that Vol 2 does not have as strong as a story as the first. Sometimes weighing the film down. And last negative, I had the same problem with the character of Nebula in this film that I did in the first. I think Karen Gilan is not good as that character and think she is very over the top in every scene she is in. But other than that, I think this is a great sequel. Lastly, I was endlessly impressed with James Gunn's directing because I was surprised to see that this film is very emotional. Towards the end there are a lot of scenes that I got an emotional punch in the gut from. 8/10",

Anyone who criticizes it for not being just like the first is missing the deeply layered character work that is going on here that is just as thrilling and builds the excitement of the action scenes even more. The moments of strong emotion highten the other emotions by showing the audience contrast. For example, it was interesting to see how jovial Drax is here which is a testament to his relationship with the Guardians. Perhaps he was more like this before his family was massacred but those events made him the dour creature he was in Volume 1. And it made the moment he was sad makes it even more so. So I guess you could say I loved it.",

            "content": "The crass and lovable Guardians return in a more self aware and cartoonish sequel that delivers big laughs and surprising character moments.  The cast as a whole has some fantastic chemistry, with each main character dishing up some incredibly memorable moments of snappy comedy (Yondu steals the show with his classic reference) as well as some heartfelt moments as well that balance the adventure nicely.  \n\nI'm not as big of a fan of the decidedly more cartoonish humor, as it really feels somewhat bizarre despite how irreverent GotG already is at times.  I can appreciate, however, the times when Guardians gets weird with it's world-building as it still features some of the strangest and creative fiction visually - its neon soaked landscapes and bizarre alien cultures/species make it a feast for the eyes.  \n\nThe plot revolves around Starlord and the gang meeting Peter's Dad, discover more about Peter's past, shake up the ravager fleet, and once again save the galaxy.  It's a decidedly more focused plot as compared to the first, and it has some juicy twists in the latter half (along with some comedy gold too).  It's also way weirder as compared to the almost grounded original.  \n\nAnd what of the \"Awesome Mix Vol. 2\" music selection?  I didn't feel that it was as strong and as perfectly integrated into the film as the first, but man are there some excellent picks throughout.  \n\nThe original is a tough act to follow as it had the element of surprise on its side.  Despite falling into the expected trappings of sequels, it's weirder and more creative than the first - not better - but still a wildly good time with some of my favorite Marvel characters.",

            "content": "Showtime, A-holes. The MCU is back with the weirdest, most bizarre, and out there comic book films to ever come out. That also includes Howard The Duck. And it has a lot to live up to given how everybody was waiting with abated breath to see if Guardians Of The Galaxy would live up to the insane hype that included a wise cracking raccoon and a sentient 8 foot tall tree that says three words. Well the MCU once again hits another one out of the park with an even stranger film but with everything that everyone loved from the first. With new, interesting characters, uproarious humor, shocking twists, heartfelt moments, engaging character development, and explosive action, the Guardians are back to show comic book movies and summer blockbusters in general how to do fun and have fun while doing it. These bunch of A-holes are just what the doctor ordered.\n\nWe finally embark on yet another adventure with the biggest and our favorite screw-ups this side of the cosmos, the Guardians Of The Galaxy. They're still the same idiots and lovable losers as before but now with the responsibility of being tasked with taking on the galaxies hardest tasks and fearsome creatures. Set six months after the events of the first film, though closer together with time and experience with one another, they are still miles apart in other areas. Which makes the overall aspect of this would be family that much more engaging. Even with their criminal records expunged at the hands of the Nova Corps, they still can't resist from giving in to their past habits. This makes sense from a story standpoint since it hasn't been that long since Guardians Of The Galaxy. One shouldn't expect them to change immediately overnight even if it comes at the risk of losing their lives. It makes for an overall more entertaining movie as the internal squabbles and arguments that encompass the film has more meaning overall by the time it ends.\n\nThe group's selfishness and ability to trust one another in the first movie lead to disastrous results at the behest of their overall goal. By the time the film ends, you buy that they are all friends and really care for one another based on their overall growing experience. While the group isn't trying to kill one another, there are still issues to be had and arguments that continue to fervor. The movie doesn't forget that these people have many problems and have done terrible things, leading to major repercussions. It doesn't paint them with a single broad brush but with added dimensionality that makes them stand out among other comic book characters. It's a testament to James Gunn's writing that he can wring out that much more emotion and heft from these characters after delving in so much in the first film. There is a progression that feels natural even if one has seen some of it before while still being able to surprise at the same time. Gunn didn't simply rehash the emotional beats of the first film; he explores other themes that weren't able to be covered in the first film. It makes for the perfect companion piece and sequel for allowing the Guardians Of The Galaxy to not only grow as individuals, as a team, and most importantly as a family.\n\nAnd this is what sets it apart from the Avengers and their films. The overall feeling and tone of the team feels more like coworkers sometimes than a close knit family. A lot of that has to do with the Guardians living lives of endless torment and emptiness, turning to a life of crime, and living with one another on a ship and not these individual massive egos living in different parts of the world. Given that the Avengers have argued and fought one another for three films, with a huge break up in Civil War, how they will make up to be strong enough for the mad titan Thanos while teaming up with a whole league of vastly diverse heroes is particularly exciting. This makes the eventual meeting and possible confrontation with the two superhero groups that much more tantalizing. When Infinity War comes out next year, the Guardians will have been the galaxy's protector and lived with one another for four years and that also will be interesting as such a huge time jump hasn't really been done before in the MCU between movies.\n\nThe acting from the cast was predictably great with each character, new and old, getting enough screen time to delve into their insecurities and emotions and present another side to their very complex personalities. Chris Pratt has charm, charisma, humor, and overall likability for days on end. Star-Lord's tragic past is delved into as he meets his father, a mysterious being with powerful capabilities. He also tries to woo Gamora into a more meaningful relationship while trying to keep his emotions in check while seeing the father he's never met before. I have said this previously before about Guardians Of The Galaxy, but It's a little Star Wars-esque with a roguish hero with no parents attempting to court the beautiful, strong willed warrior born from royalty who eventually meets his father under tumultuous circumstances who has unspeakable power. Like George Lucas said of the prequel films, \"It's like poetry, sort of. They rhyme.\"\n\nI really liked where they went with Star-Lord who was able to move on from his mother's death but then goes through another set of emotional problems when he meets his father. It also makes sense for the sequel to focus on him meeting his father given that Yondu and Kraglin pondered on the decision to not deliver Star-Lord to Ego like he was paid to do. Gamora is forced to be the more rational and adult of the group, questioning if a certain direction is the right way to go. Still guarded as ever with her emotions, Gamora remains ambivalent to Star-Lords pelvic sorcery, casting doubt in the future of the evolution of their relationship. All the while engaging in yet another battle to the death with her still ever so pissed off sister, Nebula. With the first film, I wanted their relationship and backstory more fleshed out and it's thankfully revealed here where you get the sick and twisted upbringing they had to endure while living under the supposed guise of normalcy by a mad titan. Nebula is one of my favorite comic book characters and she is even more so now.\n\nThe bitter rivalry, contentious jealousy, and hidden love between Gamora and Nebula were very well handled in that it didn't feel forced or sappy. You could tell that it won't ever really be all right but as long as they have each other, it will be ok. Drax The Destroyer damn well steals the whole god damn show by sheer force of will. He's even more hilarious this time around, more obtuse, and increasingly goofy to an insane degree. Rattling off one-liners with a steady, dead pan, serious delivery, he takes over a scene whether it involves the size of his shits or the unattractiveness of another woman. He always says the most inappropriate things at the most inopportune times, asking questions with a childlike wonderment. Rocket Raccoon also helps steal the show with another devastating heart to heart while being a sort of father figure to Baby Groot. I liked how Rocket can't help but act like an asshole to everyone all the while trying to keep Baby Groot in check. It presents an interesting dichotomy in character.\n\nYondu just may be the MVP of the whole movie, exploring dimensions I didn't think were there while maintaining that gruff, badass exterior. Michael Rooker has that southern redneck charm that just oozes throughout to be one of the more engaging characters in comic book movies. It's a testament to Rooker's acting who so effortlessly acted as one of the more unlikable characters in The Walking Dead as the racist, redneck asshole Merle to become one of the more interesting characters in the entire show. Not just merely a supporting character, he is crucial to the internal webbing of the whole movie and the most important emotional moments. Mantis is something completely different when it comes to these characters. Being in the employ of Ego for her entire life, she presents a naivet\u00e9 to essentially everything around her and unaware of the most basic of social conventions. And it's played very well when going off of the unfiltered Drax, someone who doesn't know much socially against someone who says whatever he feels. Pom Klementieff pulled off an amazing performance not just with her unique high pitched voice but her facial and body movements. Everything she added just made it into a vastly complete performance in so many aspects. You can't help but be engaged every time she shies away from something she said or acts in a weird way in response to something she hasn't seen or experienced before. It's the more unlikely of relationships that just further adds another bizarre, complex, and endlessly unique pairing that just makes all the more sense the longer it goes on.\n\nKurt Russel is simply put a cinematic legend and one of the greatest action heroes of all time. And it's about damn time that he was put into the MCU as the father to another action hero in Chris Pratt. Ego is an interesting character in that he is vastly different from essentially any other character in the MCU and is by far the most powerful thus far. It presents a different set of questions that separates himself from other characters in that he has such massive power and has been alive for such a long time. His ideology differs from others in such a drastic way that even when you break it down, you can understand him and maybe even sympathize with him somewhat. Russel brings his usual gruff, scenery chewing bravado that just takes over a room. He leaves an imposing trail before him where you can't help but be caught up with him. But he also can bring it down a few notches and be serious at the right moments, leaving him to be an even more imposing figure.\n\nBaby Groot once again is the best character ever regardless of his form. The best decision the MCU ever did besides casting Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man was having Groot \"die\" only to be reborn as Baby Groot. It just opens up the story possibilities that much more when one of your main characters is rebirthed in a different form. It's a clich\u00e9 that TV and film have done before but it feels fresh in this aspect. Baby Groot is by far the cutest and most unlikely character to ever come out of the MCU. It presents new challenges and ideas for not only the character but the team as the previous version of Groot was the biggest and strongest of the group, not to mention he had a more adult brain. With a smaller and more childlike Groot, it has advantages and disadvantages which makes for more comedic, cute, and inventive moments which make up some of the bets parts in the entire movie. One moment in particular just breaks your heart when you see Baby Groot being put through the wringer and you'd do anything to not see him sad or cry.\n\nAyesha, the golden High Priestess and the leader of the Sovereign people was even interesting and far more engaging than Ronan and the Kree. While not necessarily evil or even bad, they're a race of people who were born to be mentally and physically perfect. It's a good use of opening up the galaxy to different races and characters who may be introduced in future films. The Ravagers got a lot of screen time with Yondu's right hand man Kraglin getting a bigger role than before and opening up those characters to new exciting opportunities in the future. Sylvester Stallone has a really cool cameo that is very befitting of his stature as an action god. There is also an amazing brief cameo from an 80s icon as well as a great usage of another 80s icon. Stan \"The Man\" Lee of course had the best cameo and probably the best cameo he has ever done as it's just way too perfect. The entire foundation for most of these characters is that for all they have went through with one another, they still have a lot to go. There is great use of pathos throughout the film while not meandering on sappy overindulgence. They are far from perfect which makes me like them even more. The surreal and diverse conglomerate of characters is among the best for any action/sci-fi flick, let alone any comic book movie. The way that GOTGV.2 introduces a slew of new characters while teasing others and giving just enough time for everyone is rather impeccable and quite refreshing to see. It's a rare franchise that knows how to build a separate universe within itself and not be bogged down the slightest by everything that is going on all around them. it doesn't lose track of anything that it tries to juggle, doing everything effortlessly.\n\nI loved the story and the natural progression of characters, allowing for nice development all around. Everyone has a moment to lay their emotions on the table, even Baby Groot that fits right in with their characters. Essentially, its broken down to everyone is an asshole in some way, shape, or form to someone else to where they eventually learn of their asshole-ish ways. It's a tale as old as time, but used very well here. everyone has a reason to act like a dick even if it may be disastrous to others. it was managed very well with everyone working in pairs to reach some sort of emotional growth as a person. I probably liked the Gamora/Nebula pairing the best but the Rocket Raccoon and Yondu/Baby Groot was also very good. There was much to like seeing all these characters interact with one another that actually progressed as the movie went along and giving the story that much needed depth to anchor everything. The story is a little less involved than the first where there isn't a power structure and underlings vying for control of the galaxy.\n\nAnd since the Guardians are acting alone without interference from the Nova Corps, it frees them up to save the galaxy by themselves and not rely on a ruling authority for help or assistance. The final plan was utilized well where the entire galaxy was actually harmed by what was happening, putting the danger at a different level as well as the Guardians importance to the safety of the galaxy. There are macguffins like the first film that help drive the story forward but in no way is that a slight against it and even if they may be clich\u00e9, if used correctly can be very beneficial to the overall story without bringing it down. As you would guess as the first film centered on Star-Lord moving on from the death of his mother, the sequel focuses on the role his father had on him. While the first hit the emotional beats rather hard, the second hits them even harder with much proficiency to present an all-encompassing arch that's perhaps the best in all of the MCU.\n\nVol. 2 probably has the best moments overall in an MCU movie and maybe a comic book movie. It is chock full of memorable scenes that just flow from one to another, leaving it impossible to just pick a single one. It starts off with a bang, and much how Baby Groot stole the entire film by the ending credits of GOTG, Baby Groot once again nearly steals the entire film in the beginning credits of Vol. 2 in one of the most memorable opening credits themes ever. Backed by a classic 70s rock staple, it would move even those who are the hardest of stone and coldest of hearts. But it doesn't stop there as it presents amazing action sequence and moment after another amazing action sequence and moment. Rocket using his ingenuity and quickness was fun, Baby Groot acting like well a baby, as well as Yondu kicking some ass with his telepathic arrow were all standouts. The violent to the death rivalry between Gamora and Nebula was thrilling with some real stakes at the end. the conclusion of the film was very effective with the final battle being a battle set in space like most space epics. But it was fun and engaging while showing you can utilize factors that are used in other films of the genre and not have it be tired or overdone. It made for a perfect backdrop while opening up the franchise to new possibilities when Volume 3 comes out in 2020.\n\nThe soundtrack was yet again a classic piece of 60s and 70s pop, rock, and soul used to perfection for the most emotional, thrilling, and potent moments. I'm not sure yet if it beats the first but its damn close. I'll have to see Vol. 2 again to really let those moments and songs sink in. James Gunn truly is a master of matching up a great moment with a catchy, classic 70s hit. Given how the ending played out, I don't know where the soundtrack can go for Volume 3. But if there is anyone to challenge that and deliver, it would have to be Gunn. The GOTG films continue to be the most gorgeous and most vivid comic book and action films with special effects that continue to dazzle in the most spectacular way. I didn't see it in 3-D as I'm sure it would have been worth the price but it looked incredible without it. no other movie seems to grasp the splendiferous magnitude of space, bringing iconic imagery like the Pillars Of Creation to life like no other film can. It's just another aspect that sets it apart from essentially any other film like it. giving everyone in the theater even more of a reason to stay after the film ends; it gives the audience a whopping 5 after credit scenes ranging from just straight up funny to teasers for future films and characters to that one single question that has eluded us for millennia. It was essentially a big cherry atop the most delicious sundae ever, leaving me with just the right amount of comfort to hold me over till the sequel in three years. Or till Spiderman: Homecoming is released in several weeks.\n\nAs director and writer, James Gunn can simply do no wrong and is fully entrenched with these characters and this ever expansive world. It's a huge sigh of relief to know that he will return to direct and write Volume 3 as I cannot see anyone taking the reins from him in any way, shape, or form. He knows how to shape a character in one way only to shift it in another direction with such ease that it doesn't feel out of place. Everyone has a funny and heartfelt moment and Gunn equally disperses the action, comedy, and more emotional elements to create a great overall popcorn blockbuster. A bizarre complaint I read from a snooty, high-nosed critic said that it relied too much on juvenile humor like the size of Drax's craps. But he seemed to forget that Star-Lord made a joke about the Milano being covered in semen in the first film. If you've seen the first film, you know what you're getting into with the sequel in regards to its lowbrow humor. It's not high art meant to be compared with the likes of Coppola, Kubrick, or Hitchcock. I went to Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 for many things and one of those was to laugh at stupid humor and it delivered.\n\nI don't want to be one to sound the alarms, but I think Warner Bros. and the DCEU are in some serious trouble with GOTGV.2 performing so well. Suicide Squad desperately wanted to be like GOTG that the entire film was upended so there could be more humor added in. Not to mention the influx of classic radio hits were present throughout without any of the effort made to have the scene elevated by the usage of song choice. The rag tag bunch of losers clich\u00e9 coming together for a unified effort to stop a world ending threat is nothing new but the trick always lies in the delivery. And the GOTG just inherently knows what it is and what it wants to do. The Justice League can't try to be anything other than itself and not try to force what someone else is doing. It'll always lead to failure and as someone who is a fan of comic book movies and someone who did not like Suicide Squad or Batman V. Superman: Dawn Of Justice, that isn't what I want.\n\nIt tried so hard to compete that it fell under its own hype to be merely a semblance of what it wanted to be. It may be too late for the DCEU, but GOTG came from out of nowhere with no major characters while being set in space with a talking raccoon and a tree. There is always hope that they can rebound. The DCEU shouldn't think like their the big guys on campus and no matter whatever they'll do, their shit will not stink because everyone else will just eat it up no matter what. They have to think and act like the underdogs. Robert Downey Jr. was basically cancer to Hollywood, blacklisted by everyone but a long shot turned out to be the most profitable casting decision in the history of film and kicked off one of the most impressive franchises ever. The Batman franchise was brutally eviscerated and nearly left for dead 20 years ago only to rise up like a storming phoenix from the ashes less than a decade later. If there is one rule in Hollywood, it's that you can never count anyone out.\n\nMarvel is playing with house money now that each new weird and bizarre installment like Ant-Man, Doctor Strange, and of course Guardians Of The Galaxy have been outright successes with audiences and critics and GOTGV.2 is no different. It inherently knows how odd it is and isn't afraid to show it while reveling in its childlike antics. This is essentially part of its charm. No other comic book movie can be so goofy and dumb while showing heart and being serious all at the same time. The first installment blew away everyone's expectations to deliver an original comic book story with bizarre characters while being set in space atop a retro backdrop of music and pop culture references. The sequel had a lot to live up too, as do most with the original being so well beloved. This can harm a film drastically even before it comes out in theaters as DC can attest to that. Thankfully it delivers on all aspects to further flesh out these complex characters while introducing interesting new ones with a hefty side helping of heart, pathos, comedy, knee tapping soundtrack, dazzling special effects, and thrilling action sequences. The Guardians Of The Galaxy continue to be a shining star amid countless others of its ilk, treading its own path amid the lofty cosmos.

            "content": "May 5, 2017\n\nSupposed definition of a good Hollywood sequel: a movie that continues, rather than simply repeats, the original story and develops the characters further. If this is true, then \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,\" a sequel to the much-beloved \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" (2014), should be considered great. Not only does it continue the original's story and expand the characters' personal stories, it does so with wit, humor, and, surprisingly, emotion. And it's real, earned emotion, not sappy or artificial. Nevertheless, fans of the first film, based on a lesser known Marvel Comics property (of course), can rest assured knowing \"Vol. 2\" retains the same irreverent, flippant attitude to keep things spicy and moving. It's a sequel all right, but it's fresh and exciting and not preoccupied with merely doing the same things as before.\n\nThis is all the more unexpected given how financially successful the original \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" was, which would make one think the studio and filmmakers would try to recreate the same magic to better ensure fan turnout, and thus, profitability. But to the credit of writer-director James Gunn and his crew, the goal seems to be creating another kind of magic, and with new, interesting characters at their disposal and new depths applied to pre-existing ones, they're able to do just that. \n\nPlot-wise, things more or less pick up from when we last left our squabbling interstellar friends-Peter, a.k.a. Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), a sort of Han Solo wannabe; Gamora (Zoe Saldana), a green-skinned alien with superhuman abilities; Drax (Dave Bautista), the former human turned muscle-bound being who often breaks out into uncontrollable laughter; Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper), the competitive, foul-mouthed raccoon; and Baby Groot (voice of Vin Diesel), a talking tree with limited speech and intelligence but an undeniably adorable face (it remains a mystery to me why Vin Diesel was even cast given that his voice is so electronically manipulated, but never mind). \n\nAfter the events of the first film, this motley crew of former thieves and hunters have been charged with protecting the chaotic cosmos in various ways, shapes and forms. Their latest job finds them battling a giant, slug-like space creature in order to retrieve valuable batteries for the Sovereign race, and of course the team members are all arguing with one another about how it should be done. Peter thinks Gamora should use a sword instead of a gun; Drax thinks punching it from the inside will do the trick; Rocket thinks he has a better chance of maneuvering around the creature compared to Peter; and Baby Groot, well, he just drowns everything out while listening to E.L.O.'s \"Mr. Blue Sky.\" This diverse unit still has a love-hate relationship, but they know, just as we do, they've become not just a protective mercenary group, but an unorthodox family.\n\nIn fact, it will be their familial ties that get tested the most as the plot continues to unfold. After the Guardians defeat the monster and deliver the batteries, the Sovereign leaders hand over Nebula (Karen Gillan), Gamora's sister, who holds a deep-rooted grudge against Gamora for not protecting her from their adopted abusive father when they were kids. Nebula vows to destroy Gamora the first chance she gets, and as if she weren't enough trouble, Rocket, for no other reason than to prove he can, actually re-steals the batteries they just returned. The Sovereigns consequently send a fleet of drones after the Guardians and nearly obliterate their ship, but they're rescued by the mysterious Ego (Kurt Russell), who reveals himself as Peter's long-lost father (his romantic affair with Peter's mother opens the film). \n\nEgo invites Peter, Gamora and Drax back to his paradisiacal planet and explains he's a Celestial being, or \"god with a lowercase 'g'\", and that Peter himself is a half-deity of sorts. What Ego ultimately has in store for his son, I'll not reveal, but Ego's pet empath, Mantis (Pom Klementieff), with her bug-like eyes and antennae, has the ability to feel what others feel, and she knows a truth about Ego that she almost reveals to Drax as they develop a relationship of their own.\n\nMeanwhile, Yondu (Michael Rooker), the excommunicated, blue-skinned Ravager who kidnapped Peter as a child because \"the boy was good for thieving,\" answers the Sovereigns' call to destroy the Guardians. But circumstances and changes of heart complicate matters, and it just so happens Yondu and Rocket become unlikely allies against Yondu's once-loyal band of followers. \n\nAll of these plot threads eventually come together in a rather traditional climax, replete with all the usual battles and explosions, including an entire planet getting destroyed, but each carries its own weight, and Gunn doesn't allow any of the storylines or characters to get short-changed. He balances all the working parts exceptionally well, and as action-heavy and \"comic book-ish\" as it is, we become invested in the narrative on more than just a silly and funny sci-fi adventure level. We come to really care about what happens, even more than we did with the original, and respond emotionally to the characters' struggles and growth. The integrity with which Gunn treats the \"light and mindless material\" encourages us to not let our expectations of the genre dictate our overall impression and we appreciate \"Vol. 2\" as a thoroughly entertaining movie with lots of heart and intelligence.\n\nOf course, the production values are also top-notch, although with a $200 million budget, how could they not be? It's clearly been money well spent, as the special effects in particular are right up there with \"Dr. Strange,\" another Marvel Comics Universe entity. And for anyone who's seen \"Dr. Strange,\" which I'm guessing will be a lot of the same people who see \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,\" that's saying a lot.\n\nIf nothing else, and whether or not you're familiar with the material, the movie is just a whole lotta fun and embodies what's best about Hollywood blockbusters. Its mix of playfulness, sarcasm, emotion and romance reminded me of the first three \"Indiana Jones\" pictures, and just like those classics, Star-Lord and company, and the actors who play and voice them, have a lot of chemistry that makes them likable and down-to-earth. Plus, with music artists like E.L.O., Sam Cooke, Jay and the Americans, and Cat Stevens on the soundtrack, it's hard to walk away from \"Vol. 2\" not feeling happy. \n\nIt's funny, but at the end of my review for the first \"Guardians of the Galaxy,\" I commented on the idea of a sequel by writing, \"I would encourage the filmmakers to combine their attitude with more depth. As amusing and appealing as the characters are, I'd personally like to see them in a more original story-one with a greater purpose. It'd be great if the filmmakers could retain the movie's current wit and audacity but expand upon the substance.\" I'm almost certain the filmmakers didn't read my first review, but I am certain they've answered my call.",

The first Guardians tied loosely into the overall Marvel Universe with the Infinity Stone mostly to get everyone familiar with all the new faces we would be seeing over the next few years, but GotG2 firmly stands alone with its own conflicts and resolutions.  It has all the bright lights and flare of the first with even more colorful characters and CGI set pieces to boot.  The action is still quality and the music is still grand.  However, GotG2 lags behind its predecessor due to multiple plot threads involving nearly every character and then some. \n\nChris Pratt as Peter Quill once again takes center stage as the main hero.  We got bits and pieces of his alien heritage back in the first film, but James Gunn seems to have firmly rooted the second in finding out who his father really is.  For story purposes, it is an enlightening dynamic and great added background for the character.  It ended up being the climax of the story, but I felt the movie lingered a tad too long on this thread without enough of a punch.  Kurt Russell, Ego the living planet and Quill's father (no spoilers there), gave a stoic performance as the celestial, but as is tradition in most Marvel movies, the villain lacked any real punch.  How many times have we seen a god-like being try to take over the universe with only a few added scenes thrown in for good measure to make it look like what is happening right in front of us on screen with our heroes is affecting the rest of the galaxy?  \n\nIn fact, the added side conflict with The Sovereigns, who were hilarious in their own right, and the sister-sister conflict of Gamorra and Nebula AND Rocket's internal emotional struggle AND Yondu's conflict with his own crew made the entire GotG2 feel more like a comic book with so many things going on at once rather than a traditional movie with a focused plot.   Credit is due though for at least wrapping up most of these (save one for the third film) so we aren't left waiting another two or three years for certain story lines to get resolved.\n\nThe plot convolution was really my only big gripe for this film, but enough to knock it down to 3 1/2 stars, especially when compared to other Marvel movies we've seen in the past few years.  Let's face it...all Marvel movies (except Iron Man 2 and maybe one other I can't think of) have been duds.  They continuously knock it out of the park thanks to a blossoming cast of some of the best stars (too many to name).  However, a true show stealer, Baby Groot was always going to be the one character who really suckered us into seeing this film.\n\nGotG2 expands on its universe by including a plethora of new characters for us to get invested in and new worlds and easter eggs to recognize and look for.  Performances are beefed up but not ham-fisted.  There is a delicate balance of emotion with action and the visuals still invite you to take second and third glances.  it's just so packed with story lines, keeping track of everything in just over 2 hours makes you wish for a longer run-time.",

James Gunn took time to develop each character by expressing their back story, what their fears are, or even how they became to be.\n\nOne problem this movie also has is the main villain which turns out to be lack luster and is truly confusing whenever you find out who it is; which takes an exceptional amount of time.\n\nTherefore, Guardians of the Galaxy is a decent movie that is better than the first one. With the character development, visuals ,and high paced action this movie truly takes the cake in being a decent movie.\n\nSee this if you want the see the sequel, if you're a marvel fan, or if you want to see a decent movie.",

The first 2/3's of Guardians 2 is probably some of the worst content that marvel has created in a long time. It's unfocused, poorly edited, just all over the place, and NONE of the jokes land I've never been in a comedy, with a more dead silent audience. Basically every joke is just drawing out some quirky character trait of one of the leads, and/or a really intense moment, followed by a melancholy reaction from another character, and you can see where each joke is going, a mile away. All of that could be forgiven, because humor is subjective, but I refuse to forgive the fact that the movie is so intent on distracting from the actual drama of the story, which is SO GOOD. I'll let a bad joke slide, but not when it's in the way of something that's 10000 times better. That is the first 2 acts in a nutshell.\n\nThe final third act is full of a tight, focused, emotional story, that made it VERY difficult not to tear up in the theater, and it's one of the very few movies that works with over-the-top, on-the-nose dialogue about the morals of the story, and not only does it work, i can't imagine the same movie without it. Sure, it gets kinda cheesy after the 5th time a character recites the theme to me, but I can give it a pass because of the rest of the story's effectiveness. \n\nIn summary, if I walked in to the movie about two hours in, I'd be over the moon, raving about how brilliant this movie is, but as a 2hr 18m movie goes, there are two glaring issues, that keep me from loving this movie- Inconsistency, and most importantly, FAKE DRAMA. The drama that presents itself is SPECTACULAR, but the whole reason the drama even exists is because of an egregious moment, where the character mantis telling Drax about the true intentions of the movie's antagonist, is interrupted by something as simple as Gamora interrupting their conversation! She was GOING TO TELL DRAX, and they could've handled this LONG before all of the stakes were in place. Something so blatantly simple, stands in the way of an otherwise fantastic story! I'm so torn on how I feel about this movie, because every part of me knows that it's bad, but I can't help but feel an extreme sense of overwhelming emotions in those last 30 minutes. If I were asked, \"do you recommend this movie?\", then I'd have to say yes to the average person, but only a maybe to a more analytical, critical person, if given, I could tell them, \"just wait.\"",

But when the third act exploded onto the screen and was followed by a wonderful ending, I started to love it all over again. What I'm trying to say is that \"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2\" has some typical and uninteresting moments within, but the insanely high highs made me forgive those parts.\n\nTo explain what those bland parts were, I'll just say that there was a couple chunks of the film in the middle that felt like things I'd seen before in every other post-Ironman superhero film. I didn't find them interesting, and I felt that there were too many hit retro songs thrown in just because people liked the soundtrack of the original. It wasn't like it became a bad movie, it just stopped being a new and creative one.\n\nBut, when I said there were insanely high highs I really meant it. For every unnecessary pop song there was a B-side gem that's lyrics and melody paired beautifully with what was happening on screen. And for every boring, Marvel-mandated plot shart, there was an eye-popping visual effect or an unexpectedly person character moment.\n\nI don't often rewatch the superhero films that have been released in the last five years, because they're generally too formulaic for me to find anything new in a second watch through. But \"Volume 2\" felt different. I think it would've been better if Marvel didn't require all their films to be connected, but it still managed to stand out. And it obviously gets extra points for the Hasselhoff-related scenes.",

Guardians 2 lost its momentum without a clear direction and dangerous villain. I felt little peril for the heroes and this only diminished with each successive, impossible, gravity defying escape with nary a scratch on any of them. I couldn't suspend my disbelief and be drawn into the fun like with the original. Style took a backseat to substance. The third Act picked up a bit, but it was too late for me. If you're 12, you'll probably like the film. Much older than that, I don't recommend it.",

Now that they're really known as the Guardians of the Galaxy, they have been doing redeeming the good around the galaxy. Until they come across a particular individual. One who is relations with Peter Quill a.k.a. Star-Lord.\n\nLet's talk about a little bit about the soundtrack. Which is important, an essential part of the story. With how they were so good in the first movie, there is no doubt the tracks we'll hear will coincide with whatever is gonna happen in volume 2. This second movie is another roller coaster ride but in another turn. In a different path but still attaining the feel that was already established from the first movie. The intro quite shows it. My favorite of them all is the moment with Rocket Raccoon. I truly enjoyed that scene with one of the soundtracks.\n\nBaby Groot has a special moment in the movie and I hate to admit that it's quite cute of him trying to do his best, it's also one of the best moments Groot has done so far. We'll hope to see more of him in Avengers: Infinity War. Especially interacting with Hulk.\n\nThere are scenes that seem kinda forced. To develop a little more on the characteristic side. While it's totally fine that this is done and all of things have to conclude somehow, I feel like it was just to cater specific people who watch this amazing yet fan demanding-ish movie. Hopefully, we get a lot more peering towards the story and that we can have this characters move on further than they were before.\n\nOverall, the movie was really enjoyable. Drax enjoys the usual ensue of glorious battles, Gamora trying to keep everyone in line while Peter and Rocket seem to bicker more than the usual. Yondu gets a very special spotlight and you'll know what I mean if you ever bother to watch the movie. You should though because one can not simply pass up a Marvel movie.",

            "content": "Proper Perspective:  It is impossible to not qualify a movies quality based on the original or its predecessors, but for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, try to do that. The first one was lightning in a bottle and the follow-up was a ton of fun as its own movie, building on the lore and characters we were all introduced to in Vol. 1. After seeing it twice, let's talk about Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2...\n\nOfficial Synopsis: Set to the backdrop of Awesome Mixtape #2, 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' continues the team's adventures as they unravel the mystery of Peter Quill's true parentage.\n\nPlot: Once it is revealed who Peter Quill's father is, the Guardians are split up and have to work together, through new and testing challenges that will try their will as a \"family.\"\n\nTake: Vol. 2 may not have the same overall sound and nostalgic pull as Vol. 1, but it is equally terrific for some of the same reasons and a few of its own new reasons. There is a lot to unpack in this movie, so how about a quick paragraph overview? Ya, okay good:\n\nThe Guardians are good guys for hire and go to protect some batteries for the Sovereign People... Then they meet Star-Lord's (Chris Pratt) father, Ego the Living Planet (Kurt Russell) and Mantis (Pom Klementieff) while unraveling the story of Star-Lord's past... The Ravagers are not happy with Yondu (Michael Rooker) so he, Rocket (Bradley Cooper), and Baby Groot (Vin Diesel) have to deal with that fun... Gamora (Zoe Saldona) and Nebula (Karen Gillan) continue their sister-ly relationship... Oh, and a dude named Taserface (Chris Sullivan) factors into all of this.\n\nGot it?\n\nWhile there are a lot of stories unfolding at once answering questions from the last movie, setting up future movies, and closing loops in this story the pacing and story unfolded great. \n\nJames Gunn has a signature style of writing with humor, character, and depth that allows you to connect with all of the characters no matter their overall screen time. For example, in Vol. 2 Sean Gunn is in a handful of scenes, but you are invested in his arc as a Ravager that is frustrated with Yondu, but not in support of Taserface. He just wants to do the right thing.\n\nThis movie nails character. Even Taserface.\n\nThe jokes really landed in this movie as much as in Vol. 1, where the movies differ is that while the first act doubles down on the jokes, the second act is focused on building story, and there is a level of drama and heaviness that will stay with you. As much as these movies are alike they are very different. \n\nGreat direction, awesome pacing, fantastic writing, fun characters and performances, and overall a fun time in the theaters.\n\nRecommendation: Sure, this may not be as memorable as the first movie, but it has merit to stand on that it is an equally fun and entertaining movie. I've seen it twice, once with adults and beverages and once with my kids and both audiences loved the movie from beginning to end...\n\nIs Rocket a Trash Panda? A Raboon? A Racoon? A Triangle-Faced Monkey? WHAT IS HE???",

So instead, director James Gunn decided to focus on making people happy instead of pushing a plot. Opinions will differ on whether it was the smart move or lazy move, as well as whether it worked, but personally I think it was brilliant. If you go in wanting to learn more about MCU and how everything will set up for Infinity Wars, you will come out very disappointed. But if you just want to be entertained for 2 hours, this is the movie to watch.

I would have much rather dealt with building the bridgework to eventually toppling Thanos.  I will be much more cautious about spending my hard earned money to watch Vol. 3, I will probably wait for it to get to the dollar theater.  I hate to say that because I love the characters so much, and I was glad to see them again, but I thought there was too much anxiety, interpersonal turmoil and also Drax was too goofy and chummy.  I gave it 3.5 out of 5 starts, which is probably being a little nice.",

This is a fleeting moment, but it registers with me because while Vol. 2 of this nice departure of films from Marvel, advocates for the idea of family, these characters often bicker at each other almost relentlessly in these films, that when they suddenly realize they love each other, it feels half-heartedly dropped into the film. Don't get me wrong, Vol. 2 is often fun and even quite moving near its end, however, the consistent snarkiness from the cast of characters that is supposed to elicit laughs, starts feeling rather cynical after a while. The most pleasing dynamic represented in this sequel might have to be the relationship between Gamora and her fiery sister Nebula. Their relationship is fleshed out so much in this film, I wouldn't mind seeing an origin story with the two. Kurt Russell plays the father of Chris Pratt's Star Lord, and things aren't necessarily how they appear. The plot takes us to some unlikely places with their past and while Pratt sometimes struggles with the dramatic acting moments, the film finally allows for some catharsis near the end. While never as hilarious or as thrilling as the original, Vol. 2 successfully capitalizes on the success of the first. It's pretty to look at enjoyable to watch, but is occasionally diminished by the sheer harshness of the characters to each other (I'm looking at Rocket on this one). Drax nearly steals the show.

Sure, it's bigger spectacled and deeper themed, but its real strength lies in its smaller moments of character and humor. In fact, when the words being spoken aren't jokes, corny exposition and telegraphed subtext sneak to the surface (\"Sometimes we don't realize what we need is right there all along.\"). Thankfully, director Gunn deftly redeems each less-than-stellar story moment with cheeky jokes and surprising humanity.\nIf the first was New Hope, then Vol. 2 is Empire, as we find Starlord (Pratt) dealing with his own daddy issues (Russell), as the universe at large is fighting a bigger (though possibly related) battle. The action scenes have cinematic flair and dramatic heft, but the charm is still 100% dependent upon its tongue being so firmly placed in its cheek in subversive and unexpected ways. The music is a smile-inducing mix of 70s and 80s power pop, Rocket is still drolly hot-headed, Drax is still hilariously literal, Baby Groot is adorably violent, and new addition Mantis fits in snugly.\nSo why isn't this consider among Marvel's best for me? Well, as a longtime Marvel Studios zombie, I hate to admit it, but these MCU outings are finally starting to feel a bit same-y. Lots of parental problems, brightly colored CGI, a standard build in impressive action scenes to a final with the Big Boss, all punctured with good-natured humor. Luckily, the formula is a good one, and with Guardians, what it lacks in dramatic intrigue, it makes up for with irreverence for its own seriousness, helping it stand out from the larger superhero pack.",

There is quite a melancholy undertone beneath the bubbly surface, which is welcome enough since it creates a wider spectrum of emotions for the audience to enjoy. Whether the jokes sink in is up to the viewer's tastes but there is not too much to complain about in the comedy department. The movie overall is a very safe bet to go and see if you want a spike of energy in your week.",

            "content": "Back in 2014, not many people knew about the Guardians of the Galaxy. Many felt that it was Marvel digging at the bottom of the barrel for profit. When the film came out, people were hooked. It was a hilariously fresh take on a rag tag group of Superheroes. After the great first entry, I was hoping that the second installment would be a hit. Well personally, I feel that Vol.2 is better than the first.\nThis story shares a lot of similarities with Empire Strikes Back. However it does it in a way where it's not trying to copy the formula it just seems that it flowed perfectly with this universe. Much like Empire, the main characters are split up and the characters have to deal with a huge dramatic conflict. Star lord has to deal with his father, Gamora has to deal with the sibling rivalry of Nebula and Rocket is dealing with a crisis of conscience. Drax doesn't have that much of a story, however he makes up for it with the humor. A majority of the laughs comes from Drax. Baby Groot is just cute. The film does the opposite of what we expect a sequel to be which is bigger. There's not a lot of action sequences compared to the first film. It works however because of the characters, this film is more focused on building the characters backstory. The first film is really good at tugging at your heart strings. This one had me holding back my eyes from watering up. Why....because when you realize the relationship of Starlord and Yondu. You realize the expert writing of the story. In the first film, Yondu seemed like a villain, however in this film you understand the actions of that character. Growing up watching films, Michael Rooker has always been that actor that is so good that he makes himself unlikeable. My parents would always watch those back in the day Civil Rights movies and Rooker was always the go to guy for racist asshole. Rooker was just that good to play as a racist with the accent. Then I saw Henry: Portrait of a serial killer and didn't like him even more. Well finally he has redeemed himself with his portrayal of Yondu, his character is more heartfelt in this film. \nCharacterization like this is the reason why not only James Gunn is the perfect director/writer for this film but it also shows how important it is to have fewer writers. So many blockbusters have more than 2 writers which causes a lot of inconsistencies.\nThe music as always is great. Ever since the first film, DC and other films have tried to utilize the same soundtrack formula. Taking older songs to promote their films. The reason most films and when I mean most I mean Suicide squad failed. Is due to the fact that they didn't understand the purpose behind Guardians use of the music. The mixtape songs were given to Peter by his mother. In a film that takes place across the galaxy it is great to hear familiar songs to keep us grounded. The songs were carefully picked as to what a women would listen to in the 70's and 80's. Which explains why the set list has a wide array of pop songs. Another key thing to the contemporary music is using songs that we are familiar with but haven't heard in a while. The songs are more of a B-Side that hasn't been heavily exploited in other movies or commercials. Which is why the first few minutes of Suicide Squad feels more like a top 100 commercial.\nMany probably had a lot of doubt as to if this film can live up to the hype of the first film and it does...it exceeds it.",

The eye-catching visuals and infectiously entertaining set pieces will undoubtedly entertain, but as things unfurl on the narrative front, the more you may or may not start to realize just how flimsy and directionless things are this time around. Still though, there's enough charm and character in this particular piece to power through some of the slower, more aimless portions of the story at hand. Indeed, it definitely does not feature as clean and clear of a narrative as its predecessor, but this \"Guardians Of The Galaxy\" sequel ultimately *just* lives up to the standards set by the Marvel brand.",

I felt that Marvel is pandering to a crowd that now expects these movies to be funny rather than worth a story.  It's sadly why nobody takes these movies seriously anymore. And I fear we will never get to go back to the beloved time of super hero movies that aren't cookie cutter to the same old tune.   This movie has some amazing qualities, but sadly has fallen victim to the Marvel machine, that has manufactured yet another bland, story-less, crowd pleasing carrot to feed to the starving masses they have created.",

Not because the plot is lame or confusing but it is abit jumbled, choppy & disjointed at times; lacking the focus, balance & urgancy of Vol.1.

Not only did baby Groot get cuter, but the Guardians of the Galaxy kept their cool, their style, and that uniqueness that sets them apart from the rest of all Marvel superheroes. The Guardians of the Galaxy make a comeback with a sequel that strives to be better than it predecessor, and it succeeds, taking that working formula from the first movie, and adding a bit more whimsy and excitement on top of it.\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 starts out with the Guardians on the job, as they are hired to defend valuable batteries, owned by the Sovereign Race, from being stolen. This sets the opening for the real plot, which follows Star Lord's relationship with his father, after they meet for the first time. The story develops into an interesting plot twist, when Quill needs to decide between following the family he was born in or the family he has chosen.\n\nThe story is packed with new characters and side stories. There is a lot going on for those of us foreign to the comics. However, as much as everyone would love to learn more about the background of the new characters or even the Guardians of the Galaxy, I have learned to accept this is not going to happen. There is too much information in Marvel movies already, and this would only extend the run time... by a lot. Rather, I prefer to look at what they can do with the information they give you, how good can the alternative plot lines fit into the main story, and how everything makes sense.\n\nLooking at it in this manner, gives you a greater appreciation of the plot. Director James Gunn does an amazing job at developing the story, skipping over any serious or dull moments and challenging its audience on how much humor they can take. The film manages to be full of heart while making it clear that sentimentalism is not allowed. A film designed for everyone to have a good time.\n\nVolume 2 follows the same recipe as the first movie: Witty and sarcastic humor, amazing visuals, and an entertaining story. It manages to go farther than the first movie in every aspect, and it is hard not to love the characterization. I don't know about you, but I cannot wait to see Groot next to Hulk or Rocket next to Iron Man. There is no doubt that Guardians of the Galaxy is a beautiful addition to the Marvel universe, and Volume 2 just made it even better.",

            "content": "With the first Guardians of the Galaxy I went (or at least wanted to go) into the film with little to no expectations. Of course, with Vol. 2 it would be next to impossible to do the same unless one had skipped the first which, of course, would then only mean it would be next to impossible to fully understand or better yet, appreciate, what this second film has to offer. And so, despite having some expectation for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 there wasn't much beyond suspecting that writer/director James Gunn might hand pick a new list of late seventies/early eighties hits to set something of a remixed version of the original's events to while pushing whatever story points the Marvel overlords needed pushed forward. If this sequel teaches us anything though (and it does try to teach if not at least say something significant) it's that sometimes expectations aren't detrimental to the overall effect a piece of art can have. That's right-I'm calling a Marvel movie, and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 specifically, a piece of art as well as stating that it surpasses all expectations. I'm saying this loud and clear because I feel like it would be easy to think otherwise about the rather unconventional super hero movie that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 actually is. It seems it might be easy to be disappointed in the sequel because it doesn't exactly fit into the conventions we've become conditioned to expect. How does Guardians numero dos buck this trend that Marvel has so perfectly perfected as of late? Well, the first thing it changes is that of setting up a convenient villain in the form of another Thanos crony looking for world domination (Gunn literally thought bigger this time, going for galactic domination) while also giving our heroes a real and emotional investment in the plight of the antagonist. Sure, the film opens with the guardians on a for hire mission that sees them doing battle with a large CGI monster for the purposes of getting paid handsomely by a race of snobby and rather pretentious Goldfinger/Goldmember lookalikes, but this is essentially only a framing device and reason to usher Michael Rooker's Yondu back into the fray. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is instead mostly about the relationships between the members of the titular team and developing those dynamics in exchange for progressing the overall Marvel arc. Where Vol. 2 really exceeds though, is in balancing the exploration of these relationships with that of still telling an effective story, the guardians story, and there's just something special about a ginormous, big-budget, special-effects extravaganza that feels this personal.\n\nread the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com",

I see a lot of critics trying to pan this; claiming that the banter between the core group is lacking, but they're wrong.  The core group is a family now so the bickering and the back-and-forth is not only expected but kind of priceless.  Tons of effort has gone into the visuals for this film, so much so that I defy you to watch this and find any scene that's not interesting to look at...James Gunn has knocked it out of the park with this and this move deserves a stack of awards!

The soundtrack was mainly songs from the '60s '70s & early '80s, pretty much the only music I grew up with, plus a couple newer songs which fit in pretty well with the rest!\n\nThe plot is perfect, nothing felt out of place! Everything that's set up early in the film has a purpose (purpose being the overall theme of the story). The happy moments, the sad moments, the comedy, drama, action, & truly human moments, even what some might consider forced exposition (which it wasn't); it all flowed into the narrative, like a river.\n\nThe actors & their characterization were great! Everyone played their part spot on, while providing new insight into them, as much as I cared for these characters, they got me to care for them even more!\n\nThe action was great! Space battles, shoot'em up style fights, hand to hand combat, & stuff I can't get into without spoiling things. Everything is paced well, so folks can have a break between action sequences, so it feels less...relentless.\n\nThe effects were a perfect blend of crystalline CGI, & practical makeup & sets that, combined with the acting, made everything feel so real, I half expected to see starships flying overhead instead of planes as I walked out've the theater.\n\n5 stars out of 5, I felt so many different emotions throughout the course of this film, & I was never bored. It held my attention during even the quiet moments. And it made the original GotG film look like Fant4stic. I am not recommending this film to anyone, I am telling everyone, you NEED to see this film, what ever your taste is, it has something for all of you; it's better than Avengers!!!!",

First of all, when the Guardians are running from the gold people (not sure their species so im calling them that), they chase them through an asteroid field. In the field, the Guardians and the Gold People are about the same speed. However, when they get out, some of them went around the field. Not only did they catch up, but they also passed them. If they are faster then the Guardians, how did the ones in the field not catch them? When Ego destroyed all of the ships, that raises another question. How did he find them in that exact position? Space is MASSIVE, the chances of running into them is next to 0. Sure, hes a God, but the only powers he exhibited is the ability to manipulate reality, and know what happens on his own planet. How would he know where to find them? The fact they defeat Ego with a bomb made in 2 minutes, Ego telling Peter that HE gave her Cancer, the old trope where the villian has to kill them AS SLOWLY AS HE POSSIBLY CAN, WHICH ENDED UP LEADING TO HIS DEATH. The introduction of Peter's powers then just getting rid of them at the end, underplaying everyone but Peter, the fact that Peter is not only half of his fathers species, which should logically mean Peter's powers would be weaker, but the fact that Ego has had MILLIONS of years to master his powers yet gets beaten by someone who should only have half of his powers, but also JUST learned how to use them properly, all make me dislike this movie.

And it was glorious.\n\nVol 2 is this again but now they know that the formula works somehow it lacks something... they add in a legendary actor to play the bad guy and give one time villain Nebula a bit of character development. these improvements plus everything else that you loved about Vol 1... yet something feels off. its too much of a good thing. It's a giant brightly coloured sugary cookie of a movie. great at first but you might feel a bit sick afterwards.",

Set to the backdrop of Awesome Mixtape #2, Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 2 finds Peter Quill/Star Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), & Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) hired by the Sovereign race to battle an inter-dimensional monster in defense of precious batteries. When Rocket pockets a few of the batteries, the Sovereigns, on command of their leader, Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki,) take relentless pursuit. When the team crash-lands on a nearby planet, they are rescued by Ego (Kurt Russell), a god-like Celestial & his pet empath, Mantis (Pom Klementieff). Ego reveals himself to be Peter's long-lost father & escorts Peter, Gamora, & Drax to his distant planet, while Rocket & Groot remain behind to fix the ship & keep watch on Gamora's jealous sister Nebula (Karen Gillan.) Unexpectedly they are captured by former greater Ravager community member Yondu Udonta (Michael Rooker) & his crew. Back on Ego's planet, Gamora begins to suspect something isn't quite right with Ego. When they learn the truth, the Guardians must once again save the galaxy from destruction. James Gunn returns as writer & director, & although the original Guardians was a much better film, has still made a ridiculously exciting & wildly funny summer film. The performances from the cast were solid while the cameos by well-known stars left me wondering what the point of their being the film. SEE THIS FILM in 2D, 3D, & IMAX 3D & stay for five post credit scenes.",

What made the first one so good though was it had all the good and did it with true emotion as well.  Volume 2 has the jokes, the action and yes some good emotion, but this time the emotion feels a little forced, or maybe not as genuine.  The first act of the film is top notch, second act drags some, and the third act falls in between.  I enjoyed the fact that Marvel still made this a stand alone film, and didn't feel like it was necessary to do some huge Avengers tie in with it.

Where movies like Star Trek Beyond made you feel like they were putting in one-liners just for the sake of it, 95% of the one-liners in GOTGV2 were spot-on, from all characters.  \nThe biggest weakness of the film was the story line.  I wish Rocket had stolen something of a bit more consequence to make Ayesha attack with such vengeance.  And the Egos storyline was just cliche.  The scenes in his homeplanet showing the \"scenes\" of how he met Peter's mother were lifted straight out of Man of Steel.

The pacing, the story line, over acting in some places, the execution was just not on point and the movie did not flow the same as the original. As someone who fully engrosses themselves in movies as much as I can, I found myself being thrust out of my immersion due to choppy execution or long sections with little purpose.

The colors are vibrant which does wonders for the eyes.  Possibly seeming over reliant on the CG, Guardians of the Galaxy manages to hold everything together without getting caught up in the visual spectacle.\n\nChris Pratt is the life of the film.  Zoe Saldana continues to fill the shoes of Gamora.

James Gunn has done it again by making another gem for the Guardians Franchise.\n\nThis movie has every genre rolled up into one (Action, Comedy, Drama, Romance, everything). I simply don't understand how a person could watch this movie and not be entertained. You must have either the worst humor known to mankind, or the emotional height of a hermit crab to not like this movie.\n\nI can't find one thing with that movie that I didn't like or one point that was \"slow\", or where it had \"long boring stretches\" as some of the so called \"Critics\" claim. I would like to watch this movie with one of those critics who claim that, and have them pause it at the part they think is slow or a long boring stretch and explain that to me. \n\nI thought it had fantastic pace, and at no point was I bored or finding myself thinking when is this going to be over. Every detail was thought out and executed perfectly. Everything done in this movie was done intentionally, and purposefully.\n\nIf you try to compare it to the First Guardians then that may be part of the problem. I feel most the critics and people who don't enjoy this movie as much wanted this to be an exact clone of the first. The first was no doubt a classic, but this is a sequel not a clone. In a sequel, there is supposed to be some character arc and character development, group dynamic development, it is supposed to build upon what made the first one great. In my mind it passed every test and checked every category with flying colors.\n\nAnother masterpiece, and a very fun ride. 10/10\n\nPS - Spend the extra money and see it in IMAX 3D if you have the chance. It will blow you away, and it is worth every penny you pay. EVERYTHING is 3-D at all times, and the IMAX sound reverberates through your body making you feel like you are in the movie.",

            "content": "For those who are waiting for Marvel Studios to drop the ball and make a completely terrible movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, get ready to keep waiting.  Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 picks up right where the first film left off.  It has a very similar feel, as it blends fun action and adventure with a fair amount of comedy and some classic songs.  You can tell that the same writer/director took the helm because James Gunn made it all cohesive with the stories and characters that were established in the first movie.  While I don\u0092t think I liked this movie quite as much as the first, it was pretty close, and my opinion might improve when I see it again.\n\nAside from the pure and simple fun brought from the action and comedy, what impressed me so much about Guardians 2 is all the character development they pulled off.  There are 9 different characters who all show some growth as the movie progresses, and yet it never felt cluttered or bloated.  The mistake of including too many characters has been an infamous pitfall for so many comic book movies in the past, but this film just proves it can be done with a good script and solid actors.  I have no complaints about any of the cast, they all deliver even when some of them are forced to play against type for select scenes.\n\nI\u0092ll willingly admit that there were two flaws I saw in Guardians 2.  First was an odd feeling that James Gunn didn\u0092t trust his audience enough.  Character motivations were spelled out for the audience, plans were all articulated verbally, even some relationships are vocalized instead of experienced.  More subtlety was called for because we could have figured things out for ourselves. The other flaw is the relative predictability of the plot. Once things get in motion you can see where they are going. There were a few events that surprised me, particularly one at the very end, but there isn't much I'd call unexpected. The movie follows a familiar formula. \n\nThose things didn't bother me all that much, though. Perhaps I'm just an easy mark, but I forgave any minor transgressions in Guardians because I was smiling and laughing through so much of it (and even crying once.) The effects were second-to-none to the point where I never even thought about the fact that Groot and Rocket weren't really there. The IMAX looked great, and this movie might have had the best 3-D I've ever seen in a movie that was converted (not filmed) in 3-D. The Guardians of the Galaxy might be the oddest group of characters that Marvel has brought to film, but they also seem to be some of the best. I wanted to watch it again almost immediately after leaving the theater.",

Timing was on point.\nCon: The drama was a little contrived and didn't seem natural.\nPro:The team gelled well together and we're likable as always\nCon: Gamora is still worst part of film. Badly cast, written and acted\nCon: The villain is bland. Though this may also be true for GotG 1, this time it hurts the story because there is a relationship between the heroes and the villain when in vol 1 there wasn't \nPro: Yondu and the Sovereign are really great.\nPro: Soundtrack is excellent again\nCon: Including the soundtrack was more forced this time while in vol 1 it was an integral part of the story \n\nOverall: Super fun movie that looks great, well worth the price of entry.",

I was pleasantly surprised at the hilarity of Drax; unburdened from his blind quest for vengeance that ended in the first Guardians, Drax exposes a gleeful side that makes his rage in the first Guardians all the more tragic. \n\nBut at the end, it's about Peter Quill meeting his father, and about what it means to be a dad.

It's not as iconic as the first film since by now we recognize the banter and raw characters that are trademark of a James Gunn film, it still proves to be entertaining if you don't hate predictable formulas. This movie provided the development for plenty of major and minor characters and still felt crammed into a two hour movie. Backstory was thrown in and dialogue mentioned cool stories we never got to see. There was plenty of time made for unnecessary moments that didn't push forward the plot, but these scenes add personality to a Gunn film rather than the standard marvel plot line which is what makes GOTG movies their own standard. There was still plenty of suspense to make up for the lack of action sequences and exciting set up for the next movie. Though it was disheartening for the (spoiler) new guardian Yandu to self-sacrifice, and for Peter to quickly lose his unseen before god-like powers, there is enough that happened in this movie to affect the next one, making this one a must see for fans of the guardians",

This one picks up right where the first volume left off, with the gang collecting bounties from odd alien races, taking missteps (and making enemies) despite themselves. I loved the first one, consider it one of the best the MCU has to offer, and this sequel is right on the same level. Unabashedly chaotic, recklessly entertaining, cheeky and silly, emotive and sweet, it touches many of the same nerves that made the original so well-liked and even goes a step or two further. Given such a quirky, offbeat opening take, there's always the risk that sequels will come off as forced or derivative, but that isn't the case here. The humor still feels sharp and appropriate, the core cast shares the camaraderie (and constant personality clashes) of a real family, the greater universe remains intensely deep and well-populated. And there's still plenty of time to develop ancillary characters, be they new foils or uneasy old allies. In fact, one such dose of potent character development efficiently shifts a minor player from the first act into a significant part of the story this time around. Quick with wit and with the cannons, never afraid to let its inner weirdness shine like a beacon, brimming with vibrant life in every scene, it's vast and rich and sprawling and completely enjoyable. Guardians Volume 2 made me thoroughly happy. How long until the next one?\n\nUpdated thoughts after a recent re-watch (2018):\nJust as loose and entertaining as the original, though less tentative, no longer compelled to prove itself as a viable, if offbeat, property. In other words, Volume 2 is free to let its freak flag fly, to fully embrace its inner weirdness. And wow, what vibrant, colorful, unimaginably rich spoils it reaps. Each setting feels unique and cultured, from sleazy ice brothels to the ornate, richly detailed architecture and stunning, unexpectedly lively landscapes found upon Ego, the living planet. It's a visual feast, backed by another groovy, excellent soundtrack, finely-tuned comedic timing and a sweet, resonant set of character studies. Tons of fun to watch, impossible to hear without shaking a hip, meaningful and memorable from a long-term storytelling perspective. An impressive step up from what was already one of my favorite films in the MCU.",

The story gets tangled up in a lot of family drama this time around, but writer/director James Gunn fills those moments with some crazy space action. The subplot with the gold people was unnecessary and only served to add more action the climax. The soundtrack is once again an awesome mix, the opening credits is a crowd pleaser and Baby Groot is going to sell a lot of toys.  Chris Pratt seemed more subdued this time around. Dave Bautista and Bradley Cooper get most of the funny lines, but it is Kurt Russell and Michael Rooker who steal the show. Yondu's story arc and the final 15 minutes is what elevates this movie and gives it weight. James Gunn knew we were all going to stay during the end credits, so he gave us a lively end credit sequence. Finally, end credits worth sitting around for. VOL. 2 is a fun sequel that expands on its characters, gives the best Stan Lee cameo ever, and maintains most of that off-beat quirkiness we fell in love with the first time around. \n\nGrade: B+",

How many times can you enjoy watching two guys hurl through air, repeatedly punching each other, for example?\nThere are some exceptions to this of course (Logan\") but superheroes nowadays are better off in TV or streaming series such as Luke Cage\" where the makers get the chance to put freshness and depth on the table.\nThe first Guardians of the Galaxy\" collected over 770 million dollars from the cinemas in 2014, so the sequel is, of course, very similar. A true-blood superhero movie, just like the grandmother used to make.\nIt's loud, brash, full of colors and explosions and always ready to gently tease about superhero and sci-fi movies' tired cliches, without bringing anything to replace them.\nYes, the result is full of energy\" and much fun\", but if you don't particularly care about the paper-thin characters or picturebook world they inhabit, it's difficult to hold interest after 30 minutes or so.\nAnd how can one care if there's never even a slight feeling that any big character is really in danger, no matter how large the explosions and enemy guns! It's all sound and fury, signifying nothing, as the late great Shakespeare would say.\nThe story is trivial as expected and thus would work better in small doses... but the movie format is much more profitable, so we get about 140 minutes in a row.\nNevermind that there's maybe 90 minutes worth of story here, every self-respecting Hollywood epic must last over two hours.

Gunn has fleshed out all his characters further and kind of gets to push the restart button with Groot with nods to the first film specifically Groot and Drax's relationship. Some aspects and songs are better in the from the original film, but in other respects this film manages to reach in better levels of emotional pull. There's a more emotional villain, deeper relationships to delve into, and plenty of beautiful space battles to enjoy. I'm not sure yet where I would rank this in the Marvel Cinematic universe yet, but it delivers so much fun, action, and packs an emotional pack that it is among the best for sure. All the original cast is marvelous and it is great fun to see Kurt Russell make his presence felt, but for me the driving force of the film is Michael Rooker's Yondu.\n\n****/****\n\nMy wife and I watched this in true IMAX 3D. The IMAX was great the biggest screen possible to see the glorious action and effects, but the 3D was not all that spectacular for me.

The characters are what make these movies and they were once again terrific in the sequel.  They all had their amusing moments and Gamora was given more to do which made her an improvement over the first Guardians and Yondu was surprisingly good as well.  The story was was simple and easy to see where it was heading but the way there was entertaining.  Special effects?  The best of course.  Humor?  Part of the reason the first film was among my favorite Marvel films was the jokes and banter between the Guardians and this sequel increased that... which in this case was a mixed bag.  While plenty of the jokes hit the issue for me was that there were so many of them.  Rapid fire they often came, joke, joke, joke.  Sometimes got in the way of everything else, wanted to see characters breathe or more world building and constant joke cracking got in the way of that.  Emotional moments also were dead weight for me for the most part like the attempt to tug on the heartstrings with the relationship of Starlord with Ego and Yondu.  Really didn't work for me.\n\nStill, the positives certainly outweighed my issues with Vol 2, while this won't be on my Top Ten list this year unlike the original back in 2014, it will get an 7/10* and is a solid sequel.\n\n*Saw Guardians 2 again and after the rewatch I have to downgrade it slightly.  The jokes that didn't land for me the first time around were evn more painfully unfunny and a few of the sillier bits were just... not enjoyable to watch.  Will settle with about a 7.5 as overall still a fun film... just with parts of cringe that ruin the flow.",

            "content": "The short of it is, if you enjoyed Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol 1, you're very likely going to enjoy Vol 2.\nMost know why Vol 1 faired so well, because like Ant Man, the MCU has been able to take obscure characters and stories, and breath colorful and engaging life into them. Some recent comic-based movies have taken too many liberties with their IP (or overthought them), while Marvel Studio has found a seemingly perfect balance of respecting IP and carefully crafting their own narratives; and this is very true for GotG Vol 2. While I'm not a huge comic book reader anymore, I do enjoy reading about character background while waiting for a comic movie's release. I've found that most of the changes, or added story that Marvel, or in this case James Gunn, have made are both equally respectful and creatively cautious with their IP.\nVol 2 has everything you'd expect from a GotG sequel: comedic antics, perfect choreography, amazing visuals, exciting action and appropriate drama; James Gunn even knows how to handle a believable romance. There's only one real cringe worthy scene in my view, it's all of ten seconds long and some might not even find it that cringy - it's a somewhat \"playful\" interaction between Starlord and a relative and was either meant to be sarcastic or ended up a little unbelievable.\nNothing about this movie was a letdown and while some reviews seem as though this movie missteps at times or runs too long, I wonder how they felt about Vol 1? This movie is on the upper half of the best MCU movies. I'd suggest they watch the movie again, stop over-analyzing it and just enjoy one of the best cinematic experiences they'll have this year.",

            "content": "The Guardians of the Galaxy sub-franchise of Marvel's behemoth cinematic universe continues to stand as their finest and most unique work, solidified now by the utter blast that is Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. There's still some lingering problems that plague the other movies of the MCU - namely, some humor that just doesn't hit at all, although perhaps that's just inevitable with such a huge influx of it - but in essentially every other aspect, this is a nice change of pace for the formula we've come to expect from Marvel. With all of the character introductions out of the way, James Gunn focuses now on individual character arcs and relationships, and does a solid job of making sure every character has something to do. There's a mighty large cast of characters to juggle at this point, but every one of them has a reason to be involved in the plot, and have meaningful closures for their arcs by the film's end. Even the smallest of characters, like Sean Gunn's Kraglin,have key moments and feel very much welcome in the overarching scheme of things. Baby Groot is probably the single exception to this rule, as yes, he's here mostly for comedic relief and the obvious cute factor, but even he never feels like a blatant merchandising ploy.\n\nAs far as the actual plot goes, it's perhaps the deepest we've seen in the franchise. With Peter Quill and crew coming across the enigmatic Ego, there's all kinds of discussion of family, beyond the idea of a close-knit group of friends being \"family\", fatherhood, and life and death. It's easy to compare it to something like The Empire Strikes Back, as the second entry in a space fantasy franchise that deals primarily with a complicated father-son relationship, and the comparison isn't necessarily invalid, but perhaps the biggest similarity between the two is the focus on emotion and character more than anything else. For all the huge action setpieces and colorful new vistas (it's admittedly nice to see a Marvel with such a wide color palette and distinct visual flair), Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is, simply, a movie. A very well-crafted movie, with a director who has such clear passion for these utterly lovable characters, working with a cast of wonderful actors having the time of their lives playing them. In the ever growing MCU, where every film feels hopelessly tied to one another in some way, it's nice to see a movie that's sole focus is to tell a meanwhile story that stands so strongly on its own. Like the opening song in the film, the skies are looking nice and clear for Mr. Gunn's next endeavor in this universe.",

On with the review....)\n\nWhat a difference a sequel makes. Instead of just being like the first installment and solely offering a \"good time\" on the big screen while jettisoning everything else, James Gunn and co. offer more warmth and more character to go along with the jokes. The viewers can invest in these people and their stories more because more time and care are given to the characters' subplots and their weaknesses. While the jokes are flying fast at the audience, as many (or more) of them fall far from the mark as the ones that do make theatergoers chuckle; most of them worked for me, however. David Bautista, Pom Klementieff, and (especially) Michael Rooker bring joy and life to their roles with excellent performances, whereas Chris Pratt and Bradley Cooper are mostly relegated to utilizing their comedic talents. Unfortunately, that leaves Zoe Saldana's Gamora with little to contribute aside from helping Nebula's (played by Karen Gillen) subplot and stoking the \"will they/won't they\" fire opposite Pratt's Quill/\"Star Lord.\" I did not necessarily find Baby Groot to be as delightful or engaging as the trailers indicated, but at least it did not get as far as annoying, either. Most of the flick's problems are similar to the original movie's issues -\n clumsy storytelling. In the first movie, we dealt with one incomprehensible/confusing and forgettable storyline, but in this film, we have THREE (and honestly, the one about the Sovereigns' and Ayesha's subplot should have been cut). In the end, though, those good elements make this a more successful film than the first volume for me.\n(MAJOR SPOILER BELOW - PROCEED WITH CAUTION!) \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nAnother quibble I have with the movie?

For all the jokes and fun, this one had so much character development that, at times, it felt a bit bloated.\n\nWith that being said, I'm not sure what else they could have done without completely rewriting the plot.\n\nOf the three sets of character arcs that dominate this movie - Peter Quill's, Rocket/Yondu's, and Gamora/Nebula's - only one could have been cut without making the plot nonsensical: Gamora and Nebula's. However, the drama between these two sisters focuses on Thanos, their father. The next time we're going to see the Gaurdians for a full movie is in Infinity Wars, where they fight Thanos. Given that the main cast for that monolith will be in the double digits, most of the characters need have their arcs finished before we get there and thus was the sister's plot necessary from a greater universe standpoint. Plus, it is legitimately interesting so, while I would have preferred to have it held off for another movie, I don't regret that it was in this for any reason beyond pacing issues.\n\nNone of that means that I wouldn't recommend this movie. I saw it with 10 other people and all of us loved it. It's just got some flaws that bare pointing out so that you don't set your expectations too high. If you enjoyed the first one, then you'll enjoy this, too.\n\nSince the soundtrack of the first Guardian's movie is more ionic than the soundtrack of some musicals, I'm sure many will be curious if the sequel maintained earworm status. After much debate, I've decided that it did. While every song in the first movie felt perfectly chosen, there were several in this one that just felt okay. However, the songs that did work, worked far better than any of the ones in the first movie. Nothing from volume one made it onto my playlist while I've already listed to tracks from volume two multiple times.",

The back story of Ego is worth paying attention to, and adds complexity that was not obvious; which is refreshing as story lines are so often dumbed down so much. \n\nPeter Quills character gets the development it needs, as do Gamora and Nebula. Yondu, a character that seemed too complex for the role in the first movie becomes the emotional center of the second, and cements the Ravagers as a deep well of future characters. \n\nBottom line, go see this movie, and if you never saw the first one, view it before you see the second.

While Vol. 1 did create a standard that is hard to match, it felt like its successor didn't even try. I totally get how the movie tried to make us connect to the characters down to a personal level, and it deserves brownie points for that. But that shouldn't be an excuse for a weak plot and a lacklustre villain who never seemed very menacing. The pace, the urgency and an entirely goofy plan to solve problems which worked hilariously well - all of what made Vol. 1 such a success are thoughtlessly missing. Yes, one can argue that the moviemakers don't have to resort to the same gimmicks to make things work, but they should have at least come up with something better if not equally enthralling. Instead, Vol. 2 became a mishmash of character and team building whose sole purpose is perhaps to make them fit in the upcoming Infinity War. Not a total letdown, the sequel does have its moments, but it felt more like a placeholder than a good movie on its own accord.",

            "content": "Fun but slightly disappointing sequel that while doesn't quite match the original, is still well worth viewing.  The cast all returns with to their characters superbly, and developed nicely in new areas, from Gamora & Nebula's bond as sisters to Peter & Rocket's strained friendship.  Of the new additions, Kurt Russell shines as Ego and you instantly buy him as Star Lord's father.  Behind the camera, James Gunn brings lots of the visual thrills & fun of the original, but the story is over-stuffed with too many plot threads.  The middle section is where the movie particularly suffers, when the cast is separated and it just drags.  While it is nice to see some nods for fans, it feels more like a setup for the overall 'Cosmic Marvel Universe', than a movie on it's own.  Thankfully, the final act is action packed with an emotional gut punch at the end, reminding you the Guardians are about people trying to be a family.  Overall, not the classic that is the original, but a bunch of fun and well-worth seeing.",

Pratt is also the one who is expected to deliver a fairly hefty amount of hilarious dialogue, but Pratt's humor is slightly disappointing because it's barely laughable. Not Pratt's fault, his Starlord character is not as well written in Vol 2 as he was in the original. Vol. 2 has its moments of fun. Moments, especially the prison break scene with Rocket and Yondu...and the scene between baby Groot and Rocket and a bomb. These are fun moments, but nothing more than moments, which are very sporadic across a 120 minute plus film. As a whole, sporadic moments do not make this movie worth wild, and Vol. 2 is this.

Some songs not as well known others not as well examined as in this movie. Kurt Russell was welcome addition and Michael Took as Rondu well casted. A shout out to Chris Sullivan (Toby...This is Us) as Laserface...a few other supporting cast members were great also.\n\nRealized how important writing in movies is. Comedic timing as well. I've seen a few badly writ movies lately.  The graphics were mind blowing. From the first scene I am thinking how did they do tgat...throughout movie top shelf seamless wonderment. JJ Abrams move over there's another master director in town. James Gunn, impeccable use if every dpi on the screen.

Telling the story of the quintet of guardians, the script follows the clich\u00e9 of all the films of heroes, but also features some very interesting dramas and sub-plots, which makes it stand out a bit, the film is not completely generic and its minor scope , Of course, that in the whole is common, but \"Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2 \"is a silly film but at the same time passes all seriousness at the right point, his script is good, fun, comic, clich\u00e9 and at the same time different, because his greatest success is to develop the mood of the characters situations, because in question Of history is weak and even forced. Technically the film is very well done, its action scenes are great, although well computerized, its effects do not let it transpire, its makeup is great and the assembly is good, we even have a risky sequence in the film, its soundtrack follows with songs Very good, but without a hit that is the face of the film as in the first, and his rhythm has problems, however fun it is, it tires at a certain moment, something that does not happen with the first. We have to highlight the wide range of actors of name that participated in the film, such as Kurt Russel and Stalone, but even so, there is nothing to be highlighted in terms of acting, except the fluffy Groot that steals the scene whenever it participates . Finally, \"Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2 \"is an extremely entertaining film, full of problems, but with one more thing.",

            "content": "The comic book movie genre and I are in a weird spot these days. After so many years spent following the various releases from the studio, each of which part of or attempting to start a big, shared cinematic universe, it's only natural to hit a point of exhaustion with the genre. One I didn't feel could get elevated.\n\nHowever, the strong quality from the likes of the Lego Batman & Logan more than justified the money spent to go see them. They represent the best qualities of the genre and an example of how just making a movie can do more wonders than assembly line products that're essentially little more than trailers. \n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol 2, from what I heard pre-release, seemed to fit into this category as well. A more creatively driven venture where the scales were smaller and the story far more personnel among other tidbits which gave me hope for a third, strong entry in the 2017 lineup of comic book films.\n\nAnd what a total jackass I was for thinking the third time would be the charm because GotG Vol 2 may just be one of my least favorite movies of the past few years. If you were someone expecting a smaller, more directorially driven movie about fatherhood and the value of family, you have two choices. 1) go fuck yourself or 2) go watch Lego Batman and Logan as they do everything Vol 2 attempts to but with far greater success it only makes the latest MCU venture look worse by comparison.\n\nNot that it isn't perfectly detestable on its own merits because it certainly is. The structure of the film is fucked in a way I've never seen before. The film literally has nothing approaching a plot, story or structure to either besides a generic final blockbuster act that undermines whatever aspirations the film had tried to build up. It feels like someone took a 10 episode season, cut it to shit and then smashed the disparate elements together into a 2-hour film. The end result is a movie that just has stuff happen that are barely connected to one another until bringing them back in one of the worst attempts at a \"let's set em up then knock em down\" attempts I've ever seen. \n\nNow, a non-existent plot can be used to give the characters something to do but the issues are in the multitude in this regard. Almost everyone with the exception of Gamora is an obnoxious caricature of themselves from the first film. If Rocket was a damaged individual who tried to hide it through violence, expect the sociopath angle to get taken to an obnoxious extreme. If Drax was too literal, he is a bonified idiot in this film, not oblivious, a total, borderline pants shitting idiot. So much so he resembles his character the least from the last movie.\n\nBaby Groot is probably the most blatant Disney thing ever to appear in the MCU. He literally has nothing approaching a personality and he's just there to look cute and sell merchandies, he is a big load of nothing at all. Chris Pratt's Star-Lord has fallen into the RDJ trap where he assumes we'll all love him unconditionally just for being here so he reacts to discovering his dad with the same reaction he does to being under attack or being sarcastic: with an expression of constant eye bulging and barely present \"wit\". \n\nThe humor is another major issue that perpetually infuriates. No matter what kind of scene you're watching, whether it's trying to be dramatic or somber or heartfelt or anything, James Gunn will, fucking WILL end it with at least one dumb joke or gag (if God has mercy on your soul) that will totally undermine it. This movie never knows when to shut the hell up and give its audience another reason to care about what's happening. It always thinks it's being funny and clever by infuriating the shit out of you when it isn't: it's just infuriating you.\n\nIt would be one thing if the jokes weren't majoritively cliche or downright obnoxious but they are and good lord does they add to the feeling of tone deafness permeating throughout the whole viewing experience. There is a moment where, and I shit you not, Ego is explaining his loneliness in the cosmos and how he's attempted to overcome it by spreading himself out into the universe only for Drax (because he's a borderline pants shitting retard in this) to ask Ego if he has a dick (yes, really) then go into a bizarre exchange between himself, Peter and Ego about Ego's dick and Ego having sex with Peter's mom. What a way to emotionally invest your audience into the plight of an ancient, lonely God!\n\nNot that you should care because Ego is little more than a cliched cartoon villain, entirely destroying any semblance of nuance concerning the themes of fatherhood and family so the movie can have a boring, mandatory let's blow the hell out of everything climax. \n\nImagine if Logan stayed the exact same for the first two-thirds then the last half hour was some Avengers or MoS level destruction event where everything else that made you invested got its throat slit in favor of a shitty climax that ups the cartoonishness of the proceedings. It literally gets so bad that characters blatantly expose out the morals and parallels between one another. If there is ANY Marvel picture that treats the viewer with obvious contempt on every conceivable level, it is GotG Vol 2. \n\nWhen I finished watching this I asked myself \"What the hell happened and how did I like the first one when the same exact people just shat out something like this?!\". A sequel should never do that, leave you to mind blown in the worst way possible you start to doubt the previous movie(s) you liked and want to rush out and see them again just to convince yourself you weren't snorting some serious cocaine without even knowing it.\n\nWhich is appropriate because the only way you won't want to blow your brains out an hour into this multi-layered disaster of a movie is to BE high as all fucking hell.",

            "content": "*** This review may contain spoilers ***\n\nThe Guardian's of the Glaxy is a film so in love with its own cuteness that it forgets the audience might want something more than, for instance, laughing along with a CGI tree stump dancing across the opening battle with a big pink monster. I welcomed the first movie as new space opera to stand along the Star Wars and star Trek universes but the focus of Vol2 is on character relationships and another Hollywood take on men with Daddy issues.\n\nChris Platt's Star-lord is troubled because he never knew his father, who exists in his memory as a David Hasslehoff look-a-likee. These feelings of loss run so deep that they are given one line of dialogue in which they are established. Cue the arrival of Kurt Russel as 'Ego' Star-Lord's biological dad. Comic book fans will recognize the name from 'Thor' where Ego, as here, is a living planet no less and one of Jack Kirby and Stan Lee's 'God figures'.\n\nNeedless to say, the family reunion doesn't go as planned. I desperately needed to take a leak after scoffing a large piece of coffee cake (oh the joys of diabetes) and chose the films climactic battle to leave the room. I didn't feel I missed much. By then, the film had undercut any involvement by relentlessly using bathetic humour to undermine almost every scene. The script feels afraid that the audience will lose interest in the film if it isn't laughing at itself. This becomes a weird self-fulfilling prophecy. Post the God versus Guardians punch up, we are suddenly asked to engage with a profound revelation - it doesn't matter who your biological dad is, your real father is the man who brought you up - in this case Yondu, the blue finned gang boss who took a paternal if not exactly unselfish interest in Star-Lord and taught him in the ways of ravaging. Now, I am adopted and have met my birth father so I should have been moved by this. I wasn't. Because it was too much to ask me to engage in any depth with characters who had only been taken seriously as straight guys setting up quips, put downs and jokes. \n\nThe sister-act between Gamorah and her angry sibling Nebula would fare better that Peter Quill/Ego conflict because at least the two women are treated seriously. However, audiences forgive me, I couldn't remember who the heck Nebula was or what role she played in the last movie. A quick scan of Nebula's comic book history reveals that I have managed to miss her appearances in the comics. That at least explains why my mind kept confusing her name with Nebulon, 'the celestial man' (sic) another cosmic character. Except that, stop the boat, the film may play with this confusion too because the star beast the Guardian's fight at Vol 2's opening looks a bit like the non-human form of Nebulon - go image search it.\n\nThe wider conflict is between a race of haughty golden people called the Sovereign race who are first helped then scammed by The Guardians - well by Rocket Racoon actually, who takes offense at their upper crust ways and snobbish attitude. Cue a space battle played out as an arcade game, a joke that wears thin even as it is being told, but in case you missed the gag the film tells it again.\n\nBut never mind the plot what about the music? A consideration deemed so important to the film that Marvel's plot outline here promotes it to the first line of its synopsis. Sure, this collection of big, bold but ultimately banal songs helps while away the time and helped me forget the film is only ever moments away from slipping to just the wrong side of terrible (THAT terrible side being the god awful Star Trek V (pun intended). But this is no Tarantino movie sound track. In his films, the music sets up all sorts of frissons. Here, the pop tunes just make the ride pass easier exactly like a tape mix in a car's cassette player (does anyone remember Eight Track?).\n\nIf, after the next Avengers movie, there is a Guardians Vol 3 I can only hope that it takes time to developing its wider fictional universe and has the courage to take that universe a little more seriously- by that I mean respectfully. One of the five in-credit sequences reveals a cocoon containing Adam Warlock, one of my all- time favorite characters, and I want a better world for him to be born into.",

When he was saying it, it sounded a bit like he was actually saying 'I am Gru' as in the villain from Despicable Me. But despite that, I guess it was just part of the little creature's character. There was also another character who was kind of a female villain, she was completely gold but I don't know her name. Anyways, the opening sequence was quite good, there was this monster who wanted to kill them. But there's just something wrong with the ending sequence, the last shot of the film being one of the other characters, Rocket's tears running down his eye.

I'll say this comment continues more thought than James Gunn has put in to the plotting of his screenplay. There's little in the way of plot. Some nice characters get kidnapped by bad characters but end up escaping from bad characters. Bad character tries to kill good character but fails. Different species of nice characters talk then along comes bad characters to spoil these quiet moments. Oh and there's few quite moments in the overlong runtime because this is a noisy, plot less mess of a blockbuster \n\nI also have a bit of a problem with wondering who it's marketed for. It has Russell and Stallone who are legends from the 1980s along with references to KNIGHT RIDER and David Hassellhoff which will mean absolutely nothing to younger audiences and the nature of the film means more discerning mature audiences like myself will be bored by the constant noise and bluster. It also contains a bit too much profanity to work as family friendly fare. I guess this indicates",

It tries very hard to recreate the joyful nonsense of the first volume, but fails consistently, rather targeting one-off jokes than investing in its characters that jump, fall and evade bombs, bullets and lasers like Tom and Jerry in space, with no sense of tread whatsoever. Star-Lord himself, while still central to the \"plot\", seems strangely impersonal, dutifully reacting to events around him rather than guiding the action. The movie takes forever to end and offers no surprises on the way.\n\nAt the end you realize that it has all been nothing but a setup for the next volume, like a cut from an endless Marvel sausage, served shinier than ever but with not much taste.",

The visuals are impressive with most scenes bursting with life through bright and vibrant colours. Chris Pratt is just as charming and humorous as the lead protagonist, Peter Quill, and we see him finally meeting his father, Ego, who is brilliantly portrayed by Kurt Russell. One of the biggest themes of this superhero sequel is family. We see Zoe Saldana's Gamora trying to repair her relationship with her sister, Nebula (Karen Gillian). However, since the previous film, the titular Guardians have become a lot closer and their relationship is enjoyable to watch. In the midst of all the action, romance makes an appearance as Quill tries to develop a relationship with Gamora who is more focused on saving the galaxy and fixing her relationship with her sister. When I first watched 'Guardians of the Galaxy', I wasn't the biggest fan. However, this sequel beat my expectations and I really enjoyed this sequel a lot more than the first. I recommend this to those who like action films and enjoy tongue-in-cheek humour.",

I was looking forward to this for the characters, wit and visuals. Unfortunately, only the visuals were not compromised.\n\nTo be blunt, this movie is not funny, and some of the comedy is cringe-worthy. I felt the length of the film during these scenes. Baby Groot is part of the problem, he loses his appeal after a scene or two, and does nothing interesting the rest of the movie. The gold religion from the trailer doesn't really have their arc resolved at all, and all we get to conclude them is a teaser in the after credits scene. \n\nWhen the characters are just in idle banter, its pretty hit or miss, which is unfortunate considering how funny the first movie is. The characters here feel like a set of traits interacting rather than developed. This just comes back to the script failing to land its comedic beats, which destroys the pacing too frequently. \n\nThere is a good deal to like, particularly visually, but there was far more that I wanted to like but couldn't enjoy.",

Almost every scene filled with forced, cheap gags. Unbelievable and disappointing bad guys who tried to wise crack their through and lost any menace. Acting was poor apart from Yondu and Nebula who was woefully underused.\n\nThis was was like a comedy parody of the first film.

I hope by the 3rd he is full grown.\nGreat to see Kurt Russell in the marvel role, he delivers as always. Zoe Saldana gave a better performance in my opinion, same goes for Dave Bautista, he said he wouldn't stop taking acting lessons after getting this role. \nNo dancing Quill but still the same humor and badass mix as well as more emotional range in his character this time. Rocket of course is Rocket, he is great.\nA little more back story which brings in more dramatic scenes then the first but that is expected also from a sequel in a franchise. However Guardians pattented ability to instantly diffuse tension with humor doesn't fail and in many ways shows itself more then in the 1st.\nCGI is very very heavily used but it is to be expected again and it is top notch. The finale\u00e2?? is a mad house of CGI which is mind blowing if watch in 3D. Still fun and visually awesome to see.\n\nAll in all a great addition to the Guardians franchise.\n\nEnjoy!",

Guy is happy finds dad dad turns out to be a monster tries to destroy galaxy guy saves galaxy. What is so new about it? \n\nThe big guy Dako bullies the Asian girl the whole movie making fun of her innocence. Thank god you are not a parent you would have been a horrible one. Kinda this is the part where I gave up on it. P****d me off real bad. Why? Because she is different? This is what we teach our children?\n\nAnother thing that was disconcerting was the amount of violence towards baby groot. He is a baby for d**n sake it's even in the title yet there is a scene where a lot of pirates are gathered around kicking him like a ball. No wonder he acts like he is retarded. I didn't find him endearing at all I found him sad. He talks and walks yet he can't identify objects. Where is the sense in that?\n\nAnd the whole love dance I love you but you don't love me was just overused and pathetic. I bet they kissed at the end. \n\nAfter all this rant don't waste \u00a317 to go and see it in cinema as it's not worth it.

He's just hanging out.\n\nWithin the first 30 seconds of the movie, it became painful to watch. The lackluster banter between characters reminded me of a bad Seinfeld episode. Within a minute of the film, I was wondering if it might be the biggest loser ever. In all honesty, I don't know because I left about 45 minutes in. All I know for sure is that I was completely disappointed, especially because I loved the fist Guardians so much.\n\nThis is just cashing in, and the writing is absolute trash. There is no way this movie will maintain a score over 6.0 in the long run. If you were extremely eager to see it like I was, change that frame of mind and forget this movie. Maybe then when it hits cable you'll be able to enjoy a few scenes in it as if they were outtakes from the first. Lower your expectations to their lowest possible point, and you might get a chuckle.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 only furthers that notion, stating that this franchise is around for the long haul. Even though it does feel like filler throughout the majority of the film, it's about as good as filler can possibly get. We now find ourselves in the beginning of the preparation phase for the biggest film this franchise will ever have, in Avengers: Infinity War, so most of the films this year will probably feel like an appetizer. The biggest criticism this film has been receiving is the fact that there isn't much of a story present. I have to whole-heartedly disagree on that. Here is why I believe Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is an absolute blast from start to finish. \n\nOn the surface, this film really doesn't have a plot at all, due to the secrecy of certain elements. The trailers for this film give you that it's about the team going on missions, getting tangled up with Peter's biological father, and exploring new parts of the galaxy. When you boil that down, that's not much of a plot to go on, but once you watch the film all the way through and look back on it, the plot is pretty obvious. For the sake of a twist, the plot details are kept under wraps, so I won't get into any spoilers. I thought that was a very bold move by writer/director James Gunn, because he could've easily lost the interest of his viewers. Once the plot of the film becomes apparent, I thought the film became great, and that is not the fanboy in me trying to defend this franchise. I throughly enjoyed this film from beginning to end. \n\nIn the first film, the standouts were easily Groot and Rocket Raccoon, and even though they definitely capitalize on the fact that Groot is a baby in this film (which is incredibly loveable by the way), the standouts to me were all the side characters. From Yondu to Mantis, this film gives enough for these characters to do, making audiences love pretty much every single character on-screen, which is very hard to accomplish. Drax is definitely utilized as the comedic relief throughout the majority of this film, more so than the first, which was fine by me. If you go this film to gawk at baby Groot, laugh at endless jokes, enjoy some action, and especially to connect on a very emotional level with each of these characters, I think you'll be satisfied. \n\nAt its core, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a character study, plain and simple. Where I think the biggest flaw lies with this film and where I can see many people dozing off, is the fact that there are quite a lot of scenes involving characters opening up to each other in order to explore everyone's backstory in depth. For myself, I was fully invested in these scenes and thought it only added to the emotional impact. It can definitely feel like a film with a bunch of scenes slapped together, which is how I feel some people may view this film, but I thought it was great. It's pretty ballsy to make a film solely on character development, but when that is the goal and the end result is this good, you won't ever find me complaining. \n\nIn the end, if you're not aware that this film is going to be much more of a character study than anything, then please take this as a warning, because there is a lot of it. Filled with much more emotion than the original, much more comedy, and some pretty exciting action sequences, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a great follow-up to its predecessor. Although lacking the stronger story that was held by the first, this film makes up for it in every other way. I won't be able to score this film quite as highly as the original, simply due to the fact that the freshness level isn't quite on par. That being said, I left this film feeling completely satisfied from the amount of emotion and entertainment I received. I can't wait to see more from these characters. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is more than worth the price of admission and is among the best of the sequels to come from the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",

The cast is great again, with tremendous chemistry to go around and Kurt Russell fits in well alongside them with his \"rugged good looks\" and arrogant charm. I didn't particularly care for the other, new characters but that does not mean they were bad, just less impressive. In volume two we are given what feels like more comedy and larger than life action than the first one. However, this time around the movie is not as fresh or original like the ?one preceding it, which had come out of nowhere and was a huge success. The famous Walkman played soundtrack is still fun yet seemingly less memorable than the first one.

What sells the first Guardians of the Galaxy for me is the chemistry between the group, and the back-and-forth they all have. The way Gunn writes these characters, and how he layers the dialogue to create a perfect symphony is incredible. And we got that for the first third of this movie. Then, the characters split up. While what each of them were doing was interesting enough, that comradery and that chemistry was missing. It left a hole in the movie, and the static energy of go go go came to a halt. I don't think these characters are compelling enough on their own. If we ever got a Drax (Dave Bautista) or a Gamora (Zoe Saldana) spin-off film, I don't think it would work. Even Star-Lord. It's when they're together, and they are playing off of each other, that's when they are incredibly compelling.

            "content": "While the visuals are a step up from the first, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 caves under a weak plot and overall bad writing. You COULD rename the movie as \"Guardians of the Galaxy: How to be a Family\", because its the obvious overarching theme that isn't even creatively presented. Everything is so bottlenecked into this idea (sister-sister relationship, father-son relationship, outcast-outcast relationship, etc. etc.) I had to wonder if I was watching a movie or listening to a sermon. The result is a team dynamic with this veneer of empathy to cover up the fact that no real evolution of the characters have happened since the first movie. \n\nThe humor in GotG2 is also something which feels forcibly shoved to the forefront of the movie. Joking and sarcasm appear with such frequency they effectively deaden the situations where there's a \"serious\" emotional moment. It's not believable, and it's hard to take anything that happens seriously because of it. And the humor? Not really that funny, with a good portion banking off the cute-ness of a Baby Groot to the point of my own physical pain. The amount of sexual jokes eclipse the latest Power Rangers movie, further alienating the franchise from younger audiences (very strange, considering all this Baby Groot movie time) and successfully transported me back to fifth grade. If the theater wasn't packed with people, and I wasn't wearing my Cinco De Mayo cowboy boots, I would have left the theater- that's the honest truth.\n\nIF the movie would have focused more on the action and visual elements, even without improving the story and humor, it would have been a much stronger movie. There are some awesome space fights, environments, and an interesting alien race introduced. And not all the funny was unfunny; there is some good comedic writing peppered within everything that wasn't. Even so, Guardians 2 is a bit of a galactic mess for the stated reasons, aside also from the inconsistency in plot/characters/emotions, and the increased vulgar language which comes across as \"we can do what we want, we're cool, yo\". Well yo-- pay me next time to watch your movie, cool?",

Overall, it's certainly enjoyable - lots of humor - but, for me, I left the theater disappointed... But these are MY thoughts and everyone is different.

There is a bigger focus on comedy this time around and a lot of it hits, but a good amount of it made me role my eyes, particularly most of the Drax comedy. While this chapter isn't nearly as compelling as Volume 1, it's a welcome entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",

The humor just didn't hit as hard because after a while you can start to feel the pattern of james gunns comedic beat and start anticipating punchlines before they happen. The plot kicking in in the last act also makes the film seem a bit episodic. The music (both soundtrack and score) felt extremely forced in as well. But my biggest negative has to be the visual effects, at times it felt as if i was watching Spy Kids 3D, james gun abandoned practical sets and stunts in favor of just using greenscreen which makes everything look staged and so fantastical that in ungrounds the film from reality.",

It's almost more of an extension of the original movie than a sequel, bringing everything I liked about the first one and giving me more of it. Great, consistently colorful and diverse cinematography that reflects the cosmic-era marvel comics that it is based on. Great performances all around, but Michael Rooker and Kurt Russell are standouts. Also, the young Kurt Russell at the beginning of the movie was shockingly good, which is for some reason the norm with Marvel (similar to little Captain America/young Tony Stark.) a fantastic addition to the MCU.",

Going in to Volume 2, I had fairly high hopes and the movie ended up meeting those very nicely.  Volume 2 captures the characters and dynamic from the original and dives down into multiple levels of their interactions, motives and desires.  The movie is visually stunning and the character developments and arcs are meaningful and fulfilling.  The same humor is captured in Volume 2 and even cranked up to 11, landing many jokes and tropes that are inches away from flopping.  Because the characters push the envelope a bit more (in a creative, not crude, way) with their banter, Gunn is able to really capture a lot of the secret sauce from the first installment.  A few jokes fall flat or pop back up when they didn't need to but it didn't take away from the overall pleasure.  Because the characters were the main focus, the actual plot of the movie did not capture me quite as easily.  In fact, because Ego is an actual planet, much of the plot and locations are not really a plot or location but it's another character.  For most of the movie, it didn't really concern me where the guardians were or what was going to happen next.  What mattered to me was hanging on to every word from every character because the meaning and purpose of the movie was to dive deep into the team.  With that said, the progression of any real accomplishments falls a bit short.  Instead we are left feeling an extremely strong connection with the guardians, happy to see where they are at now and how much they themselves have grown since the first movie and even more after this second movie.  Because of this strong relationship, stems the desire for more galaxy saving.",

At some points, his lack of depth or care is the vehicle for some of this franchise's best humor, which stands in strong juxtaposition to what seem like some Hamlet moments in this installment.  While I thought Kurt Russell was awesome in the movie, I think him as a planet/god actually saddled the movie a bit.  I really liked the comparison of Ego to Yondu as father figures.  Some of the references (Mary Poppins and Pacman) were awesome....loved them.  And the tape bit and Taser face bits were great too.  In the end the viewer is tossed between \"take me seriously\" and \"don't take me seriously\", which I thought was better balanced in the first one and less so in this one.

            "content": "\"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\" (PG-13, 2:16), much like its predecessor, is one of the most creative movie mash-ups ever. When I reviewed the original, I noted how much it had in common with \"Star Wars\". My 2014 review called it, \"a movie about a group of rebels of different races getting together to save a planet from the power of a mysterious deadly orb,\" described the group as including \"a good-looking outlaw pilot who is used to only thinking of himself, a large brown creature who makes sounds that others seem to understand as a sort of language, a tough woman with a royal background who has no patience for nonsense and a small, wise creature who provides guidance to the others,\" and noted that the group had to \"battle an evil henchman with warped religious ideas who dresses in black and only answers to an even more powerful evil being who always seems to be sitting in a big chair.\"  To all that, add significant daddy issues and you have the Guardians films. Well, plus aspects of \"Star Trek\" (discovering strange new worlds), \"Independence Day\" (several people playing crucial roles in defeating interstellar evil) and even \"The Fast and the Furious\" (a diverse group of friends regarded as family).\n\nAnd let's not forget that Guardians is a Marvel property. \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\" is the 15th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The movie contains Easter eggs tying it to other Marvel film franchises and hints at future cinematic overlap. In terms of how this one fits with the others chronologically, according to IMDb, \"the film takes place in 2014, 3 months after Guardians of the Galaxy (2014). It takes place a year after Thor: The Dark World (2013). Before or after Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) and a year before Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015).\" Speaking of Tony Stark's cohorts, shortly before the first Guardians movie was released, Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger said that the goal with this franchise was actually to create \"another Avengers\". The Guardian series does have that feel to it, along with some of the comic sensibilities of \"Deadpool\", another Marvel film franchise born in the mid-2010s. Now, having said all that (and ensuing cinematic cross-pollination notwithstanding), the Guardians movies have definitely created their own niche within the MCU - and their own sense of fun.\n\nPicking up just months after the action in the original, \"Vol. 2\" sees Peter Quill / Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) and Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) adjusting to their newfound fame, their role as galaxy guardians and the dynamics of (and their individual places within) this team - slash - family unit. Early on, four of them battle a monster known as the Abilisk (looking like a much bigger and angrier Jabba the Hutt - with tentacles)... while Groot dances to Quill's music. A gold-colored race of people known as the Sovereign reward the Guardians for defeating Abilisk - and protecting the special batteries that it was trying to steal - by turning over a prisoner, Nebula (Karen Gillan), Gamora's estranged sister, who has a bounty on her head. As the Guardians leave the Sovereign, Rocket steals some of those valuable batteries. The insult of such a theft sends Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki) into a rage and she sends her fleet of remotely-piloted drones after Rocket and company. Due to some nifty flying - and a little help from a mysterious ship which suddenly comes to their aid - the Guardians survive, but crash land on an unfamiliar planet.\n\nThat mysterious ship lands on the planet too and out steps a being called Ego (Kurt Russell)... who claims to be Quill's father! Ego's story seems to check out, so Quill, Gamora and Drax let Ego take them back to his planet so Quill can spend some time with his pops. Rocket is left behind to repair the ship, take care of Baby Groot and keep an eye on Nebula. As Quill and friends get to know Ego - and Mantis (Pom Klementieff), Ego's pet empath (a being who can experience the feelings of other people by touching them and even temporarily alter those feelings), Rocket has to defend against an attack by Yondu Udonta (Michael Rooker) and his crew of Ravegers, whom Ayesha has hired to retrieve the batteries and kill the Guardians. The Ravegers capture Rocket and Groot, but Yondu's reluctance to pursue Quill leads to a mutiny by Yondu's crew. His lieutenant, who calls himself Taserface (Chris Sullivan), imprisons Yondu, Rocket and Groot, gets rid of those loyal to Yondu and teams up with Nebula to catch up with the rest of the Guardians, who, in the meantime, have run into some pretty serious trouble of their own. \n\n\"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\" has a better plot and visuals and is even more fun than the original. In the first movie, the Guardians became a family, but in this one, they have to learn how to BE a family - while Quill and Gamora each have to deal with serious conflicts stemming from their own original families. Freed from the confines of establishing the Guardians' cinematic world and forming their relationships gives returning writer/director James Gunn the freedom to do more interesting things with the story - and the characters, which are now more developed - and more entertaining - especially Groot, who's as adorable as any Minion, but much tougher (which also happens to be pretty adorable). The music is great, while the scenery is vibrant and the action is exciting (and deserving of 3D viewing). Sometimes, there's almost too much going on... visually, but also aurally, as the sound effects and music compete for attention with the dialog. As a whole, Vol. 2 is a good step forward for the franchise and (with help from five short scenes and embedded graphics during and after the closing credits) builds anticipation for more Guardian adventures, including some Marvel-ous crossover action. \"B+\"",

The story was better than the original Guardians. I left the original disappointed, but learned to like it after watching it with the kids a few more times. The story was funny, it built on introducing a very important character. It gave closure, even though it was painful. This is officially my third favorite movie in the universe. I am hoping this is a trend to continue with 2017 with Spider-Man and Thor. Drax was very funny, Rocket showed why he was a comic bad-ass, and Groot was not over powering the storyline. Yondu was vindicated and it sets up the story for a great Infinity War premise. Another great issue was no Thanos. Kurt Russell was great as Ego and that was the best part of the film.

It's just a movie. \n\nOkay, now I got that joke out of the way...\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy is a superhero film produced by the Marvel Studios and directed by James Gunn, it is a sequel and it is the fifteenth film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. \n\nThe story is follows up on the team of Guardians of the Galaxy, consisting of Peter Quill (Star-Lord), Gamora, Rocket, Drax, and....Baby Groot, where they later get Nebula from the Sovereign race in trade of protecting special batteries from getting stolen. Let's skip to a certain part where they somehow split the team because Star-Lord meets the dad and Rocket and Baby Groot somehow was led into some other adventure with Yondu. \n\nIn the first half of the film, I think it felt as if the film is missing all the action the first movie have but it felt better later in the second half because a huge spoiler happens near the conclusion. What kept the first half of the movie flowing were the ongoing jokes coming from Rocket and Drax. Maybe pit Bradley Cooper and Dave Bautista together for a comedy. But that is why I'll give this a 4/5 for because of that second half of the film. Yondu did his part really well and you would wish to see more parts from him and Rocket together. \n\nSnake Plissken.....I mean Ego, played by Kurt Russell, revealed his role well and you need to see how much of a father figure he is to Star-Lord. In parts, you would see a young version of Kurt Russell, yes, that CGI they did with Rogue One at the end was done again in this film. It was well played. \n\nVolume 2 is better than the first but I might give the first the better of the action sequences. The ongoing jokes and the near-conclusion of the film were pretty much how I felt that I'll pass this movie with a B+. If added the action in the first half with all that element leading towards the end, maybe it'd be worthy of an A+. No seriously, I wanted to see Drax fighting more, it felt he was limited in a lot of places. This is a good Marvel movie, it's not one of the best Marvel movie, not even because of that huge spoiler near the end.",

The fact that they are bringing to life some of the characters that they are is pretty remarkable, especially when we haven't even seen such important characters like Captain Marvel and Nova yet. The movie uses humor, music, as well as excellent character development to make the movie a fun time for the people who genuine do not care about these cosmic adventures. The script is written to be palatable by those who are \"alien\" to the comic references, while still slipping them in when they can. So overall, I'm head over heels with this sequel\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 did a great job introducing some key comic book characters. I was excited to see Yondu and Nebula coke back. Mantis is a great addition to the team. I thought that the presence of some other members of the GOTG from the older comics (Starhawk, Martinex, and Charlie-23) was a great check in the box, but I'd love to see more of them in the next GOTG. Besides not actually being Peter's dad, Ego was a delight to see in the film. Howard the Duck shows up yet again. The Watcher shares the screen in another great Stan Lee cameo. Ayesha was a great way to introduce Adam Warlock, if maybe a little late.",

It's a fun movie with some pretty hot space babes(especially the Asian one, Mantis) and a satisfying enough ending.

There are a few sketchy moments and a few disturbing/ scary imagery that might not be appropriate for kids  younger than 10 IMO.  Still a very pleasing movie that further develops the characters.

Starlord (Pratt) meets his birth father, Ego (Kurt Russel) and about his destiny. I don't want to delve into any details, so I'll leave it at that.\n\nThe first GotG film was surprisingly entertaining. Gunn proved that an unknown property could become a fan favorite under the right direction. That first film was full of humor and explosions, and the second film, for better or worse, cranked those factors up to 11.\n\nVol. 2 does a lot of things that a sequel should do; it developed established characters, introduced new ones, and gave backstories to previously one-dimensional supporting characters. There are multiple stories throughout this movie: Starlord's lineage, Gamora's relationship with her sister, Nebula (Karen Gillan), Rocket's meaning in life, and the backstory of Yondu (Michael Rooker). Of all of these stories, I found Yondu's to be the most compelling. His character was a dispensable goon in the first film, but we find out more about his life and relationship with his squad and with Starlord.\n\nThe action was bigger and brighter, but it worked in this film due to the raised stakes. Most of the time, sequels want to be bigger and badder because the budget lets them. In this case, the way the plot works allows the visual effects to be over-the-top in a meaningful way.\n\nThe humor was in full-effect this time. I enjoyed most of it, but it definitely seemed like they were trying really hard to capture the magic of the first film. Some of the jokes really fell flat. There was a sequence where Yondu and Rocket were traveling through space to reach Starlord, and the animation and humor were downright childish. It just felt like they wrote in two or three jokes too many.\n\nThe tone of the film was also all over the place. One scene will be action-packed and full of those humorous quips, but the next would be expositional dialogue that felt like a soap opera. There just wasn't a good balance between the two, and it was a bit shell-shocking when the tone would take a dramatic shift.\n\nOverall, this sequel does a lot of things right. While it isn't as engaging as the first film, Vol. 2 offers a great story with deep character development and fun action. Go see it!\n\nFinal grade: B+",

All actors did a great job in bringing the story to life and completed this second film amazingly. \n\nI am excited to see the next film which I predict will be about who you want to be, to continue the introspective personal development theme.",

The main antagonist is promising at first but takes on a giant, nebulous form in the end that causes you to lose interest.

            "content": "The film opens with Kurt Russell in the 1980s as we see him and Peter Quill's mother saunter off into the forest behind a Dairy Queen to be all lovey dovey. It's a nice, little slice of romantic melodrama, giving us a kind of Starman vibe. The dialogue isn't so important, as much as Russell's perfectly feathered hair (a stand-out of the film, if there ever was one). Also impressive is the technology used to make Russell nearly 40 years younger.  It's only after the film is over that we realize this scene is all but pointless, except that Marvel has a penchant for showing us characters digitally enhanced to look younger. I dare say, the real opening of the film is when we catch up with our Guardians as they're on their latest job, following a dancing Baby Groot as the rest of the team tries to take down a beast with rows of razor sharp teeth who wants to feed on . . . batteries? Sure, why not?\n\nThe opening of the film is the best part, if only to be re-introduced to the characters we know and love from the first. There's no MacGuffin as obvious as an infinity stone this time around, so the movie takes its time revealing the main crux of its story. We follow three separate plot threads as Chris Pratt's Peter Quill, Zoe Saldana's Gamora and Dave Bautista's Drax go with Ego (Russell), a celestial being with the ability to create life and planets who claims to be Peter's father. Meanwhile, Rocket and Groot are kidnapped by Michael Rooker's Yondu and his Ravagers, only to contend with a mutiny on-board pitting Yondu against his own men. Nebula is thrown in the mix too so that her and Gamora can love-hate each other in an arc that wraps up with a pointless action scene that could've been avoided with one conversation (or more cleverly, incorporated into the climax). But, ya know, action quota.\n\nSuffice it to say that Volume 2 is more about its characters than an actual threat to the galaxy, and it may have worked too if the material was as strong as the first. As is the case with most sequels, it is not, and writer/director James Gunn has amped up the melodrama and ridiculousness to soap opera-esque levels of character development. Whether we're watching Quill re-unite with his dad, Gamora's relationship with Nebula, or Yondu's dedication to the now farcical Ravagers, the story is really about every character and their daddy issues.\n\nAnyone who's seen a Star Trek episode on their life will see where this story is going and while I won't spoil it, the ultimate villain of the film offers up some great drama for our heroes . . . that James Gunn never really takes advantage of. In fact, he doesn't seem to set up a proper arc for any of our characters. There's \"payoffs\" sprinkled throughout the film without any set-up. When a payoff isn't earned, it's no payoff at all and sticks out like a sore thumb. There's a lot of sore thumbs in Vol. 2. I can't really get into any specifics without spoiling it, but Gunn seems content to give most of the characters of the film some special denouement, and none of them work. Of all the characters, Peter Quill is the most boring of the bunch which just baffles my mind given the story at hand. That's a real shame in a film that's trying real hard to focus on its characters, and not of the titular galaxy. Speaking of, the film feels claustrophobic, as it's confined to our small group of heroes, the Ravagers, and Ego. Sure, there's the golden people seen in the beginning, the Sovereign, but they only show up to be the butt of a joke or pad up the action quota. At no point in the film do they ever stand out as an actual threat, and their inclusion into the film's climax didn't alter the events what-so-ever.\n\nRegarding the climax, I'm very critical of watching characters shoot at/fight CG bullshit for long periods of time, and holy hell, does this film not know when to pull back. I suppose the ending is Gunn's attempt to make up for an entire film filed with lackluster action sequences (there's only so much of Yondu's flying arrow I can take before the novelty wears off) but the third act goes on for what feels like an eternity. If the series could ever jump the shark, that moment happens here in a bit that feels \"inspired\" by Adam Sandler's Pixels. Yeah, it's that bad. By the time the villain is taken care of (spoilers?), you really don't want to sit around for another 15 minutes, waiting for the film to wrap up. Sadly, that's exactly what happens in the most ham-fisted of emotional climaxes.\n\nThe first film was deft in slipping in some of the film's more dramatic moments, and didn't overstay it's welcome. I mean, Guardians of the Galaxy really caught everyone off-guard with its characters and a story that, while delivering exactly what'd you want in a space opera, did it in such a way that felt fun and unexpected. Vol. 2 is none of those things. Some of the humor and situations work, because we love the characters, but it's all telegraphed well in advance. This sequel pushes things to be much more over the top than the first in most departments (except for the action) and while it's entertaining at first, it gets old pretty fast.\n\nGunn has a unique style that fit the first film like a glove - everything really came together. Vol. 2 feels like it's trying too hard to capture what made the first film so unique and special. I think that everyone's admiration for the characters will really keep this film from falling by the wayside, but it's never-the-less a disappointing entry for our Guardians of the Galaxy.",

If you suspend your critical plot-hole poking minds then moments like the faces being stretched during space jumps, and spray painting on new metal become enjoyable and bring a classic Guardians of the Galaxy feel. If you do not suspend then you probably judge these moments as unbelievable and going too far. A sequel focusing on character development over plot is NOT a bad thing, and that is what this movie is. The interpretation from the comics was already a stretch combing the characters of Ego and Peter's real dad, combining this character again with the mighty being it does is a stretch on the plot, but a welcome surprise to a viewer who believes they know what to expect. Cameos, bit parts, and fan service is rampant, and the tease for Guardians volume 3 promises another unique plot for our heroes. An even brighter colored universe with deeper character dimensions tripping into a save the world scenario with more of the same comedy only pushed to it's limits a handful of times, the show is stolen by new characters Mantis and the additional screen time and lines given to Nebula and Drax.",

            "content": "In 2014, Marvel took a chance at a fairly unknown series in their canon named Guardians of the Galaxy and unleashed it as part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It felt fresh and exciting for the superhero genre and made star Chris Pratt a bona fide action star. Three years later, the sequel is here to make fans laugh all over again. Chris Pratt leads our group of Guardians as Peter Quill/Star-Lord alongside Gamora (Saldana), Drax the Destroyer (Bautista), feisty Rocket (Cooper), and the adorable little tree Groot (Diesel) who are fighting off a gigantic slug with razor sharp teeth on the planet of Sovereign. Despite killing the slug they find themselves in quite the bind with High Priestess Ayesha (Debicki) on a planet where everything and everyone is gold. Gamora is confronted with her sister Nebula (Gillan) who has a bounty placed upon her on another planet. There is no love lost between the sisters. Meanwhile, Rocket steals some coveted batteries on the planet sending Ayesha off attacking the Guardians as they try to flee. The Guardians crash land on another planet barely escaping Ayesha's warriors. They've also been followed by another ship through this portal. The pilot of this mysterious vessel is Ego (Russell), Peter's father whom he hasn't seen since childhood. His guard is up and not ready to trust his father who left his mother many years ago. The question remains as to why Ego has taken it upon himself to find Peter all of a sudden. I could go with divulging more about the various plotlines involved in Vol. 2, but I don't want to overly complicate things that could wind up being spoilers.\n\nWithin the film's first opening moments, writer and director James Gunn, who also conceived the first film, reminds the audience why the Marvel Cinematic Universe sets itself apart from the DC movies. I sat back with a big grin and chuckled along with the bickering among Peter and his crew. Gunn then takes time to shift the action a bit by focusing in on little Baby Groot who is off dancing to his own rhythm when there is a big monster right behind him. To compliment his cuteness is Bradley Cooper voicing Rocket who is full of attitude and opinions. Cooper is so memorable and dynamic as Rocket that I'm still contemplating if this is his best role to date. Is that fair given it's an animated hero versus his edgier work with David O. Russell or Clint Eastwood?\n\nMarvel has done well by making their sequels work just as well, if not better, than their predecessors. Once we move past the introductory stories, we can start having more fun and experiment with the characters. That's precisely what Gunn has done as you can tell by that opening scene. He has written a witty and playful sense of humor with nearly every major character given their time to shine with a snappy comeback or retort back to their adversary. The script is also chock full of pop culture references throughout including bits about Cheers, Mary Poppins, and David Hasselhoff. Back again is the catchy rock music that fills the soundtrack as Peter turns on his cassette of \"Awesome Mix 2\" for inspiration.\n\nLike most sequels, everything is bigger and more lavish in Vol. 2. I often lament about the overreliance on CGI and special effects when practical sets and effects could be utilized. This is that rare example where they were used exceptionally well to the point where I was never distracted by it. The costumes, make-up, and production design are exploding with color and texture in every frame. They fit right in with the galactic tone without looking cartoony. There are plenty of dynamic action sequences yet none of them felt like they were dragged out for too long like we've seen in some of the Marvel or DC movies. James Gunn raises the stakes for our heroes by making them reaffirm what the idea of family means to them. Peter's reunion with Ego is front and center as well as his relationship with the paternal Yondu (Rooker), while Gamora and Nebula test their definition of sisterhood. In a broader sense, the Guardians have a family unit among themselves and are constantly reminded that, despite their differences, they are an unbreakable force when united for the common good.\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is another highly entertaining outing for Marvel. James Gunn is fully aware of the story and world they have created and have fun with it. It sets out to be an entertaining ride that never takes itself too seriously. It starts to feel a bit long and stretched out in the middle due to the various plotlines which has our team separated but regains its momentum once a big character reveal occurs. It's great to be back with these characters again, especially scene-stealers Rocket and Baby Groot. Rocket's wiseass cracks yield some of the biggest laughs, and it's hard not to adore the cuteness overload in the animation given to Baby Groot and Vin Diesel's various intonations of \"I am Groot!\" Kurt Russell is a great addition to the cast as he easily dips into his ultra-cool persona as Ego. He's having a highly successful year thanks to this and starring in The Fate of the Furious. Make sure to stay through all of the credits, as there are five post-credit sequences and the announcement that \"The Guardians will return.\"\n\nIs It Worth Your Trip to the Movies? Will no doubt please fans, but also those growing tired of the genre\n\nRATING: 4 out of 5 TICKET STUBS",

But I couldn't. There is just too much wrong with it.\nDon't get me wrong, it's not a horrible movie. It actually is quite enjoyable. But coming from GOTG1 and then being confronted with THIS is just... heartbreaking.\n!!!SPOILER WARNING!!!\nThere was just too much crammed into there, story-wise. Three villains (Taserface, the Sovereign, Ego) of which two were completely useless and just cheap trigger elements for even cheaper plotlines. If they wanted to make Yondu get detached from the Ravagers, they could have done so without using Taserface, who was just a waste of screentime. Instead of focusing on him or the Sovereigns, the movie should have focused solely on the emotional interactions between the main characters. The story of Peter and his two dad figures, and of Gamora and Nebula would have been enough to fill out the movie and should have been explored deeper and better. A simple \"LOOK DADDY, I MADE A BALL, LET'S PLAY AND BE BEST FRIENDS!!\" hardly does the situation of meeting your long lost dad justice. \nInstead, each character gets a storyline that is poorly explained or resolved because there is just not enough time. The dynamics between Gamora and Nebula are turning around 90\u00b0 without further reason. Nebula just suddenly feels like she wants a sister instead of killing Gamora. That Gamora wanted to be her sister through GOTG1 all the time doesn't seem to matter anymore. Drax is not even doing anything in the movie but delivering bad jokes. Rocket and Yondu develop a friendship that makes sense and would be really cool if it wasn't just rushed through and explained by \"they broke out of their cell together and on the way Yondu notices Rocket is exactly like him and shares his soft side with him even though he hasn't showed this side to anyone else, not even Peter\". Groot is another case of \"We need more jokes\". \nNo. This movie doesn't need more jokes. It needs more body. There were TOO MANY jokes, in fact. And poor ones, really. Ego turning into David Hasselhoff in the most emotional part of the entire movie completely ruined the mood and the seriousness of the moment. Peter turning into Pacman to battle him ruined a perfectly good showdown. Yondu, Kraglin and Rocket turning into horrible CGI-cartoon-monsters was so embarassing that I wanted to die in my chair. This had nothing to do with the heart-lifting, dorky humour of GOTG1, this was exaggarating at its finest. The entire scene with Groot searching for Yondu's fin could have been cut out or at least shortened to 1/3 of its length to make room for more important things, like character development. \nAlso Mantis was just... there. Why she would suddenly become a part of the Guardians remains a mystery and has to be explained by the viewer themself. I mean, it took the entire first movie to bring the 5 jerks together, now this movie rushes through every new dynamic like a speed-train.\nAll in all, this movie took awesome characters and extremely powerful dynamics and potential, just to overlay it with a bunch of too much and too bad jokes, throw another bunch of useless characters and plot devices in, and then mix it up until you are permanently torn between \"Give me more of this, why isn't there more?\" and \"Why does this EXIST, my brain bleeds!\"\nSo no, this is not GOTG for me. GOTG1 had a completely different and far better vibe, it was clever, funny, emotional, had A+ characters and a thrilling story. THIS movie is just a CGI fest that makes you question the characters you learned to love dearly from GOTG1 and also makes you question James Gunn, his humour, and his ability to treat his own characters right. It's alright, but nothing more. Don't expect to be blown away by it.",

            "content": "I've fallen so far behind on my reviews, I have eight films I've seen prior to Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 and I've seen Vol.2 twice already! I wanted to do a rewind review of the first Guardians the of Galaxy before also, but time has not been kind (plus, admittedly, I've been a little lazy, it happens okay.) But, this can't wait any longer, especially with it getting it's US release this weekend! \n\nI loved the first, and James Gunn proves that he can do it again, putting the cool back into awesome, and the awesome back into epic proportions. I actually appreciate the prequel more having watched this, but, I have to say I wasn't convinced at first viewing and only actually fully appreciated it more after watching the first again before hitting the IMAX  \n\nYou need to have seen the first to know who's who. It's where each character gets introduced and this film jumps straight in there after and like the first, there's a great balance between all the heroes. In fact, this one embellishes on the heroes key traits, like Drax's literally sense of humour and Rocket's mischievous gadgetry, he's more lethal than MacGyver locked inside a Walmart. \n\nNow the Guardians are established and have set up shop as mercenaries for hire they quickly go about running errands for interplanetary employers, until Quill's father makes himself known; and it isn't J'son, who was originally Quill's dad in Marvel lore. Let's just say Gamora and Nebula aren't the ones with serious father issues. \n\nA lot of questions get answered here, and at first, I use to be annoyed when films didn't stick to the canon, but now, I've actually warmed to it, as long as it's a good twist. Otherwise how boring would it be for true marvel fans to already know what's going to happen. Like metaphors for Drax, many of these cameos, references and twists go over viewers heads but spurs intrigue and awe in the avid comic book fans. Like the appearance of the original Guardians of the Galaxy (that included Yondu) the mention of Adam, which can only mean Adam Warlock and the Watchers standing with Stan Lee during the portal jumps which has triggered some very interesting theories about all of Lee's cameos. \n\nIt proves that GotG are in good hands with both writers and director, this one being a giant step in the right direction. Though, there's no connection to the incoming Infinity Wars yet which will possibly wait until vol.3 or, keeping the fans guessing, maybe somewhere else in the MCU. My money is actually on Thor: Ragnar\u00f6k, seeing as Goldblum's Grandmaster appears during the colourful disco credits. \n\nSomething else that'll be wasted on younger audiences, not that it's a criticism, purely an observation, but the constant references to 80's pop culture which seems to make up most of Pratt's lines. It brings a smile to us older viewers understanding Quill's analogies but kids not familiar with the source might be left guessing. Still, there's plenty for the kids, enough naughty humour like hinty curse words that feels like it's winking at the younger audience, with the right eye. \n\nIt actually goes Fast and Furious, almost ripping off, \"I ain't got friends, I've got family\" line. But you really do get that vibe of misfit unison and the unlikely alliances grows even more with Gamora's sibling rivalry and Yondu's supposed change of heart earning some surprising sympathy. The daring silliness doesn't stop there but is done in brilliant comic fashion. It does breach the realms of silliness above and beyond a cybernetic raccoon and a walking, taking (with limited vocabulary) sequoia. Pacman makes an appearance, I so wanted Quill to do a hadouken and there's a scene that's goes all Ren & Stimpy which makes Groot yak. Not forgetting to mention Zardu Hasselfrau. \n\nProbably the star of this film is Baby Groot who just oozes incredible cuteness no matter what he's doing, whether he's beating on Drax, dancing to tunes or eating M&Ms. No one can deny wanting a baby Groot for themselves after watching this (I've renamed my jade plant after him.) I also think Quill takes the back seat to Rocket and even Yondu on this venture. \n\nThe action is superb with Rocket's comical booby trapping, the dogfights and especially Yondu's and  company's escape. His whistling arrow has to be one of the greatest weapons in the know universe. All accompanied by an awesome soundtrack. It seems Rocket has inherited Quill's affection for the funky soul soundtrack, himself, a number of times actually having music on while they work as a priority. Having watched it both in 2D and IMAX, I favour the IMAX version strongly as the film's vibrant visual effects are stunning with plenty of opportunities to show off what IMAX can do. It's superbly paced for a 136min runtime, it doesn't drag at all and I could have happily sat there and watched more, I want more. \n\nYou can't talk about this film without mentioning the soundtrack as it plays an integral part of the film, especially with that comical and adorable opening using ELO's \"Mr. Blue Sky\", Jay & The American's \"Come a Little Bit Closer\" playing during the arrow massacre, Sweet's \"Fox on the Run\", Fleetwood Mac's \"The Chain\" and a touching use of Cat Stevens' \"Father & Son\". Zardu Hasselfrau, sorry! I mean David Hasselhoff featuring not just in the film but on the soundtrack too, pretty much reprising his duties from Kung Fury and leads me to predict an appearance in the coming Baywatch film. Tyler Bates returns to do his score, but it does get overplayed by the soundtrack. It's definitely, by far, the best soundtrack out of all of the Marvel films, but it's been the only one really been allowed the freedom to rock out, apart from Iron Man maybe. \n\nThe whole production and marketing is quite unique, clearly being the coolest out of the franchise bringing back everything that was awesome about 80's film posters. One of which being a copy of Ramones' \"Rocket to Russia\" album cover which is genius and some out of the many promo prints looking like trading cards. Even the trailer is smartly cut together not giving anything away being a mashup of the entire film. \n\nIt's an absolute blast, with big guns, big laughs and a whole lotta love. It's the ideal perfect comic book movie minus the captions and exactly the sequel fans will be expecting. Now to write up the first! \n\nRunning Time: 10\nThe Cast: 9\nPerformance: 9\nDirection: 9\nStory: 5 \nScript: 8\nCreativity: 8\nSoundtrack: 10\nJob Description: 10\nThe Extra Bonus Points: 10 for Baby Groot and the epic soundtrack\n\n88% 9/10\n\nwww.spoileralertreviews.co.uk",

            "content": "The Summer movie season tees up Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, the season gets a running start, the kick is up AND...it's...no good! \n\nThe money making Marvel machine is back at it again with their 15th addition to this nine year-old franchise. This time it's a sequel to the 2014 pop culture smash hit, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Director James Gunn returns to the writer and director chair as do many familiar cast members and a handful of new ones. Star-Lord, Gamora, Drax, Rocket Raccoon, and Groot (in fun size) return to save the galaxy once again after their inter-galactic triumphs in the first film. Joining them is Kurt Russell as Ego, Elizabeth Debicki as Ayesha, and Pom Klementieff as Mantis. \n\nThe initial trailer for Vol. 2 had me pretty excited for another Marvel property despite my hesitations towards the first film and the franchise as a whole. As the marketing continued and the release date on the horizon I started getting a really weird feeling about what to expect from this film. In most marketing strategies the film-makers and studio generally give the audience some insight as to what they're aiming for in the film they're making. Not revealing full on spoilers and major plot points and twists but it's main focus as a film. Even though the next Marvel entry Spider-man Homecoming reveals far too much (I feel) in it's most recent trailer, I still have a general idea of what to expect from the narrative. With the Guardians Vol. 2 marketing it felt like Gunn and Marvel were creating a self-indulgent film that just has the antics of the Guardians returning with no real meat to the experience. And well...it was. It was everything I expected it to be and it hurts to say that once again because the same thing happened with Civil War and Doctor Strange. \n\nI've gone on long enough about the events leading up to my viewing experience and it's time to delve into why Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 ultimately falls apart as a film. This movie is fundamentally flawed right from the word,\"GO\"! After three years of waiting for this sequel, the opening minute (post-prologue) had me really pumped to see how far the Guardians have come as a team and see their dynamics flourish in combat, but instead it's exchanged for a \"cute\" sequence instead of an exciting one. This is an immediate off-putting re-introduction to this world because it feels like the whole scene is just for this one character instead of the team that we're here to see. \n\nThe movie establishes right from this moment forward that the Guardians are indeed back and have made their triumphant return to the silver screen, but it's one small character decision early on that's so ABSURDLY forced that really sends the narrative into a tailspin. This sets the tone for the rest of the movie as it ends up feeling like a forced effort from James Gunn. Who frankly, can't write a truly compelling and immersive narrative worth a damn and can't even direct himself out of the obstacles he places in front of himself. \n\nThroughout Vol. 2 there are small glimpses of authentic and natural character moments that I wish we got more of. Instead of focusing on making a more grand, epic, and visual spectacle film, Gunn should have condensed this story down into a far more personal and simple narrative. You can scream and shout that Vol. 2 is personal but it doesn't come across that way because there are a ridiculous amounts of chess pieces at play here. When we look back at a film like Sam Raimi's Spider-man 2 we see a sequel that builds off it's established lead characters and delivers a more condensed and personal story. While Spider-man 2 is a film I would consider a drama before an action film the action and character moments feel earned and more heroic because we see a hero that actually struggles. Spider-man 2 excels because of this and doesn't try to up the spectacle from the first film just because it's a sequel. In Vol. 2 Gunn tries doing this but it's all glossed over and never explored (similar to that of the first film) beyond what we see. Then, when spoilers reveal themselves and the action scenes take place you either saw it coming from a million miles away or it just feels like another forced scenario that includes another forced joke. \n\nGunn tries juggling so much all at once that it makes for a near boring experience overall. The editing is all over the place and instead of really sinking our teeth into a film where we get to see Peter and Ego bond as father and son (the supposed emotional crutch of the film) we are cast off into other areas of the galaxy that really bring the film to a screeching halt. It's like someone who is new to driving a car that starts getting the gist of pressing down on the gas but then presses the brake because they get worried they might cause an accident. Then sitting there as a passenger along on the ride, I finally breathe a sigh of relief when we start heading to our destination, but then they hit the brakes again and it just makes me frustrated to see someone struggle to get somewhere when it shouldn't be that difficult to begin with and it's the fundamentals of driving that they haven't gotten down. THAT is the problem with Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, everything fundamental about crafting a compelling and exciting narrative to reach it's destination with ease isn't present. The narrative just so happens to be the most integral part to an entire film no matter which one it is. It's an uneven, unfocused, mess of a film and it makes everything else I do enjoy about the movie seem entirely pointless to care about. When it tries to pack it's emotional punches it doesn't do anything to me because I've spent so little time with the characters or dynamics they're trying to get me to care about. I don't feel like these moments are earned because they haven't given me a reason to care for them. \n\nWhen I do find myself caring about these characters and this narrative, it's when the film stops worrying about which cool visual to do next or which funny gag to pull out of it's hat. It's in these small moments where I as a viewer realize that the potential is here, and where I realize that despite all their differences these different people who were born and raised in different families and in different lives aren't all that different from each other after all. They all seek acceptance (an undertone that's carried over from the first film), guidance, and someone that truly cares about them. During these times I see what was trying to be accomplished with Vol. 2 but they are so short lived that I don't get my time to lather myself in it. \n\nDespite how frustrating and annoying Vol. 2 is as a feature length film, besides the small moments of sincerity that I love, this film does boast some outstanding features. The production design is to die for and you can really feel the characters living in these scenes surrounded by the gorgeous scenery. Which is then complimented by the rockstar visual effects that really wow me once we reach it's third act. Adding on to it's technical achievements, the sound design and editing mixed in with the visual effects really made for some fairly entertaining sequences. It's also really nice to see a Marvel film not shot in such a painfully boring way like previous incarnations. Here, the cinematographer Henry Braham really utilizes the camera to capture some stunning imagery, character moments, and action sequences. From a technical standpoint, Vol. 2 rocks, but at it's core it does not. \n\nIt's at 15 films in now where I'm battling with myself on deciding where I am as a fan of this franchise and where I see myself with it two years from now. A part of me wants to be there opening night for every one, and I probably will be, but the other part of me wonders if it's even worth continuing with a franchise that seems to be on a heavy decline. Marvel Studios' quality in film-making has fallen off and their best and brightest days are behind them. In my eyes, these movies are produced by a machine, with no real artistic vision or influence over them. No matter what, as long as the reviews stay fairly positive, the movie is at the very least \"fun\" and \"funny\", Marvel will continue to produce products of similar quality until humbled with a film or two that are crucified for not living up to that bold silver title,\"MARVEL STUDIOS\". Much like I said with Doctor Strange,\"I don't want to give up on Marvel, but they are giving me every reason to.\" I am entertained by great films, don't think my string of negative reviews for blockbusters state otherwise, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 just isn't good or entertaining.\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 gets a 42/100",

The plot is stronger, and it's got one of the MCU's best villains to date. The songs are awesome and result in some serious fist-bumping moments (including the opening scene set to Mr. Blue Sky by ELO, and a climactic scene that utilizes The Chain by Fleetwood Mac). The camera is often handled in a loving way, and the film itself is always a visual marvel. I loved Guardians of The Galaxy 2. It's definitely a summer blockbuster.

            "content": "The first GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY was a classic example of capturing lightning in a bottle.  When it was announced, nobody took it seriously or expected all that much from it, but as it turns out, not only did it make a lot of money, it was actually a great movie.  It was the best kind of surprise, because nobody knew what to expect.  GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL. 2 now faces a different challenge.  Not skepticism or disinterest, but expectation.  Most people liked the first movie - a lot - so now the standard has been set, and VOL. 2 has a lot to live up to.\n\nSo how does it fare?  Thankfully, quite well.  It's worth saying right up front that it is not as good as the first film, and it lacks the sort of straightforward narrative of the first, but it's big, bright, exuberant fun.  This is a blockbuster with both humor and heart, and writer/director James Gunn gives us more of the characters we enjoyed the first time around, but also sends them on some interesting (and very human) journeys in this sequel. \n\nThe marketing for the film has given away very few plot points, so I'll mostly stick with those: we find the Guardians of the Galaxy - Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket Racoon (Bradley Cooper), and Baby Groot (Vin Diesel) - on a mission for a group of golden-colored people called The Sovereign, led by their regal ruler Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki).  When Rocket's hijinks cause The Sovereign to violently turn on them, the Guardians are split into groups and sent off on several adventures, reuniting with familiar characters like Yondu (Michael Rooker) and Gamora's psychotic sister, Nebula (Karen Gillan), while also meeting a handful of new faces, including Mantis (Pom Klementieff), an empathetic alien, and Ego (Kurt Russell), an incredibly powerful, nearly godlike force... and Peter's long-lost father. \n\nWhere this movie excels (as in the first film) is in the character department.  James Gunn clearly had storytelling and thematic goals for all of the major players here, and the payoff is a roster of extremely likable and fun people... who also happen to be damaged in some way (generally emotionally or psychologically).  Gunn has said that the first movie was - broadly - about people learning how to love others, while VOL. 2 is about learning how to be loved by others.  That very much comes through in the finished film, and on top of all the wonderful humor and wild action setpieces, we have a truly emotional and surprising human story about accepting yourself and others, flaws and all, and about what family and belonging really mean.  All the Guardians have arcs (some bigger than others, admittedly) that hammer home these themes in different ways, and they're all effective.  More than anything, this movie has an incredibly big, emotional heart, and as silly and cosmically weird as it gets (and boy does it get weird!), there's a fundamentally grounded, human quality at play all the way through.\n\nThe returning Guardians cast all do very good work here (and Baby Groot may be the cutest creation to ever appear in a film), but I'd like to focus in on one of the supporting players and two of the newcomers to this series: Michael Rooker, Pom Klementieff, and Kurt Russell.  Rooker, quite simply, steals the entire film with a gruff, funny, and wounded turn as Yondu, a character played almost entirely for laughs in the first film but who reveals himself to have some legitimately emotional layers to him this time out (he also is the focus of the movie's single best scene, which is a certified showstopper also involving Rocket and Baby Groot).  Klementieff proves to be a delightful addition to the roster, playing her empath character with an intense and eager earnestness that is, frankly, adorable and charming, and her energy compliments her costars quite well (particularly Bautista).  \n\nAnd then we have the man himself, Kurt Russell.  The advertising has treated Russell's character, Ego, very carefully, so I'll honor that by not getting into specifics, but I can say this: Russell is absolutely fantastic in this, playing up an almost goofy, cliched version of his 1980s persona before finally revealing a level of pathos and intensity that is striking.  I wish I could speak freely about his work here, because I really think it's great and worth examining and praising in detail.  I guess that will have to wait!\n\nThe weakest element of the movie is the actual narrative itself.  It has thematic concerns (which are well serviced), but not great plot concerns.  That's not to say there is no narrative, because there certainly is, but there's an extremely laid-back quality to it; we're not propelled forward through the story so much as we're mostly hanging out with the characters in situations.  Literally, a good chunk of the middle of the movie has several of the Guardians just hanging out with Ego, and not doing much more than having character interactions.  These interactions are universally good, don't misunderstand, but there's not really a major driving force in this story until some important revelations are made at the beginning of the third act.   The movie is structured in a radically different way from the first, as the bulk of the film has the Guardians team split up into separate plotlines (which do eventually converge); some will find this compounds the easy-going narrative, but a case could be made it gives the movie a greater variety of sequences to play with. \n\nA huge component of these movies is the music, and the songs are again wonderfully implemented here, delivering even more of an emotional impact at key moments than ever before.  The score by Tyler Bates is also strong, as are all of the technical categories, particularly sound design and visual effects; Baby Groot and Rocket have such incredible expressiveness that you totally buy them as real characters. \n\nIn the final analysis, I had a great time with GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL. 2, and I suspect most fans of the first will find a ton to enjoy.  Nothing can recapture the shockingly good surprise of the previous movie, but VOL. 2 expands on the characters, lets them grow a bit, and let's us as an audience spend some time with these terrifically fun people.  I call that a big win.",

            "content": "If there's one thing you can always count on with Marvel Studios, it's the humor.  That is, that there will always be tons of it, in whichever project, and however serious they are, there will always be plenty of humor.  With some films that doesn't work out so well (I'm looking at you Doctor Strange).  With other films it fits in nicely, like Guardians of the Galaxy.  It's that humor above all else that keeps Volume 2 afloat.\n\nHowever, even a series as funny as Guardians can have its bumps and bruises, that includes some mistimed jokes.  But I think what hurt this sequel was the uneven pacing.  Volume 2 took the Empire Strikes Back approach by spacing out the team for most of the film.  This approach proved to be both good and bad for the film.  On one hand, it gives us fresh dynamics like with Rocket, (Baby) Groot & Yondu.  Or Drax & Mantis.  Or Gamora & Peter/Gamora & Nebula.  It all plays out as nice character depth for all of them as the group dives deeper into the (Fast and Furious style) fact that they are all the only family each other has.  \n\nWith that said, spreading out the characters really slows down the pacing.  In fact, you don't even really know what the films actually leading to until there's only 25 or 30 minutes left in the movie.  Basically, we meet Ego the Living Planet, played by Kurt Russel, who is also Peter Quill's father.  Surprise surprise, Ego turns out to be hiding a whole lot more than expected and Peter and the Guardians are forced to take him down.  But this all doesn't happen until very late in the game.  So much so that the third act feels so incredibly unbalanced since the first hour of the movie doesn't seem to be leading towards this at all.\n\nLuckily, there's a lot about Volume 2 that I was thrilled about.  First and foremost, this is the best looking Marvel film to date, without a doubt, bar none.  It's the first film to be shot with an 8k resolution camera, called the Red Weapon 8k.  Every single shot in this film is oozing with gorgeousness, which is one of the reasons I would like to see the film again.  Being that it's one of the few Marvel space opera's, it probably has the most difficult time looking as good as it does.  Everything in the background and foreground is fake.  Heck, even Groot and Rocket are fake.  But you wouldn't know it by looking at it.  Perhaps they built some sets, but they couldn't possibly build everything, and it all looks so dang real.\n\nAlso, as I previously mentioned, the humor is on point 90 percent of the time.  This is probably where James Gunn's brilliance comes in the most, his ability to perfectly time the humor in with the action.  It's also pleasing that it's not only spoken humor, there's plenty of physical humor as well.  Drax particularly stands out in this regard, as does Mantis, Rocket, and of course Baby Groot.  I can complain over and over about some of the pacing issues and how the overall dramatic beats of the film didn't necessarily work for me, but the film is a blast from beginning to end, there's no denying that.  But I think it needed a little bit more balance between the drama and comedy if it wanted to pull off some of the third act feats that it tried to, and I think this film could have used a little bit more time with the team together rather than separate.\n\nA few last-minute tidbits to comment on:  I could care less about Nebula and Gamora's relationship.  There's something about it that just doesn't resonate with me.  I have to believe Sylvester Stallone's role will expand in Vol.3 because he got absolutely nothing to do.  And lastly, the 5 post credit scenes were probably unnecessary, especially if none of them tied into Infinity War.\n\n+The best-looking Marvel film to date\n\n+I love Drax\n\n+They didn't exploit Baby Groot as much as I expected\n\n+Plenty of great humor\n\n-But the dramatic moments don't always hit\n\n-Serious pacing issues\n\n-Spreading the team out hurt the film\n\n7.6/10",

No convoluted plot, the story didn't jump from location to location to location, managed to stay grounded. I enjoyed this more than Doctor Strange and I legitimately didn't expect that. All Drax did was make jokes and quips 95% of the film, other than the one heart-felt moment. That's the one thing I hate about these films, they turn Drax into a punchline, instead of the powerful being he is. I liked this one, hell, I LOVED it more than the first.

With many remaining cast and crew joining forces with the new additions, this is one movie that almost surpasses the original content.\n\nUpon being summoned by the Sovereign Planet to defeat a being that can warp through space and time, the Guardians find themselves on the run because of Rocket's fast hands. Shortly after, they have a run-in with the man we have all been waiting to meet: Peter Quill's father, only this time, his father is a different figure than the comics.\n\nThe MCU chose the brilliant path of connection to Ego, the Living Planet. Rather than the comics, the MCU decided to go with a character who implies a far greater power within Quill and the events of the universe, itself.\n\nQuill, Gamora, and Drax are transported to his realm, while Rocket and Baby Groot (arguably the reason most are seeing this movie) stay behind to work on repairs to the ship. \n\nPeter finally received the answers he has been so desperately searching for. However, the question remains: what does this mean for Quill and the Guardians, and how will this affect the story of the MCU?

I knew it would be hard to top the first movie. That movie was so different from other Superhero movies that we were accustomed to, it was like a breath of fresh air. I knew lightning couldn't strike twice so I kept my expectations in check, but I never though it was gonna be this bad. \nI've read some reviews and I can't help but think that critics keep giving Marvel Studios a pass simply because of their track record. The most frequent complaint I've read was that volume 2 is just more of the same, but still enjoyable. More of the same of what? Definitely not funny jokes. Oh it did have a lot of jokes, probably a little too much, but most of em fell flat. It was as if they decided to keep spewing jokes hoping that audiences would find some of em funny. And there's definitely a lot less action scenes in this movie. What we have are more scenes of characters interacting, to show some sort of \"character development\" I guess. it would have helped if those scenes helped move the plot forward, but they didn't. It's just scene upon scene wherein characters talk and bicker, and those scenes amount to nothing. For the longest time in the middle third there's no clear direction. You wouldn't know if the plot was actually heading somewhere. True, Marvel movies are starting to look the same and generic, and that's the reason why some people are starting to find these movies boring. The boredom you'll get from this movie is not of that type. I have never seen a Marvel movie where a lot of people in the audience kept yawning (at least in my row). What makes this so unbelievable is that this is a sequel to The Guardians of the Galaxy! Even the soundtrack, which felt natural and integral in the first movie felt like an afterthought here. In some scenes the music felt as shoehorned as it was in Suicide Squad. I dunno where James Gunn got it wrong. This isn't playing it safe because we are not getting the exact same things from the first movie. If we got the exact same movie, there would be lots of funny jokes, tons of witty banter, and a lot of kick ass action sequences- and that would have been fun! This is definitely a Marvel misfire. Anyone who says otherwise has been drinking way too much Marvel Kool-Aid to think objectively.",

Off the bat it's fair to say Vol. 2 is a bit of a step down from it's predecessor especially considering the original Guardians element of surprise. That's not to say the film isn't entertaining, those elements alone have been the most consistent this film has to offer. What I love about these films alone are their detachment from the other films on the MCU earth, their ability to explore intergalactic outlandish space scenery and the characters for the actual most part played by such an awesome ensemble they make these pack of misfits work. The film is mainly about origins and their famly conections in opposed to their own which may feel more meaningful. The film's primary flaw comes down to the plot not being as interesting as the original film, especially with some of the characters roles. Nonethless, seeing these characters and the world on the big screen again is a well welcome return as the film is genuinely hilarious nailing all their jokes. I also loved the Stan Lee cameo almost confirming a fan theory about his appearances in all Marvel films. If you loved the first film, chances are you'll love this one too even if it isn't as the best or worst the MCU has currently delivered. Recommended, as adequate and essential to say for the least.

            "content": "If Marvel was ever going to have a dud in its near historic run of blockbuster success, it should have been Guardians of the Galaxy, a movie that asked audience to care about a talking raccoon and a tree creature who could only say three words. And yet that movie had me in tears by the end, and I was not alone. Writer/director James Gunn (Slither, Super) graduated from Troma to demented indie films to the Big Time with studio tentpoles. A sequel was fast-tracked and is definitely one of the most highly anticipated films of 2017 not named Star Wars. Can Gunn still deliver fans what they want without falling into the morass that is fan service, a sticky trap that can sap big-budget sequels of differentiation and make them feel more like product?\n\nSet mere months after the events of the first film, the Guardians are enjoying their newfound celebrity and taking lucrative for-hire jobs. Star-Lord a.k.a. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) and Gamora (Zoe Saldana) are still going through their will-they-won't-they sexual tension. Gamora's sister Nebula (Karen Gillan) is still looking to gain the upper hand. Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) is growing up and still cute. Drax (Dave Bautista) is still mourning his family and trying to better fit in. And Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) is still making rebellious, self-destructive decisions, like stealing valuables from The Sovereign, a race of genetically bred golden snobs. The leader of the Sovereign, Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki, looking good in gold), declares a bounty on the Guardians for their disrespect. The Ravagers are hired to collect the Guardians, though Captain Yondu (Michael Rooker) is hesitant to go after his surrogate son, Peter. Complicating matters further is the arrival of Ego (Kurt Russell), a mystifying man who happens to also be a living planet and Peter's biological father.\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy vol. 2 is highly enjoyable with great moments, great action, and great characters but I was left feeling like it was a step or two behind the original and I've been trying to articulate just why that is. I thought perhaps it was better to be upfront. I think it all stems from the fact that it's not as fresh the second time, it doesn't quite have the same blast of attitude and personality to disarm and take you by surprise, and I'll admit part of this is just due to the fact that it's a sequel to a hugely popular movie. However, also because of this there are now a set of expectations that Gunn is leaning towards because audiences now have acute demands.\n\nWe have an idea of what a Guardians of the Galaxy movie can provide, and from those demands spur creative decisions that don't fully feel as integrated this go-round as they did in the first film. It feels like Gunn is trying to also work within a box he's created for himself, and for the most part he succeeds admirably, but it still feels slightly lesser. The standout musical moment occurs during an opening credits that involve an action sequence from a Baby Groot-eyed point of view. As the Guardians are flying and falling to destroy a ferocious alien blob in the background, Groot is strutting and dancing to \"Mr. Blue Sky\" by ELO. It's a moment of unrestrained pleasure and it also undercuts action movie conventions by having a majority of the events obscured or implied. It's the moment that feels the most like that electric feeling of discovery from the first film. There are also 80s pop-culture references and cameos and some off-kilter comedy again. Much of it is fun, especially one cameo in particular as it relates to Peter's father, but they also have the noticeable feel of boxes to be checked, expected items that now must be incorporated in what a Guardians of the Galaxy feature should be. Expectations can lead to fan service and then that leads to less chances and originality. Hey, I loved the 2014 original and consider it my favorite Marvel movie so I don't want them to simply chuck out everything that worked just for something one hundred percent different. You want what you loved but you don't want it exactly the same, which is the creative bind. Gunn leans into what the audience wants and I can't fault him too hard. It's still a really good film.\n\nWhat Guardians vol. 2 does best is remind you why you love these characters. It even elevates a group of supporting players from the first movie into characters you genuinely care about, chiefly Nebula and Yondu. Both of these characters were slightly defanged antagonists in the first film, problems but problems you didn't want to see go away. Yondu gets the biggest boost thanks to the thematic bridge of Peter's search for his father. The notorious leader of the Ravagers has a definite soft spot for the scrappy human and it's finally come to a head with his tempestuous crew. They mutiny on Yondu and declare him to be an unfit leader, unable to do what is necessary. This direction allows for a lot of introspection for a character that was essentially just Michael Rooker in blue paint. He has a history to him and he makes a moral deviation from his expected path, one that bears ongoing consequences. He's Peter's real surrogate father, and his acceptance of this reality brings a snarling secondary antagonist into the realm of a full-blown character that earns our empathy (a Mary Poppins joke also had me in stitches).\n\nThe same can be said for Nebula, who is working out some serious daddy issues. She is the stepsister to Gamora and holds quite a grudge against her green sibling. It seems that their father, Thanos, would constantly pit them against one another, and Nebula would always lose, and with each loss came a painful consequence. It's the kind of back-story that's given more time to breathe and develop. It opens up an antagonist into another person who is dealing with trauma and pain and who doesn't play well with others, which seems as good a job description to join the Guardians as anything. Nebula has a fearsome sense of competition with her sister, and that parlays into some fun over-the-top action sequences. When the movie allows the two women to talk, as surviving sisters of rather than enemies, is where Nebula comes into her own.\n\nGunn makes sure there's a grounded and emotional core to his characters, which makes these appealing underdogs and antiheroes ever easier to root for. Guardians vol. 2 doesn't really move the overall plot forward too much but it does explore the relationships and their personal lives with greater depth and clarity. The characters are spread out into smaller pairings for a majority of the extended second act, which allows interesting connections and developments due to the personalities. Drax is paired with Ego's assistant/pet Mantis (Pom Klementieff) and it's an instantly winning couple, a man who only speaks literally and a woman who is able to channel the feelings of strangers through touch. They're both relied upon for the greatest amount of comic relief and they routinely deliver. Klementieff (Old Boy) is a wide-eyed delight. Rocket and Yondu being stuck together allows for both to come to realizations that feel organic though also too fated by Gunn's hand. Their general disregard for decorum leads to some great action sequences. Gamora and Nebula are working through their family issues and it makes both more interesting. When they come to a form of resolution it still feels awkward but earnest and right. But the biggest personal exploration is Peter and his own lingering space daddy issues.\n\nAnother fantastic addition to the movie was the character of Ego because of the wonderfully charming Russell (The Hateful Eight) and also because of what the character allows for. The very fact that Ego is a millions-year-old living planet is a clever curveball for the Peter Quill \"who's your daddy?\" mystery sweepstakes. It also opens all sorts of intriguing questions that the second act wades through, like the exact mechanics of how Ego exists, projects a Russell-looking avatar, and what is his ultimate purpose. I'm going to steer away from spoilers but fans of the comic will already have suspicions where this whole father/son reconciliation may lead, and you won't be disappointed. Russell radiates paternal warmth and it goes a ways to cover up the purposeful obfuscation of the character. Because Gunn has to hold back on certain revelations, some of them gasp-worthy, he can't open up the father/son dynamic too fast or too unambiguous. As a result, the latent bonding relies upon more familiar touchstones, like throwing the ball out back with your pops or sharing a love of music. Russell makes even the most ridiculous thing sound reasonable, which is important considering we're talking about a planet boning ladies.\n\nGunn also takes several steps forward as a visual filmmaker with the sequel. He has a great feel for visual comedy and how to undercut the more boilerplate heroic moments in other superhero fair. He fills his screen with crazy, bight, psychedelic colors and has a Tarantino-esque instinct for marrying film with the right song. The sequel doesn't have as many iconic moments set to music but it will play most agreeably. The special effects are pretty terrific all around but I appreciate that Gunn doesn't allow the movie to feel overwhelmed by them, which is important considering there are fundamentally CGI-only characters. Gunn's action sequences, chases, escapes, and breakouts are presented with plenty of dazzling style and witty attitude to spare without feeling obnoxious. The comedy is consistently funny and diverting. There's a bit with the need for tape that just keeps going and actually becomes funnier the longer it goes, undercutting the end-of-the-universe stakes with the search for something as mundane as tape. My screening was presented in 3D and I was worried about the film being set in space and being too dark. This is not the case at all, and while the 3D isn't a high selling point like it was for Doctor Strange, it is a nice experience that doesn't dilute Gunn's gonzo color scheme. The level of thought put into his novelties can be staggering, like an end credits series of dancing clips that also manages to play upon a character note for Drax. Gunn manages to further comment on characterization even during the freaking end credits. The final showdown goes on a bit longer than necessary and is the only section of the movie that feels consumed by CGI spectacle, but the fact that only the end feels this way can be considered another small triumph of Gunn fighting through a corporate system.\n\nMarvel knows what it's doing to a molecular level. Almost ten years into their system, they know what works in their criss-crossing franchises and how to calibrate them for maximum audience satisfaction. At this point after Guardians, Ant-Man, and Doctor Strange, they've more than earned the benefit of the doubt no matter the premise. However, entrenched success has a way of calcifying audience expectations. Guardians of the Galaxy was so funky, so different, so anarchic, and so wildly enjoyable. It should only be expected that the things that made it different would now be folded into audience expectations. The misfits can only be misfits for so long. It may not be as brash and fun or memorable as the first edition but it does benefit from the strong rapport of its cast and the deeper characterization, tackling some serious subjects while still slow motion stepping to a murder montage set to the golden oldies of the 1970s. The movie matters not because of the action, or the funny one-liners, or the adorableness of Baby Groot. It's because we genuinely love these oddball characters. The first one introduced them and brought them together, and the second film deepens their bonds and widens their scope of family. Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2 is a sequel that provides just about everything that fans should want. If it feels slightly lesser it's probably just because it can't be fresh twice, but Guardians vol. 2 still dances to its own beat and it's still a beautiful thing.\n\nNate's Grade: B+",

The primary reason this film is enjoyable is because the characters are expanded upon and you are given more reasons to care about them with them still being hilarious be it thanks to the solid script and the chemistry they clearly have between one another so the emotional core still exists and the humour is just as good as before. The action though solid, entertaining and having plenty of visual style doesn't entirely work towards the end but most of it is good. The soundtrack (which was incredible in the first film) is just about as good as before and is used really well. The score is once again really good and it looks fantastic. The plot however is a little bit obvious in parts and one of the villains really does seem quite forced. Despite its flaws though I had a great time with this film and I look forward to see more from the Guardians of the Galaxy.",

James Gunn's Volume 2 sequel is creative, fun, wacky, action-packed, and extremely entertaining.   \n\nBecause it's Volume 2, there are 2 times the action, 2 times the explosions, 2 times the gags and laughs.\n\nAs Groot says, \"Welcome to the frickin Guardians Of The Galaxy!\" (Although he didn't use the word \"frickin\".)\n\nUplifting theme: \n\"There are 2 kinds of beings in the universe: those who dance and those who do not.\" - Drax (Dave Bautista)\n\"I wanted more.  I desired meaning.\" - Ego (Kurt Russell)\nYou need to dance more.\nFamily isn't always just what you are born into.\nFriendship, sacrifice\n\"Sometimes the thing that you're searching for your whole life is right there by your side all along and you don't even know it.\" - Peter Quill/Star-lord (Chris Pratt) \n\nThings I liked:\nThe opening credits alone were awesome and hilarious.  That's what I'm talking about!  What a way to start the ride.\nGroot!  Oh my gosh, he's soooooo awesome!\nChris Pratt sure has come a long way since his flubby days on Parks and Recreation: The Complete Series.   Female fans even get to enjoy his new six-pack abs when he takes his shirt off.\nKurt Russell!  Nice job on the scenes in the opening of the movie when he was younger.\nHarpulary Batteries.  Ha ha  We learn so much more about Rocket and his motivations in this one.\nSylvester Stallone! \nThe music soundtrack Guardians of the Galaxy: Awesome Mix Vol. 1 (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) is a lot of fun and plays an important role in the story, like in the first flick.\nAs expected, a lot of slow motion shots.  Hilarious.  Epic.\nTalk about a sister feud.  Jeez.\nI love that Marvel always puts Stan Lee in their movies.  He actually shows up twice this time in Volume 2.\nReally great special effects.\nThe talented cast includes Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, Michael Rooker, and Kurt Russell.\nTaserface.  Ha ha\nThere was actually a lot of character development and backstory information about our heroes and even some of the villains.  It really adds depth to the movie and care even more.\nIn the last movie, Kevin Bacon got some funny shout-outs.  This time it's David Hasselhoff.  Ha ha\nZune.  300 songs.  Ha ha\nKeep watching after the credits start to roll at the end and stay seated until the very, very end.  There are quite a few scenes to watch.\n\n \n\nThings I didn't like:\nA lot of inappropriate jokes.\nSome of the lines and scenes in the trailer are different from the actual movie.  That always bugs me.\n To truly appreciate it, you need to have seen the first Guardians Of The Galaxy.\nThe \"gold\" people look cool, but I didn't quite get into what they were all about.\nAs much as I enjoyed it, it's still not as good or fresh as the original.  Sequels rarely are, right?\n\nInteresting lines:\n\"All you do is yell at each other.  You're not friends.\" - Nebula (Karen Gillan)\n\"You're right.  We're family.\" - Drax\n\"When you're ugly and someone loves you, you know they love you for who you are.  Beautiful people never know who they can trust.\" - Drax \n\nFunny lines:\n\"So, we're really saving the galaxy again?\" - Rocket (Bradley Cooper)\n\"I guess!\" - Peter Quill/Star-Lord\n\"Awesome!

Despite that and the predictable formula, this sequel is highly entertaining that's so humourous even with sex jokes, I'd label it as a comedy more than a superhero flick. I totally enjoyed the film and laughed for most parts of the film. The backstories of the main characters are also very well clarified, giving us more reasons to care about them.",

For example, when ego stupidly tells peter that he killed her mother, you can see peter screaming, but the expression, the scream, its just don't feel realistic. I almost thought that he was an amateur stuntman or something like that. Another thing, some people considers this movie is the most mature film MCU made (some review said that) but it's not. Only because you have some sexual jokes doesn't mean that it's mature. It's just darkly funny for adults that can understand it, kids wouldn't understand it.

Obviously emboldened by unexpected box office gold, director James Gunn decided to ramp up the volume to an '11' for this sequel.\n\n(Spoilers!) Aiming for a grandiose villain this time, Ego the Living Planet, as played by Kurt Russell is a toothless tiger. We are treated yet again to another end-of-the-world or better yet, end-of- the-universe scenario complete with sub-par special effects that threatens a total of three planets in the whole universe (I counted three, and that includes Missouri, USA, representing Earth). With Dr Strange anticlimactic ending alongside this anticlimactic last third act, one wonders if Marvel Studios is cutting corners when it comes to effects.\n\nThis time round infantile jokes revolving round adolescent concept of fornication are abound. They are only worth a chuckle once and repetitive reiterations only serve to reveal Gunn's sense of humour. Since he's contract-bound by Disney's kid-friendly ratings, most of the jokes fell flat. To put it bluntly, if you want to tell sex jokes, go all the way like the American Pie movies. \n\nAs other review sites have noted, the first act is the most energetic, providing a shot in the arm only for the first 15 minutes. The second act which lasts around an hour drags as there are only two settings: Yondu's Ravager's ship and Ego's planet. One couldn't care less about Chris Pratt's absentee Dad's hangups. Spielberg does it better than Gunn in his earlier movies. It was so dull that I actually dozed off more than a couple of times.\n\nThe preposterous third act recalls Batman Vs Superman's \"Martha\" resolution to the said conflict. But since everyone who fervently follows MCU's episodic TV serial-like movies have a short memory span, they would probably forgive James Gunn for being such a genius when he uses basically the same plot device to snap Peter Quill out of his hypnosis. Superheroes do have a soft spot for their mothers...\n\nThe Ego/Peter Quill fight scene recalls the now dated and badly- rendered fight scene between Neo and Agent Smith in Matrix Revolutions. I groaned at the Pac-Man transformation scene. I know many people like the 70s/80s pop cultural references but this scene is bordering on being ridiculous. If one wants a nostalgic trip down memory lane, 'Boogie Nights' offers a more superior experience. Then again, the target audience for this film would not be old enough to view that fine film.\n\nTaken in totality, this film is more banal than \"Civil War\", many of the jokes were unfunny and falls flat. The whole film is filled with so much colour palettes, it hurts the eyes. To summarise bluntly, watching this film is akin to binging on fizzy drinks to a whole new diabetic level.",

And for this reason Marvel makes tons of $$$ without any quality improvement or originality, because as drones, we all just gobble it up. It's like we have been given a command: \"This year you will see the following movies and not hold them to any standard, kapeesh!!\" \n\nMarvel movie story lines have been declining while at the same time special effects and better actors getting hired has been increasing. Like how winning an Oscar now lands you a role in a super hero/big budget production rather than another artistic role: Brie Larson in Captain Marvel (and the horrible Kong), Lupita Nyong'o in Star Wars (ok, that's not Marvel, but still a huge franchise.), Jared Leto as the Joker (DC, I know), but you get the picture. This creates a conundrum in our heads: good acting, great special effects, bad story writing, so, hmmmm.......does this mean that I liked it? Should I go with the flow and say I liked it, because critics aren't gonna diss a movie that's sure to make $$$ and I don't wanna seem like a killjoy or shame myself in front of my firends? You know, I'll see the next Marvel movie and then decide.\n\nAnd so this year, the cycle begins with us giving our money to Guardians of the Galaxy V2. Expect nothing more than what the trailer has to offer. Or see the first one again and it'll be the same as seeing V2, you'll just save money. The story does advance with Kurt Russell starring as Starlord's dad. Kind of a rehash of \"No/Luke....I am your father.\" It's good when they hire good actors. Make-up and special effects are great. But in all, I wouldn't use the words \"enjoyable\" or \"exciting.\" I'll just say, \"Ritual completed, onto the next superhero movie.\"\n\nHey I'm a victim here nonetheless. I'm not criticizing people for seeing Guardians, as I also did, but I'm getting to get critical of us who every year, dish out our money for these superhero movies, which are in fact not becoming any better in quality, and studio execs thinking that they are creating masterpieces because of the gross $$$, hence thereforth making no extra effort to make a better movie. \n\nSo see it, or stay at home and stare at the wall...it's up to you. If ya got nothing better to do then what else should ya do??\n\nI'd just like to rename this movie: Guardians of Ga'ahoole: The Owls of the Galxay.",

He's just hanging out.\n\nWithin the first 30 seconds of the movie, it became painful to watch. The lackluster banter between characters reminded me of a bad Seinfeld episode.

All I know for sure is that I was completely disappointed, especially because I loved the fist Guardians so much.\n\nThis is just cashing in, and the writing is absolute trash. There is no way this movie will maintain a score over 6.0 in the long run. If you were extremely eager to see it like I was, change that frame of mind and forget this movie.

I know I will receive a multitude of unhelpful votes for voicing my honest feedback about this movie. However, I hope that my feedback will be helpful for people who are able to judge a film in an objective manner so that they, at least, will be able to save their hard earned cash.\n\nFirstly, the main antagonist is a Marvel character that has been completely changed for this movie. It bears no background similarity to the character in the comics whatsoever. I understand that the Marvel movies are all about making a spin on the comic book story arcs, but this difference was far too large for me to accept.\n\nWhilst watching the movie, I had to ponder whether I had stepped into a Marvel Superhero version of \"Fast and Furious\". There was a continuous message that family is important and how the protagonists became who they were due to disenfranchised childhoods. Whilst this is a valid point, I do not feel that it belongs in a superhero action movie as it serves no purpose. Worse was when the message contradicted itself when we see Peter Quill betrayed by his Father. The clumsiness of this contradiction did nothing to alleviate the sickly sweet message that the movie was trying to convey. I get that James Gunn is trying to send out a message to the younger generation but I would think that kids go to watch a superhero movie for the action, and will not really appreciate or acknowledge the message that he is driving.\n\nUnlike the first movie, there was a distinct lack of character focus and their abilities. It could easily have been an action movie without superheroes. In fact, the movie seemed to be focused on two characters when it came to showcasing their abilities. One of these had a sequence that was inspired by the Quicksilver scenes in the X-Men movies. The other was extremely underwhelming and was defeated far too incredibly when you consider the differences in age and experiences. None of the characters were interesting with the exception of Nebula and Mantis. However, Pom Klementieff played her role like a stuttering female cyborg that I even thought the role was played by an East Asian actress before I checked the cast members. The actors paid to play the new characters were miscast in my opinion. Sylvester Stallone's performance reminded me of his Judge Dredd and not in a good way.\n\nIt was clear that the popular factors in the first movie were taken and overdone in the second movie. Drax was made to look like a dumb fool once again but even more than in the first movie. While the CGI effects were good, the cuteness factor of Baby Groot served only to market the movie to kids and geek girls, and to rake in merchandise profit. There was also constant mention and focus on the cassette mix which was totally unnecessary (again, for merchandise promotion).\n\nWith the exception of Captain America and the first two Avengers and Thor movies, why do the Marvel movies have to be over-saturated with humor? It's one thing to market the movies to a wider audience but it's totally another thing when it's taken too far, and the humor becomes so clich\u00e9d.",

            "content": "The first Guardians film seemed to take audiences by surprise. It felt fresh and different and meeting the crew of eccentric characters for the first time was all part of the fun, and it utilized the element of surprise to kind of brand its unique (in the Marvel universe anyways) sense of humor and chemistry. \n\nVol. 2 recognizes the general adoration of Voi. 1, and sets out to give us more of the same, just on a bigger scale. So, whether or not this works for you will likely depend on your expectations. It loses a bit of its edge, but it gains in terms of developing a much larger mythology (and the end credits suggest it will get bigger yet). \n\nI read an interview with Gunn where he discussed his desire to really exercise some creative freedom when it came to Vol. 2, and in many ways he sees it as a built in universe with no real rules. The opening sequence stands as a good example of the kind of things we can expect as the film moves forward, taking a larger than life galactic battle between the Guardians and a space monster and narrowing our perspective onto a prolonged... and almost awkwardly prolonged scene of Baby Groot randomly dancing through the chaos. The scene is genuinely funny, and what is rather brilliant about the way Gunn approaches it, and subsequent scenes that play out in a similar way, is that he never cues us on when the laughter should start or stop. He just lets these moments linger, and the generating effect, at least in my case, was a theater experience where the laughing never really stopped through the entire film. \n\nThat is not to say that the film allows the humor to get in the way of the story. There is a definite emotional heart woven into Vol. 2, one that is ever more deliberate and poignant than Vol. 1.. And, for me anyways, the emotion definitely landed in a very real way. What's interesting to consider is the overlap in actors and themes with Fate and the Furious, and what Vol. 2 really celebrates is the idea that family does not need to be defined by blood or divisions, and the theme of family and fatherhood permeates the entire thing in a neat way, beginning with the reveal of who Quill's father is. \n\nSomething else to note in Vol. 2 is the way it takes the collective group of Vol. 1 and splits them up into different partnerships for the majority of the film. This means that the collaborative chemistry in the first film is given some different opportunities to develop into smaller more intimate relationships in the second. So while the overall pacing ends up a bit more erratic and undisciplined (the story in Vol. 1 was much tighter), the moments between characters, moments that don't feel obliged to rush or move anywhere, in particular, do gain a greater authenticity. For example, we really get a chance to appreciate the voice work by Cooper, along with the striking animation that helps to bring life to the fur and facial futures. It is quite astounding. And we are also given some unexpected dynamics, such as the shared revelation between Rocket and Yondu about their family past. \n\nSo, if you feel inclined to ask (and I think it is a natural question to ask), is the second film better than the first? The same? Not as good? I would say it is all a matter of perspective. That sounds a little too obvious an answer, and a bit of a cop-out. But I think it is very true when it comes to Vol. 2.. You might end up feeling the loss of the surprise of the first film, and if you did, I think that would make sense. You might love the sprawling world and larger mythology that Vol. 2 opens up, and if you do, that makes a whole lot of sense. You might get frustrated with scenes like the extended opening sequence because they feel a bit ecelectic and undisciplined, especially when set up against the rest of the Marvel universe (which get surprsingly little attention here in Vol. 2). Or you might love the freedom that this represents. You might miss the group playing off one another in Vol. 1, or you might love the more intimate relationships that Vol. 2 builds. \n\nHowever you come at this film, I am fairly certain that most viewers will end up having a really good time with it. I know my theater never stopped laughing through the entire thing, and that says a lot. It film is uber violent on the surface, but sentimental and heartfelt underneath. it takes a sort of self-aware approach to the over-the-top space opera, but it also knows how to inject it all with something that feels very relatable and down to earth. It is full of humor, but it also wants to give us some touching moments that will stick with us. And while it doesn't do all of this perfectly, I think it does it all admirably. Well worth a viewing if you ask me.",

            "content": "Writer/ Director James Gunn's \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" from 2014 (wow, that was fast) is not only the best entry in Marvel's box office-busting Cinematic Universe in my opinion; it's one of my favorite films of this decade full stop. Gunn's hand-made aesthetic and an ever-present love for his characters and source material (along with stunning technical merits, gorgeous effects and color palette, game cast, and perfect comedic timing) cemented \"Guardians\" as the pleasant surprise of the year and a bonafide critical smash. Expectations were justifiably sky high for a follow up, then in steps \"Vol.2.\" \n\nLuckily Gunn and co. stick the landing with only some leg wobble. Yeah, much of the surprise is gone. We know these characters and we know the quirks. But the characters are still fun to be around and the quirks a joy to roll with in an MCU of near endless iterations and routines. Most satisfying, the ensemble of outcasts (our heroes) have evolved from the last outing. Rocket isn't just comedic relief. Baby Groot isn't overused. Drax is as giddy as a hyena. If Starlord isn't as charming or charismatic as the last time it's because his relationship with his father, Ego (Kurt Russell), is the dramatic center of the show. Gamora is underutilized but her subplot with her sister Nebula hit home. Most surprising is Yondu (Michael Rooker); who is given so much depth and emotional gravitas that he emerges as the most memorable aspect of the film... and maybe even the single best thing about this installment. \n\nUnlike it's predecessor, \"Vol.2\" is a comedy first, and a space opera second. This is a bit of a problem, especially in the first act. Vol.1 used humor to spice up a believable sci-fi world and awesome characters. Here, it feels forced: notably in a first half hour that's part franchise reintroduction and part stand-up routine. The comedy does become less scattershot however, as does it's relatively lose (and sometimes distractedly unfocused) plot, the further into the running time we get. Equally unfocused is the development of Ego, Peter Quill's father, who is seminal to the plot. I always love Kurt Russell, and he's as solid as ever here. I just wish so much of his role didn't involve lengthy exposition. \n\nBut like \"Vol.1,\" Guardians 2 is a brilliant piece of visual film making. The colors pop, the action's exciting, and Gunn infuses all of this with his now signature handmade, fanboy energy. There are also moments of pure joy and heart that rival (if not surpass) the best bits of the first film. The final half hour or so is pure bliss. We are still firmly in the upper echelon of summer blockbusters with this one.\n\nMany were expecting perfection with this one... expectations that could possibly be never met. But \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2\" delivers a brash, funny, action-packed delight that's hard to knock. It's heart is in the right place. It's characters? More than welcome for the inevitable \"Round 3.\"",

The constant theorising with the fact if Peter and Gamora will finally admit there feelings.\n\nMinor characters from the predecessor have a more dominant role in the sequel such a Nebula or Yondu. Humour is sarcastic and loud in your face funny.\n\nDespite its flaws in humour and story telling, the visuals are stunning throughout. The CGI down to Rocket's hair was fantastic.\n\nA fantastic film for teenagers and adults alike. Although the set backs, there isn't enough to dismiss this movie. Anyway James Gunn said that he didn't want the sequel to be a copy of Guardians of the Galaxy. In that respect, he succeeded. Soundtrack just as the original is fantastic, classic 80s music throughout.\n\nAnd Baby Groot. Sold.\n\nSo join the Guardians of the Galaxy for another MARVEL breath of fresh air.

            "content": "Gaurdians 2 might well amount to Marvels biggest, weirdest movie to date, it's not quite as new and effortless as the first movie, indeed it forces those elements that made the original so wonderfully unusual, the Cool soundtrack, irreverent humour, and anarchic attitude feel less natural, like the film is struggling for that same vibe, trying a bit too hard to uncork that bottle of lightening. It can too be said that the film sadly falls victim to a number of the narrative and aesthetic crimes of the modern blockbuster, namely the plot is a little unfocused and a bit too freewheeling (though not crowded feeling, bludgeoning and overindulged, and thats an important distinction because thats what makes these big films feel fucking exhausting to watch these days) and the other misstep, a thing that happens more and more now is where the last half hour of these films descends into computer generated chaos, where all sense, weight and meaning disappears amid an insane maelstrom of pixelated nonsense that doesn't feel tethered to anything, it feels like these movies are almost obliged to become a big \"lets all race to stop the big thing that destroys stuff\" type ending. That sadly is the case here, the longer the film goes on the more over the top everthing becomes and the more you want it to just calm the fuck down and stop trying to appeal to the ADD kids in the audience who simply love all the bright, swirling colours. But im being a little bit of a dick here, because Gaurdians 2 is a joy, it's not quite the first movie but if anything is even bigger and crazier and more outlandish. The science fiction is more rich and imaginative, and there are truly awe inspiringly odd and beautiful things to behold (Egos planet is a wonder, like a 70's album cover come to life)  director James Gunn clearly being given licence to go full on mushroom fulled drug trippiness with his crazy on screen universe, and theres even a looser more ragged feel to it, especially when it settles down to simply give us time with these terrific bunch of dysfunctional tearaways (Drax is the movie stealer once again, but dialled up a notch, Dave Bautista is truly hilarious) the real attention grabber here is the legendary Kurt Russell, gloriously channelling his 80's persona into living planet Ego, he is a total joy, every bit the Kurt of Big Trouble In Little China or Escape From New York, that wonderful glint always in his steely blue eyes, he appears as youthful and vital as he ever has here and it's a true pleasure to see the beloved cult superstar just swagger around, owning the joint, that Jack Burton cheekiness radiating off him (yes im clearly in love with the man, deal). Notable too is just how damn adorable Baby Groot is, he's the source of many laughs and some off the most standout moments (including an opening set to Mr Blue Sky by ELO, that nearly matches the Come And Get Your Love opening of the first) i feel Marvel separating themsleves more and more from formula in movies like this, i mean theres still that adherence here and there, the whole \"foil the villains nefarious, galaxy threatening plot, save the day\" is still the fall back, but even so it's done here in a more off kilter \"Gaurdians\" way. There's also heart a plenty, even a few moments that might bring a quivering tear to your eye or two. In a world going to hell, i think we need more heart and humour and hope, and this movie gives you all this in droves, i think we might be needing some more soon. Oh yeah, theres a theme tune sung by Hasselhoff , how fucking great is that?",

The film gives off minimum plot but gains massive occurences with regards to the story.\n\nApparently, it did make it up to the standard that the predecessor sets up, but with its familiarity, a little predictive storyline and sub-plots makes a huge loop hole. The guardians never did get a huge team work as what they've done from the first one, making them rambunctious all over the movie but deliberately gives 'em their own spotlight. GOTG vol. 2 gives as much for what 'action-comedy' entertainment is. It is indeed familiar but never a clich\u00e9.

Also, is it just me or is everyone practically invincible in this film? Sometimes they fall 20-30 stories and just land on their feet and keep running, I get it's a marvel film but it took away the element of danger you felt for the characters. Last but not least, there were so many moments in the film that were simply convenient, fallen down a massive hole with no way up, don't worry, the rocks around you will start floating to the surface all of a sudden...broken your metal fin thing that goes on your head?

Sure it's about Starlord meeting his father and a lot of chemistry is put into that but it doesn't have the substance to make it memorable or interesting.

Rocket Racoon is more of a stand out character in this one to me but Michael Rooker also delivered in a very unexpected way towards the end. Kurt Russell is a great addition, but his powers along with Chris Pratt's new found powers develop into an over the top climax that went a little overboard.

Not easy, given how the Marvel films are constantly upping the ante in the delivery and keep setting new benchmarks. It was highly entertaining, and hilarious. It's a notch up from Vol 1, now packed with more characters that you know will play a part in the bigger Marvel Cinematic Universe. Despite its adrenalin packed visuals, it was surprisingly emotional and touching. I think many will come away from the film touched by the idea and meaning of family. I felt a choke in my throat when Yondu said, \"he may be your father, but he was never your daddy.\"  Loving the way this film is uniquely woven by the 80's music that runs from Quill's cassette in his walkman. Love Groot. Love Hasselhoff. Great casting. Most of all, am very impressed with director, James Gunn who capably pulls this off.",

This is not an especially bold statement, considering it's nowhere near my favourite genre, but Guardians was breezily paced, aesthetically brilliant, infinitely likeable and drew more laughs out of me than any movie I'd seen in ages. So I walked into GOTG 2 with a lot of hope. In short, it's fantastic. James Gun has taken his quirky, mismatched quintet of contrasting personalities and pushed them all further than ever before. The actors have lost nothing since the last instalment, clearly very comfortable in their white/green/grey and red/furry/wooden skin. Not one of them is left without a conflict, and all are compelling in one way or another. I don't think the structure is as tight as the first one, and the father-son storyline didn't interest me as much as the story of how the Guardians came together in the first place, and the 3rd act is pretty bloody busy, but for over 2 hours the filmmakers deliver everything that we loved about the original. Witty one liners, relatable heroes, stunning space battles, gorgeous foreign worlds, the constant subversion of heavily tense and dramatic scenes with sprinkles of unexpected comedy, and do I even need to talk about how great the soundtrack is? GOTG2 may have a hard time matching its predecessor, but it never feels weak or like it's slumming. It's got laughs, drama, high emotional stakes, toe-tapping songs, and Kurt Russell. What more could you possibly want?",

In \"generic Marvel comic book movie: issue 57\", the sentinels of the stars have a bunch of 1970's radio staples litter the John Williams-lite soundtrack. There's gratuitous murder of multicolored anthropoids (with quips). They double down on the psychedelic overload, and there are more evocations of the importance of family than the latest \"Fast and the Furious\" franchise feature. Let's not forget all of the snarky moments from the trailer! Really, the only enjoyable part of the film is the sardonic punchlines. You know everything is going to be fine, relegating everything in the film to, at best, a great episode of \"Doctor Who\" and, at worst, a normal episode of \"American Dad\". Aside from the few laugh out loud moments, I am at a loss for positive things to say about the film. It is a middle-of-the-road kids movie. There is hardly a story, and what little plot there is is in service of the headache-inducing CG set pieces. Can you really call them set pieces if the scenes are just strobing colors and crumbling rocks? I'll admit it: I'm done with comic book movies. For anyone who isn't a man-child (or an actual child), the only good watch you will get out of this is a Clockwork Orange-style, eye-lid free acid trip while listening to Monster Magnet's \"Ego, the Living Planet\" on a non-stop loop. It is better than \"Thor\" 1 and 2, \"Iron Man\" 1-3, \"The Avengers\", and especially \"Ant Man\", but that's not saying much.",

Where the first volume was team building, this is all centred around family, even when the family is as dysfunctional as these guys. Drax (Dave Bautista) steals any scenes his in, though Baby Groot comes a close second. Again at the very start Marvel use some great effects to make a certain start look like his 1980s self. The second third is a look at the various team members stories and around Quill (Chris Pratt) true parentage. The final act is the big bad(s) reveal and the team trying to clean up the mess. This is a film to go see with a crowd who can laugh together at the various misadventures of these team of (as the admit) A-holes. Watch out for Stan lee who make a few appearances in this.

Baby Groot is the standout star and his moments are some of the funniest in the film. \nThe magic is still there, the gangs all here and by doing something different and original Marvel remains way ahead of its competitors.",

            "content": "Guardians of the Galaxy is exactly what the Marvel Cinematic Universe needed in 2014. It was something that introduced the more sci-fi elements, yes, but also something that broke the superhero fatigue, at least temporarily. Sure, there have been Marvel moments that feel unique: Thor 2's climactic subway chase taking on a Bug Bunny-esque madcap style, The Winter Soldier's surveillance paranoia. But Guardians of the Galaxy felt more like Star Wars than Iron Man 4, taking a ragtag crew and letting them hop around a universe that had no restraint in reality, or even preconceived mythology given their relative obscurity to figures like Thor. And everything clicked for it, from its well-tuned cast that benefited from just-pre-superstardom surprise turns from Chris Pratt and Dave Bautista, its colorfully constructed universe, its memorable quasi-irreverent soundtrack, and the instantly iconic Groot.\n\nWhen the marketing cycle for Vol. 2 started, there was immediately reason for concern. Not because these elements were missing, but because the trailers seemed to lean into these elements incredibly hard. Liked Drax being obtuse? We'll focus the first clip released of precisely that. That Baby Groot dance everyone loved at the end of the first? You bet he's going to be everywhere in trailers being all adorable and stuff. Looking for '80s hits? We'll release the soundtrack in a bag of Dorito's to make sure you hear them. Looking for references to Night Rider? Fuck it, we'll have David Hasselhoff on the soundtrack. For something that was a breath of fresh air three years ago, everything looked pretty stale.\n\nIt's no surprise that Vol. 2 delivers on these items, for good and for bad. What does come as a surprise is that, rather than build on the previous film to make a tighter experience, Vol. 2 is a much looser film, both stylistically and plot-wise, than maybe any other movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It very much feels like the Marvel execs put their complete faith in director James Gunn, as the DNA of his previous films Super and especially Slither is all over Vol. 2. Vol. 2 is nearly a best-case scenario in giving a genre auteur a whole bunch of money and telling him to have fun, and as a result Vol. 2 wears influences from Star Wars (obviously) to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (hilariously inventing and immediately exploiting the rules of its universe) to The Thing (magnificently nearing body horror more than once). Taika Watiti's Thor Ragnarok has a chance of pulling a similar trick soon, and Joss Whedon's The Avengers clearly had his fingerprints all over it, but Vol. 2 is the rare MCU film that feels more like a creator's vision than a brand obligation, even more so than its predecessor. In a way, it feels more like Darkman than Iron Man, which at this point is a very good thing.\n\nAs for the old characters, there it is a bit more mixed. Drax is probably the biggest victim of sequel fatigue, as the surprise of discovering that character's quirks was a big part of the pleasure in the first. There are no new dimensions to Drax here, so the gags involving him simply aren't as surprising. Baby Groot, on the other hand, is an absolute treasure. Sure, he's adorable, and the kids in the audience loved him, but he's often used as a vehicle for considerably darker humour than expected. As for the others, Gamora is generally a bit wasted, and Quill is a bit less of a wise-ass thanks to his position in the plot, but Michael Rooker's Yondu is brought back to great effect, and Rocket Raccoon is still a lot of fun. On the new front, Kurt Russell's Ego is a slithery presence, oozing that old-school cool in fitting with the 80s stylings. Considering the general failure of MCU villains to make any impression, Russell is top-tier. Even the secondary villains, a race of genetically engineered bourgeoisie, are a ton of fun and would have been interesting enough to carry their own movie if called upon to. \n\nPlotwise, Vol. 2 is focused on family, especially the bond between fathers/father-figures and sons, but extending to sibling relationships and, of course, teams. While there's plenty of boilerplate talk about the Guardians being one big family, the film overall nicely focuses on relationships between two people, putting together as many combos as possible and examining their familial stance. Sure, Quill/Gamora comes back up, and Quill/Ego is all over the trailers, but the film finds some depth in the bipartite relationships between Quill, Yondu, and Rocket Raccoon, even giving Yondu a father figure of his own, and further explores the Gamora/Nebula sisterhood to surprising effect. Yes, it does boil down to a dastardly plot eventually, but it avoids magicla MacGuffins like infinity stones or whatever and ties its developments into actual, believable character interactions.\n\nBut more than anything else, Vol. 2 is stock full of a few deliriously fun setpieces. The final battle goes on for about ten minutes longer than it should have, but the opening scene beautifully sets up a major battle only to have it occur out of focus in the background, while a fight involving Yondu, Rocket, and a horde of space pirates can only be described as a beautiful composed spree of violence. Throughout these sequences, Vol. 2 is willing to be completely cartoony, which weirdly makes it a standout among superhero movies. It takes risks, and is sure to dismissed as dumb by some, but it entertains in ways that are novel for a film of this budget and scale. It successfully transplants low-budget cult-horror visuals and ideas to the biggest budget scale there is, and is by a huge margin the best future midnight-movie in the MCU. Bring on Volume 3.",

The first half of the movie is a lot better than the second half and the movie starts waning after Yondu's red needle massacre scene. Peters dad was way too 1 dimensional bad guy and that bothered me a bit. Nebulas and Gammoras ark worked as well as Mantis and Drax. The arks that didn't work as well was Gamora and Starlord and Starlords and his dads scenes worked for the most part.But Yondu, Rocket and Groot stole this movie completely. The movie has a hard time finding were to focus but the jokes are spot on and it's great adventure with familiar faces.\nscore 9.0/100\n\nUpon second watch\nI realized a lot of the jokes didn't work as well and realized that on both watches I didn't get very emotional in Yondu's death. In the first watch what stood out the most was the comedy and on second watch what stood out the most was the plot. I stand by the 91/100 as I was entratained on both instances.\n\n1 month later\nKinda forgetttable. Logan and Wonder Woman look a lot better tbh in my head.",

            "content": "I should begin this review by stating that I am far from an MCU fanboy, and find many of the series' instalments adequate, but far from stellar. This is a feeling I largely held until the original 'Guardians of the Galaxy' arrived - a fun, fresh and funny addition to this cinematic universe, with a genuinely likable cast. In short, it was, by far, one of my favourite films in the franchise at the time.\n\nBefore sitting down to watch 'Volume 2', I was excited, yet sceptical. Whilst early reviews were positive, they all assured me that it was not as good as the first, and in some places a retreat of its predecessor. Having seen it, I am inclined to agree, but more of the same is far from a complaint.\n\nFirstly, to focus on the plot. It achieves many staples of a good sequel. It expands on the universe (a lot!), develops the characters, and improves upon its predecessor (which is the case here, in places). I was worried, judging from the trailers, that the film may be trying to show more than it had time for, but fortunately, this was not the case. Instead, it introduces us to new races and organisations in the universe, making it seem like a much larger place that appeared in the original. The characters are well- developed here, and the relationships between them are clear and concise, however, the majority of time was allocated to Chris Pratt's Star-Lord, and whilst the rest of the cast did have decent screen time, it is clear that they were not the priority here, despite the all-round stellar performances.\n\nSecondly, the soundtrack returns and is as glorious as ever. The use of music felt more frequent that in the previous film, and could prove a little unnecessary at times, but overall, the song choice was impeccable, and in some cases had a real relevance to the events unfolding on screen. The inclusions of Cat Steven's 'Father and Son', as well as Fleetwood Mac's 'The Chain', were very welcome.\n\nThe humour was another standout of the first film, and delivers here in droves. It often hits, but the frequency and unresting presence of jokes can ruin the more sentimental or serious moments in the film - causing a wavering tone that isn't quite sure which way to turn. Despite this, I can say that in my opinion, this was the most emotionally impactful film in the MCU to date, due to investment in the characters and how likable they are.\n\nIn conclusion, this film was a satisfying follow-up to the original, and I would struggle to determine which of the two is superior. The characters are as engaging as ever, the set pieces are glorious (despite a heavy reliance on CGI, rendered beautifully). The soundtrack is possibly better than the first (perhaps a little overused, but quality nevertheless), and the humour is largely on-point, but can be very in your face and ruin emotionally significant moments. All in all, this is worth a watch, and I will definitely be coming back to it once it is released on home video.",

I loved it! Fast forward to 2017 and the eagerly anticipated sequel.....OMG agonising poor, I had lost the will to live after 30 minutes and wondered if the storyline had been crafted on the back of a postage stamp. All the positive elements of the original were quashed under a raft of motion blur CGI, calculated bad humour, excessive violence and predictable soulless characters. I watched in disbelief, mid film at the self indulgent \"let's play catch\" energy ball scene between Starlord and Ego! I was ready to walk, but remained seated bearing in mind that I had just shelled out \u00a340 notes for the family. Consensus from our small band of travellers, all of which are avid Guardians fans.....we had just witnessed the ruin inaction of a classic film. I am sure the zombie masses will love it and will beg for more of the same........",

I felt after that film, Marvel seemed to lack what was so great about the films. Civiaal War had way too many characters, with a complicated plot and reason. The first half of Doctor Strange was good, but was let down by it's trippy second half. Throughout this movie, you get everything you excpect from a Marvel film. Comedy, awesome effects, great cast, and an interesting plot. I felt like the plot was a slight improvement from the first one, but stayed true to how the first one was. Over all, in my opinain, it's one of the best marvel cinematic universe movies. So go and watch it.",

A tiny bit too long and sentimental, the film relies more on jokes than on plot fore its best moments, but there are a few worthy efforts around the themes of family, fatherhood and sisterhood - yet nothing particularly novel in the universe of Hollywood and Disney.  The romance between Quill and Gamora  does not advance much either. Still, the spirit of the first film is there, quite intact, and the music and the humor save the day again and again (not so the imagery, too often over the top). Special mentions for two characters, Drax, by far the most effective at making us laugh, and super cute baby Groot.",

The whole movie is hilarious, the cast has an unbelievable chemistry and Michael Rooker steals the show from Chris Pratt, who also has a great performance. The visuals are stunning, the action set pieces are good and the soundtrack keeps being awesome. However, there are some issues: the pacing is off, the comedy becomes forced, Karen Gillan is the worst part of the film, even if the Nebula-Gamora subplot is interesting, and the main story isn't as captivating as it should be since the supporting characters are terribly misused.\"\n\nFull SPOILER-FREE Review @ http://wp.me/p7N9MN-1fU\nRating: B",

My expectations where high as the first was so unexpected, funny and successful at introducing these characters, so this film was always going to have a tough task to be an improvement. It's by no means a bad film, but when compared to the first it's not quite on the same level. This is probably funnier than the first, but story wise it's lacking a bit and the action is largely a CGI fest - with some of it being a bit cartoonish. All the existing characters were good and baby Groot steals most scenes he's in. The gold characters you see in the trailer didn't really work for me and they're in it a fair bit as the antagonists - so the film suffers a bit when they're on screen. There are also 5 after credits scenes, with one in particular being very funny with Groot. Enjoyable film overall.",

Don't get me wrong, the characters were as fantastic as ever, the jokes kept coming and the soundtrack worked very well with the action (unlike Suicide Squad's attempt to use Bohemian Rhapsody). But aside to this, the plot was a bit boring. While the standout moments were with Rocket, Groot and Yondu, they served very little to the overall plot. The other characters suffer as the plot revolves around Quill and his father, who was very well played by a still great Kurt Russell.\n\nI'm not saying this movie was bad, in fact it is one of the much better Marvel movies. It has one of the best developed villains in the whole MCU (well kept secret in the trailers). On the other hand, the pacing was a bit muddled and the balancing between the characters wasn't great. Very enjoyable, but not as outstanding as its predecessor.",

What happened?. Well that have introduced characters with the pretense of giving more fluency to the film, but has not been effective, there are some things that have no importance, etc ... The most surprising is the appearance of Stallone, although it appears as a cameo, But at least it is the same movie as the first one, as it is still entertaining, but it seems that it is the ones that have to be seen better on television.

It's like we have been given a command: \"This year you will see the following movies and not hold them to any standard, kapeesh!!\" \nAnd so this year, the cycle begins with us giving our money to Guardians of the Galaxy V2. Expect nothing more than what the trailer has to offer. Or see the first one again and it'll be the same as seeing V2, you'll just save money. The story does advance with Kurt Russell starring as Starlord's dad. Kind of a rehash of \"No/Luke....I am your father.\" It's good when they hire good actors. Make-up and special effects are great. But in all, I wouldn't use the words \"enjoyable\" or \"exciting.\" I'll just say, \"Ritual completed, onto the next superhero movie.\" Hey I'm a victim here nonetheless. I'm not criticizing people for seeing Guardians, as I also did, but I'm getting to get critical of us who every year, dish out our money for these superhero movies, which are in fact not becoming any better in quality, and studio execs thinking that they are creating masterpieces because of the gross $$$, hence thereforth making no extra effort to make a better movie. It blow my mind that critics always give the Disney mcu movies always a pass ALWAYS this movie is below average at best with some cool scenes that's it and it has right now 88% WOW how predictable.",

The tone of the movie is carried on the back of the brilliant score, much like the previous film. But where the previous film lacked any significant character arcs for our protagonists or a fully formed villian, this does not. Kurt Russel and Chris Pratt work well together on screen and the rest of the cast carry their roles very well. Bradley Cooper as Rocket kills it throughout with some marvellous voice acting and Dave Bautista delivered consistently solid one-liners. The movie is slightly let down by a very strange editing decision, pulling away from a dramatic scene seemingly just because we hadn't seen the other characters in a little while. I didn't buy into baby groot who is very clearly made to be as sweet as treacle for the marketing. All in all i don't think that the third act will hold up as much as previous marvel entries due to the high emotional stakes which once explored can't be re-learned.As a film-goer i walked out of this film buzzing with my mate about the scenes and jokes we enjoyed.

The opening shot/scene is sublime and it seems the reverse age CGI FX technology has reached a whole new level. I won't say too much but when you see it, you'll know.  The initial credit scene is pure joy. As the credits crank you're treated to a huge fight between the guardians and a giant space monster. The camera work by James Gunn will leave you stunned and the FX are incredible but it's baby Groot who steals the show with some dance floor moves while the battle rages behind him that's so fucking cool your jaw will be on the floor. That opening sets the scene for what's to come and it's flawless!!! \nThe plot is awesome. The whole cast are having a ball and like I said earlier the FX this time round are nothing short of phenomenal. There's amazing banter between them all and Rocket is funny as fuck. Kurt Russell is great and Michael Rooker has a bigger role as Yondo and has a great time playing the part too. \nWith the first Guardians film, James Gunn captured lightening in a bottle and the film was an amazing experience. I'm here to tell you guys that James Gunn has done it again. Guardians of the Galaxy 2 is a fun, joyful and spectacular ride. You will NOT be disappointed by this movie. It's as good as the first one if not slightly better and it's definitely in my top 2 Marvel movies. With Thor:Ragnarok and Spider-Man: Homecoming arriving later this year the Marvel juggernaut keeps rolling on with no sign of stopping and I can't freaking wait. Guardians 2 - 10/10 \nYour move DC.",

It might seem like an overly simple purpose for a film to have, but Guardians 1 (and now Vol. 2) go way beyond this. Not only are they both stellar examples of original, creative ways of engaging audiences, but also too they dare to go deeper than other Marvel films ever have. On the surface the films are deceivingly light and humorous, but under that the raw emotions of some very real characters can be seen, and the evolution of their relationships with each other are more than fascinating . A magical combination of brilliant script-writing by James Gunn, amazing casting and a famously well-chosen soundtrack, not to mention a stunningly delicious panoply of colour and bold CGI effects are the ingredients that make up this 21st century masterpiece of a film. This perhaps is a biased opinion, given my emotional connection with this franchise, but nonetheless, this film is to be cherished and admired for its bravery in going to new places for an audience ready and waiting to see another surprising Gunn feature. Special mentions must be given to Sean Gunn and Pom Klementieff for their outstanding performances - their roles were unique and their acting superbly appropriate.\nBiased, I know, but an outstanding feature regardless.

Many will undoubtedly dislike the lack of surprise from the first movie, and in regards to that I will say this: while the first movie was to introduce these characters and come up with ways to unite them, this one is to explore them and come up with ways to keep them together. All returning characters get insights adding dimension to them, which unfortunately backfires at least once when the movie decides to jump from one drama scene to the other without much variety (action, for example) in between. This happens specifically on the second act.\n\nA person that doesn't remember everything about the first movie and how it ended will get lost easily, but someone who does and enjoyed the characters in that movie will find it a great experience when all characters get these new insights along with great acting (although new characters Mantis, Ayesha and Taserface could've used more deepness, unlike those core ones). It's undoubtly more about family and visual wonder than the first one, with particularly memorable scenes often enhanced by songs from the great Awesome Mix Vol 2.",

It turns out that's working great for the characters and is one of the main reasons why the final act works fantastically. It pushes all the right emotional buttons (hehe) and ultimately makes for a deeply touching ending, redeeming some of the superficially funny parts of the beginning. Great cameos and Easter eggs for Marvel fans complete the picture. Not as outstanding as the first part, but still great.

I like both almost equally but the GOTG2 just nudges it out slightly. It's kinda the James Gunn movie I wanted from the first one. It want all in on the comedy and wackyness. But! It does compromise the plot but honestly almost all Marvel movies have shitty plots so it was great that it really didn't care to tell the story in a coherent way and focused in on the fun. It's comepletly scrapped the boring mcguffin style plot of the first one and went for something more character driven. The movie works great as a collection of scenes where you just have fun with a bunch enjoyable characters and my good is the comedic timing perfect most of the time. There's two super long dragged out still shot joke (Similar to the \"planning the breakout\"-scene in the first one) that is pure perfection. It also handles the tone shifts alot better and it's the best looking movie Marvel made, they thrown away the washed out look and gone for full contrasty and deep black images with a high dynamic range. I even wanna rewatch it in 3D. They even nailed how to make all the scenes look and feel cool incomaprison to the first GOTG which ended with them standing in a line holding a stone.\nWhat's bad? Well, the music wasn't as well handled this time. They didn't feel as natural as the first one. There is alot of stuff going on and cutting back and forth between events so the casual fan might be unable to follow what is happening and get into all the characters. There are scenes that are even too corny for GOTG but hey they where in the first one. The use of Slowmotion during dramatic scenes was cheesy in a bad none selfaware way. As mentioned the plot is a mess but whatever anyone who watches a Marvel movie for the story doesn't know what a good story is. The first 1/3 kinda feels like arguing the movie and for fuck sake Hollywood can we stop having characters spell out the main theme of the story right in direct dialogue for the audience. We are not dumb, stop stating the fucking obvious. If they didn't pay enough attention in the movie to get it that's their own problem.\nAll in all. GOTG2 did things better then GOTG1 but it also does thing worse then GOTG1. Thus they are about equal. Which one you prefer is honestly just up to what kind of experience you are looking for.\nIn my case I'ts going to be this one.\n8/10.",

A significant portions of Guardians of the Galaxy plot-lines are driven by Quill's *on-going* interactions with his enormous jerk of a father.\n\nThere are plenty of other significant changes to the characters from the comics e.g. Drax being officially an alien (he's actually human, sort of, in the comics). I don't mind the back-stories being simplified for the movies, but Guardians of the Galaxy was already one of the most accessible comics out there and has only been around since 2008. It's not like many of Marvel's other assets, where characters were created over 50 years ago and in need of an overhaul to remain relevant. Changing the characters may not have been a huge issue if their motivations were replaced, rather than simply omitted, which is the case. Comic book characters aren't exactly renowned for being well rounded, but wow, the ones on screen in Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2 are unbearably shallow. They no longer have any reasonable back-stories or motivations to behave the way they behave - the only character who seems reasonably on-point is Rocket - being as simple as he is, he's pretty hard to mess up.\n\nGamora has changed quite a bit from the comics. Without Marvel Cinematic Universe having access to X-men, and hence Kitty Pryde, her interactions with Quill are one of the few changes that actually makes sense. But ah, what's the deal with making all the bad guys into good guys? This isn't a 90s feel-good flick, is it? Way to just throw a whole bunch of story-lines down the drain. Combine that with the removal of J'son and you've really gone and screwed over future writers quite a bit. I'd hate to be involved in Adam Warlock at this point!\n\nSomehow, for an action flick, the action is too mindless and boring, even for a Marvel action flick. Sure the film looks good, and there's a few okay one-liners in there. However, as a whole it's hugely disappointing given how much potential Guardians of the Galaxy had. I would have thought Deadpool opened the door for humour, adult themes, and reasonably in-depth characters to co-exist in super hero films... Apparently not.\n\nA real \"swing and a miss\".",

Well you answer the questions. \n\nVol.2 follows up where the first left off, Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) still has no idea who his real father is until a not so chance meeting with Ego (Kurt Russell) who straight away no spoilers tell hims he is his father. From there we go into Spoiler territory and I won't do that. \n\nThis is a film like other Marvel films is again setting up more character development, characters, locations and anything else that has to be used. It suffers a little BUT it is still very entertaining to watch!\n\nJames Gunn said in the beginning said this film will be about Peter learning about and finding his father and that is the film. Drax (Dave Bautista) and Gamora (Zoe Saldana) don't  get as much development in this, more along for the ride, BUT Yandu (Michael Rooker) gets a whole lot more screen time and is made better with his involvement with Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and Baby Groot (Vin Diesel, YES VIN DIESEL DOES BABY GROOT).  They are a great trio on screen which makes every scene, even though at times can drag on, Be very fun! \n\nBABY GROOT, The best thing that will be remembered about this movie will be this most adorable little baby tree thing running around being very naughty! \n\nSly Stallone is in this and....i can't say anymore. \n\nAwesome Mix Volume 2, THIS IS GREAT AGAIN, even though like the first film they left out my favorite song on the soundtrack, they made up for it with \"Southern Nights\" and its scene it was playing in. SO GREAT!!! \n\nYes, You need to see this for future Marvel Films 3/5 on the important scale. \n\nIt has its flaws, but I couldn't care less. I enjoyed the hell out it!

Marvel Studios have got these E list heroes and made them into A list heroes, now even people other than comic book fans know them.\n\nThe sequel to the movie that beat TASM2 at the box office is not surprisingly phenomenal. James Gunn expands this colourful universe and continues to develop these likable characters. These characters are what shapes the story in this sequel. Dave Bautista and Michael Rooker as Drax and Yondu are the real standouts within the fantastic bunch of characters.\n\nI recommend you watch GOTG again before going in for this outing. Because if I hadn't I would have greatly regret it. There are numerous connections and plot points this sequel picks up on. Even some of the dialogue are significant call-backs to the first entry. The story in this sequel feels like a needed meaningful continuation unlike other recent blockbuster sequels.\n\nGunn displays the best opening credit scene ever! The third act of this film is the best act unlike other MCU films. The message of the film is deep and will have you thinking.\n\nThere are countless surprises throughout the film, which probably only fans with an extensive knowledge of comic books will understand. This is the first MCU film to have 5 after credits scene, at least 3 of which people without an extensive knowledge of comic books, the general audience for a better term, will not understand or be satisfied by.\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 is the definition of a sequel. This is a spectacular start to MCU's 2017. This is the type of film that will stick to your heart for some time. The sequel is worth seeing again while it plays in theatres to catch all the juicy references and easter eggs. Gunn produces a strong sequel that does not disappoint. 9/10.\n\nP.S. Can people stop bringing their babies to the very first screening of a film. They cry during the film and ruin the experience, same thing happened with Captain America: Civil War last year. There are some people in the theatre that wait years for a film.",

First and foremost let me say it is really good!\n\nThere is always the fear that the sequel will not live up to the original, I mean, look at any marvel cinematic universe film with a 2 at the end (Iron man 2, Thor 2, Averngers 2) all disappointing, not terrible movies but big let downs from the originals.\n\nGuardians 1 took us all by surprise and we were sucked in by the world and the characters that James Gunn brought to life. A rag tag bunch of misfits with plenty of charm and swagger to keep even the most sceptical film goer entertained. The risk here was bringing these characters back and basically getting another dose of the same characters and plot points and being left disappointed. Luckily this film stands out for two big reasons.\n\n1. Because we know and love these characters, Gunn leans on them more than ever, even when the action looks as amazing as any big budget action adventure film, it always comes back to these characters and because we know them so well the emotional moments in the film REALLY hit!\n\n2. James Gunn brought himself into the Marvel universe with Guardians 1 but anyone who has seen any of his films knows this was James Gunn light, he can go full weird and crazy and totally freak an audience out. You can see in this film that Marvel are very comfortable with Gunn showing more of his flare, this isn't fully balls out like his film Super but you can see has been given license to let his quirky nature seep deeper and deeper into this world. This is more violent while still being Marvel friendly, ruder without alienating the mainstream filmgoer and honestly darker while still keeping its hip and vibrant colour palette.\n\nIf I have gripes about this film they are really minor, the opening of the film feels very cheesy like these characters have been allowed to shoot the shit for the last 3 years without anyone telling them what's funny and what's not. Not to fear, they hit their straps about 10 minutes later and it's smooth sailing after that. The soundtrack is also a bit of a letdown, don't get me wrong, still solid and the high points of this track list are amazing but as a collection of songs its not as catchy or as iconic as Guardians one. There's a great little bit that reassures fans that there is plenty of room to be playful in the soundtrack for Volume 3\n\nTo sum it up, the film is great, it stands alone as an amazing film but also as a great follow up to the previous film. For fans its a must, for new comers, come in and enjoy the ride!",

            "content": "When Guardians of the Galaxy first burst onto the scene back in 2014 no-one knew who this gang of misfits were and it surprised everyone with kick-ass action, gut busting humour, and tonnes of everlasting fun. It very quickly became my favourite Marvel movie and the franchise i had no expectations for suddenly became one of my most anticipated. James Gunn returns and largely delivers on more of what you love about the first film and he even does a couple things much better, but in the end it didn't quite reach the height the first one did. The action is all there with some very big, fast, and impressive fight sequences, the humour is present with a few great running jokes and the occasional big laugh-out loud moment that hits a few times. The characters you all love are back and well, apart from Groot they thankfully haven't changed. And the story, the story is where this film surpasses its predecessor as it is more interesting, engaging, and incorporates a villain who is much better than Ronan the Accuser. \n\nThe strongest part of this franchise is most definitely the team dynamic within the Guardians that is so rich and full of humour. The distinct personalities of Starlord, Gamora, Drax, Rocket, and Groot and how they all clash and interact back and forth throughout the film is just as fantastic as ever. It lends itself to plenty of humorous moments, some decent character building moments, but overall it allows you to remain invested in this team and all of the characters involved. The other characters such as Nebula, Mantis, and Yondu were also great with Yondu definitely being the biggest highlight of the three of them. Nebula was good although her place in the film was plentiful but not as involved in the film as a whole, rather she was there to serve a side plot that was executed pretty well throughout the film. The story i won't go into because even with seeing all the trailers there is a lot about this film that is still very secret and it is best to experience everything in the moment. I was much more invested in this story than i was in the first Guardians film so in that respect i feel like it surpassed the story of Ronan's flawed universe crushing plan. \n\nNow where the story was fantastic the film does take a dip in the overall flow during the second act almost in its entirety. When the guardians get to a certain planet in the film the pacing pretty drastically slows down and what follows wasn't particularly bad it just wasn't as engaging and did feel kinda disconnected from the rest of the film, like it almost stopped. There is a lot of character building in this act, a lot of plot detailing, and overall it was moving at a really slow pace and dragging a good amount. Even though during this dip the action is taking a back seat at least the humour is still present and helps to get you through it easier. But despite this average at best second act the first and third acts of this film are damn-right fantastic. The action is big, plentiful, and at times beautifully chaotic, the third act especially is where shit goes down and it is i think the best stuff we have seen from the guardians yet, so look forward to that. \n\nThe humour was a big part of the first film and it is definitely a big part of this one. It's integrated into the action sequences very well, especially the opening sequence (similar to the opening sequence of the first film). It does a good job at using running jokes to a good length and not running them into the ground, and the humour is pretty well spaced out. Where in the first film essentially none of the humour missed, there were a few misses here and there but it's hardly anything worth criticising. There also weren't as many big hilarious moments that catch you off-guard, there were a couple but overall i didn't laugh as much as i guess i'd have hoped. \n\nDespite the films flaws this is still a great movie with ample humour, enough action to thoroughly entertain you, and most importantly it is still a tonne of fun. The character dynamics explored are fantastic as you'd expect and the new additions to the cast are great characters with great performances backing them, that includes Kurt Russell's introduction as Ego. I would love to praise this movie as highly as i did the first guardians film and give it the highest score but then i'd be lying as even though the first and last acts are incredible, the second act just isn't too great. I shouldn't have to tell you this by now but as this is a Marvel film there are sequences during and after the credits. This time though there are FIVE SCENES, so don't leave after 1, 2, or 3, stay right to the end until you see all 5. \n\n7.7/10",

Sure, it's not as novel or zesty as the original, but it's still one of the best sequels in a long time. It still looks - and sounds - great: vibrant colours, plenty of action, both in space and on strange planets and another killer soundtrack that will grow on people as well. Great use of Fleetwood Mac and Cat Stevens, in particular.\n\nPeter/Star Lord (Pratt) is back with his rag-tag friends/family - Gamora (Saldana), the almost-love-interest; Drax (Bautista) who's both endearingly stupid and means well; Rocket (Cooper), the alienated racoon and Groot (Diesel), in ultra-cute baby-tree form. Yondu (Rooker), Peter's adopted father and Nebula (Gillan), Gamora's sister, are dragged back into the fray, as Peter's father finally appears - Ego (Bridges, charming as ever). There's some great cameos - Hasselhoff, Stallone, and, as always, Stan Lee (+ The Watchers) - and some good development of Mantis (Klementieff) and Kraglin (Gunn).\n\nThe main plot is all about family - Peter and his new-found father, as well as his odd relationship with Yondu (and Gamora); Gamora's love/hate relationship with Nebula; Rocket being lonely and struggling to accept that he cares for others; and them all looking after Baby Groot (excellent post-credits scene too). Obviously, a great final battle scene and plenty of laughs throughout.",

The visuals and sight gags are as mind-blowing as ever (IMAX 3D is the way to go for the best viewing experience). And the '70s soundtrack is sublime.

All while trying to survive against enemies in the process.\nNow before I go any farther, I want to say that  the first one was an MCU masterpiece. A true staple in pop-culture. When I watch a sequel, I expect it to be better or the same as the first.\nThis installment did not do this, but it was still a lot of fun.\nI was five minutes into this film and I thought to myself, 'This is going to have a ton of CG isn't it', and just as I suspected, it had a lot of CGI. It was good CGI, but there was a ton of it. It also delved deeper into the characters that we were introduced to in the first. I had one problem with the the Character development though. It took almost the entire movie to figure out who the main antagonist was. For me, that was pretty confusing.\nThe acting was fairly solid. It could've been better considering that a large percentage of the cast was completely brought together with visual effects. The comedic side was solid as well. Like I said, it wasn't as good as the jokes in the first, but they were good enough to laugh at.\nMy biggest complaint is that there are times when the story gets dull. It was mostly reasonable, yet there are a few scenes where Peter develops a relationship with his father. Those scenes got old very fast.\nEverything in this movie that wasn't perfect was sirtenly good.\nOver all, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 wasn't as good as the first, but that doesn't mean it was bad.

            "content": "Are we here to save the galaxy again? Yes. Was Vol. 2 better than Vol. 1? No. Is it still a good movie? Overall, yes it is and very enjoyable, too. How many post creds? There are 5 mini post credits. What is your favorite track from Vol. 2? The Chain by Fleetwood Mac which is what I'm listening to as I write up this review. How should I watch it? Definitely IMAX like the sound and picture quality was just amazing for a movie like this. \n\nThe gang is once again back together to save the galaxy once more and doubling up their payment. What has been considered as one of the most anticipated movies of the summer is for the most part a great movie that is able to maintain many aspects that made the first one so great. The group has once again been able to maintain the laughter. This time, It was Drax who leads the \"assholes\" with so many jokes and personal stupidity. Lets also not forget our favorite Groot, being the cutest of the cute and being a typical baby he is. The more surprising character who steals the show is actually Yondu. He has more character development in this one compared to any other character in Vol. 2 and even more than he had in Vol. 1. Lets just say as a way to avoid spoilers: He is the Real MVP. Also, the visual effects were once again amazing as usual, complimenting many of the great actions scenes, especially at the end. Also, the movie once again was able to maintain the groovy 70s and 80s music and concept with the colorful galaxy theme which is why we loved the first movie in the first place. (Not gonna lie I'm too obsessed with the Chain song by Fleetwood Mac). At the same time, I do appreciate a bit more of the serious tone in this one as the movie is going into a more personal level compared to the first one, especially since Peter's father appears for the first time. Also, once again the guys had a great performance, especially for Pratt who had to show a different side of Quill we hadn't seen before and also props to Rooker as well who had a lot more screening time. But really the music is just amazing. Like there was once scene where the Chain song by Fleetwood Mac is playing and it just fits so well with the scene like I was having some chills. Definitely a lot highlighted scenes and actions. \n\nHowever, there are flaws to Vol. 2. First off, there are inconsistencies in characterization. Unlike the first one where every guardian had some purpose to their storyline, Vol. 2 gave more importance to some characters like Yondu, Rocket and Starlord but weakened others like Nebula and Gamora. Yondu as I mentioned had the most character development, which increasingly made the character more likable unlike the first. Gamora in the other hand really served little purpose in this one. I understand that she has a fit with Nebula from the previous and had to somehow address it but I felt that the plot for it was just so quick and weak. I just didn't feel at sympathy for such relationship between Gamora and Nebula whereas as the relationship between Yondu and Peter was a lot more understandable and meaningful. Heck, there was more development between Yondu and Rocket than Gamora and Nebula. Another thing is that the plot was a bit lost in the beginning. It probably took until the 30th minute to really understand what was really going on, especially since there were a few too many subplots that caused the further confusion. This somewhat caused the inconsistency but eventually it brought the pieces together. However, once it picks up, it does have a nice story to it that feels a bit more different and emotional. Lastly, Marvel's villain issue is still ongoing on this one. Not to spoil, again it was a bit lost to what was going on but once you learn more about the villain, the villain seems a bit more dangerous than other villains we have been exposed to but this villain has the least purposeful reason as to why he wanted to do such thing in the first place. However, the villain was actually quite powerful and cruel in comparison to many, even perhaps a level up in how the villain tried to accomplish his goal. Lastly, this movie is definitely a bit more personal in some character developments, so it is suppose to be a bit emotional. However, I felt it didn't reach that level that I had expected. I did have feelings at the end but not enough for me to say that it was a tearjerker. Had the story been a bit more focused and organized, this issue would perhaps been solved. But I do applaud Gunn for taking a different approach to that and trying to change the tone a bit as it is a bit more personal. \n\nVol. 2 is certainly not the best Marvel movie and definitely not better than the first. However, it isn't a disastrous film and doesn't disappoint as much like Iron Man 2/3 and Avengers: Age of Ultron. Vol. 2 in the end is still a lot of fun to watch to a point where I really don't care about the noticeable flaws in the movie. Lets also add that Vol.1 was an unexpected hit that no one initially had faith in and surprised people whereas Vol. 2 already had expectations which may also add the growing flaws. So, our expectations may have affected that a bit. Nevertheless, I ended up enjoying Vol. 2 and smiling by the end of the movie, knowing that this movie is all about bringing back a great group of characters back to make us laugh and root for them to beat the bad guys like what you are suppose to get from a superhero movie. Lets also add the stupidity that just ups the laughter level. In a way, I think Vol. 2 is funnier than Vol. 1, just not entirely organized like the first. Also, I just can't help but thinking how great the track is for the movie. It also takes a more personal level take, which wasn't entirely done right but still enough for me to have some sympathy for some characters. I think people should definitely watch it for the fun and laughter and just enjoy it as if you are a kid watching a Disney movie (oh wait? It is owned by Disney but you know what I mean). I may even say that I may watch it a few more times, probably a few months from now, just not in the next week or so. Don't expect it to be the Oscar type or that will just make you disappointed. Enjoy what makes the Guardians of the Galaxy great and follow that mindset in Vol. 2. That way at least you leave the theater happy and knowing that you had a great deal of fun. Just want to emphasize, Baby Groot is the cutest thing ever to a point where I need a baby Groot. But to emphasize, I really liked it for the most part and had a lot of fun out of it.",

The special effects are (obviously) great. It's a lot of fun, the characters wit is still there, and baby groot is well, what you would expect him to be. The only problem I have with this movie is that it's pacing is a tad bit off.

Volume 2 could have just settled for more of the same, but instead I am happy to report that it addresses nearly all of its predecessor's problems, resulting in a vastly improved motion picture and yet another crowned gem in the seemingly infinite sea of creativity that is the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Guardians 2 opts for a more personal narrative that dives deep into all of its characters on an individual level, fleshing them out much more than the previous film while also upping the ante with its zany brand of humor. Culminating with a final act that actually carries emotional weight as it delivers the spectacle, Guardians 2 ends up as a near-masterpiece from James Gunn that oddly isn't getting as much credit as it deserves. Critics clearly didn't see the same film that I did, because this is obviously the bigger, better, and funnier film with greater character depth.",

I will say my only real complaint is that Baby Groot wasn't featured as much but his scenes were hilarious. I was glad we got to see more of the relationship with Nebula and Gamora and more of insight to how cruel Thanos really is. Everyone has their moment, we get a lot more Drax, who gets the best one liners, Dave Bautista's dry delivery is perfect and really makes you laugh out loud. Make sure you keep your eyes peeled for a lot of Easter Eggs and for the 5 end credit sequences, which more are for fun, one sets up Guardians 3.

The golden antagonists known as \"The Sovereign\" are there for little more than to be generic bad guys. The climax of the film, while thrilling, goes on and on for way too long. Lastly, one of the big reasons why the first film was such a hit was the fantastic soundtrack. This time though, the hit songs if yesteryear feel very forced in and far less organic to the story.\n\nAll that considered, this still amounts to a very fun film and an adventure worth taking.",

The Guardians represent a pivot that Marvel movies have made toward a cosmic and comedic style compared to the more grounded comic-book fare. The additions of Kurt Russell (Ego the living planet) and his servant Mantis were compelling and memorable characters that expanded the mythos of the group and added elements of emotional depth, especially for Peter Quill and Drax. Michael Rooker returns for a more substantial role and also provides an unexpected emotional core that establishes his character as one of the unsung standouts of the greater Marvel Universe. The villain (the movies glaring weakness) falls apart during the climax of his arc by ignoring the thoughtful set-up built through the first two-thirds of the movie and becoming a monstrous over-large CGI video game boss. It's important to note; the Guardians are only part of a much larger MCU plan, and despite the bungling of this movie's antagonist, the story did a great job of setting up an even more important villain, Thanos. Through one character's accounts of his brutal torture, they added to the mysteriousness that I'm hoping gets paid off in 2018's Infinity War. It goes without saying, Baby Groot is adorable, and I'm sure sold lots of toys. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 served as a great episode in what is basically a big screen Marvel Cinematic Universe television show.",

            "content": "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is back and flashy as ever when it comes to its visual style of action, soundtrack, a fun cast, and the laughable humor. Usually sequels can be a let down after its predecessor set the standards high. And the build up momentum for the sequels is easily forgotten. Writer/Director James Gunn manages to continue what worked on the first movie and expand further with the characters he brought together. Yes, it is a ragtag of misfits that try to be a team and argue to each other with their own personal issues. In the end, they see each other not as friends but family. \n\nThe plot follows Peter (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), and Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) are tasked at fighting away a giant monster and protecting valuable batteries. Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki) the leader of the sovereign race, who needed the guardians help for the task. After a dispute, leaving the guardians on the run away from Ayesha and her army of drones chasing them away. The guardians crash on a planet, where they come across Ego (Kurt Russell) who is Peter's father. Ego takes Peter, Gamora, and Drax to his planet. Meanwhile, Rocket, Groot, and Nebula (Karen Gillan) stay behind their wrecked ship, only to come across the Ravagers led by Yondu (Michael Rooker). Trying to claim the bounty on the guardians that is set by Ayesha. \n\nGuardians of the Galaxy 2 has everything you can expect. It has plenty of action and the visual effects were colorful, and impressive. When Peter and his team visit Ego's planet. The visual effects were astonishing. The set pieces were great too. It does have its fun share of humor. It is fun to see a dysfunctional team trying to get along; you have Peter and Rocket with their arrogant cocky self. Nebula and Gamora personal conflict that keeps them fighting each other. The one thing that always drives Peter and his team is how they see each other as family. Also, there is baby groot which is always a scene stealer. Groot is small and cute, even from the opening moment of him dancing and needing music playing as the guardians are fighting against a giant monster. \n\nThe villains are usually what worry me, as several Marvel movies later. They all have that same motive and have that clich\u00e9 routine. I was worried for a second in this film about who and what the villain was. Without giving away spoilers or details. This film villain is by far better compared to the first movie. Definitely, the villain does not show until later. It definitely leads the direction into a big climax with the guardians trying to save the galaxy yet again. \n\nThe guardians are tested personally as Peter, Gamora, and Drax are separated from Groot and Rocket being with Yondu. Gunn never lets a single moment become dull. There are easter eggs, celebrity cameos, etc. Also, there are five mid/post credit scenes that are worth checking out unlike the first movie end scene of Howard the Duck that was a waste. \n\nOverall, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a visually exciting sequel that surpasses the original. It has a fun cast and characters, the soundtrack is awesome, the visual effects and action is exciting, the villain is an interesting one, and James Gunn's fun direction makes it a flashy fun movie.",

            "content": "After the incredibly original, fun, and fresh Guardians of the Galaxy, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 tries to be a successful follow up and mostly succeeds, though it might feel a little forced. The film opens with a space battle, shortly after the events of the first film and for the next hour there is no apparent plot. There are plenty of jokes, laughs, and action sequences in the first two acts, but they are meaningless and almost tedious. It is not until the last act that a story becomes apparent, and the film goes from okay to good. Kurt Russell does great as Ego, Chris Pratt is still good as Star-Lord but not as good as the first film. Improvements in characterization include Gamora, Nebula, Rocket, and Yondu, who all develop an emotional backstory that ties the film together. But certain characters like Baby Groot, and Ayesha have no development or worthiness at all. Drax is still funny, and newcomer Mantis is a welcome addition to the Guardians. The finale is spectacular, in contrast to the rest of the film, and the payoff is very emotional as Peter finds who his true \"daddy\" is. Vol. 2 plays more like an episode of a T.V. story than a sequel to an epic superhero story. It is very focused, and is one of the smallest-scaled Marvel films ever made. In the end, it was fun to see the Guardians again, but Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 does not live up to the first film, and stands as middle-of-the-road Marvel entertainment.",

Volume 2 is far too wrapped around its soundtrack, baby Groot's cuteness and its director's corporate loyalty like a python on a trash panda but it's funny, awe-inspiring and touching enough to fit in with this tidal wave of great Marvel movies. I can't imagine Infinity Wars solving the character development issue but if these actors continue to do wonderful things the issues won't matter much and I'll continue to be giddy on the edge of my seat like a tween. Kurt Russel, Dave Bautista and Michael Rooker both make and steal this show, a spectacular show that's worth the price of a few IMAX screenings.",

If the series was not tied to the bigger marvel world I think the world of Gunn would deliver every film. The franchise feeling is there but if that's my only gripe that's about the only issue I had. The complaints that the film fail to deliver the novelty of the first film should grow a brain, don't compare. The film has a strong 80s feel which is very welcome in the marvel world, you almost forget half way through the story really hasn't revealed itself yet. No spoilers here but the humour is fun and the franchise is now established away from the core universe. I don't have the greatest of feelings with the overloaded Avengers film next year and this film seems less intent to follow the others. I really hope this succeeds ten fold and James Gunn is allowed a threequal that is him unclipped at 11. This is a great slow revealing plot that may have the ham-fisted conclusion but it hits all the right beats. Another Guardians film after this is very welcomed, the empty Avengers film is already in the making, time will only tell where that leaves the marvel universe. 24/04/2017.\nI have revisited this film and I have dropped my rating to a 3.5 and it's mainly due to the inconsistent tone of the film. Gunn had the characters laughing and it just felt overbearing at times, the film wants to care but they don't take anything serious. I watched this film at the movies and it played well, just on reflection it isn't the best film and I got certain parts wrong. Good cast and an adorable Groot can't overcompensate a mixed bag of filmmaking. 20-08-2017.",

            "content": "This is easily one of the worst comic book movies I've ever seen.\n\nThe humor is so forced and so cringey I could barely stomach it. There's a part where they're being chased by a bunch of ships and are still cracking jokes, with Rocket telling Quill he's going to put a turd in his pillow case, and that it'll be one of Drax's. Drax then starts bellowing like a goon and says, \"I have famously huge turds.\" I almost walked out of the movie at that.\n\nBaby Groot is so annoying. It just shows how stupid society has actually gotten that people love Baby Groot. He's essentially Jar Jar but instead of people rightly being angered by such a horrible character getting focused like in the 90s when Episode 1 first came out, now everyone loves Baby Groot. With my Marvel loving friend telling me I \"obviously lacked a soul and heart\" since I didn't like Baby Groot. The start of the movie has the giant monster from the trailer, and instead of showing the whole fight, it focuses on Baby Groot as he dances to music while the fight is blurry in the background.\n\nThe story is bland as usual with MCU movies. It's just Peter's Dad needs Peter to help him activate these seedlings so he can take over other planets. All with bountiful jokes.\n\nDrax was the only part I enjoyed of the first Guardians. His deadpan humor made up for the forced humor of the others. He took everything literally in the first film and that's what made him funny. Like the \"everything goes over his head\" line which he replied, \"nothing goes over my head, I'm too quick, I would catch it.\" But in this movie he's \"AHAHAHAHAHAHA EVERYTHING I SAY IS A JOKE!! AHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHA WHY ARE YOU NOT LAUGHING? THIS IS WHAT MCU FANS LOVE!! AHAHAHAHAAHHA MEMES!!!!!\" And he didn't do much in the way of \"Destroying\".\n\nThere's a part of the movie where Quill covers himself in rocks and turns into Pacman, which I immediately thought \"oh, this movie is the comic version of Pixels!!!\" Not a good thing.\n\nI think the one scene I really enjoyed was the Ravager funeral for Yondu at the end of the film. That was it. The rest of the movie was just joke, joke, joke, reference to old songs, jokes, serious scenes that played out pretty nicely and then ruined by jokes, and more jokes.\n\nFive post-credit scenes. None of which mattered.\n\nEveryone's singing this movie's praise. Which doesn't surprise me. Everyone loves the MCU and always give these movies a pass on being terrible. They love the humor and don't care how basic the plot is. I honestly believe if Marvel Studios put out a two hour movie of a Marvel character sitting at a table and just sipping a cup of tea it'd get a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes and the Marvel fanboys would call it cinema at it's finest.\n\nThe movie is so bad it's cringe.\n\nDon't waste your money, even though you no doubt already have.\n\nIt's just so bad. So, so bad. Everyone laughed at the horrible jokes, but what had me laughing was the outrageously high score on this site.",

Having now seen the movie, I can safely say that the wait was well worth it.  Guardians 2 was freaking awesome! I loved it and I wanna see it again.  After looking at some reviews, I feel that Vol. 2 is getting unfairly criticized for not being as \"fresh\" as the first movie. But I think that many people are failing to realize that it is literally not possible for a film sequel to be as \"fresh\" as the original, whatever that means.  And furthermore, Vol. 2 is just as inventive as Guardians 1.  When you really think about the sequel, not that much actually happens in it, yet the film is still extremely entertaining.  And it takes some serious guts and skill for a movie to be able to pull that off.  Guardians 2 also takes the time to add more dimension to its characters, including some characters who aren't necessarily audience favorites like Yondu and Nebula.  Rocket also gets some added and welcome emotional depth.  As expected, Vol. 2 was fabulously funny and the soundtrack was kicking.  I might be riding on a high, as I just saw the movie, but I honestly liked it more than the first one.  I was so happy to see the Guardians return to the galaxy and to theaters and I can't wait to see them again.",

            "content": "I wasn't sure what to expect from the 2nd installment of Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, but much like thr first film, i got more than I bargained for. \n\nThere was no sophomore slump for this loveable band of  interstellar misfits. This movie was just as funny, quirky, and exciting as the first, yet added some real elements of emotion that the first film lacked. \n\nWhile the first film had a focus of all the characters feeling each other out, this film showed them much as more of a family. In my opinion, that is the main theme of the movie, family. The family we have always had and may take for granted and the family we may have always we wanted.  \n\nSome of the jokes were a little more on the adult side this time around, so maybe dont take your 5 year olds, but all in all it was a lot of fun. I will say it seems as though Marvel's parent company, Disney had effect on the end of the film. \u00c3\u00c3,\u00c2\u00b0~\u00c3,\u00c3,\u00c2\u00a2  Any one who has seen Up or Inside Out knows what I mean.

Awesome Mix Vol. 2 wasn't nearly as impactful as Vol. 1's was. The songs are great by themselves, but they just didn't seem to fit right in this one; kind of like pressing in a puzzle piece that doesn't quite fit the space.

            "content": "I'm just goanna come out here and say it, Guardians of the Galaxy is one of my favourite movies of all time. Each and every one of the cast is fantastic, it's visually stunning; the action is nothing short of fantastic, the story is surprisingly emotional and it is by far one of the funniest movies ever made, I'm not being hyperbolic I actually believe that. So as you can see I have a huge soft spot for Guardians of the Galaxy to me it's one of those movies that's great in almost every possible way. But enough about that movie because as amazing as Guardians of the Galaxy truly is I'm not here to talk about that movie oh no. I'm here to talk about the highly anticipated follow up to that movie Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. \nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is one of my most anticipated movies of this year and one of my most anticipated movies of all time and that is partly due to how much I love the first movie and also because I'm a huge Marvel fan in general. Marvel to me have made some of the best superhero movies in general. Some great examples would Iron man, the Avengers, Captain America the Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, Captain America Civil War and of course Doctor Strange. Lately Marvel's movies never fail to entertain me and the MCU as a whole is one of my favourite movie and TV franchises of all time.\nBut now Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 has finally been released in cinemas and as you can imagine and also because of the title of this review I've seen the movie already and now I'm here to share my thoughts on the movie with you guys and after seeing it I can most can definitely say that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 one of my most anticipated movies of all time... is one of the greatest super hero movies I have ever seen.\nThe level of greatness that this movie is currently at is on the level of Watchmen, the Incredibles, X- men Days of Future Past, Deadpool, Captain America Civil War! This sequel not only manages to be an entertaining follow up that more than lives up to its predecessor but it also manages to do something very different in the superhero movie genre and still manages to be an awesome movie at the same time. I'm just going to say it here and now, hands down this movie is the most fun I have had in the cinema all year, once again I'm not being hyperbolic at all I absolutely truly believe that.\nFor starters the cast here are absolutely fantastic. I loved Chris Pratt as Star Lord in the first movie and I loved him even more in this movie. Chris Pratt is a really funny and likeable actor and he puts that to great use here and I really like that. I really like what they do with Star Lord as a character in this movie, seeing this world through the perspective of someone who never got the chance to grow up with a real farther, who really wishes he was able to do that is really enthralling and it's through that character element that the relationship between Star Lord and his farther Ego the living plant truly blossoms (and before you guys complain about me spoiling potentially an important plot point of the film, let me just tell you that that technically it isn't a spoiler when it's in the freaking trailers thank you very much).\nFor me watching Star Lord Form a relationship with his long lost farther was actually really emotional and there are some moments in particular that had my eyes fill up with tears. The relation between these 2 characters is realised remarkably well here and that is definitely the movies strongest element in fact that's another pro. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is just as emotional and tear jerking as the first one. The more dramatic scenes in this movie are handled really well and make for some excellent drama and I'll admit there are a couple of scenes near the end of the movie that actually had me crying and watching Peter and Ego bond throughout the course of the movie was actually a really emotional and heart-warming. It actually reminded me of all the things I used to do with my Dad before he passed away. I related to Peter Quill in that sense because believe me I would give anything to see my Dad again and I haven't had the chance to grow up with my Dad having my back and it was really cool for me to find a character in a movie like Guardians of the Galaxy that I could relate to in that sense.\nAs for Ego the living planet. This is character I've been wanting to see in a Marvel movie since day one, so as you can imagine I was super hyped that this character would be appearing in this movie and thankfully Kurt Russel who plays Ego is fantastic in this movie, he gave a great performance in The Fate of the Furious and he gives a great performance in this movie so that's 2 times in a row that Kurt Russel has blown me away this year. He makes for a very intriguing character and at times a pretty creepy character but he also comes off as very off the wall and really charming. Overall I would say that Ego is one the MCU's most intriguing and unique characters and overall a great addition to the MCU.\nI loved what they did with the Guardians as a team in this movie. The introduction to Ego actually sets up a conflict between the Guardians in this movie and I loved how that was handled and I enjoyed seeing that conflict grow as the film progressed because you have someone who's finally found the farther he was never able to grow up with and really wants to connect with him and do everything a farther and son would do and then you have the rest of the team who are not certain on whether or not to trust this person. This all makes for dramatic tension between the team that I feel doesn't go unwelcomed and I think it really helps to strengthen the idea that Guardians see each other as family and it was cool to see what would happen if someone who jeopardises that bond came into the lives of these people.\nOutside of Star lord and Ego though the other characters in this movie are also fantastic. I liked what they did with Zoe Saldana as Gamora and Karen Gillan as Nebula. We get a closer look into their backstories in this one and I think I had a better understanding of their sister hood in this film than I did in the last. The relationship between these 2 characters was great in the first film however I think it's improved upon in this film and the actresses playing these characters give great performances and bounce off each other really well and as a matter of fact that brings me to what I feel is the best story element in this film and just the best part of the movie in general, family.\nThe theme of family is the driving force of this movie. We have the heart-warming farther son relationship that is formed between Peter and Ego, the troubled yet touching sisterhood that is shared between Gamora and Nebula and even this team of characters just feels like one big inseparable family of misfits, even the chemistry between our heroes just screams family. This theme is used to its full potential in this movie and works remarkably well building more emotional depth to the characters and I think it's an interesting theme to have as the main focus of a super hero movie and thankfully it works really here in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.\nDave Batista as Drax to me is perfect casting choices at its finest. He manages to make Drax one of the film's most interesting characters while at the same time coming off as absolutely hilarious in the best way possible, the socially awkward aspect of this character has always been one the best parts these movies, from the way he inappropriately laughs in people's faces to the way he takes metaphors way too seriously always makes for good laughs. Bradley Cooper as Rocket Racoon was absolutely hilarious, I really like how they switched things up a little with Rocket and Groot's relationship, Rocket is now having to protect Groot who is now the size of your average twig and is having to act as a sort of protector/ farther figure and that was really cool to see and as for Baby Groot, I'll admit I was worried that were going to force the idea of Baby Groot on us a little too much but thankfully they didn't and not only was he absolutely adorable but he was also  hilarious and it never felt like he was just there so the audience can think \"Oh my god he's so ADORIBLE!!!\" I must say though that I did end up liking Mantis quite a bit in this movie, she was a fun and likeable presence in the movie, I was worried that she would annoy me when I first saw her in the trailers, however in the end I liked her quite a bit in this movie and Pom Klementieff who is the actress that played her in this movie gave a really good performance as the character on the whole..\nI have to say a pretty big surprise for me in this movie was actually Michael Rooker as Yondu. For me he was probably one of the most interesting of all the characters in this movie. We get to learn more about what he believes to be the true meaning of being a ravenger and we even get an insight as to what it was like raising \tPeter and training him to become a ravenger and just what it might have been like to raise him. Strangely but in the best way possible he has some of the film's most emotional scenes for example there's a scene near the end of the movie between him and Peter and that had me crying. But similar to most of the characters in this movie he has fair share of gags and humour that almost never fail to land perfectly.\n    Now the first Guardians of the Galaxy was very effective its comedy and the whole way through that I was laughing my ass off. In terms of how effective the humour is in this film, I'm going to be completely honest, I haven't laughed that hard since Deadpool. The comedy in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is amazing. Quite literally every joke or gag in the film had me going from chuckling to outright laughing hysterically. If there's one thing marvel always seem to nail in their movies it's the comedy and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is no exception.\nA group of people that I think really deserve praise here are the visual effects team. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is the most visually stunning marvel movie to date, yes even on the level of Doctor Strange. All the space battles look amazing; Ego the living planet looks incredible. I would also be whiling to say that this is definitely the most colourful Marvel movie as well as being one of the most colourful movies I've ever seen in general and in a really good way. Every single affect in this movie to me is virtually flawless and there are so many effects that will either blow you away, have you staring at the screen in awe and in some cases both. In other words definite well done to the visual effects team they have truly out done themselves this time and as you can imagine the action in this film is also amazing.\nThere are a lot of truly awesome set pieces in this movie, they are all shot, rendered and choreographed really well and the action sequences are genuinely entertaining. If I were asked what my favourite action sequence in this movie was I would honestly find it breath takingly hard to decide because every action sequence that followed was always as entertaining as the previous sequence before that.\nAnd now the soundtrack, oh my days, the sound track for this movie. The sound track for vol. 2 has been stuck in my head ever since I walked out of that theatre. This movie has by far my favourite soundtrack out of anything marvel with a personal favourite being 'The Chain' by Fleetwood Mac, from now on that song will never fail to get me pumped up.  \nYou would think it would be round about here at this point in this already very long review that I would begin to explain some of the problems I had with the movie, but here's the problem. When I walked outta that theatre I came to the realisation in my mind that there was literally nothing I disliked about Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 in fact this might actually be my favourite marvel movie. James Gunn you've done it again just like with the first movie you have brought us a visual spectacle that is a hysterically funny, heart-warming and emotional movie about family that still manages to be a one hell of a kickass superhero movie. I mean I don't even have to say it; of course you should go and see this movie, you will have a blast watching it. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a definite must see!",

            "content": "While Guardians Vol 2 (aka the Drax and baby-Groot comedy hour) is a fine film, it lacks the spunk and persona that made the original stand out. While this is still the best collection of characters in the MCU, this movie lacks in giving them depth and room to grow. They almost tread on some characterization with Rocket, but the film spreads out over too many storylines to adequately do anything with it and his character feels flat as well. The film also just feels more confined and less adventurous. There are less locations, less action sequences, and less jabbing jokes between our leads. And, in Marvel tradition, the villain is cliche and uninteresting. Everything the first movie did well, this one does not quite as well. It felt like a movie that needed to be done so they can start filming Avengers 3. It's funny, entertaining, has a wonderful soundtrack, and is vibrate in its colors and scenery. But ultimately the first Guardians was far better at all of the above, along with providing an interesting plot and character arcs.",

While not as fresh or as captivating as the original installment, it adds upon the lore of the Guardians, as well as the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While this film is extremely funny and looks great, it can at times feel like just a filler movie for the MCU, which it ultimately is and ends up being. Regardless of that, this movie does seem to fix a bit of Marvel's villain problem, and without spoilers, has the first villain in a Marvel movie that I have thoroughly enjoyed. It also adds onto the villainous nature of Thanos, and even though he is not shown in the movie, the story arch between Nebula and Gamora gives his character a stronger background that gets you excited to see him in Avengers: Infinity War. Overall, the movie is exciting and funny with a great cast, and is a must see for all Marvel/GotG fans. 4/5",
