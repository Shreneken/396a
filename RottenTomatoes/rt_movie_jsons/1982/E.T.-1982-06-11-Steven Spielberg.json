    "summary": "After a gentle alien becomes stranded on Earth, the being is discovered and befriended by a young boy named Elliott (Henry Thomas). Bringing the extraterrestrial into his suburban California house, Elliott introduces E.T., as the alien is dubbed, to his brother and his little sister, Gertie (Drew Barrymore), and the children decide to keep its existence a secret. Soon, however, E.T. falls ill, resulting in government intervention and a dire situation for both Elliott and the alien.",

I guess all the emotional details were lost on me as a kid.  I look forward to seeing this again in theaters in a couple months, I'll bring a box of kleenex.",

            "content": "ET:The Extra Terrestrial is one of Steven Spielberg's better movies, funny, touching and just wonderful. It not only entertains very young children and their parents but it reaches out to the child within us, that is something I want to feel when I watch a movie from my childhood. I love films like Beauty and the Beast, The Wizard of Oz, Mary Poppins and The NeverEnding Story for exactly that reason. The film is beautifully filmed, with breathtaking cinematography and beautiful scenery. The scene with ET and Elliot on the bicycle is just an amazing scene, I think John Williams's amazing score is to thank for that. The special effects are excellent, and the script is funny and touching. There is one sight gag with ET hiding among Elliot's stuffed animal toys that warms my heart every time. The acting is very good, with Henry Thomas appealing as Elliot and Dee Wallace sincere and sensitive as the mother. I also loved Drew Barrymore as the sassy and big-mouthed sister. What makes this film though is ET himself, even with his large eyes and long arms for an alien ET is adorable, sad and sweet. The part when Elliot cries when ET is dying is a real tearjerker, it kills me every time I see this film. Overall, I love this film, it is so special and delightful. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

One such reviewer said this was copied from 'Mac and Me'. All it takes is two minutes to do your research and to the person that posted that - don't spread false info. Mac and Me was released in 1988 and was a blatant rip off of E. T.\n\nThis movie is a true masterpiece. I first saw it back in 1994 and it stuck with me since then. I miss those times terribly, however I can imagine how amazing it would have been to see it in cinemas back then! It is one of the best films ever created accompanied by one of the best soundtracks to ever be recorded. It is charming, funny and tear-jerking and the plot is straight to the point with each scene executed beautifully! This movie is a must watch and an all time-classic.

Not like we send anybody to the moon so why would they send anyone of their species to our planet? \n\nThis a is a nice movie. How ever I am going to say what many others is afraid to say; this movie doesn't feel like I could watch it over and over again such as other classics from its time because they specifically targeted this for kids in a way that they actually make the adults in the movie feel way too redundant. Like immediately the mother must not know. The way they had the teacher without showing his face. The group of people looking for the alien. Every adult feel like an authority figure that mostly cannot be trusted leaving only the kids, so even though this movie is really good, it's just not the same as the other movies that I could relate to the characters. So if you've seen this as a kid l, then the memories will always be with you and you will always feel that Nostalgia but if you haven't then it's just a kids movie with alot of whining and kind of feel cringe. \nSpielberg work shines in this movie with stunning cinematic scenes especially of the woods when the aliens arrived and the use of the lights been reflected and his icon scenes of mimicking emotions. Especially seeing the remastered version is absolutely stunning. The sound is really good but I didn't feel it has sound that made me go wow and be in awe. The sound is actually quite straightforward. It's a great movie how ever it's always going to be along while before I see this movie again.",

It not only entertains very young children and their parents but it reaches out to the child within us, that is something I want to feel when I watch a movie from my childhood. I love films like Beauty and the Beast, The Wizard of Oz, Mary Poppins and The NeverEnding Story for exactly that reason. The film is beautifully filmed, with breathtaking cinematography and beautiful scenery. The scene with ET and Elliot on the bicycle is just an amazing scene, I think John Williams's amazing score is to thank for that. The special effects are excellent, and the script is funny and touching. There is one sight gag with ET hiding among Elliot's stuffed animal toys that warms my heart every time. The acting is very good, with Henry Thomas appealing as Elliot and Dee Wallace sincere and sensitive as the mother. I also loved Drew Barrymore as the sassy and big-mouthed sister. What makes this film though is ET himself, even with his large eyes and long arms for an alien ET is adorable, sad and sweet. The part when Elliot cries when ET is dying is a real tearjerker, it kills me every time I see this film. Overall, I love this film, it is so special and delightful. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

It may have the Marvel TM overarching hero journey but so does *checks notes* basically any adventure/sci-fi film. Highly recommend seeing this film and judging for yourself!

            "content": "Simply put, ET. THE Extra Terrestrial is THE best film of the 1980's and one of the greatest American films of all time, as well as one of the most beautiful and innocent. It really deserved to win both the Best Picture and Best Director Academy Awards of 1982 over Ghandi. And Drew Barrymore deserved an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Her performance at SIX years old is simply amazing and so natural. Here in 2021 it's easily forgotten what an event ET was during the summer of 1982.....and the fact that it held the top spot on the worldwide and domestic box office for a staggering record of 15 years, until the release of Star Wars in January 1997. Any film holding the domestic box office record for 15 years now is unthinkable....although The Force Awakens $936  million seems completely untouchable now. People also forget ET was really a tiny little film, made for under 10 million dollars in 1982...somewhat low budget even in 1982. But with the king of the box office, Steven Spielberg at the helm and John Williams' INCREDIBLE Oscar winning score, ET soars like a $100 million dollar film. It's larger than life. And while we're talking about John Williams' score, incredible, powerful, triumphant and heartbreaking all at the same time. I would call his music to ET the greatest film score of all time if it weren't for Star Wars (1977). Most of us who grew up with the film know all the stories about the inception, inspiration and production of the film so theres no reason to repeat what countless reviews have said about the film. This review is strictly about the importance of the film and the pop culture phenomenon it became. Those of us who are lucky to be old enough to have seen it during it's original theatrical run in the summer of 1982 will never forget the experience. It's one of the most vivid memories from my early childhood. I remember it like it was yesterday. I saw ET for the first time on my 5th birthday, July 19th 1982. I was taken to Walmart before the film for a Skelator He-Man action figure and Castle Greyskull playset. I went to see it at the Belle Meade Theater in Nashville Tennessee, one of the oldest and nicest theaters in the south. I remember bouncing out of the car in excitement, the hot, humid summer evening air hitting me, and the bright orange summer sunset. We sat in the upper balcony, which was my first experience in a theater like that. I cried the entire way home, and my mother had to read me the ET storybook to get me to fall asleep. There are some things you never forget. And the first time seeing this beautiful film is a memory those of us 43 and older will never forget. ET will always be the true box office champ to me. And if you disliked or hated this wonderful achievement in filmmaking then I feel sorry for you because you have a cold, black heart.",

Unfortunately, scientists are on to E.T. staying at their home and puts E.T.'s well-being in danger.\n\nI purposefully have not watched \"E.T.\" since the first time I saw it back in 1982 in fear that the magic that I now vaguely recalled while watching it back then would be killed.  As I watched the movie all I could think was this isn't as engrossing a movie as I remembered and the special effects are definitely not up to par with today's standards.  \n\nThen comes the big scene on Halloween night and suddenly I realize I have been sucked in completely without even knowing it.  Let's just say thanks to the pandemic I stocked up on Kleenex because I cried like a baby several times during the last 30 minutes of \"E.T.\"  It was also super cool that I did not recall how it ended.  It made watching again for the first time in decades an even better treat.\n\nSpielberg knows how to pull together movies to rope you in and play with your emotions.

This is REALLY dated though, not just in the available technology, the quality of the practical effects, or that the little girl (Drew Barrymore) was drinking and doing coke backstage (allegedly?).  The FEEL of it, the music that was clearly borrowed (and possibly expanded) for later projects.\n\nAs good as it is, writing is probably the strongest aspect, and there just isn't that \"oompf\" to compete with modern movies.  It has weak touches of charm here and there, but it wants to be more of a 1980s dirt comedy than a family movie of wonderment: honestly reminds me a lot of \"Paul\".\n\nAnd part of me just hopes this isn't what first contact looks like: stupid terran kids aside, E.T. had to have been senile or retarded (no, it not funny) for this series of events to happen.  He knows he's from off planet, and maybe EVERYONE on his ship knows how to make a transmitter, but when he thinks he sees another alien he speaks English to it.  Details like that are littered through the movie and will break the magic you should have (and it's there) when Spielberg wanted you to just concentrate on the shot he created.\n\nI don't think you'll have a bad time, I probably just got too close to the screen.",

Nothing has changed as I viewed it in 2020. From the design of E.T., Steven Spielberg's signature hazy backgrounds, great casting (emotions by Elliot are out of this world), an unforgettable soundtrack: they hit all the right notes in what I think is Spielberg's best film ever.  He was the only person on the planet that could have pulled this movie off so seamlessly. Nothing really looks dated and the story pulls you in from the start. Spielberg's understanding of children's psychology is what makes this movie so memorable and just leaves you feeling all good inside.

He doesn't shoot for break-your-neck special effects, rather he gives it to you in glimpses. We see the lights from E.T.'s spaceship, but we only see the actual spaceship flying for a second or two. E.T.'s ability to make things take flight is never overdone and always used in necessary circumstances. Outside of the special effects, there are a number of touches here and there, again small nuances, that make this film great. One of my favorites occurs when E.T. sees a kid in Yoda costume and starts following him. \n\nConflict: 10\n\nEntertainment Value: 10\n\nMemorability: 10\nThese scenes have been recounted and retold in a number of different ways. This movie set the precedent on how we see and interact with life outside of Earth. The relationship between Elliott and E.T. is unforgettable.\n\nPace: 10\nSpielberg is a true master of storytelling as he aces pacing yet again. There are no dull moments and the few lulls are there for a reason. Exposition and character development are handled within the context of the moving story itself as it should be.\n\nPlot: 10\n\nResolution: 10\n\nOverall: 100\nI had someone tell me once that not only was E.T. not that great, but it was pretty terrible in retrospect. My reply: What crack are you smoking? This movie is not only great, but it's one of the all-time greats. Believe it.",

            "content": "Review: \n‘E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' is a science-fiction film directed by Steven Spielberg.\nAfter a gentle alien becomes stranded on Earth, the being is discovered and befriended by a young boy named Elliott (Henry Thomas). Bringing the extraterrestrial into his suburban California house, Elliott introduces E.T., as the alien is dubbed, to his brother and his little sister, Gertie (Drew Barrymore), and the children decide to keep its existence a secret. Soon, however, E.T. falls ill, resulting in government intervention and a dire situation for both Elliott and the alien.\nE.T. is still consider one of the greatest movies ever made, and it's not hard to understand why. I just recently watched this again with my 7-yeard-old and we both had a very good time. This is a very good movie that the whole family can enjoy.\nThe overall acting was pretty good for it being a movie from the early 80's. I mean let's face it the stories were better and original back then, but the acting has come a long way. However, Spielberg pulled out a brilliant child performance from Henry Thomas. He did an amazing job as the main lead Elliot. You can watch his audition tape on YouTube and it's not hard to see why he got the job. \nWith Spielberg behind the camera, there was no way that people did not see that this was a success waiting to happen. The man does Science Fiction the way no other director can or at least has accomplished. He had three major success stories prior to E.T (Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Raiders of the Lost Ark) so having yet another brilliant success right afterwards basically cemented his name in Hollywood. The way he shoots this movie is breathtaking with a lot of wide angled takes.\nOverall, this movie is just brilliant. I know there are some people that don't believe it aged well and think E.T is just creepy and don't really by into the story. But I do. I buy every single bit of it. I highly recommend this movie to anybody who loves to sit down and watch a beautiful story about friendship, and how far some will go to help an individual in need.\n5/5",

The screenplay written by Melissa Mathison is very solid, it gives you interesting characters, and a great story. We cannot talk about E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial without mentioning John Williams, he is a genius, the score of this movie is amazing, in fact, John Williams won the Oscar for best score. Another great thing about the movie is obviously E.T, an iconic and beloved character. 37 years later and it still looks great, he is a very friendly and funny, there's a scene where he grabs some beers, and it's hilarious, that entire sequence is very funny. The cinematography is beautiful. The vfx... well they aren't as good nowadays, they didn't age well you can tell they are using a green screen, it's very obvious, I know that in 1982 they were great. There are movies like the Star Wars original trilogy where the vfx look good nowadays, or blade runner. I felt like  Gertie was annoying sometimes, I didn't like that character most of the times, but it has some good moments. But anyway this movie is a masterpiece, it's a must watch.",

            "content": "Few films manage to engage both young and old audiences in the way that this film does. I was worried when heading into watching the film that I wouldn't be impressed as I am already in my late teens and had never seen this in my youth and I was familiar with so many of the iconic moments from the film. Fortunately the film is so fantastic that I was still awed seeing shots that I had witnessed out of context a million times and I was surprisingly touched by the development that Spielberg gives to the family drama subplot. I would urge all parents to show this film to their children because it is so easy to love and savor while also being surprisingly intelligent.\n\nLonely ten year old Elliott, Henry Thomas, is left saddened by his parents' divorce as his mother, Mary, Dee Wallace, is preoccupied with other issues and his brother Michael, Robert McNaughton, is mean to him. His life changes when he meets an alien who is hiding out in his backyard after being left behind by his fellow aliens on earth. The government is attempting to track him down in order to test him and use them for their own sinister purposes. Elliott helps E.T. in his attempts to return home while E.T. repairs the relationship between Elliott and his other family members by uniting the siblings together. The children eventually achieve their goals after facing several trials but Elliott has become a man and E.T. has left him as a happier, more confident young man.\n\nThe film smartly values moments of the boy and the alien bonding and the alien bringing the family together over action and adventure scenes. We are immediately charmed by both of the main characters as Elliott is broadly appealing as a quiet, slightly sad young boy who longs to prove himself to his older brother while the alien is so darn cute in presentation that we can't help but be enchanted by him. Together the two complement one another perfectly as they are both in their own way outsiders longing for approval while also possessing unique skills and a fierce determination. The wonderment in Elliott's eyes as he discovers someone willing to accept him and treat him with respect is something that all people can relate to and E.T. is the sort of friend we all desire no matter what age we are.\n\nThe dropping in of darker elements, the references to divorce and the deep fractures between the siblings, works so well because Spielberg never loses the lightness and sweetness needed to appeal to kids but informs you of why Elliott needs E.T. so much. As Elliott's mother Wallace is fantastic as she gets the flustered but deeply devoted sensibility that a lot of real mothers going through a similar situation hold. When Elliott goes missing we feel her horror and anger as she has nobody to fall back on during these times and while she loves her son she is also weighed down upon by the responsibility of taking of caring of three children on her own. This complex discussion also makes the film universally accessible because it doesn't present an entirely cheery view of the world and sees the darkness that can come with being an innocent but wary child.\n\nIt is the iconic moments that do help the film to soar however as the sight of boy and alien riding past the moon on his bicycle will make anybody's heart melt. You respond to the beauty of the images as much as you do to the expressions on the faces of the children or the sweeping score. No, the moments are not subtle but this is not a film that ever aims for subtlety and it should not have to because it tugs at your heartstrings so effectively that you don't care that you are being emotionally manipulated. This is what Spielberg does so well as he makes films that can be universally enjoyed that also employ real artistry to get their points across and feel genuine in the emotional development of their characters. I would even argue that this was the best film nominated for Best Picture in 1982.",

People see the movie poster everywhere of the 1982 “The Thing” and know what it is!(The guy with light on his face walking hooded in the snow) I love ET but I love “The Thing” a lot more!",

Even at the relatively young cinematic age of two decades, it is beloved by multiple generations of film-goers. Yet it is arguably the most overrated motion picture to arrive in theaters during the 1980s. Obviously, this isn't a popular thing to say, and it's not meant to denigrate E.T. as being badly or clumsily made. In fact, viewed as a fable or an allegory (it's actually based on The Day the Earth Stood Still, which is a thinly-veiled re-telling of the Christ story), E.T. is successful. But there are times, especially during the final third, when it is hugely overwrought. Spielberg has always shown a penchant for overt manipulation, but nowhere is this more obvious than in E.T., where he pulls out all the stops in an effort to bleed tears from the eyes of every audience member. It doesn't take a cynical nature to recognize what the director is doing. Regardless, this is a classic. (In hindsight slightly overemotional but still great).",

            "content": "Spielberg's greatest impact on pop culture.\n\nE.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is Steven Spielberg's ultimate cultural touchstone for everyone's childhood. Spielberg redefines alien encounters with E.T. as a lovable, yet realistic puppet instead of the more mystic alien life of old stories. E.T. is what people are thinking of when they refer to 1980's pop culture. It has the child protagonist that must grow up, witty humor, pop culture references, thrilling action sequences, iconic imagery, and intriguing cinematography that keeps you in suspense.\n\nE.T. was the first film I ever saw as a child. It moved me so much that I cried. I understood the emotional connection that Elliott the boy had with E.T. even as a young boy myself. Upon revisiting E.T. as an adult, I found it largely remains charming. The wonder of the story and likability of its characters hold up well. You feel for this 80's California family suffering divorce, boredom, and bullying. You naturally empathize with Elliott's plight and situation.\n\nOn the other hand, I found E.T. to have certain aspects that so not hold up when held up to the light of modern day criticism. The acting is mostly passable from the mother and older brother in particular. They are believable and likable. Then, the main son Elliott and daughter Gertie of the movie are pretty compelling as leads. They emote well and deliver lines in a natural manner. Spielberg really coaxed respectable performances out of the young Henry Thomas and Drew Berrymore. \n\nHowever, I cannot say in honesty that they are always excellent. Their screams are incessant at times and all together unpleasant. In their quieter moments, their emotions ring true. Thomas and Berrymore play innocent, afraid, curious, charming, hilarious, quaint, and brave well to their credit, but their outrageous screeches and yells are blatantly overacted. The supporting cast are serviceable as they play their parts nicely enough with what little screen time they get. Overall, I enjoyed E.T. still regardless of the performances as the film presents its own special charm all the same.\n\nThe effects are dated as far as the CGI and green screen, while the puppetry and mini models are masterful landmark achievements in special effects history. You believe the spaceship, flying, and of course, the titular character of the alien E.T. Spielberg's crew did an excellent job building a world that we can believe in reality.\n\nSpeaking of Spielberg, the director solidified his legacy as the man who made pop culture what it is today with E.T. He lets us into this world, explore the house set, and believe in E.T. as more than a puppet, but as a character too. Spielberg continues his masterful and subtle use of shadow silhouettes in E.T. as well as emotional close up shots that hold up beautifully. The cinematography is lovely and all based in a real home and neighborhood. The direction is as focused as the stream lined story. E.T. does not overstay its welcome at a respectably short run time.\n\nFurthermore, the writing is superb. Children actually talk like real kids. The teenagers mouth off and act on their own, the little kids speak truthfully with an innocent wonder for all things new, the parents are sincere, yet aware, and the government is curious and intrusive. In all, E.T. works so well as a little adventure with a boy who befriends an alien and must accept his leaving. It's played up to be more empathetic, but it is effective. The science fiction plot-line of Elliott feeling what E.T. does is an exquisite metaphor for Elliott's empathy for E.T's emotions. I think audiences will still be moved by E.T.\n\nLastly, I must mention John Williams' most enchanting score is what absolutely secures E.T.'s place in people's mind as a cultural touchstone. Williams composed a beautiful score that varies from cues of uncertainty, leaps of fear, to flying through sky with his magically emotive music in the background. It fits E.T.'s atmosphere so well that the music is much of what many remember from E.T. years later. Williams' scored the soundtrack to many childhoods including mine as E.T.'s music is truly a major moment in movie history. Even taking off our nostalgia glasses, E.T. has a lovely and sweet symphony of feelings.\n\nTo conclude, Spielberg invents new iconography for our pop culture with each new release and E.T. is perhaps the greatest example of a movie that is magical. Anyone who views E.T. gets wrapped up in the little waddling alien and all the emotion that comes with him. It's a thoroughly charming movie that is highly entertaining to this day. E.T. also doubles as a well made film with all of Spielberg's movie making skills on full display. Watch E.T. with your children, friends, or family and you'll surely have a fun time. It's worth a watch.",

Seriously, he's done some of the most well-known motion pictures ever known to man, including the \"Indiana Jones\" franchise, \"Jaws\", \"Schneider's List\" and \"Jurassic Park\". \n\nProbably my most favorite movie from that director has got to be \"E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial\". It's the story of a lonely boy who befriends a lost creature. Now, I remember the first time I saw this movie. I was eight years old at the time and when I was watching it, I was amazed at what was happening. That was the movie that influenced my passion to be a filmmaker. I have made movies before but these films were made in high school and my first directorial effort was \"The Locker\", my eighth and final short film for high school. Now I'm coming up with more short films and a full-length feature film.\n\nThe story is absolutely fantastic. The characters are well-developed, the writing is creative and the special effects, I think these were some of the greatest visual effects I've seen since \"King Kong\". \n\nThe one thing I have to talk about is one scene and that scene alone: the iconic bicycle scene. That scene is one of the most influential sequences in movie history and that's saying something.\n\nOverall, \"E.T.\" is arguably the most beloved classics ever and is my favorite films of all time. If you haven't seen it, I ask you: Please go check it out!",

            "content": "Everybody loves E.T.  So an alien is left behind on Earth, and is seeking shelter.  A young boy named Elliott (Henry Thomas) decides to help by keeping him under wraps and looking after his safety, as many of the adults just wouldn't understand.  Now this is a classic that I really didn't grow up with.  Almost all of my peers around the same age bracket harbor an adoration for E.T., but I didn't actually experience it for my first time until just a few years back.  I thought it was decent when I finally watched it, but didn't really see what the big fuss was about.  As the years have passed, I've grown fonder of this little alien who dresses in human clothing.  Now I will be the first to admit, the reason why my goodwill for E.T. has developed has a lot to do with the charming attraction at Universal Studios.  The ride itself smells like a childhood basement in the best way possible, and if nostalgia had a smell, I feel like it would smell like the maze that you walk through to board the ride.  The one thing that you have to understand about E.T. is that it is a kid's movie.  It's not much more than a simple boy and his dog story, and it is geared toward pre-teenagers... although nowadays I don't know if they would have the attention span for E.T., with the desensitization of fast paced video games and cartoons.  Regardless, Steven Spielberg flat out knows how to craft a film, and he goes that extra mile where a normal director would probably cut a corner.  While E.T. has grown on me throughout the years, I don't think it is a perfect film.  For one thing, I do feel that it runs a touch on the long side, and while there is never a point where it grinds to a halt, there is a stretch where it slows down considerably between the second act and the bicycle finale.  This is a movie that has inspired many other projects, some with great reception (Stranger Things) to others that think that the whole point was product placement (Mac and Me).  Will E.T. forever stand the test of time?  That remains to be seen, but it is still a staple of many a childhood, and for that, it deserves credit.",

It's not supposed to be though, and for what it is it's pretty damn close to perfect.\nVERDICT: A lovely, emotional movie that takes you right back to the shoes of your childhood self.

            "content": "I remember seeing this film as a kid on VHS, but little did I know that I was watching the altered CGI Version aka the Director's Cut. Word around the web is that that particular version is a disgrace to the E.T legacy, much like the Star Wars special editions (George Lucas and Steven Spielberg are best buddies you know?). Anyway, I was able to watch the unaltered, original version shown in theatres. Sure I didn't get all the scenes I remembered as a kid, like the scene where Elliot pours Coca-Cola onto the telephone, but what I did get was pure 80's kids sci-fi magic. I really think this is the perfect way to introduce children to Science Fiction, other than Star Wars of course. Speaking of which, there are a ton of Star Wars references in this film (Another nod to Spielberg's good buddy George Lucas). The reason why this film is so beloved by many, is because of the relationship between the kids and E.T. Not only are these some of the best child performances I've ever seen, but the way they interact with E.T is so dead on. Even E.T. is cute and charming to watch. He sees the world with curious eyes much like how the children view him. I will admit, however, for young children, there are some downright terrifying scenes. For kids aged 8 and older, I don't see it being a huge problem, but there is a subplot about the government looking for E.T. which comes to the forefront later on which can be pretty dark for a kids film. Also, one mention of \"son of a bitch\", but kids films could get away with that film. Also, warn the social justice warriors for scenes of alien and child intoxication and a young middle school boy kissing a girl without her consent. I'm only kidding of course. This film takes the subject of \"are we alone in the universe?\" and turns it into wonderful kids, science fiction adventure. Every kid should experience the magic of E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial!",

It has a great cast of characters, a nice atmosphere to it, and isn't too predictable - it's made to be iconic. Something about the plot, however, never stuck with me - its second half's energy feels as low as the characters feel in that half.\nA Californian small town kid named Elliot finds an alien who has crash landed in his backyard. Taking him in as a pet and exposing him to his older brother and younger sister, they try to avoid from their mother and a scheming team of government alien specialists.\nSpielberg has ton of a great films and is a revolutionary director. I would, without a doubt, consider him one of the greatest directors of all time - I personally think Tarantino tops him on certain films - and ET is no exception. Spielberg was on a roll with alien related films in his early years as a director and ET is one of the pinnacles of his career. From the moment Elliot and ET's great chemistry is introduced, the film shines as something bold and immediately classic. Scenes like that with pure magic to it are all throughout the film. ET's abilities being exposed is great to watch and the big scene of the film is the flying bike scene, the scene shown on every poster, advertisement, or merchandise. ET also shows great child acting in a field that is hard to work with. Drew Barrymore as a kid is notable in the cast and is often brought up in discussion with ET. ET really is great, but something about the second half of the film seems really off. (Spoilers, btw) When ET is found sick and dying by Michael, the tone of the film turns from magic to bleakness - honestly this is what the film is trying to accomplish and it works but the atmosphere of the scene where Elliot and ET are both lying sick and being examined, talking to each other and a bleak white room - what once was magic turns to an odd change of tone to off putting. The end makes up for it, but even then a lot of sadness in the tone feels off for a film with a lot of imagination and color to its first half. This really is only minor, but it takes up a good half hour of the film. It seems like the film still could have been really effective without it and the ending still stay the same. ET is one of Spielberg's best and is one of the greatest childrens films ever, with a great premise, great chemistry, and lovable characters - it still holds up very well today and ET still proves as iconic as ever.",

And the animatronic alien (when they are not using CGI), is one of the greatest special effects I've seen. \n\nThe problem is that those emotional (Both Over-Happy and Over-Sad) scenes happen too often, and dragged for too long. I didn't feel as much atmosphere as I should have, instead I felt like I was watching some overly cute Disney Channel show with a big budget and big score. OK, that was too harsh...But no excuse for being melodramatic to the highest degree.\n\nI can why this is a classic for many people, but I'll just put this in the \"Meh\" pile.\n\nP.S.

Mr. spielberg can't make a movie without something gross happening in it.\nThe portrayal of aliens isn't flattering and compounded with the hostility and condescension it - apparently aliens have no sex either (plausible, but really intended as more of an insult it is made clear) - receives, if aliens did indeed ever set foot on earth, it would undoubtably be to try and pursue a lawsuit against mr. spielberg.",

There's always a mess to clean up.  One of my favorite scenes is when the mom comes home and doesn't notice ET scuttling around while she's frantically putting away groceries and picking up garbage around the house.  It doesn't matter that we don't know whether or not ET is a child, he is experiencing a new world with childlike wonder, fear, and innocence.

That's pretty much all that needs to be said, really, for it truly is a classic. A beloved one as well, although, there is some irony there (for me) because I hated this film the first time that I watched it. The project in the early stages was questioned because the creature wasn't cute or adorable, and everybody involved had the task of making audiences connect with the little fellow. The cast definitely does a wonderful job in making things feel 'real,' none of the dialogue or behavior seems out of ordinary; the younger actors cuss and act like, well, people. It wasn't until 2002 that Spielberg wanted to add some \"political correctness\" to the picture, which, thankfully, he changed his mind for the blu-ray release. Although I do prefer the little hop that they gave E.T for the 2002 edition for the opening scene, the original's movement for E.T still looks kind of weird in some of the shots, but that's a really small complaint. I'm only talking about the opening scene anyways since the actual puppet they used for the original looks superior to the CGI E.T for the rest of the movie. Another weak point of the movie (for me) would be the whole psychological connection between E.T and Elliot, it's just not something that I think of and go \"yeah, I can't wait for that scene!\" No, the scenes that really get the adrenaline going [and are now part of Hollywood's 'movie magic' moments] are the 'Over the Moon' and 'Over the Sun' scenes. 'Over the Sun,' in particular, is my favorite. Not only would I argue that it's some of the best 15 minutes ever filmed in movies, it's also some of the best 15 minutes of music ever. John Williams' score was so important to \"E.T\" [it really is the heart and soul of the picture] that for the last, like, 8 minutes, Spielberg was basically like: \"okay, you can conduct the orchestra the way you see fit and I'll edit the film to conform to the music.\" I don't know if that's happened since, but if has, I can tell you this: it won't have the achieve the same level of effectiveness. When we first meet E.T, we aren't sure what to think of him, if he's bad or good, but the characters go on to grow closer to him (and with each other) and the audience follows suit, and by the the time the movie triumphantly concludes--it's a complete journey.",

This story of a young boy whose dreams become reality when an extra terrestrial is left behind on Earth is a heart-warming tale. Elliot, the young boy who discovers him introduces him to his older brother and younger sister and they all soon become very attached. Elliot learns the meaning of friendship and family through E.T. and continues to grow a closer bond to his siblings. While hiding this from the government and his mother, E.T. becomes very sick and has no choice but to surrender him to them. The cast was very relatable to each family that went to see it, which created a sense of empathy for the characters.\nSpielberg continues with his theme of sci-fi and captures each scene intensely with his classic uses of lighting and framing angels. The use of wide lenses, held hand camera work, and dark silhouettes are just some of the classic techniques he uses in his films, which enhance each scene. This film being made in 1982 did not seem to be shown in the film as the extra terrestrial was quite advanced, as well as lighting and smoke effects. Not to mention the classic scene of Elliott and E.T. riding their bike across the hugely lit moon. This classic image became the main poster for the film and an image that never left my head after watching this film. \nThis is definitely a movie for the whole family to enjoy, a classic that you will never forget.  You will feel a rollercoaster of emotions during this movie but that is what keeps you intrigued.  E.T. has definitely won my heart over and I hope you feel the same way.",

Also, it was the box-office champion all over the world before the appearance of the \"Titanic\" in 1997. This movie was made by Steven Spielberg, one of the most famous movie directors in the United States. In 2002, \"the 20th anniversary version\" was made and some scene of this movie was re made using current technology.\n\nThe main theme of this movie is friendship; the friendship between a human being and extraterrestrial life. It is great to see the friendship between a boy named Eliot and the E.T. because it is completely new and we can enjoy the imagination of the world with the extraterrestrial life as your friend. At first, a boy was pushed about by his elder brother and his brother's friends, and also his younger sister looked down him. But after Eliot met E.T., he answer back to his brother and sister in order to help E.T.. Eliot became strong owing to his friendship with the E.T.. Also at the end, there is a scene where Eliot and E.T. escape from the enemy. This scene makes us feel very excited and I trembled.\n\nI watched the original version which is made in 1982 and the Computer graphics qualities are lower than now. So if it is possible, I want to watch this same story with all the  high image quality and the high computer graphics quality. However, if you are a fan of the Sci Fi movies or Steven Spielberg, you will enjoy this movie. This movie offers us the imagination of the existence of extraterrestrial lives and the true friendship. So I recommend this movie.",

Although I know many people like this dull, sappy, overrated trash pile, I am pretty damn baffled ANYONE cried at this.\n\nArrrghhh.....\n\nSo. ET, as you know, focuses on a homesick alien who make friends with an extremely annoying kid. Then they have to avoid some shitty government agents and blah blah blah.\n\nIt is hard to believe the great Steven Spielberg launched the far superior Raiders of The Lost Ark a year earlier. \n\nMy main problem with this movie is the sentimentality. Sure, idiotic people will say \"You have no heart\" ect, but I admit I am a cynical person. But a least other sentimental/sappy kids movies are only in that particular mood for a while. Then they switch moods drastically.\n\nET is sappy for most of its time. And, ughhhh that tear jerking nonsense.... I HATE IT!!\n\nThe acting is not very good. Spielberg wanted the acting to be emotional. But in this case, it is too emotional. And that basically drags the movie down.\n\nSpielberg has made far better movies about UFO's in the past ( Close Encounters of the Third Kind) and far, far better movies overall. Too bad this one had to pride itself on tearjerker type nonsense. Spielberg ,\nyou can do better than this. \nET shows what is wrong with cinema. Children's films always have this tear-jerking nonsense, and I understand that it may have worked in 1982, but today? It is ludicrous people are still seduced to this.\n\nThere are some good things about this film. The look of the alien, ET has fared decently over the years, (I should note I saw the 1982 version, not the lame-ass walkie talkie one), and it works an a providing a depiction of a kids childhood. \nBut it is let down by bland acting and tear jerking bullshit.\n\nFinal score for ET: The Anus of Cinema: 1/10 stars.\n\nOne word: Tear jerking junk. Why did Spielberg resort to that? The movie is a bland, boring, needlessly sappy film, that did NOT make me cry. Too bad people sing praises of this film while ignoring the far, far, far ,far ,far ,far ,far better Close Encounters of the Third Kind.",

With countless parodies, rip-offs, satirical twists, and parodies/rip-offs of the first three, it took a while before I faced the fact that I did not know what the original alien was like. I faced intelligent life, and honestly, I feel good. Granted, MANY elements were too sentimental, predictable, or inexplicable for my taste. For example, I can't wrap my head around why E.T. went to Earth. His kind was there for, like, two minutes, before they left him on Earth. The twist is simply not a twist, for anyone who watched any children's movie past E.T. And what baffled me the most is how the connection between E.T. and Elliott (Henry Thomas), as sweet as it was, completely obliterated other characters' motives. I am not representative of Spielberg's intended demographic, and once I accepted that, I could admit to myself and those reading this that I liked E.T. as a movie experience. The kids weren't irritating. In fact, I really liked the little sister, surprisingly played by a young Drew Barrymore. E.T.'s relationship with the world amused me as well, in his reaction to TV programs and potato salad. The metaphysical connection that linked E.T.'s brain waves with Elliott's was an interesting idea to explain their attachment towards one another. And yeah, I like it when E.T. speaks and uses his alien magic. I wasn't bored, nor was I surprised. E.T. served as a needed placeholder for a popular children's movie, as Disney was very unreliable at the time. Besides, Spielberg did not succumb to every single trope. The \"bad guy,\" a man from the FBI, was an alien enthusiast who showed great compassion towards Elliott.  Special effects and a John Williams score help too. I liked E.T.'s anthropomorphic, but surely out-of-this-world, frail design and bone-stretching animation. Overall, this is way too difficult to shoot down from a bike in the sky. Only the most cynical people will not be able to stomach any part of E.T., but getting past familiar story elements and directorial techniques, I believe that the film offers a good, heartwarming time.",

The characters, from the little girl to Elliot, to E.T. himself are all very lovable. The plot sounds childish at first, and might have come off as silly or otherwise under a different director. It is a simple and lovable portrayel of youth, and humorous where it should be. Coming back to what I opened with, CGI was not used or needed for E.T. himself (or herself? Debatable.) You can definitely see Spielburg's hand in the camera composition and reaction shots. The actual E.T. creature isn't always directly shown, so for some expecting creature, prepare to be dissapointed and asking \"Where's the alien?\" because Spielburg films are supposed to create mystery for later on (and in trailers.) John Williams proves he's the very best at scoring movies, like no one ever was. It could have been generic, but he went all out, using a powerful score to inspire awe and emotion. For a children oriented movie, it's very well written, with fine use of symbolism and foreshadowing. Many movies lose relevance quickly, but land marks and emotional drama like E.T. live on in the hearts of many.",

In my opinion he was singularly capable of bringing these two seemingly opposing themes, and make you believe and care about it.\n\nThe young cast are great, especially Henry Thomas, and Drew Barrymore. The score by John William's is legendary, and the visual effects still hold up well decades after the films initial theatrical release. Even the alien 'animatronics' still hold up well, and I would argue work better and look more authentic than the added CGI effects that were included in the 2002 re-release.",

            "content": "I do not think that I have ever fully seen E.T. the Extra Terrestrial before today, today was the first time I watched the entire movie beginning to end. And boy was I wrong about the movie. I thought that it was going to be boring and bad technologically. A few minutes into the movie it gets pretty funny and entertaining. You really feel like you are part of the story and part of the family.\n\tFor those of you who do not know what an extra-terrestrial is, it is an alien. The movie is about an alien who is accidentally left behind on a bizarre planet known to us as planet Earth. Although he is scared he is found by a boy named Elliot (Henry Thomas). Henry slowly introduces E.T. to his siblings, but does not allow them to mention E.T.'s existence to anyone.  His older brother Michael (Robert MacNaughton) and younger sister Gertie (Drew Barrymore) assist him in taking care of E.T. in the meantime until he figures out how to contact his home planet. In the process E.T. and Elliot somehow become one with each other, meaning that when one does something or thinks of doing something the other does it, which can become problematic in the future.\n\tThe story itself is incredible and really draws you in. I personally felt a connection to E.T. while watching the movie. E.T. is such a loveable character and really makes me feel good. I actually want an E.T. for myself.  E.T. has a few awesome and helpful powers, two of which stuck out the most, they are telekinesis and healing. \n\tAnyone who has heard of or has been to Universal Studios knows about the world famous seen where Elliot and E.T. fly at night. Actually watching that scene for the first time in about 10 years (give or take) was overwhelming. I cannot remember actually watching that scene; I remember just seeing them fly past the moon.\n\t Even though this movie was shot in 1982, it looked as if it was recently. The technology used in the movie made everything seem so realistic. When they zoomed in on E.T. he looked real, and according to Cinefex.com, they had a few different E.T.'s, but mainly used three of them. Those three had electrical and mechanical components. They used these three for specific scenes.\n\tAll in all this is a marvelous movie that I highly recommend watching. It is a classic film that every new generation needs to watch at least once. And people who were born before the newer generation need to watch it once if they have not yet seen it. This is a movie that just about every age group could watch. It is definitely a family movie and should be watched with your family, friends, or both.",

Speak of the characters, Elliot and ET make good friends, but only because Elliot is treated so horribly by the other kids (who are more like assholes than in real life).

'The Alien was scripted by Ray himself and was to be produced by Columbia Pictures. Ray was cheated by his own representative in Hollywood, Mike Wilson or something like that, when he obtained the copyright for the film claiming himself as one of the co-writers with him actually having no part in the story at all. The law suits made the lead actors to drop out of the project and a depressed Sathyajit Ray left home to India after the project was canned, but the copies of his script was available all over Hollywood. Spielberg who was out of his college or school during 1965 caught an interest on the picture and later on used it when he became successful.It was actually a story about a spaceship that landed on West Bengal(India)..., a friendly Alien...., the illiterate people considered the ship to be a temple...( I m glad that this film was not made because I think that it is poor to make an English film in India,because when you do an English film in India, the standards become low, you can consider that I think of low my country  here), the Alien's life and friendship with an autistic boy whom he cures to normal health....and so on. However Ray's script was made into an Indian film, 'Koi Mil Gaya' (2003, a Hindi film, not my language). Even people like Martin Scorsese found the similarities and mentioned it in public. You can find more information about 'The Alien' if you checked for ET in Wikipedia. People even say that The Close encounters of ... was also an inspiration from 'The Alien'. \r\n\r\nNow about the film ET\r\n ET is in fact a great film with good visuals and a good story. Spielberg directs this film well. There are lots of melodrama here and there, but you can excuse all of that. The acting overall was good, but I found Henry Thomas' voice really irritating because it shrilled more than an avg woman's voice.",

However the secret gets out and the government takes E.T. away. Elliot feels helpless as he slowly sees E.T. begin to die. However, miraculously he is revived again and Elliot with his brother and friends make a break with E.T. When it looks as if they will be caught their bikes take off allowing the peaceful extraterrestrial to escape and head home. This is one of Speilberg's classics and it is a good historical image of life back in the 1980s aside from the alien.",

Here a classic blockbuster movie from the area of blockbuster movies that defined modern film making that was directed by a legend and it only gets 65%. \n\nSorry modern viewers if ET didn't pop a cap in some homies-ass and then do his porn star woman cuz he's hard like a felon.\n\nOh, i see too. There are elitists rating this film too who didn't lie the mass appeal factor to it, because it should have been some deep and meaningful art house bore-fest we could hob nob over smokes and expensive coffee about.

It's fun, charming, touching and always puts a smile on my face.  It puts a nice spin on the boy and his friend story.  There are quite a few classic scenes but of course the most famous is the flying bike ride.  There's a ton of product placement here, but it did wonders for Reese's Pieces.  I also loved all the Star Wars references and there's even a Tink mention!   While it can sometimes be cheesy, like the evil astronauts and a scary man with keys on his belt but it's all part in the fun.  Director Steven Spielberg does a great job as normal and this is one of his best.  Good performances by the cast including Henry Thomas as Elliot, the young boy who takes care of E.T., Dee Wallace as Elliot's Mom, Mary, Peter Coyote as Keys, Robert MacNaughton as Michael, Elliot's older brother and a very young Drew Barrymore in her first screen role as Gertie, Elliot's sister.  E.T. himself is the cutest alien in history and if you don't love the character you better check your pulse.  On a side note..Universal Studios Florida..don't replace this ride too!  E.T. is one of my favorite family films and should be loved by audiences of all ages for many years to come.\r\n\r\nGets A-List Rating of: A-List Approved!\r\n\r\nYoutube: youtube.com/Wesida515 \r\nFacebook: facebook.com/Westroopalist \r\nTwitter: @WesAlist",

Thier relationship feels so real and endearing that by the end of this movie, you can't help but shed a tear.

The adventures they share as Elliot tries to hide his new friend and E.T. tries to get back to his planet provide plenty of action, laughter and tears.\r\n\r\nIf one were to look for the perfect double-bill among Steven Spielberg's now vast filmography, it would be easy and rather tempting to couple either Close Encounters of The Third Kind or The Extra-Terrestrial with his later work War of The Worlds.  Each seem to be great foils of their peculiar subjects, Close Encounters and E.T. feature nice and bubbly Aliens contrasted with War of The Worlds' cold, killer aliens.  But the real winning foil is between Close Encounters and E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial.\r\n\r\nWhere as Close Encounters' genius is found within a very concrete message of innocence lost among adulthood, E.T. seemingly forgoes the impersonality of a structured message for the simple unadulterated excitement, and innocence of life seen through the lenses of children themselves.  In short, the film is about nostalgia for childhood more-so than any bookish idea.  It's the conceptual opposed to Close Encounters' literary.\r\n\r\nAnd just incase all that bullshit that just escaped my fingers and succeeded in making it onto the RT website in the form of an amateur review, think about this.  Despite all the sentimentality, dated special effects, and sloppy script development; I am willing to bet you laughed, cried and stood in just as much jaw slacked wonderment on the 5th viewing as you did your first whether you want to admit it or not.  \r\n\r\nBut perhaps the biggest praise and ultimate proof of the film's greatness can be found in the fact that when I think of E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial, I think of MY childhood.",

E.T. is so touching that's impossible to don't fell in love with. You forget that E.T. is just a mechanic puppet, you just admire his toughts and emotions. E.T. is a landmark, this is a family masterpiece.",
