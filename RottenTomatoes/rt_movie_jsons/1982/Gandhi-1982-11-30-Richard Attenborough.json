    "summary": "This acclaimed biographical drama presents major events in the life of Mohandas Gandhi (Ben Kingsley), the beloved Indian leader who stood against British rule over his country. Dedicated to the concept of nonviolent resistance, Gandhi is initially dismissed by English officials, including the influential Lord Irwin (John Gielgud), but eventually he and his cause become internationally renowned, and his gatherings of passive protest move India towards independence.",

The acting especially by Kingsley is incredible for 3 hours you become so invested in his character because of how humble, charming and riveting his character is. The dialogue is so sharp and witty  as well. The cinematography is incredible with epic wide shots filled with depth and breathtaking vistas and detailed well framed intimate moments. The music is Good but I would say this was the weakest point as it is very sparingly used and not exactly catchy but memorable and when used it was used well. The editing & pacing were both incredible. This movie has such a razor sharp focus and narrative never feeling like any scene is a waste of time or pointless and never going on too long which was shocking. Filled with funny moments, powerful moments and heartbreaking moments and inspiring feelings of hope, awe and respect throughout 3 Hours. This is a film everyone should try once.",

Its certainly thought provoking and it made me feel ashamed of how Britons treated the Indian people at the time of British rule over the Raj in India, in the early to mid 20th century. Some of the dialogue is quite chilling but I'm pleased to say that the violence depicted isn't what I'd think of as unnecessarily gory and so it doesn't in any way promote or glamorise bloody violence, thankfully.\n\nIts a long watch at around about the 3 hour mark but its worth a watch for the thorough depiction of Britains involvement in India and the way Gandhi attempted to stand up for his people in non violent ways, which is certainly admirable.\n\nIts about standing up for yourself and your people and demonstrating that there are indeed other ways of doing things, ways that may not be acknowledged by those who loom over you and dictate things to yourself but ways that can have their own effectiveness in time. Surely Gandhi is someone worth respecting for his methods and indeed Ben Kingsley does well portraying this revered person. I think if I had to use a phrase to describe the message of this film, it'd be 'the power of peace'. Indeed, there are few such films made nowadays that have remarkably little in the way of violence, sadly.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this film.",

            "content": "Watching this right after Imitation Game was interesting, as they're two biopics on opposite ends of a spectrum. The Turing biopic frustrated the viewer by having people get in the way of his progress; Gandhi excludes all of the negative aspects of the subject's life and just shows a long string of successes for him. It also shows the difference between a good lead performance and a fantastic one as Kingsley was relatively inexperienced and yet really seemed to transform himself into his character whereas Cumberbatch treated Turing like an extension of his own personality. I actually liked that the movie ran for over 3 hours as I really didn't know much about the subject before watching it and, somewhat embarrassingly, I didn't know that Pakistan had once been a part of India! I also hadn't known that Gandhi had been a lawyer or had spent any time in South Africa. On the other hand, if compared to another biopic with a happy ending (Eri Brockovich) there's a pretty big gap in entertainment value here. This came off very much like a movie a classroom would put on for its students and not one that many would go see in theaters. I'm glad to have seen it!",

And I like Richard Attenborough, I think not only was he a talented actor and director but his films are very interesting. Gandhi is certainly one of his more interesting films, along with the underrated Cry Freedom.\n\nGandhi is just a wonderful film, and do I think it's one of Attenborough's best? Along with Cry Freedom and Shadowlands, yes it is. This film is for me his most ambitious and his most stately, and it is very compelling. True, it is long and perhaps leisurely in pace, but it is well worth the watch for several reasons.\n\nVisually it is superb to look at. It was almost like watching a David Lean film, it has the beautiful scenery, the stunning cinematography and the sweeping colours that a Lean film does. I also loved George Fenton's score, it was very epic and moving. Is it his best? Perhaps not, but it is one of his better scores. Attenborough's direction is superb, and the script is thought-provoking. The story, starting with Gandhi's assassination and told mostly in flashback, is interesting and compelling, while the acting also helps drives the film. Words cannot describe how good Ben Kingsley's performance was, composed yet inspirational, sometimes I felt as thought I was actually seeing Gandhi rather than Kingsley. In fact, this is probably the Richard Attenborough-directed film that feels the most authentic in terms of characters and story. Kingsley also gets superb support from Candice Bergen, Edward Fox, John Gielgud and Roshan Seth. Best scene? Lots to pick, but Gandhi's funeral was brilliantly done and one of the most emotional scenes in film and had massive scope to it.\n\nOverall, brilliant and one of Attenborough's best. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

You see him young, wearing a turban but otherwise a regular suit and tie, and he encounters racism when he is thrown off a train for illegally being an a first class compartment when he is an Indian. Then he leads a struggle against racism in South Africa, winning some success before moving to India, which he says (in the movie) is a strange country to him. He would fight against British colonial rule of India, but then realizes that ending it might only lead to a government of Indians who would be just as bad-and then he adopts his famous white Indian clothing. After that, the movie falters, and we see less about Gandhi than the political events that follow, not delivered with great accuracy.\n\nBen Kingsley delivers a perfect performance, looking and acting the part. But the image of Gandhi is completely idealized, and he never gets angry or otherwise seems like a real human being. Indeed, there were things about the historical Gandhi that would appall most people. But this is a movie to entertain, not teach.",

This one depicts the life of Mohandas Gandhi (Ben Kingsley) leader of the non-violent rebellion against the British Empire. During which, he is greeted with racial prejudice, numerous prison sentences, closing of desalination farms, betrayal of old political friends, fastings during a violent Pakistani riot, and ultimately an assassination. Much like Patton, where Gandhi gets right is how much it gets right about the Anti-imperialist protests, South African apartheid protests, Gandhi's progressive accent change, and even his utter of the last words, \"Oh, god,\" with very little made up. I also love how majestically shot Gandhi is. Richard Attenborough was clearly channeling David Lean's masterpiece Lawrence of Arabia with giant rural landscapes, grand architecture, and a huge cast of extras grouped together in extreme wide shots. There's also cameos from Candice Bergen, Martin Sheen, Daniel Day-Lewis, Chariots of Fire's Ian Charleson, John Gielgud and Richard Griffiths, who are slightly distracting, but they play their parts really well. However, the strangest of appearances is John Ratzenberger as the photographer's driver. When I saw his name on the cast list and him in the movie, I didn't recognize him at first, mainly due to his voice change. For me, Gandhi was a great film with a great scope full of great performances as well as a great movie to show to World History high school students. \n\n(4 \u00bd Cliff Clavin Cameos out of 5)",

This biography movie follows the life of Mahatma Gandhi as he transitions from lawyer to political leader to spiritual luminary, working to liberate India from British rule.  This journey spans from 1893 through his assassination in 1948.\n\nThis film transports you so eloquently to different regions of the Middle East and to an era when the native Indian people are forced into a second class citizenship and servitude by the ruling British government.  The cinematography is sublime, showing off the lavish opulence of the British residences and offices as opposed to the squalor and simplicity of the towns and residences of the native people.  \n\nBen Kingsley plays the title character superbly with charm, calm and an ever spectacular glint of higher wisdom.  Filmed before the availability of CGI, the make-up team does an outstanding job of aging Kingsley from mid-twenties through late seventies.   Kingsley carries this film completely on his capable shoulders, being supported here and there by Martin Sheen, Trevor Howard, Sir John Gielgud, Candice Bergen, Ian Charleson and most intimately by Rohini Hattangadi as his dutiful and loving wife, Kasturba.  \n\nThis film runs the emotional gamut, constantly tugging to ensure your viewing experience is a fully satisfied one.  It's a big tale that never gets lost or sidetracked, and the editing is perfection.  In fact, the movie has the honor of being in the Guinness Book of Records for the most extras used in a film\u2026 there were roughly 300,000 of them used in a funeral scene!

It is a way of life that Gandhi believed in till his end and it is clear that actor/director Sir Richard Attenborough had all the good intentions and passions to brings Gandhi's story to the screen in a big way. To some viewers' dismay, this movie runs just about 3 hours long and, much like the humble figure it depicts, moves at a leisurely but steady pace; it chronicles Gandhi's fight for his countries independence in a very honest if not quite thorough way. I can't say Attenborough and his team of filmmakers were all too adventurous with the historical material as this often feels like a conventional biography-pic. The cinematography looks competent and gorgeously natural (the new 4k scan makes most of the film look like it was shot recently!!) but at the same time looks rather bland and uninspired. Luckily, the movie finds its majesty through its production authenticity, convincing scenes of crowd control and the complete commitment of its lead actor. Ben Kingsley makes an epic movie debut about the same way that Peter O'Toole did in \"Lawrence of Arabia\" and is truly outstanding. Not only does he look just like the man but he embodies his voice, cadence and spirit while we watch him physically transform before our eyes. It is this performance alone that makes this worth a watch. - 8/10 (B+)",

Its a long movie and it does justice to the great man. There a few historical inaccuracies but we learn so much about a man who empowered a nation.   There are many memorable scenes and the first 10 minutes including an assassination, being kicked from a train to the burning of passes starts the film off nicely. The assassination asks questions like why was he popular to why was he killed. The amount of the people at his funeral show the upmost respect that he was given. He was a clever man as a lawyer and used what he knew very well, how being arrested helped his cause and that non violent made the British look bad when they were violent. Rohini Hattangadi  is excellent as Gandhi's wife were initial disapproval of Gandhi's action to becoming a fighter alongside him. Ben Kingsley with being small has a presence and is a wonderful speaker. Every speech he makes you want to listen and you believe every word. The British do look really bad throughout the film, they seem too big for their boots and you feel ashamed watching their actions. The massacre is shocking, with people running and not escaping. Its well filmed but nevertheless harrowing. We see the amount of bullets and see the amounts of bodies. The Muslims versus the Hindus is another shocking episode at this time, you can see Gandhi is struggling to understand, feeling that violence again is not the way. This is a gripping episode in Indian and Pakistan history. Much praise should be for the use of the locations, the music and the production. We notice Gandhi getting older through excellent make up and we the early 20th century vividly shot. A powerful biopic with a well written script and a supporting cast that does an excellent job.

            "content": "Critics of Richard Attenborough's award winning 1982 historical biography Gandhi \u2013 and there are some \u2013 have dismissed the film as a hagiography. Several historians of varying degrees of credibility have cast doubt on whether Gandhi was quite the saint that he is depicted as here, which throws into question the historical accuracy of the movie. Whether there is justification for these claims however, they do not detract from Gandhi's quality as a piece of filmmaking.\nThe story follows Gandhi from a fateful experience of racial prejudice on an a train in South Africa, as he campaigns first for the equal rights of all citizens of the British Empire regardless of the colour of their skin, and then for an independent India free of British Colonial Rule. Despite criticisms of the film for deifying Gandhi, screenwriter John Briley largely (and wisely) lets the audience get to know him as a man rather than a saint, subject to hopes and disappointments, errors of judgement and occasional arguments with his wife. The plot opens with Gandhi's assassination, before showing us in chronological order how he got to that point and Briley's depiction of his experiences and motivations is entirely convincing within the narrative of the film.\nIndeed, Gandhi is very well written. All of its many characters \u2013 most of them based on real people \u2013 are believable, even if they only appear briefly. In a story that often explores human nature at its best and worst, Briley generally avoids stereotyping anyone, with many of the characters capable of acts of cruelty however well-meaning that might be (Gandhi of course, is the exception to this rule), but all more complicated than simply good or evil. Thus, we get racist white South African thug Colin (played by a young Daniel Day-Lewis), whose attempts to intimidate Gandhi are rather spoiled when his mother chastises him, and the Hindu man who confesses to Gandhi that he is going to hell for killing a child, prompting Gandhi to tell him to pay penance by finding an orphaned Muslim boy and raising him in the child's own faith.\nIt is of course the acting that brings these characters to life. Ben Kingsley famously won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Gandhi, and his performance is remarkably convincing throughout, at all stages of Gandhi's life. Kingsley's textured, passionate performance keeps Gandhi human, especially during the more personal moments, for example when Gandhi's wife dies, and when he realises with horror that whilst India may have gained independence, he can't stop Partition. But the large supporting cast also deserves a great deal of credit for the success of the film, with naturalistic performances by Rohini Hattangadi as Kasturba Gandhi, Virenda Razdan as Maulana Azad, Sir John Gielgud as Baron Irwin, Martin Sheen as Vince Walker and Roshan Seth as Jawaharlal Nehru (India's first Prime Minister), to name but a few.\nRichard Attenborough was never a showy director, and his simple but elegant approach is well suited to large-scale historical epics of this nature, letting the story and the characters speak for themselves. He pulls no punches in depicting the injustices of the British Empire's rule, both in South Africa and India. Whilst no blood is seen on screen, the unflinching depiction of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre and Brigadier General Reginald Dyer's complete lack of repentance is shocking. The subsequent brutal rioting by the Indians is also depicted unflinchingly, as is the scene of Gandhi's followers quietly walking into the clubs of those sent to stop them, and also the chaos and violence that followed Partition. \nGreat care is taken over the sets, costumes and props and the huge number of extras recruited for the film \u2013 especially during Gandhi's funeral \u2013 enhances the sense of scale. So does the cinematography: Billy Williams and Ronnie Taylor's frequent use of wide angled, deep-focused shots show off the locations nicely. The later recreation of black and white newsreel footage to demonstrate reports of Gandhi's visit to England is also a nice touch, rooting the story in its historical context. The film's soundtrack by Ravi Shankar and George Fenton nicely reflects the Indian setting.\nA study of the background of the film's production makes it obvious that Gandhi was a labour of love for Richard Attenborough, and this is apparent throughout every minute of its screen time. Accusations of historical inaccuracy or misrepresentation of its title character may well be valid, but they don't make the film any less impressive.",

            "content": "For the first ninety minutes I was watching this film I was surprised how engaged I was and it was so much less boring than everybody had told me. For the next two hours the film was unfocused and languished on areas of Gandhi's life that held absolutely no interest. This is a waste of your time as a production, there is absolutely no reason to watch Candice Bergen appear as Margaret Bourke-White for seemingly no reason, and the fact that Blade Runner (1982) was released in the same year shows what a joke the Best Picture category was in 1982. I really wanted to appreciate this film but I found myself hating it as much as ever regular movie-goer does.\n\nMohandas Gandhi, Ben Kingsley, is inspired to become a revolutionary after being kicked off a bus by racist passengers and operators in South Africa. He establishes a committee to fight for racial tolerance and equal treatment while advocating non-violent protest. After he convinces the South African government to adjust their laws to be more tolerant of Indians he returns to India and although initially resistant to the idea he decides to lead the fight for Indian independence from the British Empire. He manages to attract international press to cover his cause and is successfully able to pressure the British government into granting the nation freedom after the Second World War. Awkwardly placed in between major events are his conflicts with his wife Kasturba, Rohini Kattangadi, his adoption of a British girl Madeleine Slade, Geraldine James, and the appearance of famed photojournalist Margaret Bourke-White, Candice Bergen.\n\nWhat I appreciated about the film was the performance of Ben Kingsley, the production values and the cinematography. Kingsley manages to humanize Gandhi even while he works around a difficult screenplay. He injects some humor and empathy into his character instead of portraying him as the stoic, unfailingly noble figure that appears in pop culture. He was deserving of the Best Actor award and I only wish that he had a better film surrounding his great performance. The production values were not on the level of a Victor Fleming production but they were still impressive as an epic should be as we get sweeping shots of period accurate splendor and restaging of large historical gatherings. Finally, Billy Williams and Ronnie Taylor are able to capture the beautiful parts of India, particularly during a sequence in which Gandhi witnesses workers in the field during his homecoming, which is a pleasant sight but they are not able to film much else.\n\nRichard Attenborough seemed like a perfectly kind man and I believe that he had nothing but good intentions in making this film he is one of my least favorite directors. Much like Cry Freedom (1987) we see an important historical figure through a British man's eyes and although I understand that may be Attenborough's own perspective it is condescending to both Mohandas Gandhi and Steve Biko to have films made about them that portray them needing the help of white saviors. Although Cry Freedom was much worse in this film we still get multiple white saviors as for a majority of the time Gandhi appears on screen he is accompanied by a good white person who did more for the cause than the Indians themselves. The white savior trope is terrible and Attenborough is very fond of using it, just one of his many faults as a storyteller.\n\nThe way the film approaches the character of Gandhi himself is to show him as a saintly figure without giving him any real personality and complexity and cutting out all of the hard edges that made him interesting. John Briley's screenplay works to spell out everything for the audience, rush through 55 years of history and not focus on any one thing for long enough to make us care. The combination of the screenwriting and direction leaves us with a main character who we cannot identify with or even understand why he carries out his actions, that is the sign of a poorly executed biopic.\n\nAt three and a quarter hours and containing all of the awful elements I have listed this is an overly long mess that nobody should have to watch. I am sure there are great novels and documentaries out there that delve into the inner life of Gandhi and explain the motivations for his actions better than this film. Of the 1982 Best Picture nominees I believe E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) is the most deserving of winning the award.",

            "content": "A labour of love in its every frame, and a symbol of adoration for India and its people, Gandhi is, as many have remarked, over long and tedious in places, but breezy and compelling in others. Ben Kinglsey is perfectly cast in the lead role, not just because he bears a striking resemblance to the late peacemaker, but because he does everything in his power to embody what the man meant to his nation, and indeed to the world. His peaceful resistance, his determination in the face of insurmountable odds, his willingness to starve himself to near-death for the unity of his country, all of it comes through in his performance. The film is certainly guilty, as many biopics are, of portraying its star in an overly generous light. Nothing is mentioned of his voracious sexual appetites, and pivotal instances, such as him being thrown out of a first-class train carriage in South Africa, are fabrications used to propel both the story and its message. It might not be entirely true, but everything is presented on such an incredible scale that you do feel the weight of an entire country and the burden it's bearing, and you want Gandhi to succeed above all else. The Brits occupying the country are often portrayed as one-dimensional snobs who looks down on their subjects, but many are given reasonable motivations, and punishments are handed out for those who overstep their bounds. As a 3-hour movie, there's others I would sooner watch again, such as The Return Of The King or The Green Mile, which I feel make better use of their runtime. But Gandhi beautifully and thoroughly portrays a seminal period in the world's history, and does it with beauty, tragedy, and above all, hope.",

The movie was directed by Richard Attenborough but Ben Kingsley played the iconic role of Mohandas Gandhi and he delivered an astounding performance, one that truly places the film in a level of its own. This movie is relatable to what we are doing in our religion class because of how prominent an individual Gandhi was in the Hindu religion, one that we covered intensely for Week Five of this semester. \n\tThis movie is almost like a documentary because of how the viewer is merely an observer into the life of Gandhi and it is very different how this movie started out the introduction at the assassination of Gandhi, one that rarely happens in movies that would rather wait to buildup character development to this untimely point. The movie follows the life of Gandhi and how his use of peaceful protests led to the successful partition of India and forced the British people to retreat back to their country. One part in the movie that was particularly interesting to me was the part where Indian citizens gathered in Amritsar to peacefully protest an unfair rule in the town regarding curfew and eventually a British general named Reginald Dyer heard about this protest and sent his troops into the gardens. Although the protest was a peaceful one, Dyer maintained that the protestors did not heed his warning and now he ordered his troops to open fire leading to the deaths of thousands including women and children. This scene is one of the most pivotal ones in the whole movie because it shows us why Gandhi had to do what he did in his protests because of the unjust rulings of the British.",

Gandhi the film triumphs for depicting Gandhi's struggle for this cause. Gandhi is a fairly comprehensive look at the late 1800's and early 1900's Indian political climate. In watching Gandhi, you will, undoubtedly, gain historical knowledge and social perspective of the time period.\n\nMusically, Attenborough enlisted the greatest sitar player of all time, Ravi Shankar, to score Gandi. His beautiful and emotional sitar ragas are a delight to hear throughout the movie. Shankar's scoring is a boon to the film's authenticity and atmosphere alike. I love how Shankar fills the empty air with sweet and endearing Indian classical music played on his steadfast sitar. Shankar's score is the perfect complement to Gandhi's visuals.\n\nFurthermore, the cast, cinematography, score, and direction all yield stellar results for Gandhi. It is as classic as any biopic that has ever been filmed. All the praise for Kingsley is well earned.",

Even though the story is not a unfamiliar one, the film makes effective work of it and makes every minute of the three hour run time meaningful. Despite my fears of this being a long and overdrawn film, this felt deliberate in every scene to keep the audience interested and not just cram some scenes with filler material by wisely staying away from showing Gandhi in prison very often. Finally, Kingsley gives his best performance ever, and completely disappears into his role, he is incredibly subdued but manages to creep into every scene as the most powerful force without feeling like he is anything other than a quiet man that wants peace and freedom.

This movie is the autobiography of Gandhi and what he accomplished and how. The movie starts and the end with his murder being shot point blank at a large rally by Nathuram Godse. Then it flashes back to when he was a young man in South Africa. He is a young attorney at the time and goes to ride a train with his first-class pass. He is told he is not allowed to ride first class. He refused this order and demands to ride first class. He is then thrown off the train. This is his turning point realize that nonviolence is the way and that treating minorities like this is unacceptable. The majority of the movie after this is him preforming nonviolent protest against South Africa and in Indian. He establishes equality in south Africa and then moves back to his home country of Indian. Here he does similar protest and even goes on a hungry strike to cease the Britain rule over their country. During these protest, he is jailed many times and beaten. There is tragic scene in Indiana where women and children and mean are gun down for about five minutes over the Hindus and Muslins struggles. \n\tThis movie has extreme religions ties and connect. Where most people say, Gandhi was Jainism due to all his closer friends where he was more of a Ahimsa (doing no harm) which is one the biggest part of Jainism. This movie you get to see many practices of Jainism from the medication and the giving away of all material goods. The act of selflessness you could say to some it all up. Gandhi was strong believer and doing no harm and being selflessness that he would sacrifice all his goods and himself. He would starve himself to show he dedication to prove what is right.",

Just one example of the latter was his very na\u00efve attitude towards Hitler, which I chalk up to the limits of his idealism more than anything else, not evil on his part - but that would have been 'fair ground' for a more accurate and balanced portrayal of the man.  However, I have to say, those who focus on these omissions miss all that was absolutely accurate - and truly inspiring - in the film.  \n\nThis epic movie has beautiful shots of India and is beautiful in spirit.  Who can possibly not be moved by this great man, whose simplicity and nonviolent approach to oppression and violence inspired Indians and the world?   He endures beatings without raising a hand, and his moral rectitude and dignity never waver in dealing with the British, his countrymen, and his peers in the 'Home Rule' movement.   He eschews pomp, embraces poverty, and demands authenticity.   In testifying in his own defense while on trial, he says simply \"Non-cooperation with evil is a duty, and that British rule of India is evil.\"   In speaking with British officials, he says \"In the end you will walk out, because 100,000 Englishmen simply cannot control 350 million Indians, if those Indians refuse to cooperate - and that's what we intend to achieve - peaceful, nonviolent, non-cooperation, until you yourselves see the wisdom of leaving.\"   He tries desperately to hold Hindus and Muslims together in the aftermath, but is frail and then is of course assassinated.\n\nPerhaps the most difficult to watch or even fathom is the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar, which Attenborough shows us right before the intermission.  The brutality and cruelty of British Colonel Reginald Dyer is staggering, as was his callousness in the inquiries afterwards - and there is no exaggeration in the film.  \n\nThere are aspects that can be questioned about the film - why a white man was hired to play the part of Gandhi (even though Kingsley is fantastic), why Jinnah was portrayed in too negative a light (possibly due to the influence of the Indian government, who helped sponsor the film), and why Gandhi was overly idealized.   It's not perfect, and neither was he.  However, the truth is that the man was courageous, enlightened, and an awe-inspiring moral beacon to us all.  His words were beautiful - and the film gets all of this right.  For companion reading, try 'Mohandas Gandhi Essential Writings', which has a number of fantastic passages, and provides a more complete view of the man.  \n\nIn the meantime, I highly recommend this movie.   Just one more quote, in his speech in front of a packed house, which threatens to become violent in the face of unfair new British Laws:\n\n\"In this cause, I too am prepared to die; but my friends, there is no cause for which I am prepared to kill.  Whatever they do to us, we will attack no one, kill no one, but we will not give our fingerprints, not one of us.  They will imprison us, they will fine us, they will seize our possessions, but they cannot take away our self-respect if we will not give it to them. ... I am asking you to fight.  To fight against their anger, not to provoke it.  We will not strike a blow, but we will receive them, and through our pain, we will make them see their injustice, and it will hurt, as all fighting hurts.  But we cannot lose.  We cannot.  They may torture my body, break my bones, even kill me - then, they will have my dead body - not my obedience.\"\n\nHallelujah.",

But segregation in South Africa wasn't the only conflict Gandhi had to deal with, Muslims and Hindus were also having problems in India, the British were taking rights from the Indians by oppressing them, and they were also making them pay unnecessary taxes. He then decided to move back to India and take care of the issue. Gandhi had to come up with a way to resolve the conflicts in India. With the help of Nehru and Jinnah, he came up with the idea to lead peaceful protests in India and also show photographs to the world so that other countries would be aware of the conflicts. Islam and Hinduism were also arguing over who had more power. They taught that the ideas to resolve the conflict between the major religious groups was to split India into two sections. Pakistan was divided from India for the Muslims and India was for the Hindus. Gandhi was still skeptical about the idea because he wanted for the two groups to be united but instead they were divided. He always opt for the peace in the country by uniting all religions but it was unsuccessful. A few moment after this event, Gandhi was killed.",

His goal is Freedom for him and his people no matter the cost.  It is tale of good vs evil.  Who will triumph?   \n\tThis is a movie of inspiration and one that will leave you looking in the mirror questioning your own morals and values. It is an autobiographical movie of Mohandas Gandhi.  The movie Gandhi starts in reverse.  It shows Gandhi as an elderly man in New Delhi India being executed in front of a large crowd of followers by what appears to be a young man of Indian accent.  Then the movie goes back in time to 1893 in Southern Africa where we see a Gandhi as a young attorney.  He sees what he calls injustice laws against Hindus, Muslims and other minorities and he begins to protest by burning the British passages or laws.  The British police officers proceed to beat him with canes until he passes out and is later put in prison.  The word spreads quickly of Gandhi and his non-violent protest.   His believe is that, like Christ, you must be willing to take on violence without violence then the angry toward them decreases.  This becomes the underlining theme of the movie.  \n\tOnce the non-violence movement was started in South Africa Gandhi went back to his home country of India in 1915.  This is where he tried to unite his people against the British rule and led many non-violent protest to gain their freedom.  Over 1500 Indians were killed at the hands of the British armies.  After going to prison and court many times Gandhi finally led his people to Freedom, but the ones who united with him started a civil war amongst the Muslims and Hindus, which leads us to the final scene of Gandhi being shot and killed. With his death he created one of the largest religious movements in history.\nThis is my second time watching this movie.  It inspires me and has me look at my own religion in comparison.  Gandhi was not just a Hindu but a God follower who accepted all religions.  His teachings and the way he lived his life can be seen in other religions today.  For example in Christianity we also teach that Jesus (God) was a believer of non-violence all the way to his death.  It also speaks of fasting and pray to come closer to God and other Christians.  Gandhi used pray and fasting in the same way.  Gandhi lived as a minimalist.  He made his own clothes, grew his own food, helped built villages and anything else he needed.  This is similar to Buddhism, where they do not believe in worshipping material possession, but rather live as beggars.  They believe this will bring them to an enlighten state.  Overall, Gandhi has influenced a variety of people and religions through his movement.",

Gandhi's story is obviously one that needs to be told and remembered - he basically created modern India - but the film is far too slow and drawn-out and skips all over the shop.

Still, it deals with the politics and issues Gandhi (Kingsley) faced in the early 1900s quite well and has a good support cast.

He gets thrown off of the train because of the \"color\" of his skin. This event, that took place, was a catalyst for a non-violent protest in the center of town to burn permits that non-African descents are required to carry and show when police demand for it. During the protest he was repeatedly beat on by the police and eventually falls and was arrested. After his release from jail, Gandhi decided that he should protest against Britain, and expected to have millions of followers. He first protested against the British textile industry but it went terribly wrong. A second protest was in the garden against an unfair town curfew. During this protest, a lot of people were killed. A trial was held against the general that ordered him and his troops to kill those people as well. After World War two, Britain finally had given India Independence. The country of India ended up dividing by religion and Gandhi did not like it. He carried out a hunger strike against the nationwide violence between Hinduism and Muslim cultures. Gandhi is eventually shot and killed out of Anger. \nThe Movie Gandhi relates to \"chapter 4: Hinduism through Dharma\" in our world religion books. As Dharma can be seen as the order that upholds the universe by dictating the duties and obligations of all beings, Gandhi did exactly the same thing, if not something similar. Gandhi upheld Dharma by standing up, not only for his personal rights, but for the moral values and the laws of everyone. Gandhi stood up overall for the country of India. He also upheld the Sadharana Dharma, which is the Dharma of ethical action and engagement in a universal sense.",

But then my friend explains, no, no, it's about Indians from India. So I'm like, OK, I'll give it a try. 30 minutes later, no colorful song-and-dance numbers with exotic women hopping around and guys singing incomprehensible gibberish. So I'm like, f*ck this sh*t. But my friend insists I give the film a chance because it's important, about some scrawny guy who devoted his life to peace. I told him I already survived the Carter Presidency, thank you very much. But then suddenly there's a Bond villain on the screen! And I'm like, Cool! So I ask my friend, Who's the Bond villain? And he's all like, What the hell are you talking about? And I say, The guy in the Nehru jacket, dude; every great Bond villain wears a Nehru jacket. And my friend's all, That's f*ckin' Nehru, man! And I'm like, Nehru who?! And he says, Nehru, man, Jawaharlal \"Pandit\" Nehru, the first prime minister of India. So I'm just like, Whatever. This film is a waste of time; three hours, no less! If Hollywood is going to do a three-hour film on anyone, it would be good if they didn't pick these obscure people as the subjects. And not throw in Bond villains for no reason. Like THAT made any sense. Oh, and that whole hunger strike thing? All the Bond villain had to do was dangle a couple White Castles in front of the guy and that would've ended that. Oh! And then they kill the hero at the end? Hellooooooo. What kind of movie kills the good guy?! This was one long, boring, unrealistic, nonsensical movie. Right up there with \"King of Kings.\"",

I can't imagine how the director was actually able to procure such massive number of people and make them act in his desired manner. You can't picture a man's entire life into a film, but still this film follows all the important aspects and ideals of Gandhi's life. As any Indian, I also knew clearly well about what Gandhi did to help India gain it's independence, but we never knew much about what happened to him post the freedom was obtained, he was of course assassinated. What really surprised me was the story of the film towards the last 30 minutes which told of his life post the independence. Those incidents that happen during that time time are just unimaginably disturbing.

He was then thrown off the train for not moving. I think that was the beginning of   his fight for freedom. There has always been a great leader among us. People are going to be in need of some kind of hope in a land where there is none.  There seems like it's going to be a spiritual leader in our times.

His influence spread threw out his life before his death. Gandhi preached and practiced non-violence his philosophy was simple. In sense he demanded respect for his people and he wanted to achieve it threw non-violence. As the British warned him he also warned them that India would overcome.\nThis movie displays the total discrimination that people have gone through for things that they didn't understand.

Gandhi was born in the western part of British ruled India on October 2, 1989 and was a great Indian political leader who used nonviolent resistance to win the Indian's freedom from the British Empire, and he lived to see that dream split the partition of India and Pakistan. Gandhi was a timid child and he married at thirteen to a girl of the same age. Following the death of his father, Gandhi's family sent him to England in 1888 to study law. While studying law he then became interested in the philosophy of nonviolence. In 1983, Gandhi was thrown off a South African train for being an Indian and traveling in a first class compartment, it was then that he realized that the laws are biased against Indians and he decides to start a non-violent protest campaign for all of the Indians in South Africa. Gandhi is repeatedly jailed and grows increasing frustrated as violence on both sides escalates. He goes on strike after a brutal mass murder of peaceful Indian protestors. The brutality of this scene is when the lieutenant in charge of the act, coldly defends his decision to fire and he keeps firing until over thousands are dead.  The best part of the movie in my opinion was in the middle of the movie there is a small scene that helps the audience understand why Ghandi was so important and him and his wife reenacts their marriage vows.

            "content": "PART OF MY CLASSIC VIEWINGS OF 2014 LIST\n\n\"An eye for an eye just ends up making the whole world blind.\"\n\nEver since he heard of the story of Indian leader Mohandas Gandhi, Richard Attenborough had a dream of making Gandhi into a feature length epic. That dream took 20 years to make, as studios repeatedly turned the project down and when the film was finally made, the studio that eventually made it, Columbia, was skeptical of casting an unknown actor, Ben Kingsley, in the title role. But Attenborough's risks and hard determination paid off tremendously, and Gandhi is an extremely powerful and well-made epic, so strong that you'd think it was made by David Lean.\n\nAfter being thrown off a train in South Africa due to his Indian heritage, British-trained lawyer Mohandas Gandhi (Ben Kingsley) realizes that the British Empire is being unfair to the people they're controlling, particularly those in South Africa and especially the Hindus and Muslims living in India. Wanting to make a difference, Gandhi risks his life to free the Indians from British rule, by means of \"passive resistance\", where he fights for independence using peaceful tactics instead of violence. Thousands fight for Gandhi's independence, but freedom comes at a price, and Gandhi really pays it hard in the 50 years he fought for it.\n\nGandhi features a strong supporting cast, including Candace Bergen, Martin Sheen, John Mills, Trevor Howard, and in a small cameo, a young Daniel Day-Lewis. Everyone involved do great jobs in this film. It was great seeing everyone's reactions to what Gandhi is fighting for and seeing what side they join, Gandhi's or the British.\n\nEarlier I said that David Lean could have made this film. When first looking at Gandhi, you'd think that this film was made by the legendary epic filmmaker, as Gandhi features grand, sweeping cinematography and thousands of extras, more so than any other epic at that time. I bet if I hadn't of known Richard Attenborough made the movie, I would have thought Lean had made this movie. There were portions of this movie that reminded me of Lawrence of Arabia, similar in scope and filled with powerful moments. While Lawrence of Arabia is still the definitive historical epic, Gandhi, at it's own, is still a wonderful film. The cinematography is certainly beautiful for what an epic is supposed to do. Gandhi was filmed on location in India and the United Kingdom, and in every shot, I was amazed at the locations Attenborough used in creating this epic, with the most beautiful being Gandhi traveling through India admiring the scenery and the natives. I was also impressed with shots of natives riding on top of the same train Gandhi was riding in same scene. No wonder why this film won an Oscar for its sweeping cinematography. Also impressive is its score by George Fenton and Ravi Shankhar, one of the most authentic sounding scores I've heard in my life.\n\nBut why is Gandhi such a true essential classic? Well, the biggest reason why is definitely Ben Kingsley's performance as this legendary leader. When I had first heard of this movie, I was skeptical of watching actually, as I thought a movie about the guy who used peaceful measures to free a nation would bore me, as I grew up with nonstop action movies and had no interest in \"true\" epic movies (back then, I viewed films like Clash of the Titans and Prince of Persia as epic films). But thankfully, my tastes in movies have changed, and I was super impressed with this film, especially the reasoning why I didn't want to watch it, Ben Kingsley's performance as the title character. First off, the makeup Kingsley uses in creating Gandhi is likely the most realistic portrayal I've seen in a historic figure. It was great seeing Kingsley play Gandhi over the years, from a young man with hair to an old wise figure without any hair. As for his actual performance, Kingsley moved me in a way unlike any other. As Gandhi, Kingsley reminded me of this important truth in other people, that no matter what religion people believe and what ideas they have, that we all must learn to respect others for what they believe in life and share this world hand in hand. Gandhi surely was a powerful figure in reality, and Ben Kingsley plays him extremely well. There were moments in the film where I thought that Gandhi had come back from the dead, playing himself throughout, especially in sequences where we see his reactions of other's actions, particularly the scene where he learns of the brutal massacre of thousands of innocents, along with the scene where he learns of troubling conflicts between Hindus and Muslims. Ben Kingsley won an Oscar for his portrayal, and definitely deserved his win, and afterwards, he has had a very successful acting career, most recently playing The Mandarin in Iron Man 3. Whether he's The Mandarin or George Meliles in Hugo, Kingsley will always be remembered for his sweeping, realistic portrayal of Mohandas Gandhi.\n\nWith it's wondrously beautiful cinematography, thousands of extras, and Ben Kingsley's remarkable performance as the title character, Gandhi is truly what an epic should be, a film that's exceptionally realistic and emotionally powerful. Richard Attenborough should be congratulated for his hard work at making this wonderful movie, which is why I truly believe it deserved to win Best Picture in the end. The film is over three hours, and even though it can be really difficult to sit through this for some people, I still highly recommend Gandhi for what it set out to do; to inform us about this fantastic leader and give us a grand history lesson. This is biopic at its finest.\n\n\" When I despair, I remember that all through history the way of truth and love has always won. There have been tyrants, and murderers, and for a time they can seem invincible, but in the end they always fall. Think of it. Always.\"",

            "content": "Gandhi Movie Review\n\nOne of the great men of this century would have to be Mohandas K. Gandhi, a little fellow with the biggest heart who refused to give in. His determination to fight prejudice, repression and tyranny took him on a life long journey that humbled the British Empire and established independence for his beloved fellow Indians. Throughout his battle for freedom, Gandhi always obeyed his personal creed of non-violence - for both himself and his at-times hot-headed supporters. Gandhi is an epic, in the true sense of the word, and goes for more than three hours. And yet, while at times it does slow, you are always enticed onwards by Ben Kingsley's stunning display of acting. \nThe guy definitely made himself Gandhi - in look, voice and characteristics - and deservedly won his golden statue for the effort. The movie itself took out eight Oscars, not to mention a horde of other prestigious awards. Gandhi follows the life of the peaceful revolutionary from his journey to South Africa where he discovered that being articulate, intelligent and a trained lawyer cut very little ice with the boorish South African regime. Back in his home country, Gandhi found that the independence movement was split along Hindu/Muslim lines and the poor were despicably treated by those with money. Sir Richard Attenborough clearly was awestruck by Gandhi the man and - together with Kingsley - has turned him into a saint. Perhaps he is portrayed as being just a little too perfect, but you can forgive Attenborough going over the top. After all, how can you not be a tad impressed with a bloke who decides to try to starve himself to death so his supporters will stop committing acts of violence? One of the most telling scenes is where a wild-eyed Hindu confesses to Gandhi he had killed a child by bashing its brains out. Gandhi, weak from lack of food, says he will be forgiven if he takes into his care another child. Only it had to be Muslim and he had to raise it as one. \nThere is no doubt in mind that this movie has a lot to do with our class and the subjects that we cover. We actually talk about Gandhi in our studies so that is one of the main reasons why I selected this movie because I felt that it was something that should be shown. This movie deals with religion, culture different culture movements. It deals with sacrifice and shows different ways that his religion goes about the daily life. You get the opportunity to see another religion from a positive and well respected point of view.",

            "content": "I thoroughly loved watching this film. This films interpretation on Mahatma Gandhi was right on. The movie was about the life of spiritual leader and politician Mahatma Gandhi and his struggle in gaining independence for India from the British government. In my opinion Gandhi was a gentle and fearless man who decided that it would be more prominent to fight the British government with kindness and unity with his country. In the beginning of the film, Gandhi was taking a walk and meeting some of his devotees when he was assassinated by a man in the crowd. After that we see him being thrown off a train because the train directors did not believe that he was an attorney because he was \"black\", even though he was well dressed and provided his documentation to prove it. After a while he was arrested along with his followers, and then they were freed and Indians were granted a few rights. Gandhi made his way back to India and still wanted to continue in fighting against the British government while also promoting his campaign against violence. India gained their independence from the British government after World War II. Mahatma Gandhi's efforts and valor helped India to gain their independence from the British as well as give the people of India a chance to fight and protest for their country and their rights. This film relates to World Religions because it depicts one of the most famous leaders in history that promoted non-violence to gain independence for his country. This sense of tranquility and insight that he probably gained from Hindu and Jain teachings helped him to not react with hatred, nor violence but in a fashion that made it easier for Indians to be heard versus only being thrown in jail like common criminals. Mahatma Gandhi was a clever, witty, fair, humble, intelligent, and spiritual man whose decisions as a man and a spiritual leader led India to independence after World War II. Gandhi died still continuing to fight for the rights of his people as well his promote his campaign for non-violence.",

Gandhi fell from the hands of the Hindus when he could not stop the indescribable violence between India and Pakistan. Gandhi tried to stop the slaughter but the majority Hindus and minority Muslims would not let him.This movie relates to religion because Gandhi's his interest in religious matters was due to the background of India, which was saturated with religious ideas and spirituality Religion was no matter to Gandhi, because he found God within creation. Gandhi referred to God as \"truth\". His mission was not only to humanize religion but to moralize it. His interpretation of religion of Hinduism, Islam, and Christianity made his religion a federation of different religious faiths.

In my opinion, I think people should watch it themselves and would learn from the movie just as much as I did. It has an amazingly well displayed historical significance and Great performances in a near flawless, frank script. It masterfully tells one of the most important stories, of India's struggle to free itself, spearheaded by one of the most extraordinary men of all time, Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi, who created a non violence protest for the rights of all Indians in South Africa; and there were some setbacks of violence against the protesters and Gandhi himself who were imprisonment occasionally. Overall, Britain finally grants India's independence. Still their problems are far from over. A nation wide violence erupts between the two religions Hindus and Muslim. Gandhi starts a hunger strike. The fighting does stop eventually, but the country remains divided. Gandhi was a very religious man and his religion had a lot of impact on him, which was Hindu. The religious message of Gandhi and of the movie. It does not matter what you call God (Allah, Buddha, Brahman, Yahweh, or God) we are all children of Him. He loves us all equally and the same. 3 Hindu beliefs that played a crucial role in shaping Gandhi's life is Non-violence (Ahimsa) for over thousands of years, non violence was considered the highest virtue or virtue of virtues in the ascetic traditions of ancient India. (Tolerance) - Hindus do not believe one religion can be truer than another; all are considered genuine and true manifestations of God. As such, they deserve tolerance and understanding. And (Truth) - Gandhi dedicated his life to the wider purpose of discovering truth, or Satya. To understand God, Hindus advocate an inward focus, self-inquiry, personal discipline, pilgrimage and purification. \n\nhttp://people.opposingviews.com/hindu-beliefs-shaped-gandhi-2402.html",

            "content": "Gandhi is a biographical film based on the life of Mohandas Gandhi. The movie starts off with Gandhi's assassination in 1948 and his funeral. In the movie they show no parts of Gandhi's early life, instead they show a flashback of Gandhi being thrown off a train in Africa, because he was sitting in first class on a train even though he had a ticket. Gandhi understanding the laws are biased against Indians decides to start a non-violent protest campaign for all Indians in South-Africa. Later on in the story it is then suggested to Gandhi that he should be the one to lead India to independence from the British, because now he is seen as a national hero for his fight in South-Africa. After a long fight the movie leads back to Gandhi's assassination and him being cremated. This movie relates to world religions, because it shows all of the different beliefs in life. It also relates to world religions because, it shows how one man fought for what he believes In so not only his people but others could live and believe in what they wanted to freely without prejudice. The movie was very inspirational as well; because of the long hard fight that Gandhi put to fight for what was right. The depiction of his life was very well written and played out to the point where I thought it was an autobiographical movie at one point. It relayed so much information about Gandhi that I had never known before. I see how Gandhi and the Hinduism beliefs correlate so much as well, both believe in peace and unity and also are non-violent in every way they also both respect one another and their beliefs and don't point prejudice towards anyone for what they believe in or do.",

            "content": "The movie \"Gandhi\" started off with Gandhi's assignation in New Delhi India January 30, 1948 and his funeral. The movie then goes back a 55 years to 1893 in Southern Africa. In South Africa at this time colored people had very few rights and privileges; Gandhi experienced this first had when he was kick out of first class because he was colored. Gandhi writes an article in the paper asking people to gather so they could talk about them getting more rights. He says to the people that gather to burn there passes and take their new passes that gives them more rights. Gandhi starts to burn the passes and the police start to hit him with a stick and continued to hit him with each pass he burned.  After this incident Gandhi again asks the people to fight for their rights; even if it means have to go to prison, they will fight for what is right and holly.\nGandhi goes back to Bombay India in 1915 and travels around India to see, experience and relate to the people. Gandhi decided to live with the peasants, dress like them and travel how they do, in order to relate to them better.  Throughout India there where many group talks, about them having more privileges and wanting to lead them on their own away from British control. At one of the group talk General Dyer order his troop fire at the crowd leaving 1516 dead. After this incident Gandhi told the British they should and let India take care of its self. In 1947 the British left India, but know there was a war between the Hindus and the Muslims about land being divided and who had more power. Before Gandhi's assignation he said that we must get alone and have no violence, because we are all brothers and sisters. \nThis movie relates to world religion; its biggest tie to world religion is to Hinduism. The whole movie is really seen as a way of karma and samsara in action, the cause and effect of the entire movie. Gandhi was kick out of a first class train because he was colored in South Africa. Which then lead him to starting a discussion to the colored people in South Africa about them having more privileges; this was the karma/action that lend to the effect/samsara. The effect was when Gandhi went to India and submerged himself in peasant life and then devoted the rest of his life to getting India to be independent from the British. Then the ultimate effect of the movie was to get Hindus and Muslims to see themselves as brothers and sisters. Dharma plays a big role as well; Gandhi upholds the law, his moral virtue, and social obligation to the cause in hand. He knows what he believes it right and follows through with that belief to make it a reality, as seen throughout the movie.",

This movie really shows how much this peace maker had to go through in his life to stay humble and loving towards everyone. This was the best non-violent protest in known history or better said the most successful non-violent protest. It all started in South America where Gandhi got the government to give the natural rights to the Indians of their country. He ends up in jail but when he comes back to India he is a national hero and people want him to fight for their independence. British Empire sees this and they put him in jail numerous times but they cannot keep him there. People find it hard not be non-violent like Gandhi is and they try to get Gandhi all angry which never works. The British empire is also all wrapped up in world war two at the time so this makes it even harder for them to keep control of India when so many people are demanding their freedom. There then begins a huge religious fight between the Hindus and Muslims and it gets to Gandhi. When he figures out what happens he makes the vogue to fast until this fight stops between the two. He does this and becomes very sick because the war does not stop. Most people that are involved in this war do not believe that he would actually kill himself over this but soon find out that this is no joke. They stop this war but they are not united and end up having to separate into different nations. Gandhi is not happy of this separation and works on brining the two together until his death. This one subject is actually the root of his death because he is assonated over not dropping the subject.",

But after watching I thought what a good movie. Yes three hours seems like a long movie kind of like the titanic but if your into finding out about great worldly people who have made impacts for their religions then this is a great movie. Gandhi reminds me of an Indian Martin Luther King Jr. He not only fought for his kind but fought for all races to be equal.\nHere's a little information on Gandhi. Mahatma Gandhi was born October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India. He studied law and came to advocate for the rights of Indians, both at home and in South Africa. Gandhi became a leader of India's independence movement, organizing boycotts against British institutions in peaceful forms of civil disobedience. He was killed by a fanatic in 1948. (www.biography.com)\nThe movie started out showing his death first and how the whole world mourned his lost. I remember seeing the American reporter who couldn't get past that Mahatma Gandhi who had no education had a bigger funeral then anyone he has seen. Then it went on to show how he grew up and the many things that had happen to him throughout his life. One thing that I thought was crazy was how the South African government set up rules that basically let the cops do whatever to the Indian people. They could walk into their houses at anytime and demand things from their family and wife's and it pissed a lot of them off. He did many of marches which half of them he got sent to a prison camp. One part of the movie that made me tear up was when they were doing a march and the cops were trying every way to stop them. They came in on a heard of horses and the people just laid down and I thought they were going to get ran over for sure but instead the cops just turned around and later eventually arrested Gandhi. After Gandhi was put in prison all the citizens that supported him begin to rally for him. Shortly after that they were having a peaceful protest, the police came and locked everyone in and shot everyone to death. After all the protest that he did, winning independence for his country, and after all the help he gave his people he was eventually shot because he tried to stop the Hindu-Muslim conflict in Bengal, a policy which led to his assassination in Delhi by Nathuram Godse who was a Hindu fanatic. (www.biography.com)\nI learned a lot from this movie and from the religion Hinduism. I think that everyone should be required to take a world religion class because I think it makes you get people better. Like why they do the things they do or how far they have came as a culture. Overall I would rate this movie an 8 and defiantly as must see!",

In 1893, when he was traveling in a train, he was thrown out of train because he was traveling in the first class. Soon after he realized that government is being biased against Indians, he decided to start a non-violent protest campaign for the rights of Indians. During his protest, he went to prison for many times and became center of attention. By looking at his struggle, government announced rights for Indians in South Africa. After this victory, he was called back to India. When he returned to his country, he was welcomed with dignity and Indians considered him as a national hero. Mr. Gandhi started his campaign against British while other leaders like Jinnah collaborated with him. Finally, Britain granted Indians independence, but religious tension begun between Hindus and Muslims. They started fighting with each other which made Gandhi disappointed and he declared hunger strike. He said I won't eat until the fighting stops. The fighting stopped but the country was divided in two parts. Muslims made up a new country named Pakistan based on their majority and Hindus claimed India with their majority. Mr. Gandhi did not want the separation, but he was left with no choice. Gandhi spent his last days trying to bring about peace between both nations. He thereby angered many protesters on both sides, one of whom finally got close enough to assassinate him because he thought Gandhi was too lenient with Muslims. \nThis movie shows the combination of both religions Islam and Hinduism. Mahatma Gandhi was a religious man who believed in non-violent according to his religious teachings as ashima (Brodd, 136). Throughout the movie he was saying that he believed in unity of all religions. Because he believed that all religions have same belief in God. He mentioned the holy books Quran, Bible and Bhagvad Gita for several times. The movies show strong relationship between Mahatma Gandhi and his wife. My favorite dialogue of the movie was when Gandhi's wife said to a reporter that\" My dignity is in following my husband\". It is a really worth watch movie.",

The film then starts off 55 years earlier where 24 year old Gandhi begins to realize how the British laws are biased against Indians after he is thrown off a train South African train for being an Indian sitting first class. So he starts a non-violent protest campaign for the rights of Indians in South Africa. After the campaign succeeds for the most part, he goes back to India and eventually agrees to start a non-violent campaign for India's independence from the British Empire.\n\nWow. Where do I begin with reviewing this movie? I mean as a whole the movie is great with giving us a long but deep and remarkable tale, about this man, but... let's be honest, the real heart of this film is just Ben Kingsley as Gandhi. His performance is what really makes this film so mind blowing. Just how he shows us Gandhi as a man of non-violence and trusting in love and truth and how he reacts to things like his own people fighting either the empire or themselves or whenever he get arrested, or what have you. When you look back at the movie as a whole after you've seen it, you become amazed at how much of Gandhi's life Kingsley give you. And...well really there's nothing else much to say about him. Everything else in the film was greatly done to help Kingsley bring the tale of Gandhi to life. Frankly, the only thing close to a down is that it is pretty long, but they give so much to the story that I'm not completely sure what should've been left out.\n\nAnd that's my review for Gandhi. Everything aside from Kingsley was right on the dot with bringing us what was happening around that time, but it's Kingsley's performance that really brings it to life making Gandhi a great film to the point where it's very little wonder that it won best picture.",

This small group slowly grows into a large following of non-violent protestors who aid Gandhi in his mission to gain freedom. Gandhi gets beaten and arrested several times but he still continues to fight for his people's independence from the British Empire. There are several attempts by the British to stop Gandhi's non-violent movement, and violence is brought to Gandhi and his followers but they never stop resisting.

I also felt that the way the film showed how the people of India were able to come together as one for a common goal showed the essence of the Hindu faith; all are equal and all are one.

He completely, mentally and physically, disappears into this role. Easily one the best acting roles I've ever seen. \nThis is a BIG movie. Not just in length, but in content. I feel bad in how lacking I was in regards to the story of this man, and of India's history. I knew small bits, but never the whole story. Presuming this movie is mostly accurate, I remain astounded at how much of a difference one man can make. \nThe movie gives a wonderful portrayal of a country in turmoil. People starving everywhere, and with little possessions to speak. The British seemingly completely uncaring to the plight of the citizens. The whole scenario was ripe for a \"savior\". The people needed someone to speak out for them, and they got that person in the guise of Mahatma Gandhi. The British trained lawyer turned peaceful activist for change. \nThe cinematography is great in how it shows both the good and bad views of this country. Unlike LOTR and New Zealand, I have no interest in going to India, but I totally appreciate the beauty of country for what it is. \nDefinitely one of the better movies I've watched in a long time. I'm glad I finally took the time to watch it. I think everyone should. It's so sad that we humans are so hung up on killing each other. We never learn, even when great people come along to show us, in a painfully obvious way, what is right. This movie left me with a sadness for the state of our world. If only there were a few more Gandhis walking about.",

            "content": "The movie \"Gandhi\" was very much to my surprise an extremely touching and realistic movie that managed to keep my attention the entire time. The impact this one man made by standing firm against the things he would not cave into, while making his points in a nonviolent way. His teachings made me realize there is a better way of going about doing things.\nGandhi, played by Ben Kingsley, is a soft spoken, observant, and quiet character who proves to be very formidable without being loud or crude in any scene. There is a genuine feeling that the spirit of Gandhi is really on the film. This movie helps portray who the real and true Mahatma Gandhi was. Using nonviolent principles, his movement liberated India in what would be one of the greatest ethical and lucrative triumphs of all time.\nThe movie first began in South Africa when Gandhi is in his early twenties. Although he had a law degree, he was still a target of South Africa's racial segregation system. In this racial centric system, the Indians, who should \"qualify\", are denied full citizenship and manhood. Gandhi's opposition set the tone of the movie while he stands firm against prejudiced laws. When Gandhi returned home to India he traveled around his country to see things he's never seen before. It seems as though he is trying to become a part of India in every way possible, so that he may give her the things she needs. The British are imposing their governance upon the nation because of the \"white man's burden\" code.\nGandhi realizes that the Indians had become second class citizens in their own country, sparking his own civil disobedience. The act was ignored at first by the British, then they scorned it and finally they reluctantly dealt with it. Sometimes it was handled with brutality and sometimes by deception. Gandhi's followers held passive protests but scenes showed many of these protests contained elements of violence. This saddened Gandhi and he began to fast. He denounced the violence of the protests by fasting. He continued to fast until he was convinced that all of the fighting and violence had stopped. Because there were uncanny amounts of violence occurring between the Hindus and the Muslims, Gandhi's fasting leaves him severely under nourished and weak. Once the violence had ended, his strength returned once he started to eat. Throughout the entire movie Gandhi is convinced that he was right and that violence is not the answer. The example that Gandhi set was enough to free India from the British. He liberated this country using nonviolent principals.\nThis movie reminds us, with a little resourcefulness, courage, and a good moral compass, we are all capable of astounding achievements.",

            "content": "The movie \"Gandhi\" was very interesting, as well as inspiring. I honestly had never known a lot about Gandhi, this movie truly opened my eyes about what he did for India, and even the world. Your first introduced to Gandhi when he was a young attorney in South Africa. He is riding on a train when he is thrown off for being \"colored\" and sitting in the white man's first class compartment. As time progresses, Gandhi starts to see the inequalities in the British laws which heavily governed his life. After refusing to give into British law, he is beaten, and even thrown into prison. He starts to speak to all of the Hindu people, telling them that they should have equal rights, and to stand up for what is right. The main point Gandhi stresses throughout the whole entire movie, is to do everything peacefully, with no violence or bloodshed. Soon, the Indian people start to follow what Gandhi is saying. They begin standing up, firmly, but peacefully. British rule catches wind of this, and many times throughout the movie, Gandhi is imprisoned and released. He and his family move to India, where they start to make a real difference. Gandhi encourages the native Indian people to be peaceful, and that they will eventually see an independent India. After starting a \"non-violence cooperation campaign\", millions of Indians start to take a stand, and finally after World War II, they are granted Independence. By this time, Gandhi is quite old, and his wife has passed away. There is sudden tension Between the Muslims and Hindus, which once again, calls on Gandhi to settle. He refuses to eat until the dispute is settled. Finally the 2 countries come to an agreement by dividing the land by religion. Gandhi unfortunately is assonated by a man in one of the last scenes. His funeral is attended by millions and is broadcasted worldwide. \nYou can learn a lot about the Hindu religion by watching \"Gandhi\". When Gandhi is riding on the wagon after arriving at India, one can see the different \"caste\" systems as he rides through the streets. You see rich men and women in nice clothing, then a dingy street in the next scene with starving beggars, with no hope.  Also, Hindu religion is known for being very excepting of other religions. In the movie, Gandhi is said that he was many religions, even though he claims to be a Hindu. He brings up peace for everyone, Christians, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, and many other religions. Hindus believe that we are all seeking \"one truth\" making us all a little interconnected with our religions.",

To be honest it was for a school assignmet, which I was not looking forward to, seeing as it was taking 3 hours out of my already jammed schedule. As we all know hind sight is 20/20. Watching this movie gave me a great sense of faith. If 1 man can provoke that much change in a nation what could we all do if we chose to stand together. Although Hindu, Gandhi made it clear that he felt he was a part of all religions, and that all religions should live together in peace. Gandhi was humble but strong, he was nonviolent, but did not back down from authority. He stood up for his beliefs without taking freedom from another person. He did back down and force an end to his campaign when he saw that it was being abused to cause violence. He put himself in harms way (fasting) to show his people that he did not agree with their ways.Even after this setback he did not give up on his wish for India to become an independant nation. Using symbolism instead of violence he found ways to conquer the English Empire. At one point it is obvious that he feels defeat as he watches his brothers decide to split India and Pakistan (Hindu and Muslim). It is amazing that one man had such an influence over millions of people that they decided to lay down arms to keep him alive. At this point I believe karma comes into play. As Gandhi tells the man to raise a child as his own that is Muslim and that is the way out of hell. When Gandhi gets shot I think he has ended samsara and found Mokshu. That is just my personal opinion. If someone like Gandhi would have to be reborn, there would not be much hope for the rest of us.",
