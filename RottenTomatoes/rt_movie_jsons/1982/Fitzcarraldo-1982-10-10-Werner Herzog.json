Better known as Fitzcarraldo, this foreigner is obsessed with building an opera house in his town and decides that to make his dream a reality he needs to make a killing in the rubber business. In order to become a successful rubber baron, Fitzcarraldo hatches an elaborate plan that calls for a particularly impressive feat -- bringing a massive boat over a mountain with the help of a band of natives.",

This film is a jumbled mess in many ways. It still has many beautiful shots but it just isn't really engaging after a certain point. In the end it comes off as a more of a vanity trip for its director then a good movie.",

Fitzcarraldo (Klaus Kinski) is an opera-loving entrepreneur living in Iquitos Peru, deep in the rainforest on the banks of the Amazon.  In order to raise money to build an opera house, he purchases a nearby but previously inaccessible plot of land with the plan to harvest rubber.  The only barrier?  A steep hill that forces him to physically drag his large ship up in order to be able to access the river on the opposite side.  Despite the distraction of some horrible dubbing and a bloated running time (it would seem the many irrelevant scenes early in the film could have been cut), it is a fascinating character study, thanks to Kinski's passionate performance, of a man blinded by his own absurd dreams.",

            "content": "They say beauty is pain; Herzog returns to the Amazon with Kinski a decade following Aguirre: The Wrath of God (after several other actors that he thought might not be assholes ended up unable or unwilling to make the trek) to trade in the minimalism they had employed previously for a physically grander exploration of passion, madness, nature, and exploitation. It's the classic tale of a self-built man - with nothing but a vision, dedication, an opportunity, and a pile of money from a family member that most people would never have access to, he sets out to do something extraordinary. Herzog tackles a complicated protagonist in Kinski's Fitzgerald, a man who is so enamored with opera as a means of expression that he is willing to put fortune, well-being, and sanity on the line to bring it to his town of Iquitos. But in doing so, for his love of expression and culture he chooses to take advantage of the culture of the native population, playing into their belief that he is a messianic figure and his commercial enterprise a form of their salvation, resulting in not only their toil but the deaths of some of their number. Though his intentions are motivated by a pure intention, he is willing to compromise on the morality of the means by which he delivers upon his vow (even if he feels saddened by these necessities). And as a result, a natural (or naturally divine) vengeance is delivered upon him in his moment of triumph. There is something to be admired in Fitzgerald's perserverance, even if the act itself is bizarre and his conscience not necessarily pure, and when he returns to civilization to see the arrival of the operatic troupe of his dreams, it is a wonderfully conflicted moment; he was not responsible for their arrival and cannot ensure their support, but celebrates the moment as a triumph. He was correct in his capability to complete an insane journey, even if the object of that journey was not a success. Not as atmospheric or thematically engaging as Aguirre, but still a very good piece of film from Herzog that has adopted mythic status as a result of its tortured production. (4/5)",

The fact a gathering of Native Peruvians flocked to the set, a makeshift community was built and then proceeded to level of a side of mountain and drag a fullsize steamboat over it and down the other side is mindboggling to watch.  Let alone the harrowing journey down the rapids that Herzog himself stayed on the boat for, its madness.\n\nSpeaking of madness, Kinski's performance is manic in every sense of the word.   Beads of sweet.  Wild eyed.  Excitable, jittery, insatiable.  It is truly the right man for the right part.  There are two scenes in this movie that are truly magnificent by him.  The first is with his record player on the boat while retorting the natives drum music and the second is the cigar and chair final scene.  He is so masterfully content and proud in these scenes.  He simply radiates self satisfaction. And yes I am aware that he was a terror on set.\n\nI don't think this movie good be made today.  In fact I don't think this movie should be made today, but it is a wonder it was made at all.  The part that kept the entire movie afloat for me, not pun intended, is that periodically you caught glimpses of Herzog's luminous takes of stunning landscape and sets.  His trademark eye for beauty is poking through this movie.  I particularly loved the voyage up the river and the lead up to the final act.  \n\nOutside of a couple side players, the captain is one, I thought besides Kinski the acting was marginal to poor.  Yes I understand a lot of these actors are amateurs, but still.  That kept this movie's grade down to a very respectable-B+",

            "content": "Werner Herzog's Masterclass on Obsession\n\nWerner Herzog's Fitzcarraldo may be remembered as the film wherein he lifted a steamboat over a mountain while fighting off bugs, disease, famine, and Klaus Kinski trying to kill everyone, but it is precisely because of his obsessive persistence in completing the film that Fitzcarraldo is remarkable. It is a parallel on film of Herzog's struggles in finishing the filming of Fitzcarraldo much like Klaus Kinski's character's obsession with opera that leads him to undertake his Amazonian expedition for rubber to fund his opera house.\n\nHerzog appears to have perfected his artistic film-making style from the years doing Aguirre: The Wrath of God & Nosferatu the Vampyre, for Fitzcarraldo is immaculately filmed. Gorgeous scenery, shots of the boats, close ups showing so much emotion and turmoil. Herzog's penchant for showing natives, animals, and nature in their natural surroundings with real reactions is on full display. His cinematography is truly astounding and a wonder to look at in Fitzcarraldo.\n\nThis film utilizes its theme of opera's drama and intensity with its lush sets, real props, atmospheric music as well as operatic performances within the film itself. Herzog's diegetic sounds are audible throughout the movie. The actors bring the Peruvian jungle to life. Claudia is particularly persuasive in the first half where she is present.\n\nThen, Klaus Kinski, as usual in Herzog's films, is the main attraction. Kinski's method acting as the totally obsessed Fitzcarraldo is utterly brilliant and hypnotic. His wild eyes view over all as all he hears is his opera. Opera is his passion and motivation. Kinski portrays this brilliantly. I understand Herzog had to deal with Klaus Kinski going nuts in the jungle in order to film this, but perhaps, it was worth it for Fitzcarraldo is Herzog's masterpiece. Kinski wants his opera house, and he will stop at nothing for that musical bliss.\n\nI recommend seeing at least watching Fitzcarraldo for its achievement in the perseverance of making the film as well as its insane charms as a stand alone Werner Herzog piece. Art films have been filmed that are more mad, but none have been filmed with the same mad drive of Herzog to complete the one and only Fitzcarraldo.",

            "content": "Fitzcarraldo is the story of one man\u2019s determination to do the impossible in order to indulge his passion. It sets up the protagonist\u2019s motivation early with a scene at the opera, and you can sense the excitement and exhilaration that he derives from watching opera. I thought the movie was going to be all about his work on building an opera house in the jungle, but apparently first he needs to make enough money to pay for that dream. It takes some time to get the framework for the story set up and to get all the pieces in place, but I thought they did a good job of getting me emotionally invested in the mission without revealing all the details of what was going to happen. It is slow-going for a while, and I could see some people getting bored by it, but eventually they embark on the journey and the adventure truly begins. Before talking about all the exciting events that start in act two, I have to take a moment to talk about one of the hardest things to deal with in Fitzcarraldo. Every single line in the movie was done with ADR, so the sync with the mouths was never accurate. It is astounding how distracting that can be, particularly when the original actor was delivering the recorded line for himself, so he is saying the same thing both in video and audio, but they don\u2019t flow as one. Also, if they\u2019re going to have Klaus Kinski playing Fitzcarraldo and are going to record a voice to put in his mouth anyways, why not put in an Irish voice to fit the character instead of his original German? This kind of thing isn\u2019t a serious detriment to the quality of the film because it doesn\u2019t change the story, but it\u2019s so hard not to focus on that when the characters talk instead of the content of their dialogue. When they finally revealed the full scope Fitzcarraldo\u2019s plan, I was shocked. I couldn\u2019t believe what they were going to do, and I was delighted that they showed them trying to execute this crazy plan. From that point on the stakes went up so high, and I was thrilled to see what would happen. They kept enough mystery about how it would play out, that I was riveted. There were certainly some scenes where they dragged it out a bit too much, but most of the way through I didn\u2019t feel the length of this movie at all, and it is a long one. The conclusion was satisfying, and in a different way than I expected. Klaus Kinski was great in the titular role, because he had moments where he was level-headed and you could identify with him, and other times he was that obsessed guy who was almost out of control. Fitzcarraldo is a very good film, and even though there are some elements I wish were done differently, I still enjoyed it a lot.",

The plot is more sophisticated than Aguirre, but Herzog is still more interested in his wonderment of visuals it is as unpredictable as Aguirre, especially when it comes to the moments where they have to pull his ship up a mountain. It is done, not by models,,, but literally pulling an actual ship up the mountain. Herzog states that the audience will be able to tell a model from an actual ship.  The whole set became troublesome and is shown in the masterful documentary, Burden of Dreams. Other sequences include the meeting of the natives and how they admire the mad drive of Fitzcarraldo. This is not a perfect film, because the last passages are anti-climactic, completely unlike Apocalypse Now and Aguirre. Those two movies composed an evocative and haunting conclusion. Not so with Fitzcarraldo, but  how can you top the sequences with the ship going up the mountain? A lesser film would probably have a better ending, but certainly not the visionary experience from Herzog, so the climax is almost inevitably anticlimactic. Still, Fitzcarraldo is a film like no other and continues to be transcendent. The performance by Kinski is little more likable than Aguirre much in part to the opening passages with his girlfriend. She stands by him and gives him a certain drive to build on his mad vision.",

One does not realize they are watching a film, but rather experiencing a documentary unfolding live in the late 20th century.  I had wanted to see this film for a long time and am glad I finally had the pleasure to view it.  What is most coincidental is that I finally accessed a copy and prepared to watch it one day, when I happened by it on the television at the same time!  That is as unworldly as the film.  The only criticism is its length, which may have been edited down by 30 minutes.  However, I enjoyed every minute as is.",

The undertaking pays off and makes for some great footage and it is crazy to see a ship being filmed as it essentially crashes (and injures several people) for the sake of five minutes or so of footage. This film has a sense of adventure like no other and that applies to the off-screen antics too- everything about this film is wild.\n\nThe performances are strong but whether Kinski should have been cast yet again by Herzog for this one is debatable- his performance is typically strong of course but his distinctive presence doesn't stand out as much here as with the previous Herzog/Kinski collaborations. Apparently, Jack Nicholson was considered for the role which may have been interesting indeed, The supporting cast are strong with Huer... Huereqeq..., I can't type it but THE GUY WHO PLAYED THE COOK, provides the laughs as the typical drunkard and Cardinale gives a sweet performance as Fitzgerald's other half.\n\nThe plot is strong, with a fair amount of things going on outside of the mountain-climbing 300 ton ship but a fair amount of the film is similar to 'Aguirre...' whereby they are travelling by sea and are surrounded by the threatening indigenous populations around them but for the most part, the film is unique. \n\nThe issue is the film's length- Herzog has a lot of relatively short films so to see one clock in at over two and a half hours is fairly unusual. It's a fine length for a film of course but Herzog's slow shots and basic story-progression makes this one difficult to get through while being fully engaged. It's understandable why a lot of the footage wasn't cut considering how difficult it was to capture but there's some relatively unimportant parts of the story that could have been cut to speed things up.\n\nThe dialogue is okay but it's nothing special whatsoever and as is often the case with Herzog, it feels fairly rushed and could maybe use some finessing. This is a visual film though and so it's not a big issue.\n\nOverall, it's a  good film but it just can't justify its length and it lacks the power that some other Herzog pieces have. It's also not as visually exciting as a whole- the ship scenes are brilliant but there isn't as much eye candy elsewhere as one might expect from Herzog. It's still a must-see for anyone with a passing interest in Herzog or Kinski but its length makes it overbearing and thus not particularly appropriate if you're after a quirky little action/adventure to pass the time.",

I can't think of any other filmmaker in history who would dare make a film like this- a film about a wealthy landowner who wants to build an opera house in the middle of the Amazon jungle- and in order to do so, he has to tow a 300-ton boat over a mountain- which is what the mad man who made this film- Werner Herzog- did at the insistence of engineers who said that towing a huge and heavy boat over a mountain using only ropes would kill everyone standing near the boat and that it could most likely not be done.\n\nWhat staggers me about Herzog's vision is the extreme lengths he goes to achieve it. Any person calling themselves a filmmaker has to respect Herzog's determination and willingness to achieve his one vision of madness and obsession. And that is what FITZCARRALDO is about. It is, like AGUIRRE: THE WRATH OF GOD- an obsessive film about obsession. The film is set at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries and stars German actor and longtime Herzog collaborator Klaus Kinski as the madman who wants to build an opera house in the jungle. There, he overcomes obstacle after obstacle- and apparently he achieves this goal. The film gives off an interesting notion at the end- this film could largely be happening inside of Fitzcarraldo's (Kinski) mad mind. That makes sense- but the film strikes the perfect balance between reality, delusion and obsession. \n\nFITZCARRALDO is a great film- one of the great visions of the cinema. This is a film, like Roger Ebert put it- APOCALYPSE NOW, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, or even THE WAGES OF FEAR or LAWRENCE OF ARABIA. It's the kind of film made by an intensely driven, possibly insane man who would stop at nothing to achieve his vision out of sheer passion for moviemaking. Few filmmakers of that caliber have ever existed- the great filmmakers- the ones who are consumed by their cinematic vision- that they themselves become a sole creative force and worked themselves into legend. Herzog has done that here.",

To do this, he rounds up a crew of individuals to be part of his massive vessel, purchased by a wealthy brothel owner (Claudia Cardinale), which he will use to get up the Ucayali River (a tributary of the Amazon). As the journey commences, problems and tensions mount, including the voyage into the jungle with tribes that could or could not be blood thirsty, as well dragging the massive vessel across a hill from one body of water to another. Fascinating spectacle with an unusual pairing of Cardinale and Kinski in one movie, with wonderful photography and sense of being part of the actual spectacle. Herzog's films are always bizarre, and thankfully, always interesting, especially this one. He must of loved South America, since he did at least two films down there (the other being the great \"Aguirre: Wrath of God\" released in 1972).",

Wages of Fear, The African Queen and most famously Apocalypse Now (wreaking havok both infront and behind the camera) all understood the power of such an alien land. Fitzcarraldo understands and embraces that insanity, mining a seam that runs so deep as to be endless.\r\n\r\nBrian Sweeney Fitzgerald (Fitzcarraldo to the locals) dreams, yearns, to bring opera to the heart of Peru. To acheive the money and notoriety such an endeavour requires he takes on the task of harvesting rubber from the deepest, darkest parts of the rainforest. Aquiring a steamboat and a crew he sets about his task with a kind of fevered ambition.\r\n\r\nKlaus Kinski plays Fitzgerald with no shame, no fear and an air of charisma that could change worlds. His bug eyes, white teeth and electric hair hum and buzz with the passion of his goal which he pursues relentlessly. His is a performance that throws out the rule book and converts non believers.\r\n\r\nFitzgerald has no money to speak of, speculating in a failed railway and the delivery of ice to sustain a meagre (opera filled) existence. To fund his expedition he borrows money from the madam of a local brothel, the desire of men to fuck ceaselessly being directly channeled into man's desire to create is a blackly comic hint at things to come.\r\n\r\nDeep into the rainforest, with his crew having fled, Fitzgerald unveils his plan to his three remaining men. If they can only drag the steamboat over a mountain untold riches will be theirs. He enlists the help of savage natives by subdueing them with opera and his boat (\"they know we are not gods but the ship has really impressed them....\" is a memorable line) and together they clear a path and begin to undertake the impossible.\r\n\r\nDirected with a command of the medium and a zeal that more than reflects his protagonist, Herzog has made a formidable film. A giant story that speaks to everyone with even a flicker of desire or passion to pass on to others. Religious without being so crass as to invoke god whilst simultaneously celebrating the creation of art and that same futility Fitzcarraldo has lasted this long and will continue for as long as we do.",

The film is almost a documentary account of its director Werner Herzog's own obsession; at its end, when the main character has a triumphant welcoming after literally hauling a huge ship over a mountain and then successfully navigating it through previously unconquered rapids, it is very much Herzog's victory we are watching.

            "content": "**** out of ****\r\n\r\nSome people can't make their wildest dreams come true simply because they don't try hard enough. Laziness is an essential part of human nature, yes, but who are we to say that we cannot overcome it? Werner Herzog understood this and was inspired by an Irishman who went by the name of Fitzcarraldo; a resident of Peru, but not necessarily a native. It was this inspiration that led to the making of one of his biggest and most deeply-felt motion pictures yet; \"Fitzcarraldo\", named after the underappreciated man who was a rare dreamer who sought to make his romanticized visions of heroism and fame reality. I've not seen many films where a dreamer had to endure quite as much as the titular Fitzcarraldo - or Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald, if you prefer the name he was born to, or Fitz, as his adoring mistress called him -. But then again, that's the magic of a Herzog film; he can take you to places you've never been to or seen before, for prolonged periods of time, and immerse you in the people that find themselves there. Herzog is a dreamer; this is his grand spectacle.\r\n\r\nAs the film opens, a man dressed rather fancily in white hat and coat approaches an Opera House with a woman that he has brought along with him. He is Fitzcarraldo (Klaus Kinski), and the woman is Molly (Claudia Cardinale); and they have just come a long ways to see a single show. They are allowed into the House, and we finally understand why Fitzcarraldo was so desperate to attend the performance. After the show, he confronts wealthy individuals who he anticipates might be potential investors or curious parties in regards to his dream - to build a giant opera house in Iquitos, where he is living at the moment. Fitzcarraldo loves the opera, and he allows the music to enter his body at will and circulate right through it; it wouldn't be too hard to believe that he might just have what it takes to turn his passion into something more, something bigger, and something of far greater importance than a mere obsession. \r\n\r\nThe rich scoff at his dreams, spit in his face, socially; and say he will never succeed in achieving his goals. Fitzcarraldo isn't ready to believe this, but he accepts the reality of the situation; you need money, and you need a lot of business partners. Those are two things that he lacks, and so he cannot build the opera house quite yet. But, he is determined; and so he seeks out resources in the way of Peru's most profitable industry, rubber. Sadly, rubber trees are limited, and he must seek them out for himself if he wishes to make any money off his findings; he will need transportation, and plenty of members within a work force. That is where the iconic steamboat comes in; an impressive vessel that Fitzcarraldo purchases and renovates so that he can make the trip into dangerous territories (and rapids) in order to access the rubber trees. He rounds up a crew, and in no time, he's on his way.\r\n\r\nBut the waters that he treads are deep and apprehensive. The area is infamous for the primitive tribes that inhabit the shores; perhaps because they haven't let a single soul pass yet. But maybe Fitzcarraldo and his interest in the grand Opera will work a sort of magic on these underdeveloped beings; and so it does. He plays the music once they have invaded the steamer, and almost instantaneously, they sink into a deep, hypnotic trance. Now, they work for Fitzcarraldo and company. But the question still remains: will the boat and the crew be able to survive the unrelenting rapids of the region? Will the rumored spiritual and more diabolical forces be at work, thus preventing the vessel from completing its journey? I don't have all the answers, or at least I don't have a good deal of them for you now, but that's mostly due to my desire to spoil at little about the film as possible. It's the kind that has to be experienced; the same goes for most of Herzog's earlier (and even later) works. He's an incredible man, and this is an incredible movie; it surpasses the level of mere movie magic. It is inspiring, but all too real to resonate with the mainstreamers that typically fall head over heels in love with its kind.\r\n\r\nThe production was reportedly tense; and it tested the heart and soul of both Herzog and Kinski, who was said to be an unpleasant person to work with, at times. It is said that Kinski would overreact about silly matters off-stage, and that his rage upset the extras that were playing the Indian tribesmen-and-women of the film. But you know what they say: some of the best movies are not easily made, and such is the case here. Though the production and filming were both apparently heart-wrenching in their own little ways, the movie was completed, and so was the steamboat's journey. By the end, we feel both happiness and sadness; happiness, because we have just experienced an honest and down-to-earth portrayal of a mad dreamer, and sadness, because he almost returns home empty-handed. Although then, Herzog makes a bold move and adds on to that conclusion with a few absurd but uplifting images; in which a much happier and more uplifting ending is supplied. \r\n\r\nThe quality of the film doesn't necessarily matter; as you probably already know it even if you haven't yet seen the actual movie in its entirety. Kinski is, as always, riveting; and Herzog's direction is typically fearless, and his images genuinely moving. Being a film that spans two hours and a half in length, this is a sprawling epic that makes use of one location and many provocative, resonant sights. It's a very scenic sort of movie; not unusual for Herzog, who loves nature and just about everything about it, and I loved how he made use of the wildlife of Peru, such as pigs and fish that will eat large wads of cash. There are also horses that drink beer; although it's a known fact that the creatures love that stuff. Nevertheless, my point is this: Herzog is in touch with all his inner feelings here, and this is one of my all-time favorites, not only from him, but from cinema in a whole. It's a definitive masterpiece that should just about sum up what I love best about the movies; all in due time. There is a documentary on the making of the film titled \"Burden of Dreams\"; the title defining the message of \"Fitzcarraldo\". I will see that documentary; because I could use a better understanding of a film that comes with such divine and impeccable whimsy.",

Most great movies are that way.  So to that degree I shouldn't have the audacity to apply a rating to a movie I've only seen once... but I can't own or re-watch every movie -- most movies aren't worth owning or necessarily re-watching anyway, so.  At any rate, at first watch I called this \"an amazing and undeniably humbling epic.\"  Of course that was true, but my rating was an understatement.

It portrays would-be rubber baron Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald, an Irishman known as Fitzcarraldo in Peru, who has to pull a steamship over a steep hill in order to access a rich rubber territory. The film is derived from the real-life story of Peruvian rubber baron Carlos Fitzcarrald. In the 1890s, Fitzcarrald did bring a steamship across an isthmus from one river into another, but it weighed only 30 tons (rather than over 300), and was carried over in pieces to be reassembled at its destination.\nIn his autobiographical film Portrait Werner Herzog, Herzog has stated that the film's spectacular production was partly inspired by the engineering feats of ancient standing stones. The film production was an incredible ordeal, and famously involved moving a 320-ton steamship over a hill without the use of special effects. Herzog believed that no one had ever performed a similar feat in history, and likely never will again, calling himself \"Conquistador of the Useless\".Three similar-looking ships were bought for the production and used in different scenes and locations, including scenes that were shot aboard the ship while it crashed through rapids, injuring three of the six people involved in the filming.This movie is a perfect vehicle to the stormed performance by the genius Klaus Kinski, the almost documental Herzog's style and the hypnotic music of the progressive band Popol Vuh, plus the stunning cinematography.",

Their strange relationship devolved into antipathy. It also included one of the most lavish film feats in history. Herzog decided to move a 320-ton steamship over a hill without using special effects. Such an expensive and arduous undertaking made the film infamous and Herzog aptly described himself as the \"Conquistador of the Useless\" for his accomplishment. Shortly afterwards, the film was followed by an acclaimed making of documentary, Burden of Dreams. The film was a critical success, but it nearly destroyed the relationship between Herzog and Kinski, one of the finest creative teams in movie history. Anyway, Fitzcarraldo remains a favorite with Herzog's fans, but the film arguably never achieved the legendary status it seemed destined to enjoy.

In this regard, it has an ironic similarity to \"Apocalypse Now\" - right down to the fact that both movies had documentaries about their making and the mad obsessions of their directors.  Then it culminates in its huge sequence in which Fitzcarraldo attempts to get the steamboat dragged over the top of a mountain - and this reminded me of (sorry for the obscure reference)  the bell sequence in Tarkovsky's \"Andrei Rublev\".\n\nThe movie suffers from a slow, extended first act and the fact that even when it picks up, Herzog doesn't have the entertainment instincts of Coppola, so the pacing remains languid and it still drags (no pun intended) a little.  The danger only occasionally gets pumped up.\n\nIt is still a wonderfully audacious story about an audacious man, played by an audacious (and supposedly insane) leading man.

            "content": "The story of Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald, aka Fitzcarraldo, is as much the story of his magnanimous pie in the sky ideal to push a boat over a mountain as it is Werner Herzog's own mission to film it. More than a mission- as anyone who saw Burden of Dreams can report- an obsession that might cost a few lives, a good deal of money, and bring a lot of strange first-hand looks at the lives and mind-sets of the natives, but will still bring the greatest of wonders if it gets pulled off. The boat over the mountain is part metaphor, anyway, though not one that's easily pegged into a corner. Achieving something against the odds is something that has been covered in many great films, a quest through man's indelible need to make the impossible possible, be it in a David Lean picture ala Lawrence of Arabia, or in one of Cecil B. DeMille's pictures (and, at times, I wondered if the spirit of one of those old time epic filmmakers came into his mind, if only in bits).\n\nAll the while as Herzog is out to map the course of this man who just wants the purity of opera in the jungle, but through a style that is completely all his own, which means that it's not just about one man, but also about the ones around him, the methods to following such delusions of grandeur. Like Aguirre, there's a God complex working in Fitzcarraldo, only this time it's not in the total shroud of madness. There's room for irony, spouts of wild humor (sometimes from Kinski, like when he tries to play an opera record for disinterested party-goers early on in the film), and an overwhelming fascination with what's all around Fitzcarraldo, the jungle, nature, the natives that dwell there and always stick to their indeterminable ways. Watching how Herzog maneuvers through his bulky story is ceaselessly compelling, even in the moments where he just lets the camera take everything in: the waves crashing all around, the boat set against the jungle-scape with the opera singer Caruso in the background, the many faces and poses of the natives and their moments of pure calm versus their unpredictable nature (why do they put on face paint like they're about to go to war, and then nothing happens, don't ask me).\n\nAnd like in many of his best films, Herzog manages to get much more out of his actors/non-actors and his locations than it might have seemed on paper. Poetry gets set into motion with seemingly the greatest of ease, like a scene where a few natives on a small canoe look on, and Fitzcarraldo thinks about stopping, but they just go on as it's not even worth it, or when he and his first-mate and couple other regulars on the ship try to eat, only surrounded by the natives. Or the shocking moments when after victory seems to be achieved, all is in peril as the boat flaps about on the river and the recording still goes on and on, haunting as anything the jungle can compare to. Indeed, the jungle itself becomes another key part of Herzog's metaphor, even more so than in Aguirre, and it's perfectly exploited (or rendered, depending on point of view) for Herzog's own feelings about the jungle. It's an environment dangerous, alluring, and with the capacity to fear its awesome mass as well as beauty (or, as Herzog said in 'Burden', it's lovable against better judgment), so it's not all taken in at a distance- there isn't so much a real sense of escapism via the hand-held shots unlike in the epics of the directors previously mentioned. Fitcarraldo's own quest then is against nature's own ways- nature is objective and always the same- as the simple notion of moving the boat, and then doing it, goes against nature's true nature, if that makes sense.\n\nIn this sense it's a great film of the objective, to which Herzog goes to lengths to capture, *and* the fantastical and subjective, which comes through the operatic portions, and not be bound by nature's usual ways and common sense. Thus it makes perfect sense as well to have Kinski along for the ride, even if it's not his greatest achievement with his most frequent director. It's all in the eyes, practically every step of the way, that one believes this man even through all of the follies and naive flights of fancy, and it's the closest Kinski probably ever came to playing the romantic lead of an adventure picture. Some of the usual scenes of 'damn he's nuts' come up, like his ringing of the town bell. It's another in the line of outcasts he played in Herzog's films, tormented and always in craving for something more, though this time not in a bleak manner. There is the problem that Kinski's presence would be undermined by the many \"adequate\" images Herzog loves to achieve. Luckily, he stands his ground, and even contributes to the poetry in times of just listening to the Caruso, and gazing on at his dream coming true on the mountainside.\n\nFitzcarraldo isn't perfect by any means, as it ends up by way of the nature of Herzog's storytelling to almost tell of too much in his scenes. And the English language track I heard sometimes dilutes a few of the performances by feeling too dubbed and a little ridiculous in some instances. But these are just tiny mentions that get overlooked when looking at the success of what is done. Only a director as intelligently deranged and confident as Herzog could have dreamed up this film (based on a true character) and make it as real and alive as the greatest of epic adventures.",

The story of the making of the movie is at least as interesting as the movie itself, mainly because Herzog actually pulled a boat over a mountain and didn't use any special effects. The movie was actually shot out in the middle of the Amazon rain forest, and all sorts of problems plagued the production, including attacks by natives and a crew member having to cut his foot off after a snake-bite. So, just as a document of craziness, the movie is extremely interesting. (There is also a documentary, Burden of Dreams, about its making, which I intend to watch eventually). Klaus Kinski is convincing as the madman who leads the expedition, apparently because Kinski actually just was a madman in real life. The only problem, really, is that the movie just isn't terribly dramatically engaging. The plot goes here and there, and a few supporting characters are sketched out, but it doesn't actually end up making too much difference.

            "content": "I am yet again left speechless and amazed after watching another of Herzog and Kinski's masterpieces, Fitzcarraldo. After being mesmerised by Aguirre, the Wrath of God, I decided to watch more of their work but didn't expect them to rise to such heights again, I was very wrong, while Fitzcarraldo isn't a better film than Aguirre, it's still a masterpiece. It differs from Aguirre in quite a few ways, this film is far more plot-driven than Aguirre and relies much more on character development than on atmosphere. \r\n\r\nSPOILERS AHEAD.... Fitzcarraldo's real name is Brian Fitzgerald but none of the indians can pronounce that so he changed it, he lives in Equito a small Peruvian town far away from the larger cities. He has recently been bankrupted when his venture to build a Trans-Andean railway collapsed. He now relies on his partner Molly for money. \r\nHe is an avid Opera fan and his greatest wish is to see an Opera house built in Equito seeing as the closest one is about 2000 miles away! None of the extremely wealthy capitalists want to invest in an Opera house preferring to make or lose money for themselves without giving anything back to the people. But Fitzcarraldo is not like them, he wishes to bring his passion for Opera to Equito not only for himself but for anyone who might be interested.\r\n To do this he needs money and the surest way to make money in those parts is the Rubber business. But all the land around has been bought already, except for one large chunk which lies beyond some deadly rapids and is therefore inaccessible. Fitzcarraldo buys it, with Molly's money of course and then proceeds to purchase and repair a Steamship which he names Molly Aida.\r\nFitzcarraldo sets of to bring back proof that his newly purchased land is accessible, but instead of heading down the Pongo river (a tributary of the Amazon) where his land is he heads for the Pachitea river which runs parallel to the Pongo but goes deep into Native Indian territory.\r\nAccompanying him are the Captain of the ship Paul, the engineer Cholo, the cook Huerequeque and the crew. As they head into the jungle filled with hostile Indians his crew desert and he is left only with three men :the Captain, The cook and the engineer.\r\nHe then arrives at a point in the river where it swerves in very close to the Pongo, he reaveals his plan: to tow the Steamship up the hill and drop it into the Pongo on the other side, with the help of some Indians who have strange purposes of their own and his small group of men Fitzcarraldo sets about this seemingly impossible task.\r\n\r\nThe direction of this film was superb, though very different from Aguirre it is just as memorable. It was put to better use at telling the story than in Aguirre so it sacrifices some of its dreamlike quality. I got the impression that Herzog was more used to Kinski's acting so was able to capture it more efficiently on film. Herzog's direction is perfectly paced and lays out all aspects of the plot clearly, he couldn't have done a better job. Some shots were just amazing especially those of the Steamship being raised on to the land accompanied by the Opera named Caruso which Fitzcarraldo plays all the time.\r\n\r\nThe acting was good from the whole cast although nothing exceptional, overall the performances were good from pretty much everyone including Claudia Cardinale who plays Molly, but Klaus Kinski overshadows all of them with one of the best and most underrated performances ever. He really becomes his character and his extreme emotions are visible on his face throughout the whole film. \r\n\r\nThe soundtrack was not as stunning as in Aguirre, but was still good. It of course contains many Opera's and often the same one (Caruso) but I didn't get bored of hearing them. The rest of the music is mainly native indian music or surreal music similar to that of Aguirre.\r\n\r\nThe dialogue was in English, which I hadn't expected seeing as most of the cast were german or Spanish speakers. Kinski's accent does slip at times but is overall easily bearable to hear. The dialogue is much less vague and bizarre than in Aguirre, it helps the plot move along much more.\r\n\r\nThe characters were far more important than in Aguirre, the film revolves around Fitzcarraldo a man who has discovered something immensely beautiful (Opera) and wishes to share it with his fellow men, he is not a Capitalist like his acquaintances , he doesn't enjoy making money, he just needs money to accomplish his dream. He is also an ingenious and very intelligent man and the plan he contrives really astounded me. All the other characters were secondary to Fitzcarraldo but they were interesting in their own right, Cholo the engineer is helping him just for the fun and the challenge of it. The natives are helping for some unknown reason, i've never seen such inscrutable characters in a film before, this effect isn't helped by the fact that Herzog chose not to translate what they say so they are basically incomprehensible just like their motives. \r\n\r\nThe plot was very interesting and really quite crazy, it is based on a real character who did actually pull a ship over a mountain but his ship wayed ten times less than the one used in this film. That is what is so crazy about this film, Herzog and his cast actually pulled a 300 ton ship over a steep hill even though the engineers claimed such a feat was impossible. Fitzcarraldo's obsession with Opera really drives the plot forward and makes the character accomplish incredible things, it isn't showed in a bad way though like obsession often are but actually seemed to set Fitzcarraldo above his peers. The ending is one of the most tragic yet fitting endings I have ever seen, it really impressed me Herzog has directed a masterpiece. I won't reveal anymore though as it has to be seen not read.\r\n\r\nOverall this is an amazing and epic film that is sadly overlooked and underrated. Herzog received the award for best Director at Cannes and he deserved much more. \r\n\r\nVery Highly recommended to everyone. Fans of Herzog will love it as will people who are new to his film. But if you are to much of a fan of mediocre films out of Hollywood then I can't guarantee you will like it as it makes you think unlike many other films.\r\n\r\nCinematography       10/10\r\nActing                9/10\r\nSoundtrack            9/10\r\nScreenplay           10/10\r\nPlot                 10/10",

The lead actor is almost too strange to look at and the entire film is riddled with gross abuses of nature. Almost unwatchable, and definitely the weakest Herzog film I've ever seen.",

Getting the boat through the waters, getting the natives' trust, and avoiding the dangerous natives, and also gettting the 300 ton ship over a mountainside are just some of the troubles he must go through.\r\n\r\nInsanely, Herzog filmed this with no miniatures or studio sets, and they did, as the true story was 100 years ago, pull the giant boat over the mountain. Also, there were death threats, a lot of injuries, and actors Jason Robards and Mick Jagger cancelling at the last minute. But wow, insanity has its merits I guess.",
