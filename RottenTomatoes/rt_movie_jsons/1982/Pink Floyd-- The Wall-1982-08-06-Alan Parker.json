    "summary": "In this visual riff on Pink Floyd's album \"The Wall,\" successful but drugged-out musician Pink (Bob Geldof) is looking back on his isolated childhood from the confines of a Los Angeles hotel room. Through a swirl of flashbacks and chemical-induced hallucinations, Pink recalls his lonely upbringing, during which he built a symbolic wall to the world as he coped with the death of his father (James Laurenson) and the overbearing ways of his mother (Christine Hargreaves).",

The first half can be boring at times and the second half can get almost random and confusing but it's not random if you understand what it means. And of course a incredible sound track due to Pink Floyd.",

Mixing the animation into live action and increasing the value of the trial.

A mix of live action and animation, the live action sequences, directed by Alan Parker, tend to be inconsistent, ranging from effective (the ‘In the Flesh/Run Like Hell' sequence is powerful) to frantic and amateurish (pretty much the rest of the movie), while Gerald Scarfe's animation is generally excellent.  Unfortunately, the combining of the two just muddies the water and makes the whole thing a confusing mess.  The music, as you'd expect, is excellent and forces one to ask a really simple question: why not just skip the movie and listen to the album?",

            "content": "Circa 1983, I was 12 years old and my parents had recently divorced. Although I was keeping a lot inside, my older brother, who was 16 at the time, sensed my emotional turmoil and was kind enough to drag me along with his friends to the midnight movies, part of the social experience of being a teenager in the 1980s. The midnight movie was Pink Floyd The Wall. My brother also knew how much I loved that album because I practically wore out the cassette tape. Watching that film as a 12 year old was probably more than I should be able to handle given it’s dark themes, violent images, some sexual imagery and seeing the hedonist and sometimes very ugly side of rock and roll culture. However, the film completely blew my young 12 year old mind. As I had previously been listening to the album on cassette, I already had some imagery my mind created from the music itself and now I was actually seeing someone else’s idea of that imagery on the big screen! My imagination was a flame with delight. While the imagery I had created in my head was different, of course, it was strange how some of it seemed familiar to me or close to how I was previously imagining what was going on in that concept album. At a time in my young life where my own personal bricks were being added to the persona of my wall, I had a kind, caring older brother who introduced me to an incredible piece of artwork that has left a positive mark on my soul. Some may say it is just a film or some may say it is a sloppy film or an overtly, self-indulgent music video that goes on too long for its own good. However, i’ve had such a personal experience with it that it remains one of my favorite movies.",

We see flashbacks or fantasies, of bomber-filled skies during World War Two, memories of his childhood with his overprotective mother and of the school he went to as a child, adult memories of his tuning out his wife, who leaves him for another man, a sudden \"turn\" where he acts violently and smashing everything in his apartment, animations involving fascism and a wall, himself as a fascist leader. He only comes to life when a bunch of people have to give him a drug injection so he can perform a concert show.\n\nThe movie is based on Pink Floyd's super-hit album \"The Wall\", though one song is referenced that wasn't in the album. But what does the movie represent? Pink has as much character as a department store mannequin, and we don't really find out anything about him, or why he is such a passive character. Burned out on drugs, or fame? Really, the movie is a whole bunch of images (often repeated), and the whole isn't greater than the sum of its parts.",

It serves as a stark and frightening demonstration of fame gone bad and shows us that money, sex, fame, and adoration do NOT equate to happiness.

It demonstrates a creativity and range almost exclusively seen by only anthology and animated pictures to this point. Combing cel animation, inventive makeup, German expressionism, surrealism and even combining cel animation with live action years before it was perfected in Who Framed Roger Rabbit to craft one of the most under appreciated pictures in cinematic history.

I think anyone who is or is not a fan will have an interesting and unique experience. Any sort of character development comes through the music, which itself tells the whole story. This will be the closest we will ever come to examine Roger Waters mindset and feelings.\n\nThe songs themselves are not only amazing, but brilliantly expressed and unequal compared to other bands. The animated sequences that went with the songs were so remarkable it makes the songs strike an extra chord to your subconscious.\n\nOverall rating: RIP Alan Parker.

It stars Pink, a rock star suffering through many hardships through his life, like the absence of his father, an unfaithful wife, and his total mental isolation from the outside world. It's definitely not a movie for everyone, with mental illness, loneliness and war all being main themes prevalent throughout the film. It's a film filled with imagery and symbolism, most of which is dark and ominous to reflect the downward spiral of Pink's sanity. The film has very little dialogue as well, choosing more to rely on silence and the music from 'The Wall' album, which also makes it enjoyable for any Pink Floyd fan. While being a unique and interesting film, it definitely fills you feel a sense of despair while viewing. As that is the point of the movie, it shouldn't be counted against it, but if depressing or disturbing movies aren't your thing, stay away from it. If not, it's a truly thought provoking movie and you should give it a try.",

The living quarters looks like purgatory or some kind of prison giving you the feeling that everyone is the same and living through the same hell and no one is different or unique. The old time music gives me 'The Shining' vibe. Really great how they build the tension. \n\nLoving the use of metaphors in this movie like the whole 'hammers' propaganda representing the Nazi's. I like the comparison of war on the battlefield and war on the streets. It's pretty clever how they used the songs from The Wall to tell the story as dialogue instead of the characters really talking much. \n\nHere's a guy who has completely lost himself and has lost reason to live. These animations are amazing especially given that it's the 80's and nothing could be easily computerized. Pretty great writing and metaphors. The old child self is trying to find out where everything went to shit and why everything went to shit in his grown self. Those are some pretty terrifying visuals when he's transforming. \n\nPretty dark stuff in this movie. Leave it to Roger Waters to leave the viewer with a feeling of hopelessness and feeling of emptiness inside. It's like where the fuck is hope? Where the fuck is optimism? He's way too much of a cynical person to give you a somewhat hopeful ending message. It almost feels like at times that Waters got really personal and emotional and tied himself into the story. Some parts were kind of obscure with what the message was. Such as why Pink hallucinated that he was a Neo Nazi leader. Maybe in his mind, he felt like he was conforming and dead inside or the injection could have been a metaphor for Western medicine which sometimes makes things worse instead of helping. But overall great movie. \n\nVery impactful with the topics and it's messages. I liked it even more when I saw the aesthetic and feel kind of reminded me of Terry Gilliam's style. Even though the movie is inspired by one of y favorite Pink Floyd albums, I have to say the material is way too  serious for me to want to watch again. I'll watch it again in a couple of years.",

He grows up, but has so blocked out his feelings that he can't express them to his wife (and he also seems to be heavily addicted to drugs, though these aren't expressly seen other than what may be some hash) so she looks for emotional comfort elsewhere. He starts to grow so much hatred within himself that he envisions a group of hate that can destroy everything, very similar to the Nazis, and maybe an ode to the theory of how if Hitler had been encouraged to be an artist he never would have been the mass murderer we know him as. Finally at the end he is writing a song, and at this point he is ordered, perhaps by himself, to tear the wall down, which is what the artist often does when they turn to songwriting. In fact, the song Pages by Three Doors Down discusses this pretty well. Overall, the movie was by no means dull and was visually very interesting, though the graphics were much too sexualized and hallucinogenic for my taste. Also, there are a lot of genital monsters in the film, which is kinda weird. Interesting movie, and I don't think it's bad, but I probably won't be watching it again.",

I'm still asking myself questions about the metaphors and they left such an imprint on my perspective on society. My mouth was literally wide open throughout the film, and I felt like my eyes were gonna pop out. Pink Floyd's The Wall is such an underrated masterpiece and has just become my favorite musical. It might even be the best musical ever made. This tale of conformity may be ugly, but there can be beauty lying in it.",

After that, it was a fun ride with awesome music and I was literally glued to watching it and couldn't stop for some reason. The animation segments were great and were some of my most favourite sections of the film. Choosing Bob Geldof to play Pink was a perfect choice. Though lacking much diolage (and even much of any action for the most part), just seeing his expression of the body and the face throughout the film was enough to show me just how insane he's really becoming.

The story goes through the building of the wall, shows what it's like inside the wall but then proceeds to have Pink begin to suffer mental illness from extreme isolation.\nThe movie is very well laid out and features most of the songs on the album, and it's really great to have a visual representation (albeit an open-source one) that allows the viewers to draw their own conclusions.",

            "content": "*GREAT MOVIE*\n\nMusic has changed since 1982. In my opinion, it has changed in a very, very bad way: It lacks passion, to put it simply. It's also very repetitive and seems to be put out there, effortlessly, without a care in the world, for the sole purpose of making money. Is anyone still doing what they love when it comes to music? Does anyone have a message? \n\nWhen watching the 1982 rock opera \"Pink Floyd The Wall\", I thought to myself, \"wow, we will never see anything like this ever again.\" I think I can hold onto that statement until the day I die, and it will most likely still be true. \"The Wall\" was a 1979 Pink Floyd album which was later adapted into this movie, using their music, obviously. It was released at a time when musical artists were still worthy of being called musical artists. It was also at a time when music served as a larger part of society, a time when music always had a message.\n\n\"Pink Floyd The Wall\" is about a lot of things. It's about embracing inner expression, issues with education, and makes many more strong political statements. If you're a fan of Pink Floyd, well, that just helps. The music, in my opinion, is fantastic. I'm a fan of Pink Floyd, and have been for quite some time. It's haunting and almost spiritual, and the story told in this film is one of many complex levels with complex emotions. \n\nThe main character, a rockstar named Pink, sits in his hotel room in Los Angeles, thinking about the past and dwelling on his current problems while avoiding them. Less than half of the film consists of powerful and expertly designed animation. The animation in the film serves a bigger purpose than to entertain, like most Pink Floyd music does, and like the rest of the movie does, and unlike modern music does. \n\nPink dwells on his past; he thinks of his overprotective mother, his dad who died in WWII, the Missile Crisis, and the lack of freedom of expression in his school. In his current, drugged and numb state, he slowly goes crazy in his own mind, by himself. This is very powerful and imaginative stuff, especially when we know it's coming from the mind of Roger Waters. I don't think a time will ever come that I watch this film and I don't think to myself, \"what could this mean?\" Because \"Pink Floyd The Wall\" is one of those open-ended films that you'll always learn more and more about each time you watch it. \n\nDuring one of the scenes in Pink's childhood, we see children being led in a line, wearing the same face, being marched into a grinder. Pay attention to the lyrics: \"all in all it's just another brick in the wall.... We don't need no education.\" Not only is it haunting, but it's very powerful, and I believe it has been brought to life perfectly with one of the most powerful scenes in the movie. \n\nThe animation, like I said earlier, is masterfully made. Some of it is appropriately disturbing, some is haunting, some is bizarre, but all of it is powerful. For you to figure out is the true meaning behind all of it. I'm not entirely sure if it means something different to everyone, but I do know this: everyone will find something different when they watch it, whether it be personal feelings or altered understandings of each scene.",

Have you ever had a dream so outlandish that you know it could not have actually happened but you remember it like a real memory? That nightmare is Alan Parker's Pink Floyd's The Wall. This movie is the closest I have ever seen to an actual nightmare. This movie was quoted as being the most unpleasant experience of Alan Parker's life, it caused much tension between Roger Waters and the rest of Pink Floyd and Roger Waters did not like the end result. Although all of this is unfortunate for those involved, what came out of this misery was a fantastic film. The almost complete lack of dialogue, the excellent usage of Pink Floyd's captivating album, and the surreal animation sections of the film makes this film a visual and auditory experience. The film hits the themes of the aftermath that war left on people and Britain, corrupt teachers (excellent and infamous \"Another Brick in The Wall Part 2\" scene), marriage, fascism as an allegory for fame, and the events in life that snowball into human isolation; the building of The Wall. I pulled a one nighter (new term I made up) and listened to the whole album of The Wall then watched the film. I expected disturbing, screwed up, and rock and roll fueled anger and sorrow and I did get it, but one emotion I did not expected accumulated from this listening and viewing; sadness. Both the film and the album are practically the story of a man secluded himself from everyone and it is a very alienating and depressing experience. Through all of the violent imagery and all out bizarreness, there is a deep human message at the center-most brick of The Wall. That is why it seems like a plausible nightmare. The Wall is not always easy to watch and most won't even like it, but it is hard to admit that it is not oddly fascinating.\n\nUltimately everything about this movie surprised me. The direction, the animation, the narrative, the cinematography (incredibly ahead of it's time); all amazing!!! One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the performance as the troubled rock star and protagonist, Pink, by Boomtown Rat's Bob Geldoff. Geldoff was not an actor. He did not like Pink Floyd. He could not be more different than Pink (in fact, violence makes Geldoff sick) but casting Geldoff for some weird reason, was genius. Geldoff pulls off a convincing, wordless performance as Pink.\n\nFinal tidbit: Although I am a lover of film, I tend to get easily distracted by social media and other things during films. I did not pause this film once. For better or for worse, it hooks you in the whole time. Once you start building', there is no way back.",

As you'd expect, this is basically Pink Floyd's album \"The Wall\" as a feature film, complete with most of the tracks, though sometimes, they changed the order in which the songs are played. I can't help but think that changing order in which the songs are played kind of messed up the context of the story. There's little to no dialogue in the entire movie, and no, David Gilmour's singing voice doesn't count. On the one hand, this means there's no bad acting, but without any dialogue, there's almost nothing stringing the plot along besides the music and imagery. Ultimately, my biggest criticism of this movie is that you have to have listened to the album first in order to get it, and sometimes I still don't, and actually listened to the full album. It's not all bad. Gerald Scarfe's animation sequences are really good, providing inventive, rich imagery to the film. However, the only thing that would be better is if the entire film were animated. It's not that bad, but it seems rather inconsistent. In layman's terms, I'd stick to the album.",

            "content": "Only a complete simpleton would at this point in time argue Pink Floyd's The Wall isn't a classic album, the music is undeniably incredible and indeed one of the greatest records in rock history. Some, though not I, may even argue it was the high watermark for the legendary band as they finally exploded into epic rock opera territory with a double LP telling a distinct and clearly personal story. Where the need for commentary and discussion comes into play here is how necessary it was to turn such a dense and narrative heavy album into a film in the first place, especially since the film not unreasonably actually cuts out material from the album despite running an average hour and a half in length. The film has since its release only been a modest cult hit, developing a devoted following especially in recent years but being divisive and downright ignored by most upon its release. Still with Roger Waters writing the film itself, Alan Parker lending his customary insane visuals, illustrator and frequent Floyd collaborator Gerald Scarfe providing the animation and music industry legend Bob Geldof starring as Pink surely this movie couldn't have gone but so wrong? Well let's take am up against the wall look.\r\n\r\nThe film adheres strictly to the music and tells the tale of presumably autobiographic cult rocker Pink Floyd (Geldof) an emotionally stunted and disturbed drug addict on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Pink grew up under the reign of an overbearing single mother (his father died in the war), an oppressive regime of teachers and a total sense of isolation from other children which leads to his fractured mental state. Finally one night he snaps, attacks a groupie, decimates his hotel, shaves all the hair off his body and barricades himself in the room the night before the show. When his greedy manager (Bob Hoskins) finds him in a near catatonic state he forcibly revives him with uppers and forces him on stage causing Floyd to totally snap. He begins playing the part of a genocidal dictator and promotes views of hate and intolerance causing riots of hate crimes throughout England. He is eventually thrown in a mental asylum where he must either live out the rest of his life or confront and tear down the wall his childhood has caused him to build around himself.\r\n\r\nI almost don't want to delve into the story itself, this is a classic album and its power and quality speaks for itself. The music is incredible, the lyrics powerful even more than thirty years later and its a thematically devastating and powerful story. I like so many others could not love the ALBUM more from how effectively and yet with so little information it builds the character of Pink, how gut wrenchingly it connects with the feeling of loneliness even when you're adored by millions and living the dream without being self pitying and over indulgent and I've always loved and defended how Pink's fate once his outer wall is brought down is never revealed. But if this was just essentially going to be an hour and a half music video of the whole album I'd want more or less nothing to do with it I have my own images of what it should look like in my head. So thankfully it's not. It goes above blandly portraying the story by also providing stark visuals and showing dramatized scenes from Roger Waters childhood that enrich and add to our preexisting knowledge of the story. The film is a powerful supplement to the album that also serves as a stand alone abstract film and musical and rather than trying to further cash in on the album's success actually tries to provide even more to it. This could have gone horribly wrong and is I think a little to abstract and reliant on the viewer being knowledgeable and well versed on the album but as a whole it ends up being a top form success aided by different interpretations of many of the songs, some insanely creative and stylized animated sequences and Geldof's ballsy and bare all performance. The end result is a passionate exploration further into the recesses of Water's and the rest of the artist's psyche that still holds up today.\r\n\r\nI think the movie and album wonderfully exist separately and on their own terms and can be enjoyed individually each in their own right but nonetheless they strengthen each other in a wholly unique to create an ultimately stronger product together. Some highlights include the nightmarish vision of life during the Battle of Britain in the animated sequence accompanying \"Goodbye Blue Sky\", the children being fed into the societal machine in \"Another Brick in the Wall Part 2\", the visceral room trashing tantrum to \"One of My Turns\" and Hoskins Manager character getting him hauled from his comatose state onto the stage amid flashbacks to the album highlight \"Comfortably Numb.\" If you're a fan of emotional and unique film making and Pink Floyd you need to see this and if you could take of leave these things than you don't it's that simple.",
