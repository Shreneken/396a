First, as always, I must note an excellent movie bar, which after doing some research, availed itself to be a bar I've been to and love (the 7B Horseshoe Bar aka Vazacs, or simply, The Horsehoe) ‚Äî this surprised me, for as much of the film takes place in Boston, a lot was shot in NYC. The watering hole is where Frank, our legal knight, frequents to tell dirty jokes with the usuals, play pinball, and occasionally drop a raw egg into a glass of beer. The conflict arises when Frank is given a medical malpractice case as a favor from an old friend and biz partner (Jack Warden), which is set to settle for a pretty sum, if only Frank doesn't have a change of heart, hides the offer from his clients (a big no-no), and loses his star witness to‚Ä¶ vacation? You can imagine where the plot goes from here. Despite the system being against him (the \"system\" here being a judge with a ridiculous haircut and an army of corporate lawyers), Frank conducts some shoe-leather investigations to beat the insurmountable odds. Frank's iron will is commendable, but he commits at least two counts of malpractice, the first I already noted, the second coming when he didn't motion for a mistrial after the red-handed evidence of opposing counsel's (James Mason) ethical violations. Even though the jury finds in favor of our hero (and against all the weight of admissible evidence..) it still is unsatisfying because we never hear the awarded amount. I simply don't understand this. When there has been so much emphasis on the amount from the settlement negotiations, what Frank could've accepted for his clients and the cut for himself, when that amount seemed hopelessly lost, it was a shock that the script didn't include the amount in the namesake verdict. Like so many movies before really the past 10 years or so, we end with whether the romantic interest be tied up, in which, like usual, I don't care. Moreover, if Frank even contemplated continuing a relationship with Laura, I'd want to smash him over the head with his own beer glass. It's a solid legal drama, but with a few changes, could've been something special.",

Tossing Paul Newman in the lead role completed the trifecta as he grows into his character as this film progresses, ultimately delivering a memorable performance by deftly portraying the range of changing motivations and emotions his character underwent throughout this film.\n\nThere were times this felt like the type of Grisham courtroom thriller I grew up reading and I have always been a fan of this genre from a young age. There were also moments I felt this veering into unnecessary melodrama but thankfully these scenes never slowed the film down or took me too far out of the story. I also wasn't sure how keen I was on the last scene but should probably sit on that for a little while before declaring \"it didn't work for me\".\n\nJack Warden provided good support and is always a welcome sight in a cast for me. James Mason was also memorable as opposing council and Milo O'Shea deserves a mention as I found him extremely unlikable, a definite compliment, in his role as Judge Hoyle. 7.5/10",

            "content": "The Verdict is a really good movie with a few really unfortunate, glaring flaws. This film has a lot of solid twists, only a few of which can be seen coming. I was skeptical of the main character at first because he seemed like a cookie-cutter, alcoholic, down-on-his-luck, old white guy that I've seen in a hundred other movies. However, his redemption is nuanced, not forced, and he has a lot of natural character development that's satisfying to watch. Unfortunately, I found it very hard to connect with him near the end of the film as we are forced to literally watch him assault a woman under the guise of justice; it's distasteful and could have been handled so much better.\n\nThe trial itself, which takes up a good portion of the movie, is really engaging and rightly brings frustration to the bureaucracy and bias of the American justice system. It also felt very accurate to real-world courtrooms, although I'm no expert. The ending felt kind of off, though: I don't want to spoil anything, but there is a verdict at the end of the movie that doesn't feel in line with the legal evidence presented. It feels more like the verdict was chosen for an emotional response more so than as a result of the proceeding events. This was frustrating because the rest of the movie was incredibly detailed and technical.\n\nTo summarize, it's an imperfect movie but absolutely worth watching.",

            "content": "There's a moment in The Verdict, after the incriminating testimony of his surprise witness is ordered to be struck from the record on a technicality,  when Frank Galvin (Paul Newman) makes this last-ditch plea to the jury:  \"...there is no justice. The rich win; the poor are powerless. We become tired of hearing people lie. And after a time we become dead, a little dead. We think of ourselves as victims. And we become victims. We become weak. We doubt ourselves, we doubt our beliefs. We doubt our institutions. And we doubt the law. But today you are the law. You ARE the law.\" These words are as much a description of the lawyer's own tenuous, emotional state, as they are an entreaty to the jury to do the right thing. They are a sample of a spare but sparkling screenplay by David Mamet (American Buffalo, Glengarry Glen Ross) which resonates as much today as it did in 1982, as America prepares to vote during a pandemic with a brazenly authoritarian president in power.\n     Sidney Lumet's courtroom drama The Verdict is a quietly brilliant achievement. Paul Newman stars, at age 57, as washed up lawyer and alcoholic Frank Galvin. Unable to recover from the damaging events that ruined his standing as a reputable lawyer, he occupies his days in the same dreary haunts playing the same sad pinball machine, scouring funeral homes for legal leads, and sharing whiskey shots with a motley crew of pals at the pub. His loyal ex-partner Mickey (Jack Warden) passses him a malpractice case to help him out, and the story proceeds from there.\n     While the suspense elements and steady build up of the story are both intriguing and engaging, THE ONE THING that stays with me the most after watching this is the pitch-perfect mood of the film. Cinematographer and longtime Lumet collaborator Andrzej Bartkowiak casts the film in faded hues of brown and grey, matching Galvin's washed out existence. Newman's performance is low key and vulnerable, unlike anything else I've yet seen him in. All elements combine to create the portrait of a man in a moment of existential crisis. Will Frank be able to climb out of his comfortable but destructive routine? Will he find allies to help him uphold justice, or will people disappoint as they pursue only their own self-interest.\n‚Äã     The story is gripping because I can easily see myself in Frank. At any moment, a person's life can change. The moorings that provide meaning can slip out from under you, whether it be a job, a loved one, or a traumatic experience. The journey to recovery is an uphill battle, and to do it surrounded by doubters, as Frank is, can be terrifying. The film's ending is both triumphant and uncertain. On the one hand Frank has a victory, but on the other he is betrayed by someone he came to rely on. It is this open-ended ambiguity, rare in Hollywood films, that makes me like the movie even more. It keeps you thinking after the credits roll.",

Smokes. He's the hard-boiled type. It's Paul Newman, that strain of blue collar American man who earned his way to the top with grit. The story is a slow burn, slow build and sisyphean in it's determination, anchored by Newman's gravitas. The only real weakness is the female love interest, their relationship never taking hold in a way that feels substantial enough to earn the dividends Lumet and Mamet pay it in the final 3rd. With a worthwhile turn (spoiler -> she is working for the other side) but when she fails to authentically win back Newman's affections, we are left feeling vacant not because of their failure, but because as an audience we never understand enough about either of them to invest in their potential bond. A stoic performance from a young Charlotte Rampling, but behind the stone facade of her and Newman, we need more than just behavior and suggestion. For the early 80s it was enough of a B story and emotional foundation to build upon, but not quite enough for today. Nonetheless, the film holds up, the twists and turns keep us engaged and the final surge is a thrill. With strong support from James Mason (ole' Humbert Humbert) and a general trust put into performance though many masters and long takes, The Verdict will still win you over.",

            "content": "Sidney Lumet explored the importance of justice in American courtrooms with 12 Angry Men (1957) and twenty five years later he chose to produce another classic courtroom drama with The Verdict (1982). Fortunately the two films are very different as while 12 Angry Men largely confines it's action to one room and provides limited backstory for it's characters this is a film that employs the extensive landscape of Boston, Massachusetts and serves as an in-depth character study of a failed, alcoholic lawyer. I was particularly impressed by Paul Newman's performance as while I have found him to be a charming presence in other films he never struck me as a great dramatic actor but he proves himself to be absolutely riveting and capable of really carrying a film here.\n\nAlcoholic lawyer Frank Galvin, Paul Newman, had his once promising career ruined when he was framed for jury tampering early in his career, divorced his wife, was fired from his law firm and became addicted to alcohol. He gets one last chance at redemption when his friend Mickey Morrissey, Jack Warden, has him assigned to a case in which he will defend the sister and brother in law of a woman who choked on her own vomit and was deprived of oxygen during childbirth after being given anesthetic by negligent doctors which has resulted in her being left in a vegetative state. Against the advice of everyone around him Galvin chooses to try the case and attempts to put together a decent defense before going up against the formidable Ed Concannon, James Mason, who employs dirty tactics to argue his cases. Galvin also begins a relationship with fellow alcoholic Laura, Charlotte Rampling, who may not be what she appears and faces corruption in the form of a biased judge and the difficulty of his primary witness disappearing. With perseverance and commitment to the case Galvin is able to track down a crucial witness and bring compelling evidence forward.\n\nThe film doesn't follow all of the typical beats of a film of this sort as while we get the essential last minute introduction of crucial evidence and an impassioned speech from the protagonist there are moments of true inspiration here. No, I'm not just talking about the scene in which Newman unexpectedly punches Rampling but I will admit that I was surprised at seeing our hero hit his supposed love interest. The final, passionate speech was what really sold me on the film as it is comparatively restrained and thoughtful compared to the outbursts seen in ‚Ä¶And Justice for All (1979) and A Few Good Men (1992) which while entertaining are less emotionally moving than they should be. This quiet monologue fit Newman's character as he is a man who has been relentlessly beaten down by life and he doesn't have the energy to yell and scream. He gets his point across just as well speaking in a muted but clearly emotional tone which felt more realistic in addition to having a greater impact on the audience.\n\nLumet's direction cannot be undervalued as a story that could have felt like another episode of any number of television shows is elevated to the status of sophisticated drama as he builds tone and atmosphere without giving the audience any easy answers. The David Mamet screenplay also makes the film that much better than other films of this ilk as it provides characters with a simple, concise way of speaking that is able to reveal depths about their characters without making them seem too eloquent to believe. The film even looks beautiful, rare for a courtroom drama, as we are led through the various seasons and how they affect the climate in Boston while witnessing the havoc that alcoholism can wreak on one man's life. Finally, the performances are all top notch as Newman gives one of the finest performances of his career as a haunted man who still has that glint in his eye suggesting that he has the ability to be a great lawyer and possibly a redeemable human being. Mason is equally fine as our British villain who is menacing not because of a facial scar or his physical strength but his eloquence and unmatched abilities in the courtroom. Both men should have won Academy Awards for their work as they are quite brilliant and display that even late in their respective careers they still had more to offer.",

I suppose it was a great summation and he talked about the justice system being about the jurors, who represent the people.  But, I found it kind of unintentionally humorous that at the very end of his eloquent speech, he just drops his head, walks back to his seat, and you feel like his body language and the abrupt ending of the speech was saying \"why even bother.\"  Overall, I'd say don't even bother watching this movie.  Better court room dramas are A Few Good Men and of course the classic To Kill a Mockingbird.",

            "content": "A mature courtroom drama full of masterfully nuanced performances.\n\nSidney Lumet's The Verdict (1982) is a natural depiction of a lawyers fighting their case with or without ethics. Lumet returns to form in the courtroom after his classic 12 Angry Men (1957) with The Verdict. Lumet's smooth direction gives The Verdict a grounded quality. The problems are all gritty and down to Earth. The Verdict is as real down to the mundane aspects of the courts.\n\nDavid Mamet's script for The Verdict takes on corruption of judicial figures, corruption within The Catholic Church, miscarriage of justice, doctoral malpractice, and criminal negligence with a scathing critical lens from Lumet. All the issues within the judicial and medical industries are put on full display due to Lumet's careful camera placement and dedication to depicting good lawyer work.\n\nJohnny Mandel's score is a subtle composition of classical music that brings out the seedy darkness of the law world. He keeps it quiet until the score suddenly rouses into a moody accompaniment of sorrow around Paul Newman's failures as a lawyer.\n\nPaul Newman sheds his cool exterior to play Frank Galvin, who is the broken and defeated alcoholic lawyer on his last case. Newman is remarkably understated that makes The Verdict age well into a thoughtful piece on doing the right thing as a lawyer. Newman's closing statement speech is a neat choice of heartfelt honesty as he opts not to go for the impassioned speech declaring his client in the right. Newman instead keeps it classy and genuine that plays to pathos and emotions to do the right thing in the face of adversity. He made a logical and fair case and gave it his all in a performance you must see. Newman's stumbling around drunk is very fun as it is troubling, while Newman simultaneously establishes his character as the lawyer to root for in the end.\n\nOn the other hand, James Mason is phenomenal as the cheating lawyer with ghastly underhanded policies in his nuanced and calm performance as Ed Concannon. His villainy is present despite his charming persona. His careful politicking around reveals his cruel and unethical abuses of his office as a lawyer. Mason is brilliant as ever regardless of his older age. James Mason is the perfect foil for Paul Newman in The Verdict.\n\nJack Warden's supporting role as Mickey is as realistic and endearing as a portrayal of a friend and good lawyer as film gets. Milo O'Shea's irreverent and crooked Judge Hoyle is despicable and disturbing to watch his brazen abuses of his office.\n\nLastly, I must mention the young and lovely Charlotte Rampling in an incredibly complex role as Laura Fischer. Her moody personality and blunt speech makes Laura the ultimate femme fatale. Her character's twists are unpredictable as I did not see them coming. I especially appreciate the realistic ending Lumet chose for Newman and Rampling. Charlotte Rampling has always been an actress to watch and appreciate excellence in realistically nuanced acting. She is simply divinely blessed in her craft.\n\nI loved The Verdict for its lack of hand holding in how mature and respectful Lumet treats his audience. You follow the case exactly as Newman experienced every sudden hope and disillusioned crash. The courtroom has never felt so tense and uncertain as it exists within The Verdict!",

The Verdict is one of my favorite movies and its so interesting to see the life portrayed in 1982, its like another world compared to 2018. Smoking in airports, court houses and office buildings, a stranger freely approaching a pre-school teacher with her class, it all seems so strange. Paul Newman should have won the Oscar for Best Actor and James Mason the Oscar for Best Supporting actor. Everything about this movie is outstanding. Enjoy!",

He uncovers a legitimate injustice and struggles to accept a settlement, which effectively results in a cover-up of a major medical error. The case symbolizes his individual struggle to take badly needed easy money or to regain his professional integrity and peace within himself by bringing the case to trial. The story works well, and the internal conflict within the main character is clear and emotional. It picks up as the powerful opposition, his high-paid defense attorneys attempt to sway trial outcome with bribes and underhanded tactics. Watching him research and build his case is exciting. He knows he has a case, but his formidable opponent makes it difficult for him. It all builds to a climactic court scene. A drunk lawyer on the skids is a different type of role for the usually likable Paul Newman, but he pulls it off very well. His character has a conscious, but he is uncertain of himself. He knows he must defeat his internal conflicts in order to be the lawyer his clients need him to be. It is a very good movie, with the emotional backbone needed to leave a lasting impact.

He befriends Laura (Charlotte Rampling) who is budding a budding legal counselor and finds some hard truths. \n\nPaul Newman portrays a man in depression who sees no way up from the position he is in but wants to stick by some ideology he never followed through his career. So the basic character structure is quite inconsistent which is why I couldn't relate to it in the first place. Sidney Lumet is a master of screenplay with his superior '12 Angry Men' and 'Dog Day Afternoon', but never really gets going here with uneven pacing and misdirected direction occasionally. Performances are top-notch throughout. \n\nUneven pacing and unrelatable protagonist didn't work for me, but features an excellent performance by Paul Newman.",

Everything that happens before the trial begins is incredibly tasteless and uninteresting, and everything is showed in such an expository way, which makes it a chore to watch. None of the characters are likable, nevertheless all portrayed beautifully. The pacing is really off, it starts incredibly slow with some good moments, then it suddenly picks up in pace, drops in pace for like 15 minutes then picks up again, that makes it difficult to watch too. Also in the courtroom scenes, usually filled with great new characters that are put on the stand, surprising twists, intense argumentation, and exciting new info being uncovered. ---- The Verdict has none of those, it does have a beautiful monologue, that however felt completely out of place and meaningless because of it. On top of that when in the end the trial is obviously won (It's still a movie, that's obviously what will happen in any type of courtroom movie) you, as the audience, feel no compassion for the leading man, you dont feel happy for him, you dont feel happy/uplifted yourself, nor do you feel proud or empowered, like you usually do after a fantastic courtroom drama, take Sidney Lumet's other work, 12 angry men, for instance.\n\nAll in all The Verdict is a masterfully crafted piece of cinema (hence the 3.5 stars) but does lack emotional depth to keep the movie afloat.",

            "content": "Simply put, The Verdict features the finest work in the long, impressive career of Paul Newman. What he accomplishes in Sidney Lumet's 1982 courtroom drama is stunning. He plays a lawyer who carries a massive chip on his shoulder, and the results of the case he undertakes will determine whether or not he can pull himself out of the alcohol-filled abyss he finds himself in. He's not the most charismatic man-not by a long shot. But we really want him to succeed, to salvage himself, and to give his clients the justice they deserve.\n\nThe case Frank Galvin (Newman) accepts is a tricky one, though it doesn't have to be. A Boston woman turns into a vegetable after an oversight in the operating room. Her family thinks the Catholic hospital and the doctors on duty should be held responsible, and the hospital itself recognizes its error, offering a big check to keep the case out of court. But Frank can't accept. Not only does he think the plaintiffs deserve more, but he needs to renew his faith in the legal system and himself. After rejecting the offer, however, Frank begins to think he's made a big mistake. The woman's family is furious with him, the opposing attorney (James Mason) is a shark, and his colleague (Jack Warden) doubts Frank's instincts and doesn't think he can stay sober long enough to get through the trial.\n\nWhile there's no denying that Newman is the main attraction here, the film has a lot of other things going for it. Sidney Lumet's direction is as assured as ever. The pacing is deliberately slow, which takes it out the thriller category so many legal films fall into. Another thing I noticed is that there's virtually no non-diegetic sound, which I thought really helped me stay involved in the plot and the characters. It's a risky choice because music does a lot of the heavy emotional lifting for many films, but The Verdict loses nothing without it. In fact, leaving it out probably makes the film better.\n\nI've spoken to Newman's brilliance already, but seriously, the guy conveys more emotion and meaning with a simple glance than most actors can in an entire movie. Really take in the scene in which he visits his comatose client in the hospital and decides to take the case to trial. Not a word is spoken-all you hear is the rhythmic sound of a breathing machine-yet it's at that moment that our lead character makes a life-altering choice, and we totally believe it.\n\nI definitely wouldn't say Newman's work is matched by that of his supporting cast, but there are many good performances to be found in the film. Charlotte Rampling plays Laura Fischer, Frank's new girlfriend who helps him through his pre-trial lows. Her subplot felt a little underdeveloped for a while, but late in the film, she breaks out. The film's other attorneys, played by Mason and Warden, are also quite good. Mason has a juicier role as a truly conniving lawyer. Warden is strong as another of Frank's rocks, helping him stay strong when his past history would dictate another relapse.\n\nAnother aspect of The Verdict I enjoyed was the way it made you think about the legal system. It's neither pro-lawyer nor anti-lawyer, though it points out a number of positives and negatives. Several characters derogatorily refer to Frank and his colleagues as \"you people,\" saying that all lawyers are the same and that they have no problem gambling with people's livelihoods in order to make more money. It's a fair point, but we understand where Frank is coming from, also. He wants to do the right thing, and part of the reason he's so depressed and dependent on his alcohol is that he's lost a little faith in his profession.\n\nThere's virtually nothing wrong with this film. If I had any complaints it's that it doesn't really do anything out of the ordinary, but it's so well-directed and well-written that it's easy to forgive its familiarity. And Newman's performance is just incredible. If you ever need a reminder of why he's a legend, look no further than The Verdict.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/verdict-review/",

Paul Newman is amazing as a washed up lawyer who has been completely disenchanted by the law. They do a nice job of slowly developing his character throughout the film, and showing us why he is so frustrated with life. This setup also makes it even more affecting when we see shades of his past experiences threatening to make this new case just as miserable, particularly because he starts to care about his client more than he had cared about any case in years. I was getting annoyed by the seemingly tacked on and unnecessary romantic relationship, but they cleverly tie that in to the story so my complaint went away. Towards the end I found the proceedings in court became a little far-fetched, but if you're willing to buy the legal logic of the movies and can put your critical brain on hold it still works (although I imagine real lawyers are somewhat perturbed by what they see in this movie.) I think where the movie was the weakest was in the final resolution. They never have that celebratory moment you expect in a courtroom drama when the case is won and people rejoice because justice has been served. Instead they decide to scale things back and make the conclusion more character-focused instead of giving us that cathartic moment of joy. It's a small complaint, but I think I just prefer court films that keep the law as their centerpiece more than the lawyers. But the performances were good enough in The Verdict that I enjoyed it anyways.",

I mean, during the emotional scene she says to the guy, who's a nervous wreck at this point, \"I can't invest in failure, Frank, anymore.\" Who talks like that? Anyway, she didn't spoil the movie at all. \n\nThe story here is really great. The opening scene sets the tone for the rest of the film. It alternates suddenly from the noisy pinball machine to Newman sipping on a beer and having a cigarette in silence and very casual. The rest of the movie is like that. The story and Paul Newman's character shifts suddenly from anxious to calm to anxious again. One second he's in a panic, next second he's sitting in the dark with his head between his legs. The mood is consistent, though. And the ending is great. Everything comes full-circle. Newman got himself in this mess by making a decision on a whim; when he turned down the money and decided to go to trial, and his optimism is replaced with regret and dread in the very next scene. At the end of the movie things go from dark to sunny just as quick, and then it's over and it leaves you speechless. It's amazing how those in the legal system have so much power and they can enact it so readily. That further drives home the point that justice belongs in the hands of the jury. \n\nThe very last scene with the telephone is the cherry on top. It really shows how much stronger and more confident he is after all he's been through. A drastic change from the Newman we were introduced to at the start of the film.",

Along the way, he has to deal with what can best be described as \"Murphy's Law: the movie.\"\n\nThis isn't the best performance by Paul Newman. His voice is a little too raspy for too many stretches of the film, but there are moments where he does deliver, mainly in the trial scenes, which don't start until the movie is halfway over.\n\nNewman's opponent, described as \"the Prince of Darkness\", is played by James Mason, who gives the film's best performance. Despite his grandfatherly appearance, Mason does indeed live up to the nickname the film bestows upon him.\n\nNow we get to the film's problems. First, Lumet's directing is a tad off. There are a few awkward edits and scene transitions that are a tad too jarring. Most of the film is shot in a rather dull, lifeless way. The camera doesn't move a whole lot.\n\nHowever, the film's biggest problem comes from the title of the film itself: the Verdict. The verdict is supposed to play off as a surprise, but the problem is that nothing in the film leads to a plausible way for the surprise to work. There is not one point during the trial where one can go \"Newman's got a chance to win this.\" If we're supposed to believe Newman's big, Oscary speech was enough to sway the jury, then that just isn't good enough. There needed to be a little more going in Newman's favor.",

It still stands up today as a powerful drama. Set in Boston, lawyer Frank Galvin (Paul Newman) was once a top graduate of Boston College Law School and worked for a top legal firm in Boston. Now, he's down on his luck, an alcoholic and is what you'd call an ambulance chaser. His former colleague and old friend Mickey (Jack Warden) gives him a medical malpractice case out of sympathy. It seems like an open and shut case, with a quick settlement expected and a source of income for Galvin. But the more Galvin looks into it, he unearths a web of lies and skulduggery with a woman in a coma. He's put up against the hospital's top lawyer  Ed Concannon (James Mason) as well. It's very well made with good dialogue and some familiar faces in the cast including Charlotte Rampling and Milo O'Shea, but Newman gives an assured and world weary performance as the has-been lawyer. It was tipped as a top Oscar contender, but it was put up against Gandhi (1982). Oh, well...",

            "content": "If there ever was such a thing as the prime movie star, his name would be Paul Newman.  It's extraordinarily rare to have an actor as handsome, talented, and timely as Newman, and The Verdict is set in stone as proof as to why his name alone has been immortalized in the same way as Elizabeth Taylor or Orson Welles.  But unlike the latter two, Newman didn't have a certain set of \"years\" where he was at his prime - for certain, Taylor was a fixture of the '50s and '60s, only retaining interest later on through her personal life rather than her acting abilities, with Welles keeping his name intact only through a handful of films, sporadically placed, however extraordinary.\n          What Newman did that was so different from every star of his day was that there was never a time where he wasn't appealing, where he wasn't able to capture audiences of differing decades.  47 in The Verdict, Newman serves as a compelling basis for what eventually proves to be a character study, a role that he was born to play.  As Frank Galvin, we are forced to examine what lies beyond his magnetic blue eyes and delve deeper into his inner psyche, a task that proves to be much harder than we originally think.  \n          Galvin was once a successful lawyer, but when he got a divorce, he turned to booze to drown his sorrows - graying and embittered, Galvin has no clients or prospects to push his life forward; until a middle-classed woman walks in with a perfectly good case: her sister was given the wrong anesthetic during birth, and as a result, has lost the baby and is dependent on life support.  The few people in his life remind him that he has a huge chance towards winning, but the case isn't necessarily the problem.  Galvin's problem is that he has not represented anyone for years, and his alcoholism has made any task more difficult to do when sober.\n          The title of the film may be The Verdict, but it's not infatuated with the courtroom, as it might suggest.  It would rather spend time with Galvin alone, in his office, with his best friend (the always dependable Jack Warden), or with his love interest (Charlotte Rampling, who carries an enigma that pulls us towards her).  As Galvin attempts to piece his life back together while having an explosive case on his mind is highly riveting, with a naturalness that could only be carried by a director like Sidney Lumet, who makes sure each moment is compiled together properly instead of speeding things up to get to the climax in time.\n          But The Verdict is a showcase for Newman, plain and simply - it's an understated performance, and his restraint is what makes Galvin such an excellent character.  He goes from living as a man who could care less, one that could be insulted and be much too tired to even blink an eyelash, to one who begins to realize that what he does for a living makes him more vital than he could ever imagine.  \n          The ambiguous ending, however, causes us to question whether or not he has turned over a new leaf and become the comeback kid, leaving his troubles in his wake, or if he once again has been let down just enough to send him spiraling down again.  In the closing scene alone, Newman is astonishingly able to combine every angel and demon Galvin retains without saying a word. \n          The Verdict is a film that is even better when it has no words to speak with - it's one that is perfectly comfortable with studying a person instead of only allowing us to judge them through their actions.  And frankly, you cannot ask for a better assortment of characters to breathe through.",

Needless to say it is a lopsided trial, Frank and his aid-cum-mentor Mickey (Warden), whose plaintiff is a woman in a vegetative state, versus two cocky defendants (both well-respected doctors) and their stellar defense team, led by a top-notch attorney Ed Concannon (Mason). \n\nApart from his omni-competent opponent, Frank has to endured\b\b a worst-case scenario during his rushed preparation for the trial, the disappearance of a key witness, an uncooperative insider, a maledictory judge (O'Shea), a questionable deponent (Seneca), a hostile client (the plaintiff's brother in law) who takes umbrage at Frank's arbitrary turndown of a handsome settlement from the defendant for their medical negligence. And it is a miracle he could still squeeze some time to have a fling with a mysterious divorc√©e Laura (Rampling). \n\nThings will nonetheless turns to a rosy side for Frank, as his trials and tribulations will eventually pay off, which doesn't prevent one from sensing frustration to witness all the paddings before a bleak light of hope comes to the rescue, a dogged Frank fortuitously grabs a clue lead to a game-changer in the accident, but meanwhile an unexpected betrayal is the last blow to complicate the case. And the ending with an prolonged and irritating ringing of the telephone, does certify a stark love-or-hate stance for its audiences.  \n\nHowever, Newman is impeccable here, he is a pampered child living in an adult's body, strives for his last chance to revive his life, a salvation of his ill-fated past, during the taxing process, he also begins to examine himself, to overcome his weakness (a terrific rendition of a panic attack) and reflect his goodness from the pestilent barriers around him and around us too, one long-take of him making a phone call with his adversary manifests Newman's top-tier stretch in bringing authentic force of emerging into his character. \n\nPreciously, the film is not an outward feel-good film, Rampling's stern-cum-icy presence and Laura's underdeveloped storyline mars the narrative but at the same time mirrors Frank's own rite-of-passage, so we might not feel much relieved when at the end of the day he won the case, it intrigues us more after the victory, what is next for Frank? \n\nJames Mason is Oscar-nominated along with Newman and the film in toto seized five nominations (including BEST PICTURE and DIRECTOR), his malevolent silver-tongue and smug sanctimony is spot-on, a paradigm of the miasma of our legal system. But Warden in my opinion is also Oscar-worthy, restrained yet faithfully being a helping hand and a firm buttress for both Frank and the spectators!",

Slick, powerful and confident his character is as far removed from Newman as it is possible to be. The clash between the two is more akin to a game of chess than a battle and it feels all the more powerful for that.

Paul Newman's performance is excellent, though it quite deliberately lacks the sort of scruffy charm of many of his earlier performances. Charlotte Rampling is severe as the woman the lawyer unwisely falls in love with, and James Mason's particular brand of genteel disdain makes for an opposing counsel you don't mind rooting against, even though he's not a total mustache-twirling villain. The movie was written by David Mamet, but very early on in his career, before he had perfected his signature style. It was directed by the underrated Sidney Lumet, and while it's not one of his best movies on the level of Network or 12 Angry Men, it's still a solid testament to Lumet's skill with serious and potentially dry subject matter. If it isn't the most rousing of courtroom movies, the downbeat ending does feel very realistic and appropriately unsentimental.",

            "content": "Frank Galvin (Paul Newman), a once-promising trial lawyer for an elite Boston law firm, is near the end of his career.  And he's on a losing streak that would make Lionel Hutz blush.  He's lost four cases in a row over the last three years and he's afraid that he would end his legal career on such a down note.  Frank Galvin was once a partner at a prestigious law firm, but was forced to resign from the firm after allegations of jury tampering surfaced.  Somehow he was never disciplined by the bar association let alone indicted for that serious crime (It turns out he was, \"Accused.  Not indicted.\"), but Galvin's career quickly took a downturn...\n\nFrank Galvin has been working as a solo practitioner for the past several years, desperate to take any cases that come his way.  He's described as an ambulance chaser, somebody who cares not about the people except for their wallets.  To really demonstrate how low Galvin has sunk, we see him attending funerals, pretending to be a \"friend\" of the decedent.  He then passes out cards to the mourners at the funeral.  He's obviously only interested in drumming up business for himself and is unaware of his insensitive actions.  Yeah, sounds like desperation to me.  Lawyers sometimes have a reputation for a lack of scruples and Frank Galvin doesn't do much to shatter that stereotype.  With his career in the doldrums, Galvin spends much of his time hanging out at the bar, playing a pinball machine, and drinking booze in order for the time to pass by quickly...\n\nGalvin operates from a dingy office and he's barely making ends meet.  He's struggling to afford paying his office rent for crying out loud!  Frank's only real friend is his former partner and mentor, Mickey (Jack Warden) who sees how much Frank has hit rock bottom after seeing him passed out drunk on his office's couch. \n\nMickey tells Galvin that he has worked hard to secure him a great case, a potential moneymaker.  However, it's been about eighteen months since Galvin was supposed to be working on this case and Galvin hasn't done so much as even meet with his client.  And Galvin has court in just ten days.   \n\nGalvin meets with Sally Doneghy (Roxanne Hart), the sister of his client, Deborah Ann Kaye.  It turns out that Deborah is suffering from brain damage and is currently in a coma.  What happened was that Deborah went to the St. Catherine Laboure Hospital in Boston to deliver her third child.  However, she was allegedly given the wrong anesthetic by the doctors and now is fighting for her life.  She is barely kept alive as she is breathing through tubes connected to a medical ventilator...\n  \nGalvin hasn't exactly been putting forth a lot of effort on this case.  He just wants a quick settlement and boom, it's over.  Get it done and over with and earn a nice windfall in the process.  But when he actually sees the comatose woman and the vegetative state she is in, Galvin experiences a powerful epiphany.   \n\nFor Galvin, this is a big time medical malpractice case with significant ramifications.  It turns out the St. Catherine Laboure Hospital is owned and operated by the Archdiocese of Boston.  And the Bishop of the Archdiocese has set up a meeting with Frank Galvin in an attempt to resolve this case expeditiously and amicably, which could be beneficial for both sides.  \n\nAt the meeting, the Bishop offers Galvin a handsome settlement in the amount of $200,000 if he agrees not to pursue the case any further.  But going against the wishes of his client's family, Galvin, being the maverick that he is, rejects the settlement offer.   Galvin has always been scared to go to court and try cases.  But he decides to put everything on the line and take this case to trial.  This case has become personal for Galvin.  Because Galvin learns that it's not about money, it's about principle and doing the right thing.  Maybe he will emerge victorious.  Maybe he will find what he's capable of doing.    \n\nThe Archdiocese however has some considerable legal firepower of its own.  The defense attorney representing the Archdiocese in this matter is Ed Concannon (James Mason), who is described by Mickey as the \"Prince of Fuckin' Darkness.\"  He has all the financial resources and manpower of a major law firm behind him.  Concannon is also not above using below-the-belt legal tactics like bribing witnesses.    And the judge presiding over this trial is Judge Hoyle (Milo O'Shea), who during a pretrial conference in chambers, not very subtly encourages Galvin to take the settlement offer and run.  For whatever reason, Judge Hoyle isn't particularly enamored with Galvin and will do what he can to make the trial an unpleasant experience for Galvin  And a lot of things which could go wrong for Galvin before trial, do.  \n  \nGalvin's only semblance of a love life is Laura (Charlotte Rampling), whom he sees regularly at the local bar.  The two meet and strike a conversation, and soon enough, the two develop a close relationship.  Like Galvin, Laura is herself divorced, only her ex-husband is a lawyer.  She is also one of the few who believes in what Galvin is doing and his righteous cause.    \n\nGalvin must go up against the might and power of the Archdiocese.  Maybe then, can Galvin earn the self-respect that has for so long eluded him.  Could Frank Galvin finally live up to his full potential as a trial attorney?   \n\nThe Verdict is one of the finest courtroom dramas I have ever seen.  On one hand, it's a classic David vs. Goliath story about one man going up against a powerful institution.  And that man can really earn a name for himself if he slays Goliath.  On the other hand, it's about this lawyer standing up for justice as a way of redeeming himself after years of floundering and hard drinking.  It's really a powerful tale about a broken-spirited trial lawyer on a personal path to redemption.  \n\nThe Verdict is one of my favorite movies.  It's real.  It's honest.  It doesn't glamorize the legal profession or put lawyers on a pedestal.  It shows the day-to-day struggles of a lawyer trying to stay afloat, barely making a living.  It shows some of the desperation tactics lawyers do to try to make business or at least keep their names out there.  If anything, this movie may scare people off from wanting to go to law school and become lawyers.  For those who had fantasies about lawyers making big bucks and driving the latest brand name cars, this movie will demolish those illusions.  \n  \nIn addition to being a superb legal drama, The Verdict also examines many interesting concepts of jurisprudence.  Often times, there are competing interests between lawyers and the courts.  The courts are interested in moving the case along smoothly and quickly while lawyers have a responsibility to zealously represent and advocate for their clients.  There are also the popular themes of integrity and morality and how they intermingle in the judicial system.  Integrity to the courts means that cases move through litigation without any hiccups.  Some worry that the integrity of the judicial system can often be compromised by human emotions.  These emotions can cause people to go against the established rule of law.  \n\nSo what happens when an attorney feels that opposing counsel or even the judge himself is not playing fair?  Here, Galvin is driven by a sense of morality, to stand up against the bullies of not just the Archdiocese, but even the court system.  But both the Archdiocese and even the judiciary have tried to make a mockery of Galvin.  That Galvin is a fool for wasting the court's time taking this to trial.  Taking frivolous cases like this to trial compromises the integrity of the judicial system.  The pressure to \"cave in\" whether it is having a criminal defendant cop a guilty plea or pushing a plaintiff to settle a civil action case in order to maintain the integrity of this judicial system is one of the challenges that lawyers face, particularly if the lawyer is perceived as an \"outsider\" or has a seemingly unwinnable case.  But our emotions and our morals make these lawyers feel that some cases no matter how tough they seem are worth taking the opposing counsel (and the court) to task.   Here, Galvin's sense of right and wrong prevents him from toeing the line.  Ultimately, his personal feelings about this case have allowed him to make the right judgment call.  \n      \nOne of the more difficult challenges of being a trial attorney is not letting those same personal feelings get in the way of your professionalism.  All of the above means nothing if an attorney cannot at least act as a professional.  Sometimes, you feel very strongly about a case, but your personal life shouldn't mingle with your client's.  An attorney can be passionate about a case, stand firm in their position, and try to deliver justice, but an attorney is also bound by the rules of courtroom decorum.  An attorney has to look credible in court for the sake of public perception.  Of course all this can be cumbersome when it seems like your adversary is not playing by the rules, which is what Frank Galvin experiences the hard way.  You see Galvin biting his lip for too long and then lashing out at what he perceives as unfair treatment towards him and his client.  In short: you can be outraged at the system, but look professional showing your indignation.  While The Verdict explores what integrity means in the court system, there is also the issue of personal integrity.  An attorney must have that personal integrity in order to maintain their trust with their clients.  Frank Galvin makes the mistake of letting it slip and almost losing it completely which nearly costs him.    \n   \nAs lawyers, we are not just representing individuals; sometimes we are representing causes as advocates of justice.  We take on controversial cases because we want to make a difference, maybe even enact social change.  That's one of the more fascinating facets of Frank Galvin and plays an integral part of his character arc.  In the beginning, Galvin was simply worried about keeping his head above water.  But as he becomes more involved with the case against the Archdiocese, Galvin finds his personality changing into a more hard-charging lawyer that he was born to be.  All it takes is one look at the comatose woman and the condition she is in to galvanize him into action.  \n\nAnybody who has been a practicing trial attorney can appreciate this movie and can relate to Frank Galvin's experiences.  Galvin goes through the stress of potentially losing a big case.  It's not just money that's at stake; it's his name and reputation.   Because the latter two are often times the only things you have as an attorney.  I like how Frank Galvin is sometimes shown as being unprepared and overwhelmed, at times stumbling through his performance.  He makes mistakes, embarrasses himself in front of the judge, and even has the judge berate him in open court.   Of course, Judge Hoyle himself doesn't make it easy for Galvin.  There's this one great scene where the judge is constantly interfering with Galvin during his direct examination of his expert witness.   The judge decides to butt in and question the witness himself, flustering Galvin.  It really shows the uneasy tension between the plaintiff's lawyer and the judge.  The judge's job is to be a referee and not a participant and one can see how he has crossed that line, much to Galvin's frustration.     \n\nThe Verdict does a good job of capturing the adversarial nature of the courtroom and how some of the acrimony goes beyond what is said on the record.  Galvin navigates the labyrinth of the court system facing many obstacles.  His dogged persistence is what keeps him going.  Standing in his way is Concannon, who is always well prepared for battle and is highly intelligent.  Not to mention he probably has most of the judiciary on his side thanks to his hobnobbing.  Concannon knows how to shred witnesses on the stand and destroy their credibility right in front of a jury.  He can find the weaknesses of any case and penetrate them.      \n\nFor a hero to truly triumph, he must defeat a powerful villain.  Superman has his Lex Luthor, Batman has his Joker, and Galvin has his Concannon.  Concannon makes for a terrific bad guy, whether he is attacking the credibility of witnesses on the stand or making snarky remarks about Galvin's legal abilities or the validity of his case.  The two make for a fun match up.        \n\nOne of the most crucial aspects of being a trial lawyer is preparing your witnesses.  But if you can find your witnesses and get them to cooperate with you, you've won half the battle.  Here, Frank Galvin has a hell of a time just locating witnesses.  Even when the witnesses do show, getting them to cooperate is a whole another story.  And one very critical witness just disappears on Frank like that. \n\nOne improper thing Frank Galvin did from an ethical standpoint was failing to consult with the client's family before turning down the settlement offer.  The family finds out about this and is furious at Galvin for having rejected the settlement offer without consulting them at first.  In real life, it is actually not the lawyer's decision whether to accept or reject an offer.  It is the client's decision as to where he wants to go with the case; the attorney merely dictates the strategy.   The attorney has to respect their client's decision and if the client wants to resolve or settle, the attorney must listen to them.  \n\nMost lawyers you see in the movies dress impeccably and drive luxury cars.  Frank Galvin dresses in a way that I don't even want to know where he purchased his clothes from.  Maybe he obtained them as a donation from the local Salvation Army.  \n\nI won't spoil the details here, but Frank Galvin's summation is one of the best I have seen in any legal drama.  You can see Galvin pouring his heart and soul into this case, and Galvin tells the jury how much this case means to him, not just on an individual level, but on a much greater, public policy scale.  Because it is not just one person's life at stake, it's the entire justice system.  How a jury renders its verdict will impact justice on a macro level.  It will impact which laws are seen as valid, and which laws are antiquated.  It will impact what laws politicians will advance and which laws they will fight against.  The politicians, from the local representatives to people working in the state and nation's capital, help write the bills and pass the law.  The authorities regulate and enforce the law.  But it's the people who have the final say as to which laws are fair and just.  \n\nPaul Newman nails it as Frank Galvin.  His performance is perfection.  It is because of Newman's craftsmanship that Frank Galvin is a cogent and well-developed character.  The Academy Awards screwed up here.  Paul Newman really deserved the Oscar win for his superlative performance in this movie.  Although Paul Newman is ably supported by an excellent cast, Newman really shines in the spotlight.\n\nThere is hardly any action in this movie.  It is all dialogue.  And if anything, The Verdict feels like a stage play.  But the script by David Mamet is so well-written that the time passes by rather quickly.  And the performances are top notch.  Yes, Paul Newman carries the bulk of the weight, but the supporting cast is fantastic and Newman interacts very well with the actors.  Jack Warden does a great job as Galvin's mentor who is looking out for his well-being.  Warden's character is very sympathetic to Galvin, but sometimes he has to put his foot down, or rather, put his foot up Galvin's arse.  I enjoyed James Mason as the cocky, sleazy defense lawyer battling wits with Newman's underdog hero.  Mason really makes his character out to be a snake and he seems to takes pleasure in doing that.  Milo O'Shea gives a solid performance as a judge on a power trip.  Charlotte Rampling adds a layer of stern compassion in her role as Frank's love interest, Laura, who serves as Frank's social contact with the outside world.     \n  \nFrom a technical standpoint, the film looks great.  Director Sidney Lumet makes sure that the actors know what they are doing, but otherwise doesn't interfere.  He allows the actors to be themselves and deliver great performances.  But it's not just the dialogue; it's also the quiet moments that count.  Like the scene in the beginning where Galvin is staring at the local newspaper, checking the obituaries while having an alcoholic beverage.  Or when Galvin is about to take a third Polaroid picture of the comatose patient but then stops himself.  He observes the woman for several seconds, not saying a word, but his eyes speak for themselves.  We then get a view of the two other Polaroid photos with the images of the comatose patient gradually coming into focus.  There is no music, no dialogue, just the constant sound of the breathing through the tubes and the ventilator machine pumping oxygen to keep her alive.  You can see how much this has affected Galvin.  As the photo images become more visible and the colors more distinct, it really drives home to Galvin the importance of what he is doing.  It's one of the most poignant scenes in this movie and is really pivotal to how Galvin sees this case.  He no longer sees dollar signs; he sees how much somebody's misfeasance has really destroyed another's life.  Overall, Lumet's direction helps to effectively convey the struggles Galvin is going through, whether self-inflicted or external circumstances.  \n\nThe one-two potent punch of Sidney Lumet's taut direction and David Mamet's sharp screenplay make The Verdict an exceptional film.  What I really like about this film is the realism and believability of the characters and the situations they are in.  The film strips away all the pretenses and shows what being a lawyer all is about.  It's a hell of a lot of work and the compensation isn't always great.    \n\nWhen one of Hollywood's most talented actors teams up with one of Hollywood's most renowned directors as well a highly respected writer, this is the masterpiece that results from their creative hard work.  The Verdict is required viewing for anybody who enjoys courtroom dramas, character studies, or inspirational stories which will have you rooting for the underdog.   Or for anybody who wants to see a screen legend at the top of his game, period.  It's a film worthy of the recognition it deserves.  The Verdict will keep your riveted throughout from the beginning until the jury's final verdict is rendered and afterward.",

            "content": "A fine courtroom drama featuring one of Paul Newman's best performances, Sidney Lumet's thought-provoking classic is essentially an underdog story that focuses on a washed-up, alcoholic lawyer, Frank Galvin, who is given one last chance to redeem himself by taking on a case that sees him go up against a Catholic hospital which was responsible for the death of a young mother and the paralysis of her newborn baby. The first half is essentially a character study and focuses on Galvin's desperate attempts to maintain his sanity and rehabilitate his already-crumbled reputation bolstered by Newman's trademark ability to make us warm to the character even though we are supposed to largely unsympathize with him for all his carelessness. As the film progresses into the trial, Galvin continues to warm to us and thoguh the case progressively looks unwinnable, in spite of Galvin's lucklessness, it is a trial that is not over until the verdict is revealed. This is not just a great film because of Lumet's direction or the Oscar-nominated performances of Newman and James Mason as the opposing lawyer, but also because of the various twists that occur throughout to the point that it is virtually impossible to guess what the outcome of the trial, so by the end of the film, what could have started as just an ordinary courtroom drama clearly becomes something special. Gandhi took home the Best Picture Oscar of 1982, but in my opinion, this should have been the clear winner.",

The man himself doesn't do too much wrong giving one of his better performances as a lawyer on his way spiraling down clinging on to the one case that drains his moral conscience. \r\n\r\nFrank Galvin (Paul Newman) a lawyer on the verge of financial and career crisis latches on to a case of medical malpractice against a prestigious hospital and rejects an offer for settlement though he doesn't have enough firepower to go for a trial against the will of the kin to the victim. He befriends Laura (Charlotte Rampling) who is budding a budding legal counselor and finds some hard truths. \r\n\r\nPaul Newman portrays a man in depression who sees no way up from the position he is in but wants to stick by some ideology he never followed through his career. So the basic character structure is quite inconsistent which is why I couldn't relate to it in the first place. Sidney Lumet is a master of screenplay with his superior '12 Angry Men' and 'Dog Day Afternoon', but never really gets going here with uneven pacing and misdirected direction occasionally. Performances are top-notch throughout.\r\n\r\nUneven pacing and unrelatable protagonist didn't work for me, but features an excellent performance by Paul Newman.",

            "content": "The biggest sheer pleasure of watching \"The Verdict\" is getting to savor three very talented people working at the absolute top of their game. Screenwriter David Mamet gives us a smart script filled with terrific characters are moments of brilliance that greatly elevate what could have been a very pedestrian story. Mamet uses the twists and turns that are his trademark but still manages to keep the movie grounded in reality. \r\n\r\nCourtroom dramas are a Hollywood favorite, but this one avoids all of the typical Hollywood trappings. Masterful director Sydney Lumet keeps the movie personal, and that's what keeps you watching. It's not so much about the huge court case as it is the personal struggle within its lead character, beautifully played by the incomparable Paul Newman. The film earned the veteran actor his sixth Academy Award nomination for his fearless, gutsy performance. He forgoes the good looks that helped make him a star to play a real person with real problems that you can see etched all over his face. Newman says more with his eyes and his body language than he does with his words in this picture.\r\n\r\nYou know the character's story without him ever having to open his mouth, and despite all of his faults you get behind the guy. You want to see him come out on top. Lumet could teach a lot of young directors something about the simple thrill of good storytelling. \"The Verdict\" is a powerful and moving film full of human drama as well as great performances and sharp writing. This is easily one of the best films of the year 1982.",

The film is based on the Novel written by Barry Reed, and nominated for five Oscars.\r\n\r\nA down and out alcoholic lawyer Frank Galvin (Paul Newman), whose better days are behind him, suddenly finds a case that falls into his lap that will earn him a significant paycheck - a settlement over a medical malpractice suit. Galvin is all set to take the settlement, but something inside of him is now thinking twice, and he realizes that he will not take the easy money. This is his one and last chance to remember what it is like to be a lawyer, and decides to move forward and go to trial against insurmountable odds. As the details of the case emerge during the trial, the once quick buy-out/make it go away case now becomes a matter of exposing criminal behavior, negligence, and injustice. Newman's performance is spectacular as a man struggling, and then pulling himself together after hitting rock bottom, and finding his way again. The final scene with Frank just letting the phone ring is fantastic.",

I watched it this evening, hoping that my perception of it last time was off... nup, I still found it underwhelming. It stars Paul Newman as a down on his luck lawyer who lands a medical malpractice case against a catholic hospital. Where he would ordinarily settle the case, take the money and run he has a moment of clarity and rejects the offer, opting to take the case to trial. He has little in his favour and works against the odds to fight for justice. It's pretty contrived stuff really and the film's saving grace is the performances. All players are really solid. It's a shame that it's a boring case with scarcely any excitement. While I prefer courtroom films to be believable, I still need a certain element of thrill to keep me invested in the story. I just didn't care for this case at all. In fact each time I have watched The Verdict I find myself distracted by the trivial crap going on around it... like, how many times people butt their cigarettes out on the floor without picking them up and trying to spot Bruce Willis and Tobin Bell at the back of the courtroom. One of the best legal films of all time? Hell no! That place is reserved for films like To Kill A Mocking Bird, Presumed Innocent, The Rainmaker, A Time To Kill, Amistad... etc... hell even LA Law trumps this.",

            "content": "The Verdict is one of the finest courtroom dramas ever filmed, the only reason I've given it less than the full stars is that the plot has some convenient points in its last act to provide a studio imposed 'happy ending' that border on cheap.  \n\nThe excellence is wall to wall, starting with a terse, brilliant script by David Mamet, a performance of passion and prefection from that great soul, star Paul Newman in autumnal late middle age, and superbly deft direction from one of the finest American directors who ever lived, Sidney Lumet.  It benefits from note perfect supporting perfomances from film icon James Mason, the teddy bear like,  truthful presence of the great Jack Warden, sleazy Irish Judge Milo O'Shea, and the mysterious love interest Charlotte Rampling.\n\nThe story is Newman, by fluke, getting a medical malpractice suit against a powerful law firm acting for the Catholic diocese who run the hospital where a healthy young woman is turned into a vegetable by negligent high profile doctors.  James Mason exudes power and smugness as the senior partner with his usual subtlety.  Newman is given the case by his colleage Jack Warden who has had enough of his friend's alcoholic negligence and wants to be done with him.  Charlotte Rampling is a stunning, almost ghost like presence who offer's Frank one last chance at love in his late years.  \n\nThe dreary color palette and gothic (Boston and New York pretending to be Boston) locations add to the melacholic atmosphere of broken down, end of his rope ambulance chasing lawyer Frank Galvin (Newman).   Music is minimal and close ups are used very sparingly.  \n\nGalvin's need for redemption is so palpable that any human heart watching this gut wrenching performance is made to care deeply that he succeeds.  Somehow, this 'need for redemption' trope, normally  a hackneyed cliche, which fails in so many similar movies of the recent era is as perfectly executed here, due to Mamet's economical, unsentimental use of words (look for Galvin's haunting jury summation) and Newman's self-effacing, brave emotional nakedness.  \n\nThis film grips for all of its two plus hours, and though it may look a little old fashioned to modern eyes, it is very rewarding viewing.  An almost pefect film.",

            "content": "The Verdict works well enough as an entertaining courtroom drama, but sometimes you want a film to go beyond the conventions of cinema as simple escapism. Sometimes you want it to bury its heals down unto the mud as the story moves along, feeling as though you are being given something more than frosting with no cake. To hell with it. Skip the cake, I want something hardier than that, I want meat and this is only frosting.\n\nI'm supposing that much of the blame, or acclaim (however it is you view the picture), belongs to the director, Sidney Lumet, who, earlier in his career gave us such interesting stories as 12 Angry Men and Dog Day Afternoon. Both films accentuating the character more than the mundane plot devices which were meant by the writers to propel the celluloid at full speed. Both had a sense of justice --  one more orthodox than the other, but justice nonetheless. Here we have another story of justice seen through the eyes of a struggling alcoholic lawyer played for our sympathies by screen legend Paul Newman.\n\nI'm not going to trash on Newman, he's a fine actor, but not in this role. How can I say that when so many laud his performance as a masterful work of artistic brilliance in the face of cinema history. Easy, I just did. Instead of making the character interesting by keeping the guys losing qualities throughout the film, we are immediately handed plot point number one where our lawyer grows a fleshy heart after witnessing the state of his client (a comatose bed-bound vegetable who exists only by the grace of a life support machine). If I wanted to feel all warm hearted inside, I'll watch Sleepless in Seattle. It's as though the director and actors lost balls in the process of making this film and felt as though we had to perform a miracle and turn this guy into a saint if we were ever to get behind him and root him on to victory. When you look at it that way, it's simply a generic sports film in another arena.\n\nThe best character in the film was James Mason's rival lawyer, who appears to my eyes to be less of made up character and more of what you'd naturally expect from a working professional. I don't know about you, but if I'm going to trial for whatever reason, the guy who represents me, I want him to be the biggest, meanest, ugliest guy around and not someone who constantly has his nose buried in an ethics book (I know it's a horrible thing to say, but hey, do you want to win or don't you?).\n\nAs far as writer Mamet is concerned, this may be one of his lesser works, having little in the way of twists which we have come to expect from him, and more of a mainstream effort on his behalf. That being said, I cannot be completely sure as where to blame the author in this story. Mamet's direction is so sharp and quick witted, something sorely missed from Lumet's helming of this ship. I feel as though this might have not been the route which the writer would have taken the film, directotialy. I would like to have seen what he would have done with his own words in the stead of someone else.\n\nSo, when it comes down to it, is The Verdict a bad film? No. It was quite entertaining. But sometimes entertaining just doesn't cut it. Sometimes I want to chew on what I've been served and not simply swallow it down and have it pass through my system. There's a time and a place for desert. But please, not until after dinner.",

When his pal Mickey approaches him with a malpractice case, wherein a woman was suffers brain damage due to being given the wrong anesthetic, he takes it, confident he can win this \"easy\" case. The high-priced lawyers for the defendant, the archdiocese that runs the hospital, attempts to settle out of court with a reasonable sum, but Newman refuses. It then becomes a David vs. Goliath style battle. James Mason is wonderful as the corrupt, high priced, laywer who will do anything to win. Jack Warden as Paul Newman's buddy is wonderfully vulgar and lovable. Charlotte Rampling is stellar as Newman's love interest. But the real star is Paul Newman. He has wonderful performance. It is hard to imagine Paul Newman, with those dashing blue eyes, as unhappy, but watch Newman's expression when he is dealing with an unfair judge, and you will see the face of rage that rivals Al Pacino in the Godfather Part II when he finds out Kay had an abortion. I could also go on about David Mamet's wonderfully executed script and Sidney Lumet's masterful direction, but it speaks for itself. I highly recommend this movie.

On top of that, the judge is against him and his star witness is gone. Then there's another conflict that I didn't see coming and I don't feel one should know before watching the film. It seems throughout the whole movie that whenever Frank starts to make some headway something happens that pushes him back. It's his job to pull through and win this case. Not only for himself, but for the family of his client.\n\nUnlike many courtroom films, this always was understandable and more than that, it was always engrossing. Lumet never gets too wrapped up in the ins and outs of the trial process. He always sticks to the conflicts that plague Frank. The movie has tense scenes and but also many somber scenes that succeed because of just how good Newman is. This really is a must watch.",

Maybe it was the way he portray his character, that grungy feel to it were he is just drinking&smoking. It has this depressing mood into it but with an optimist feel. So in a way that is what the ending does, he made it work. It wasn't an amazing ending, maybe because most movie want the ending to end explosive and amazing. This ending was just like real life, life moves on when victory settles but with a pondering state of mind. What happens next...",

            "content": "After reading Lumet's book, one can see how much prudent precision goes into every single shot, scene, and sequence. The Verdict is the epitome of this claim. We are involved with a drunkard-attorney who has nearly hit rock bottom with his practice in shambles, wife divorced, and his reputation as \"an ambulance chaser\" at its apex. The opening pinball sequence (while sipping on a beer) acts as a foundation to a film about playing games and the consequences of losing your discipline. From the red-lettering to the transitioning transitions (soft dissolve to sharp cutting) to the unrelentingly immaculate crane shots and painstaking framing, The Verdict is a technical masterpiece. The denouement delivers audience satisfaction in regard to morals and even our newly reengineered protagonist who has nonchalantly switched from booze to coffee. And the endlessly ringing phone symbolizes the omnipresent force of former vice, which Newman abnegates without breaking a sweat. As the credits roll, a viewer comes to terms that despair is a bitch, esp. when it's self-induced, but it usually takes arduous resilience to reach heights again. But it is so so sweet once you arrive there.",

            "content": "\"The Verdict\" isn't Paul Newman's best film, but it was a great role for him.  My biggest criticism of courtroom dramas is that the research process moves slowly and things don't pick up until they are in court.  This film is guilty of that pattern but those slow parts give Newman a chance to really act.  To compliment the successful career of Newman, 2-time Oscar winner Jack Warden is cast as his partner, creating another memorable role.  Finally, Charlotte Rampling was the highlight of the film for me as makes this film about more than what happens in the court room.  The film has a very unexpected twist which adds to the heartless portrayal of the justice system and the trail unfolds with unexpected discord.  I can't rate it as high as \"A Few Good Men\" but \"The Verdict\"s gritty questioning of the fairness of the justice system gives Paul Newman another chance to portray the down-and-out drunk character with excellence once again.",

Most of the time they are reacting to the powerhouse performance by Newman, who really does a great job of showing his character's transition and only bolsters the point that he is one of the greatest actors in the past 50 (or some odd) years. (if not one of the best in all of history) Sidney Lumet finds a way to make every shot interesting and deep and is an actor's director. He is able to make an actor react and display genuine feeling in every shot and is willing to hand over the reigns to an acting great like Newman. Lumet has the ability to give great atmosphere in his shots and does a fantastic job of creating the image of Frank Galvin before and after. Lumet also makes a shot that should be a simple two shot into a masterpiece. So Yeah I'd give it a 5 star.",

That said, had I watched the movie in 1982, I suspect it would have been far greater. In 2011, we all know how the system is broken, and there have been countless movies putting their spin on that. \r\n\r\nIt's pretty gimmicky. A judge that stands up and confronts a witness? Dramatic but highly unlikely. Two great attorneys who move to and fro around the courtroom (which is full by the way for some inexlicable reason), and get in the face of witnesses. Again, very dramatic, but as far as I can tell, not allowed. At least the final witness is disallowed as I fully expected, but how does an attorney like Newman even think it will fly? \r\n\r\nNot knowing all of these movies, maybe this was groundbreaking. Maybe it was the first of its kind. Especially with Grisham churning out several of these, these stories have become mainstream. In that context, The Verdict is pretty ordinary.",
