Stephanie is tired of her relationship with top T-Bird Johnny Nogerelli (Adrian Zmed), so she breaks up with him and quickly catches the eye of English exchange student Michael Carrington (Maxwell Caulfield). Hoping to win her over, Michael tries to overcome his nerdy ways while holding off the jealous Johnny.",

It's not as grotesque and horrendous as people make out (you'd think the film committed some sort of heinous crime). \n\nI enjoyed everything! From the cringey cool guy motorcycle scenes and the awful romance songs. If you're looking for an easy and fun watch this is a great choice! I've watched it three times in two days and can't stop singing \"Cool Rider\"",

Because Grease 2 actually has its merits. The songs are really fun, even if they don't have the same staying power as \"Grease is the Word\" and \"Summer Nights\" and the choreography is pretty darn good, especially during the musical number set in a bowling alley. The performances aren't that bad either, there are some decent scenes and I laughed a few times when the movie delivered humour. But the problem is that it's nature as a Grease sequel keeps holding it down. There's the expected role reprisals from a few supporting characters, of course. Then there's the ill-advised decision to have the protagonist be a distant cousin of Sandy from the last movie which is only established in one line of dialogue making one wonder why they didn't have him be just a foreign exchange student in the first place. And no sequel would be complete without rehashing the plot of the first film, just with genders switching places. It adds some variety to the proceedings but not enough to set it apart from its beloved predecessor. Also, the gangs are a bit wimpier, at least by comparison to their predecessors. The songs can get rather out of hand at times as well. One thing I hated about them was how the songs interrupted themselves to make room for dialogue while the BGM is still playing. It tended to take me out of the movie. After seeing and reviewing this movie, I have now come to the conclusion that Grease 2 is a crappy sequel but a passable stand-alone musical that isn't entirely undeserving of scorn but didn't really strike me for a candidate of \"Top 5 worst musicals of all time\" either.",

It's certainly a step down, but the best part of the first movie was never the acting talent or the actual plot but rather the energy put into the song and dance numbers and this movie just about matches the original in that category. They used the same choreographer (who also served as director for this one) and, while the songs were certainly not as catchy, the cast really committed themselves and the dancing was great. The main problem is that the plot itself is incredibly banal, with stakes perhaps lower than I've ever seen in a movie before. The girl was supremely shallow and didn't deserve the leading man, leaving no hope that their relationship would last and no room for any emotional investment by the audience. Even the songs were about practically nothing whatsoever most of the time. This movie tests my willingness to base my rating mostly on the viewing experience when the technical merits are lacking as I liked the choreography enough to gloss over the issues with the plot and enjoy watching the movie, but in this case the problems are too severe to ignore.

Honestly, the things that are bad about the movie so overwhelm what's likeable that it's hard to know where to start. The opening is not exactly terrible, though it's also miles below its predecessor. Watching it, you can mentally check off everything that falls below \"Grease.\" Male lead? Check. Adrian Zmed is no John Travolta. Female lead? Check. Michelle Pfeiffer would become a huge star, but she wasn't there in this movie. Music? Check. the opening number of \"Back to School\" has its moments (especially in the choreography, largely because both movies had the same choreographer - Patricia Birch, who also directed \"Grease 2.\") The Pink Ladies? Check. Even without a middle-aged leader (Stockard Channing, who was grossly miscast), these Pink Ladies have very little appeal. The T-Birds? Check. The T-Birds of Grease were definitely the coolest guys in school. These birds are slightly more cool than Eugene. And they bowl. They all bowl. Not that there's anything wrong with bowling, but when bowling is the coolest thing to do when you're in high school, there's definitely something wrong. And that's where I always tend to stop watching this movie. When the film moves to \"We're Gonna Score Tonight\" (the big bowling musical number), my stomach begins to turn and I have to turn the TV off, or at least to another channel. This number was intended to be naughty with its not-so-subtle double entendres, but it really just comes across as stupid. Yes, I have ultimately watched the entire movie, and it's all just a cheap substitute for the original \"Grease.\" If they'd taken some more time to write some decent songs, and if they'd written an actual screenplay with interesting characters, making a \"Grease\" sequel would have been worthwhile. Instead, we have \"Grease 2,\" which isn't even worthwhile for viewing in a single sitting.",

(My VHS tape of this movie eventually died because I watched it all the time.) To me it is dreamy. I love the characters, soundtrack, dancing, and theme of the movie.  In fact, I always wanted my name to be Stephanie, or at least name my children Stephanie or Michael when I had them because of this movie.  Luckily, I was able to give my son the middle name Michael :) \n\nYes, it is not \"Grease\"  but I am more than OK with that because it is two years later and it would be weird for Danny and Sandy to be hanging out at their old high school post graduation unless they were teachers. Again, quit comparing it to \"Grease.\"  I also liked that some of the minor characters from Grease were in this movie, like Principal McGee, Blanche, Coach Calhoun, Eugene, and of course Frenchy to tie it back to Grease, but it is separate movie and not a continuation of Grease.  \n\nAlso, this movie focuses more on the Pink Ladys and girl power than the T-Birds!!  For example, Stephanie questions being in a relationship with Johnny, and she wants something more in life than just making out.  As a young girl watching this movie, it was empowering because most movies at the time taught girls that their happiness relied on a man.  \n\nSo, see this movie!!

Though the story is generally the same as the first one, it is not told the same however, rather than two people changing to try to win the love of the other, \"Grease 2\" only really sees one person trying to change to win the other. This movie is long, some of the dance numbers are vastly drawn out for what seems like no reason. The music is not terrible and performed well, with the given material. The same can be said about the acting. The actors do a decent job with the given material. Director Patrica Birch (who also worked on the first one) does a passable job as director, in fact, the direction is not bad at all with the story she was working with.

Now, as an adult, I would not say I still love it, but it is enjoyable to watch. Its worth watching at least once, if you are into musicals. If you found the first one to just be \"okay\", do not watch it, you will hate it.",

            "content": "Grease 2 is a romantic comedy musical that is severely overlooked. A sequel to the adaptation of the Broadway show Grease, it stars Maxwell Caulfield and Michelle Pfeiffer, two powerhouse singers who have electric chemistry on-screen. Grease 2 has a deep emotional range, with upbeat songs about lust (\"Prowlin'\") and slow ballads about the hardships of being yourself (\"Charades\"). The movie is not without laughs, the song \"Reproduction\" always draws at least a chuckle from the most stoic of viewers.\nThe writing is also very comedic, with witty banter flying between the characters. One of my personal favorite scenes is toward the beginning, when the Pink Ladies (Stephanie, Rhonda, Paulette, and Sharon) are standing at their lockers, and the T-Birds (Johnnie, Goose, Louis, and Davey) have just left with the parting words \"You may turn up on the Bandstand, but your beak will still be turning DOWN,\" in reference to Rhonda's nose. The following hilarious exchange occurs:\n\nRhonda: That's it. The nose goes. Bandstand, here I come.\nPaulette: Rhonda, I wouldn't fool around with mother nature if I were you.\nSharon: You fooled around with everyone else, Paulette.\nPaulette: Oh shut up.\n\nThere are also a lot of social issues addressed in Grease 2, such as pressuring a partner into sex, possessiveness over how a partner dresses and acts, and changing yourself to fit social expectations. There is a happy ending, with all couples agreeing to meet in the middle, and during the song \"We'll Be Together\" they each have a conversation about the above issues, and they are all resolved.\nMany people dismiss Grease 2 as a bad sequel to a classic movie, but I bet most of them haven't given it a chance. It's a goofy movie, sure, and the plot isn't genius, but it's entertaining and the music is very catchy. If you liked Grease, then you are sure to like Grease 2.",

            "content": "Completely unimpressed by the lack of originality and overrated reviews of the awful musical film Grease, I figured Grease 2 couldn't be any worse, and it did feature a young role for 3 time Academy Award nominee Michelle Pfeiffer so for some reason I just went ahead and watched it.\n\nFrom the mere intro of Grease 2, it is instantly apparent that the film is going to be bad. It breaks out into a senseless dance sequence with a song that isn't catchy and a bunch of teenagers prancing around. But then again, this is the exact same crap that Grease presented to viewers in 1978.\nGrease 2 is a bad idea from the start because a sequel to a musical film is never a good idea. That is why the relatively unknown sequel to The Rocky Horror Picture Show entitled Shock Treatment was so unsuccessful, and so a sequel to Grease is not a better idea. I hated Grease anyway, so I pretty much just went in with hopes that I could tolerate this one more than the its predecessor which had its hype drilled into my head by all the Australian morning news shows boasting about how we should be proud of Olivia Newton-John's success when it was from a 36 year old film which is dated and crappy. But it was my opinion that with Michelle Pfeiffer cast in the lead role it couldn't be worse than Grease.\nThe story in Grease 2 is slightly better than its predecessor because the love story is slightly less repetitive, generic and overused, although it still is of rather poor calibre. Grease 2 is a thinly written film with a dull script and another cheap plot which it milks for all it can yet pretty much comes up dry the whole time. And all the colourful costumes and scenery as well as the fine cinematography is not enough to mask the fact that underneath, Grease 2 is too formulaic and dim-witted to satisfy anyone but the most die hard fans of Grease, but the paper thin writing and weakly sketched characters as well as a distinct lack of originality was not enough for me.\nI didn't like the songs in Grease because I found that they were generic and repetitive, so of course I found that to be the case in Grease 2, only that they were even worse this time around because the songs were retreading old material without a hint of originality or creativity in them. I didn't like any of the music in Grease 2 except the song \"Cool Rider\" which was rather catchy and sung very well by Michelle Pfeiffer despite not being so well written. The music in Grease 2 is unforgettable and generic, but at least it wasn't as irritating as the music in the first Grease.\nIn the end, the only really appealing aspect of Grease 2 is its cast, and while it doesn't save the film from collapsing under its own mediocrity it at least makes the screen a bit brighter when its stuck under stiff and dark direction from Patricia Birch who in her one effort as a film director turns weak material into misguided cinema.\nMichelle Pfeiffer's character is a superior character to Olivia Newton-John's in Grease because her character is an independent woman who doesn't rely on a boyfriend for social standards or happiness, while Olivia Newton-John's character was one that suggested to women everywhere that you should sacrifice who you are and everything you believe in for some man you think you love during your teenage years. Michelle Pfeiffer's performance is better than Olivia Newton-John's for a lot of reasons, with a lot of them being that her singing voice is excellent and sung way better than the screechy high pitched lyrics that Olivia Newton-John stuck into the ears of viewers in the first Grease. Michelle Pfeiffer's youthful charisma and dedication to the part manages to lighten up the screen in Grease 2, and it proves early on the talented actress she would later go on to become.\nMaxwell Caulfield's rising career was ruined by Grease 2 which was a shame because he is a strong cast member. He doesn't have the same charm that John Travolta had, but his character isn't as stuck up or arrogant as John Travolta's was so it was easier for me to tolerate him. I found that I was able to sympathise for him and that his intentions as a man of romance were less generic and more meaningful, if a little melodramatic at times. Also, his singing voice has a certain quaint sophistication to him. So Maxwell Caulfield is a good choice for the lead in Grease 2.\nChristopher McDonald is an underrated actor in my opinion, so it's good to see him taking on a role in Grease 2 in his youth because his natural acting charisma and his ability to act stuck up well manages to benefit his characterisation of Goose McKenzie well. He is a notable addition to the cast.\nAnd it's good to see Maureen Teefy taking on another role after her great performance in the musical classic Fame. It gives her a chance to show off her charismatic skills as a young actress as well as her beautiful singing voice once again even though she is working with weak material and low quality song writing. She is a charming face in Grease 2 and makes the experience more entertaining.\n\nBut while Grease 2 boasts the strength of a dedicated cast and a charming performance from a young Michelle Pfeiffer before her international breakthrough as an actress, Grease 2 has the same essential problems of its crappy predecessor without the kinetic energy that made it iconic. And as a person who avidly hated the first Grease, I can say that at best, Grease 2 is only slightly better than Grease because the music wasn't ear piercing, the story wasn't as painfully generic and the leads are a lot more likeable this time around.",

            "content": "In 1961, two years after \"Sandy\", \"Danny\" and the gang from Rydell High School graduated and went on with their lives, we return to the school on the first day of the school year with a new group of students, along with some familiar faces.\r\n\r\n\"Michael\" (Maxwell Caulfield), the British cousin of \"Sandy\", arrives on the first day as students are dancing and singing. He is met by \"Frenchy\" (Didi Conn), the \"Beauty School Dropout\" who is returning to start her career in cosmetology by learning high school chemistry.\r\n\r\nSoon after arriving, he bumps into the beautiful \"Stephanie\" (Michelle Pfeiffer, in her first starring role), who is the leader of the girls gang the \"Pink Ladies,\" and the latest girl of \"Johnny\" (Adrian Zmed), the leader of the \"T-Birds\", a gang once lead by \"Danny\" in the original movie.\r\n\r\nIt is love at first sight for the well-mannered young man, but he quickly learns that he has to be a \"T-Bird\" to date her. But, he will do anything to get close to her.\r\n\r\nNow, \"Michael\" pursues his crush by turning into what \"Stephanie\" wants -- a \"cool rider\" who will sweep her off her feet.\r\n\r\nLet me say right off the bat, this is a very weak followup to one of the greatest musicals of all time. It just completely lacks the magic of the original film.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, there is the music. If you ask me, only two of the 13 songs are memorable. The rest, though having the sound of early-60's music, is just terrible and uninspired. To me, most of the tunes sounded as if they were just thrown together just before production starts. As for the choreography in these scenes, it's hit or miss. In the original, we get an energetic dance number in the school gym, which is one of the most memorable moments in the movie. In Grease 2, we get an out-of-nowhere number in the local bowling alley that the cast appeared to enjoy doing. However, I would not want to go back to learn these steps (and I am in a wheelchair). I also felt, with some exceptions, that the cast was taught the choreography the day before filming the dance scenes.\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest problems is character development. To me, the characters seemed to have been written as if we are expected to know the new faces. Most of the main characters appear to be loosely based on specific characters from the first film (most notably \"Michael,\" a male version of \"Sandy\" with a bit of \"Danny\" thrown in, and \"Stephanie\", a female version of \"Danny\" with a bit of \"Sandy\" thrown in). There are also many supporting characters with their own, minor story lines which barely moves the story along. We get only minor basics of these characters, and the audience mostly ignores them due to not being presented well.\r\n\r\nAs for performances from the main cast, they are fairly good, but not perfect. Pfeiffer is near perfect in her first major role on the silver screen, and carries the weaker members of the cast fairly well in their scenes together -- and she can actually carry a tune pretty well (especially in \"Cool Rider,\" one of the only two songs you will most likely remember after the closing credits end. Caulfield was pretty good as \"Michael\", even in his invented alter-ego to swoon \"Stephanie\". However, there was something lacking in their romantic chemistry most of the time.\r\n\r\nThe supporting cast, all around, is quite weak. Like I said, these characters are horribly written. We only get the most basic information. The \"T-Birds\" lacked the feel of being a unit, as did the \"Pink Ladies.\" We even get some of the original cast in this film, but they are only on-screen to deliver a line or two as the movie progresses.\r\n\r\nAs for the wardrobes, nothing real special here. The gym shirts the men wear in one scene appear to have the school name ironed onto it, and not in a quality a school district would spend the money on. I found the wardrobe pretty boring actually. The \"Pink Ladies\" and \"T-Birds\" iconic jackets don't look that great on the cast members wearing them. And, especially with certain male members of the cast, the hairdos look too much teased. It looked as if they cut some corners on the wardrobes and hairdos to me.\r\n\r\nThe story just feels rushed, especially the part where \"Michael\" creates his alter-ego. It appears that he became an expert in riding rather quickly, as there was no way to tell how much time had past.\r\n\r\nI really can't recommend this one. If you already own the first movie, I would suggest that you get this film just so you can have both movies. And that's the only reason to purchase it. It's just not able to live up to the icon that is the original.",
