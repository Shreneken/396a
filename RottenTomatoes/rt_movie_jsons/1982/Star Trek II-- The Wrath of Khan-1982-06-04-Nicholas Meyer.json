    "summary": "As Adm. James T. Kirk (William Shatner) and Capt. Spock (Leonard Nimoy) monitor trainees at Starfleet Academy, another vessel from the United Federation of Planets is about to try out the planet-creating Genesis Device in a seemingly deserted portion of space. In the process, two of Kirk's officers are captured by Khan (Ricardo Montalban), an enemy Kirk thought he'd never see again. Once more, Kirk takes the Enterprise's helm, where he meets Khan's ship in an intergalactic showdown.",

I did not see it as anything special. It was okay, but not a cinematic masterpiece by any of my personal standards.",

It unquestionably has the best space battle ever done, relying on tactics and a real building sense of drama  rather than the CGI and an infinite supply of enemy drones to be destroyed.  When a character, even a relatively minor character dies, we feel it. Ricardo Montalban takes what had been a relatively-obscure villain and turns him into a character of Shakespearean proportions.  Yes he is over-acting, but he pulls it off, and the director actually manages to rein in Shatner's overacting into the best performance in the series.  Also one of the best death scenes ever put to film.  Yes, they ruin it by brining the character back in the next episode, but when the film came out there was not a dry eye on the house.  Also Kobayashi Maru, which was so classic that just that opening scene became iconic for all of film culture.",

As Roger Ebert put it on Siskel and Ebert back in 82, \"All Star Trek needed was a good Darth Vader.\"  And boy does Montalban deliver!  With his sexy, barrel-chested warlord barbarian; seething with viciousness and superiority; and more importantly; with an established history with Kirk and the Enterprise crew which he tried to mutiny decades before; Khan may be one of filmdom's best villains. He does in fact give Vader a run for the money!  It's too bad they had to kill him off- he would have made a great recurring villain.  The Enterprise crew is much more fleshed out this time around; allowing the humanity, humor and chemistry that made the original show so special. Only complaint: it was a mistake to have Kirk and Khan's entire conflict play out as they scream at eachother through teleprompters.  They should have met at some point and battled hand to hand; the story would have been much stronger. Supposedly there was originally going to be a scene like that but it was cut out-and that was a big mistake.  Still, the movie's still awesome; still highly recommended!",

Soon after, it slows down a little, but it still isn't as monotonous as number one. Both the speed and the writing, in my opinion, are better. More intriguing is the conversation. This one has a more complex plot and a clearly defined antagonist. This one has a little more suspense and thrill than the previous, which I found missing. Additionally, the characters in this one have a lot more to accomplish. However, I do believe that the last 30 minutes or so kind of drag. Although I think this one is better than the original, there is undoubtedly potential for development. It is still not all that good.",

            "content": "For this uninitiated casual fan, it's an ambivalent experience watching this in 2022 for the first time on a massive screen. How did a film with such dated/dodgy special effects (which wasn't that wonderful even back in 1982) and a fair amount of overacting from its central cast, manage to attract such adoration from people who would scoff otherwise, while making grown men (and women) weep? After its lacklustre first attempt to move from the small to the big screen, this sequel boldly takes inspiration from s1e22 of the TV show as its starting point. After being exiled to an uninhabitable planet with his motley crew of New Romantics rejects many years ago, a chance happening allows Ricardo Montalban's Khan to escape and exact revenge on Captain Kirk and the SS Enterprise. With Nicholas Meyer's proficient directing, acting levels that vary from pseudo-Shakespearean to shouting to William Shatner, and a screenplay introducing Bibi Besch and Marritt Butrick's mother-and-son scientists-in-peril, this space soap opera is ready to go where many (writers) have been before. The film is, to borrow Spock's famous assessment, illogical, yet no matter how naff or silly it is, its warm fuzzy nostalgic charm simply cannot be denied, and perhaps here lies the key to the appreciation of this film. Behind the scene politics might have accidentally bestowed a poignant ending here that commercial considerations later will unravel, but it's one of its few true emotional moments that explains why this franchise still maintains such a fiercely loyal following four decades later. I may find this dated and I've still got more questions than answers about its dubious plotting but, fans or not, one can't really begrudge a film that gifted us that wonderfully camp yet ridiculously endearing Khhhhhaannnn!! meme, which perfectly sums up the film for me.",

Yes, there is the emotional stuff - the theme of ageing, the emotional heft of seeing the old team back together, Kirk's son, Spock's death etc. But if you strip that away the story itself would not fill much more than one of the original half hour TV shows. It also looked strangely more old fashioned than the TV series - the uniforms in paricular were clunky with some kind of flap that needed buttoning up, the special effects - explosions! - a bit naff. Uhura was strangely under used, maybe the producers thought her too old? I don't know, it just didn't have the feshness and other worldiness of the TV series",

Every film franchise has to start somewhere, and 'The Motion Picture' paved the way to better films. Of which the second film 'The Wrath of Khan' is among the best, a strong contender for the best. Much appreciated its darker tone, emotional wallop and that it was much better paced and action-oriented than 'The Motion Picture'.\n\nIt may not be as visually stunning as 'The Motion Picture' (the production values is one of only two areas that is done better in that film to here), and William Shatner still goes overboard in his acting. Then again Shatner was never known for subtlety and when he was restrained (like 1958's 'The Brothers Karamazov') those instances were rare.\n\n'The Wrath of Khan' is hardly cheap-looking though, having better production values generally than the original series. The sets are more elaborate, the photography is moody and stylish and the special effects are hardly hokey. While Jerry Goldsmith's music is missed a little, James Horner is more than up to the plate, not as rousing but typically beautifully orchestrated and high in the thrills factor. The sound effects are suitably eerie.\n\nWriting is an improvement, getting to the point more and less talk heavy, it is very intelligent and thought-provoking without being overly serious. The story has no pacing issues, being much tighter and with much more going on. Credit is due too for exploring (beautifully) dark and universal themes. Nicholas Meyer is a more than welcome replacement, showing more of a sense of loyalty to the original series while bringing his own style without being too ambitious.\n\nActing, with the exception of Shatner, is good. Leonard Nimoy has rarely been more moving, with a truly powerful final scene, and Riccardo Montalban rarely so deliciously campy (without ever hurting the film's tone and still being entertaining) and also menacing. No pointless or underwritten characters here.\n\nOverall, great and one of the best 'Star Trek' films. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Blasphemy!! \n\nI can completely understand WHY this film is held in such high regard with the fanbase.\n\nThough The Motion Picture made good money at the box office it was not critically well received and to do another film like TMP would have probably not made nearly as much money and Star Trek would have died away with no more movies in the 80s. Maybe the franchise itself would have been dead for a long time. \n\nSo The Wrath of Khan represents a very successful change of pace after TMP. \nThe villain is strong and played brilliantly. The themes about aging and life lessons etc are well conveyed and played out. \n\nPerhaps my issues here lie in its limited budget (even by a 1982 standard). Some of the FX are great but not always IMO. It's somewhat inconsistent in that regard. \n\nThe pacing is also not the best but a bit messy occasionally and it sometimes looks more like a B movie in that regard. \n\nIt's a GOOD movie absolutely. But I don't think it's the best Trek movie or a movie way above the others like some of the fanbase place this film.. It's a film now showing its age but its definitely the first good Star Trek film. I prefer Star Trek VI and Star Trek First Contact over this and I'd say this film stands as a touchstone for the franchise. \n\nIts a very important film in the Canon and its highly recommended, warts and all!",

The trick is to take non fans of \"Star Trek\" and turn them into fans and \"Star Trek II\" does that.  At least it did for me.  This should've been the first film in the series.\nThe plot this time is simple \u2014 revenge.  Based on an episode of the TV series, the crew of Reliant is sent to find a lifeless planet to test out a project called Genesis that takes a lifeless space body and creates a lush living planet able to sustain whole populations.  When they come across an abandoned cargo ship, it turns out someone has survived exile with his crew, Khan (played with impeccable camp by Ricardo Montalban) and he is hell bent on seeking revenge on Admiral Kirk and seizing Genesis for himself.\nFilled with exciting battle sequences accompanied with an equally exciting musical score, a much more straight forward plot and more camaraderie among the Enterprise characters which were all missing from the first film.  This entry wastes very little screen time and gets going.  Even better is the actors who this time around know they can't act and play off that.  Especially evident of Willam Shatner's iconic outcry \"KHAAAAAN!!!\"  \nThis film is a lot of fun and one to binge watch on a rainy day.",

My favorite part when there was a shore leave fight between the Enterprise crew and some Klingons, and when Captain Kirk asks if the fight was over his being insulted, he is dismayed to be told no.\n\nI picked this one up because I heard it was supposed to be the best of the 1980's Star Trek movies, but found it disappointing and didn't finish it. It drags on, makes its points about Kirk being in a midlife crisis early on and goes on too long with the idea, and the villain Khan is not frightening like he should have been, I remember all the fuss by fans when the original movie came out and how that turned out to be nothing special. I had high hopes for this one because it was supposed to be the best, and learned the lesson that the other movies must have been even worse.",

            "content": "Star Trek The Wrath of Khan is definitely episodic, but has more action and more special effects than the first Star Trek film, which will delight all types of Sci-Fi fans. It was inspired choice to bring back one of the most popular characters from the original Star Trek TV series, Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n as Khan Noonien Singh, the genetically enhanced, megalomaniac super-soldier left over from Earth's Eugenics wars, and an excellent adversary for the courageous, good-willed Captain Kirk. However, Kirstie Alley, one of the most emotional actresses in the industry, is totally miscast as the emotionally controlled Vulcan, Saavik. The script cleverly acknowledges the fear many members of the principal cast were feeling about their ageing process being revealed to all on the big screen, with Shatner's character Kirk expressing his regret about celebrating yet another birthday. However, the introduction of what is revealed to be Kirk's now fully grown adult son feels forced, something that is convenient for the script, but not consistent with Star Trek canon. Kirk pays little regard to David from that point on, making it difficult to believe he is so devastated at David's loss in the next sequel. The pace of this film is much better than the first Star Trek picture, showing that the filmmakers realised their mistakes in the first film. The action sequences are exciting, and the decision to hold the final battle scenes inside a nebula was also inspired, invoking memories of another great Star Trek TOS episode, Balance of Terror. The special effects are also much better, the film being noteworthy for having the first fully CGI sequence used in a motion picture. Nimoy's death scene done well, and was quite shocking to Star Trek fans in the day. However, it would having been moving if they had been generous with the make-up effects, underscoring how much he had suffered with his sacrifice to save the ship. Instead, the moment of his death is a bit underwhelming. Shatner, on the other hand, seems genuinely distressed about the loss of his friend, perhaps more so than in the next movie when he is informed that his son David had been killed. Of course, Shatner may have just been genuinely upset at realising Nimoy had just stolen the show. Star Trek The Wrath of Khan is fun and exciting sci-fi, in keeping with Star Trek tradition. This was the right film to follow up Star Trek The Motion Picture, and deservedly one of the fan favourites.",

Fast, fun, and full of action. I\u2019d forgotten just how awesome Ricardo Montalban is as Khan, and how great Khan is as Kirk\u2019s nemesis. The film builds to the incredible crescendo of the blind battle inside the nebula where Kirk finally gets the upper hand and cripples the Reliant, causing Khan to try to wipe the Enterprise out with the Genesis device. Spock\u2019s sacrifice is brought to us brilliantly; it\u2019s not overly dramatic, but the poignancy of the act comes across perfectly. 4.5/5, only failing to achieve full bananas due to a slightly weaker musical score and the obvious re-use of a couple of scenes from the first film. Nicholas Meyer did an outstanding job on this, and quite possibly saved Star Trek as a whole. Another bad outing after the first film could easily have meant curtains for the whole thing.",

The dialogue feels more natural and is just fun to listen to. The score is different this time around, I did like Star Trek: The Motion Picture's score better but Khan's theme is definitely a very good motif used in the movie. The set design and costume design have also improved greatly over the last entry and the visual effects are also very good. Overall, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is a step up from the first entry in the franchise and definitely the best movie in the first Star Trek Saga. \n",

People rave about Ricardo Montalban, but he has a ship...he could just leave there and his henchmen tells him this. But no, he just prances around and does nothing for the remainder time. But, there is more action. There is more suspense with the bugs that crawl in your ears. The ending with Spock, it didn't fit for me. Your supposed to be sad at the end and they play Amazing Grace with a bagpipe. You begin to wonder, \"How would the Vulcans do it?\" But, there was a new crew and Jim and company have to deal with that and it was cunning with that. Plus the Enterprise is getting old as well as the crew and they deal with it their own way. That I liked. It was hammy in places with dialogue in its corny way. But the music was spot on.

            "content": "Amazingly, the deeply mediocre Star Trek: The Motion Picture not only did not kill the franchise but was financially just successful enough to prompt the creation of a second Star Trek film. That film was Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, and it is a vast improvement over its predecessor. The film was directed by Nicholas Meyer, who reportedly had never seen the television series prior to being hired to direct but compensated for this lack of familiarity by binge watching the entire series. Meyer noticed that the episode \"Space Seed\" had an interesting villain and the potential for continuation. Hence, The Wrath of Khan is a sequel to \"Space Seed\", depicting the escape of that episode's genetically engineered superman Khan from the planet to which he and his followers were exiled.\n\nNicholas Meyer was correct in concluding that Khan could be made into an interesting villain. Khan is fascinating, intelligent and threatening but flawed in his overconfidence and his obsession with revenge against Kirk. His motivations, unlike some other Star Trek villains, are also understandable \u2013 he has lost his wife and many of his friends and blames Kirk for placing him in the situation which, however inadvertently, caused this to happen. Regarding his obsession with revenge, his character takes some inspiration from Captain Ahab, down to directly quoting Moby Dick and the appearance of a copy of the novel as a background prop in one of the opening scenes, although not to the point of being a clone. He is played by the same actor as in The Original Series, Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n, who gives a fine performance.\n\nThis being Star Trek, Khan's revenge naturally involves a few space battles. The opening fight between the Enterprise and the Reliant is one of my favorite battle scenes in all of science fiction. This is not because of exceptional effects or scale. Rather, I love this scene because of the tension it builds through a combination of dramatic irony and rapid cross cutting, and because of the significance it has in establishing the characters \u2013 the Enterprise survives because of Kirk's quick-thinking and Khan's overconfidence and need to gloat at his adversary.\n\nThis scene and the rest of the scenes in the movie are accompanied by a fantastic score by Academy Award winning composer James Horner. As much as I love Ron Jones' work for Star Trek: The Next Generation, the score to The Wrath of Khan is superior work. Indeed, this is the score which plays in my head whenever I think of Star Trek. Speaking of iconic additions to the Trek universe, the Starfleet uniforms created for The Wrath of Khan were used for the rest of the Original Series movies, and for good reason \u2013 they are undoubtedly my favorite Trek uniforms and vastly superior to the pajama-like uniforms from The Motion Picture.\n\nSome fans believe The Wrath of Khan saved the franchise. Regardless of whether this is true or not, Star Trek would certainly be less without it. The Wrath of Khan is one of the high points of the franchise \u2013 while it ditches some of The Motion Picture's flashy effects, it is hard to care when the script is far better written and includes concrete themes such as revenge and dealing with aging and death. Despite having the lowest budget out of all the official Star Trek films, The Wrath of Khan is easily my favorite. It proves, as the Original Series proved years earlier, that a low budget film or television show can become a classic if it has talented and passionate people on board",

It is short on technical aspects like visual effects, sound department, production design, costume design and editing. The script has a lot of crispness in it to make it to screen and offer the audience the essential cinematic experience but what it lacks is enough concrete material to feed the audience for its almost two hours. Nicholas Meyers; the screenwriter-director, has got the appropriate vision and even though he fails to execute it as anticipated, the impact makes it worth the effort and time in here. The performance is plausible in here especially by the newer member Khan played by Ricardo Monatalbam and stayed true to their return roles by William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy and Deforest Kelly as a supporting cast. Star Trek : The Wrath Of Khan encourages the enraging behavior and allows the audience to shift on definite answers through moral complications and nail-biting dramatic sequences.",

            "content": "While I never saw Wrath of Khan I was aware of a number of key plot points because of my time in geek culture. So, how is it possible (knowing it was coming and even seeing the moment out of context before) that I was crying at the end of this film? I have to chalk it up to strong characters, and good story structure. There was enough build and excitement that I basically forgot more drama was coming. Ending the film in that way was a bold choice and I am impressed that they didn't cheapen it in the same way Into Darkness did when it emulated the same climax.\n\nMy only complaint about Wrath of Khan comes in the slow build of the first act. There seemed to be a lot of references to how long it had been since they were on the Enterprise and how old they were getting. It was a bit of nostalgic reflection that might suit fans, particularly at that time, but felt a little drawn out to me. I know the trope of the over-the-hill guys pulling together for one last hurrah, but knowing they would do this several more times in the movies kind of weakened that scene for me.\n\nOtherwise, once Moby Dick in Space gets going, I was hooked. Most of the space battles and action sequences are actually fairly brief, yet I was tense through every single one. I loved the interactions between Kirk and Khan, as they kept trying to outdo one another, and pushed one another's buttons. The sequence where the Enterprise crew hacks the shields was so well done I was clenching the arms of my chair in anticipation. \n\nI have to say, considering everyone in the world seems to think Wrath of Khan is the best Star Trek film, I kind of expected to find it disappointing and unable to live up to the hype. Yet this truly is one of the greatest Star Trek films of all time. I haven't had a franchise movie impact me on such a visceral and emotional level in a long time. This one accomplished that and then some. It's a movie I was thinking about for hours afterwards, and will probably seek to add to my collection.",

            "content": "In the year 2285, the USS Reliant is on a mission to search for a lifeless planet for testing of the Genesis Device, a technology designed to reorganize matter to create habitable worlds for colonization. Reliant officers Commander Pavel Chekov (Walter Koenig) and Captain Clark Terrell beam down to the surface of a possible candidate planet, which they believe to be Ceti Alpha VI; once there, they are captured by genetically engineered tyrant Khan Noonien Singh (Ricardo Montalban). 15 years prior, the Enterprise discovered Khan's ship adrift in space; Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner) exiled Khan and his fellow supermen to Ceti Alpha V after they attempted to take over the Enterprise. After they were marooned, Ceti Alpha VI exploded, shifting the orbit of Ceti Alpha V and destroying its ecosystem. Khan blames Kirk for the death of his wife and plans revenge. He implants Chekov and Terrell with indigenous creatures that enter the ears of their victims and render them susceptible to mind control, and uses the officers to capture the Reliant. Learning of Genesis, Khan attacks space station Regula I where the device is being developed by Kirk's former lover, Dr. Carol Marcus, and their son, David. Next up is the utter destruction of Kirk...\n\nAfter the lukewarm reaction to the first film, fan response to The Wrath of Khan was highly positive. The Wrath of Khan was released in North America on June 4, 1982. It was a box office success, earning US$97 million worldwide and setting a world record for first-day box office gross. The film's success was credited with renewing interest in the franchise. Mark Bernardin of Entertainment Weekly went further, calling The Wrath of Khan \"the film that, by most accounts, saved Star Trek as we know it\"; it is now considered one of the best films in the series. The film's pacing was praised by reviewers in The New York Times and The Washington Post as being much swifter than its predecessor and closer to that of the television series. Janet Maslin of The New York Times credited the film with a stronger story than The Motion Picture and stated the sequel was everything the first film should have been. Variety agreed that The Wrath of Khan was closer to the original spirit of Star Trek than its predecessor. Strong character interaction was cited as a strong feature of the film, as was Montalb\u00e1n's portrayal of Khan. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times and Derek Adams of Time Out complained about what were seen as tepid battle sequences, and perceived melodrama. While Ebert and TV Guide felt that Spock's death was dramatic and well-handled, The Washington Post's Gary Arnold stated Spock's death \"feels like an unnecessary twist, and the filmmakers are obviously well-prepared to fudge in case the public demands another sequel\". Negative reviews of the film also focused on the acting, and Empire singled out the \"dodgy coiffures\" and \"Santa Claus tunics\" as elements of the film that had not aged well.\n\nAfter the lackluster critical and commercial response to The Motion Picture, series creator Gene Roddenberry was forced out of the sequel's production. Executive producer Harve Bennett wrote the film's original outline, which Jack B. Sowards developed into a full script. Director Nicholas Meyer completed the final script in 12 days, without accepting a writing credit. Meyer's approach evoked the swashbuckling atmosphere of the original series, and the theme was reinforced by James Horner's musical score. Nimoy had not intended to have a role in The Motion Picture's sequel, but was enticed back on the promise that his character would be given a dramatic death scene. Negative test audience reaction to Spock's death led to significant revisions of the ending over Meyer's objections. The production used various cost-cutting techniques to keep within budget, including utilizing miniatures from past projects and re-using sets, effects footage and costumes from the previous movie. Among the film's technical achievements is it being the first feature film to contain a complete sequence created entirely with computer-generated graphics. \n\nI didn\u00b4t grow up with the Star Trek tv-show, however I had a Mr. Spock action figure from the tv-show as a kid and when \"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\" came out in 1979 that did catch my attention with more action figures. That film was a tedious and slow paced vehicle and not that intriguing as far as I remember. So I never saw \"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\" when it came out in 1982. The film is sort of a sequel to the episode \"Space Seed\" from the original series as Khan returns with a plan of vengeance against Captain Kirk and his crew. Yes, there\u00b4s somewhat a nostalgic feeling to it even if the film also carries a campiness like the tv-show did. The top moments are the battle of the mind between Kirk and Khan and Spock's sacrifice at the end. Moments that stands out. And it\u00b4s nice to see a young and beautiful Kirstie Alley as Vulcan Lieutenant Saavik. \"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\" is ok in my book, but not something that sticks to me like it does to a Trekkie.",

Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is better than the first film in almost every aspect.  I took issue with the pacing, overuse of special effects, length, and the lack of a present villain in Star Trek: The Motion Picture.  This film wipes away silly and unnecessary special effects and gives us an intriguing story with characters who we understand and care about.  It's also a solid 30 minutes shorter without cutting out anything that would hurt the story.  I was thoroughly impressed by this sequel even 30 years after its release.\n\nWe open the film as the enterprise seemingly has a new captain in Kirstie Alley's Saavik, only to find out its a training exercise put together by Spock and Admiral Kirk.  I was worried they may rehash the same story line as the first film as Kirk seemed to hint that he may be done with the Enterprise, only to run into an old foe in Khan.  Even though I have seen bits and pieces of the original series and had been somewhat familiar with Khan as a villain, I didn't know to the extent to which him and Kirk were linked.  I was glad to see viewing of his appearance in the TV series wasn't entirely necessary as they explained enough in the 103 minute run-time.\n\nKhan has become somewhat of a pop culture icon over the years, so I had my fair share of expectations going in.  Ricardo Montalban's performance and the writing didn't let me down.  So much so that you understand where Khan is coming from when he wants Project Genesis from the crew and wants revenge for what Kirk did.  In many ways, he was Kirk's arch nemesis and proved to come through with a lot of what he swore to do to Kirk.  My only gripe with him as a villain was that I feel like we were missing an in person interaction with Kirk himself.  Speaking through a video screen inside the Enterprise isn't enough, you need that human interaction.\n\nWith that said, The Wrath of Khan has the emotional layers and character depths that the first film was lacking.  All of the original dynamics of the ship are there, plus some new and enjoyable ones as well.  Plus, it doesn't take 45 minutes for things to get going, the pacing is much improved.  James Horner's haunting score also sets the tone immediately from the opening scene, all the way through the bittersweet ending.  Overall, everything feels bigger and better with The Wrath of Khan.  Having seen the new Trek films, I think this can rank up there with them as some of the best outings the Enterprise crew has ever had.\n\n+Fantastic score\n\n+Emotionally layered\n\n+Special effects & pacing much improved\n\n+Very good villain\n\n-Although Khan was missing the human interaction with Kirk\n\n8.6/10",

With this devastating news, I watched the only Star Trek film I own and watch it as a reminder of how a great actor he was. \nThe story follows the Enterprise crew on the quest of stopping their enemy Khan Noonien Singh from obtaining a powerful terraforming device called\" Genesis\".\nIf you had read my reviews of both J.J.Abrams films, you know that I have only seen a handful of episodes of the original Star Trek series and this film so I won't pretend I am a Trekkie but I can still remember every aspect of said episodes and the same goes to \"Wrath of Khan\". \"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\" is film that has more than a handful of greatly executed elements: Solid acting with the most memorable being Ricardo Montalban as the iconic and fun villain Khan, functional special effects, the beloved and iconic Enterprise crew counts with character development that is handle perfectly, spot on pacing, serviceable action sequences, the sophisticated themes that the franchise is known for are in here, a memorable score by James Horner, memorable sequences, an over the top vibe that fits perfectly with the movie\u00b4s ideas, and it has an exciting story to tell, sure it may seem sally for the new millennium's standards but is without a doubt a memorable story. As I said in the introduction of this review, the reason I rewatch this after some many years was due to Leonard Nimoy and I got to say that this film may present Nimoy at its peak as the beloved Vulcan, I mean just look at how iconic and emotional the finale is thanks to his incredible performance, \"He's really not dead... as long as we remember him.\". \n\"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\" is the only Star Trek film I\u00b4ve seen and I glad to say that it is one of the most memorable science fiction films I have ever seen thanks to its characters and plot that continue to work even by today's demanding standards.",

The moments of humour and victory for the characters is nicely broken by Ricardo Montalban's presence, and Saavik as a new Spock protege is Masterfully executed throughout as she learns as Kirk learns that command is all about the hard choices, the no win scenarios, and the consequences of your actions. Even though some of the effects are dated it gives the film an edgy realism. My all time favourite film EVER!",

It is a good move allowing each of the classic characters to influence the story in a meaningful manner. The visuals are most impressive; they still look great. While it is more interesting than the fist movie, the main problem with the Star Trek franchise persists. Dialogue drives the tension and action, but never builds into a fully rewarding excitement. The action sequences just do not hold the impact they should. Kahn is a quality villain with a good story, but Kirk seems to manipulate him a little too easily. Character development and story are most important, but a little more action would help a great deal. This is an emotionally polarizing story that finishes in an awkward manner. Parts of it are uplifting, as expected, but there are uncharacteristically sobering events that I did not care for. It finishes off on a gloomy note that leaves an empty and unsatisfying feeling.",

Wrath of Khan, A well-directed, thrilling and surprisingly artful sequel, boldly moves this frontier into the future, all while staying true to the ethos of the classic series. Most importantly, it reminds us that it isn't our agendas, but our relationships that make life worth exploring.\nIn 1982, audiences weren't expecting much from this franchise, after the TV series was unceremoniously canceled years earlier and the first film was such an uncharacteristic slog. Maybe the cool sets, practical effects, corny posturing and brilliant score were of no surprise. Maybe even the great correlation and juxtaposition between our hero and villain may have been inevitable, with Khan and Kirk basically being two sides of the same bloated-chest coin. However, to get a Star Trek film that's such a dark and powerful metaphor for the hardships of war must've been a watershed moment, especially within the Spock-Kirk arc.\nWhat especailly surprises me is this film's status as a bonafide classic of the genre. Like other so-called \"Trekkers\", I love it, but how much of that is helped by my pre-existing fandom? Wrath... makes the decision not to waste time with character introductions or clunky backstory exposition; it assumes our knowledge of these things. Instead, it allows its strong script to stand on its own. The humor-injected dialogue, the consistent character moments, the straightforward plotting, and the wide-reaching themes connect us to these characters, whether for the first or hundredth time.",

With the exception of a particularly awful dummy ear, the special effects are generally good with some great scenes involving the iconic Enterprise and other spaceships. The screenplay of this movie went for a less cerebral and hard hitting story than the first film and this seems to fit the cast more comfortably but it manages to have one of the most moving denouement of all the Star Trek franchise. It also of course kicked off a closely linked trio of movies which kept the audience coming back for more during the early 1980s and secured the franchise for the next couple of decades after the initially poorly received opening film.

As soon as the film starts it completely gets rid if any notion that this will be as slack as the precious installment and it got to the point a lot quicker, which probably explains why I thought this movie was very short. I'm sure Paramount probably had a heart attack when they found out that the first major blockbuster for a legendary series like Star Trek did so averagely in terms of reviews. So, understandably, the budget for this one was much lower than the previous one and considering what they did with it, like making what people consider to be the best Star Trek film, is pretty impressive. I still find it funny that the first movie is considered all but irrelevant by most fans, can you imagine if THIS was the first one? There's a scene pretty early on that showcases some really good character development and it's about getting older but, at least in my opinion, the movie forgets about it even before you can, yes, the general theme of this lingers throughout the movie and is the general theme, as are a few other things, I would have liked some more moments like this but perhaps I am expecting too much? Even so, the story that's on offer here is very strong and compelling, it's an utter thrill ride to watch, the ending especially. Given the fact that the budget is significantly less than the previous movie, the visual effects really aren't as good as they were and it really took me by surprise how different everything looked, I'm not a graphics nut but it certainly something to comment on. However, if they can make a compelling story with thrilling action sequences anyway then who am I to judge? Well done for doing what you were able to with the budget that you had. If the series wanted to stop here, it would work, considering what happened at the end, which I'm sure everyone knows by now but I dare not spoil just in the sheer chance that someone who doesn't know actually reads this, this could just end here but considering what the titles of the next two movies are, this seems like the only one where it's directly connected to another one and thus actually feels necessary to have sequels. With an excellent plot, a major feeling of tension and fantastic character work by the actors involved, it isn't hard to see why a majority of fans consider this the best, I look forward to seeing it again.",

Audiences relate when the hero has challenges to overcome, not the antagonist. It'd be nice if Khan's super human buddies had some personality, but instead they just come off as minions. Death occurs too frequently and Kirk's character arch switches topic halfway through without finishing the first part. Certain lines are too corny (revenge is a dish best served cold, and it's coldest in space) and it really doesnt have the intellectual aspect of the TV show. But the movie definitely has it's positives. The slow pacing is effective, the music is great, the acting is fantastic with the only possible exception being Khan (and I would rather argue for him than against his skills), and they could not have made a better farewell for Spock. I teared up a little bit.",

Well, I say arguably. A far as I'm concerned (it is my blog after all) The Wrath of Khan is still the best Star Trek film ever made. An absolute classic! A perfect blend of humor, drama, great performances and action. All layered perfectly into a thoughtful intelligent plot, which is impeccably well-directed by Nicholas Meyer.\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nThis film is pretty much the big budget sequel to 'Space Seed', an episode from the original television show. So watching that show before you see Khan is recommended, but not critical as The Wrath of Khan fills in enough of the back story as to not be too confusing. It's worth a watch even if you're not really into Star Trek, as its themes of revenge, destiny and aging are universal so who cares if all that is played out in space, with the occasional really cool space battle?\n\nBest Format:\n\nThe special effects still hold up well. Especially the final dog fight in the cloud nebula. If your local theater was revisiting this film, certainly try to get a ticket for that. At home a HD showing is recommended. James Horner's superb score requires a decent sound system to be properly appreciated.\n\nBest elements for me:\n\nSo many to choose from. Ricardo Montalban's super slick performance. The battle in the nebula is always entertaining to watch, and the scene between Spock and Kirk at the end of the film always brings a tear to my eye (what! I'm not ashamed to admit it!) It's just all so good!\n\n-> http://www.TalkieGazette.com\n\n-> http://www.Facebook.com/talkiegazette\n\nUp for a challenge?

That being said, this is probably the best of the Star Trek movies I have seen, especially the two recent ones by J.J. Abrams. Where those were more about entertainment and action, this one (and presumably the others as well) are about ideas. In WRATH OF KHAN, this is specifically about Kirk grappling with his age and coming to terms with death. The way in which this is portrayed onscreen is both inspired and poignant, resulting in one of the most touching scenes I've seen in a sci-fi movie. Pretty much everything about this movie is excellent, from the performances, the production design, the special effects (by 80's standards) to the score. In particular, Ricardo Montalban was very menacing and memorable as the villain, Khan. Every word that came out of his mouth oozed evil. William Shatner also did an admirable job, although he occasionally slipped back into some of the mannerisms he used on the original series, which have been made fun of and parodied many times. Overall, I really liked this movie and would recommend to anyone who enjoys a great sci-fi movie with plenty of action, tension, heart and brains.",

I am frightened because I think this Star Trek film is great but the villain is memorable because of this. The only action sequences are ship and gun fire. While in some ways the action scenes were enjoyable i was expecting more.\nThe film revolves around Admiral Kirk(who I thought was a captain but I guess that's in the new movies only) who escapes the tedium desk job to join Mr.Spock. In the midst is an old enemy from there past Khan.\nIn the opening sequence you get this look at how new cadets train to lead the enterprise and in the simulation and after you meet our characters Mr.Spock,Uhura,Scotty,and afterwards James T. Kirk.\nI only saw this because I am getting ready for the release of the latest Star Trek film, and in the new one is this villain(Khan) who is widely known by the fans of this series. Personally I do nit like Khan in this movie. I like the actor who plays him cause his performance of the character is amazing but Khan I feel doesn't do much in the movie except puts worms in peoples ears and commands them, and gives orders to destroy the enterprise and James T. Kirk.\nThe Special effects are really great in this film for it's time but like the effects and the rest of the film i feel it's really dated and doesn't hold up. But it is still one of the best Star Trek movies.",

Wrath of Khan has none of the faults of the first movie and instead not only does it improves, but also evolves over the things we love about Star Trek. Strong story, great performances, great characters, great special effects, epic music and much more things to love are at hand in this sequel.\r\n\r\nWrath of Khan is one of the predecessors of today's ambitious blockbusters: intelligent, exciting, and exhilarating, with smart villains, with its proper action and fast-paced story-telling, with its strong character development moments. Is it the best Star Trek? It's debatable, but reaching a conclusion would be...illogical (jaja Spock reference, laugh), maybe Star Trek is a movie series were there's no best Star Trek movie, but just a bunch of incredible, enjoyable movies (like this one, the fourth one, the sixth, the eight and the two J.J. Abrams' Star Trek movies) and i guess that's what Star Trek is about: loveable adventures.\r\n\r\nWrath of Khan is one of the best sequels ever; it's so entertaining, likeable, amazing and simply superb. Just have in mind that the movie is so awesome, that some Trekkies actually died of emotional jeopardy and revived later by the same cause. Better fate than Spock's, eh? (jaja I'm so unfunny). Give it a try, it truly worth your time and money.",

            "content": "\"Ah, Kirk, my old friend. Do you know the Klingon proverb that tells us revenge is a dish that is best served cold? It is very cold in space.\"\n\nAfter The Motion Picture was a critical disappointment, many were wondering if there will be a Trek film that stays true to the spirit of the TV show. Enter Nicholas Meyer, a little-known director at the time who had never watched a Trek episode in his life. Taking information out of a Trek episode titled \"Space Seed\", which was about a famous villain named Khan, Meyer decided to make a Trek sequel involving Khan and a revenge scheme. And the result paid off; not only was The Wrath of Khan a bigger critical hit than The Motion Picture, to this day, it's still regarded as one of the best Trek films and was one of the inspirations to the plot of Star Trek Into Darkness. As for me, The Wrath of Khan is an excellent Trek film that shows to me that the older Trek films are truly worth watching.\n\nAdmiral Kirk (William Shatner) escapes a normal desk job to return with Spock (Leonard Nimoy), Dr. Bones (DeForest Kelley), and Scotty (James Doohan) on another voyage on the Enterprise. But on this journey, he reunites with an old enemy; Khan (Ricardo Montalban), a war criminal that Kirk had formally exiled, who's dying for revenge. Khan leads other prisoners, assumes command of a Starfleet ship, and goes after the Genesis Project, a project intending to give life to dying planets, for his own purposes as part of his scheme to ruin Kirk once and for all.\n\nThis film also features George Takei as Sulu, Walter Koenig as Checkov, Nichelle Nichols as Uhura, Bibi Besch as Kirk's wife Carol, Merrit Butrick as Kirk's son David, and in her film debut, Kirstie Alley as Vulcan Saavick.\n\nOne of the common complaints with The Motion Picture was the lack of character development, which was something that I complained about. With The Wrath of Khan, things have changed to where there is much better characterization by making the common audience (non-Trekkies) actually care about these characters. It's not perfect, as some are still completely underdeveloped, especially Uhura and Sulu, but as a whole, character development has definitely improved. The acting has improved as well, Nichelle Nichols and George Takei, while their characters are still completely underdeveloped, had much better acting this time around than their roles in The Motion Picture. Bibi Besch and Merritt Butrick are good as Kirk's family members, especially Butrick. Kirstie Alley, who I expected to be a heavy miscast due to being most famous in TV comedies, is surprisingly enjoyable as the female Vulcan Saavick. It's cool to see a fellow Vulcan other than Spock once in a while. James Doohan has improved a lot as Scotty to where he's likable and far more entertaining to hang around with. DeForest Kelley is great again as Dr. Bones, continuing his common humor and entertainment levels. Leonard Nimoy is excellent here as Spock, with great characterization and is even extremely moving in the last third of the film. The biggest improvement acting wise for sure is William Shatner as Kirk. I liked him in The Motion Picture, but I just couldn't really care too much about him. In The Wrath of Khan, his characterization has improved the most to where I actually care about what happens to his character. Shatner, an actor who I once thought as extremely cheesy, actually gives a wonderful performance playing his most famous role. If he continues to be this great in the rest of the franchise, then I'll be more excited to root for Shatner.\n\nBut there's one thing missing about the film acting wise, and that's Khan, who's played by Ricardo Montalban. Since I did not watch the original series, I had no knowledge of the episode that introduced Khan. But the good news is that for those who've never watched the show the movie is so good and so easy to understand that watching the Trek episode with Khan isn't really necessary, maybe for die-hard Trekkies though. Montalban nails the role of Khan, with as much evil in the role as Cumberbatch perfects in Into Darkness. With experiencing this and Into Darkness, I have no doubt that Khan is likely the best villain in the Trek films.\n\nI also was impressed that the story was much darker this time around, especially for a Trek film with The Original Series cast. The film plays well the strategies of Kirk and Khan's plans to defeat each other. The visuals, which were created by Industrial Light and Magic, are a improve over The Motion Picture, with the model ships looking more realistic than ever before. And the score by James Horner is a delightful listen to. \n\nIt's not a perfect film; there's still come characters that need to have full development (I'm looking at you, Uhura, Checkov, and Sulu!), but in the end, The Wrath of Khan is an excellent sequel that proves that the older films are as strong as the newer films. The main characters are better developed, the acting is great, the villain is excellent, the tension is heated up to a darker level, the visuals are outstanding, and the ending is another moving and thought-provoking ending in the Trek franchise. With The Wrath of Khan, I'm more excited about seeing how the rest of the franchise will turn out.\n\n\" I have been, and always shall be, your friend.\"",

It's easily the best of the bunch with no near competitor but unfortunately this character driven interpretation would inform following director-writers and move subsequent films away from the realm of Roddenberry's original intent and relegate the franchise to buddy movies set in space. \n\nEnjoy this movie for its memorable lines, great music score, and ham it up acting by Shatner and Ricardo Montalban. Even non-sci fi lovers can enjoy this space adventure. \n\nI just rewatched it and was amazed how well it stood up despite its quaint take on the future. It actually adds to its charm.

            "content": "After having watched Star Trek The Motion Picture, with it's numerous slow montages, long slow sequences & dialogue, and sub-par acting, I was hesitant to slip this blu ray in.\n\nFrom the onset, this is a different style of film. A different caliber if you will. In all regards, the story from the start (with the Kobeyami Maru simulation with Christie Alley) all the way to the climax is exciting and riveting. Not like a extended episode as the last film was, but as storyline on it's own.\n\nKhan is definitely my favorite Star Trek bad guy. He is powerful, vengeful and smart. You even somehow sympathize with him. Having a good antagonist to play off of in these types of films is critical. That back and forth between him and Kirk is amazing (they never meet face to face however, which is all the more impressive).\n\nBut the largest leap forward is in acting. There is a new level of cool and suave here. In the last installment the cast was almost nervous. First time on the big screen, and it showed. Here Nemoy and Shattner are in their element. It not only helps there individual performances, but their combined chemistry on screen is a huge leap forward from the last film.\n\nNaturally the VFX were ground breaking for the time, and are still entertaining today. Sound as well is top notch, with excellent folly and on-set recording. The relatively advanced \"planet simulation\", is even decent given todays standards. Very impressive!\n\nBut was this the best Star Trek original series film? Maybe... Have not had a chance to see the rest, but from what I've heard this is the best. I'll update after watching the other 5. \n\nHaving watched the original movies after the JJ Abrams remakes, I can see clear inspiration from Wrath of Khan, obviously especially so in \"The Edge of Darkness\" film. Which of the two is better? Well honestly, I can't say, this movie was probably just as breath-taking back when it was released, so probably a tie. (although I loved the JJ Abrams version!)\n\nGreat job, live long and prosper!",

            "content": "As I've said before, I am not a big Star Trek fan. I'm even less of a fan when it came to the movies that eventually spawned out of it. That being said, there is one film that not only stands above the rest, but remains arguably one of the most thoughtful and surprising sequels ever made. It is the film even none Star Trek fans like: The Wrath of Khan. \r\n\r\nIn the 1960's Star Trek was unceremoniously cancelled by NBC due to low rating after its 3rd season. But over time, the already dedicated fanbase grew even larger, resulting in the release of a a feature film: Star Trek The Motion picture. And it unfortunately wasn't Wrath of Khan. It was slow, boring, and was a disappointment to the fans. But somehow, the writers and directors got their act together and made the movie that would epitomize Star Trek's legacy and insure its survival as a series of feature films. \r\n\r\nThe story follows Kirk (William Shatner), now in his later years, has been promoted to Admiral. But he feels his best days are behind him, and he longs for the adventures he had in his youth. Still all things are pretty good, until his old enemy Khan, played by Ricardo Montalban, returns. In the original series he was a genetically advanced but brilliant conqueror from Earth's past. Kirk left him and his crew stranded on a deserted planet with no hope of escape. But escape he did, and he's back for revenge and armed with a deadly new weapon known as the genesis device. Now Kirk has to command the Enterprise once again and assemble his crew. \r\n\r\nThis is by far one of the best and most entertaining story we've gotten from Star Trek. Gone are some of the campy moments (for the most part) and instead we get one hell of an entertaining chess match between two iconic characters. You can tell that the actors have gotten much more comfortable in their roles as they have aged. Even Shatner, the king of hammy acting, gives a restrained and excellent performance (with the exception of the infamous KHANNNNNN line). The show down between Khan and Kirk is awesome to see onscreen. Even though they never have a scene with the two of them face to face, you know immediately that they are archenemies. There is a reason Khan remains the best villain in all of Star Trek. \r\n\r\nSPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT\r\n\r\nBut by far the best aspect of the film is the famous death of Spock. Everyone, even none Trek fans, knows and respects Spock. He is the most iconic character. This film made the gutsy move to kill him off in a great heroic sacrifice. He dies sacrificing his life to save the Enterprise. This is the most iconic and one the best scenes in the series's history. The reason this works, besides the writing and acting, is because you legitimately believe in the weight and certainty of the death. It deconstructs Kirk's \"no loose situation\" personal by showing that sometimes there are no win scenarios. I know Spock does come back in sequels, but personally I don't care. This was the end of his character and it was a damn good finale. \r\n\r\nThis is a great movie. There are only a few goofy moments and convenient plot points that keep it from being perfect. The special effects are dated, but that really shouldn't matter. In a few decades, films like Avatar and Transformers will seem dated. Its the story and characters that matter.",

            "content": "As a dedicated fan of the original series, as well as the franchise in general, I must say that I was awed at The Wrath of Khan. Rarely ever have films (or any media in general) been successful when using a prior plot point. An example is the episode \"The Naked Now\", the third episode of the first season of Star Trek: The Next Generation. This episode pulled a plot out of the episode \"The Naked Time\" from the Original Series, and turned out very unoriginal and very unsatisfying.\n\nHowever, The Wrath of Khan pulls a plot point from the Original Series television episode, \"Space Seed\", in which the crew of the Enterprise first encounters Khan Noonien Singh, a dictator from Earth's past who has been in suspended animation for over two and a half centuries. He then tries to hijack the Enterprise, but is stopped by then-Captain Kirk. Kirk then exiles Khan and his people to the hospitable planet of Ceti Alpha V, where Khan has the chance to build a new life for him and his crew.\n\nThe Wrath of Khan picks up fifteen years later, when Chekov (now with the USS Reliant) and Captain Terrell beam down onto the surface of Ceti Alpha V, which they mistake for Ceti Alpha VI. Their purpose; to  check Ceti Alpha VI for signs of preanimate life before testing of the Genesis Device, a torpedo-like mechanism which can be used to terraform dead planets. They discover a cargo hold, inside of which Chekov finds the insignia of the SS Botany Bay, the ship Khan was on when the Enterprise found him. Realizing what Captain Terrell and he have stumbled upon, Chekov tells the Captain that they need to leave immediately. Once they step outside the cargo hold, they find themselves surrounded by Khan and his people.\n\nKhan then places creatures in the ears of Captain Terrell and Chekov, which Khan uses to control them. Originally intending to seek revenge on Admiral Kirk, he then learns of the Genesis Device, and it's capability to destroy planets. He then uses the two to beam his people and himself aboard the Reliant, which he then takes control of. Once in control, he heads toward Regula 1, the space station where the Genesis Device is being developed. En route, he uses Chekov to inform Regula 1 that the Reliant will be taking hold of the Genesis Device. When the head of the project, Dr. Carol Marcus, asks as to who gave the order, Chekov replies that it was Admiral Kirk.\n\nThe Enterprise is on a training mission when Dr. Marcus sends a distress call to Admiral Kirk, aboard the Enterprise. He takes command of the ship, and sets a course for Regula 1. On their way there, Khan ambushes the Enterprise. With most of the trainees killed or injured, Kirk feigns submission. Khan asks for all the information that Kirk has on the Genesis device to be handed over. He gives the Admiral some time to gather the information, during which Kirk uses a prefix code to lower the shields of the Reliant, and attacks. This damages the Reliant, and Khan quickly retreats for the time-being. Kirk then continues to Regula 1, and beams down into the laboratory with Dr. McCoy and newly-added Lieutenant Saavik. There they find the corpses of the Regula 1 team, along with Chekov and Captain Terrell. \n\nThey then realize that Dr. Marcus and her son, David (who is later revealed also to be Admiral Kirk's son), are hiding deep within the planet that Regula 1 is in orbit around, along with the Genesis device. The group then beams down to their position, where it is revealed that Chekov and Captain Terrell were being used by Khan to discover where the Genesis device was. Khan then beams the device aboard the Reliant, and commands the duo to kill Kirk. Though the eel inflicts severe pain on his brain, Captain Terrell resists and shoots himself, while Chekov collapses to the floor. The eel removes itself from Chekov's head. \n\nThough the duo fails to kill Kirk, Khan assumes that the party is stranded within the planet, overhearing coded message that Spock sends to Kirk, intending to trick Khan into believing so. The party is then beamed back aboard the Enterprise, which Kirk sends into the Mutara Nebula. Within the nebula, both the shields and targeting systems of the Enterprise and Reliant are useless, making the two ships an equal chance. In a very entertaining battle, Kirk disables the Reliant. Khan, on the verge of death, activates the Genesis device, intending to destroy the Enterprise, which is within the blast radius. \n\nThe Enterprise, sensing the activation, tries to move out of the blast radius, but cannot do so with a damaged warp drive. With Kirk preoccupied, Spock moves down to Engineering, with intent to fix the warp drive. When McCoy tries to prevent Spock from doing so (as it would result in the death of Spock), Spock incapacitates McCoy. He then performs a mind-meld on an unconscious McCoy, saying to him \"Remember.\". Spock then enters the room where he can fix the warp drive, which is flooded with radiation. He successfully fixes the warp drive, but he becomes too weak to leave.\n\nStill unaware of Spock's situation, Kirk then directs the Enterprise out of the blast radius. The Genesis device explodes, and the Enterprise is not harmed. Scotty then tells Kirk to come down to Engineering, where Kirk finds Spock. Spock is at death's door, and is sitting up next to the glass separating the room he is in from the rest of Engineering. Kirk comes up to the other side of the glass, and Spock speaks his dying words. After an emotional moment, Spock dies from radiation poisoning.\n\nAt the end of the film, the crew of the Enterprise is gathered around Spock's coffin, where Kirk gives an eulogy. Spock's coffin is then shot out of the Enterprise, and is sent down onto the newly-formed Genesis planet, which was formed when the Genesis device exploded within the Mutara Nebula. \n\nStar Trek II: The Wrath of Khan was a fantastic film. With grade-A battle scenes, an entertaining and original plot, and an ending that would make fans everywhere tear-up, The Wrath of Khan proves to be a classic. A classic that will live forever within the hearts and minds of it's fans, and one that I will most certainly show my children.",

It's so bland and boring and every set piece looks the same.\nKhan was underwhelming at best, and Ricardo delivers the cheesiest performance in the entire movie; he's not the charismatic or threatening character everyone said he was. Benedict was better by far.\nThis is the first Star Trek movie I've seen that hasn't been directed by J.J. Abrams, so I guess that's why I find it so bland. But I give this film credit where credit is due: it does give us a little bit of fun action (but of course not as exciting as the new films) and at times it has some good looking computer effects, for the 80s. There were some scenes in the movie where I could feel character development in Kirk.\nBut Khan in this movie was so stupid. His character is probably the worst and most pathetic villain I've ever seen on screen, not very menacing or even very physically active; like, why is he some old guy? Just fucking shoot him in the face or hit him with his walker or something.\nHowever, despite many of its faults, WoK has its share of iconic moments, such as Khan's \"Revenge is a dish best served cold\" quote, Spock's death scene (which Into Darkness basically rip offed) and the famous \"Khaaaaaaaan!!!\" sequence. I chuckled at that scene in Into Darkness but here in this film I legit LOL'd.\nAll in all, \"Khan\" is the first and probably the last original Trek movie I'll ever watch.",

Or the one.\" \r\n\r\nI've never been a huge Star Trek fan, but even I have to admit the second Star Trek film is a very impressive entry in the series and a well-made science fiction film. \r\n\r\nCaptain Kirk, now promoted to Admiral, is starting to feel depressed about growing old and losing his youthful pride. But it looks like he may want to be careful what he wished for, because an old enemy has returned to take revenge. The genetically advanced warrior Khan has escaped exile and plans to use the \"Genesis\" device, which can create life out of nothing, as a weapon. It's up to Kirk, Spock, and the Enterprise crew. \r\n\r\nThe film, while having some very good action, also takes it's time to develop the characters and delves into some very poignant themes. The film explores the concept of death and how people often deal with it. The focus is mostly on Kirk, who, when presented with a no win situation, always found a way out. His match with Khan however, forces him to confront the idea that sometimes there is no third option and you will have to deal with your our mortality and the deaths of the people you love. This theme is really at the heart of the film, which makes it a cut above not just Star Trek films, but also most other films in it's genre. There are some slow moments and not everything has aged well for the film over the last thirty years. But even despite these flaws it remains one of the best Star Trek films. \r\n\r\nThe last few minutes of the film are some of the best moments of anything I've seen from the series. Even Shatner who usually hams it up (although he does a little in the film), delivers a truly moving performance. Excuse me; I might just have something in my eyes....",

Kirk), Leonard Nimoy(Mr. Spock), James Doohan(Scotty),Ricardo Montalban(Khan), and Bibi Besch(Carol)\nMy Review\nThis film is said to be the best Star Trek movie ever made, and if that's the case then I'm quite frightened but still curious. I am frightened because I think this Star Trek film is great but the villain is memorable because of this. The only action sequences are ship and gun fire. While in some ways the action scenes were enjoyable i was expecting more.\nThe film revolves around Admiral Kirk(who I thought was a captain but I guess that's in the new movies only) who escapes the tedium desk job to join Mr.Spock. In the midst is an old enemy from there past Khan.\nIn the opening sequence you get this look at how new cadets train to lead the enterprise and in the simulation and after you meet our characters Mr.Spock,Uhura,Scotty,and afterwards James T. Kirk. \nI only saw this because I am getting ready for the release of the latest Star Trek film, and in the new one is this villain(Khan) who is widely known by the fans of this series. Personally I do nit like Khan in this movie. I like the actor who plays him cause his performance of the character is amazing but Khan I feel doesn't do much in the movie except puts worms in peoples ears and commands them, and gives orders to destroy the enterprise and James T. Kirk.\nThe Special effects are really great in this film for it's time but like the effects and the rest of the film i feel it's really dated and doesn't hold up. But it is still one of the best Star Trek movies.",

The cast feature much more focus and development and very great acting from the crew of the Enterprise as well as the antagonists of the film.  The writing is both great for the tv series and film and works almost perfectly constantly.  The main achievement here is the direction; the direction is spectacular and Meyer does a very good job in putting the film together.  The effects are very nice for the 80s and much more appealing than the CGI of today.  Wrath of Khan is the best Star Trek film of the original crew of the Enterprise and a solid developed film.",

            "content": "On Space Station Regula I, the Genesis Device is being developed, a device capable of making planets with hostile environments habitable. Used wrongly, it can also destroy planets. While exploring a planet on which to test the device, Chekhov (Koenig) is captured by Khan (Montalban), a genetically enhanced villain who Kirk (Shatner) had exiled on a remote planet fifteen years earlier, (as seen in the original series episode 'Space Seed'). Khan is obsessed with getting even with Kirk and, having gained control of Chekhov's mind, uses him to lure Kirk to Regula I. When the Enterprise is ambushed by Khan, a battle of wits begins between Kirk and his old nemesis.\nThough it was far from a commercial flop, the negative critical and public reaction to 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' had Paramount worried about the prospects of a sequel. The decision was taken to opt for a more action oriented approach, as opposed to the philosophical feel of the first movie. Gene Roddenberry was removed from the production team in a move which, though cruel, probably needed to be taken. Sometimes it takes a neutral eye to revitalize a franchise and the director hired, Nicholas Meyer, had never even seen an episode of the TV show before landing the job.\n\nMeyer was a fan of C.S Forester's 'Hornblower' series of seafaring novels and borrowed this theme for his script. Essentially, 'Wrath of Khan' is a chess game played between the commanders of two starships; Kirk's Enterprise and Khan's hijacked Reliant. The rivalry between the two is one of the most memorable in science fiction cinema but they never actually meet face to face. Shatner wanted the film to end with a punch-up between the two men but, thankfully, the director ignored him. Meyer's vision of Kirk played up the fact that Shatner was aging and turned the character into a wise old owl, the sort of role Spencer Tracy would have played.\nThough Montalban is a formidable presence here, this is well and truly Shatner's movie. He's often mocked, (and he's often the first to mock himself), but what he may lack in technical acting chops, Shatner makes up for in raw charisma. By the film's end, it's a wonder the bridge of the Enterprise is still intact, such is the level of scenery-chewing on display. The famous \"Khaaaaaannnnnnnn!!!!!!!!!!\" roar has gone down in movie history and is probably Shatner's most famous few seconds of screen time. Of course, the strength of 'Star Trek' lay in the friendship between Kirk, McCoy (Kelley) and Spock (Nimoy), and that relationship is well handled here, with some great barbs traded between the emotional McCoy and the logical Spock.\n\nMeyer's only previous directorial outing was the Jack the Ripper time travel movie 'Time after Time'. His filmography post 'Wrath of Khan' is sparse, a shame as he shows here he really knows how to put a film together. Most of the film takes place on the bridges of two starships but Meyer manages to inject an energy into the whole affair without having to resort to any flashy or distracting tricks. Particularly clever is the montage of lights turning on as the Enterprise leaves it's docking station. Meyer would return to the director's chair for 1991's 'The Undiscovered Country' but that movie aside his CV is pretty barren. Listening to his DVD commentaries gives you the impression of a very opinionated and uncompromising individual and this may be the reason his stock didn't rise in Hollywood. It's a shame as Hollywood could use a film-maker of Meyer's talent.\nThough Jerry Goldsmith had written a stunning score for the first film, he was replaced by the young James Horner for the sequel. Horner's score is very different, employing a more nautical theme at Meyer's request, but it's just as good as Goldsmith's.\n'Wrath of Khan' is one of those rare films that pleases hardcore fans and mainstream audiences equally. Should you wish to introduce a newcomer to 'Star Trek', this is arguably the best place to start. After seeing this gripping tale, they'll be thirsty for more.",

However, instead of \"Captain Clark Terrell\" (Paul Winfield), they are contacted by \"Khan Noonien Singh\" (Ricardo Montalban, reprising his role from an episode of \"Star Trek), who, along with his geneticly-engineered crew from the 1990's spaceship, the \"SS Botany Bay\", hijacked the starship. The \"Enterprise\" crew learn that \"Khan\" wants two things -- the \"Genesis Device\" and to kill \"Kirk,\" whom he blames for the death of his wife. \r\n\r\nThis has to be the best of the \"Trek\" feature films. It has very few problems with it. \r\n\r\nFirst of all, the story is well done. It has adventure, and is well written. There are a few points in the original that didn't make it to the scrren that explains a few things in the movie, but they are minor and not really needed. \r\n\r\nThe cast is amazing, and possibly gives their best performances since moving to the silver screen. Montalban, who never appears on the same set with other main actors in the movie, is fantastic as one of his most famous television characters who built a passion for vengeance since he first crossed paths with \"Kirk\" and his crew. \r\n\r\nAnother good performance is by Kirstie Alley, in her acting debut. Any actor who can perform without showing emotion has to be good, however she did show slight emotional outbursts in some scenes, as did fellow \"Vulcan\" actor Leonard Nimoy. Their emotional outburst were warranted in those particular scenes though. \r\n\r\nOne problem script is the character development of \"Dr. Carol and Dr. David Marcus\" (Bibi Beesch and Merritt Butrick). Another development problem is the relationship between \"Kirk\" and \"Dr. Carol Marcus\", you learn they had a prior relationship, but the relationship isn't expanded upon in the movie. \r\n\r\nThe special effects are as good as other \"Trek\" movies, and hold up well after all these years. There is one special effect that didn't hold up well, and it is pretty obvious that the actor involved in the FX is in front of a blue screen. The special effects that work best are the space scenes, and are spectacular. \r\n\r\nIf you are looking for a good science-fiction movie, then rent this movie.",

Wars battle that has raged over Nerdstrom for many moon, I've always been on the Lucas side of things rather than the Roddenberry.\nThe Wrath of Khan though is one of those films that has left such a mark on sci-fi cinema that it feels like it needs to be watched, even if you're not a fan of the franchise it comes from.  And it is perhaps with good reason, as it's a worthwhile movie that even a non-fan can enjoy.\nThe Enterprise crew were all already starting to look a little long in the tooth at this stage and as the film opens they've been reduced to training the new recruits at Star Fleet.  On the other side of the galaxy a fellow Star Fleet cruiser intercepts a distress call en route to a top secret scientific space research lab only to be hijacked by the titular Khan and his band of Duran Duran video extras, a man with revenge against a certain James T. Kirk on his mind.\nI am assuming that the likes of Shatner and Nimoy play to standard in the film, their performances are enjoyable while the likes of a young Kirstie Alley provide a youthful aspect to the cast.  The stand out in the film is Ricardo Montalban's villain Khan, a performance equally as devilishly evil as his Ludwig in The Naked Gun.  Khan is hell bent and twisted with a desire for revenge which Ricardo plays out very well.  It's easy to see why the character has become a classic in sci-fi bad guy lore.\nThe action is a little bit on the daft side with some obvious camera titling while folk throw themselves on the floor but the duelling spaceships are all good fun and the threat that Khan poses to the Earth is of a suitably galactic proportion.\nThe Wrath of Khan might not convert everyone into becoming a Trekkie but it is a very solid film and it's very clear to see why those who have an emotional attachment to the series and characters would hail it as a classic.

This is a script! And the director did a wonderful job here (for an 80's movie). The music score also was brilliant including that \"AMAZING GRACE\" piece *smiles* Really, 4 stars of 5. The plot and sub-plot was fantastic and it was never slow like the first \"meh\" movie (meh? See my review for the Motion Picture to know why). \n\nKhan story is fantastic and his point of view is even deeper but when you hear the one of Kirk, and mixed them up, it's mind blowing! Superb job! Cannot spoil a thing but seriously, watch it, I do recommend this movie! Hope the 3rd one is even better and visually more stunning than this one and the 'meh first one' hehe. \n\nEnjoy and HASTA LA PROXIMA AMIGOS/AS DU 7th L'ART! BLESS YOU ALL AND WISH YOU LUCK THIS 2013! - February 5, 2013.",

Love the pace, the tension, the tactics and Montalban is superb. All very convincing, as ST can be. You don't have to be a Trekkie to like this, which is probably the best measure of it's quality. J.J. Abrams needs to watch this version carefully...",

I like how it ties in with the original series with Khan returning from his exile, and how fueled he is by his vengeance on Kirk.  I think it gives the film a very personal feel to it, a very driven plot.  I also enjoyed the themes on death and resurrection, and growing old.  I think Wrath of Khan is a tremendously strong film.",

Perhaps it's because I'm not that big of a Trekkie but despite the fact that I enjoyed it and I think it's overall a really good movie, I can't help but feel disappointed because for me, this is only qualifies as \"good\" not GREAT as many people have said. Frankly, I prefer \"First Contact\" and the Abrams reboot over this.",
