            "content": "After watching this masterpiece again finally last night and after reviewing Patton on a couple different platforms last night, and after thinking of it a bit more today while working, I just cannot say enough good things about this film!  So very many movies of today and of the past 11 years are just not worth seeing and so many movies are just pushed out as fast as possible without much thought and without much creativity like say Black Adam and yet another CGI based movie released for no reason!\n\n52 years ago, when Patton was released, there wasn't any CGI of course and a director and his team had to be creative on special effects such as Star Wars mastered in 1977!  7 yrs after Patton was released.  I appreciate such films that much more now and I just wished the rest of the world did too.  Far too many people just do not know a good movie though and maybe do not even know their own backside.\n\nMovies like Patton and Saving Private Ryan and a handful of other great war films are just so very rare now, sadly!\n\nSign of the new times though unfortunately as even movie watching has become lazy too!  Many will be on their phone but still will say that they \"saw\" the movie!  Come on, who are you kidding?!!!  Ask those same people 10 questions on the movie they attended and I am willing to bet that they score only 10 to 20% max!\n\nWith Patton, it is cinematography at its finest and is a very interesting movie with some great battle scenes too without ANY dumbass CGI!\n\nLoved it, 10 out of 10 all day long!  Any real true movie fan can attest to this fact!",

Patton is nearly three hours in length but the film is so well written and the script so brilliantly acted that the running time flies by. The film would go on to win 7 Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Actor for Scott as Patton at the 1970 Academy Awards, Scott however refused to accept the reward as he deemed the event as corrupt and meaningless and hated the character of the man he portrayed in Patton.",

Scott's portrayal of General Patton was so true to the essence of the man that it is hard to find another performer who would have been able to capture the essence of who he was ( even if Patton himself did not sound so gruff in tone in real life! ). Patton also beautifully contrasts Patton the 'hero' and the 'villain' and the inevitable tension inside each of us. It also shows the reality of when ego and ambition can blend well with strategy and when it can't blend so well. The supporting cast to Scott's Patton helped to pull the strands of this movie into one beautiful tapestry. Karl Malden's performance as General Omar Bradley really helped give a counterweight to the at times insufferable pre-madonna tendencies of Patton. Karl Michael Vogler, sadly did give a forgettable performance of Erwin Rommel which did a great injustice to such a giant of combat history. This was a tremendous triumph for Francis Ford Coppola and definitely one of the best films ever to come out of American cinema, perhaps even, the best film of all time.",

            "content": "With one of the most iconic opening shots in cinematic history, Patton is a semi-biopic wrapped into a war movie featuring a phenomenal, dynamic performance. George C. Scott plays our titular character, a man not only born to be a general of massive armies and epic battles, but a man (re)born to be said general. What I loved about General Patton was how interesting of a man he was — he knew history (military history, at least), believed in reincarnation, he was surprisingly charming, and spoke French. He was multilayered; a curmudgeon (and that's putting it lightly) sometimes, a sympathetic \"fish out of water\" at others. The \"Russian Army\" scene portrays both his irascibility and charm back-to-back, in the blink of an eye. We also see the general's dark side when, after looking out on a field of fresh corpses (both American and German), he says to those within earshot, \"My God, I love it.\" Had the general gotten his way, he would've taken the 3rd Army straight across Eastern Europe to the walls of the Kremlin. The film is full of practical effect battle scenes and gorgeous shots of the various locales Patton and his troops encountered, even if most of the scenes in North Africa and Sicily were actually shot in Spain. The movie is almost three hours long, but I can't think of too much, if anything, I would cut. I also enjoyed that even during the 1940s, during the height of American involvement in WWII, the media were complete and total bastards — times don't change. Patton won Best Pic, Best Director, and Best Actor at the 43rd Academy Awards, to which George C. Scott famously rejected his very merited Oscar (which he stated beforehand), calling the whole charade \"a goddamn meat parade\" — times don't change. Start it for that big ass flag, stay for Scott. Watch this movie.",

Never mind its three hours, I dreaded coming to the end of \"Patton\" because Scott and the material make Patton, the man, bigger than life. Which is exactly what he was, from all accounts, a fascinating, one-of-a-kind character of dynamic extremes: a glory-hungry, hilariously/tragically deluded -- yet at times, self-reflective, self-effacing -- master of battle strategy. For anyone whoever pushed too hard thinking outside the box and got slapped, you will adore this sometimes jingoistic, but mostly wry, balanced portrait of a socially inept, often wrong-headed renegade ready to risk it all for his personal vision. Speaking as a confirmed dove myself, the movie succeeds in no small part because it's set in WWII, and not in what many might decry as an unjustifiable bloodbath like the Phillipines, Vietnam or Iraq. No doubt the chest-pounding Patton would have rationalized those wars, too.",

While not a film about his life entirely, Patton follows the beloved foul-mouthed military man (George C. Scott) during the battles of Kasserine Pass, El Guettar, and the Bulge. Much like Lawrence of Arabia, the movie also focuses on the cumulous points of view on General Patton, declaring him insane and over-his-head. Unlike David Lean's masterpiece where T.E. Lawrence had a balanced and clean persona, Franklin Schaffner's demonstrates Patton's blood-soaked, hard, iron fist, making the controversial viewpoints more credible. Also, unlike Lawrence, Patton's incidents on-screen historically happened, such as shooting the mules on his trip to Messina, a handful of smacking casualties' faces and threats to execute them for their cowardice. It's unbelievable to see a film based on a well-respected general to be that brutal, yet fascinating for its honesty. However in the grand scheme of things, there are a handful of artistic liberties taken with Patton. For instance, General Patton never wore all these medals during the opening speech. While on the subject, the dialect of that speech is toned down so the movie would become more accessible and avoid an R rating. However, those don't halt Patton's reputation as one of the best war films and biography films ever made. \n\n(5 Declined Best Actor Wins out of 5)",

From the terrific opening scene where he presents war with the American flag as his background and to the many fighting sequences. Patton is at times not a man to like, but a man to respect. From the famous slapping a soldier scene which shocked many to the guts to push his army further than many thought possible. He loves war and believes people live and die to become heroes. The competition to beat the English army to Mezzino is an interesting history lesson which is like we are America and we are better than you. The many links to history punctures Patton's ideas about war which gives the film the clear essence of war and about how war does not change that much. The fighting scenes are loud and very brutal. We see the after mass so many times, the dead bodies and the devastation of areas that after a while it doesn't become shocking it becomes common place. As Patton says he was a son a bitch but respected and feared by the Germans. The locations and wide angle shots show the great cinematography as the army delve closer and closer to Germany into France. The film might bore people with the many tactical discussions on the war. Patton is a contradiction, a very religious man but very much a case of war is everything and believing his own hype. He is a not politician and only understands war. The film is slightly too long but with George C Scott creating an unflinching character that became a symbol for  what the American army its a great movie.",

Patton is not a particularly likable fellow, but Scott's portrayal of him is so engrossing that you find yourself rooting for him anyway. The other characters are not nearly as complex or fleshed out, but with a running time of almost 3 hours, there was hardly space for it. Despite this, kudos should also be given to Karl Malden as General Omar Bradley. His was a fine performance. Patton fights as much for duty and love of country as he does for adoration and recognition. I found myself snickering as he preened over some new medals the way Suzanne Sugarbaker would show off a new tiara! He loves the pageantry of war and service as much as the undesired necessity of it.\n\nVisually, the film is extraordinary with brilliant use of wide angle location shots from around the world. There is also great attention to scale, and Scott is often filmed as being engulfed by his surroundings, much as Patton became engulfed by his inability to \"play the game\".

            "content": "It seems misleading to say Patton is a biography of General George S. Patton; that might lead one to expect a film that tells the story of the man's life from childhood to death, and that isn't what Franklin J. Schaffner's award-winning movie does. Rather, the story concerns Patton's role during World War II between 1943 and 1945 (it ends some months short of his death), whilst the plot is entirely about his personality and his attitude to – or rather relationship with – war. The film is focalised through Patton to the exclusion of almost everything else: he appears in the vast majority of scenes, and those in which he doesn't appear feature other people talking about him.  Thus, the film isn't so much about Patton's life, but rather Patton the man.\nAnd it is Patton the man as depicted here that is the key to the film's success. Partly this is due to the script: co-written by Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North (who, remarkable, never actually met until they received the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay), it exercises some artistic license to take the facts and myths about Patton's career and from them create a fascinating character. Patton as depicted here is endless fascinating: he lives for war and positively revels in it, at one actually admitting as much whilst seemingly aware that this sets him apart from his fellow soldiers. He leads his men from the front, or at least much closer to it that most officers at that time did. Whether this is bravery or insanity is hard to say: the writers neatly contrast him with British General Montgomery, whose careful planning and caution is juxtaposed with Patton's recklessness and desire to steal glory for himself. Impressively, the script makes Patton look as irresponsible as he is heroic: his superiors are not impressed by his selective interpretation of his orders on Sicily and his claims that he simply wants to stop Montgomery from monopolising the war glory sounds exactly like the weak justification for risking his men's lives that it is.\nThis, almost paradoxically, is what makes the character of Patton so interesting. Whilst undoubtedly impressive in many respects, he is profoundly flawed in others.  His belief that he is a reincarnation of past warriors makes him seem delusional, raising questions about whether such a man should be in command. His judgement is demonstrably flawed, such as when he accidentally insults Britain and America's Russian allies whilst giving a speech in England. He is pragmatically brutal, whether he's telling his men to make the enemy die for his country or callously shooting two mules and having them dragged out of his men's way whilst their owner looks on aghast. And most memorably, his career is briefly derailed when he viciously slaps a serviceman and has him thrown out of a field hospital, denouncing the man's shell-shock as cowardice; Patton is not portrayed as a man who understands or empathises with mental illness and although he is later forced to apologise, it sounds hollow.  Patton may be an American hero, but he was also an egomaniac and a self-confessed warmonger.\nThe fact that in spite of this the audience is inclined to both like and sympathise with him is due largely to the performance of George C. Scott. A Hollywood maverick who famously refused to accept his Academy Award for Best Actor, Scott wasn't Schaffner's first choice as leading man, but it is now impossible to imagine anyone else in the role. Scott was a Method actor of sorts who meticulously researched the role, and he completely immerses himself in it to the extent that a member of the production crew later recalled that at times he thought he was Patton. The result is utterly convincing and he makes Patton simultaneously larger than life and also entirely human. His fit of rage when he slaps the serviceman is terrifyingly convincing; so too is his humility and contrition later in the film when he practically begs his former subordinate and now commanding officer Bradley to give him a command. Scott makes Patton seem sympathetic, his respect for his enemy Rommel seeming impressively noble, his rivalry with Montgomery almost mischievous, and his disappointment in his rather meek dog endearing. \nSchaffner allows Scott to dominate the film, right from the unforgettable opening monologue in which Patton address both his men and the audience from in front of a huge American flag. It is a speech that Scott refused to give until the director lied to him and told him it would be included at the end of the film, since he felt that it would overshadow the rest of his performance; it doesn't, but he's so mesmerising whilst delivering it that one can understand why he was worried. Schaffner never allows the other cast members to come close to overshadowing Scott: there are some fine actors here, most notably Karl Michael Vogler as Rommel, Michael Bates as Montgomery and – especially – Karl Malden as Bradley, but whilst none of them puts a foot wrong, their characters are written such that they only ever serve to hold up a mirror to that of Patton.\nIn all respects, Patton is an accomplished of filmmaking: the cinematography makes the carnage of battle almost picturesque, for example during Patton's defeat of Rommel's forces at Battle of El Guettar, and the film looks glorious, thanks in no small part to its locations. Jerry Goldsmith's Oscar-nominated soundtrack is also a triumph, by turns rousing and oddly unsettling. But despite the copious talents of everybody involved, Patton will always be remembered first and foremost as George C. Scott's greatest performance, and rightly so.",

            "content": "War movies may be my least favorite genre of film followed swiftly by the formulaic biopic, this film combines both to produce a handsomely mounted but ultimately empty film. Much like An American in Paris (1951) this film does contain one sequence that you absolutely should watch but in this film it's the first scene instead of the last and it's only five minutes long not eighteen minutes. This is a film that could have easily been cut down by about eighty minutes and that was undeserving of the Best Picture Academy Award it earned in 1970, it deserves praise for that one scene and it's incredible production values but it's not a film that I would recommend putting yourself through.\n\nGeorge S. Patton, George C. Scott, is a mad, war hungry general who leads the United States military American II Corps from 1943 to 1945 as they face off against the German army lead by Erwin Rommel, Karl Michael Vogler. He faces harsh repercussions for his questionable actions such as slapping a crying soldier and ordering he report to the front line but his love for war remains his motivation throughout and he is held back by nothing in being present and in power during the battles. The Germans nervously speculate about him as his myth becomes more popular but he is undeterred by human adversaries.\n\nMy biggest issue with the film was that the character that the film focuses all of it's attention upon isn't particularly deep, he loves war more than anything else, and yet we are forced to spend three hours with him as this one point is continuously reinforced. The film would have been wise to settle on a tone as well as I assumed from the comedic tone of the first scene that the film was a satire and yet we were meant to feel genuinely sorry for Patton as he laments the fact that he can't participate in war. The film doesn't make any real comment or have any perspective on Patton as a figure or the implications of war. When considering that Francis Ford Coppola wrote this I expected something with even a fraction of the brilliance of Apocalypse Now (1979) but this was missing all of the dark humor and horror that made that film such a definitive statement on the Vietnam War. \n\nI think Patton would have been entertaining if he were a supporting character in a film from the perspective of another character. At his best moments he felt like something out of Catch-22 but Scott's enjoyable but one note performance becomes tiresome after we spend over an hour with him, a little bit of Scott goes a long way but too much of him can be fatal. Great satires like Nashville (1975) know to use their most eccentric characters sparingly as Geraldine Chaplin's Opal appears briefly but gets some of the funniest and deceptively meaningful lines in the film. Patton could have been used similarly as a symbol of all that's absurd about war and the people who can't live without it, I would have been perfectly happy with Scott winning the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for fifteen minutes of screen time. \n\nThe impressive part of the film is the opening scene as you get the stunning, memorable image of a pristine American flag and a defiant, militant Patton saluting a rapt audience. His opening monologue is fantastic as he spits out the sort of lines you would expect from Robert Duvall in Apocalypse Now (1979) and Scott gets a chance to unleash that iconic voice so full of anger and vitriol. I was amazed by the very brief moment and throughout I admired the cinematography, attention to period detail and the choreography and shooting of the battle scenes but I just didn't care about any of the people involved.\n\nI'd say that Five Easy Pieces (1970) was the deserving Best Picture winner of the films nominated against Patton because it's an intimate character study that teaches you something about the main character whilst also being consistently entertaining. I also believe that Melvyn Douglas should have won the Academy Award for Best Actor instead of Scott. Watch the first five minutes of the film and then stop because the rest of the film's not worth the time.",

Planning and carrying out a battle (incredibly filmed), and then Patton posturing, barking, and giving the same misty gab about battles in history, Carthaginians, pseudo reincarnation, and ‘being there’ himself. By the midpoint I could call every scene and when he’d say ‘Carthaginian’. The narrative goes nowhere. Finally, in the second half, it becomes meaningful and deeper storytelling, and a great film. And for a film made at the height of the Vietnam war, it goes to great length to be as middle of the road as possible. I appreciate the multiple viewpoints the script allows you to see this through. But when does that become a cop out because you want to make a popular film? (Oh one minor gripe... when Patton tears down the soldier’s pinup, the model looks straight out of a 1969 advertisement. Why is it hard to have accuracy in these little things?)",

            "content": "Patton a military genius and considered Hollywood accurately portrays one of the best WWII generals in the production of the movie Patton. It showed all of his significant achievement and correctly displayed the intensity that he explained to his soldiers. This also was one of his flaws he had a dirty mouth and a temper towards cowards. All men have flaws though, but only the strong ones know how to control and handle their mistakes. Patton showed this after he had his outrage on a soldier who was too scared to fight and had to apologize before being stripped of his campaign.  One might argue that his flaws were still too large, and he never overcame that, but one must watch the movie and do some research to decide.\nPatton the movie focused on his military service and his campaigns in WWII. His tactics are sometimes questioned due to his firm and sometimes violent actions towards his troops. He also had a significant and dirty mouth and used profane language often; this is shown in the speech he delivered at the beginning of the movie. One might take his screaming and cursing as an offense, but others find it motivational and are sometimes a great tactic to rial up troops before and in battle. He might have had questionable methods, but his tactics are still studied by generals today. His passion for tanks was shown in his battle plans and the tank uniforms he wanted the army to use but got turned down. He finally got repaired when the military named the first new tank after the war M48 Patton. \nHe was also believed very strongly in his religion and god. A part of the movie showed him praying for good weather tzo move his troops and fight the battle and the next day the conditions were perfect. This did not happen but was a way Hollywood could show interestingly to show his religious side. One might complain about the made-up seance, but it makes it a movie with entertainment, not just a boring documentary, so some events were made up to make the film more enjoyable. \nWeather Patton is a villain or a hero he would not care which as long as he could get there fist and beat Hitler and the Germans he would claim. This movie is for a very mature audience containing language and violence, but anyone who has a strong passion for history and WWII would enjoy the film, Patton. The movie is historically correct for most seance which can be rare in Hollywood, and it shows the extraordinary life of the 4-star general Patton.",

            "content": "Patton is the greatest character study of a general ever.\n\nDirector Franklin J. Schaffner's Patton (1970) is the greatest war film ever made. It takes the idea that General Patton was complex as he was raving mad with fervent energy by the end of World War II, but he also won the war for the Allied powers. Patton is patriotic in that it argues we need driven men like Patton during wartime, but it also admits he was a flawed figure. Patton is more pro-war in these aspects, while simultaneously showing the mass deaths of American troops and failing morale.\n\nGeorge C. Scott was born to play General George S. Patton. He plays the character of General Patton with great dexterity and calculated manner. Scott is the reason to watch Patton as the entire viewing experience gets devoted to watching Scott just act. It's a nuanced character study like no other. You are fascinated by the man that was Patton. Direct in his demeanor, intense in his manners, or lack thereof, you are hypnotized by his figure. George C. Scott captures Patton's patriotism, heroism, poeticism, glory, insanity, drive, strategy, and historical knowledge. He was truly a complex American hero.\n\nScott plays Patton with a sense of patriotism that defines Patton. Meanwhile, Scott also portrays Patton's erratic nature in his tendency to fly off the rail barking orders or scolding soldiers. Patton is the best war film for its use of strategy and planning ahead for victory, deep character study of General Patton, and thoughtful reflection on the costs of war. Patton was likely insane, but also a genius tactician. His guile led to many notable victories in combat that changed the tides of battle during his war. Patton even shows the dead and wounded soldiers that Scott's portrayal acknowledges were pushed to the edge of their strength. Scott gives the performance of a lifetime displaying Patton's growing madness alongside his brazen persona that alludes to the impending violence Patton would order. Patton is brilliantly acted by George C. Scott.\n\nPatton is beautifully shot with soaring cinematography from Fred J. Koenekamp. The camera will be placed atop a car or tank, then suddenly below Patton. The camera placements choices are fascinating and always entertaining. The center framed camera shot opening Patton is genius having Patton directly address the audience with his beliefs. Francis Ford Coppola's script directly takes quotes from the actual General Patton and finds a realistic portrayal of this icon of Americana. Jerry Goldsmith's score is exciting and reflective with army melodies scattered throughout and darker sounds to emphasize the stranger Patton moments.\n\nYou get it all with Patton! George C. Scott barks out orders, negotiates over the telephone, scans over his men like a meticulously, cruel sentry. His gaze meant you were about to be scolded or ordered and his men would listen. On the other hand, Karl Malden's General Bradley is the voice of reason and empathy next to Scott's relentless Patton. They play off of each other wonderfully with a kinetic energy.\n\nIn short, Patton is a character study into the mind of a genius, whose driven madness lead the Allied Powers to victory due to his war service. It is worth watching for the opening monologue from George C. Scott's Patton alone.",

I loved how the film focused in on this character, established his personality early, and then showed the arc of his journey through World War II.  George C. Scott is the only man for this role, and I loved every minute of his performance.  From the brash speeches to those moments when he was humbled, I was completely invested in this character.  I struggled following exactly what was going on in the war at any given moment because they made little jumps forward so often that I didnt know what had happened.  Its like the movie is a series of amazing vignettes, but they struggled with some of the story-telling in between.  Also a few of the actual war scenes get quite muddled because it doesnt seem like they maintain the 180 degree rule, so I lose track of which army Im watching and whos winning.  However, the movie is less about the war and more about the titular character, and I think they nailed the portrayal of the man.  He was a controversial character, and the movie never takes sides on whether the ends justify the means when it comes to his methods of commanding troops.  I thought Patton was an excellent biopic, and one Ill gladly watch over many other war films, because it is so focused and character-driven.  Definitely my kind of movie.",

I think it's brilliant how this is a movie about war yet, the gorgeous landscapes and nature are appreciated and respected through cinematography. Very wise man Patton.\n\nThe music compliments the movie very well. It almost reminds me of Kubrick's choice of music. Seeing those troops approach from off in the distance was a sight to see. Definitely built the tension up very well. And brilliant how strategically placed all the American artillery and tanks were. Watching that battle unfold was almost watching a good game of chess being played.\n\nPatton is such an interesting character. The more you find out about him and his beliefs, the way he views things in a past history sense, the more you start liking him. I find him more and more intersting as the story progresses. The flaw that gets in his way though is that he has an ego and desperately is trying to prove how boss he is. When asked, \"You find time t oread the Bible?\", he says \"Every goddamn day\". Hahaha clever and witty guy. No doubt, he 's a man that gets things done and I admire that about him. It's very intersting to see the differences between Patton and the other general's. He's not a bad guy and you can see it in the way that he cares about his troops especially when he visits the hospital. He just let's his glory-thirsty ways get in the middle of his judgment is all. I love what General Bradley tells Patton when they have that argument. He tells him, \"I'm fighting this war because I was trained to do it. Your fighting this war because you love it\". Brilliant line. Pretty much sums it all up.\n\nThese son of a bitch journalists and news reporters always have to stir the pot ehh? It's a bit tough seeing Patton get knock down a size and sort of put into his place. Not being able to do anything because of probation sucks.\n\nOverall, terrific and wonderful movie about war and many other things that come with war. I think Patton was a brilliant character and almost impossible not to be interested in him and his journey as well as who he is. I'm watching this one again.",

Patton and his many exploits during World War II; focusing mostly on the man himself and his absolute love of the battlefield. George C. Scott flawlessly embodies this character, opening the film with an amazing, one-take monologue addressing his unseen troops, which rose the bar of the film's caliber straight from the get-go. It isn't so much a straight-forward war film, as the real meat of this movie is in Patton's strategic meetings for combat and his vain willingness to screw over fellow comrades to be victorious. His notoriety comes from his treatment of his soldiers as expendable needs-to-an-end and his inability to not speak his mind constantly gets him in trouble; especially when the press are around. One of the more surprising aspects of this film is that famed director, Francis Ford Coppola wrote the screenplay and he really did a great job! Another fun fact is that George C. Scott won the Academy Award for Best Actor for this role, but turned it down due to his disapproval of the awards ceremony. Patton is a very interesting piece of history that while pretty long at 3 hours, holds your attention due to Scott's performance and the unexpected humour this film had made it much more enjoyable to sit through than I expected!",

Patton had become famous for infamous wars early in his career and always had issues with the Russians, following orders, and keeping his big mouth shut.  We watch as Patton ages he becomes more of a political figurehead than soldier, primarily due to his immature behavior.  He seeks opportunities to get back on the front lines when America enters World War II.  \n\n\"Americans, tradionally, love to fight.\"\n\nFranlin Shaffner, director of Planet of the Apes, Papillon, Lionheart, Welcome Home, The Double Man, Islands in the Stream, Sphinx, and The Good Years, delivers Patton.  The storyline for this picture is very interesting and delivers a larger than life, charismatic, and over the top character...I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The cast delivers excellent performances and includes George C. Scott, Karl Malden, Michael Strong, Bill Hickman, and Morgan Paull.\n\n\"I don't want these men to love me.  I want them to fight for me.\"\n\nI have been wanting to see this for a while and DVR'd it off Turner Classic Movies (TCM).  This screenplay was written by the legend Francis Ford Coppola.  I really enjoyed how Patton was both delivered and portrayed.  This is a very well done picture that is worth your time and borderline worth adding to your classic film collection.\n\n\"If we're not victorious, let not one come back alive.\"\n\nGrade: A",

Coppola and North had to tone down Patton's actual words and statements in the scene, as well as throughout the rest of the film, to avoid an R rating; in the opening monologue, the word \"fornicating\" replaced \"fucking\" when he was criticizing The Saturday Evening Post. Also, Scott's gravelly and scratchy voice is the opposite of Patton's high-pitched, nasal and somewhat squeaky voice, a point noted by historian S.L.A. Marshall. However, Marshall also points out that the film contains \"too much cursing and obscenity [by Patton]. Patton was not habitually foul-mouthed. He used dirty words when he thought they were needed to impress.\"\n\nWhen Scott learned that the speech would open the film, he refused to do it, as he believed that it would overshadow the rest of his performance. Director Schaffner assured him that it would be shown at the end. The scene was shot in one afternoon at Sevilla Studios in Madrid, with the flag having been painted on the back of the stage wall.\n\nAll the medals and decorations shown on Patton's uniform in the monologue are replicas of those actually awarded to Patton. However, the general never wore all of them in public and was in any case not a four-star general at the time he made the famous speeches on which the opening is based. He wore them all on only one occasion, in his backyard in Virginia at the request of his wife, who wanted a picture of him with all his medals. The producers used a copy of this photo to help recreate this \"look\" for the opening scene.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe film was shot in 65mm Dimension 150 by cinematographer Fred J. Koenekamp and has a music score by Jerry Goldsmith.\n\nPatton won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture.\n\nThe opening monologue, delivered by George C. Scott as General Patton with an enormous American flag behind him, remains an iconic and often quoted image in film. The film was successful, and in 2003, Patton was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\".\n\n\nman this is such an amazingly brilliant movie 2 watch with such a brilliant cast throughout this movie.......it is such an enjoyable movie 2 watch with a brilliant cast throughout this movie.......",

It has brains and bronze, which is hard to come by with a war film. Balance of acting and action comes with this tale of bravery and audacity. There are epic battles. Tragedy within Patton's inner circle of officers. A descriptive and dramatic story written by Francis Ford Coppola. You may remember him as directing a film called...uh...The Godfather (1972)! And a patriotic and moving score by the famous composer Jerry Goldsmith. All of these movie making elements make for a great product, which I say is the best World War II biopic in cinema history.\n\nGeorge C. Scott does a terrific and convincing portrayal of the American general who was too aggressive and politically outspoken, which got him in trouble on the battle field and with the media. Scott gave Patton a personality that was flawed, and that is what we need to see. An imperfect hero. It keeps the audience active and entertained when the film takes us away from the front lines. It transfers smoothly between peace and war scenes. And he shines in front of that American flag none-the-less!\n\nI want to mention that the role of Karl Malden as General Omar Bradley was a triumph! He plays opposite of Patton; that is exactly what he is, Patton's opposite. Malden gives Bradley a regular man vibe as we see Scott give Patton a persona of a military tycoon. Bradley brings Patton back to reality, or tries to anyway. Any tension that we feel facing Patton, Bradley comes in to remind Patton that he's not God and to look at the bright side. It is a successful sharing of screen time and character development as we see these two friends go through the entire North African and European theaters together. And each decision they make effects the other. It is as if we went through the war with them. If you love and hate General Patton, then Franklin J. Shaffner did his job. You really have to hate and love Patton as the protagonist. That's what you have to do with a general sometimes.",

He hogs the spotlight and it's a better movie because of it. He's tough and intimidating and brutally honest and old fashioned, but at the same time he's non-threatening, inspiring and inspired. The movie is basically a character study of what it means to be a virtuous man. Patton isn't perfect, but the movie isn't shy about slapping him on the wrist when he's not being a very good role modal. Scott plays the character with a light-hearted sense of humor and for me tat's what most stood out, which is why I see it as a comedy. At times it almost it feels like a Christmas movie. He allows himself to be as self-mockingly soft as he can be without losing his tough, military demeanor. Not only does Patton teach you that truth, determination and strength of character is a reward in itself, it also teaches that there's a right way and a wrong way to be a leader. Patton's tactics on dealing with troop morale teaches a valuable lesson; the conflict and the resolve.",

Patton (Scott, unforgettable as the controversial American general), and his contentious orders and remarks during his command. Sensational lead, masterly done all around; an absolute must. Screenplay by Francis Ford Coppola, and Edmund H. North. One of the all-time greatest biopics, and one of the best films of the 1970s. Winner of Seven Oscars for Picture, Actor, Director, Script, Art Direction-Set Decoration, Editing, and Sound. Fred J. Koenekamp's cinematography, and Jerry Goldsmith's scoring are certainly worthy of praise.\n\nOn a technical side, the first time I saw Franklin J. Schaffner's \"Patton\" I felt an exhilaration beyond words. On a good day, I think \"The Godfather\" is the top film of the decade (1970s), on a bad day, I think it's Patton. \"Patton\" was, and still remains an important classic, and contemporary war drama. It was a landmark of the early 70s, seeing it now, it holds all its grip towards one of the great moviegoing experiences. 4/4.",

Graphic, brutal, dark and took many chance's with it's shocking scenes that left many people cold and speechless. Until one late night when this movie came on TV and I only heard a couple of things about it but nothing much. So I was there acting all cocking thinking \"Oh classic movie eh? well blow my mind classic movie\", then I started to watch and I really got into it, to the point where I understand why people raving this has a classic and this movie was a lot different then the other 70's movies at the time. It's a World War film with some amazingly well shot scenes of the battlefield and the horrifying impact that everybody had to go through.\n\nGeorge C. Scott was just terrific in this movie playing George S. Patton. I didn't see George C. Scott in this role, I just saw the real guy in front of me and he completely disappeared in this role and became the real thing, and that's just top notch to me.\n\nThe cinematography in this movie looks like it took a long time to get the perfect shot and needed the right timing, and for that I give the cinematography team respect for actually trying to get the right shot. The directing and the writing has well was pretty stellar and freaking well done.\n\nFor problems I only have one and that is: The movies paste can drag a little and... really that's it. \n\nOverall Patton is a brilliant war film with excellent acting and outstanding cinematography.",

Scott as Patton my goss he owns it his strong tough acting followed by his surprising sympathetic style has left me amazed making not just one of my favorite character in movies but as a real life person, though he is harsh but that how he was a tough general who keeps pushing forward towards even though it will hurt him even if its over and it also shows how brutal world war 2 was allowing him to push harder never backing down and surprisingly it kind of shows he cares for his soldiers.",

The film lays out a lot of information to the main character in 178 minutes, but it seems like a respectful way to honor him for what he has done in history. The writing is terrific, and the film is pretty factual from what I read in the history books which some of the events are quite shocking that you would never thought that Patton did that. The film shows how Patton is famous and that the soldiers would fight to the death with him as the main character really wanted to end the war, no matter the cost. They don't make Patton too unlikeable as he gives out some funny moments or actually apologizes for some of his actions, and the battle scenes look really good and realistic. Patton is quite an experience to watch that there is no other film, that's related to General Patton, can be better than this, and there's no other actor that can play it better than George C.

I came into this film like an empty vessel and letting the film shape my perspective of the character and what I got was certainly satisfying.\n\nThe film shows us that Patton was a driven man; he wanted to be ranked up there along with the notable names in the history of war. It also shows us his life values and his expectations from his soldiers in order to win the war. This character and his story could have been an easy person to hate, as we are given sides of him that weren't exactly pleasing to watch, like his verbal abuse towards his soldiers and his rebellious nature, but Coppola and North, the film's writers, handled his story in such a way that maintains our sense of sympathy towards him. They let us in deep with the character in order for us to completely understand his actions.\n\nI was also happy to find that the film avoids heavy sentimentality as similarly crafted films and subjects tend to be dampened in order to manipulate our feelings towards the characters. I am not the easiest person to convince when it comes to war films as it takes me awhile to understand the non-fictional aspects and thematic concerns, but Patton was handled beautifully ensuring that it is more about the character rather than the situation, allowing the film to feel accessible.\n\nSchaffner allows the film to slowly build, comprehensively explore the titular character in order to have its third act feel more impacting. This film has also got me interested in trying out other films from Franklin J. Schaffner, hoping maybe they would be just as powerful as this film.\n\nThe film's photography was impressive, giving us the glimpse of war through the eyes of the general and as a strategist; we see the fight at a distance, with only a couple of moments where it gets close to the action. The film also captures the drama of the film well, though there were a couple of moments where the shot felt too distant from the character and felt it needed a sense of intimacy.\n\nPatton featured a strong musical score by the legendary Jerry Goldsmith, who I adore for his work on Ridley Scott's Alien. The score was both patriotic and dramatic, and one of the key components in making this character come to life.\n\nThe film featured a worthy performance from George C. Scott, playing this man who is thick as ice in his exterior but also contains a slight interior vulnerability. I think my adoration for his performance would grow even further the more times I come back to this film. I wasn't able to focus so much on the rest of the cast, as I felt this film was a clear one man show.\n\nPatton is a film that almost won me over completely. If it weren't for its minor issues, I would have most likely added this to my list of Great Movies, but I think this film is headed to that direction anyways, all it needs is another viewing.

The main actor delivered a historic performance as General George S. Patton, which helps us to imagine the kind a man that he was (a great soldier, but am ambiguous human being). For a movie filmed in 1969, the set design and vision of war is really good and realistic; there was real effort put into it.

            "content": "The definitive biopic.  Based off Ladislas Farago's Patton: Ordeal and Triumph, and Omar Bradley's A Soldier's Story, Patton follows the life of US General George S. Patton during World War II, where he causes controversy while trying to strengthen his troops.  The biopic helped lay the groundwork for all biopics good and bad (why are there bad ones?  Are people this disrespectful to this person or something when they don't portray their life accurately in film?) by following the most significant events in the person's life that helped define them for who they are, and executing the events with finesse, which includes intelligence and emotion for a much-needed human feel.  Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North are able to respect Patton while also keeping the historical accuracy intact.  Franklin J. Schaffer is able to capture the look by adding in what made WWII a very dangerous time, and visiting and/or fighting in foreign countries.  Jerry Goldsmith finds the right time to use his score, which captures the mood of each scene to a fault.  Fred J. Koenekamp shoots every scene with finesse, while Hugh S. Fowler makes the final film what it is.  The best contribution to this masterpiece is George C. Scott in the iconic role.  Though he gave up his Oscar due to him disagreeing the idea of competing, he gives one of the best performances in film history, where he's able to capture the personality, look, and characteristics of Patton, making him live the role.  Patton is able to show how brave the general is, even during the worst times in war, including base attacks, where he doesn't hesitate at bringing down the enemy, whether it not he loses his life.   A must-see, and one of the best films ever made.",

            "content": "\"Rommel... I read your BOOK!\"\r\n\r\nIn 1970, people were sick of the Vietnam War and were not interested in seeing any war movies, especially films that supported the Vietnam War (such as John Wayne's highly controversial The Green Berets). But with the release of Patton, based on the famed and controversial military leader of WWII, it got people interested, and in the end, Patton was a highly acclaimed classic and ended up winning Best Picture, beating out Airport, Five Easy Pieces, Love Story, and MASH. With a legendary performance from George C. Scott in the title role, Patton is an unforgettable movie-going experience.\r\n\r\nGeneral George Patton (George C. Scott) is called to lead the American troops of North Africa. After getting them into shape, he leads the troops to fight the Germans, led by German Field Marshal Rommel (Karl Micherl Volger). Afterwards, Patton races to Italy, but controversy arises when Patton intends to have competition with British officer Montgomery (Michael Bates), intending to beat him to Sicily. But Patton's biggest challenge comes after slapping one of his soldiers for being a \"coward.\" People cried foul, and Patton nearly loses his job. But with the help of military friend  Bradley (Karl Malden), Patton takes command of the Third Army and leads them all through Europe to defeat the Nazis once and for all.\r\n\r\nFirst off, I applaud director Franklin J, Schaffner and his crew for realistically portraying the war. The battle scenes are wonderfully made (with no CGI), and show the dedication of the American troops and their fight for freedom. Scenes with young men killed in battle serve as moving and inspiring.\r\n\r\nJerry Goldsmith's score is outstanding. The now-famous trumpet echoes are highly original and leaves a lasting impact long after seeing the film. Also, the entire Patton theme is heroic and inspiring. Jerry Goldsmith is one of my favorite film composers, definitely in my Top 5, and Patton is one of his best scores, along with Planet of the Apes, The Mummy, and Star Trek: The Motion Picture.\r\n\r\nKarl Malden plays Patton's friend Bradley, who saves Patton's reputation, and his role is well-done. I view this as Malden's finest role, not his Oscar-winning performance in A Streetcar Named Desire. The way his character sticks up for Patton is what a true friend should do, even if the two officers disagree on military tactics. (\"I do it because I was trained to. You do it because you love it.\")\r\n\r\nYou can't review Patton without talking about George C. Scott's portrayal of the military hero, and in my opinion, Scott's performance is phenomenal. The character of Patton is one of the most fascinating military leaders of all-time, and Scott's performance delivers. Patton is a devout Christian, but believes in reincarnation and curses out his men in  order to get them in shape. Scott's tale on the character features him in the film's most memorable moments, such as the already-mentioned soldier slapping scene, a scene where Patton prays during a montage of war in the night, and in the most famous sequence, Patton's memorable opening speech to the Third Army. (\"Americans love to fight. It's in their blood.\") Some of the harsher language in this scene had to be toned down in order for the film to receive a PG rating (there was no PG-13 in 1970), but either way, that speech still carries out, making Patton one of the most unforgettable experiences in Hollywood history. \r\n\r\nOriginally, John Wayne was supposed to play Patton, but Wayne turned it down, probably due to his Vietnam controversy. John Wayne is good in his westerns, but had he played Patton, then the film would have been an epic disaster. People are born to do great things, and in the case of George C. Scott, he was born to play Patton, one of the greatest military leaders of all-time. George C. Scott won an Oscar for his role, and while he refused to accept the award, calling the Academy a \"meat-market\", I feel that his Oscar win was well-deserved.\r\n\r\nBut even with Scott's Oscar-winning performance, that doesn't mean that Patton is a perfect film. While Patton is a three-hour film, for me, it lacked proper character development. Even though we got to see Patton develop from a grumpy old man to a war hero, I wanted to see the character before his time in the war. I wanted to see his family life, his education, the reason why he believed in reincarnation, and how he joined the military and became a general. But in the end, I was still impressed with the film, even if I wanted to witness Patton's entire life.\r\n\r\nIt's been called the greatest war film ever made, and while I have a stronger preference to Sergeant York and The Longest Day, Patton is an unforgettable film extravaganza, with an epic Jerry Goldsmith score, a phenomenal and compelling performance from George C. Scott, and a heroic story. Say what you want about Patton, but Patton is the big reason why America still exists today. Without Patton, then the Nazis might have won, and with Scott's grand performance, everyone can witness the grand heroism of a fascinating military leader.",
