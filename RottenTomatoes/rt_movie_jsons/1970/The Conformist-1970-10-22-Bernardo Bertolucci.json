    "summary": "In Mussolini's Italy, repressed Jean-Louis Trintignant, trying to purge memories of a youthful, homosexual episode -- and murder -- joins the Fascists in a desperate attempt to fit in. As the reluctant Judas motors to his personal Gethsemane (the assassination of his leftist mentor), he flashes back to a dance party for the blind; an insane asylum in a stadium; and wife Stefania Sandrelli and lover Dominique Sanda dancing the tango in a working class hall. But those are only a few of this political thriller's anthology pieces, others including Trintignant's honeymoon coupling with Sandrelli in a train compartment as the sun sets outside their window; a bimbo lolling on the desk of a fascist functionary, glimpsed in the recesses of his cavernous office; a murder victim's hands leaving bloody streaks on a limousine parked in a wintry forest.",

The agent, a former student of the intended target, rekindles his friendship with the victim and falls in love with the target's beautiful wife, all while beginning to question his loyalty to the regime.  Once you get past the first half of the film, which may feel disjointed at times due to the number of flashbacks, Bernardo Bertolucci's The Conformist is a gripping political thriller about loyalty and self-doubt.  More importantly, it is filled with some truly stunning visuals thanks to Vittorio Storaro's beautiful cinematography and some bold directorial choices made by Bertolucci.  If interested in checking out Bertolucci's oeuvre, The Conformist is probably the place to start.",

Eventually his survival instincts for himself and his family kick in when Mussolini steps down and fascists are now on the receiving end of ideological violence. \nBertolucci bathes this psycho-drama in beautiful cinema-graphic effects which comes awfully close to blunting his fascist critique, but, in the end, the intensifies it.",

            "content": "In Paris, Marcello Clerici (Jean-Louis Trintignant) finalizes his preparations in assassinating his former college professor, Luca Quadri. It frequently returns to the interior of a car driven by Manganiello as the two of them pursue the professor and his wife. Through a series of flashbacks, he is seen discussing with his blind friend Italo his plans to marry, his somewhat awkward attempts to join the Fascist secret police, and his visits to his parents: a morphine-addicted mother at the family's decaying villa, and his unhinged father at an insane asylum. In another flashback, Marcello is seen as a boy during World War I, who finds himself in his family's wealth. He is humiliated by his schoolmates until he is rescued by Lino, a chauffeur. Lino offers to show him a pistol and then makes sexual advances towards Marcello, which he partially responds to before grabbing the pistol and shooting wildly into the walls and into Lino, then flees from the scene of what he assumes is a murder. In another flashback, Marcello and his fianc\u00e9e Giulia (Stefania Sandrelli) discuss the necessity of his going to confession, even though he is an atheist, in order for her Roman Catholic parents to allow them to marry. Marcello agrees and, in confession, admits to the priest to have committed many grave sins, including his homosexual intercourse with and subsequent murder of Lino, premarital sex, and his absence of guilt for these sins. Marcello admits he thinks little of his new wife but craves the normality that a traditional marriage with children will bring. The priest is shocked \u2014 and pruriently interested in Marcello's homosexual experience \u2014 but quickly absolves Marcello once he hears that he is currently working for the Fascist secret police, called Organization for Vigilance and Repression of Anti-Fascism. Marcello finds himself ordered to assassinate his old acquaintance and teacher, Professor Quadri, an outspoken anti-Fascist intellectual now living in exile in France. Using his honeymoon as a convenient cover, he takes Giulia to Paris where he can carry out the mission...\n\nVincent Canby, film critic for The New York Times, liked Bertolucci's screenplay and his directorial effort, and wrote, \"Bernardo Bertolucci...has at last made a very middle-class, almost conventional movie that turns out to be one of the elegant surprises of the current New York Film Festival... It is also apparent in Bertolucci's cinematic style, which is so rich, poetic, and baroque that it is simply incapable of meaning only what it says...The movie is perfectly cast, from Trintignant and on down, including Pierre Clementi, who appears briefly as the wicked young man who makes a play for the young Marcello. The Conformist is flawed, perhaps, but those very flaws may make it Bertolucci's first commercially popular film, at least in Europe where there always seems to be a market for intelligent, upper middle-class decadence.\" A review in Variety stated, \"For those who appreciate its subtleties, but also its subsurface power and great evocative qualities, it's a gem.\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and called it \"much more of a show than a story,\" with its narrative themes \"all but lost amid Bertolucci's splendid recreation of the era. In other words, if you are looking for fashion and furnishing hints, this is the place.\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times declared that the film \"places young Bernardo Bertolucci in the front ranks of Italian directors and among the finest film-makers working anywhere. In this dazzling film, Bertolucci, 30, manages to combine the bravura style of a Fellini, the acute sense of period of a Visconti and the fervent political commitment of an Elio Petri ('Investigation of a Private Citizen') with complete individuality and, better still, a total lack of self-indulgence.\" Gary Arnold of The Washington Post said that the film was \"an extraordinarily beautiful and spellbinding picture,\" but \"what's below the surface doesn't stand up to much analysis. I think this is true and that it amounts to a terrible flaw. The dramatic material, while intriguing, isn't adequately developed: many connecting or explanatory scenes appear to be missing (reading the original novel by Alberto Moravia restores some of these), the psychology of the most complex characters is murky, and the climactic and concluding scenes are positively trite.\" Jan Dawson of The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote, \"In his screen adaptation of Moravia's novel, Bertolucci has eliminated all explanations or analysed motivations, as well as any allusions to Marcello's life before the moment he first sees Lino ... The effort of these changes, in purely psychological terms, is to reduce Marcello's story to a model Freudian case history.\"\n\nThis arthouse film becomes a bit too arty and vague for me personally despite an interesting historical backstory with fascism and the OVRA as pillars. However, \"Il Conformista\" is like a dream sequence where nothing seems to be real and yet it\u00b4s supposed to be real, which in return shuts you out as a viewer. Yes, the cinematography and art direction are vivid, but it becomes more style over matter as the script is not hold together in a satisfying way. The dialogue becomes also a problem as Bertolucci present it in a way too theatrical manner making you not really embrace the spoken part of the film. Bertolucci is also trying a bit too hard to present all sorts of metaphors and philosophical ideas that becomes silly at the best. \n\"Il Conformista\" is not really my cup of tea. But, I must say that Stefania Sanderelli is quite stunning and her appearance caught my eye.",

Where Schindler's List focused on an antagonist that was capable of tremendous cruelty by virtue of simply being unempathetic and blood-chillingly evil, Bertolucci instead lampoons the weaknesses that allow terrible actions to be perpetrated rather than the activist outliers that make the speeches and agitate the masses. Trintignant's Marcello is fundamentally weak, drawn to his fascist position not by some misguided sense of benefit in order, but to quash his own past that he feels deeply ashamed of. The clarity of the images themselves is shocking given the production period, and the cinematography matches for creativity and artistry - Vincent Storaro creates an incredible piece of film that engages visually as much as it does narratively. My only complaint is the bizarre romantic attachment between Marcello and Sanda's Anna (as well as between Anna and Giulia), which seems rather out of place and unjustified. (4.5/5)",

Everyting is a lie and he destroys every possible friendship - just to get by, in a way. It looks splendid. The camerawork, the positioning og characters, the colors, the light, the movement. It's a pretty watch. The story is for me a bit too soft and political. There's not much else than this man dealing with a few girls and getting into some violence. There's a few rememorable scenes and most scenes are strong. OK character build up and an overall, smooth vibe, but it's not enough for me to give it a near perfect score. The non perfect re-added lip synching kills bits of the vibe. At times surreal but I still found it a pretty safe film.\n\nNot poor, by all means - the looks and presentation are magnificent.

How marvelously we are manipulated by the writer, the director, the cinematographer, the art and costume directors.  All that, to be face-to-face with cowardice, vile and deceitful \"normality\".  This is Moravia's take - brought to life by Bertolucci and his extraordinary crew - on a personal and intimate version of what Hannah Arendt would later call, in a different context, \"the banality of evil\".\n\nOne broad comment on Bertolucci to mark his passing.  I have always found his work to be diminished, not enhanced, by his fixation on sex and his Pasolini and Communist-inspired themes, and certainly his manipulation of Maria Schneider on the set of Last Tango in Paris was grotesque and wrong.  But we don't have to agree with or condone the artist's obsessions to appreciate his art.",

The Conformist is a thematically heavy movie, and I'm someone who is not mentally there for movies that require that intellect. I feel I missed something other than the obvious theme in the title.\n\nWhat I didn't miss though was the cinematography. Wow. It's a beautiful film. There's a great use of blue filter throughout, and the weaving back and forth between past and present has some mesmerizing images.\n\nI was fairly vested in this film, although I will admit I had to look through the wiki plot to recap several times. It's a film I really had to pay attention to.\n\nTo me The Conformist is good, but not quite the masterpiece that its status has gained. Then again, I may just be trying not to be the conformist himself.",

I think the key to this movie is understanding that our protagonist really has no will of his own, and simply going along with what others expect of him, hence the title. His character actually reminded me a lot of the titular character from Camus' The Stranger in that regard. I appreciated the artistry involved in making the film, especially the design of the office of the fascist bureaucracy. What bothered me about the film though are the constant shifts in tone. Now, the film was probably edited that way to underscore the hollowness of our titular bureaucrat, but I found it distracting. Overall, I appreciate the film more than I enjoyed it.",

            "content": "Like some other reviewers, I was not impressed by the writing and the way the narrative was presented. It felt very disconnected, and sometimes confusing, with rough jumps between scenes, often making characterisation deficient. Perhaps it was a conscious decision aimed to convey Marcello's neurotic state and his need to belong, yet I felt that the camera-work alone did the job pretty well, especially the lighting (e.g. in the scene when we first see Guilia, in a striped dress, with moving light source patterned by the blinds, it reflects Marcello's mixed feelings about her), and the unorthodox angles. Also, I still wander if the narrative is objective, or maybe some of the scenes are Marcello's wishful thinking - while watching, I had a theory that the blue light indicated these, but it didn't quite hold up till the end.\n\nAnd, next to the ambiguous episodes, there are some annoyingly blatant parts. The metaphor of blind fascists was just too in-your-face. I wont give examples, look them up, there are quite some. \n\nThe bit I liked about the plot was the suppressed homosexuality theme, under-stressed but sustained throughout the film with several moments of restrained homoeroticism, and the ending. I also liked the general air of the 30s, and the music - the credits song is currently stuck in my head.\n\nI'll quote a fellow reviewer here, who said something i fully agree with: ''A fine movie, but dry and difficult to relate to. I can't imagine many people calling this a favorite. I have a great deal of respect for its craftsmanship, above all, most notably because the filming is beyond gorgeous. ''\n\nOverall, while definitely a 9.5/10 for cinematography, The Conformist suffers from the need of a better and more coherent script. Which makes the movie sometimes very boring, confusing and frustrating. Maybe on a second viewing it might be better, but for now. 3/5 stars",

            "content": "In The Conformist, Marcello, the protagonist, is forced to come to terms with himself and discover his place in society. However, this is not an easy task as Marcello has difficulties balancing his childhood experiences with the modern day influences of Fascism. The events of his youth inspire him to scratch the life of the past and comply with accepted social conventions, such as marriage and adherence to the fascist government. Nevertheless, the reliance on these customs plunges Marcello into a life characterized by loneliness and alienation.\n\nTraumatizing events in Marcello's childhood inspire him to become a normal individual and seek belonging. In a flashback, Marcello's homosexual nature is displayed when a chauffeur, Lino, tries to seduce him. Instead of trying to escape this awkward situation, he chooses to be seduced and is comfortable with the idea of participating in homosexual acts. However, this confrontation is quickly nullified as Marcello tries to murder Lino. These two instances are not the only troubling things in Marcello's childhood. He felt the effects of seclusion due to his family's wealth, suffered brutal beatings and humiliations at school, and witnessed his mother abusing drugs. All of these occurrences in Marcello's childhood create the desire for him to become ordinary and evade isolation.\n\nMarcello tries to achieve the normalcy that he craves through marriage, but he fails to feel any belonging and escape his loneliness. By societal standards, men need to feel attracted to women to be considered normal. The societal pressures force him into making this decision to marry Giulia, a young bourgeois. Needing the consent of Giulia's parents, he must act against his will and go to confession even though he is an atheist. The true nature of Marcello's intentions are revealed when he freely admits that he doesn't think highly of Giulia. Throughout the film, he hardly has sex with her and often times neglects her. He even commits adultery, displaying his emotional detachment. These actions indicate that Marcello's only purpose for marriage is to conform to societal standards. Consequently, he fails to be a good husband and remains lonely.\n\nNext, Marcello attempts to adopt the role of a devoted fascist only to fail, again, at fitting in and escaping isolation. By abiding to the fascist regime, Marcello is attempting to become socially accepted. Marcello is sent on a mission to assassinate his old college mentor and friend Professor Quadri, an anti-fascist. He clearly does not want to murder his former professor but plans to do so anyway because he is lured by conformity. The decision to carry out the crime is the point at which he fails to become normal; murder is not something that is considered to be an established norm. By being a loyal fascist, Marcello hopes to fit in with the rest of society and evade loneliness, but he ultimately fails by committing a homicide.\n\nDespite the intentions of Marcello to become a normal citizen, he ends up failing miserably. He's supposed to be happy; he's supposed to feel like he belongs. However, the two roles that he assumed, married man and fascist, are the cause of his loneliness. A normal man would not cheat on his spouse, and he certainly wouldn't partake in a murder either. The marriage and fascist involvement do Marcello more harm than good. At the end of the film, he is not in the company of his wife or his fascist comrades. Instead, he is left alone, staring into darkness.",

            "content": "Films that double as if they are art on a canvas are some of the richest and most beautiful things that can come out of cinema, Il Conformista or The Conformist in English is exactly that. It not only has a very good story but in general looks stunning, the film is known for its camera angles but also its use of colour and the general production design that also catches the eye. From Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci comes this excellent piece and it is essential for any budding director or cinematographer that they witness the skill level put into this. The film is basically all about Fascism and shows a man sent on a mission to take out a former professor of his who is too anti-fascist for the regime of Italy in the 1930's. The film sounds much like a spy thriller and although in ways he is a spy, this is not all about exciting action, no this is dramatic and thrilling but does not require shootouts to entertain, it uses artistry, a solid script and characters who could be studied for many an hour.\n\nMarcello Clerici is the main person in this movie and is just as Fascist as your next Fascist, this man is willing to give things up to carry out the mission set out for him and important things that come his way in life do not stand a chance against his belief in normality and Fascism. The most intriguing character is for me not Clerici but the professor's wife Anna who is shrouded in mystery, we never truly know much about her but the way she is used in the story is fascinating. It uses many different people to get the story across whether within his friend, his Fascist overseer of sorts or his soon to be wife Giulia and that is really what makes this complex.\n\nIt is impossible not to talk about the way this movie looks after you have seen it with Bertolucci and cinematographer Vittorio Storaro creating something truly remarkable and although this could easily be called pointless angles, they actually do convey emotion or set the tone of the scene that is at hand. This film could be also get called pretentious but really it is not, many a film can use artistic elements in a way which is begging for awards but this feels different though. It actually tells a story alongside the beauty on the technical side of things and Bertolucci makes full use of that to create an interesting but also good looking piece of cinema.\n\nAs for the actors well it is of course Jean-Louis Trintignant as Clerici who is fantastic among all involved but do not take anything away from other cast. Stefania Sandrelli as Giulia is good and although at first can feel annoying starts to grow on you as the movie progresses and becomes a well worked character. I particularly liked the character of Manganiello played by Gastone Moschin who as the overseer I mentioned is just a great character and one that usually turns up in some major scenes of the film.\n\nSo The Conformist, adapted from the 1951 novel of the same name and given an artistically wonderful showing on the big screen, having never read the novel at the time of viewing I cannot say whether it is a true adaption but it does not matter to me if a book is made a little differently on the big screen. Bertolucci nailed this one and this could be said to be his best ever work, what stops it from being perfect is maybe some parts of the beginning and it can have a slow pace at a few places but nevertheless this movie is excellent and one that is just a fine piece, finely done.",

He wants to be normal, fit in, and while the film does a fairly solid job of showing us that performing an assassination might not be the most \"normal\" of things, it completely fails to show us how abnormal this view of normality is. \n\nOur man, played by Jean-Louis Trintignant, does a solid job with what he's given, but what he is given isn't really enough. You would think a guy who wants to conform would be a grade A pushover, but he isn't, not to the extent one would believe. It's implied his character was molested as a child and that this is part of the reason he's such a conformer, but those two dots are never really satisfactorily connected.

            "content": "Bertolucci is another wunderkind in the industry, at the age of 30, his fourth feature film, THE CONFORMIST has been proved to be a timeless classic, which I feel privileged to watch it now for the very first time.\n\nTilting camera angle, impeccable shots paralleling the moving train and zooming in from the external side of the window, sensual hues, cubistic buildings, punctilious light and shade deployment (Professor Quadri, the hunchbacked man being introduced by his silhouette), fluid ballroom dancing sequences, the bleak and cold-hearted manslaughter in a wintry woodland, all emerge as consecutive surprises and gustos along its non-linear narrative.  \n\nMarcello (Trintignant), a newly-recruited fascist member in Rome, is assigned for an assassination of his old professor Quadri (Tarascio), who dwells in Paris now with her young wife Anna (Sanda), the film hops back and forth episodically in recounting the newly-wed Marcello's matrimony life with Giulia (Sandrelli), a petit bourgeois trophy wife; their honeymoon to Paris with a clandestine aim to carry out the task until Marcello compellingly falls for Anna; meanwhile Bertolucci allocates episodes to sort out Marcello's personal lives, his attachment with his amicable blind friend Italo (Quaglio), his drug-addicted mother (Milly) and lunatic father (Addobbati); but underneath his placid and gentile veneer, lies an unfading quandary, stems from his encounter with a pedophile (Cl\u00e9menti) in his childhood and his latent homosexuality which pulses him to a perpetual and professed seeking of normalcy. \n\nTrintignant is exceedingly under-appreciated in his sophisticated and self-constrained portrayal of a man put in contradiction with almost anything around him, perfectly tallies with the political message of the film, a stooge, put-upon in order to rectify his own weakness, indiscriminately clutches any straw to obey conformability, while in the end, a sense of loss and disparagement is his own bitter fruit. Sanda and Sandrelli are stunning in their own distinctive beauties, the former is resolute, swinging both ways and emanating the like-a-moth-to-a-flame fatalism; the latter imbues a more traditional feminine allure with little clue about what's in her husband's mind. \n\nAlso it is noteworthy to give credit to Georges Delerue, who produced a spellbound score underlining the varying tenors of Marcello's state of mind. THE CONFORMIST is a pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistancer with its idiosyncratic aesthetic charisma to crown Bertolucci as the most important auteur in Italian cinema after his illustrious progenitors!",

            "content": "Bernardo Bertolucci's true masterpiece. A flawed and complex Fascist's life is told in multi-layered flashbacks. Instead of criticizing Fascism directly, Bertolucci aims at exploring the distortion and destruction of childhood trauma, homosexuality, dysfunctional family relationship, false religion and the disillusioned ideological manipulation of human mind. Jean-Louis Trintignant played this complex character masterfully, although he just needs to exemplify a creature without emotion, empathy and orientation. But he also presents the internal conflict between cowardice and suppressed 'abnormal' emotions in an endearing manner to emphasize that many are indeed leading a soulless life like Marcello did - only unconsciously without self-realization. Just link the character of Marcello to the emotionless Michael Corleone in The Godfather: Part II will you realize Bertolucci's legacy and significance. Excellent score by Georges Delerue.",
