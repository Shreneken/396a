            "content": "In the moody and introspective tradition of \"The Asphalt Jungle,\" Jean Pierre Melville demonstrates his mastery of the heist genre, reeling us in a bit at a time with a story that is stylish, taciturn, and laden with attitude. In a fashion that is perfectly suited to the noir aesthetic, Melville heightens the dramatic action of his film through the skillful use of silence and intense focus, crafting a riveting experience that involves us in every step of the process. We grow enmeshed in a story that is all the more engaging for its sly intelligence and bold willingness to counterbalance the precision mechanics of the heist with a deeper contemplation of inherent criminality. While afflicted by one or two notably farfetched developments, \"Le Cercle Rouge\" is nonetheless a taut thriller that will surely leave the viewer hungry for more.",

The trench coats, the cigarettes, the jazz, c'est typique; the 40 minute silent robbery, quite something else. A Buddhist inspired, American western tribute piece set in a very masculine France. There are many essays on what it means: chance, fate, life - a little impenetrable but an essential watch.",

            "content": "Stylish as few heist films could ever hope to feel.\n\nDirector Jean-Pierre Melville's French neo-noir crime drama Le Cercle Rouge (1970) remains a standout classic among French cinema. Melville's Le Samourai and Army of Shadows were magnificent practice for how doomed his atmosphere feels for Le Cercle Rouge. His slow burn direction keeps you on edge like you're literally along for the ride with these shady characters. Le Cercle Rouge is all about who you can trust when committing crimes and how people can change for the worse over time. It's got chic style with long trench-coats and fedoras like the old film noirs, but with a 70's French aesthetic.\n\nMelville's direction has tons of effortless cool and crazy helicopter ultra wide shots. I love the intense finale heist and all the smaller encounters with criminals along the way. Cinematographer Henri Decaë uses slick panning wide shots to allow us to see into dark rooms and on rooftops at night. I love the select close-ups for all the little nuances of these tough guys. Editors Jean-Pierre Melville and Marie-Sophie Dubus' sharp cuts between shots and scenes are timed to the music with strict cues. There's neat storytelling in between every moment that lets you know what's happening without ever needing to be told verbally.\n\nMelville's writing feels detailed to the point of being meticulous, enigmatic heroes that are all crooks except for a lone inspector, and hopeless in tone. You always feel a dreadful sense that something will go wrong as there's too many variables and enemies surrounding the trio of robbers. I guess crime doesn't pay after all. The inspector is constantly being told that people never change and will end up immoral by the end of their life. He gets to see possibly decent men otherwise turn to a life of crime. It's 140 minutes of charming characters and depressing results on hopeful scores.\n\nComposer Éric Demarsan wrote a playful jazz score that's moody for the darker passages and fun during the nightclub visits. Sound designer Jean Nény uses the ambient silence of night and little noises in the vault to really unnerve you. There's often disquieting noises in the background for realism and an eerie atmosphere.\n\nAlain Delon (Le Samourai) is captivating as French master thief Corey, fresh out of prison. His calm and measured cat burglar is refined and clever in every way. Bourvil as the crafty and persistent Inspector Mattei. He's often funny and charming in a pleasant old man type of demeanor. Gian Maria Volonté (A Fistful of Dollars & For a Few Dollars More) is ruthless and aggressive as escaped convict Vogel. His paranoia and caution is a nice foil and pairing for Delon's quiet and more subtle Corey. Yves Montand's ex-cop sniper is really touching.\n\nIn short, I loved Le Cercle Rouge. It's one of the greatest crime dramas ever made.",

            "content": "[Exterior. Paris. Grey, grey, grey.]\n\nAlain Delon, Gian-Maria Volonté and Yves Montand play an unlikely trio- one was just released from jail, the second fled it, and the third is an ex-cop. The three plan a big coup by breaking into a big jewelry store at Place Vendome, and are being chased by a grim inspector and rivals from the underworld. Le Cercle Rouge by the french Nouvelle Vague pioneer and Film Noir master Jean-Pierre Melville is a big, gloomy ganster film about friendship and loyalty, about guilt and betrayal. Centered around this precisely planned break-in, and with a famous heist-scene that is 30 minutes long and without any dialogue, it is the masterpiece in the championship of the neo-noir crime film.\n\nIt is not unusual that 10 minutes will pass before we hear the first words of dialogue in a Melville film, often being already over 30 scenes into the story. His cinema is one of a grey cinematography that loves the blue monochrome night, when reality is at it's most poetic and self-knowledge most acute, faces sculptured by light and shadow, the modelage of time and silence. It is a cinema of few words, words replaced by gestures, close-ups of silent faces, and just the flicker of thoughts. These faces all tell the same melvillian story: they are all marked by fatality, and death is their destiny.\n\nSiddhartha Gautama: the Buddha, drew a circle with a piece of red chalk and said: \"When men, even unknowingly, are to meet one day, whatever may befall each, whatever the diverging paths, on the said day, they will inevitably come together in the red circle.\" (Epigraph to Le Cercle Rouge)\n\nIn Le Cercle Rouge, like in most of Melville's films, his protagonists cannot escape their fates- they all die, being shot from behind, cold and trist, and the film ends. They are noble on their way to death, not rearing up anxiously like deadly injured animals, but facing it calmly and composed. Gestures and habits become the unchanged rituals of survival: lighting a cigarette, dressing stylishly, adjusting the hat, putting on gloves and driving the car. The life of a ganster consists of ceremonial acts, and the melvillian gangster rises above ordinary people by dying in dignity.\n\nMelville casted actors like Alain Delon and Yves Montand on their credibility in the loneliness, betrayal, violence, and male friendship of solidary silence. His is an entirely male cinema, and his protagonists move on a path of self-destruction or self-sacrifice, it is a melancholy realm of beautiful characters dispossessed by fate. And it is this what distinguishes Melville's films from just being crime movies, because they culminate in fundamental feelings and universal emotions. Thus, in addition to the solid structure and crime-plot of his stories, Melville always strived to show the torments of men exposed to their fate.\n\nMelville's morality is surprising and demanding: there can only be an absolute sincerity, though it often manifests itself in unlikely ways and tortuous paths. Having been a resistance-fighter in his youth, Melville's life and work stays true to the Resistànce. Nobody in his universe seems to know that the war is over, and they do not waste one thought on laying their arms down. Their war is never over. A solidarity connects the typical protagonists of his cinema, especially the bad boys, the scapegraces, the hard-boiled guys of the underworld, and the fighters of La Resitànce. A solidarity due to their code of honor, their existence in the underground, the precision of their practices and their knowledge. But also due to their relation to commitment and betrayal, their ability to endure pain and kill each other in the name of morality and silence.\n\nAlain Delon gave his best performances in his three films with Melville, with his talents and features being perfecty led and distilled within this unique actor-director symbiose. Unforgotten is his extremely focused and chilling performance as ice-cold and detached killer in ‘Le Samourai' (read my review here), the most acknowledged film in Melville's h'oeuvre. With no visible feelings and thoughts, but just delivering the lonely routine of a killer- yet with a streak of vertigo hinting at a personality disorder making him perceive the world from behind a somnambul veil- Delon was devoted to Melville after playing ‘Le Samourai'. His performance in Le Cercle Rouge is even better though, without the vertigo-effect even more minimalistic and austere in the sense of american ‘underacting', being an almost abstract figure within the narrative construction, but with his typical unmoved and anonymous compassion.\n\nLe Cercle Rouge also has an excellent jazz-crime score composed by Eric Demarsan, who collaborated with the great Francois de Roubaix (Le Samourai) before. It underlines the cool chic and fatalism with modern jazz sounds and the typical European 60s & 70s melancholy in its themes. Melville used film music in the most sophisticated sense, to deliberately sculpture the silence that dominates his films, to form feelings and thoughts with sound when they just flicker on screen.\n\nJean-Pierre Melville's passionate admiration of the American cinema of the 30's and 40's is the fundament for his cinematic determination, but he took it further and perfectionized it. It's beautiful to see the French-American circle close with contemporary directors such as Quentin Tarantino and Jim Jarmusch referring to Melville as one of their major influences.\nIt is a cinema fallen out of time, slow-paced, chic, in absence of modern chaos and cacaphony, but do yourself a favor to discover it and shed a tear over what we have lost, and the unavoidable fatality of everything.\n\nhttps://vinylwriters.com/le-cercle-rouge-the-red-circle-1970/",

            "content": "i wanted to like this movie. i really did. but in the end, it just didn't hold up to other good, similar genre movies of the same time period. I had a major problem with the decisions of the characters in the film. Also the movie is not tight enough. Overall the storyline is weak. it just didn't have that hook, that special intangible aspect to make it a cool movie. It was just sort of bland and the acting was just decent in my opinion except for yves montand of course. \n\nA main  problem  of mine was how vogel and corey met in the first place. That whole scene was just too much to be coincidental. I didn't buy it at all. In fact I thought the entire thing had been arranged beforehand somehow, which would have made a way better plot line. But to tell me that vogel is running, checks the trunks of all the cars and just happens to find corey's open is too much. And then corey, a man just released from prison, goes right along with it without skipping a beat. \n\nThis movie is just a long, slow, weaker version of Rififi. What is most bothersome is that instead of the crooks being cool and crafty, they are lame and blundering. No wonder the movie starts out with them captured or in jail-- I'm not surprised (and they ended up dead-- duh, saw that coming)! \n\nOther ridiculous things: \n\"Hey I just got out of jail-- how about I buy a car with dirty money from a rival criminal?!\" \n\"Hey, let's recruit the new gang member at a known hangout for gangsters!\" \n\"Hey, we can poorly tie up the guard right next to the alarm button!\" \n\"Hey, let's leave the rope ladder with our fingerprints all over it hanging from the roof of the jewelry shop!\" \n\"Hey, let's steal millions in jewelry and have ONE possible buyer for it all!\" \nI could go on and on... (continuing with the fact that the tip of this \"easy heist\" came from a POLICE GUARD!). \n\nYves Montand actually is the onlycharacter that's interesting with any sort of depth in this entire movie. And at least he's not stupid enough to die by getting SHOT IN THE BACK while RUNNING AWAY! \n\nLe Cercle Rouge is an interesting film to have seen, but i have no intention in rewatching it. It's way to dry to be entertaining or interesting. Melville's other work Le Samourai, is one of my favorite movies of all time though",

What's so great about this film's particular brand of cool is it's a non-showy, quiet cool that is pulled off with utter confidence by Melville. A quirky cast of characters gets together to pull off a major heist: a recently released criminal, an escaped convict, and an alcoholic former policeman. Fate conspires to place them all together and to face off against an unorthodox detective. I enjoyed the film very much but the 25 minute heist scene, which is almost completely silent, really elevated the film. Masterfully achieved, I can see how that scene alone inspired a number of heist movies to come after It's too bad, then, that the final shootout is a little hokey and on-the-nose. Still, the ending does not ruin the movie so much as end it with a whimper, rather than a bang.",

I couldn't believe it was filmed in 1970 as the setting feels 1950's.  \n\nMy issues with French cinema is the general overall lack of concern for story line, plot or character development.  Yves Montand's alcoholism and borderline insanity is introduced and never explored and quickly explained away.  Alain Delon's mob backstory drops in and out of the picture.  We never know why Gian-Maria Volonte's character is on the run.  The police work is sloppy and lazy.  The continuity of the story is equally sloppy and lazy:  it's clear weather, then it snows, then it's raining all during one day in the story.  \n\nThe plot twist of the police inspector/fence is overhyped in the description.  It's a red herring in the description as it is merely a set-up in the last 10 minutes to trap our criminals.  \n\nPlausibility and continuity is an afterthought.  One of the characters attempts suicide by ingesting two vials of Aspirin.  Riiiight.

In Le Cercle Rouge, a 1970s classic, Alain plays Corey, someone who served time in prison but isn't exactly seeking redemption at the end of it. He has a jewelry store in mind, diamonds and necklaces in several impregnable vaults in the store protected with laser rays, CC-TVs and security guards. \nFate brings Corey, Vogel and Mattei together, who team up for this final heist which is shot in dead pan silence, in the final twenty minutes of the film. Vogel is a man on the run after he jumps locks and an astute police officer in a train. Mattei is a retired, pissed off cop.\nThese men speak very little, smoke a lot, wear their fedoras and have very noisy pistols. There is some unsaid code of honor these men seem to guard, in spite of the several long takes of silences they seem to perform to. Maybe this is what the French New Wave actually represented. Suave, mysterious, hard boiled and brooding criminals who generally kept to themselves even in front of their women and died in the end making us wish we knew more about them. \n\nLe Cercle Rouge is a thriller which makes us worry about its characters as they meticulously plan and execute the daring robbery at the end of the film. This is, remember, without knowing much about any of them. One of them might even cut your throat when he meets you next. We never know but we still love and adore them. Is this reason enough to call Le Cercle Rouge, a good film, in spite of its snail's pace? \nCritics, I am told, call this 'deliberate pacing'. \n\nRating : 3/5",

There were 2 such scenes that comprised a large portion of the film: the man-hunt of an escaped prisoner and a heist scene.  \r\n     One of the few details that kept it from being a perfect film, in my opinion, is that could have developed the characters more. Because of those two extended scenes, the rest of the movie is limited into how much development can be incorporated. The director chose to split the remaining time between the criminal activity and the policeman in charge of capturing the escaped criminal. To be a perfect film in my estimation would have given the movie a greater running time to include both worlds, the criminal and police investigation. Another possible option would have reduced the screen time of the police investigation to focus on the criminal element more in depth.  But I can also appreciate what the director tried to do by having the contrast between the police investigation and criminal activity. It is nevertheless a great fun neo-noir heist movie.",

            "content": "Le Cercle Rouge is a step up from Jean-Pierre Melvilleâ(TM)s previous crime film, Le Samourai (1967). Make no mistake, the latter film stands impressively on its own, but compared to Le Cercle Rouge, Le Samourai simply cannot compete. Specifically because the plot is more complex and the characters are better developed. \n\nAlain Delon, the French version of James Dean, stars in both films by Melville. In Le Samourai, Delon is a hired hitman who religiously adheres to the hitman philosophy: finish the assignment even if it means sacrificing your own life. The story follows a traditional linear convention from Delonâ(TM)s point of view. Everything unfolds in the present, without any additional narrative tools such as, a flashback. More or less, the story development is very simple. \n\nOn the other hand, Le Cercle Rouge is a bit more complicated than the 1967 film. Though the film also unravels by following a linear narrative, the story mixes in three different points-of-views: Delonâ(TM)s character (Corey, a jewel thief), a blond and blue eyed detective (Mattei), and an ex-cop gone corrupt (Jansen).\nThe film relies heavily on chance encounters and their fates intertwine by a mutual contact: Matteiâ(TM)s escaped prisoner, Vogel. What is so interesting about Vogelâ(TM)s character is that he fills the role as the catalyst. If it werenâ(TM)t for his escape, Corey, Mattei, and Jansen would have never met and in theory Corey and Jansen would still be alive.\n\nIn addition to the filmâ(TM)s rich storyline, the story develops each characterâ(TM)s background meticulously. Outside of their given societal identities: cop or thief, Mattei for example has no other identity. The film makes an extra effort to show his solitary life at home. For instance, when he comes home, neither a wife or children greet him at the door, but instead three cats serve as his primary companions. As for Corey, on the day of his release from prison, the film quickly alludes to his past. As he checks out, the guards hand him his possessions: a watch, passport (expired), wallet, and three 3x5 photoâ(TM)s of a beautiful blonde woman. He shifts through the pictures pausing after each one as if to remind himself that his past identity is dead. It is presumed that the woman in the picture has not visited him once since his incarceration. This is supported by his reluctance to take the pictures with him. With no one to nurture him back to society, Corey quickly finds himself re-adopting to his thief identity. \n\nFrom the opening sequence, the film lets the action dictate the pace of the story. One of the most memorable sequences in the film is a twenty-six minute, no dialogue scene where Corey and Vogel break into a highly secured jewelry store. From the minute they enter the building they communicate solely through gestures. As a result, every move is given extra details. For example when Corey and Vogelâ(TM)s third accomplice, Jansen arrives a few minutes early to the scene, he kills time by doing an unnecessary and precautionary act by removing his black dress shoes (my guess is because he does not want to make extra noise). \nPurposely the film uses sparse dialogue to give the characters a certain impression. Since the story is about professional criminals, they let their actions do their talking.\n\nSteven Spielberg was once asked in an interview, What makes a good movie? He answered with, If you can follow a story without the sound and the movie still makes sense, that makes a good movie. I believe Le Cercle Rouge is one of those movies. It remains true to what a movie is by definition: a visual story.",

One of the great heist films, and perhaps, in its effort to portray seemingly random connections in a meaningful way, anticipates a more modern sense of synchronicity or interconnectedness. It seems as though the main interpretation is fate, however the coincidental connections that arise suggest a pattern. Is it a pattern the characters themselves are privy to? Not at all, which makes the viewer perspective somewhat privileged. We see a pattern they don't. Who is observing the observers? Is it fate or something more than random connection?

Well, this other movie of his was available to watch. So I did. And I wasn't incredibly impressed until the last part. \n\nThis movie was very visually appealing in the early go with these odd staged shots on top of methodic and meticulous situations, both action and conversation, that give you something to look at and ponder. But I think this really sacrifices the storytelling. It isn't until the odd high and dry hallucinations (was this an inspiration for Trainspotting?) happen, then this movie moves into something fun. I love the heist in just that it makes it look both simple because of planning, and thrilling since there was so much that could still go wrong. But much like a Jarmusch movie, I sometimes think scenes were just there for the art factor and not to propel the story. But I didn't necessarily think of these scenes as symbolic art artful. I didn't need to see the guy feed his cats.\n\nBut, I can agree that for film whores like me, this is a good watch. I think I may like the Samurai better, but this ended well enough for me to not dismiss others. Or dismiss it to you.",

The same day Corey is released Vogel escapes from the police superintendent Mattei, soon Corey and Vogelâ(TM)s paths cross and the decided to help each other plan Coreyâ(TM)s heist, all the while they have Mattei on the heels as well as Rico and his goons around every corner. \r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the movie thereâ(TM)s a quote from Siddhartha Gautama, the Buddha who after drawing a red circle said: âWhen men, even unknowingly are to meet one day, whatever may befall each, whatever their diverging paths, on the said day, they will inevitably come together in the red circleâ?\r\n\r\nNow obviously the men inside the red circle are Corey and Vogel and the people the surround themselves with including Mattei and Rico. But what is the red circle then? The heist, the place where Corey and Vogel first meet, the club where important facts are made and decided ect. All these places are part of the red circle and it itâ(TM)s here all the menâ(TM)s relationships are established and also where their ultimate fates will be sealed. I think the title and the plot of the whole movie by this definition is very philosophical and that in itself makes Le Cercle Rouge a very special and interesting heist movie thatâ(TM)s more than just your average crime flick.\r\n\r\nAs a heist flick Jean Pierre Melville takes his time showing us in a very intense and more than 30 minutes long sequence how the heist is pulled off, and about half that time is shown them just getting into the building.  This is where most heist movies today fail so badly and where Melville succeeds so greatly. A heist should not be over quickly, they shouldnâ(TM)t be pure or even pulled off perfectly. The heist in Le Cercle Rouge is pulled off to perfection in the end, but during the timeframe that it lasts the tension is high and Melville puts in plenty of moments where things indeed can go and almost does go wrong and it gives the viewer a change to think of all the things in the plan that might go wrong, also we donâ(TM)t know their plan before hand, which gives us the elements of surprise and curiosity. \r\n\r\nThe relationships between all the men in this movie is beautifully described and all wonderfully played by the actors. Itâ(TM)s a fantastic and awe inspiring movie that everyone should see and love.",

That being said, Le Cercle Rouge is nor (and film in general) at its finest. Melville's direction is tight and awe-inspiring, the cinematography is beautiful, and Alain Delon (as well as the other actors) is truly magnificent. Delon and Melville have the kind of noir magic probably only witnessed before between Bogart and Huston. Le Cercle Rouge begins oddly for noir film with a Buddhist story about people being fated to meet within the red circle. From the opening shots of the film, Melville's characters are driven towards their ultimate fate at the film's end and the film is indeed epic in scope. Ultimately, Melville's film explores the argument that all men are guily, an argument put forward by the police chief. And, in the final analysis, all people in this film are guilty of one crime or another. Asidfe from its exploration of tha amorality of the human race, Melville's film is also enjoyable on a purely surface level: billiard halls, executions, escaped convicts, hallucinagenically depicted bouts of delerium tremens, intricatly planned heists, etc. all compose a film that is as aesthetically pleasing as it is pure bad ass and cool.",

Et puis subitement, le film perd l'intensitÃ© qu'il Ã©tait parvenu Ã  mettre malgrÃ© l'absence totale d'action. La prÃ©paration et surtout le hold-up en lui-mÃªme sont interminables. La lenteur de la mise en scÃ¨ne (pourtant chose que j'apprÃ©cie gÃ©nÃ©ralement) n'arrange rien les choses. Melville montre, montre, montre et on finit par s'endormir. Le cinÃ©aste franÃ§ais m'avait pourtant habituÃ© Ã  mieux. Et puis, la grande force de Melville, c'est sa direction d'acteurs. Sauf qu'avec Delon, Ã§a ne passe vraiment pas. Il manque chez moi quelque chose dans cet acteur, une sorte de personnage que l'on voit mais un peu sans Ã¢me, sans profondeur alors que Belmondo et ou Ventura (pour Le doulos et l'ArmÃ©e des ombres) ont cette grandeur dans leur jeu. De ce cÃ´tÃ©, l'oeuvre est sauvÃ©e par Bourvil et Montand. Volonte n'Ã©tant pas mal du tout non plus. Mais ce destin des personnages est d'emblÃ©e fermÃ©, Melville n'apporte aucun Ã©chappatoire Ã  leur situation. Trop considÃ©rÃ©s comme des pantins Ã  mon sens. D'autant que la longueur n'arrange vraiment rien (2h20, c'est trop). Bref, sentiment trÃ¨s mitigÃ© sur cette oeuvre.",

Le Cercle Rouge has a bigger scope than those films, playing with both sides of the law as well as multiple protagonists, but it's all done with the same effortless sense of style and \"cool\" than made those films so memorable. Melville's not limited to his own films for inspiration, though; there's a long heist sequence here whose tension, silence, and limited dialogue can't help but remind the viewer of Rififi, and it's to the film's credit that the comparison doesn't hurt Le Cercle Rouge at all. The plot involves two criminals - one recently released from prison, the other recently escaped - who find their lives intertwined with a dedicated police captain and a sharpshooter battling his own alcoholic demons. But, as with a lot of Melville, the plot is solid, but beside the point; what makes Le Cercle Rouge so amazing is the mood and style of it all, the way it touches on something deeper all while seeming to be a pure crime film. An absolute masterpiece and well worth watching for anyone who loves films made in this particular variety of noir.",

De tous les cinéastes français que je connaisse, c'est probablement lui qui a le style le plus \"américain\". Ses films sont souvent un peu plus avares de dialogues que le film français typique, en plus d'aborder des thématiques habituellement associées au film noir à l'américaine. Les deux inspirations majeures de Melville pour le \"Cercle Rouge\" sont d'ailleurs \"The Asphalt Jungle\" de John Huston et \"Du rififi chez les hommes\" de Jules Dassin, deux classiques du genre, par deux Américains.\n\nTotalisant 140 bonnes minutes, \"Le Cercle Rouge\" ne se presse pas; tout comme dans \"Le Samouraï\", le rythme est assez lent, mais tout coule de manière incroyablement fluide. Dans l'univers de Melville, il y a peu de femmes, peu de souci d'expliquer les motivations des personnages, peu de chichi et de blabla. Ce qui importe, c'est l'honneur entre hommes de métier, entre hommes froids, calculateurs, qui vont droit au but et qui ne font pas de sentiment. En ce sens, aucun personnage n'est réellement attachant, mais le film fonctionne très bien comme ça. \n\nLe cinéma de Melville, c'est l'épitomé du cool. Tous les personnages sont relaxes, personne ne perd jamais son calme, personne ne s'emporte, tout est exécuté avec style et finesse. Ça me semble particulièrement vrai dans \"Le Cercle Rouge\", où Alain Delon et son incroyable moustache ne frémissent jamais d'un poil. Même la photographie, les couleurs superbes, les bleus sombres, les verts foncés, tout ça contribue à l'ambiance excessivement \"cool\" du film.

He's like the french new wave Sergio Leone, reinventing the crime film and noir through the european filter the same way Leone reinvented the western. You can clearly see why his movies influenced the work of John Woo and Quentin Tarantino. Although not as terrific as Le Samourai, Le Cercle Rouge is still pretty damn good. Like in Le Samourai, Melville's choice to silently observe every single gesture of the characters as they put their plans into action, without ever explaining beforehand what it is exactly that they're doing or even what's their plan to begin with creates a delicious feeling of curiosity. It's like the anti-Hitchcock form of creating suspense, where the audience is kept in the dark just until every single piece falls into place and suddenly everything makes sense. It's brilliant. It all leads to a pretty downbeat and anti-climatic conclusion that feels like nothing more than the inevitable fate these characters are bound to encounter. It's the weight of destiny, which seems to be a recurrent theme on Melville's work. Although I love the movie as it is, I can't help but think that it could benefit from a little trimming and a slightly quicker pace. It's a pretty slow movie, and some portions of it seem unnecessarily long. It's a great 2 hours and 15 minutes film. It could be a 1 hour and 50 minutes masterpiece.\n\nOh, and Alain Delon sporting a moustache is priceless.",

That being said, Le Cercle Rouge is nor (and film in general) at its finest.  Melville's direction is tight and awe-inspiring, the cinematography is beautiful, and Alain Delon (as well as the other actors) is truly magnificent.  Delon and Melville have the kind of noir magic probably only witnessed before between Bogart and Huston.  Le Cercle Rouge begins oddly for noir film with a Buddhist story about people being fated to meet within the red circle.  From the opening shots of the film, Melville's characters are driven towards their ultimate fate at the film's end and the film is indeed epic in scope.  Ultimately, Melville's film explores the argument that all men are guily, an argument put forward by the police chief.  And, in the final analysis, all people in this film are guilty of one crime or another.  Asidfe from its exploration of tha amorality of the human race, Melville's film is also enjoyable on a purely surface level: billiard halls, executions, escaped convicts, hallucinagenically depicted bouts of delerium tremens, intricatly planned heists, etc.  all compose a film that is as aesthetically pleasing as it is pure bad ass and cool.",

            "content": "After the washed-out, nearly monochrome despair of \"Army of Shadows\", the time was right for another journey into the criminal underworld, on another one of Melville's invented chunks of Eastern wisdom. The enhanced vividness of the color palette is evidenced from the very first frames, with a marble Buddha rotating against a pitch black background. To (poorly) paraphrase: \"All men destined to meet in life shall do so in The Red Circle\". As the text disappears, a bright red ovoid form is sketched in its place, like a bloody gash against the black void. \n\nColor is more prevalent, more necessary, than in any other Melville film. For the first time, he allows the luxurious saturation of Technicolor enhance the storytelling itself. Even if the palette and framing weren't top-notch, the langorous, quintissentially European crime epic would still be quite engaging on a surface level. \n\nThe three main characters are introduced as deftly as possible. Our central plot-catalyst (I hasten to use the term \"protagonist\"), is Alain Delon from \"Le Samourai\", playing mustachioed master thief Corey. As he plots his next scheme on the sneak with a confidant while still locked up in a prison cell, we cut to a police inspector escorting psycho Gian Maria Volente aboard a train. While still swathed in Police-issue blue sheets (the blue color motif repeats over and over), he spends a great deal of time picking the handcuffs he's sharing with the flatfoot. The tension is dragged out beyond all reason and then some, only to explode in unexpected (not necessarily violent) ways. \n\nA chase through the woods brings forth the green color scheme for the criminal element. The moss standing out like radioactive waste, grassy fields stretching endlessly into the horizon. Wide angle shots reduce Volente's life-or-death struggle to nothing more than tripping clumsily about some rough terrain. Later, cops will swarm like ants onto a similar field, blue dots creating a perfect lateral line, robotically scanning down the green void in unison. It's a perfect visual metaphor for cops scouring the underworld, methodically sweeping in their predictable way. \n\nA heist unfolds in a jewelry store like a high-tech version of \"Rififi\". A sharpshooter is needed, who happens to be an alcoholic ex-cop, introduced detoxing in his apartment. As Corey calls from a taxiphone, the poor sap is hallucinating various reptiles crawling about his trashed apartment, struggling to walk 10 feet to his phone and shuddering every agonizing step of the way. But once the deal's done, he's out on the streets in a sharp suit and fedora. A new persona, the clothes literally making the man. Who needs AA when you can obsessively train with a rifle to the point where you can shoot a homemade bullet into a lock from 20 yards without using a tripod? \n\nFans of Melville should know exactly what to expect here. Lots of American cars clogging narrow French country lanes, lots of ironies and ambiguities relating to the shared world inhabited by these two mortal co-dependent enemies. Cops and criminals are compared to black ants and red ants, cats and dogs, lions and tigers. The cool detachment allows us to be surprised by the actions of both sides, especially when laws end up having to be broken by the lawmen. What could be more Eastern than the tragedy of the pure spirit being punished for staying true to his code? It goes without saying that truism applies to both sides of this eternal struggle. (And by saying that, I just committed an intentional fallacy. ) \n\nWhat is The Red Circle? A bullet hole? An intangible, all-encompassing strand of Fate? A Dante-esque Circle of Hell? It can be all these and more! But in \"Le Cercle Rouge\" there are no roles for dames, which is a shame but a revealing flaw in an otherwise immaculate, existential sausage fest.",

Another one that came highly recommended was Jean-Pierre Melville's [i]Le Cercle Rouge[/i].

But that is the great style to [i]Le Cercle Rouge[/i]. It does things one wouldn't expect a film such as this to do. And the one notable thing is how everyone acts in the film. At first I thought everyone was sort of in auto-pilot in the film, but I began to realize that these people were so calm and cool throughout the whole film they didn't need moments to burst out loud.\n\nThe three thieves in the film were really great characters. Corey (Alain Delon); fresh out of jail, Vogel (Gian Maria Volonte); recently broke free during a prison transfer and Jansen (Yves Montand); a former cop with a few drug problems. None of these men really know each other, but the three come together perfectly to execute a risky jewel heist. I thought that the three actors did a fantastic job in the film, and were wonderful to watch.\n\nI also liked that [i]Le Cercle Rouge[/i] flipped the roles of the heroes and villains. The three thieves should be the bad guys, but we find ourselves hating the police characters in the film more. None more than Commissioner Mattei (Andre Bourvil). He was as corrupt as it got, and it was amazing to see the lengths this man would go to in order to get the three thieves into custody. A great performance by Bourvil, and one of the best movie villains ever.\n\nThe movie is hard to follow at times, and the slow pace does lead to some moments where you will be checking the clock. But overall this is a very well made movie, with an amazingly tense heist scene and a excellent finale. A lot of people have called this film the definition of cool, and I can see why that is.[/size][/font]\n[/left]\n[/center]",

            "content": "The first time I started watching [B]Skinwalkers[/B], I couldn't finish it. I got freaked out because it was late at night and everyone had fallen asleep, leaving me alone with my werewolf fear. However, the next time around, still alone, but this time during the day, it wasn't nearly as effective. The plot revolves around a group of werewolves who see the condition as a curse and a young boy who has been prophesied to save them. The there's the other group of werewolves who kind of like hunting and killing people and they're trying to stop this little boy. The story is good, the werewolves are effective and it has good production. But I think that's part of the problem. The movie is hit by a cool curse. It think's it a lot cooler than it is. Still, alone at night, this could creep you out.\r\n\r\n[B]Rififi[/B] is a truly awesome heist film. Jean Servais (\"Porzi\"), just out of jail, burns the screen with his eyes. The perpetrators execute the heist in complete silence. It's gritty, sometimes funny and then heartbreaking. I loved it. I don't even have the words for how good this is.\r\n\r\n[B]Le Cercle Rouge[/B] is another tight heist film, and a definite influence on at least two Coen Brothers films. Again, the heist is pulled off in silence. This film is on a grander scale than Rififi and show the cop as he tracks the criminals. It features a guy busting out of a moving train window, but that awesomeness is shatter by the ludicrous dance number put on by the women at the night club. Still, definitely worth watching.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to Rififi and Le Cercle Rouge, [B]The Italian Job[/B] is a joke. Michael Caine (\"The Dark Knight\") plays a fast-talking thief just out of jail who orchestrates an elaborate heist, with lots of talking, and complete with mini cars. I lost interest in this, and there was a terrible song that got stuck in my head for the rest of the day. Plus, a groan-inducing ending. I preferred the remake. And that's sad.\r\n\r\n[B]Kiss of the Spider Woman[/B] won William Hurt (\"The Incredible Hulk\") an Oscar for his portrayal of a gay prisoner sharing a cell with Raul Julia (\"Street Fighter\"). To pass the time, Hurt tells Julia the plot of his favorite movie. And they bond. And it really is as boring as it sounds. I guess in 1985, playing a gay character was a bigger deal than it is now, because I thought Hurt did a good job, but not necessarily an Oscar-worthy one. I just kept wondering why they were allowed open flames in their cell and thinking how Hurt looked a lot like Glenn Close when he was wearing makeup.",

In fact, in this film, Melville seems to spend as much time detailing the cop's position as he does (as is his wont) the crook's. Everyone, on both sides, is tough and cool -- they don't blink, they just get on with it, even when shit happens. Red circles appear now and again, but the film is primarily blue and gold.

            "content": "Jean-Pierre Melville has disappointed me every time thus far (Army of Shadows and Le Doulos), so I don't know why I expected the critically-acclaimed Le Cercle Rouge to be any better than his other critically-acclaimed films. Like Army of Shadows, it's all gray and brown and dreary blue, as if the studio forced him to shoot color against his will (Le Doulos, in black and white, looks a lot snappier). Also like Army of Shadows, it's a bit too long, and extremely quiet. But while keeping actors quiet works for some directors (if we're comparing talk-free French jewel heists, Dassin does it best in Rififi), Melville's edits lack the visual dynamism necessary to keep an audience engaged through the actors' silence. In his slow, drab sequences, there is little to cling to, which leads me to Gian Maria VolontÃ¨'s performance as escaped convict Vogel, for he is the only one to draw us in.\r\n\r\nWhen the film opens, Vogel is cuffed to the upper berth in a train, supervised by police inspector Mattei (AndrÃ© Bourvil) in the bottom bunk. Vogel makes a rather stunning break by picking the lock of his cuffs and then kicking out the train window, leaping through the broken glass while the train is in full motion. He runs madly through the woods, and we never suspect that he'll make it past Mattei's immediately instigated dragnet, but he throws the dogs off his scent by crossing a river, and when he gets out onto the road, he hides in the trunk of a car parked at a restaurant. It's only mere luck that the car he picked belongs to Corey (the icy, ultra-French Alain Delon), a convict himself, released from prison that morning, at which time he robbed an old enemy at gunpoint and then purchased said vehicle with some of the money. Corey sees Vogel getting into his trunk (where he happens to have left some guns), and he drives out into a deserted, muddy field to confront the man. He shows Vogel his release papers from prison, and they share a smoke. Luck gets them through the dragnet, and they drive onto Paris, to Corey's old apartment. Here, Corey lets Vogel in on a job he's planning: a jewel heist.\r\n\r\nThe shop they are planning to hit has just installed a new, electronic safe/alarm system (rather evolved next to the alarm system featured in Rififi, but one that the cast of Ocean's Eleven would sneeze at). To break in, they need an excellent marksman, and Vogel has a connection with a bad cop who's a great shot. Corey calls him on the phone to set up a meeting, and we see Jansen (Yves Montand) at home when the phone rings in the film's only, but very, psychedelic sequence; the man is in bed, sweating and shaking, staring at an opened secret door in the striped wallpaper, out of which lizards, snakes, and rats wriggle and thump across the floor, up onto his bed, and into his face. He seems to be suffering from Heroin withdrawal, and so, later, once he's shaven and showered, met with Corey, and agreed to do the job, when we see him back in his room, wearing a suit, measuring and weighing curious substances, and melting them in a crucible, we are surprised to see that he is molding his own bullet. This bullet will be of the precise combinations of metals that, from the combined heat of the gun and its impact with the alarm system's keyhole, it will melt into and release the lock, instantly leaving all of the jewel cases open for the thieves to plunder. The heist goes off without a hitch.\r\n\r\nAs in Rififi, it's the translation of the jewels into cash through the fence that creates the problem. The fence Corey originally chose backs out of the deal, and he's forced to go to nightclub proprietor Santi (FranÃ§ois PÃ©rier) for a connection to another fence. Meanwhile, Mattei has been putting pressure on Santi to help him find Vogel, for the business man has strong connections to the mob and all the Parisian crime scene. Santi continues to refuse until Mattei brings his teenaged son in on marijuana charges; he then yields, and when Corey comes to him for a connection with a fence, he provides Mattei, in an improbably disguise consisting of sunglasses and a pinky ring. Corey takes the bait, though, and drives the jewels out to the country estate Mattei has named, telling Vogel to stay at home. Vogel's sixth sense refuses, though, so he follows Corey out to the estate; the moment he walks in and sees Mattei, he tells Corey to grab the jewels and run. He runs too. Mattei, and the hundred-odd officers lying in wait run after; both thieves are shot down. Jansen, on the scene as well, and back on the side of the law, is accidentally shot dead by Mattei, thus proving his strange, misanthropic commissioner's preemptive accusation (at the film's beginning, when Mattei is called in for losing Vogel, the commissioner insists that all men are guilty).\r\n\r\nThis seems a tidy conclusion; all men are guilty, all men are dead, crime doesn't pay, etc. But there are a number of strange loose ends that remain unresolved. What exactly was going on in Jansen's apartment with all of those creatures? He cleans up too quickly to have had a real problem. And what is going on with Mattei at his apartment? Twice we see him come home to his three cats, going through his routine of removing his hat and coat, opening the taps of the bathtub, and placing a dish of food from the refrigerator onto the middle of the kitchen floor for the animals. The second time he comes home, the third cat is slow to appear, and ominous music plays while the camera zooms in on the food dish. We are certain the camera will swing around to reveal a murdered feline, but nothing comes of it. And finally, what of the strange tenderness between Corey and Vogel? In the final scene in Corey's apartment, before he leaves to meet Mattei, they share a moment weirdly tender, even lover-like, and after Corey leaves, Vogel makes his decision to follow while fingering a red rose (brought home by Corey from his initial meeting with Mattei at Santi's). Perhaps I'm overreading, or perhaps Melville was just sloppy; why would he plant these seeds and then leave them unattended?",

The film isa dark and cynical look at the nature of human beings, our interactions with each other, and the obsessions we carry with us. All of these themes are framed around a story about three men planning a heist and the detective that relentlessly persues them. All the main actors are simply brilliant though I am quite partial to Bourvil in the role of a detective, a man feeling pressure from every corner of his life but is still able to reveal depth and emotion in his quieter moments even if he is calculated and determined while on the job. Montand, Delon, and Volonte portray the three criminals and they all do superb work here, capturing the desperation, pain, and hope that each carries inside them. Above it all though is the direction Melville who makes certain scenes and sequences seem simply effortless. The bank heist scene is one of the best in film history and very few moments are as meticulous and well captured as the sequence. Melville, in all of his films, is attracted to and interested in what drives men to do the things they do and in this film, aided by a brilliant script and great acting, he achieves to show us.",
