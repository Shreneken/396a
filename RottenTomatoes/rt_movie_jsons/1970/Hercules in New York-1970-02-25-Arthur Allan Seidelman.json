Its chock full of bad acting and cliche things all around, but I must say I did find some form of fun from watching this. Schwarzenegger can't speak worth anything in fact he was dubbed over it was so bad. But seeing the original version is its own reward. Its just one of those dumb movies from the 70's. Its astounding that this is Schwarzenegger's first movie, but at the same time he blends right in. He's a mad hulking meat head, its hard to believe the actor inside would wind up to eventually play the Terminator. Watch this movie at your own risk, but if you're in the mood to see some dumb Schwarzenegger moments than this is the movie for you.",
