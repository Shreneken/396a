    "summary": "James Cameron's \"Titanic\" is an epic, action-packed romance set against the ill-fated maiden voyage of the R.M.S. Titanic; the pride and joy of the White Star Line and, at the time, the largest moving object ever built. She was the most luxurious liner of her era -- the \"ship of dreams\" -- which ultimately carried over 1,500 people to their death in the ice cold waters of the North Atlantic in the early hours of April 15, 1912.",

The epic romance between Jack and Rose, played by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, unfolds against the backdrop of the ill-fated voyage of the Titanic, creating a heart-wrenching story that will stay with you long after the credits roll.\n\nDirector James Cameron's attention to detail is evident in every frame of the film, from the stunning set design of the Titanic to the hauntingly beautiful score by James Horner. The film's impressive visual effects, which seamlessly blend CGI and practical effects, make you feel as if you're aboard the doomed ship yourself.\n\nBut what really makes Titanic a five-star film is the incredible performances by DiCaprio and Winslet. Their chemistry is palpable, and their characters' journey from strangers to lovers is both believable and heartwarming. The film's supporting cast, including Billy Zane and Kathy Bates, also turn in strong performances that add depth to the story.\n\nOverall, Titanic is a cinematic triumph that has stood the test of time. Its emotional impact, unforgettable characters, and stunning visuals make it a must-see film for any movie lover.",

            "content": "Titanic was a commercial juggernaut that earned over $2.2 billion at the worldwide box office, holding the record for the highest-grossing film for over a decade. James Cameron became known as one of Hollywood's most successful and influential directors as a result of the movie's enormous box office success. Additionally, Titanic left a mark on popular culture and the movie business. Its popularity rekindled interest in epic romance themes and helped establish the significance of special effects and digital technologies in contemporary filmmaking. \n\nSet against the scene of the Titanic cruise liner crashing into an iceberg in 1912, which served as the film's backdrop. The film depicts the heartwarming tale of Jack, a struggling painter, and Ruth, an aristocratic woman, who fall in love and set aside their preconceived notions of the outside world. Ultimately, Jack gives up his chance of survival for Ruth. \n\nIn the past, I was unable to comprehend Jack; I always assumed that he was a romantic lad with liberal ideas who enjoyed leading an unrestrained life. The maxim \"To make each day count\" appealed to me because I desired adventure and independence. There is no purpose in focusing only on love because life is harsh and not a haven for those looking for pleasure. Thinking back on the entire movie, Jack's words and deeds eventually made it clear to me that he is the one who knows the most about love and life. He was the one who taught Rose how to love and live her life to the fullest. In addition to being Rose's lover, Jack Dawson served as her spiritual supporter. He cared for her until she was grey and helped her recall when she was unable to walk anymore: \"There was a man named Jack Dawson, and he saved me in every way that a person can be saved.\" \n\nThe phrase \"I trust you\" appears frequently throughout the movie, but it is more than simply a phrase; Rose repeatedly descends to the sea-soaked bottom to save Jack, each time vowing to perish. She makes little sense, doesn't give it any thought, and simply shows that she can be trusted by acting accordingly. The tragedy is a wonderful addendum to love, and the ideal interpretation of love warms everyone's hearts from the inside out rather than making them freeze like the Ocean. \n\nTitanic's cinematography is exceptional in terms of visual and acoustic effects, utilizing cutting-edge digital technology and special effects to give the audience a realistic sense of being on board the ship. A true epic classic is the scene where Jack and Ruth \"fly\" over the ship's bow. This sequence was shot partially in a studio and partially using special effects. While the actors' sequences were recorded on green cloth and later composited in post-production, the stunning crimson sunset in the sky was shot on location. In addition, the editing and cinematography are first-rate, and they do a fantastic job of bringing the plot to life. For instance, the design and scenes of the cruise ship were captured using the one shot to the end method. The starting and ending frames of the camera accurately plan and manage the so-called one shot until the end, producing a seamless visual effect. \n\nTitanic is an amazing movie that demonstrates the bravery and resiliency of people as well as the fragility and emotional strength of the human condition. It is a timeless film that, in addition to being visually spectacular, provokes serious reflection on moral principles and the meaning of life.",

With outstanding performances from the entire cast and great chemistry between DiCaprio and Winslet, it's easy to get lost in the melodrama but never enough to forget that the film's harrowing last hour is based on actual events. The believability comes naturally as the film's production design and costumes spared no detail to bring the director's vision to the big screen.

            "content": "Titanic is simply a masterpiece. This movie has it all. A tremendous score, deep emotion emphasized by fantastic performances, and incredibly gripping and high-stakes action. There is really something for everyone here.\n\nBefore I continue my praise of the film, I think it has one glaring weakness: the present-day plot. For me, this just did not work all that well. I understand that it was implemented for the main story to have a more emotional impact, but it was not needed. It added almost thirty minutes to the runtime, which could have been used for more character development in the story or to have a more streamlined plot. Not to mention, the acting in this section was lackluster. That might be a hot take, but it was something that I noticed during my watch.\n\nBack to the positives. The score is magnificent here. The minute I finished the film, I had an urge to put on this score to be transported back to the Titanic. That does not happen very often to me.\n\nThe performances are great all around. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet's chemistry was perfect. They played off each other so well and really sold this emphatic and rapid love the two shared. The movie spends a lot of time building their relationship and the payoff at the end is worth every second. Billy Zane was an over-the-top asshole, and even though it was cheesy at times, it worked for me. The other ancillary cast members did well, including Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher and Bill Paxton.\n\nThis film is really two movies put into one and both of them work excellently. The first half is a charming and cute love story that spends a lot of time on character development, laying the background for motivations and personalities. While this half may have been my favorite, it is slightly outdone by the second half, which is a gripping and suspenseful survival action story. This section is brutal, showing large scale panic and hysteria while also having some incredibly horrific deaths. The chaos was infectious and very scary to watch. Both halves create a great sense of emotion in the audience and complement each other very well.\n\nOverall, this movie had twenty-five years of hype and critical acclaim to live up to, and I am happy to say it passed expectations. Since leaving the theater, I cannot stop thinking about it.\n\nScore: 96%\nVerdict: Masterpiece\n\nOn a side note: I did see this movie in 3D during the twenty-five-anniversary re-release. While it was great to see it remastered in 4K, I do think the 3D was poor and unneeded. This did not affect my grade however, since it was not originally designed as a 3D experience, and they 3D did not really take away for my enjoyment.",

It's one of those movies that despite being over 3 hours long, you're sucked into the world and enthralled from start to finish. It's a must see for movie lovers, it brings tears to my eyes every time I watch it.\n\n25th Anniversary:\nI saw \"Titanic\" for the first time roughly ten or so years ago. As time has passed I have quickly discovered that this is one of those sweeping epics that I'll watch and love for the rest of my life. I knew that I had to experience this film on the big screen at least once and seeing it restored in 4K with the addition of the immersive 3D was nothing short of spectacular. The movie has a great romance at its core, despite some cheesiness, the chemistry, and feelings are genuine. The bulk of the movie is an exhilarating and devastating disaster movie that deserves the big screen treatment. Overall, I will always be a defender of this movie and think it was completely captivating for all 3+ hours, and seeing it in theaters is something I'll treasure forever.",

It's very obvious from the hateful ramblings of all the one star reviews that they are posting in bad faith because they decided to hate the successful  movie and will continue to hate it even if it was a good movie. Plus, many likely didn't even watch the entire movie and just gave it 1 star out of spite that a female led movie with a feminine perspective was very well received.

To begin with, \"Titanic\" is the 3rd highest grossing movie of all time. I know this because the lifetime gross of the movie is $2,201,647,264, making it the 3rd highest grossing movie. Highest grossing means that a movie earns more money than other movies, which means that out of all the movies that have been made, \"Titanic\" is the 3rd movie that has earned the most money. It has an amazing plot, filled with plot twists. Despite the movie being over 3 hours long, it never gets boring. The plot is filled with plot twists, for example when everyone thought that Rose wouldn't survive in the cold ocean, we then discover that she was one of the few survivors. It is also a beautiful romance movie that certainly has all of us hooked and emotional. It builds an agonizing climax before shifting towards a heartbreaking end. \"Titanic\" has an amazing soundtrack, including its most famous song, \"My Heart Will Go On.\" Besides having a great plot and being one of the biggest grossing movies of all time, \"Titanic\" also includes an incredible soundtrack. Its most famous track is \"My Heart Will Go On\" which was performed by Celine Dio. The song became so famous that it soared to No. 1 in the Billboard 100 chart.  It also brings comfort to millions of people and it accurately resembles Rose's character in the movie. Critics may argue that films like Romeo and Juliet or the Notebook are superior to Titanic, but since Titanic is said to be based on a true story, this connection makes it the greatest romance film of all time.",

I'm not much of a fan of romance movies, so that isn't the aspect of Titanic that draws me to it- but I will say that Kate and Leo are so talented and have such natural chemistry that the \"love\" aspect never feels like a chore to get through. There are certainly some cheesy moments, but the movie leans into it in such a way that you find yourself getting swept up in it anyhow. It's truly the last hour that makes this movie shine. It's been over 20 years and the practical effects that went into the entirety of the ship sinking still hold up so incredibly well.  It's triumphant and heartbreaking, and brilliant to behold. A stand out is certainly the \"Nearer My God to Thee\" scene, and I think very few movies have come close this one in terms of showing human nature at its mostt raw- fear, sorrow, love and hope.",

As one example, First Officer William McMaster Murdoch is shown in his final moments murdering two passengers before turning the gun on himself like a coward. That wasn't very nice of you, Jim. I don't get the argument of it being a creative liberty, there's creative liberties and then there's THAT. Also, there's a huge issue with setting a fictional story in the middle of a real event. If you're gonna make up half the details and the main plot, why not make up the ship, too? Paul Gallico did the same thing for The Poseidon Adventure, and it worked wonders. However, I feel the reason as to why they called the boat and the movie \"Titanic\" was to sell tickets. Everyone and their cat knows about the unsinkable Titanic. Hell, it wouldn't be the last time something like this happened, just take a look at Todd Philips' Taxi Driver remake.",

Although it is known for the romance and the two famous stars on the movie posters, Titanic has a historical background that is also very interesting to be observed and taken into consideration. Rose was being forced to marry someone she hated to save her family from economical disgrace, Jack was treated with despise when he was among the wealthy people on the ship, and, in the end, the poor people (many of whom were people of color too) were left to die while the boats were being filled with the aristocrats. I've watched this movie dozens of times but I always manage to get very teary. In my opinion, both of the protagonists are charismatic (specially Jack, my beloved), and I love their scene on the ship's bow because the soundtrack and the photography are great. Of course I would be way happier now if jack had not died, but we can't have everything so I accepted his fate. I don't think the movie is completely perfect because you can always find things that are susceptible to criticism (it is still white-centered, for example). However, I still recommend this movie even though it is really old and everyone might have already heard about it, but for those who haven't: that's a unique experience you are missing out on.",

The film looks sumptuous, with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects, and the direction from James Cameron rarely slips from focus. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances as Jack, and Kate Winslet is lovely as Rose. David Warner, a great actor, steals every scene he's in. The story is very rich in detail, and is hot on character development, obvious with the love story which is very moving when it needs to be, though in the first bit of the movie it is a little slow. The last hour is extremely riveting, and I will confess that I was on the edge of my seat, when the Titanic sank. I will also say that the last five minutes were very moving. The music score by James Horner was lovely, though I never was a huge fan of the song My Heart will Go On. The 1996 miniseries was good, but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies. Overall, I give Titanic an 8.5/10. Bethany Cox.",

            "content": "Summary:\n    In 1912, a huge and fancy cruise, the Titanic, was voyaging from England to New York. It was a cruise that carried people's dream of new life in America. There is also a romantic story that happened on the cruise. There are two main characters in the movie, Jack and Rose. Jack was born in a poor family. He won the Titanic's tickets from a bar. He was full of dreams and was excited about having a new life in America. Rose was born into a wealthy family. However, her family went broke a few years ago. Her mom wanted to maintain a wealthy life, she wanted Rose to marry a rich guy who Rose doesn't love. Rose was reluctant to get married to him and she decided to jump off the boat to kill herself. However, Jack walked by and saved her. At first, Rose wasn't happy about Jack saving her life. For Rose, a life of pretending to be rich seemed superficial to her. She almost felt suffocated in life like this. Jack's appearance was a beam from the sun to her foggy heart. Jack showed to Rose that even the people who lived in the third class were not rich, but they owned the real happiness. Meanwhile, Jack and Rose got to have more chances to stay with each other, and they fell in love. While they were dreaming for their future in America, they didn't know that the danger was getting closer to them.\n\nAnalysis:\n    Titanic is a movie with romance and history. It is adapted from a real story. All the story starts from Rose's memory in the Titanic. By recalling the scene, it brings the audience back to 1920. Through highly restored scenes from the Titanic, the audiences can experience the life on the Titanic. I think Titanic was popular at that time for three reasons: fancy special effects, the romantic story, and that it was based on a real story. Wallace Hartley was a real violinist who played with his band their last song on the Titanic and in their lives. That is the most unforgettable scene for me: while the boat was sinking, the violinists started to play \u2018Nearer, My God, to Thee' on the cabin. They didn't rush to try to get a spot from the rescue boat, instead they chose to play this music to calm down people. Here are two different aspects of why they chose to play this song. Firstly, the song can bring people peace. Secondly, the song mentions the coming death, and it acted like a funeral song because most of the people would die because of lack of rescue boats. Through playing this song, people can realize that death is not the end and God is always watching over his people, and they would be able to meet God and their beloved one. Eventually, the violinists sacrificed their lives for playing music to the people. Titanic is not just a movie but also a society, it shows people from different social statuses experiencing that disaster together. There are heroes and villains. The violinists are heroes. Their music brought the Spirit and peace to the boat, and they even all sacrificed themselves in the end.  \n\nCritic/Recommendation:\n    I think Titanic is an awesome movie, not only because of its reality but also based on what they wanted to share with the audiences. Titanic is a romantic movie with a disastrous ending. In addition, I think the director is good at mixing every element in the movie. As I mentioned before, the Titanic is not just a cruise, it also represents a society. Through people's words and actions, I can learn from history and experience the love between Jack and Rose. The special effects were a hit at that time. When the movie came out, special effects were not as common as now, also most people have never been into that background of the early 20th century. The movie lets them have the chance to experience life at that time which can make the audience more involved in the movie while watching it. Even after twenty-two years have passed its special effects are still a legend. Due to its perfect story and fantastic special effects, I rate it 5/5 stars. I highly recommend people go watch the movie.",

In addition, like so many Hollywood epics, it tends to drag on much longer than it needs to.  On the love side, there's nothing else quite like it. It's a well-executed and thoroughly engaging exploration of the struggle between the classes and the idea of enduring, eternal love that will draw the viewer into the drama regardless of whether the audience wants to be drawn in or not.",

To a captive audience, she tells the story of her younger days (Kate Winslet) when she fell in love with a young man named Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio).  She comes from money, and he is a poor artist.  How can they make it work when she is already engaged and traveling on a ship that will have the most infamous capsizing of all time?  With Titanic, I feel like there are two distinct camps of people.  There's not a lot of middle ground, and it seems like you either love it or hate it.  Here I am reviewing a movie that came out almost 25 years ago, can you guess which party has my membership?  For me, this is just blockbuster filmmaking at its finest.  It's no secret that this was a passion project for the water-obsessed James Cameron, and it is plain to see how inspired he was when he made this.  He created a world that I love to get lost in, which is a major strength of almost his entire library.  I feel like the majority of Titanic haters enjoy ragging on the fictional romance they added to the real-life tragedy, but I have always found it to be highly compelling.  This is Kate and Leo at the very start of their illustrious careers, and they both knock it out of the park.  The chemistry they share is real, and you always understand how they can end up falling for each other, despite the impracticality of them being together as a couple.  As if the demise of this ocean liner wasn't enough of an obstacle for their relationship to overcome, there is also the true villain in the fianc\u00e9, played here by Billy Zane.  For me, he is one of the most entertaining antagonists ever created.  He is always slippery, slimy, and privilege personified, and every single line of dialogue he has somehow manages to make each situation worse.  Some of the CGI has not aged terrifically.  Specifically, I'm talking about the wide sweeping daytime shots of the ship towards the beginning, but those moments are fleeting and ultimately don't taint the rest of the film.  Everything else looks spectacular, and many scenes leave me asking how they filmed it to this very day.  They never forget the proportions, and you always recognize the sheer size of this vessel, even though most modern cruise ships now dwarf the Titanic.  The filmmaking is so tight that every time I watch this, I feel like this might just be the time that the ship will miss the iceberg.  I am forever captivated with my heart in my throat whenever I find the three hours to watch this, and the small details with secondary and non-characters will forever be imprinted in my brain.  Titanic is one of my very favorites with good reason.",

Not one person survived with a Third Class ticket. The rich negotiate, offer leverage, hide in spacious lifeboats and Rose survives instead of Jack. This is an accurate story but should be received as a tragedy instead of a romance. What lines of memorable dialogue are there? They pass the plot along, the ship must sink.

Is it one of the best movies of all time? Not quite. Is it a really well-done film that stays in our minds years and years after seeing it for the first time and if it is playing on a TV channel, you put it on? Why, yes. I understand the bother with a \"pointless\" love story plot line for dramatization but what's funny is that it works with the strong performances and magical chemistry between DiCaprio and Winslet.

Towards more the last section of the film where the boat officially sunk down, there is a shot from sky above of all the passengers screaming and flapping around the water. Up close, it is suffocating hysteria and from afar, it is just one sound in the middle of the gigantic ocean. People being left to die (as there are themes being shown of the lower class being purposely cast aside and the rich prioritized) and people coming to terms this might be their last breath on earth. Playing with camera angles intensifies a small scene for a viewer and makes that small scene stand out in a 3 hour movie.",

            "content": "Shmaltzy, overly long, ridiculously well crafted and disarmingly heartfelt this movie is just larger than life. I think it's pacing problems are best summed up by the very first scene where Bill Paxton's character essentially does the same gag twice with the exact same reaction from his crewmember. Everything that is done in the present day in this film is essentially useless and definitely provides the most unnecessary though not the only element that makes this movie as grandiose as it is. I was ok with it all, but it made the film seem redundant in a lot of places. Do the present-day scenes add to the film? Yes, but only incidentally, it does put us in the frame of mind of the impending tragedy in a very delicate way and makes for a very meaningful and lovely ending scene but all of that was accomplishable in much less time-consuming ways. After all, the love story is the heart of the film, it would have been perfectly acceptable to keep it to just that. What happens on the Titanic is what really sets this movie apart. At it's core this is a romance and that's what gives the wide appeal of the film but in general terms, this is an absolute masterclass (and I can't stress that enough) in disaster film. I got the feeling that that was what drew James Cameron to the Titanic as a potential film, the slow sinking of such a lavish set piece, the impending and ever nearing doom as the water chases after our heroes as they struggle to survive. It is in the disaster elements (and in the glorious shots of the Titanic before that) that the film is entirely justified in it's longevity. The scale of such a disaster demands a film of such scale and Cameron was certainly the filmmaker, perhaps the only filmmaker, who was truly up to the challenge of giving the Titanic justice. So in terms of destruction, this movie absolutely floored me not even mentioning the staggeringly large scale and lavish set design. The scenes in the engine room particularly gave off a visceral sense of largeness and power that was awesome to behold even on my computer screen and the shots of the Titanic's propellers rearing from the water literally took my breath away. Its like this movie's sets are beefy. That's the word that came to me while watching it, I don't know why but that's what I thought. Of course, no amount of excellent cinematography, special effects, set design, music or sound editing will make a complete film and since we all know the story, a genuine personal touch was necessary for this movie to really excel. Well, I won't call it genuine per se but I will call it just as larger than life than the ship it took place on. I don't think it's a secret to anyone just how melodramatic this movie's nuclear romance between poor artist Jack and unsatisfied rich girl Rose is. I suppose it's also clich\u00e9 to a point but I didn't really mind (it helped soften the cliches when James Horner's score just leans into the schmaltz with full force) I think the film does a good enough job with building up it's emotional center and it sprinkles in enough universally pitiable scenarios (the musicians, the babies, the families) to make it personally devastating as the long, slow burn of the Titanic's destruction unfolds in all of it's glory. The story didn't really hold any long-lasting meaning, but I don't mind that either, it was just a story aiming to be a crowd pleaser and a white knuckler at the same time, and it succeeded really well at both. I liked the whole \"jump together\" motif. Somehow, I didn't see its payoff coming and old Rose throwing the heart of the ocean into the sea really spoke some volumes about something\u2026 I don't know, it was emotionally resonant at the time. Came for the destruction, stayed with the romance long enough to actually get to the destruction and enjoyed the sweet, admittedly pretentious ending.",

The underlying Romeo and Juliet love story of the film's two central characters, Jack and Rose, is engaging and bought to life by the perfectly cast Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet, who have just enough chemistry to make you care about their love story. A fantastic supporting cast of quality actors, perfectly cast, helps to bring this modern remake of A Night To Remember to life. You realise you have completely bought into the movie when you feel utter dread during the sinking scenes.\nDefinitely one of the all-time greatest movies ever made. A true masterpiece.",

Despite its bizarre length of over 3 hours, I was consistently entertained and rarely bored as well as inspired by the incredible acting performances, eespecially DiCaprio and Winslet, a beautiful love story between Jack and Rose that's filled with excellent chemistry and so many great scenes like where they first meet, the score is simply incredible and it does such a great job of displaying the Titanic. The set is magnificent and the contrast between rich and poor as well as society expectation and free will is handled really well but the moment the ship hits the iceberg, it's near perfect. You truly feel the tension and fright as we see the effect of the sinking on so many people as well as the (let's be honest) terrible organization of the crew and the visuals hage aged super well. Hard to believe it's a 1997 movie. And gosh that last half made me cry, seeing the hopelessness of many of the victims and of course, Jack's death. I'm still pissed that Jack died but that bastard Cal survived. But still, incredible. It's definitely slow at times. You really feel that 3 hour runtime and I think less time could have been spent on the fictional (but well developed) love story and more on the Titanic itslef and seeing the different people om board.

It is still just the third highest grossing film ever (however part of that comes from the 3-D rerelease) and still is quoted and talked about constantly to this day. Now is it a perfect movie, no. Is it overrated, absolutely. But there is still such a great nature to it that makes it honestly hard not to love (at least slightly). The first 90 minutes of the movie is essentially just a chick flick (and the writing is not the best) but it has such a charm to it and Leo and Kate\u2019s chemistry is so likable that you can\u2019t help but enjoy it (even if it isn\u2019t the best). Then the rest becomes a completely different movie almost, as we see the titanic sink. This is where the movie really becomes phenomenal. The effects done and the cinematography and shots we get are great. Even though I\u2019ve never really liked James Cameron much as a person you deny that he is a great director, especially with action scenes like the end to the movie. The entire last half of this movie is completely thrilling to watch and also it is heartbreaking when (spoiler alert) Jack dies (but you probably already knew that). I love this film a lot and even though it has its problems I can\u2019t deny the power that this epic has.",

There had long been a definitive, historically accurate movie about the ship sinking and there had even been one where a love story is told while the ship sank as a backdrop. The good news is that this knowledge didn't really sully my experience at all; they did a FAR greater job here at capturing the sense of wonder that the ship provided its passengers, the love story was more compelling, they took the right creative liberties by creating high-quality antagonists and they did a better job creating a sense of foreboding with the sinking alluded to throughout the runtime. The main thing I disliked was the way they framed the narrative as nearly all of it felt clumsy, from the Old Rose narration sounding like she was reading off a piece of paper to the treasure hunting guy having conflicting attributes with his clearly-expensive effort to dig up artifacts trumped by knowledge he would've had beforehand, that some ship passengers loved each other. The movie would fall a bit short from a purely technical standpoint but it's still one of the greatest viewing experiences ever provided by film as a medium, so I'm giving it the full score here. Woohoo!",

The plot seems to be very absorbing because it's a real romance story who makes you cry ! There are amazing special effects who transmit different emotions. The photography is really incredible and absolutely breathtaking for a movie dating of 1997. Leonardo DiCaprio is an amazing actor and knows how to convey emotions. The script of the movie is realistic and thought provoking because the movie is inspired by a true story. There are music in a background who is very touching in different scenes.

            "content": "Titanic - 10/10. It baffles me that people bash on this film just because it became a cultural zeitgeist. Titanic was everywhere and anywhere. People who've never seen movies went to watch it and owned it on VHS/DVD/Blu Ray. People who were cinephiles would go watch it in theaters almost monthly. History on the Titanic got a huge boom of interest and museums began to invest more and teach more on what happened on that fateful day. The movie won 11 Academy Awards, tying the record. It became the biggest box office hit for a while, and the first billion dollar movie. It ran in theaters worldwide for nearly a whole calendar year. And all this, was thanks to the genius and perseverance of a dedicated filmmaker, James Cameron. When the usually R rated content director wanted to make a sweeping PG-13 epic that was gonna be half a romance film and half a disaster film, many looked at him different. But Titanic became a cultural film because it connected with people in many different ways. Not only was it about romance and the ship, but it was also about classism, sexism, ageism, greed, and the bright and dark shades of human nature in desperate times. Its such a deep blockbuster, and one that wasn't designed to have sequels. All of this is encapsulated within one film, and its so impressive that every time you revisit this film, it feels like you enter a journey and are transported to those times. Cameron's film is one of those movie you need to see to believe!",

Also helping it along is the wonderful Kate Winslet as Rose and Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack.  She and Leo DiCaprio have amazing chemistry together as the fictional couple from different worlds. The way that sci-fi and horror director Cameron turns the Titanic into a monster when it hits the iceberg is something to see - the last fifteen minutes of the sinking is awesome to watch.\n\nWhat doesn't work? With so many amazing real life stories of the passengers and crew of the famous ship, James Cameron decides not just to ignore them, but create a rather foolish and preposterous tale about a missing diamond and filling out the supporting cast with cliched, silent film type characters (the snooty mother, an odious fianc\u00e9, a greedy publicity hungry shipping magnate) which takes away from the natural power of the famous shipwreck. Billy Zane is particularly bad here in a Snidely Whiplash-esque turn here as Rose's fianc\u00e9 Cal Hockley, complete with an equally nefarious sidekick/right hand man played by David Warner. And Frances Fisher as Rose's mercenary mother Ruth, gives an icy, one-dimensional performance, like a scheming matriarch in a nighttime soap opera. Fisher is a much better actress than that. And Kathy Bates is criminally wasted as Molly Brown, who was probably the ballsiest passenger onboard. Her presence is muted here, but Bates works with what she's got. And the crew and second class passengers are pretty much ignored. We are left with the wealthy, entitled and elitist first class passengers and the naive, plucky and resourceful immigrants in third class. No one else counts. I also like Bill Paxton in his role as the fortune hunter Brock. \n\nBut the film is infectious fun despite its glaring flaws; it's impossible to not get caught up in the sheer spectacle, from the treasure hunters using cutting edge technology to inspect the Titanic's rusty bones, to the excitement of a glamorous ocean liner making its maiden voyage, to the tragically dramatic wreck. The film still manages to impress.",

They are awesome. I loved the effects. Still very convincing. However as per usual with James Cameron, I don't like that much of the story. The first half is very clich\u00e9. It's your standard romance that you've seen a million times. But it does it well. I had fun with the it. But it was very standard and the script wasn't very good. Throughout the whole film. It's not the worst, but it feels kinda 90s. But the second half is where the real indifference is. On the one hand, it looks great. Some of the things are pretty awesome. And while I hated the fact that I was horrified and had a ton of anxiety. But that was on intentional. But something about it felt wrong. If this wasn't real I wouldn't have felt as bad. But it felt a bit to dark and exploitive for my taste.",
