I knew that the story was about world war 2 so I wasn't very much excited to watch it at first, it is why I gave it an okay rating. It was usual world war 2 stuff at the beginning, was pretty boring, and didn't have anything interesting. But as the story continued, I started to pay more attention to it, and it actually was good halfway through, until it finished with a very excellent ending. Overall, an okay movie that I would have given it more if I was liking it from the beginning.",

            "content": "Saving Private Ryan is a cinematic masterpiece that immerses its audience in the brutal and visceral reality of World War II. Directed by Steven Spielberg, the film follows a group of soldiers as they search for a paratrooper, Private James Ryan (Matt Damon), who is the last surviving brother of four soldiers killed in action.\n\nFrom the opening scene, Spielberg's masterful direction pulls viewers into the chaos and horror of the D-Day invasion. The intense and realistic depiction of the beach landing is one of the most unforgettable moments in cinematic history. The sound design is outstanding, with the roar of gunfire, explosions, and the screams of wounded soldiers all adding to the sense of dread and danger.\n\nThe performances in Saving Private Ryan are nothing short of incredible. Tom Hanks delivers a nuanced and emotional portrayal of Captain John Miller, the leader of the search party. The rest of the cast, including Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore, and Barry Pepper, all deliver exceptional performances as well. But it's Matt Damon's portrayal of Private James Ryan that really stands out, with his haunting monologue at the film's climax leaving a lasting impact on the audience.\n\nWhat makes Saving Private Ryan such a remarkable film is its unflinching portrayal of war. The violence is brutal and unrelenting, and Spielberg doesn't shy away from showing the physical and emotional toll it takes on soldiers. Yet despite the horrors of war, the film also manages to find moments of beauty and humanity, reminding us of the sacrifices made by those who fought for our freedom.\n\nOverall, Saving Private Ryan is a cinematic tour de force that showcases Spielberg's mastery of the craft. The film is an emotional and unforgettable tribute to the brave soldiers who fought and died in World War II, and it remains a timeless classic that should be viewed by all.",

This film portrays the war much more realistically, which also means it's incredibly violent and disturbing, especially at the beginning. The characters feel real, as does the emotion. While not suitable for some, this movie can, while fictional, really help us understand some of the horrors of war, but also that we're all humans. Saving Private Ryan showed us that German doesn't always equal Nazi. That you shouldn't kill someone just because they're wearing the uniform. It taught us to see the human in others.",

The sheer grittiness and realism with which this film presents itself with a plot which is so emotionally driven it could literally make you want to stand up and salute your soldiers and a score so riveting that gives you absolute goosebumps every time you listen to it, you know you're going in for a cinematic masterpiece.\n\nfirst of all, this film, truly, in every sense is what depicts warfare in it's most real and raw form. the violence is so real and so hard-hitting, I literally had horrors while seeing it and had to pause a couple times during some scenes. Props to the director Steven Spielberg for pushing through all that criticism of graphic depiction and choosing to show us exactly how much a war actually destroys in both, the physical and the spiritual form.\n\nnow, the story is this film's strongest point. a heartfelt story like this set in the backdrop of the second world war just hits you right in the gut with a powerful punch and the emotional catharsis it provides to the characters (and the viewers too) at the end make it one of the greatest written endings I've seen.\n\nthe acting is yet another strong branch of the film without which I think this film would've totally tanked. Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore, Jeremy Davies, Barry Pepper all of them are so good, they make you believe that they're actual war veterans. hell! even vin diesel gives off a decent performance here! (that should definitely say something right?)\n\nif you want to experience what cinema was truly made for, watch this film. this is not just a war film filled with military propaganda but so much more.",

            "content": "\"Saving Private Ryan\" is a 1998 war/action movie directed by Steven Spielberg, and starring Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, and Tom Sizemore. The film follows a group of soldiers during the Normandy invasion of World War II, as they search for a paratrooper named Private James Ryan who is the last surviving brother of four soldiers.\n\nOne of the strongest elements of \"Saving Private Ryan\" is its depiction of the horrors of war. The film's opening sequence is a tour de force, showing the brutal and chaotic nature of the Normandy invasion with a visceral and unflinching approach. The rest of the film does not shy away from the physical and emotional toll that war takes on soldiers, and the acting by the ensemble cast is exceptional, especially Tom Hanks as Captain John Miller.\n\nThe film also features stunning cinematography by Janusz Kaminski, with a desaturated color palette that adds to the film's sense of gritty realism. The use of handheld cameras and quick cuts in the battle scenes also adds to the film's intensity and immediacy.\n\nSteven Spielberg's direction is masterful, skillfully balancing the action and emotion of the film, and creating a sense of tension and urgency throughout. The musical score by John Williams is also excellent, with haunting melodies that capture the film's somber tone.\n\nOne potential criticism of the film is its sentimentality. While the film is undoubtedly powerful and moving, some viewers may find the emotional moments to be manipulative or overly melodramatic.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Saving Private Ryan\" is a powerful and visceral war/action movie that is a testament to the sacrifices made by soldiers in World War II. Its exceptional acting, cinematography, and direction make it a classic of the genre, despite some potential criticism of its emotional manipulation. It is a must-watch for any fan of war movies.",

The movie isn't all bad as the first 30 minutes are very great and detailed showing how chaotic the front was. The characters are very intriguing when put in different scenarios but most of the time they are either sitting around or are in excruciatingly long battles that don't progress the film and makes it feel like you're just waiting for the end of each battle except the first one.

Edward Burns and Barry Pepper were my two faves in support but so many recognizable faces popped up in this eclectic cast, with no discernible weak spots.\n\nThe battle scenes that bookend this film are some of the most intensely captivating and engagingly authentic images of WWII I can recall seeing in a film. These scenes never feel like they are being given an artistic flourish, rightfully so, and are seemingly shot with a total lack of emotion or commentary on the part of the filmmaker, adding to the raw impact felt through many of them.\n\nI am not sure which film will now supplant this at the top of that aforementioned list but I'm pretty sure it won't live up to the hype as well as this did... 9.5/10",

ALL of the actors in this brilliant movie did and amazing job, but the one that stood up for me was Tom Hank's with such a good performance. The plot was a little bit stretched for me, but itself, the plot was great.\nanother thing I gotta praise is the director, other than THE Steven Spielberg. on the paper, the movie is five stars, but I think there were a lot of unnecessary scenes that just made the movie way longer then it should have been. I think that the movie would have been able to sum up in two hours and the extra fifty minutes of scenes just made it a little bit discouraging. But it's still one of the best war movies ever. If you like the genre or just want to see a quality movie, I would higely recommand on \"Saving Private Ryan\"",

            "content": "One of the most powerful film experiences I've ever had. Steven Spielberg's sobering, emotional, and patriotic WWII film redefined what a war film should be. No romanticizing, no heroics, no good guys or bad guys. What shines through is a kind of humanity rarely witnessed on film. The opening 24-minute D-Day invasion is the most astonishing, ambitious, and meticulously researched and detailed battle sequence ever committed to celluloid. Nothing has ever matched its scope and chaotic grisliness. It perfectly captures the randomness, harrowing devastation, and inhumanity of war. The film isn't just an absorbing story about a rescue mission, it's also a philisophical film about the pointlessness of war. Janus Kaminsky's Oscar-winning cinematography brings a documentary-real look to the events, with bleached-out film stock and gritty, nervy hand-held cameras recreating the look of old newsreel footage of WWII. The acting is superb across the board, with not a single bad performance to be found. Tom Hanks brings down his charisma to play an everyday man caught up in this bloody campaign, who must remain a stoic and strong leader for his men. It still baffles me how this lost the Best Picture Oscar to 'Shakespeare in Love.' Remember that film? No, not many people do. But this is a moving and honorable testament to those men who gave everything in that war, the lives they helped saved, and to Spielberg's legacy as one of the best filmmakers in history. This is the best war film I've ever seen, and one of the greatest American films ever made",

Tom Hanks is always fantastic and I think the moment you feel for him is in the moment where they are pinned down on the beach. The supporting cast helps in the first act really establish ground and with actors like Vin Diesel playing off Edward Burns and Jeremy Davies shines in the role. The moments where Hanks interacts with Davies are also great but help Adam Goldberg as well. Finally running into Matt Damon really delivers and helps bring it home with Hanks right on the bridge. Overall 9.5/10.",

I mean, in the stabbing scene, towards the end, my English teacher had to leave the room.

I'm talking, of course, about the Omaha beach landings, not the cold opening of a veteran visiting a grave (I don't want to give anything away there). It remains one of the most astonishing pieces of film making ever put to screen, and what is impressive about the film is that the key battle scenes throughout, shot in the mud and filth of desecrated rural France are every bit as focused. There is a very loose connection between the plot and a real life tale, and if there is a criticism of Saving Private Ryan it is perhaps its opening and closing. It adds an emotional heft that doesn't really need to be there in my opinion. But it's a small quibble, and Saving Private Ryan remains an incredible piece of film making, one that Spielberg backed up in the genre by going on to produce Band Of Brothers (2001) and The Pacific (2010).",

You won't be disappointed.  SPR has long been one of my favorite movies.  Without a doubt the best war movie ever made.  Much has been made about the opening 20 minutes of pure hell where Steve Spielberg subjects the viewer to the horrific experience of those landing on the beaches of Normandy in June 1944, and I would encourage those who are averse to blood or war to put on a brave face and steel yourself through the battle because you will come away with a far greater appreciation of the men who fought so hard to take back what Hitler stole from France and the world.  The high definition realism is terrifying but necessary to understand why the characters quickly become so hardened to their new reality.  The cast is first rate with surprise cameos from familiar names such as Ted Danson, Paul Giamatti, and a youngish Bryan Cranston, but the real awards go to the incredible Tom Hanks and several now familiar stars in their relatively unknown days including Barry Pepper, Vin Diesel, Jeremy Davies, and Edward Burns.  Spielberg hits all the right notes with outstanding battle choreography and effects, pacing that should keep everyone interested, and visual detail and cinematography which leaves you wondering how the beautiful prairies and hillsides of France could have existed so close to the ravages of small villages laid to waste.  I found myself caring for the characters survival as most are well developed and realistic as well as period dialogue as well written as it was read.  SPR isn't without a blunder or two, most notably a scene where the eponymous character played by Matt Damon uncharacteristically balls up and bawls out during the climatic battle, and the final scene was a bit too melodramatic and poorly acted for such an epic movie.  Yet, I remember in 1998 sitting in my theater seat for what seemed like hours (probably 3 or 4 minutes in reality) with a full audience in stunned silence well after the movie ended before finally filing out of what remained a very quiet room - the experience having affected us all.",

Firstly the directing, this has to be Spielberg's best directed film, mostly because of how realistic the film looks ( it was so realistic a veteran in WW11 was a extra quit because of how realistic it was, look it up), and how graphic it also is. The best part of the film has to be the first 30 minutes, it begins with the D-Day invasion in Normandy. Spielberg made a life-size invasion on a beach in Ireland with the troops landing on the beach and the Germans on the hills. What made it better was the film editing which is the best I have ever seen in a film. the sound design as well was terrific and intense. The production design is also very detailed and realistic with all the destroyed buildings and the ruins. the cinimitogerphy is also one of the main aspects of this film because the color was down graded to a duller color. The film is about Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) in the U.S army tasked with a mission to find a Private James Ryan in the 101ts (Matt Damon) somewhere in enemy France to inform him his 3 brothers they were KIA and to bring him home. In the film Miller takes a squad of 8 men to find Ryan. The mission was a succses with 6/8 dead. the film end with a wild and intense final battle (no spoilers). Over all this is one of the best, most original, and detailed films ever made. At the Oscars it won best director but it should have won best picture (winner Shakespear in love).this film is a 10/10.",

It was in my Top 10 was some time.\n\nThat D-Day scene, man did they capture those terror so perfectly. Hearing WWII vets crying over watching that sequence brought to life so realistically is the highest bar for real life-adaptation anyone can achieve.\n\nStill it is hard to believe that Day occured, so many soldiers dieing for the sake of others to reach the other part of the beach, those scenes lives up to the 'Normandy was impossible'\n\nEven after having the world's best war sequence the movie doesn't shy away from other small, yet thrilling action sequences. After that much action we go to the dialogues and they were so great, so much motivational dialogues were written.\n\nSaving Matt Damon, his character saying 'Why me' gave me goosebumps. The other cast were also great, after seeing more 90s stuffs (Friends)- a lot of familiar faces, feels like cameos now.\n\nAfter every battle there were casualties, every death scene was emotional, even in the small runtime those side characters were well written, each different.\n\nSpielberg didn't shy away from 'GoodVsBad', some translation from opposition (Czech) felt heartbreaking. Eye for an Eye theme was explored greatly.\n\nOne of Tom Hanks best performance, English language will run out of adjectives if I say how great he was.\n\nEven to this day, those practical effects holds up, the cinematography & hand held camera for DDay were glorious. Deserves all Oscars.\n\nUpham in that stair not able to help is fellow soldier for 'no kill rule' tears audiences up from inside everytime. Him not having clich\u00e9 hero(arc) moment had great consequences.\n\nIt has become a classic now, one of Hollywood's greatest movie.",

It revivifies the themes and the meaning of the film all over again and a perfect promotion for what upgrading the quality of films can do for them. This too happened with Apocalypse, Now: Final Cut. \n\nSaving Private Ryan is a film constructed to say so much with so little, the characters of the film follow the same rule, effortlessly watchable with no one painted with broad strokes and left, like comrades, with their depth and uniqueness just bubbling beneath the surface. The aural soundscape is second to none, overwhelmingly impressive and immersive. \n\nThere's nothing sadistic about this film and yet it is brutal and pulls no punches.

Every aspect of this film was created in an astonishing and realistic manner. The first war scene was very well constructed, combined with amazing action sequences with realistic war sequences. The film looked extremely realistic from start to finish. The action sequences were engaging and were also a graphic yet realistic depiction of war. The film also has amazing performances by Matt Damon, Tom Seizemore and Tom Hanks. The sound effects were amazing and really did make you feel as if you were in the battlefield. The camera work and cinematography was very well done. The different shots that were utilised were utilised effectively in order to capture the chaos of war. The practical effects in the film was very well done. The only thing I wish this film did was to put german translations when they would say something when in combat. Worth 100%.",

            "content": "An elderly veteran visits the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial with his family. At a tombstone, he falls to his knees with emotion. The scene then shifts to the morning of June 6, 1944, as American soldiers land on Omaha Beach as part of the Normandy Invasion. They suffer heavy losses in assaulting fortified German defensive positions. Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks) of the 2nd Ranger Battalion leads a breakout from the beach. Elsewhere on the beach, a dead soldier lies face-down in the bloody surf; his pack is stenciled Ryan, S. In Washington, D.C., at the U.S. War Department, General George Marshall learns that three of the four sons of the Ryan family were killed in action and that the fourth son, Private James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), is with the 101st Airborne Division somewhere in Normandy. After reading Abraham Lincoln's Bixby letter aloud, Marshall orders Ryan brought home. Three days after D-Day, Miller receives orders to find Ryan and bring him back. He chooses seven men from his company. Sergeant Mike Horvath (Tom Sizemore), Private Richard Reiben (Edward Burns), Private Adrian Caparzo (Vin Diesel), Private Stanley Mellish (Adam Goldberg), Private Daniel Jackson (Barry Pepper), Medic Irwin Wade (Giovanni Ribisi) and Corporal Timothy Upham (Jeremy Davies), an interpreter from headquarters...\n\nSaving Private Ryan received acclaim from critics and audiences; much of the praise went for Spielberg's directing, the realistic battle scenes, the actors' performances, John Williams' score, the cinematography, editing, and screenplay. Rotten Tomatoes  The consensus states \"Anchored by another winning performance from Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg's unflinchingly realistic war film virtually redefines the genre. Many critics associations, such as New York Film Critics Circle and Los Angeles Film Critics Association, chose Saving Private Ryan as Film of the Year. Roger Ebert gave it four stars out of four and called it \"a powerful experience\". Janet Maslin of The New York Times called it \"the finest war movie of our time\". Gene Siskel, Ebert's co-host and critic of Chicago Tribune, said that the film \"accomplishes something I had been taught was most difficult\u2014making an action-filled anti-war film or, at least, one that doesn't in some way glorify or lie about combat\". Writing for TIME, Richard Schickel said that was \"a war film that, entirely aware of its genre's conventions, transcends them as it transcends the simplistic moralities that inform its predecessors, to take the high, morally haunting ground\". Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised the film, saying that \"Spielberg has captured the hair-trigger instability of modern combat.\" Kenneth Turan of Los Angeles Times praised the film as well, calling it \"a powerful and impressive milestone in the realistic depiction of combat, Saving Private Ryan is as much an experience we live through as a film we watch on screen.\"\n\nMany World War II veterans stated that the film was the most realistic depiction of combat they had ever seen. The film was so realistic that some combat veterans of D-Day and Vietnam left theaters rather than finish watching the opening scene depicting the Normandy invasion. Their visits to posttraumatic stress disorder counselors rose in number after the film's release, and many counselors advised \"'more psychologically vulnerable'\" veterans to avoid watching it.\n\nReleased on July 24, 1998, Saving Private Ryan received acclaim from critics and audiences for its performances, particularly from Hanks, realism, cinematography, score, screenplay, and Spielberg's directing. It was also a box office success. At the 71st Academy Awards, the film was nominated for 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor for Hanks and Best Original Screenplay; it went on to win five for Spielberg's second win for Best Director, Best Film Editing, Best Cinematography, Best Sound, and Best Sound Effects Editing, though the film lost Best Picture to Shakespeare in Love in a controversial upset. The film also won both the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama and the Producers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture, while Spielberg won Golden Globe and Directors Guild of America Award for Best Director. Since its release, Saving Private Ryan has been considered as one of the greatest films ever made and has been lauded as influential on the war film genre. Steven Spielberg\u00b4s WWII epic drama is such an emotional and moving piece of film showing the horrors of war, the casualties, the survivors, the courage, the trauma, the sorrow and the comradery. It\u00b4s a fine piece of film that manages to move me to tears every time I see it.  And I think it\u00b4s important to show how horrifying war is and I also think that it\u00b4s good that we show our deepest gratitude for those who gave their lives in WWII to free Europe. Wonderful performances from all the actors (Tom Hanks is magnificent) in the leading roles and it is so well made particularly in the battle scenes and sequences. \"Saving Private Ryan\" is by far one of Spielberg\u00b4s best films and one of the best WWII war movies ever made in my opinion.",

            "content": "I wish that this idea had not been attached to Harvey Weinstein of all people but I do think it is true that this film does not manage to live up to it's first twenty minutes as a relatively dull story and a script packed with clich\u00e9s lets down a film with incredible direction and production design. I admire the film in it's execution of battle scenes and it managed to keep me engaged a lot longer than other war epics like The Longest Day (1962) and All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) but it still didn't grab me emotionally and when the film tried to be touching it felt overwrought. Still, it's definitely better than Shakespeare in Love (1998) and I would recommend that people watch it if only for the battle sequence in the opening scenes.\n\nThe plot of the film is relatively simple as after the Normandy Invasion seven men are ordered to find Private James Ryan, Matt Damon, and bring him back to America as his mother has lost her three other sons and General George Marshall pities her. The men are led by school teacher John H. Miller, Tom Hanks, whose hand has begun shaking as his power over his men lessens. Fiery Jewish soldier Stanley Mellish, Adam Goldberg, arrogant Southern sniper Daniel Jackson, Barry Pepper, dissenting New Yorker Richard Reiben, Edward Burns, aggressive ally to Miller, Mike Horvath, Tom Sizemore, and Adrian Caparzo, Vin Diesel, are joined by nervous polyglot Timothy Upham, Jeremy Davies, who has never experienced warfare before. Everybody knows the frustrating twist but it doesn't make it any less annoying when it eventually occurs.\n\nThe immediacy of the scenes of warfare is shocking as we feel that we are immediately inside the mind of one of the poor soldiers who had to take part in the Normandy landings. Spielberg manages to convey the chaos of war while also allowing us to follow various characters, primarily Miller, as they try their hardest to just survive. The scene also works because it is exciting and interesting to watch but it also gets across the horror of war and makes you absolutely terrified of ever having to be involved in a conflict like that. This is a unique achievement because many films that are supposedly about the horrors of war and how it negatively impacts people end up glorifying war and selling young men on the idea that war is a glorious experience. This scene is impressive and few directors could have directed the scene with as much efficiency and focus as Spielberg did.\n\nBeyond this scene however the film began to lose me as we see the traditional bonding scenes that occur in almost every war film between this very different group of men. The character introduction that Upham receives is almost slapstick and the film doesn't go much deeper than that in digging into his psyche as he serves as the comic relief until he has his moment of redemption at the end of the film. Of course Miller gets a big speech that is undoubtedly the reason that Hanks received an Academy Award nomination but it didn't have the panache of Kirk Douglas' speeches in Paths of Glory (1957). None of the individual character moments were particularly memorable and therefore I felt very little connection to the characters and the sight of various men getting shot was something I became desensitized to as I began to realize that in each battle scene we would lose at least one member of the team. This was not what the filmmakers wanted me to feel and I wish that I cared when Miller died but I didn't and as he tells Ryan to \"Earn it\" I was not as moved as I would have been in a film that's even slightly more original.\n\nThis is perhaps the second best film nominated for Best Picture in 1998, I like the much maligned today Life Is Beautiful (1997), and I think that it deserves recognition for the scenes of battle. If I am honest my dislike of war films might have affected my view of the film and if I loved this genre I might be more into it but as it stands I can't find it in myself to love it.",

The story goes as Tom Hank's character is tasked to find and save the only Ryan brother as all of his other brothers are K.I.A. and Hank's performance as a soldier in World War 2 is possibly the most realistic as it shows the horrors that troops saw during the assaults. Matt Damon as Ryan is also very good as he was relatively young which adds to how young soldiers were sent to hell to fight the Japs. The last scene really hit the heart for me and creates the best emotional resonance. The incredible special effects really show the true gritty reality of war. This film is not like previous classic war movies such as Where Eagles Dare and The Guns of Navarone where they somewhat glorify being in war. Saving Private Ryan is among the greatest of Spielberg. Today, there have been similar gritty movies of war such as Fury and Hacksaw Ridge but for me, this is better than those. Overall, I highly recommend seeing this obviously take into count the lengthy running time but it is well worth it.",

The 2nd scene, the 25+min war sequence of the landing at Omaha Beach may be the best war sequence ever put to film (even better than the amazing war sequences in Apocalypse Now).  Of note, is the direction, the acting, cinematography, editing, etc.  Tom Hanks as well as others did a magnificent and realistic (for all I know) portrayal of soldiers who had a mission that they didn't agree with.  It's amazing how all the actors aside from Damon did a 10 day boot camp together, leaving Damon to do his on his own because they wanted to keep the animosity between that the soldiers had re losing good men in order to just save Damon.  There are noted historical errors in the film, namely making it seem the Americans did everything on Omaha Beach by themselves when in fact everyone knows the British played a huge role in those events... but aside from these errors/omissions, the crew went out of their way to make it feel as real as possible, and that's commendable.  I'd recommend that everyone watch this movie at some point in their life.",

            "content": "Analyse Critique du Film Saving Private Ryan\n\tLe film Saving Private Ryan, sorti en 1998, raconte l'histoire d'une escouade de soldats qui ont la t\u00e2che de r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer un soldat pour le rapatrier. L'histoire se d\u00e9roule durant le d\u00e9barquement en Normandie et peu de temps apr\u00e8s. R\u00e9alis\u00e9 par Steven Spielberg, ce film est connu pour sa sc\u00e8ne du Jour-J et sa repr\u00e9sentation pr\u00e9cise de la perspective historique des soldats am\u00e9ricains de la Deuxi\u00e8me Guerre Mondiale. Cette repr\u00e9sentation a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e pour d\u00e9montrer que les soldats n'\u00e9taient que des gens ordinaires. \nLe message de cette oeuvre est que les soldats am\u00e9ricains n'\u00e9taient que des individus normaux qui menaient des vies ordinaires. Spielberg tente de transmettre ce message \u00e0 plusieurs reprises et de diff\u00e9rentes mani\u00e8res durant le film. Par exemple, le premier soldat Ryan parle de la vie \u00e0 la maison et de ce qu'il allait faire quand il allait y retourner. Ceci indique que les soldats ne pensaient qu'\u00e0 retourner chez eux et qu'ils pr\u00e9f\u00e9raient une vie normale plut\u00f4t que le champ de bataille. Spielberg utilise cette sc\u00e8ne pour faire comprendre au public que chaque soldat avait une vie bien ordinaire et que la guerre n'\u00e9tait pas leur but ultime. Un autre exemple de ce message est la lettre que le soldat Caparzo avait \u00e9crit \u00e0 son p\u00e8re. Cette lettre est un symbole de la perspective historique des soldats, car elle d\u00e9montre que les soldats pensaient fr\u00e9quemment \u00e0 leur famille et qu'ils n'\u00e9taient pas consum\u00e9 par la guerre. D'autre part, le discours du Capitaine Miller dans lequel il d\u00e9voile son m\u00e9tier est une exemple parfait du message de ce film. En effet, Miller dit que \"quand les gens dans ma ville natale apprennent que je suis un enseignant, il se disent que cela fait du sens. [Traduction libre]\" Nous n'imaginons pas souvent les enseignants en train d'assaillir une plage, et c'est ce que Spielberg veut que nous remarquons: chaque soldat n'est qu'un homme ordinaire qui ne cherche pas n\u00e9cessairement \u00e0 se battre.\nSelon moi, ce film est une repr\u00e9sentation partiellement pr\u00e9cise. Plusieurs \u00e9l\u00e9ments sont v\u00e9ridiques, ce qui rend le film tr\u00e8s r\u00e9aliste. Par exemple, dans le film, plusieurs soldats qui d\u00e9fendent la plage Omaha ne parlent pas Allemand. En effet, les Nazis ont utilis\u00e9s des soldats conscrits de l'europe de l'est pour d\u00e9fendre leurs plages, car ils ne voulaient pas utiliser leurs propres soldats. Un autre \u00e9l\u00e9ment exact est l'histoire d'un soldat am\u00e9ricain qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rapatri\u00e9 en raison de la mort de ses fr\u00e8res. Par contre, nous parlons ici des fr\u00e8res Nilands et non des Ryans. Fritz Niland, tout comme James Ryan \u00e9tait un parachutiste am\u00e9ricain qui s'\u00e9tait \u00e9gar\u00e9 lors de son saut. Sa m\u00e8re, Mme Niland, allait \u00eatre inform\u00e9e de la mort de ses trois fils en m\u00eame temps, alors le gouvernement a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ramener Fritz \u00e0 la maison, tout comme dans le film. Un troisi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment exact est la partie strat\u00e9gique du d\u00e9barquement en Normandie. Il est vrai que plusieurs sections se sont perdues et il y avait beaucoup de confusion lors de l'arriv\u00e9e des soldats. Cela \u00e9tant dit, quelques aspects du film Saving Private Ryan sont faux. Par exemple, la sc\u00e8ne du Jour-J est grandement exag\u00e9r\u00e9e en terme de morts et de violence. Sur la plage Omaha, il y avait 50 000 soldats, mais seulement 2 500 y ont laiss\u00e9 la vie. Ceci diff\u00e8re du film, car la plupart des soldats sur la plage meurent, tandis qu'en vraie vie, la plupart ont surv\u00e9cus. \nEn conclusion, je crois que le film Saving Private Ryan est un bon outil pour que les \u00e9l\u00e8ves puissent comprendre la perspective historique des soldats de la DGM. Selon moi, le d\u00e9barquement en Normandie est grandement exag\u00e9r\u00e9, donc je recommanderais plut\u00f4t le film The Longest Day.",

Instead, it's a condemnation of war wrapped in a tale of human courage and sacrifice. There's nothing especially complex about the structure of Saving Private Ryan. The film, which runs nearly three hours, is bookended by two major battle scenes. In between, smaller fights alternate with quiet, character-building moments that flesh out the soldiers, allowing them to escape the threat of stereotyping. Spielberg, along with writer Robert Rodat and the actors, ensures that everyone in the movie is developed into a multi-dimensional individual for whom we can grieve if and when they die. The action sequences are some of the best ever captured in any genre and the opening Omaha landing sequence which runs almost half an hour is a tour de force of filmmaking. This film is simply unmissable. (The master creates magic- One of the greatest WW2 films ever).",

Then, they go to France in order to save a lost soldier.\n \nThe cast is wonderful, this movie has actors like Tom Hanks as Pvt. Miller, Matt Damon as Ryan. Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns and Vin Diesel. Tom Hanks was the voice of Woody in \"Toy Story\" and appeared in \"Cast Away\". Matt Damon has been in \"Jason Bourne\" or \"The Martian\" . The acting is spectacular, you can feel the fear and the anguish that the characters have in the battles. \n\nA soldier called Ryan lost all his brothers in the war and he got lost. His mother will receive a message about the death of all his sons. Pvt. Miller and a group of soldiers have to save Ryan to have good news for his mom.\n\nI know it's a movie from 1996, but the scenes are so realistic and good that I can't tell the difference with a modern movie. The soundtrack fits very well with a war movie. The fights are so intense, the explosions feel real and the characters are memorable. Knowing that the soldiers that died had a family makes the movie very sad.\n\nIn conclusion, Saving Private Ryan is an amazing movie with emotional moments.\nI'll give the movie a 9/10 because sometimes the camera moves too fast. This movie is for adult and teen audiences and they will enjoy every second of the movie, the performances are so good. The fans will be really happy, because this war movie feels real. The story is great, it has a great lesson about giving your life for the happiness of someone.\nIt has a very sad atmosphere because lots of soldiers died instantly. \nBy Angello",

The first 25 minutes is basically a war battle but if you really think about it, the amount of technical detail you have to put in it is extremely difficult but it is not just the technical detail that makes the scene amazing but you feel what the men are going through and in some cases make you feel like you are actually in the battle. When Wade dies it is very disturbing and hard to watch but it is also very powerful. The plot of the movie is to bring Ryan back home to saftey because 3 of his brothers have died in combat so a group of soldiers are out looking for him. Tom Hanks gives a incredable performance and I found him once again extremely likable. Tom Sizemore is surprisingly really good and so is Giovanni Ribisi. Edward Burns, Adam Goldberg, Berry Pepper, and Jeremy Davies are also good and hold their own. This movie is also good at representing it's soldiers more as ordinary people as oppose to a soldier with no flaws and all he thinks about is serving his country. I am not gonna lie, I cried at the end of this movie when Cpt. Miller dies and that is because I grew attached to his character. The character of John Miller is a teacher and just wants to go home and he is forced into a position he does not want to be in. This movie is about characters in a awful situation and seeing how these characters react to war. Many people point out not giving the other countries a huge amount of characterization is a flaw but I personally viewed it as how we view other countries when we are at war and our perspective on them. Great war movie and this is one of Steven Speilbergs best.",

            "content": "It took me 20 years to decide to watch this, due to my general aversion to Tom Hanks alone or in combination with Steven Spielberg (who, as a director, often veers toward heavy-handedness).  However, this war movie is visceral and gripping enough to overcome the inevitable weaknesses associated with its star and auteur director.  So, yes, we are strongly encouraged to endorse Spielberg's view of the \"greatest generation\" as uniquely courageous and noble, overcoming horrific obstacles and bonding together as a team, with John Williams' soundtrack sweeping us along and Hanks' central Captain modelling bravery as a do-no-wrong caring and sympathetic but ordinary guy thrust into an impossible situation.  Maybe the war really was like this for some and I offer all of the veterans my thanks and gratitude.  Fortunately, the film isn't all glorification - we do see moments of fear, cowardice, dissent, and cruelty from the Americans that probably better reflect the width of human experience in this sort of crucible.  However, critic Jonathan Rosenbaum argues that Spielberg hasn't offered anything new that past war movies haven't also shown and perhaps that is true.  But this production added a level of grotesque \"realism\" and \"you are there\" action/violence that might not have been possible before 1998 - it led to Spielberg's subsequent involvement with WWII based video games and you can see the influence (bi-directional, most likely).  The central plot conceit, that Hanks and his small band (of soon-to-be known young actors) must find Private Ryan (Matt Damon) whose three brothers have already been killed in order to send him home to his grieving mama, allows the characters to reflect on the meaningfulness of their actions and adds another dimension to the film, a focus on the guilt and sadness of those who survived.  Although the film doesn't seem to contain any anti-war messages (perhaps because the moral justifications were so strong in that particular war), thinking about the post-traumatic stress of the former combatants (after seeing the visceral and brutal re-enactments here) is enough to ward anyone off from promoting war as a way to resolve differences.  That said, a case could be made for the film as an army recruitment campaign for those who love action, maybe.",

            "content": "A harrowing war story with heartfelt heroes.\n\nDirector Steven Spielberg's war drama epic Saving Private Ryan (1998) remains a moving drama, thrilling war action thriller, and a thoughtful film about morality in times of war. Saving Private Ryan is perhaps Steven Spielberg's most beloved war film ever. He painstakingly recreates D-Day on the beaches of Normandy. It's beautiful and horrifying simultaneously. You're right alongside the soldiers coming off the ships as they desperately run up the beach to capture the German bunker strongholds. It's bloody and brutal with a sense of gritty realism. \n\nI think Spielberg's direction is by far the best aspect of Saving Private Ryan. It's stream lined as you get to follow a company searching for the last son in a larger family that was all killed in World War II. It's a nice story that reels in audiences everywhere. It's about the value of life, love of family, and the unbearable cost of war. WWII truly feels senseless during the sequences of mortar fire, tank battles, and endless crossfire in a furious hail of bullets. It was necessary to stop the Germans, but we witness the devastating consequences of losing infantry among the territories regained. Saving Private Ryan's greatest accomplishment is making you understand the real value of life. It's worth watching as a testament to those who died during WWII. It touches you in ways you'll find hard to describe. Saving Private Ryan is life affirming as Ryan deeply desires to live a fulfilling life to honor his fallen heroes who got him home.\n\nI found the emotional scenes to be sentimental, but deeply felt from Spielberg's incredible cast. It feels genuine through the sincerity with which Tom Hanks plays the squad's leader. Every battle or encounter is followed by scenes of profound grief, regret, hopelessness, and the need for perseverance and purpose. Writer Robert Rodat hits home with his complex views on morality. You see Germans gun down medics and civilians in evil displays of ruthlessness to the aggressive American forces, frustrated with the senseless violence and aggressions of the German soldiers. \n\nEvery moment is a moral choice, not is killing bad, but rather are the lives lost on this mission worth Ryan's alone?. I feel that of course Ryan's life is not worth more than any other soldier risking their life to defeat Germany, but that it is a profound kindness to send home a mother's last son alive after she has just lost three of her other boys. Ryan can only live his life as best he can, but all the men were valiant in the line of duty. Even the coward Upham ends up killing the German that Hanks spared earlier as some men are too evil to let live. I like that Upham is included as everyone thinks they would be brave in combat, but if many of humanity were themselves in a violent situation, they might just be as cowardly as Upham. Saving Private Ryan is about the nuances of courage as Tom Hanks portrays a simple teacher, who bravely answers the call of duty to lead and inspire despite his fears and doubts. You get all kinds of men herein.\n\nTom Hanks is fascinating, cool, moving, and brave as stalwart Captain John H. Miller. You see Hanks making choices and feeling his unthinkable burden. Hanks' speech about remembering the 94 men that died under his command is haunting and sympathetic. Saving Private Ryan is up there with Tom Hanks' best roles and greatest films. He should have won Best Actor in all honesty. Tom Sizemore is fierce and loyal as Technical Sergeant Michael Horvath. Edward Burns is intriguing as the increasingly angry and jaded Private Richard Reiben. Matt Damon is at first arrogant and unlikable Private James Francis Ryan, but he earns his stripes as he valiantly defends the bridge under fire.\n\nBarry Pepper should have gotten a Best Supporting Actor as the skilled and faithful sniper Private Daniel Jackson. His sniping sequences are breathtaking as he prays to God for strength as he rapidly reloads and blows away Nazis with extreme precision. Pepper is gripping like few actors ever get to be on the silver screen. Adam Goldberg is hilarious and devastating as the Jewish soldier Private Stanley Mellish. Goldberg finds the balance of Mellish's rage and sorrow at the horrors the German Nazis have unleased upon his people. Vin Diesel got me pretty upset to see what happens to him just because his character Private Adrian Caparzo wants to save a child. Giovanni Ribisi is haunting as he witnesses brutal wounds and begs for his mother as T-Medic Irwin Wade.\n\nTed Danson has a great cameo as Captain Fred Hamill. Jeremy Davies is fantastic as the well meaning interpreter and cowardly ammo holder Corporal Timothy Upham. The entirety of Saving Private Ryan you can see how Upham was not made for war and fails in his responsibility to protect his fellow allies. Paul Giamatti is funny and serious as the helpful Sergeant William Hill. Nathan Fillion has a funny scene as Minnesota Ryan. Leland Orser is immediately mesmerizing as the worn down Lieutenant DeWindt. Bryan Cranston has a nice cameo as War Department Colonel.\n\nMichael Kahn's editing takes you around a war torn France and all over the battlefield with slick cuts. 169 minutes passes by quickly due to Kahn's fast pace and sterling ability to know when to show a close-up of a character's face for deeper emotional empathy. \n\nCinematographer Janusz Kami\u0144ski's wide shots for all the battle sequences are glorious like his interesting framing for each man's thinking about his family, values, or losses. I love how up close and personal his shots get with shaking camera work like you're a soldier right beside Spielberg's heroes. All the sets are realistic, booming sounds echo, and gore effects appear real for Saving Private Ryan's stunning technical achievements.\n\nComposer John Williams provides a lovely and eerie score that rises with good intentions and forlorn feelings. Williams' melodies are simply stunning. Even the music is masterful in Saving Private Ryan.\n\nOverall, Saving Private Ryan is still one of the must see war films in cinema history. You'll be stunned at the scope of the D-Day invasion and humbled at Hanks' acting and empathy. Give it a watch.",

I love how intimate this movie allows us to get with the characters, because it had me 100% invested in their struggle. The graphic nature of the violence feels authentic and well-earned, even if it is somewhat easy to foresee when it\u2019s coming. It is a long movie, and there are probably a few areas where it could have been trimmed, but the length makes you feel the unending tension of war and how it can wear on you. I have to admit that I did not enjoy Edward Burns or Adam Goldberg in this film. I can\u2019t say exactly why, but they both rub me the wrong way, and I never felt they blended into the era. Aside from those two, the cast is great and all feel like they fit their role nicely.

Even with its flaw, I'm giving this the highest score.\n For more of my movie reviews and updates on blockbuster movie news check out my blog: mtmovieblog.wixsite.com/mtmovieblog",

            "content": "I've seen several war films recently spanning several conflicts and each time I say whatever I have just watched is the ultimate war film. \nWell do you know what? I am going to say it again.\nDirected by Steven Spielberg who is perhaps more known for his blockbuster family films but every now and then he pulls a film like this out of the hat. \nThe technical abilities demonstrated by this film make it stand out from your average World War II film.\nThe sound effects from the first twenty minutes or so as the Americans land on the beaches of Northern France are amazing. Never mind the visual effects.\nI only watched on a 32\" TV so I can only imagine what it sounded like amplified in a cinema.\nThose first twenty minutes must have cost a fortune  (in filmmaking). The visual effects are quite stunning and really project the firmness of the battle scene.\nI have never been particularly endeared to actor Tom Hanks. I've found him geeky and downright annoying from what I've seen in some of his other films but he fully deserved his Oscar for his performance as a U.S. Rangers Captain.\nA youthful Matt Damon plays Private Ryan who is given the devastating news that his three brothers have been killed in action. Hanks on a mission to return him 'home' to his mother.\nThe film is three hours long but kept me engrossed throughout an achievement that so many 'epics' fail at the first hurdle!\nI just wished I saw this at the cinema back in 1998 at about a time when I saw so many sub-standard films.",

            "content": "An extraordinarily made film that shows us that war is ugly, but through a deep and entertaining story. \n\nSteven Spielberg directed this powerful, realistic re-creation of WWII's D-day invasion and the immediate aftermath. The story opens with a prologue in which a veteran brings his family to the American cemetery at Normandy, and a flashback then joins Capt. John Miller (Tom Hanks) and GIs in a landing craft making the June 6, 1944, approach to Omaha Beach to face devastating German artillery fire. This mass slaughter of American soldiers is depicted in a compelling, unforgettable 24-minute sequence. Miller's men slowly move forward to finally take a concrete pillbox. On the beach littered with bodies is one with the name \"Ryan\" stenciled on his backpack. Army Chief of Staff Gen. George C. Marshall (Harve Presnell), learning that three Ryan brothers from the same family have all been killed in a single week, requests that the surviving brother, Pvt. James Ryan (Matt Damon), be located and brought back to the United States. \n\nSo I've never been a fan of movies made pre-2000's. It's not that I don't want to be, but I just haven't enjoyed older styles of filmmaking. However, being a lover of war films, I've been told repeatedly that I have to watch \"Saving Private Ryan\". Now being in college and having access to an on campus library where I can check out movies, I decided it was finally time. So, I checked out \"Saving Private Ryan\" and to my added surprise, I had a ton of fun with this film. \n\nLet's start out by saying that this is an all-star cast. A lot of guys from top to bottom have all made strong careers for themselves to date. A lot of them put up great performances, to the point where it's hard to point out any individual performance other than Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks really led the cast here and puts up an amazing performance like always. I love seeing him, as there haven't been a ton of films with him lately, so it's nice to see an older movie where he originally starred. I think even if you're not interested in this film, you should give it a chance based on the cast alone. \n\nFor a film made nearly two decades ago, it still holds up really well. Everything from the effects, set design, acting, etc, all hold up really well. This is honestly a film that could've been made today, just with a dated resolution. I think a lot of things were really strong, especially the fact that this film was a bit hard to watch at times. It goes with the strong message that war is ugly and nothing about it is pretty. The situation they're put in and no matter how many medals or awards you receive, nothing about the situation is fun. You're watching people die and limbs being blown off, and none of it is glorified. It's all supported with a fantastic score and it all came together to give us a really complete war film.\n\nIn the end, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and it was actually one of the best war films I've ever seen. Chalk that up as a win for 90s movies.",

At least in my books, it's the most complete war movie ever, it covers all aspect of a war, from the glory to the regret. It got realistic action ranging from battalion battle sequences to small squad action. The opening sequence was the most intense and gory battle scene I have come across. Got a human story to tell, the on-road adventure of a squad shows us all the faces of war, got camaraderie, humor, resentment, bravery, and cowardice. In the end not sure if it's an anti-war movie or a celebration of war. \n\nWatched the movie for the second time only, first being at the time of its release. Even though it's close to 20 years since its release, it's still got production values to make you feel it might have been released last year. The direction along with the performance by the cast makes it's a masterpiece.  The only complain I have is it was a tad too long.",

It is bewtiching as to how Spielberg creates these prolonged realistically graphic sequences of combat. The first 25-minute war battle is so convincing and blistering, that it doesn't give the viewers the time to fathom the deep-dyed, macabre series of carnage. The movie follows Normandy Landings, a band of U.S soldiers go behind enemy lines to fetch a paratrooper whose brothers have been killed in a blitz. Tom Hanks once again gives a concrete performance of an actor, so did Matt Damon and others.  Me personally, this is my favourite war movie precursor to Hacksaw Ridge, Braveheart and Downfall.",

            "content": "Saving Private Ryan has taught a lot about how awful war is. Director Steven Spielberg, did a phenomenal job on portraying how gruesome and violent war is. Especially in the opening scene when the American troops are occupying Omaha Beach on D Day. The D Day scene of the movie was very surreal and it felt like as if the audience was in the battle. With artillery shells going off, machine gun bullets whizzing by, and seeing all the violence go on, it just seemed like a really scary but accurate portrayal of D Day. Many Allied troops died on D Day, yet it was the turning point of the war.Overall director Steven Spielberg did a wonderful job on creating this film. The movie covered on all points of how war can be so horrible. War is not only horrible because of mass casualties, but it is also horrible because of our own connections and feelings. Throughout this movie I felt like I built some type of emotional connection to each of the characters, and seeing the tragic events unfold made me realize that war is not only bad because of killing, it is also awful because we lose people that can mean something to us. With that being said, many young men, just getting out of high school were being sent to fight this war, but behind each and every one of them, there's someone who cares and loves them, like a family. Which is exactly the story behind Private Ryan, he was the last of the brothers in the family. \n\nIn the movie, all of the Ryan brothers die except for Private Ryan. He was the last man alive in the family to carry on the name. The main focus of the movie jumps right into action after the D Day scene when eight American troops are assigned to save Private Ryan, the last of the four brothers alive in the family, and bring him home. Many challenges are yet to be seen on these soldiers' journey to find this young man, and in the unfortunate fate of war, some of the soldiers will die on their way to find the Private. Throughout the whole movie, and even up to finding Private Ryan, we see a series of unfortunate events unfold, and once the group of men find Private Ryan, the plot becomes even more climatic, as the German forces close in om the American troops.\n\nSaving Private Ryan was one of those movies that I could connect with so well, it tells a unique story and shows us all that war is awful. In fact, many people avoided watching this movie due to all of the gore and violence that was shown.  It also taught me as an individual to appreciate our vets more, because without them our country wouldn't be where it is today. Steven Spielberg did such a fantastic job on covering the aspects of war, and as well as focusing on the plot of the movie",

When fighting this war we wish we could see to what is coming to us when we only see it our way but others see differently to stop us in our tracks. When death we cover those from seeing this war when they are in a peaceful place now. When somethings we see we stumble upon when we come face to face with the enemy to see whom gives us first, when we both see eye to eye that we are relentless and not giving up without a fight. When we have eyes everywhere that the more eyes to see with the more better the chance in hitting our enemy.\n\nWhen whom we see, we think we are seeing but turn out to be different. When we see many are displaced when we directed some places, stumble upon some places, and stuck to some places. When we just know some places sre not meant for others to see when they have to be in other places taking care of what they need to see at home. When some people we keep seeing we remember when they were in the wrong place as well when we ought to see to their safety. When we see some faces we know and care about when we see them for quite a long time to know whom they are to see how special and great they were to us that others wouldn't be able to see like could. When what we don't see now we see later when we see somethings all wrong. When we see one man's life is worth another, when we ought to see no man's life is worth one man's fascist greed. When some faces we can't seem to get out of our head when we wished we could see some people whom makes see life so delicately and precious. When what we see or hear we can't ignore or go to sleep when we see alot but can't help but know others are seeing their ends fighting what they can't see at night. When we see we have a lot of areas to cover to not see we end up in some places where it's worst. When we see some had it worst to land in some places they never intended to be, when we are taken down but heavy fire. When we couldn't have seen somethings coming to steer away to see we lost a lot of lives. When we come to see if one man is here that we come down for to see we are making a fool out ourselves in the process. When we make sure we make our enemies see whom we are to making sure we make our fellow men see whom we are when we respect see what they been through to show a little humanity. When we begin to see life come and go to not be bothered whom comes in our midsts. When we see we are all headed to the right direction when we know we are going the right way, to see we are close to our targets. When we see are covering a lot of ground, when we see our own people in shit shape fighting what we are not seeing when they got to them first. When we see closer we get to our targets, the closer we see our way home. When we see some areas we can't avoid when we need to see we get to see some people on the other side. When what we see we see no room for error when others need to trust in what we see to get ourselves to the other side. \n\nWhen what we see we must kill, when we need to see the otherside. When we don't need others close by to see from the far side. When we see we have seen a lot of death and lives we saved to see ourselves helpless in saving our own when we are a casualty of war. When we see we are good at seeing somethings but not everything in seeing to those safe. When we see life just up and go from near and far, fast to now slow to see we see it all and sick of seeing these piece of shits alive. When we see it could have been alot worse if we didn't see to stopping it. When we see somethings must die to see our ticket home. When we had enough seeing life go when we all see life the same way as those we see go to know we hate it here and want to go home. When we see somethings want to see themselves like us when our old self could get us killed. When we are seen as fools, to see how a caged animal have no humanity left dig himself out the same hole he got himself in. When we see we do have some humanity and good left to not see eye to eye with those whom rather see pieces of shit dead. When we see we are all fighting the same war to see we rather fight whom we don't see eye to eye with when we can no longer trust others to see we over us. When all we want to see is home in our simple life we enjoy seeing when we compare it with what we see here. When seeing somethings we once used to see is something when we once had a feeling before this war started to know what would remain once we see home. When we will always see war and all what we have done to know we can salvage one single piece of decency and humanity thst earns us to feel home once again. \n\nWhen somethings we see we position ourselves make our targets true. When somethings we don't intend to see, we stumble upon seeing the true target we came for. When we see what others came long and far to make us see to know we only see it our way, when we see our ways is what what our brothers would like us to see it not abandoning on those whom we sworn to see & protect. When we do see it from others perspectives to know we see some tickets home are not easy to come by when it's much harder when we have to see to those safe. When we see we the importance of what we have to do know we see all our tickets home in one plane in the right direction with whom we see eye to eye with. When we see what we have to work with, when what we see on the ground others can't see from up high when we are seeing to our own tickets home. When we must see we cover all areas to see we get our targets with little we see can hold them off. When we see somethings to know we see somethings small when we take them under our wing when we see it like a mother would see it to get them home. When we see other things that can overpower us with their engenuity we see we are in for a hell of a fight. When we see we can't move forward no more to hold somethings back. When we see other things overpower us when they are moving and we haven't seen somethings in a long while when it's a women's voice we yearn to hear after seeing so much men to have enough of it. When we see how happy it is to feel and see somethings to move us that we can't seem to see anymore when it hurts thinking about it. When what we came here for we see, we dreaded thinking about, after seeing it over and over again in our head to see it all begins and ends with this fight. When what we see we wish we to no longer see when we only wish to see the world one more time. When we ought to see that every has enough to keep seeing when we are seeing one side win. When seeing everything from we need to see, seeing that we live in a better world, keep those safe guarded to seeing we can't do it when we we cone all this way to see we don't belong here, we never did see the point of all if this war shit, we just see to others die without us lifting a finger. When we have always seen to seeing we help our own to having no one to see over us when it's our end. \n\nWhen we see we all end up everywhere fighting separate battles we see we ought to be fighting, we can't help but not see them when we are sering our own ends, seeing we have to give up, seeing we can't move anymore when we are exhausted, wounded, and can't see ourselves go any longer we can't see why GOD DIDN'T TAKE US SOONER AND WHAT REASON WOULD HE BRING US ALL THIS WAY? WHEN IT IS TO MAKE US SEE, WE ARE DESTINED TO LEAD TILL THE VARY END. When we see what we must do in the end, to fight for good and every humanly possible reason. When to see GOD HAS A PLAN FOR US ALL IN THE END TO SEND ANGELS TO SEE TO OUR SIDE WINNING, TO SEE WE PROTECT WHAT IS RIGHT, WHAT IS GOOD, WHAT WE WISH TO SEE LIFE MOVE FORWARD, AND SEE HOME AGAIN WHERE WE BELONG. When we see others got to see us safe, followed their orders and duty to their country, men, and humanity by doing what so little could do or see forward doing when humanity was once on the grips of a different world power seeing how humanity should live, until it was brave men whom risked their lives to sacrifice it all so we could live with the freedoms we see today. When we see whom we owe everything to, to see we made you proud in what you gave us and what you see is earned. When not many could see what we been through to know that many sit and watch in the comforts of their homes what we saw hands on, that they never again SEE THIS KIND OF WAR HAPPEN AGAIN. When we owe you a debt of honour that we see we could never repay back, but always remember to see all those whom given their lives on that faithful day.",

            "content": "Saving Private Ryan is by far in my opinion the best war movie ever made. The opening battle scene on Omaha beach during D-Day is the best war action scene I've seen. The plot of the movie is that Private Ryan's brothers are killed. One in New Guinea, another on Omaha beach, and the other on a different beach during D-Day. Because of this, Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) is sent out to find Private James Francis Ryan so that he can go home. \nNow of course the plot of the movie may sound a little far fetch, but it in no way deters from the horrors of World War 2 in the European theater. I like how the movie doesn't try to villify the german soldiers. At least in the beginning of the movie, when the American soldiers are able to take the beach, two soldiers come across what appears to be a couple of nazis trying to surrender. They're saying it in their native tongue and the Americans are unable to understand them. Because of that they were shot and one of the soldiers replies to his buddy saying, \"Look, I washed for supper.\" What the soldiers were actually saying was, \"Please don't shoot me, I am not German, I am Czech, I didn't kill anyone.\" This cements that there's no real good side in war. Each side is in it for their own reasons whether that's for \"fighting for freedom,\" or being forced to fight as the case here. \nWhat I like about this movie is that all of the characters are likable and memorable. From the tough, hard-hitting Brooklyn Native Reiben, to the soft hearted Upham. My favorite being Jackson, the resilient sniper played by the awesome Barry Pepper. \nI think this is the best performance by Matt Damon I've seen. At first he's unwilling to leave as he believes it's his duty to fight alongside his \"new\" family, the Airborne troops. And because of this, Captain Miller and his squad help the Airborne troops defend a town from the German army. \nFrom the action sequences, to the small character moments, this movie has great performances, and what I feel is the best War movie ever made.",

That beginning scene man. Probably the most intense beginning to any movie I've seen. Seeing that blood-stained shore was awful. Wonderful surprise to Bryan Cranston's face. Makes me want to watch Breaking Bad now. \n\nSeeing how quickly the U.S. military overtook the shores of Omaha was surprising with all their naval fleets and blimps. This movie plays out almost like a video game I've played, several. Tom Hanks always plays wonderful characters. \n\nMatt Damon's teeth are too damn white in this movie. The set locations are amazing, you feel like your really there. This movie is a true war movie because you get the feeling that at any time anyone can die. Especially with the way it was filmed. I love the use of hand held camerawork in this movie. You get the feeling your really there.\n\nThat kid who was a coward who couldn't save his army buddy really pissed me off. Might as well die in the war if your going to be a pussy. It's movies like these that really make me hate war. The things people have to go through the hell they have to witness. Seeing there fellow brother die or watching a human burn alive or be blown to smithereens. It fucks a person up emotionally, physically, and spiritually. I wish wars never existed. But thankfully, were at a point now where wars have decreased and we're seeing less violence. Let's hope it stays that way.\n\nOverall, this movie is a testimony in showing that wars are useless and viscous. They can break a man down, kill him, or even scar him for the rest of his life. Once a person goes to war, it never leaves them even after the war. War never changes is a powerful phrase that rings true with this movie. Brilliant acting by the way.",

            "content": "WHAT I LIKED: 'Saving Private Ryan' really is one of the best war films out there, and that's because in the same gut-punching, tear-jerking breath, it's equally an attempt at an anti-war film. Yes, in another stroke of assurance, Spielberg manages to bring an experience that protrays the true, horrible evil that an event like this really posesses in a way that still packs emotional punch for the regular movie-goer. Sure, some rivals have plugged grittier, grosser overall narratives that put you in touch with the horrors far more, but it's the heart-felt human side of this story that allows all of that to hit closer to home than many might expect. This is thanks to great character development from Robert Rodat's script and Tom Hanks, as well as a plenty of breathing room, and in the end you'll not only leave with your eyes wide open, but also with a lump in your throat, and manier tear in your eye.\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: Structurally, the story does have a tendency to drag its boots a little in the second act where the heart takes over from the reality for just a little too long.\nVERDICT: A gritty war movie with a genuine heart. That may sound contradictory, but for the most part, all that allows 'Saving Private Ryan' to hit very hard indeed.",

            "content": "(Spoilers) The movie is about a platoon ordered to search for Private James Ryan (Matt Damon) during World War 2 while fighting the German army in France. In the beginning of the movie you see an old man heading to the grave a fallen soldier and that soldier is Captain James Miller (Tom Hanks)  the captain and his platoon ordered to take James home. The memories come to James as the scene was taken to the bays of France, D-day. The first soldier on the American side was shot on the head, so it started the action of the movie with bombs going off while the Americans and other allies tried to storm towards the beach eventually with the allies succeeding on the assault. Later that day James Miller got the orders to get a soldier named Private James Ryan to take him home because his other two brothers died in action. Private Ryan was a few miles away so Captain Miller throughout the movie along with a few other soldiers tried to get Ryan in the processes two soldiers died. They found Ryan and found out where he was stationed, they tell him the news and he doesn't want to go home he wants to stay there with his brother which is noble of him. Captain Miller agreed to stay and fight till reinforcements arrive against the German army. Ryan was still young, but mature enough to realize i need to stay here and fight. The whole platoon dies and reinforcements come at the last minute, now at this Miller was shot and Ryan stands in front of him as he laid dying, that's when the scene changed to the present day when Ryan is an old man. He never forget what Miller did and he reflects on it everyday of his life. \n     This movie had its intense moments along with moments that made you feel more connected with the characters. Those moments that had its reality check making us realize that these men just enjoy the little things and are just wanting to go home to their families. The effects of War can leave lasting memories like it did with Ryan, but at the same time during the War others see them as superhuman, but they are just humans that are stressed and paranoid out of there minds. Even though Miller was a Captain and is supposed to show leadership and no fear, he takes his time to mourn and cry for his fallen soldiers because the pressure is just too much for him to take and just wants to go home. The movie had a good interpretation of D day in the beginning by applying the gun fire, landmines, and the sounds of soldiers using their battle cry, screaming in pain, or just shocked on the dead laying on the shore. That is the scene that got me hooked to the movie, also including the final battle in the town in France having that Alamo feeling being outnumbered by the Nazis. Overall the movie is worth watching and it makes you appreciate more for what these service men and women have to sacrifice, the story itself is good with good characters to back it up going more in depth to how they are feeling mentally and physically and the backlash it can have later in their lives.   \n\n-- Fernando V.",

Saving Private Ryan is about a make-shift task force, led by Captain Miller, assigned by the highest rank to search for Private Ryan and bring him, the last sibling of his family alive, home to his mother following the Normandy landings. This is probably the most patriotic movie ever made, in all seriousness, but is not for the faint of heart. The opening invasion scene ALONE showcases absolutely horrifying depictions of injuries, chaos, emotion, and all around extremely disgusting imagery, shot in hauntingly beautiful handheld cam, often held by Spielberg himself, in hands-DOWN, the most visually immersive film I've ever seen. The characters are very realistic as well, with layers, and not just one definitive personality trait, but rather agreeing with one another, and subduing emotion during scarring moments, and for the most part, we don't rely on backstory to relate to the heros, but rather their acting and live delivery in intimate conversations. The narrative is beautifully woven in with subtle thoughts expressed between characters to build up to the extremely powerful message near the end. Overall, this is a nearly flawless film with world class camerawork and cinematography, Oscar worthy performances, and home-hitting themes and moments. Saving Private Ryan is a 10/10",

The depiction of war is really horrifyingly realistic, in fact it's the most realistic war film I've seen so far. Tom Hanks as always gives a great performance in this film which made it 100 times better, he is a master at what he does, he never makes an okay performance, he always gives it his all. Amazing direction, top notch acting, an amazing first sequence and a very emotional final act mixed altogether to make the best war film of all time. (Not exagerating)",

In figuring out his favorite movie of all time he said Saving Private Ryan. I heard so much about this film from the war action sequences to the acitng to just spielbergs continued growth as a legendary director. And so in the words of the great Harrison Ford in Star wars the force awakens \"it's true....All of it.\" Saving Private Ryan has been officially added to my list of favorite war film as it is second behind platoon but still this movie is incredible.\n\tThe always amazing Tom Hanks stars as Captain John Miller who is leading a unit in the middle of World War II. After surving D-Day he gets word that among a group of brothers who died one sole sibling by the name of James Ryan is alive and stuck in a section of Germany. Miller takes his men and sets out to find private ryan. Along the way he see the true comradiere and will to fight and bring back one of their own even if they aren't part of their batillion.\n\tThis movie is without a doubt a war classic I mean the first 10 minutes had me hooked. you can feel and smell the adrenaline of the fight in Normandy. unbelievable directing from Spielberg. he really shifts a bit from his usual directing style and delivers in this film. the sound design was just as real too. nice editing and camera work very similar to the birdman revenant style of shooting and cutting scenes together\nTom Hanks and every body in this movie truly were giving it all they had in their performances. Absolutely spectacular! Hanks portrayal of John Miller was incredible. He really was the glue to this slightly disfuctional yet loyal and fierce some group of soldiers. He takes on this mission even though he doesn't know this solider, but that comradiere and brotherhood every solider has acts as his motivation to go forth with this mission and bring this boy home to his mother. Soliders have a duty to protect the country and also look out for each other and leave no one behind. crazy looking at a young vin diesel and paul giamatti in here. matt damon does a really good job here and through the his dialogue kind hints at the real heart of the film one man over several others what do you do? that story\nAgain I must state how Incredibly realistic this film is! the cinematography is to die for so well shot. You feel so immersed into every location and are with the Soliders every moment its. incredible script from the writers. lastly that final fight was remarkable and so intense!\nSaving Private Ryan lives up to its legacy. Anybody who loves Spielberg NEEDS to watch this film!",

Having watched it recently (May 2016) I was, rather unsurprisingly, emotionally affected. \n\nThe film has a perfect blend of intense action and a unique war-time narrative. I feel though, however, that the smaller stories behind each of the characters really added to their plausibility. The film pulls off character development and action in such a way that you would be forgiven for thinking that this film was a documentary (maybe that is pushing it a bit). \n\nWhen one talks about Saving Private Ryan, you have to consider the ground-breaking opening D-Day sequence that was so brutal that, at the time of release, real WW2 veterans walked out of the film because it was so similar to how they experienced it. \n\nSpielberg stated that during the pre-production of the film that he wanted the film to not glamourise war, as many films did previously, and it does show (the image of one soldier picking up his own dismembered arm during the opening sequence comes to mind). \n\nUnlike previous films in which the traditional view of Allies good and Axis bad, Saving Private Ryan does not do this; no character is presented in such a way that would show them as wholly good or wholly evil, every character has a purpose or, more specifically, an understandable humanistic goal. \n\nI thoroughly recommend that anyone who even considers watching this film do so because it is easily one of the greatest films ever made. However I would warn you that there are plenty of opportunities to be affected emotionally. Such a film is so good that you will think about it for weeks after watching it.

            "content": "Steven Spielberg has been credited a lot for his work on cinema, much like  directors like Kubrick, Scorsese, George & many other directors proved in their lifetime just how well high production big action blockbusters could be well done. With Steven's films like Jaws, Indiana Jones, E.T, Close Encounters, Jurassic Park, Duel, and others he's given his stamp on the industry as a whole and has genuinely earned the respect of almost everyone who's worked in Hollywood. But even for the late 1990's, none of that would come close to ever winning him an Oscar despite his films gaining a high traction in pop culture. That was until his nomination for WW2 film: Schindler's List & this little gem that won him his first ever Academy Award: Saving Private Ryan. This film has been UNIVERSALLY praised for almost how close it reconciles in sentimentality and also it's ultra-grey realism of war in both it's setting, characters, and especially the way it's action sequences play out. So much so that I never personally got the time to give it my fullest attention, up until now. And to get to the question out of the way of whether I liked it or not: YES! I LOVED IT! I never thought there could be such an emotional and disturbing war film quite on this scale before, as someone who enjoys history altogether. And I enjoyed my pleasant surprise to find how the minute the film cuts to it's first action set piece (the one most people consider to be one of the best parts of the whole film) It left quite possibly one of the best impressions for the rest of the film from: Fantastic acting from the squad Captain Miller commands including himself, set pieces so tight and well produced it was downright distracting, cinematography from Janus Kaminski that made me just utterly appreciate how dark and unpleasant the setting for our film is, action so well directed and shot it it's kind of insulting as to why more war films don't follow in this type of format MATURELY, characters so well fleshed out and unpredictable, a story very well written (and not shocking since Frank Darabont, my all time favourite old-school writer/directors) and emotionally gripping it made me forget any issues it plagued, the overly r-rated violence used maturely through the film, and is just....overall is so amazingly well executed that I think it ranks up HIGHLY in my favourite films of all time. And while slight issues are present much like in any film, mostly nitpicky and cynical observations, like the odd slow-motion and sometimes often dragged on pace, this is a film to still GO AND SEE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. Seeing this for the first time really shocked me in how well executed it would be, and gives me a more genuine respect to Spielberg, as it makes me wish he went back to doing R rated films again like Saving Private Ryan. \n\nScore: 9.5 / 10",

'Saving Private Ryan' captures the realistic darkness of humanity and its struggle against the basic morality of right and wrong. Spielberg portrayals death through his smart directing, and never stops to seize the audience through these never ending up-growing characters, due to the fact that we barely understand what they're going through, but somehow never stop to relate to them. It definitely is Oscar-worthy, but it got much more to tell about the dark side of humanity rather than on the war itself; so don't expect a Michael Bay flick, and it sure isn't flawless. The motivation why to save Ryan isn't perfect, and the vast amount of characters drags the depth of the main & excellent ones down. But it's both a major technical & moral achievement.\n\nPersonal rating: 74/100\nCritical rating: 92/100",

In my research, I learned that a few ww2 vets thought saving private ryan was a realistic depiction of ww2. I wasn't there, of course, so I guess my conclusion would be that ww2 was like a tv cop show, like SWAT, or starsky and hutch. Whereas sands of iwo jima, the big red one etc. make ww2 look fairly big, speilberg has made ww2 look like mr. hanks is fighting it all by himself, but with the help of a few personalityless sidekicks, who die in a proportion to how many lines they have. The nazis mr. hanks fights seem like a very small street gang, even less significant than those in west side story.\nIt isn't ww2 that speilberg depicts here, it's his obsession with violence voyeurism. Right off the bat, some one in mr. hanks boat vomits and speilberg lingers on the fact obsessively. On the beach, it could be said that an american soldier \"loses a limb\" if it were not for speilberg making a disgusting pun on the fact that by the length of time of the scene raises questions about mr. speilberg's preoccupation with harm to others. When a nazi is shot in the head, his blood doesn't just spurt out, it spurts out through a hole in his helmet, and continues to do so. I'm not even sure that is possible. The violence seems so amplified that it is almost fantastical. Of course ww2 was violent but speilberg seems to have contrived ways that couldn't possibly be called artful, to make the violence more grandiose than is possible in the real world.\nWhat takes the cake, is a scene in which a nazi has a member of mr. hanks very small unit, in another violent pun: a compromising position. The comparison to love making is uncanny and if it were love making it would result in an x rating not just for the graphicness, but for it's duration - maybe another revolting pun there.\nThere are movies called snuff films, in which actual persons are murdered. It wouldn't surprise me if mr. speilberg has a large collection of them, or takes a hand in making them.",

Employing the services of\nnow famed cinematographer Janusz Kaminski who single-handedly\nreinvented the way in which war films and action in particular was\nshot, the keen eye of long standing editor Michael Kahn, the\nscreen writing abilities of The Patriot scribe Robert Rodat and of\ncourse the musical accompaniment of a John Williams score, Ryan had at\nits disposal the A-team of Hollywood and it shows.\n\nAll around Saving Private Ryan is quality, pure unbridled grace and\nconfidence that fills the film's every frame and it extends to its\neclectic cast of established and at-the-time up and comers which was\nled by the almost never better Tom Hanks. After Hanks' leading man\nCaptain Miller we have Ed Burns's cocky Reiban, Barry Pepper's\nreligiously inclined sharpshooter Jackson, the late Tom Sizemore's\ngruff Horvath, Adam Goldberg's wisecracking Mellish and Jeremy Davis's\njittery language expert Upham. It's a great team and when you throw in\nGiovanni Ribisi, Vin Diesel and of course cinemas most rescued, Matt\nDamon with added bit parts by a one armed Walter White in the form of\nBryan Cranston, a slim lined Paul Giamatti, a non-CSI Ted Danson and\neven a baby faced Nathan Fillion, Ryan acts as a who's who of\nrecognizable actors that each for a small period or large period made\nsure the film was one of the most well-acted of the modern era.\n\nFilled with heart, stunningly filmed sequences of confronting warfare\nand a cast of memorable personnel, Saving Private Ryan is one of a\nhandful of quintessential war films that have managed to somehow in\nvarious states capture what it may have been like to be among the\ncountless wars that have raged over our planet in years gone by.\n\nA deserving Oscar winner that in many ways can be seen as a faultless\nexercise in big budget film-making and the perfect example of a men on\na mission movie done well, Saving Private Ryan is one of, if not the\ngreatest film in Steven Spielberg's outstanding and loaded filmography.\n\n5 greased up socks out of 5\n\nwww.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",

Yeah, one could say that the plot is a bit flimsy, but it's\nperfectly compensated by incredible battle scenes. It is also\nimpossible not to mention the amazing cast. The personalities of\ncharacters are unfolded spectacularly. If you're into war movies you'll\nprobably dive into the story and live through it together with the\nsquad. And this is exatly what really terrific about cinematography. So\nin this way, if you haven't watched this movie yet you should\ndefinitely do it ASAP. I bet it would be one of the most breathtaking\nfilm experience you've ever had.",

Upon rewatching it, it has fallen out of my top 10, but is most definitely in my top 20. I felt that there were a couple of trivial scenes (Do we need to see Miller fumbling around with an empty beverage holder?) and some of the characters are unevenly developed, but Saving Private Ryan still holds up extremely well. The Omaha beach landing is still arguably the greatest war scene ever filmed (It just barely takes the spot over Apocalypse Now's Flight of the Valkyries), and the other war sequences are just as unflinchingly realistic and riveting to watch. There are excellent performances all around, especially from Tom Hanks. I still love the script even if it does have some uneven lines (I can understand why it lost the Screenplay Oscar to Shakespeare in Love). Finally, despite my knowledge of the film's ending, I still nearly cried at the end upon rewatching it. It's still one of Spielberg's finest and one of the best war films ever made. Verdict: A",

            "content": "Included In Lists:\nGreat Movies\n\nThroughout Spielberg's filmography, he has tackled the elements of World War 2 and its upcoming years almost so exhaustively that by seeing his entire catalogue would provide a strong fundamental insight of the event; and each feature is tackled with a flavour of their own, cohesively held by his individual trademarks, and each one unwilling to be a repetition of the other. May it be the heart aching struggles of the Holocaust and the triumphant effort of a single man towards their preservation; or the thrilling and exhilaration of the first and third instalments of the Indiana Jones series, which finds a hero driven to stop the Nazi forces of harnessing the power of rare scattered artefacts; or the perspective of a young prisoner of war in the invasion of China by the Japanese, losing everything that defined him and coming out of it a fractured victim; or the exaggerated sense of paranoia that carried through the minds and hearts of Americans after the tragic assault on Pearl Harbour; or the horrific tragedy that was laid upon the fearing and hopeful soldiers as they land at the shores of Omaha Beach.\n\nHe is a filmmaker who truly understands the event like very few do, finding the most powerful and inspired of stories and communicate them through his audience in a way that is both accessible and entertaining; even if his intentions are dramatically grounded, at times we find ourselves immersed or escaped from our realities, transported to the conditions captured within the frame; and there is no better example of a film that achieves this than Saving Private Ryan, notably in its moments of chaos and desperation. We find ourselves right there armed and donned with military gear, staring up at the opponents who show a lack of mercy in their sights. They fire to hold us back, and we evade and scream to react and ensure our safety. Spielberg simply could have taken the route of an epic filmmaker like David Lean, composing scenes with intelligent and scope that places us far above the mayhem and take on a view of authority or grandeur that would inspire awe in its audience. Spielberg aimed to find a connection into the hearts of these soldiers, to empathise the struggles they had to endure, making the aura of danger and unpredictability palpable with every step from the start zone. It is 30 minutes of necessary mayhem that immediately introduces and comprehends the ideas that are taking form, accumulating to ensure the penetrating impact that would arrive later on.\n\nThis is Spielberg donning a new and harsher coat, never at a moment we find ourselves amused or grinning in moments of heat and tension, taking on a standpoint of violence with honesty and tragedy that very few filmmakers were able to provide since the end of the war; it is an approach that attains a sense of respect to those who entered, either successfully or have fallen, into the battlefield; and this is a statement that not only regards for the exhaustive perspective of Omaha Beach, but of the many moments of warfare after it, demonstrating war for what it truly is, a sacrifice of principles led either through forced or instinctive obligation that ends only with a bloody mess. Despite its detailed portrayal, Spielberg still manages to tap into the deeply shelved desire within us that craves for adrenaline and thrills, managing to balance accuracy and escapism without intrusive compensation that would jeopardise its integrity; a level of effort and respect that many action filmmakers should strive for. Even until now, many have tried to recreate the impact that Spielberg has left his audience with Saving Private Ryan, but I have yet to come across a film that proves to be as effective or as powerful.\n\nThe film finds its way into the soul of its characters as the film refuses to define its figures with identifiable simplicity; many of them do not carry the archetypal traits of one's expectations of a soldier, they are simply a reflection of us, the trivial members of our society. They are instead defined by their attitudes and efforts that are empathetic and universal, demonstrating their hesitations and hopeful wishes in quiet human moments; breathing in between in its unpredictable pit stops of mayhem. Casting may have seemingly taken the route of ambition, with names like Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Edward Burns, Paul Giamatti, Ted Danson, Vin Diesel, and Tom Sizemore, but once we find ourselves standing along these figures, they seem to be stripped form their status, slipping onto their roles with such ease and naturalism that they begin to embody the everyday man that they represent. Both Spielberg and his cast deserves an abundance of the given praise as without their efforts of capturing an atmosphere of such accuracy and grounding, then this wouldn't have been the film that it has become.\n\nThe film finds its footing immediately at the soldiers' arrival of its early high point, providing audiences with an experience like no other, one that could have only been possible by the deep seeded passion and dedication that Spielberg carried for the fallen soldiers and its survivors during its production. It finds the essence of war even in the most chaotic of instances, translating to its viewers through haunting visual imagery and penetrating and accurate first hand embodiment of the soul of a soldier. Spielberg finds himself once again at the pinnacle of his abilities.",

Steven Spielberg did an amazing job with the direction and did his best of giving a vision of what World War II is like. The battle of Ohama Beach is exciting, but scary as it's very realistic, and is the best reenactment about what's it like. The characters are enjoyable and memorable, especially the sniper who I think is one of the best sniper characters in a film. The pacing is slow which would make some viewers bored, but I still got invested in the film. The acting is fantastic, especially Tom Hanks who is entertaining as usual. The writing by Robert Rodat is really good as it does give it some emotional experiences. It has some funny moments, and the soundtrack by John Williams is really good.

That was a pretty good part in the movie and I also like the action and the war scenes that are in it and how it portrays what the soldiers had to go through in war and what it was like during that time for them. Even though I didn't get the movie all that well I thought that it did a good job of explaining and showing WW2.",

Each lead character is brilliantly portrayed and is uniquely different in some way. Tom Hanks leads excellently, and demonstrates the genuine difficulties and responsibilities that a captain would have had during this terrible time. My interest however was not solely with a particular character, but rather the unit as a whole. The action sequences are among the most exciting and dramatic that I have witnessed, particularly the lengthy finale.

After receiving word that all three of Private James Francis Ryan's brothers have been killed in action, the chief of staff has Captain Miller and other select members of the 2nd Rangers go retrieve him from behind enemy lines so as to bring him home. Robert Rodat's script perfectly balances the inhumanity of war and the humanity of its characters, and never veers to the emotionally manipulative, while Spielberg's first-person direction puts you at eye-level with the action and Janusz Kaminski's unbelievable cinematography feels lifted right from 1944.

Steven Spielberg put a lot of time and money into making this movie as perfect as possible. He spent tons of money hiring extras and amputees to play bodies. He wanted to capture the sound a bullet hitting someone makes so he had people record the sound of dead cows being shot. He bought gallons of fake blood to turn the water red. He did a great job of not glorifying war and making the public understand how horrifying war is. This is a must see movie. The thing that really stood out is the realisticness. I would recommend this to everyone as long as they are mature enough and aren't faint of heart. There are plenty of gruesome scenes which might make some hurl. The movie is also historically accurate. The Storming of Normandy unfolded much the way it happened in the movie. The movie is also based off of a true story of four brothers dying in war and a platoon of soldiers being sent to look for the fifth brother to prevent his mother from having to lose all of her sons.  I would definitely recommend this to highschool students because in highschool you decide whether you want to join the military or not. This movie might affect your choice greatly.",

            "content": "Not only is this my favorite Steven Spielberg film, but also my favorite Tom Hanks film, and my favorite war movie of all time. The first twenty minutes alone deserved a Best Picture nod. At least Spielberg won his second Best Director Oscar, previously winning for Schindler's List in 1993. Saving Private Ryan is about army Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) leading his squad (which surprisingly also consisted of Vin Diesel and Giovanni Ribisi) into Normandy, France to rescue Private James Ryan (Matt Damon), the last surviving brother of four soldiers. So as I said, the first twenty minutes consisted of U.S. soldiers storming Omaha Beach... Like, holy shit, wow! Astounding film making that immediately thrusts you into the heart of a brutal war. That opening battle sequence is hands down one of the most intense scenes ever. Although the film is EXTREMELY graphic, it's also a very realistic portrayal of war in general, and it's completely understandable why Spielberg did not hold anything back. He's showing what harrowing hardships those soldiers had to endure, and SPR on all accounts is a respectful tribute to them. Throughout this enthralling story--amazing script written by Robert Rodat by the way--there's elements of hope, cruelty, and friendship that are depicted to their paramount potential in SPR. Although there's a long run time (2 hours 49 minutes) it's an epic scale that Spielberg plays with, and he directs this movie to perfection. Upon finishing this movie, he proved to me once again just why he's the best director of all time (in my opinion at least). And performances are first class all round--Hanks, Damon, Tom Sizemore, Diesel, even Heisenberg himself, Bryan Cranston, made a short appearance and he was great. Every single person brought their A-game, I cannot find any faults in performances. I can't find any faults in SPR in general, everything was top notch, especially the bloody battle sequences. And that ending... Damn, I wish I could spoil it. Honestly, it's still puzzling to me why SPR lost to Shakespeare in Love for Best Picture that year. If you've never seen it, watch it immediately; in my opinion, no other war movie but Inglourious Basterds can go up against SPR, and the former itself was inspired by the latter anyway. SPR is not only one of the best war movies ever made, it's one of the BEST FILMS ever made - 10/10",

These features blew all other movies created in the late nineties out of the water. Without a doubt this movie was revolutionary for the movie industry. \n\tThis films cinematography is some of the greatest for its age with some of the most beautiful settings all over Germany. The scene that recreates D-Day is a perfect example of this with a camera in the place of a soldier in the back of the boat. When that gate fell and the Nazis began to fire leaving the camera with no choice but to jump over the side of the boat with some of the other troops made you feel as though you were in the battle itself. This is not the only time the camera shots do this. Later we are put in the machine gun nests of the Nazis firing upon American troops with an amazing view of Omaha beach. The shots such as these really make you feel like you are fighting and taking part in World War II, which is a major wow factor.\n\tThe cinematography is not the only thing that will have you silent with awe. The special effects for this movie are some of the best ever presented by the movie industry in the late nineties. The amount of realistic blood and gore in this movie makes it feel extremely authentic. There are scenes of soldiers having their limbs blown off and soldiers being shot to death that appears to be so real that you would question if this were real footage from the war itself. This is something \"Saving Private Ryan\" offers compared to most war movies today. These elements make the movie superior to most other war movies out there because the producers were not scared to show what the fighting was actually like which gives you a real vision of World War II.\n\tThe overall acting of this movie was phenomenal for many reasons. Through out the entire movie there will not be a moment where you will believe you are watching Hollywood actors but instead real military personnel. The actors of this movie do an excellent job with earning your heart-felt compassion for their characters. There are scenes where soldiers are in despair and near death begging for their mother's presence holding each other tightly as brothers that really grabs you by the heart. Watching these actors shed real tears together is insane when it comes to the quality of the acting. This movies acting easily beats a good portion of the movies that have come out prior to its release.\n\tSeeing the realism in the costumes, vehicles, and weaponry is another major factor that stands out. It is amazing how well they did with paying attention to detail. The fact that they made sure only the captains had Thompson machine guns showed they had good knowledge while making this movie. It is also astounding how they managed to create so many weapon replicas with such detail and authenticity by showing the ware on the weapons themselves for each soldier in the movie. This is an incredible feat judging on the fact they had over fifty soldiers on screen at one time each wielding their own weapon and having their own costume.\n\tThe movie \"Saving Private Ryan\" without a doubt is one of the greatest films ever created by mankind. It is not just a movie you watch and enjoy; it is an experience you will live with for the rest of your life. This movie is simply a work of art that will stand out among the greatest war films in history.",

It's held up exceptionally well over time, most likely due to the great lengths taken by Spielberg and company to stamp it down in a specific era and remain steadfastly historical. The Normandy beach landing that opens the action is still as powerful and haunting as ever, an effects showcase like none other that puts us right down in the middle of hell itself. I couldn't help but pontificate about the futility of ground warfare here, faced with row after row of doe-eyed teenagers, unceremoniously mowed down before taking so much as a single step on enemy territory. Which is part of its message, no doubt - though that's somewhat countered by the tales of bravado, camaraderie and character that sprawl out over the next two hours. A richly rounded war story, it enjoys a mess of acting performances even stronger than the work of the effects team. Tom Hanks is at the top of the mountain as Captain Miller, a demanding role that he owns from moment one. Supporting faces pop out of the woodwork at every corner; most of us remember Vin Diesel and Adam Goldberg in early roles, but quick shots from Paul Giamatti, Ted Danson, Bryan Cranston and more left my jaw agape. How did I miss spotting these guys the last time? A true epic, profound and moving, with plenty of action but just as much character-building and adventure also in the mix. One of Spielberg's - and Hanks's - best.",

            "content": "It wasn't just bullets and bombs that cleared the way for freedom, but also, and just as crucial to the war effort, the selflessness, courage, honor, and bravery of the men who fought. That selflessness, courage, honor, and bravery was for those in generations later who would view their actions with an understanding of the scale on which these men sacrificed all in the name of liberty and the hope that their descendants would be influenced to lead better lives, to do right by others, to stay true to themselves, and to demonstrate personal valor in all areas of life, in their hearts and souls, words and actions, principles and values. For all the books and memorials and movies, Saving Private Ryan is perhaps the most obvious but also most important tool through which one may see their courage, sacrifice, and purpose to the greater good not only as it applied to the world in 1942, but in the years following the film's release and, if there is any justice in the world, in the decades -- yea centuries and millennia -- to follow. Indeed, Saving Private Ryan is absolutely one of, if not the most, important pictures ever made. It's also quite possibly the best. Compared to those of its genre, perhaps only Glory -- a film that shares with Saving Private Ryan themes on the importance of freedom, respect, courage, and personal sacrifice for the greater good -- may be seen as its equal, and for as many other exceptional War pictures as there are, from All Quiet on the Western Front to Platoon, from Sergeant York to Das Boot, no other quite proves the equal of Saving Private Ryan, not only in terms of the importance of the raw grittiness of violence, but the far more crucial elements of humanity that truly convey what the film and its purpose is all about.",

            "content": "One of the greatest and most extraordinary achievements in filmmaking is Saving Private Ryan. From Academy-Award winning director Steven Spielberg, Saving Private Ryan went on to earn 6 Academy Awards including Spielberg's second win for Best Director. It is considered one of the most unforgettable movies in the history of cinema - mainly for it's unique realistic depiction of WWII combat and it's opening sequence of the D-Day invasion of Omaha Beach which lasted 27 mins. \n\nThe movie contains an overlong running time of 2hrs 49 mins approx. but there's no doubt it was worth it. We see splendid performances from hugely talented actors that were very little known at the time, except Tom Hanks who previously won two Academy Awards and gained an unbelievable career. The guys that steal the show are: Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Vin Diesel, Jeremy Davies and the hugely popular Tom Hanks. They play soldiers from the Battalion Group of the U.S Army who are given the missionary objective to go behind in enemy lines in the hope to seek out and rescue a soldier of the Airborne Division called Private James Ryan who's the last of four brothers. Their doubts of risking their own lives to save another leaves them questioning their mission. \n\nThe audience can be touched by the outstanding performances in this movie, the retelling of the horrors and brutality of war, the script, the directing and the gravity of the movie. What I personally love about the movie is the cinematography technique adapted for it. The angles were just beyond real and we can really look back at WWII like it's the global conflict all over again and that was such an incredibly heartfelt experience. \n\nSpielberg may have just brought to life the movie of his career!",

This is the first film that I would ever consider an experience. The film is almost three hours long but by the time it was over I had forgotten it was a film and not real life. I could go on and on about what's great about this movie, but that would literally take me the entire day. I could tell you what I think is wrong with this movie but I can't do that either because I don't think there is anything wrong this this movie. This is the only film I would consider flawless.

            "content": "\"Saving Private Ryan\" is a masterpiece of cinema from Steven Spielberg, and may be, behind \"The Thin Red Line\" only, the penultimate war film. Even then, as \"The Thin Red Line\" really deconstructs the war film genre, this brutal, visceral and affecting film may stand alone as the truest and best of the genre. Spielberg's directorial hand is stunningly potent in this depiction of the Normandy invasion, sticking to the big-little structure he executes so well, telling the story of a few small individuals amongst titanic events. There is fine acting and a surprisingly restrained script that focuses squarely on the nightmare that was World War II, focusing on creating compassionate empathy and sadness for all involved. The premise may be a bit far fetched, but the themes it explores are historically accurate and universally compelling. What really elevates the film within the genre, however, is it's portrayal of combat. Battlefield brutality has never been given such a balanced and nuanced, yet affecting and visceral depiction. Reminiscent of the best bits of \"A Bridge Too Far,\" Spielberg adeptly films with a \"you are there\" perspective that never descends into shaky cam madness. The violence is revolting and presented to see, while never reaching the gratuitous levels of say, \"Inglorious Basterds\" or \"Fury.\" His technique is nearly flawless, building true terror, horror and tension in classic Spielbergian style (take the drawn out build up to the final battle, the ominous rumbling of approaching German tanks pushing the audience to the limits of anxiety) and breaking new ground in harrowing depictions of violence (the Omaha beach setpiece). Meticulous production and set design aids as well, and the cinematography is flawless, achieving a gritty, yet occasionally ethereal quality. It is fitting that Terrence Malick's war masterpiece, \"The Thin Red Line,\" came out the same year. Both are remarkable films, illuminating the horrors of war, but also the hope of righteousness, in ways that only their respective directors could pull off.\nOn the Spielberg list, this probably comes in third, only behind \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" and \"Schindler's List.\"",

Two other 1998 war movies, The Thin Red Line and When Trumpets Fade, both good movies, are simply put to shame by it. The blood, gore, and sound effects are the most realistic I've seen, the sound effects alone without the video is enough for the movies R rating.  The screaming, pinging, splashing, swearing and rattling are unforgettable. After that the rest of the movie is just as good, the plot is perfect, and with only 9 main characters you get to know them well and get attached to them easily.  Every time one is killed it is really felt, especially the time Medic Wade dies of a shrapnel wound, and Jackson is blown up.  In one particularly brutal and hard to watch scene Mellish and a German soldier fight it out hand to hand, biting and punching each other till a knife is brought out and Mellish is slowly stabbed.  I hate seeing the characters killed, and each death was felt by both me and the movie characters. Anyway the movie was amazing, well done and overall the perfect war movie. Not overly heroic, or romantic, or unbelievable in anyway, and the realistic jokes and humor of some of the characters is well placed and doesn't get in the way of any of the serious stuff. So great movie, problably my second all time favorite movie, and number 1 on my top 15 favorite war movie list. Well done Spielberg!",

It's clear I am obsessed with all things World War 2 & I thought this movie did a brilliant job of capturing just how brutal war is. The D Day opening scene is one of the scenes at the top of my list for most amazing scenes in movies. Handled so well. Spielberg did his research. This movie shows you how devastating, brutal, horrifying & heartbreaking war can be. Shows how brave & loyal men can be. I cry every time lol. Beautiful.

            "content": "*THE OFFICIAL BETTER THAN JUNO SEAL*\n\n\"Maybe saving Private Ryan is the one decent thing we did in this war.\"\n\nSaving Private Ryan is considered by most to be not only the bloodiest war film of all time, but the best war film of all time.  Of course, many naysayers could bring up other great war films, like Full Metal Jacket or Apocalypse Now, but those films have a lower audience score than this by 1%.  However, my personal belief is that this is a good war film, but the best one ever?  Not really.  I mean the dialogue is great and the action is very tense, but those previous films were much better.  Steven Speilberg definitely has a a great sense of vision.  This film is pretty amazing.  I believe this was his last film before he went insane.  I don't need to bring of War of the Worlds or War Horse, do I?  Speilberg is a nice director, though.  He can direct action sequences really well as those were the only decent things in War Horse and WoTW.  Here, he proves he's a master at excellent shots and keeps the film from falling into typical war movie zone (Black Hawk Down)\n\nSaving Private Ryan is the story of Private Ryan, a soldier who lost both his brothers in war.  It is required by law that once all the siblings a soldier has died, that soldier must return home.  So who do they send to do this job?  They send Tom Hanks and his platoon to search for Ryan and bring him home.  Along the way, they encounter many German forces, killing many of the soldiers.  Is the premise anything new or refreshing?  Not really.  It is unique to see what laws are enforced in war, such as something as silly as this, but it's not exactly the best premise ever.  However, the film is pretty well executed and that keeps it going.  Matt Damon stars as Pvt. Ryan, but he isn't in the film until the last 40 minutes.  Tom Hanks stars as the captain and he's basically the main character.  Other people that I recognized in this film were Vin Diesel (Pre-Fast and Furious), Tom Sizemore (That guy that always gets killed in every war movie made), Adam Goldberg (That Jewish guy from Zodiac), Bryan Cranston (Walter White from Breaking Bad), and Nathan Fillion in a short scene as the wrong Ryan.  Don't believe that Fillion was in the movie?  Rewatch it.  \n\nThe film is amazingly shot.  The iconic opening sequence recreating the battle for Normandy was intense and sad at the very same time.  Spielberg held nothing back as bodies were being torn to shreds left and right.  No horror film could ever measure up to the chilling sight when Tom Hanks sees he's fellow soldiers' bodies floating in the ocean.  And speaking about Hanks, this guy can act.  So much so, that the previous statement possibly would undermine his talent.  He's proven here that once again, he's one of the best.  I cannot compliment his acting anymore.  It's a shame that he had to go to Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close for another paycheck.  Oh well.\n\nAgain, there are things holding this film back.  At times, the film can feel overly patriotic.  So much so, that it can be overbearing in some scenes.  Also,  there is this annoying character who lets *SPOILER* Adam Goldberg's character to die and does nothing about it. *SPOILER DONE*  He then is crying like a bitch.  It doesn't help that there are many scenes with him in it.  Also, he doesn't even die.  I mean, I don't want the guy to.  But if you have no backbone, you shouldn't sign up for war and possibly get more comrades killed.  Actually, he was the reason for the entire battle at the end.  So, I really hate that guy.  Also, while the film holds nothing back, it can get a little to gratuitous at times.  I mean, yeah, war is probably as gory as this, but seeing a man explode while trying to plant a bomb and showing everything is a little too much.  I don't have a weak stomach, but yeah, was some of the deaths shown necessary?  Then, there's the fact that the battle scenes stretch out to 20 minutes at a time.  It can get rather boring at a time.  \n\nOverall, Saving Private Ryan may not be the savior of war films as I wanted it to be, but it's a damn good one.  That's for sure.  At times, the violence seemed to be violent just for the sake of being......violent.  The action scenes stretch out to incredible lengths and at times, I kind of wanted to see it end already.  However, this film is nicely shot and has some amazing dialogue.  It's definitely not forgettable and that shows that Spielberg and co. did their job well.  It's a nice look into the struggles that occurred during World War II and should be a warning to everyone that these wars were no joke.  Tom Hanks stole the show as the Captain.  This guy can act.  I may not have liked some of his critically acclaimed films like Cast Away as much as I should, but he's a great actor.  He makes it look so easy.  Originally, I was planning on giving this film a 7/10.  However, watching Nathan Fillion crying boosted this film up to an 8/10.  So, yeah, that scene helped a lot.  \n\n8/10",

John Miller in a dynamic and breath-taking way. Leading his men on a mission to find a missing private who is set to be sent home after his three brothers have been killed, Miller (Hanks) fights his way through questioning GIs and approaching dangers, in set piece after memorable set piece, revealing more and more about a war over seven decades ago. Every actor plays their part wonderfully, bringing the camaraderie of war to never heights, and opening the door for mini-series like \"Band Of Brothers\". The writing, especially in dialogue, helps develop this enormous cast of characters in one of the most natural and impressive feats in screenwriting history. Spielberg and his cinematographer encapsulate the unease and unforgiving nature of war and with beautiful landscapes and constant close-ups of the characters, the film will never lose it's antiquity, standing the test of time over decades to come. One of the most memorable achievements in film-making history, to take on the gigantic task of producing this epic for the screen is enough to place Spielberg in the annals of best director of all-time, even on top of his already outstanding work. Never before and not since has there been a more entertaining and thoughtful representation of the war and for that \"Saving Private Ryan\" remains one of my all-time favorite films and one of the best ever made.",

Spielberg perfectly directs Rober Rodat's screenplay with a huge sense of realism, grit, and graphic violence to make this the best and most realistic war film ever made.  The film benefits from amazing visual effects, realistic battle scenes, as well as great acting and execution.  The best thing to come from this film is the character development, the chemistry between the characters, and mostly, the emotional impact it has on the characters and their collaboration with the other characters.  The film has incredible graphic violence that pushes and challenges the MPAA's restrictions on films, and add realism to the film.  The film offers great humor at times, as well as the effect of war on family and friends of the characters.  A Spielberg film that's hard to stand with the graphic violence, but watchable and enjoyable for its themes and characterization.",

            "content": "War movies...they affect us all.  War is probably one of the most influential aspects of mankind, shaping cultures and civilizations for thousands of years, both amazing and horrifying people.  And nothing can compare in immensity and overall affecting might to the Second World War.  One of the most costly conflicts in human history, it has shaped the entire turning of the world ever since.  And of course, there have been absolutely tons of films, shows, miniseries, and books about this war.  Two of the best \"oldie\" war films that portrayed this conflict have to be The Longest Day (1962) and Patton (1970), both which give great, if not rather differing, deliveries.  And there are two miniseries that I absolutely love about WW2, both Spielberg/Hanks productions: Band of Brothers (2001) and The Pacific (2010).  These are in my opinion the two greatest miniseries of all time, substantially different yet still having a brutal and realistic feel to both.  Not a single episode in either is genuinely BAD per se, in fact all are incredibly good, and they have some of the best acting, action, visuals, and true story basis you can find in entertainment.\n\nNow...that's probably not why you're reading this.  You're here to see what my favorite war movie of all time is.  And...I really don't want to seem unoriginal because I'm NOT the only person to think this, but...Saving Private Ryan, from 1998 directed by the great Steven Spielberg, is truly my favorite of his films and the best war movie out there.  There are some that say this film isn't something Spielberg usually does...well in that case those people need to see Schindler's List.  Others say it glorifies war, makes it seem promising and entertaining.  Well...look at the first 24 minutes of the film and tell me that glorifies war.  How many \"glorifying of war\" films will have soldiers lying with their intestines spilling out, crying for their mother? How many \"glorifying of war\" films will begin waving an American flag that in fact seems so unnatural and dull that it's clearly trying to be a visual symbol of the horrors of war? But anyway, let's get on with the review.\n\nFirstly, I want to say that Tom Hanks was probably the greatest choice for the lead role that could have been chosen, and with such a massive lineup of great movies to his name, this is actually the one with his best performance.  And with such great performances as in movies like Big, Philadelphia, Forrest Gump, the Toy Story films, Apollo 13, and Cast Away to name but a few...that's saying something.\n\nSecond: One of the things that makes Saving Private Ryan so great is how it just makes even the smallest details unforgettable.  Like a splash of water when a body falls, or when that one M1 carbine is dropped and spins through the air, or the still unforgotten clattering of the German machine guns as the invaders attempt to storm the beaches of Normandy.  Truly Spielberg, who has made both goods and bads in his long and still going career, put more effort and care into this film than anything he has ever done before.\n\nThird: The film is so intense, so personal, so filled with distinctions, that one must have their entire bodily functions set on it.  You literally can't do anything but watch it.  Full attention must be utilized, because there is just so much in this movie that honestly, if there's any flaw in it, it should have been longer.  But there are still things that really keep you surprised.  For example, and I'm absolutely sure I'm not the first to point this out, one would think it was Capt. Miller as the old man kneeling in the graveyard in the beginning of the film.  But no, he dies.  And it's actually a very good twist to realize it's Matt Damon's character, the Private Ryan of the film's title, who was in the beginning.\n\nSo yeah...Saving Private Ryan manages to be both a realistic and no-holding-back war film of epic proportions, yet also touching without forcing it down your throat like Spielberg has done in the past...or is it future...never mind.  But one thing bugs me...former president George W. Bush, whom I personally consider the worst president we've ever had (well Cheney would have been a hell of a lot worse), apparently considers this his favorite movie.  I'll repeat that: The president who decided to invade Afghanistan due to an assumption that was not properly researched, and to invade Iraq under the pretense of hidden weapons, fought this brutally violent film that still manages to make us understand that war IS bad...thinks this is his favorite movie? Well, somebody clearly has no idea what Saving Private Ryan is really about.",

            "content": "Brotherhood is worth dying for\n\nSaving Private Ryan is about a band of brothers who give up their own lives to save the life of a single soldier in the chaos of war. The Controlling Idea, that brotherhood is worth dying for, is well told and thematically supported. The contradictory notion of risking the lives of many to save the few resonates well with the idea of war in general: that the values of freedom, family and human rights are ideals worth dying for: even if these values are preserved only for a few survivors. The hope is the survivors (and the viewers) can go on to live a good life and treasure their freedoms that others died to protect. The question is that in a democracy where human rights and freedoms are valued, why would anyone in their right mind choose to sacrifice their life and limb? The answer: these soldiers choose to do it to protect a brother, and these armies choose to do it to protect the basic human rights of the citizens of fellow nations. This seems to suggest that the very fabric of democratic society rests on the fundamental respect for each other and the rights of others and that these rights and freedoms are ideals that much be protected to the death.\n\nGreat film told with what I count to be three major external plots: to save Ryan, to win the war and to save the lives of the men. The lives of the men are lost to achieve the first two. Thus proving the Controlling Idea that brotherhood is worth dying for.\n\nMy major complaint is the film is too long. Three hours is a long time and the episodes of peace are not so interesting since not much relationship or personal development takes place. The brothers are \"good\" from beginning to end and their relationships are \"good\" from beginning to end. Of course there are minor plotlines like Opum's compassion for POWs and Reiben's questioning of Miller's judgement. But they don't create serious turning points in an otherwise external-action focused story. I think the story would look substantially the same if you cut out the middle: the Carparso dying to save a French child, the radar assault that loses Wade and the church resting.\n\nhttp://www.storycharts.ca/story/5105650963054592/5079606281371648/Film/Saving_Private_Ryan",

            "content": "This review contains spoilers.\r\n\r\nSaving Private Ryan is one of the best war films ever made, and is in my top ten of the genre, right alongside Full Metal Jacket and The Great Escape. It's an enrapturing film; I tried to eat dinner while watching it and found that I couldn't do it-- the movie demanded my full attention. \r\n\r\nSteven Spielberg once again proves himself to be the unchallenged master of yanking the old heartstrings at the movies, but instead of falling into the sappy, dreary pitfalls that plagued War Horse, he directs this film with care and grace. The battle scene at the beginning, a good twenty minutes of horrific images, would have been dull and listless in the hands of a lesser director, but Spielberg makes it work with his classic attention to detail and memorable camera angles. A scene in which Tom Hanks falls into the water and sees fellow soldiers being torn to bits by bullets under the surface is particularly notable.\r\n\r\nAnd speaking of Tom Hanks, holy SHIT can this guy act. It's already been proven that Hanks has the range that most actors only dream of, and he's proven himself to be one of the best actors of our generation with Forrest Gump and Cast Away. But this is possibly his greatest performance yet. Hanks plays an English teacher hopelessly entrenched in the war. It's remarkable how well the writers knew their audience-- I didn't think for a second that Hanks could play a bloodthirsty soldier-- but he sure makes it work. \r\n\r\nThere are a few flaws, however, that keep me from giving this film the full 10/10. Yeah, I know, I'm too hard on movies, but I just gave Brick the full 10, so that's it for the year. Firstly, the basic concept of the film, this company being sent out to save one man trapped behind enemy lines, is less than plausible. Yes, it's happened before in real life (I refer you to Black Hawk Down), but the issue is brought up by the characters in this film so often that it makes you wonder why they even set out to do it. Sure, all of Ryan's brothers were killed. That wouldn't justify sending twelve guys out into enemy territory to scoop him up and bring him back home to mommy.\r\n\r\nAlso, one character (played by Adam Goldberg) is so relentlessly bitchy about his role in the war that it makes one pause for a second to wonder how he made it into the army in the first place. He lets two of his fellow soldiers die while he sits on the stairs of a building weeping. It's pathetic. And again, I get what it was trying to do. Spielberg wanted to show that war can break anyone-- but as he tends to do, he takes it a little over the top. In the final scene, less time is devoted to Hanks and Damon (the main characters) than to Goldberg whining. \r\n\r\nIt's still a great film, though, one of the greatest ever made. In the beginning, we see an old man fall to his knees in front of a grave in the present day. We assume him to be Tom Hanks, because as soon as he looks up, the film cuts to Hanks storming the beaches of Normandy. But when Hanks dies at the end (in one of the most well-handled dramatic moments in any war film), we realize that the old man is actually Private Ryan himself. And looking back, he does look a bit like Matt Damon. It's little things like that that keep the audience on their toes throughout the film.\r\n\r\nAs I said before, the dialogue is great and never ventures into canned and sappy territory, which I despise with a passion (just read my reviews of War Horse and Up). Although Hanks's death scene is moving and powerful, it doesn't make the discerning viewer throw up their hands in exasperation and exclaim \"Great, more typical Speilberg shit!\" It's tense, tight, and action-packed. Final Score for Saving Private Ryan: 9/10 stars. It's one of the best films Spielberg ever made before he became a money-grabbing android.\r\n\r\nOh, and as an aside-- I think it's an argument for gays in the military too. Because it wouldn't take long for twelve gay guys to locate Matt Damon.",

            "content": "Saving Private Ryan is the best Second World War movie ever made.\n\nThe good. Almost everything could be listed here as exceptional, but I'll just mention what really makes this a master piece. First and foremost, the fighting and how it's depicted. You feel the same stress, terror, and confusion as the soldiers. There are some heroics, but it's normal man heroics. Men die by the score, there's no favorites. It's dirty, it's loud, it's dangerous, it's inhumane. Beyond that, you've got an incredibly compelling story, amazing photography, a rich scenario, very attaching and real characters, as well as interesting thoughtful dialogs.\n\nThe actors. There are so many excellent ones, and a number that were on the cusp of their stardom. Tom Hanks is of course in one of his best incarnation ever. Tom Sizemore is the perfect solid loyal sergent. Paul Giamatti has a small role, but without contest one of his best by playing his normal edgy style in a war context with a thin veneer of authority and calm. Edward Burns is just right as the loud mouth New Yorker. And you cheer Barry Pepper as the God blessed sniper. Now for a few surprises. Giovanni Ribisi, playing a bit far from his usual role, is excellent as the overwhelmed caring medic. Dennis Farina, which I normally do not like, is a stoic senior officer with an calm aura. You can also see a young Nathan Fillion in a quick cameo. Here, one might argue wether Matt Damon was given a large role or not, but he did carry it out well, if a bit subpar for him. However, the truly big surprise is the appearance of Vin Diesel playing something completely out of his usual affectations with credible results.\n\nThe bad. It's a near perfect film, but there's one thing that irked me. The family of the veteran was either badly chosen of badly directed. When he starts to cry they all act as if it was a big surprise. Really? What did you think he was going to do?\n\nThe ugly. Nothing.\n\nThe result. Be ready for some tough bloody scenes, and you'll love this realistic representation of war.",

            "content": "When Steven Spielberg was finally handed a long overdue Oscar in 1993, he received it for tackling the harrowing genocides of World War II in \"Schindler's List\". So far, he's only received two Best Director Awards and the other was fittingly received when he tackled the battlefields of that very same war in \"Saving Private Ryan\". Two different film's but equally as powerful as the other.\n During WWII, Chief of staff General Marshall (Harve Presnell) is informed of the death of three brothers in different conflicts and that their mother will receive the telegrams at the same time. A fourth brother, Private James Ryan (Matt Damon) is believed to be still alive, somewhere in the French countryside, and the decision is taken to locate him. Captain Miller (Tom Hanks), is given the rescue mission of leading his 2nd Ranger battalion through Nazi occupied territory to find Ryan and send him home.\n Spielberg is, quite simply, one of the finest filmmakers that has ever graced the craft. He is, and will continue to be, heralded throughout generations of audiences and that's with very good reason, as he's instilled a sense of awe and unadulterated entertainment for over 40 years now. Despite an impressive backlog of movies that consists of such classics like \"Jaws\", \"Close Encounters...\", \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" and \"E.T\", the opening 25 minutes of \"Saving Private Ryan\" - where he thrusts us into the 1944 D-Day landings of Omaha Beach -  is arguably his most impressive and certainly his most visceral work. It's absolutely exhausting in it's construction and sense of realism and the realisation soon sets in, that this cinematic autuer is not about to pull any punches in portraying a time in history that's very close to his heart. The opening is so commanding that some have criticised the film for not living up this grand and devastating scale but Spielberg has many more up his sleeve. He's just not able to deliver them too close together -  otherwise, the film would be absolutely shattering and very difficult to get through. To bridge the gap between breathtaking battles scenes the film falls into a rather conventional storyline about men on a mission but it's only purpose is to keep the film flowing and allows Spielberg the ability to make the brutality of war more personal. Two scenes in particular, are as overwhelming as the opening to the film: the hand-to-hand combat between a German soldier and Private Mellish (played by Adam Goldberg) and the deeply emotional and ironic injuries of T-4 Medic Wade (played by Giovanni Ribisi). These moments in the film are the most difficult to watch but they only really work because we are allowed the time to bond with the characters beforehand and experience the combat with them. Each of them have a particular but very different appeal, making it harder to accept when some of them perish in savage and harrowing circumstances.\n The cast also deserve the utmost praise for making the roles their own; the always reliable Hanks is solid in the central role and there are exceptional performances from the first rate support, namely, Barry Pepper and the aforementioned Goldberg and Ribisi, who are all outstanding.\nJanusz Kaminski's magnificent cinematography is also starkly delivered; his images are both beautifully and horrifically captured and Spielberg's decision to desaturate the colour and adopt some handheld approaches, add an authenticity that's rarely been captured in the genre and brings another dimension to some of the finest and most realistic battle scenes ever committed to the screen.\n There's not much in the way of criticism that I can throw at this near masterpiece, other than Robert Rodat's script; the conventional plot strays into cliche where the Germans are completely stereotypical and there is absolutely no sign of an Allied soldier anywhere. Rodat would have you believe that America fought the war singlehandedly, but despite these discrepancies, the film has so much power that these faults can be overlooked.\n One of the darkest chapters in our history is viscerally captured in a raw and uncompromising piece of work from a virtuoso director, tapping into the highest of his abilities. Some may prefer the more fantastical and escapist nature of Spielberg, but for me, this is the finest film he's made.\n\nMark Walker",

For one it's a World War II film, has a great filmmaker Steven Spielberg, and great actor Tom Hanks. But would I have been ready for this? Definitely not. Nope.\nSteven Spielberg brings us probably the most gritty war film ever that completely changed the game of films in that genre and how we see war films today. Think about it, when you see a trailer for a upcoming war film I'm pretty sure you wonder if it'll be like Saving Private Ryan, or perhaps Black Hawk Down.\nAnyway, film starts off with the famous Normandy invasion of June 6th, 1944 and it lasts for about 20 minutes and some change. It's insane. And the film only gets better from there. \nTom Hanks plays a captain of a squad looming for Private James Ryan played by Matt Damon and they play there roles fine, as everyone else too. Great film that makes you feel for them and get to know the characters and the ones that do die you feel sorry and sadness for them. \nGood movie, recommend it to anyone, but don't watch it with your kids. Pretty sure they'd be scared and wouldn't know what the hell is happening to the screen.",

They are totally unnecessary to the plot of the film and hokey as all get out.\n\tOtherwise all of the narrative which takes place during World War II is sensational.\n\tSure the scene where they storm the beaches on D-Day is a marvelous sight to behold, but don't let that detract from the scenes that follow. It's all good stuff.\n\tTom Hanks leads a cast of fantastic characters including Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore, Vin Diesel, Adam Goldberg, Giovanni Ribisi, Jeremy Davies, Barry Pepper, Matt Damon, Dennis Farina, Ted Danson, Brian Cranston and Paul Giamatti.\n\tAll deliver exceptional performances throughout.\n\tIf you've been keeping SPR in the back pocket like me, let it out anytime.\n        You'll enjoy this film.\n        But stop reading here, I'm going to spoil a few things.\n        Vin Diesel is very good in this movie, and it gets a little dusty when his character dies, but it seems like there is some ADR (additional dialogue recording) shoved into the scene directly preceding.\n        The only portion of the movie that may ruin the suspension of disbelief is here, when Vin takes the daughter. The scene is a bit unbelievable, it only lasts a second, but something is lost to the viewer. I think the ADR might be part of the reason.\n        Speaking of, when he's laying there and takes out the note for his father, I'm almost certain there is ADR because his lines do not match up with his lips or body language.\n        Anyway, if I were to criticize that scene, I'd be nitpicking. It still gets dusty no matter what he's saying.\n        To address my earlier criticism, you might argue that the 'bookends' (the scenes in which we see Matt Damon all grown up, having fathered at least two generations) are necessary to provide redemption to the deceased characters.\n        This is a fair point, but I don't think we need this kind of handholding. I don't believe anyone would have wondered whether or not he went on to father children. Almost all of the characters are heroic (especially Private Ryan) and we know that he's alive at the end of their mission.\n        They are required to give him another chance, and that's made apparent by his survival during the film's climax. The viewer can presume he will make the best of the life they've sacrificed for.\n\tBut this is all semantics. Leave the scenes in, for all I care.\n\tSaving Private Ryan is a fantastic movie.",

Since all three of his brothers are dead their mission is to find him and send the private home . Despite the dangers and the subsequent deaths of many comrades, they finally complete their mission after one last heroic fight. The movie flashes forward to the present day Ryan as he kneels at the graves of those brave men who saved him. Unsure he asks his wife if he lived a good life because those soldiers payed the ultimate price for him.

This has the greatest effects of all time. the greatest effects are not in fantasy things like Avatar, but in realistic things like this. \n\nThe opening scene I was not fully prepared for. I sat down and started watching this eating a bowl of ice cream, and I was stunned by the opening scene that I had to stop eating until about 10 minutes after it was done. But man what an unbelievable scene. So real, so intense, and I felt like I could picture myself out there. \n\nThe final battle was even more intense then the first one. I was so amazed by everything in this film. Spielberg is my favorite film director, not only because he makes great movies, but because his films are epic. \n\nThe acting in this film made the battle scenes even more convincing. Like the scene when the guy gets shot in the stomach, and you see him shaking, and then he asks for morphine. I just felt like this film was just so real. \n\nI believe that Spielberg has two types of films. The historical ones like \"Schindlers List,\" then there are the more adventurous and more special effect oriented ones like \"Jaws,\" \"Jurassic Park.\" This film falls into both categories. Spielberg just never fails as a director it amazes me. This is also just another great film in Tom Hanks filmography.",

Miller and seven other soldiers (Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Adam Goldberg, and Jeremy Davies) as they search for a paratrooper, Private First Class James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), who is the last-surviving brother of four servicemen.\n\n        The first thing you notice when you are watching Saving Private Ryan is the booming big band backing music written by possibly the best in the business, John Williams; whose music somehow dramatizes the fabulous action sequences even more than they already are. \n\n        The brilliantly realistic and rather gruesome and bloody portrayal of war is what makes Saving Private Ryan is what makes this epic war film, starring Tom Hanks, Giovanni Ribisi, Vin Diesel, Matt Damon, Barry Pepper and Jeremy Davies, who, along with Hanks, delivers a near perfect performance, a big hit.\n\n        On the other hand, the violence and the performances are the only positives about this film.  Because the plot sort of goes AWOL; as the search for Private Ryan ends with an hour remaining.  The last hour is mostly dialogue relating to pre-war experiences that, whilst it makes viewers realize how isolated the war was, in my opinion just isn\u00e2(TM)t needed. \n\n        Yet nonetheless you will forget the lousiness of the extended period of talking almost the moment it ends, as a rather extended battle scene unfolds.  And, by the way, this is a battle that will undoubtedly re-quench your thirst for blood and Nazi ass-kicking after the incredibly heart-pounding, gruesome and sadly accurate assault on Omaha Beach.\n\n        However while the particularly accurate and horrifying action is a plus, what really makes this film is the truly magnificent performance from the majority of the cast.  Hanks single-handedly takes this film from a bloody war film to an emotional war epic, Jeremy Davies, who portrays cartographer Timothy Upham, delivers an astounding performance littered with tears and shaking hands, Giovanni Ribisi plays medic Irwin Wade, who performs fabulously, especially after being shot and many others perform marvellously\n\n        Ultimately Saving Private Ryan is an emotional war epic that delivers a stunningly accurate portrayal of war, which is bloody and gruesome, and is lifted immensely high by performances that truly make you feel sorry for the characters.",

The blood and gore appears with no apologies; it is a difficult film to sit through, but very powerful at the same time.  The captain's platoon is presented with well crafted and diverse characters. Each character has his own depth. There are no contrived moments. The film provides a realistic depiction of the struggles that the characters would go through in terms of emotions and morality. A unique achievement of WWII's D-day invasion of Normandy that I cannot conceive being surpassed.",

            "content": "This is my second favorite World War II movie after Schindler\u00e2(TM)s List, which was also made by Steven Spielberg. Saving Private Ryan is captivating and also shows the whole events that war carries, the movie is well acclaimed for its graphic realistic depiction of World War II; since I wasn\u00e2(TM)t there during it, if this is what war looks like\u00e2\u00a6, I pray to God that there is no World War III.\n\nThe movie is about a United States Army Rangers Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks) and seven other soldiers under him as they search for a paratrooper, Private First Class James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), who is the last-surviving brother of four servicemen and has been ordered by the President to be brought home as his family fears losing all five sons to the war.\n\nThere is just one thing about this movie that cut my attention, after Hanks character Captain John H. Miller, drags he crew through the war losing many on their way in crude ways all in the name of finding Private Ryan, they finally found him and Ryan refuses to go back with them, claiming he doesn\u00e2(TM)t need saving.\nMiller and the remaining of his crew then joins Ryan\u00e2(TM)s course. If I was Miller I would have knocked him (Ryan) up the head and drag him home.\n\nSaving Private Ryan is a War Epic film, done by Steven Spielberg, who has been involved in some World War II films before this, like Empire of the Sun and Schindler's List. To prep the guys for the film the cast except from Matt Damon were sent to a ten days \"boot camp\" for training and work on the film set to prepare them for their roles. The reason Damon was excluded was for the other cast to develop a form of resentment towards him, which will help in their reaction to him during filming.\n\nCritically noted for its portrayal of World War II, this film was released to a high positive acceptance and earned a whooping 11 nominations in the Academy Awards, going home with just 5, including winning Spielberg his second Academy Award as a director. The movies cinematography too has to be praised the movie shots during the world War II fight on Omaha beach is a classic to see, that scene has been noted as one of the greatest TV scenes of all time.\n\nSaving Private Ryan was also a commercial success, making more than 6 times its 70 million production cost and its home video sale was massive.\n\nThis is a movie that I can bet my name on that you will enjoy, the depiction of the war sequence the sad end to lives during the war, the repercussion of cowardly behavior all added to the drama and the fun you will get while watching this war classic.\n\nwww.lagsreviews.com",
