In decades past it would've been like a 78 out of 100 type grade (like a normal, fun, testosterone-filled, summer blockbuster) but I think the recent heavy-handed nature of Hollywood's political & social themes that incessantly gets injected into scripts...I think that climate subconsciously might make viewers feel refreshed after seeing a movie like this. The political topics you expect to be forcefully injected into the script or the social themes you expect to be forcefully projected onto the main characters, aren't there. It's literally the definition of K.I.S.S. ('keep it simple stupid'). Thus had it been made in 1960's - 2000s, we'd consider it average to above average summer blockbuster. Because it's made in 2022 however, I find myself giving it credit for the things it doesn't do more so than the things it does. Worth a watch especially for older male audiences.",

If you lived through the 90's and know what an actual movie is suppose to be like, then you may be disappointed.

It does not promote war, but instead shows the importance of having a strong defense, as history does repeat itself. Because of individuals who are willing to defend our country, at the risk of their own lives, America is not ending but is continuing to fight for democracy.

Peter \"Maverick\" Mitchell (Tom Cruise) has remained a \"captain\" in the 35 or so years since the action of the original movie while his contemporaries had moved on to bigger (and more bureaucratic) positions. This movie is a throwback in all the right ways. At first, the \"danger zone\" opening got me going, but I had concerns that the sequel would rely heavily on nostalgia without providing much of a story \u2014 these concerns were quickly assuaged. In fact, instead of going back to 1986, we are set into hyperdrive into the future as Maverick test-flies a plane for his pioneered \"Darkstar\" program, which continues with manhandled flight instead of the transition to drones. Besides this scene just being beautiful, it sets the tone for the movie that provides a blend of classic military competition (both in the air and shirtless ball-playing on the beach), a well-paced \u2014 but not overbearing \u2014 love story, and practical effects action. I was surprised, however, that the plane doesn't make a reappearance. \"Hangman\" (Glen Powell) is a \"villain\" straight out of a 1980s teen ski movie and antagonist to \"Rooster\" (Miles Teller), \"Goose's\" son who provides the motivation for Maverick throughout the story. The nameless, faceless villain is back and of course, I have the knee-jerk reaction of questioning why we're just bombing a sovereign nation, but that's not what this story is about. Top Gun is and always has been an isolated story of one school, one program, one class. Upon reflection, I didn't need the larger geopolitics \u2014 I also very much appreciated that they kept the \"controversial\" Taiwan patch on Maverick's jacket. Top Gun: Maverick is the type of cinematic experience I just don't get from Marvel movies or Avatar and I couldn't be happier that this sort of movie still exists.",

Miles Teller's character pays homage to his father by playing Great Balls of Fire on the piano on the beach. Val Kilmer reprising his role is absolutely epic. Sweaty aviators playing beach sports together. They've even got a pretty dope soundtrack, just like the first Top Gun.\n\nThere are also some nice updates for the modern era. There are female pilots for example. And Maverick realizes that it's not cool to be a total dick to women anymore. Like, they have feelings and families. Not really a thing in the 80s.\n\nUnfortunately, Meg Ryan had to step aside to make space for a new story, a decision I didn't want, but ultimately think was the right call.\n\nI didn't want to like this movie as much as I did, but it's nearly perfect.

Everybody pulled their weight and played their character properly that by the end of the the movie, I have to say that I liked every character in the movie.\nStory wise, having Mav still dealing with the loss of Goose and also being a step in father figure and teacher to Rooster (Goose's son) is an odd yet very welcomed changed to the tone of the movie compared to the first.  Furthermore, having the Navy going against a \"faceless\" enemy is a smart thing to do as it provides good tension to the story.  The romance is much better handled this time round with a much more respectful Mav towards woman, and no cringy unnecessary sex scenes.\nMusic-wise, excellent compositions and song from Zimmer, Gaga and Faltermeyer.  One Republic's mid movie song is an absolute bop.\nThe cinematography and editing is on point.  Having the pilots being in actual plains and shooting a fighter jet from another jet, really made every shot breathtaking to watch on an IMax screen.  There's barely any CG to break the immersion of the story because the planes were really flying in the sky, and explosions for the most part are practically made.  \n\nOverall, this is an absolute must watch and Blu-Ray purchase.  Hollywood needs to know that these are the types of movies that people want to watch.  No offense to the MCU (I love the MCU),  superhero movies just don't have the charm of what movies like Top Gun can offer.

After more than 30 years, due to the will of a dying \"Iceman\" (the performance of Val Kilmer is very touching), now admiral of the navy, test pilot Dave Mitchell is transferred to the Top Gun division with the goal to train a team that has to destroy an uranium enrichment plant; among these young pilots Cruise finds Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw (Miles Teller), son of his close friend and RIO \"Goose\"; moreover, in the old bar near the base, he meets one of his old flames, Penny Benjamin (Jennifer Connelly). A film critic once said that one clich\u00e9 is ridiculous, one hundred all togheter makes you cry.

It's a blast and one that perhaps only someone like Tom Cruise could deliver with his ridiculous work ethic and innate understanding of what audiences want. It's exciting, spectacular and a whole heap of unashamed fun. If it glorifies the military-industrial complex too much, then some of us may need to remember that it's possible to enjoy a piece of art for what it is and not buy into its undergirding principles.

            "content": "Top Gun: Maverick is an impressive summer blockbuster, and not just for the reasons you'd think. Are the high-flying, vertigo-inducing plane scenes a thrill to behold? Yes; simply stunning and shot in a way that truthfully makes you feel as if you're in the cockpit. These scenes are numerous throughout the film and really form the basis for devouring this popcorn movie. Outside of the planes though the story can get threadbare and forced. The main plot involves Maverick training new Top Guns to destroy an unmarked uranium processing plant in an unnamed country using tactics loudly reminiscent of The Death Star trench run including having to fit a missile into a missile-sized hole. Some might say the hole isn't much bigger than a womp rat. Anyways, the out-of-cockpit stuff meanders, but Tom Cruise's devil-may-care demeanor helps sell the package and this is the other main reason why Top Gun: Maverick is so impressive. The entire plot is built on top of a landfill of clich\u00e9s, but somehow it works and the film might even be better for it. One of Maverick's students happens to be Goose's son (Miles Teller as Rooster), inevitable conflict emerges. Maverick bumps into his old flame Penny (played by Jennifer Connelly) and while the film would like us to believe that it was happenstance it can't sell that conclusion very well. The rest of Maverick's class of Top Guns might as well be faceless they're so paper-thin. It all culminates almost exactly the way you think it will and still it was a joy. It's a strange film that shouldn't work, and occasionally it doesn't albeit briefly, but largely does due to its willingness to lean into the fun campiness of a summer action film despite costing something in predictability. This is a risky gambit, expecting people to know what they want is historically a fool's errand. But Cruise and company pull it off with this exciting blockbuster that's worth going to the theater to see.",

I liked the sentimentality element but I didn't like some of the casting particularly Miles Teller. I saw him as a bad guy in a couple of movies.

The story is shambolic and if it got released nowadays it would be as the young chaps say 'cancelled'. This film sent me to hospital and I am writing this review from a mental asylum. I would not recommend watching this film. Even as the title, 'Freddy got Fingered', suggests this film is a disgrace to humanity and makes you feel sick inside.",

It wildly surpasses its predecessor in terms of plot and, obviously, visual effects. Quite an enjoyable ride, in which the flying sequences are astounding and breathtaking. This one is even more technical and more accurate, but boring is never an adjective that could describe this film, given its thrilling spectacle. The nostalgia is there, but it tells an original story that adds depth to what had already been established. It is also very satisfying to see the main character evolve and overcome his problems in an epic way. Huge shout-out to the extraordinary theme song 'Hold my Hand' written and performed by Lady Gaga'. Also, 60-year-old Tom Cruise is a legend!!!!",

There was a scene where Cruise had his shirt off on the beach, there was a sex scene. There was even a vintage Porsche, oh and a local bar.  I just thought REALLY?  They even had someone playing 'Great Balls of Fire' at the piano.  The first movie was great. The second was a complete copycat.  \n\nThe storyline in the end was fun, and there was suspense, and Maverick vs. The Military.  There was also some emotional turmoil which helped the plot. It was not a five, because it felt remade, but it was still fun and exciting.  Tom Cruise looks pretty darn good still after all these years.  He has certainly aged better than I have.",

Ordered to train a group of young pilots for an almost impossible mission, he is still as cocky as ever as he attempts to unite them as a team, despite arising complication from his past that need to be reconciled. The slick film has adrenaline-filled action, but also heart, particularly in its handling of Van Kilmer's appearance as Maverick's former nemesis, Iceman. Its pacing keeps your attention in the way that old-school stories used to, with an engaging narrative and solid performances that make seeing it at the cinema a real experience. The call-backs to the original movie are great, but it also stands on its own merit as a very entertaining film, especially in its exciting flying sequences.",

            "content": "Top Gun: Maverick is my all-time favorite film, and I have watched it numerous times in theaters. The film is a thrilling and emotionally powerful story about Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell (Tom Cruise), who is tasked with training (and later leading) a group of TOPGUN graduates to strike a uranium enrichment plant in a foreign country. One of the graduates is Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw (Miles Teller), who is the son of Maverick's best friend, Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw, who died. Maverick's conflict with Rooster gradually escalates throughout the film.\n\nMaverick has guilt and feels responsible for Goose's death, and this is a central theme throughout the film. His relationship with Penny Benjamin (played by Jennifer Connelly) is pivotal to both of their character arcs as he begins to treat her with more respect and consideration rather than just engaging in casual encounters. Tom Cruise delivers an impressive performance in a scene where Maverick visits Iceman (Val Kilmer) at his house and is torn over whether or not to send Rooster on a risky mission. Maverick is conflicted because if he sends Rooster, he may not come back alive, but if he doesn't send him, Rooster will never forgive him for pulling his naval academy papers and not believing he can fly the mission.\n\nThe final battle in the film borrows the concept of the final battle from the first Star Wars film and showcases the strong bond between Maverick and Rooster as they work together to take down enemy jets. They use their skills and determination to complete their mission and emerge victorious. The practical filmmaking techniques used in the film add to the sense of realism, making the film an immersive and engaging experience. The score, composed by Hans Zimmer, Lorne Balfe, and Harold Faltemeyer, adds to the excitement with its intense and thrilling pieces of music.\n\nOverall, Top Gun: Maverick is a well-acted, emotionally powerful film with exciting action scenes and a thrilling score. The themes of personal conflict and overcoming guilt are explored in a nuanced and complex way, and the characters of Maverick and Rooster are fully fleshed out and compelling. This movie is not just for fans of action films, but for everyone who enjoys well-crafted storytelling with emotional depth and complex character development. With its inspiring message of overcoming personal challenges and trusting in your instincts, Top Gun: Maverick is my all-time favorite film and one that will leave you feeling uplifted and motivated. If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend giving it a watch.",

In the original Tom Cruise played 'Maverick', a hotshot young Naval pilot at the Top Gun Academy. In the time since he has never risen above the rank of Captain, preferring to keep flying and not be in command of anything. In this sequel he is called back to teach a bunch of new young pilots on how to take on a very dangerous mission. There's not a whole lot more to the plot than this and the scenes are rife with clunky dialogue. But when the planes take to the air you will be blown away.

Top Gun was also a good movie because of the excitement you get from watching the movie. Also, it was a good move because it had a lot of the same characters that the original movie had.\n\tTop Gun: Maverick is a movie about the U.S. Navy Fighter Weapons School(Top Gun) this is where the top fighter pilot gets more training to produce the best pilots in the world and it worked.\nTop Gun: Maverick followed to first movie's plot very well, it even included the first movie's plot into it. For example, Maverick's(Tom Cruise) co-pilot's (Anthony Edwards) son(Miles Teller) went to the Top Gun school, and in the movie, they showed conflicts between the son and Maverick that reflect what happened in the original movie Top Gun. \nTop Gun: Maverick is a movie that gives you a lot of excitement because, as you are watching it the plot develops but not in a way where you can predict the entire movie. For example when you are watching scenes where the piolets are making hard turns to avoid crashing into a mountain. The camera angles allow very focused people to get hints about what the movie is going to be about and who it's going to be about.\nAnother reason why it's a good movie is that it has some of the same characters as the movie. Also, the new characters that they have are likable characters not just a replacement for the old character. For example, Tom Cruise is in both movies and the directors did not replace him. The Movies were made 36 years apart but seems like they were made right after each other because the plot flows from one movie to another. The places in the movie are the same as the original movie places this adds a level of detail that I have not seen in any other movie. \nAlthough some people might say that it relies on the plot of the first movie, I would disagree because the movie does a good job of explaining some of what happened in the first movie. Also, the movie is a movie that follows a plot line connected to the first movie so if you were to watch the second movie then you would probably watch the first. \nTop Gun: Maverick was a good movie. It follows the plot of the first movie very well. Top Gun: Maverick is a movie that brings the watcher a lot of excitement watching the plot of the movie develop but not in the way you expected it to. The Movie has a lot of the same characters as the first movie. Top Gun: Maverick is the best movie that I have seen.",

The script has been vastly improved upon with updated dialogue just all around better acting than the original. There were not corny lines or interactions that felt awkward. The aerial combat sections are incredible, they are done with such precision and purpose. I could actually understand what was on and where the fighter crafts were in relation to each. These raised the stacks and hade me fully invested.\n\nThe overall story is pretty great. I loved how the recruits were training for a final \"suicide\" mission, instead of just graduating from the academy. The dynamics between Tom Cruise and his superiors/students were great and felt witty and genuine. The continued relationship with Iceman was touching as they seem to have a real connection that has lasted throughout the years, although I thought his illness and they way they presented it was a bit out of place. My one big complain his Cruises love interest. This plot really has no impact on the story and is just thrown in there for old time sakes. I did enjoy their chemistry together and it was cute to his interactions with daughter. But, I watched the original directly before this and was utterly confused on who she was. It was really odd to have a throw away line in the original be the main love interest in the sequel, but like I said, it did not have a huge impact.\n\nThe performances are spectacular in this film. Tom Cruise and Miles Teller are standouts and their back and forth is really fun to see, delivering some funny jabs but some series dramatic moments. Jon Hamm was great as a hard ass commanding officer. Glen Powell was a standout as well, his cockiness and rivalry with Rooster was great but complex.\n\nThis film is a blast, and I really wish I would have made the time to see it in theaters. I really enjoyed this and I am definitely not one who fancies these types of films, but it captured me.\n\nScore: 87%\nVerdict: Excellent",

Top Gun: Maverick presents the argument that any man, woman or person of color is capable of excellence without sacrificing plot, contriving script, or assassinating character. It does so without any need to present the female in the guise of a male in order to elevate her, and without the need to crucify the male lead in order to satisfy a resentful audience. \n\nWhat is most admirable about this movie is how it delivers on incredibly human themes that are vital, now more than ever before, to our current culture. Screen writers Ehren Kruger, Eric Warren Singer, and Christopher McQuarrie seamlessly present extremely important themes such as selflessness, confidence, how to take a woman's breath away, and how to create enduring friendships forged in competition. It even dares to present Commander \"Iceman\" Kazansky in a rather female light, as a patient, supportive, and compassionate authority. Take that, intersectionality! Family members of the enlisted will appreciate how director Joseph Kosinski does his very best to relay the incredible depth of feeling and emotion that is saying goodbye to a loved one that is headed into battle. All of this while developing a flawed protagonist who struggles to overcome his demons and deliver the best man he can be. \n\n\"Top Gun: Maverick\" is a true hero story, the likes of which we grew up on, and one that will inspire endless generations to come.",

The silliness and campiness from the original was replaced with meaningful dialog and deeper character development.  They didn't insult the intelligence of the audience and often would tell the story with just a facial expression.  I was caught off guard by an appearance of Val Kilmer in a poignant scene between Maverick and Ice.  Finally we have a worthy sequel which could be argued to be better than the original.",

            "content": "In the interest of full disclosure, I must confess to backtracking on a statement I made on social media when this film was first released. At that time, I had said I wouldn't see this movie because I believed it to be little more than a veiled recruiting vehicle for the US military and that it was something I couldn't support. However, awards season accolades for this offering backed me into a corner, essentially forcing me into having to see it to remain informed and credible about the unfolding of these events, so I reluctantly relented. Unfortunately, after having watched it, my initial assessment was borne out. This overblown, testosterone-dripping, clich\u00e9d, corny, predictable 2+-hour ad for the US Navy lived up to all of my expectations. This tale of an aging fighter ace-turned-test pilot (Tom Cruise) who's tapped to train a team of young flyers for a virtually impossible bombing run to take out a plutonium enrichment plant in Iran (no enemy stereotyping here, ahem) follows a formulaic script with trite dialogue and plenty of sly macho winks and nods. To its credit, the film features superb aerial camera work and editing, making for a number of visually thrilling dogfight sequences (a major \"cool, dude\" aspect of the picture's underlying military marketing intentions), and it manages to slip in a few \"sensitive male\" story threads to show that modern-day enlisted men can be at least superficially politically correct (a changing-of-the-times narrative adjustment from the film's original). But, even with these admirable attributes, I genuinely fail to understand how so many critics and viewers don't see what's really going on here. To say that director Joseph Kosinski's latest is truly worthy of the honors it has received thus far \u2013 such as a Golden Globe nomination for best dramatic film and the National Board of Review's award for the year's best picture \u2013 is clearly an overreach, especially in terms of what it's really all about to begin with. In my view, it's yet another example of the decline of the American movie industry and how willing audiences are to settle for it.",

Top Gun: Maverick has proven that cinemas and the cinema experience still matters.

Quite possibly a movie of the century? \n\nFrom all sides it tackles the perfect movie for anyone to sit down & watch, unless vertigo inside a jet isn't your thing :) \n\nIt's brilliantly done in how it tries to follow after the sequel (can't blame anyone if actors/actresses don't want to come back to the role, though it does make a few things confusing such as Maverick's seemingly main love interest who appears to not be the same woman.) Aside from that, I applause in how this movie takes on the cursed \"diversity\" role.\nIt's subtle & that's exactly what the world outside of the USA needs. Not everyone has the same problems as this country & upon seeing black media (& etc) shoved down their throats, it becomes unpleasant (The Little Mermaid (2023), Wakanada Forever, The Woman King) these movies fail, terribly.\n\nWhat Top Gun: Maverick does is that it still shows diversity in characters but it's done so in a subtle way that yes, you notice it, but those characters aren't making it their entire personality. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Everyone got a bit of screen time & it was well executed. Each diverse background character still left a lasting impression that you'll remember & relate to them but not so much as a struggle for centrepiece. Everyone knows that this was Maverick's story, not theirs. While the characters were interesting it was done in a way that yes they still mattered & you could relate to them without having the feeling of them just being there for the sake of diverse roles. \n\nThe story between Rooster & Maverick is written beautifully, the entire story is, even the comedic parts. A brief nostalgic moment from the 1980s is seemingly what everyone wants to see in the theatres but with a slightly more modern twist. We still love watching the original Top Gun of course but seeing Top Gun: Mavericks gives us a sense of moving on, growing up & facing the fears of a world that we no longer are used to which makes it all the more exciting & breath-holding.\n\nSpeaking of which, when seeing this in the cinemas, the photography was absolutely stunning. Amazing & memorable soundtrack also, though it may not get stuck in your head like it's predecessor, it's nice enough to listen to & recognise where it's from. The patriotic parts of the American military aren't so heavily as pressed either, so in a way, you're still cheering for them, even though they're not your military & you don't know who they're fighting but you still hold your breath & hope they'll win. \n\nThis movie is a 100% brilliant in all aspects & should serve as an example of what media should strive to be when serving its people. In a technological world where everyone can see everything, this should be the golden standard of media & I hope more people in the industry strive to become like this. Whilst not all movies are action & military & romance, Top Gun: Maverick serves a healthy portion of each genre without being overbearing. \n\nPs. For those arguing of the whole \u2018propaganda' aspect, so be it. The brotherhood of the military does make you think that maybe there's a family waiting for you or maybe it's just not your thing. Whatever it may be, just know that it took them almost 40 years to make a sequel, which probably cost a lot & the US military (navy) told them that they could do whatever they wanted, so long as Tom Cruise didn't touch the controls ;) wicked.",

They abound in so many advertisements from the 1980s to the internet memes of today. For the longest time, I always felt that was all there was to the movie. I eventually sat down and saw the movie a few years ago in its entirety and I finally understood the hype. I saw it for a whole week, and I had so much fun watching it. 1986 had modest movies but it was Top Gun that dominated the year. I also remembered that there was no sequel, at least not in theaters but countless video games were made in the arcades and consoles. I figured that was how it was always going to be what with Tom Cruise wanting to be an actor with a substantial career. Not even Cruise taking over a franchise with Mission Impossible could make me believe he would ever make a sequel and if he did, it wouldn't compare. I think it is more than fair to say I was wrong.\n\n2022. Thirty-six years after the original movie was made, a sequel was finally made and it's not just as good as the original, it's better! Though to be fair, it looks like 2022 has been another modest year for movies, its only fair Top Gun dominates. The story goes as follows, Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell has gone from being the US Naval Aviator Lieutenant into a US Naval Aviator Captain, distinguished beyond distinguished. But his age is keeping him from getting all the assignments he got when he was in his twenties. But he's getting one last shot at the place that made him, Top Gun. Only the story here is not so much himself as it is for the past. Ordered to teach a new generation of Top Gun graduates how to fly a nearly impossible mission, he gets in trouble with someone very dear to him, Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw, the son of his beloved best friend from the first movie Goose.\n\nFrom here is an entertaining tale of action and drama that goes to show that despite the many years and different directors, a great story is a great story. Tom Cruise hasn't lost a step like Maverick, showing age is just a number. But it's the beauty of seeing Val Kilmer, a talented actor having been absent for a decade is explained here. With many new faces but welcome faces with callbacks to the old. I couldn't imagine loving this movie as much as I did. Truly the best movie of the year.",

For true military riders it's almost always ATGATT or not ride at all.\nIn the behind the scenes making the movie companion and stunt riders wore ATGATT (All The Gear All The Time). Willing to change a flag to appease a Communist regime but not do something so simple as wear head gear. What is wrong with this guy? Again this is a Single One Issue review, Can someone legitimately find any military (let alone a runway or taxiway) not do anything about PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)?

I was disappointed to not see Kelly McGillis, Tom Skerrit, Michael Ironside, or Meg Ryan in it. I was happy to see Val Kilmer reprise his role as Iceman, but it would have been nice if some of the original cast was brought back, adding to the nostalgia of the film. But the flight sequences and aerobatics with the planes was amazing and the footage was incredible. I really liked how the brought the F-14 in at the end as a nod to the old film and honoring its predecessor, putting Maverick and Rooster into the same cockpit scenario that Maverick and Goose were in.

            "content": "Tom Cruise delivers Oscar worthy lead acting in a heartfelt sequel to Top Gun.\n\nDirector Joseph Kosinski's war action-drama Top Gun: Maverick (2022) pays tribute to Tony Scott's Top Gun with stunning cinematography, heartfelt characters, and exhilarating aerial combat. I'd like to think that Tony Scott would be proud of Kosinski for keeping Top Gun character driven. Writers Christopher McQuarrie, Ehren Kruger, Justin Marks, Peter Craig, and Eric Warren Singer nail the mature tone and softer story about aging, grief, forgiveness, comradery, rekindled love, and promises. Top Gun: Maverick's moving drama is surprising and welcomed alongside thrilling aerial battles with Tom Cruise uplifting the film into soaring new heights.\n\nKosinski's direction shoots all these insane aerial dogfights with real Navy jets that are genuinely astonishing to behold. I personally appreciate his character focus to portray how Maverick is still grieving the loss of Goose and guilty over not being able to save his friend. Kosinski has now directed Tron: Legacy, Oblivion, and Top Gun: Maverick that I enjoyed very much, so he continues to be a fascinating director. His sincere approach to drama and then striking visuals for action feels smooth and effortless. Top Gun: Maverick is something special.\n\nEddie Hamilton's editing is slick with these cool transitions from talking to flying. The plane sequences are cut with an easy to follow continuity that's easier to read than even the first Top Gun. I found cinematographer Claudio Miranda's wide shots in the sky truly breathtaking. There's nothing more impressive visually than the camera right on the plane or looking out the jet window out at the Sun. All the close-ups during Maverick's conversation with Iceman actually got me crying.\n\nTom Cruise is phenomenal and subtle in a wonderfully understated dramatic return as Top Gun pilot Maverick. He's engaging and concerned for his fellow pilots as Cruise ensures you know how worried and conflicted Maverick now feels. He's an old hero aging out of the flight programs in the Navy and Maverick feels he has to help these young pilots return home safely out of reverence for his lost friend Goose from Top Gun. Cruise will get tears out of you in a tender and sophisticated acting performance from Cruise in the middle of an action movie. His heartfelt scene doubting himself with Val Kilmer's bittersweet return as Iceman is very touching. Tom Cruise can still do incredible dramatic work as an actor, not just a triumphant action star.\n\nJennifer Connelly is fantastic and moving as Penny Benjamin in a cute rekindled love interest and appreciated age appropriate relationship for Tom Cruise's Maverick. She feels forward and mature with a playful liveliness. I like how she is there to encourage Maverick, while demanding he really love her and be himself again. She's a steadfast lover and a wonderful choice for Maverick's new flame. Lyliana Wray is nice and serious as Penny's protective daughter Amelia Benjamin. I loved her line directly telling Maverick not to break her mother's heart ever again. I like to think she's really his daughter from back then, even though that's not in the script.\n\nMiles Teller is stern and frustrated as the angry Rooster. He holds his own against a forlorn and guilty Tom Cruise when Rooster and Maverick are arguing about his continued desire to fly dangerously. I think he does a respectable job as Goose's son.\n\nJon Hamm's stern and condescending Vice Admiral Cyclone is interesting as he wants obedience from Maverick and success even at the potential cost of Naval pilots' lives. Glen Powell steals all his scenes as a charismatic and arrogant pilot named Hangman because he leaves his team out to hang at the sign of trouble. Lewis Pullman looks just like his dad Bill Pullman as the nerdy and quiet Bob, who is very honest and steadfast.\n\nEd Harris cameos as the blunt and furious Rear Admiral Hammer. Monica Barbaro is pretty and confident as Phoenix in a nice supporting role for her. Charles Parnell is quite touching as Warlock, especially in his supportive and knowing moments with Tom Cruise's Maverick. Jay Ellis' Payback, Danny Ramirez' Fanboy, Greg Tarzan Davis' Coyote, and Bashir Salahuddin's Hondo all get their moments. Hans Zimmer and Harold Faltermeyer's score are massive and powerful like Lady Gaga's wonderful soundtrack single for Top Gun: Maverick.\n\nIn all, Top Gun: Maverick is worth seeing for sure. Tom Cruise's magnetic performance is thoughtful and moving, while Kosinski's fighter plane dogfights are unreal to witness.",

I liked how the audience can easily make this connection even without having knowledge about the previous Top Gun movie. This cinematic masterpiece was intense, loud, action-filled, funny, imaginative, and even included a touch of romance. For generally not being a huge action genre lover, this movie surprised me. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, anticipating what was going to happen next. Throughout the cast, there was a perfect balance of all sorts of personalities and each actor/actress fit into their respective roles perfectly. Tom Cruise and Miles Teller made an unstoppable duo that was both unexpected and uneasy at first. It is a must-see movie, and I would recommend it to anyone.

Maverick is Luke Skywalker, the admirals are all Darth Vaders, and Maverick is the only person who has \"the Force\". Instead of traveling along a narrow channel on the Death Star, Luke (oops - Maverick) has to travel down a valley (Beggar's Canyon?) and surpisingly, has to put two bombs (not torpedoes this time) into an open about 2 meters wide. Does that sound familiar? He gets rescued by Han Solo now named \"Rooster\" and they have to escape from a nasty planet and are also chased by TIE Fighters now call 5th generation fighters. Overall, I am surpised that Disney and / or George Lucas has not sued someone over this Star Wars on Earth movie.  And I guess breaking several military laws / procedures is okay as long as you are Tom Cruise and there is no time in the brig or at least confined to quarters.\nSilly movie. It passed the time but Tom, it is time to hang it up. By the time you finished flight training, you were about 24. You have been flying for 30 years and so you are about 54. Most pilots are not flying combat missions at that age, at least not in F/A 18s. Go retire, or get command of a ship and sit down...",

It is so unbelievable that even at 59 he looks hell young as someone of 45 years, or even younger. His down to earth attitude with a smart personality is always a winning point.\n\nFor those who haven't watched 1986's masterpiece and original Top Gun, I strongly advise you to watch it, because it has emotional and eventual connection with this sequel. Val Kilmer's short yet impactful role of Admiral Iceman, now a sufferer of throat cancer, shares emotional bonding with Pete in a short period. Roles of young pilot trainees and graduates played by Miles Teller, Glenn Powell and Monica Barbaro are outstanding and performed exceptionally brilliant.\n\nLast but not the least, Jennifer Connelly deserves a strong applause for her performance as Pete's new love interest Penelope and a single mother. Her presence alongside Tom adds a slight comfort and helps in moving the story forward.\n\nOverall, this one is one of the greatest movie sequals Better than the original in everyway..A Pure masterpiece",

It was a parody of itself except not funny except for the beach volleyball scene. It barely existed outside of its own universe.
