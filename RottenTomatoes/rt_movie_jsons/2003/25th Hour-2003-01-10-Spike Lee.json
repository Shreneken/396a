The place the hero finds himself in is not so different from Nick Shay's. The desert where our hero is perhaps led to is also the resort for the heroes of DeLillo, who turn to the desert when they need to think. I'll probably never get rid of this association now, especially with \"Underworld\" (1997) and \"Point Omega\" (2010).",

            "content": "The concept alone \u2014 a man's (Edward Norton) final 24 hours before he begins a 7-year prison sentence \u2014 has its own tension and naturally accumulates anxiety with each passing minute. Monty (Norton) probably did some bad shit (he was a heroin dealer for the Russian Mob), but we don't really see any of it, so he's a sympathetic character. Frank (Barry Pepper), a Wall Street financier, has an apartment that overlooks the World Trade Center's rubble in the aftermath of 9/11. In fact, the whole post-9/11 context transported me back to that time, which forever changed our country. From this, we get Monty's tirade against seemingly every group that inhabits the city \u2014 Dominicans, Italians, Pakistanis, Russians, Puerto Ricans, etc. etc. \u2014 while looking in a bar bathroom mirror. I found myself much more interested in how Monty was handling his final moments as a free man than determining who had sold him out to the DEA. The Naturelle (Rosario Dawson) subplot concerning whether or not she had sold her man up the river didn't make sense to me. What was her motivation? She lived a really good life with Monty, but once he went to prison, she would have to move back in with her mother and would lose his income stream from dealing drugs. Frank's suspicion and interrogation of her seemed like a waste of time. What really did it for me was the ending. James (Brian Cox), Monty's father, on the drive to prison attempts to goad his son into fleeing, moving out West, laying low and eventually reunite with Naturelle, start a family. The voiceover (with Cox's incredible voice (Yes, I know the irony re: his character in Adaptaion)) makes you feel it right in the chest. You forget, and then hope, that it's not a plan, but Monty's reality. That Monty had listened to his father and they took that bridge out of New York and into the plains and mountains and deserts of the country where Americans had escaped to restart their lives for years. It's a beautiful monologue, but the fact it's merely a father's wish, is an even better ending.",

            "content": "Hey, did you know that the author of the original novel that this film is based on is David Benioff himself? That's right, one of the most significant cinematic explorations of the national consciousness after 9/11 had its source material penned by the guy who dropped the handoff on S7/8 of Game of Thrones. \n\nSpike Lee has usually been pretty hit or miss for me; he's either clever, funny, and insightful or mind-blowingly on-the-nose. Maybe it's because Lee had so little to do with the writing and had more time to showcase his talents as a pure director that the film comes across as so distinct from many of the other Lee joints (though his particular treatment of New York City is just one of his anachronisms that you can still find on display here, like a few very prominent American flags). Whatever the reason, in an iteration of Hollywood that seems to have been shockingly unwilling to take on sincere dramatic takes on 9/11, contenting themselves to drop a couple courageous or feel-good storylines (Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close, Flight 93) that don't even touch on the sense of loss and grief that an entire country experienced. In this film, Lee and Benioff use the last hours of a man's freedom before incarceration as a means of exploring a wider sense of self-reflection - what is important, how do we deal with tragedy? \n\nBut then again someone on the team decided to call out 'Sopranos wannabees' and then cast Isiah Whitlock Jr. just to say \"Sheeiit\" in the same way he was notorious for doing on another HBO classic, The Wire, so I guess there's some room for opinion on whether every creative choice with this film was the right one.

More seldomly, you are fortunate enough to hit upon a film that can justifiably be called great on the basis of its immaculate execution and the resonance of its themes. Then, there are the rarest of experiences which amount to the cinematic equivalent of the unearthing of the holy grail: the discovery of that mere handful of films which carry you to heights that you never new were possible, literally taking the breath away and leaving you stunned in the presence of undeniable greatness. Spike Lee's \"The 25th Hour\" fits into this most elite category of films, astounding the unsuspecting viewer with a complex elegiac poem of such potent anguish and crushing despair that it could easily stand in for any moment in life in which we face the perception that the worst is sure to happen or has already happened, and there is no going back. Ever looming in the background is the specter of 9/11, leaving no misconceptions about the cataclysmic source of the film's boundless effusion of regret and despondency. A simple description of the film's plot is unnecessary, in that it can't even begin to hint at the operatic scope of the film's emotional wellspring. \"The 25th Hour\" thus establishes itself as a magnum opus in the esteemed catalogue of Spike Lee, solidly positioning itself in the ranks of the most visionary films ever made.",

Edward Norton like all his roles steals the show, a truly fantastic actor who has a deep passion for the acting roles he commits himself to. Some of the writing, dialogue and acting performance from Norton combine to have you completely entranced. The mirror scene as Monty looks deeper within himself and his hatred reminded me of American History X. The last scene with his father fantasying about the life his son could've lived was also done incredibly well. Where the film fails is the filmmaking itself, there's so many jarring unneeded edits that show shots multiple times. Most of the dialogue between the characters last way to long. It's not like they are talking about things of importance within the story. Overall most of this film could've been cut and edited much better.",

            "content": "25th Hour is a movie based on a book that you can tell used to be a book. It's a faithful adaptation by way of taking the time to extrapolate and portray (and sometimes betray) these characters on screen, the way they snap at each other like only old friends and lovers can, the way they talk behind each others backs, but then have said back when the need arises. \n\nThe source material's strengths (and script by a pre-Game of Thrones Benioff) are that the ramifications of the 25th hour are felt by all involved, and these characters are all of them culpable in their own ways, and corrupted, loveable, realistic, twisted and full of shades of grey. The dialogue is biting and lyrical, poignant and captures that real darkness. They accuse each other with the blinkers of themselves on.\n\nEdwards Norton sings, an understated but typically tremendous performance, in fact, every cast member is at the top of their game, Barry Pepper, such an underrated actor is a perfect asshole, Rosario Dawson plays young and old so well in this movie it's like two different people and the incomparable Philip Seymour Hoffman is sad and hilarious. By the morning they all look, walk and talk like haggard older men, out all night, they let themselves be ugly.\n\nSpike Lee has taken someone else's story and taken the state of his soul following 9/11 and he fused them into one story. Lee transposes his heartbreak, angst, pain and anger into this story, it's every bit his work as it is Benioff's book; not only was it cautionary and timely tale at the time, but its messages still resonate today. Spike Lee, a man who could describe New York City as \"his city\" made a film that reflected its shattered soul. When the camera frames Ground Zero out of focus for a conversation and then racks it into focus and Terence Blanchard's score swells, it's indelibly haunting and moving.\n\nThat scene, yes that scene. The Mirror scene. It's a bravura piece of filmmaking, writing and of acting; The jarring poetry of it stirs a dual idea of blame culture (more relevant now even than it was after 9/11) and then when this scene is reflected at the end, the very human idea that it's the things you think you hate about something, is more often than not, were the reasons you maybe actually loved about it.\n\nDuring that scene and all over 25th Hour is the most soulful soundtrack I've ever heard; it's accusatory and soothing, it's almost constant throughout the film which is novel, and it seems to bleed a kind of unified pain; it has a sense of collective mourning, and the voices of the dead. It speaks for those that aren't there. It says the things that no one in the film does.\n\nAnd that ending. I won't say anything about it suffice to say that it's also such a bold commitment, doubling down on the real pain of that 25th hour; just as powerful as the slow-start and slow reveal of what this film is even about. Even though I've never been in Monty's situation, there's that feeling; missing time, missed opportunities, passing over to new life, changes you made but never knew would happen, something like that, that pervades this entire film and makes it completely relatable in some esoteric and deeply human way.\n\n25th Hour is my favourite Spike Lee movie. It has all of his hallmarks, his passions and his knowledge, but it's different, it's the New Yorker in him that made this film, not his race, it's a film that's more relevant than ever. It comes from deep within; when a person in this film embraces and the editing tries to snatch the same moment twice or three times, almost overlapping, you can palpably feel the characters try and snatch that moment back as if in protest to the shortness in time and amount of these moments left in their lives, or like the mind trying to remember the moments in the past that really mattered, when two people came together.",

            "content": "This was a decent little film that featured some great performances, some inspired directorial choices and an unfortunate touch of sexism. Is it one of the greatest films of the 21st century? No, I don't think so but in terms of dealing with 9/11 and the fallout that it caused it is second only to Margaret (2011). I'm not very familiar with Spike Lee's oeuvre, having only seen one other film that he's directed in Blackklansman (2018), but he's clearly a director who is passionate about showing the tensions present in New York City and he is able to direct actors to giving some of their best performances. This is a film worth watching if you are looking for an interesting character study trapped inside a slightly uneven film.\n\nMonty Brogan, Edward Norton, is a drug dealer who is spending his final day before serving a seven year prison sentence in New York with his girlfriend Naturelle, Rosario Dawson, his father James, Brian Cox, and his friends, arrogant banker Frank, Barry Pepper, and shy teacher Jacob, Philip Seymour Hoffman. He begins to suspect that it was Naturelle who revealed his illegal activities to the authorities, placing further strain on their relationship, while he and his father attempt to come to terms with how Monty's life has ended up. The night ends with a party being thrown at a night club for Monty at which Jacob is seduced by his provocative student Mary, Anna Paquin, and Frank provokes him into defending Naturelle.\n\nThe high point of the film, to me, came in the final moments as Cox displays why he is such a respected actor and delivers a frenzied monologue in which he describes a fantastical future for his son in which he is able to run away and assume a new identity. The sequence is emotionally affecting as we see Monty growing old and having children with Naturelle, the ideal life, but we then cut back to reality swiftly and realize that will not be Monty's life and he will be left to rot in a prison cell. We see fantasies represented very literally throughout the film as we see still shots of exactly what the voice over describes and this straightforward expression of the desires of the characters feels more authentic than any attempt at subtlety in a very non-subtle film.\n\nThe performances of Pepper and Hoffman are also fantastic as they play thoroughly dislikable characters as sympathetic or at least very watchable people. Pepper spits out his lines venomously as he spews dialogue that sounds like it would be delivered without a touch of irony by Gordon Gekko in Wall Street (1987). The lack of self awareness he possesses while still being obnoxious makes him oddly watchable and Pepper is unrelenting in showing his character to be awful. Hoffman gets a very difficult role as he plays a man who lusts after his underage student, if he acted on his desires it would be a criminal offense, but in a way that seems strangely innocent. The film provides a conclusion to this plotline that is satisfactory as we see both characters horrified by their actions when they do kiss but it doesn't do an American Beauty (1999) and portray Jacob as a savior of sorts. The acting in the film is amazing and it lifts a story that feels choppy at times above being an interesting but not fully realized independent film.\n\nMy major issue with the film was the portrayal of female characters, particularly Naturelle, as Dawson is sexually objectified while playing a character with very little to do. We see her for long stretches of time in close up shots of her body while lights flash around her and it felt gratuitous instead of offering anything to the plot. Although her character technically effects the plot significantly Dawson gets nothing to do but lounge around in bathtubs and appear as a sexy schoolgirl. I so wanted Lee to have a more nuanced portrayal of women in his film but instead the film verged on being a Roger Corman vehicle for minutes at a time. Even a small misstep can lower a film to being just average when it verged on greatness and unfortunately this was one of those for me.",

You can never run from your friends and you can never run from who you are.",

Edward Norton gives a very good performance as the man who will make the very most of the time he has left of his freedom before embarking on the jail terms.\n\nHe is absolutely determined to spend time with his pals, with good support being offered from Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Barry Pepper, while making some time with his girlfriend, played by Rosario Dawson.\n\nThe acting from all the cast is good and the direction from Lee is very solid. Norton gives the best performance without any doubt, but there is one scene in the film which can be very offensive where Norton rants in his bathroom, so I do have to criticize the screenplay written by David Benioff. However despite this one scene and having a lot of bad language, the script is well written as you can understand what is happening.\n\nThe dramatic moments keep you on the edge-of-your-seat from the moment the movie gets going and Norton proved that his performance in American History X was definitely not a one-off, as he would now definitely become one actor to look out for in the future.\n\nDespite the horrible bad language, there are scenes which keep you on the edge-of-your-seat and it's one decent little movie with Norton on top form.",

The movie is well acted and really plays on how peoples emotions are connected and how certain events will let the real you come out. It's about saying goodbye to a place you a hate and a place that hates you back, but how there is still so much sorrow in doing something like that especially a place you've called home for so long.

It is perhaps the only movie made in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks that captured the mood of that time. Lee shows great assurance here and limits the expected indulgences, while expressing surprising pathos to conventional material. Norton brings his usual intensity to the role, but he also has the sensitivity to reveal a man with remorse at his wasted life. As a cocky stockbroker, Barry Pepper shows the conflicted feelings - both brutally honest and mealy-mouthed - of a close friend that rings truthful. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is a straight arrow teacher, Rosario Dawson is the beautiful girlfriend, Brian Cox is the loyal father, and Anna Paquin is a provocative student. All give exceptional performances. Former football player Tony Siragusa is perhaps a bit too broad a caricature as a Ukrainian associate. David Benioff adapted his own book.

            "content": "The movie 25th Hour starts with a scene of two beam lights projecting from the Ground Zero, the place of the twin towers that fell in 9/11. Although what happened in 9/11 does not really have to do with the plot of the movie, it acted as an inter-textual reference that added an atmosphere of tragedy and melancholy to the narrative of the movie.  The plot of the movie goes around the last 24 hours of New Yorker drug dealer, Monty Brogan, before he goes to jail for 7 years after DEA found drugs in his house. \n\tIn those 24 hours he tries to come along with his father, Naturelle his girlfriend, and Frank and Jacob 2 of his elementary school best friends. The movie spots the lights on the importance of choices one take throughout his life. In this few hours Monty evaluates his past life and regret the choices he made, and he condemns how he made his own life miserable. The only choice he never regretted instead he mentioned that it was the best of his life was saving the dog that was left for dead on the bridge at the beginning of the movie. Maybe he assumes that since he unconsciously wished that someone could have done the same to him. He maybe wished that someone could stop him from drug dealing before getting caught and being sentenced to jail. Although his friends condemned themselves how they saw him screwing his life, they never actually talked to him.  The movie is not only about the story of failure of the protagonist, but also of all those around him to save him. It's about relationships and the collective responsibility it entails. \n\tOne of the best scenes in the movie is the \"Mirror speech\" scene in which the Monty's mirror reflection starts to curse every single ethnic group, race, and even his own friends and family after seeing the words \"fuck you\" written on the mirror. The scene can be interpreted as a clash between his unconscious and his rationale blended with the principle of \"condensation and displacement\" by Freud. His reflection in the mirror being part of his unconscious that condenses his desperateness and anger from his life and displaces it into hate for almost everyone in New York City; it can be that he blames everyone in the city in an attempt to escape that his choices were not his fault only. But then at the end of the scene, when he curses himself, it was the time he recognized that it was his own choices that led to what he is in today and no one other than him is responsible for that. \nIt was not only Monty that acknowledges his failure, his friends as well acknowledged theirs by not helping him; however, Frank was not so clear about this aspect. There was one scene in which both Jacob and frank were talking about what happened to Monty while watching workers cleaning Ground Zero from Frank's apartment window in which Frank criticized Jacob's for believing that they would see Monty again after finishing his jail sentence. However, when he had the same conversation with Monty, Frank ended up saying the exact opposite.  He even promises to help Monty get set up when he comes out.  And in the same conversation at the window Frank says to Jacob: \nYeah, he got caught.  But our old Monty is a fucking drug dealer.  Shit.  What, are you driving a vintage super V?   No?  Yeah, he is.  Paid for by the misery of the other people.  He got caught and will be locked up.  And I'll tell you something else; you two are my best friends in the whole world.  I love him like a brother, but he fucking deserves it.  He deserves it (25th Hour).\n\nAfter this scene when they all went to a club to enjoy the last few hours with Monty. There he begins to wonder what responsibility does he share in Monty getting into prison.  He starts to express these thoughts to Naturalle, Monty's girlfriend.  He mentions how he never said a word to discourage Monty from becoming a drug dealer.  When she replies that Monty would have never listened anyway to make him feel better, Frank begins to accuse her to be part of Monty's downfall as well.  He points out that she is even more to blame because she enjoyed living with Monty from drug money. It could be understood that frank at the beginning did not want to confess to himself that he is part of his friend's fall down, but later he realized that not only him but all of them share the responsibility of Monty continuing drug dealing. \n\tBefore the final scene Monty asks Frank to make him look ugly so the prisoners wont think he is good looking and weak in the first day and sexually harass him. He pushed Frank into doing it by telling him \"I think you can, you know what I think you want to, too, a little bit. You think I deserve it a little bit. For years you've been giving me that look, like you want to smack some sense into me. This is your chance. I need it, Frank.\" (25th Hour) He knew frank thought that he deserves all of what is happening to him at one point. So he decided to redeem himself from the slave role he would have played in the prison by ruining his face. It is hard for one to take such a decision, but to get salvation sacrifice was a must.\n\tIn the final scene, it was not very clear whether Monty went to jail or ran away to the west as his father advised him. His father, while picking him up to jail so he can turn himself in, took him to a far town in the west where all people there are running away from something so he can disappear and never come back home. There he searched for a job and after a while secretly he contacted Naturalle to come. They lived together and built a big bonded family that cared for each other. All of a sudden, the scene goes back to Monty in his father's car driving down the way. All of that was nothing but a foreshadowing to what he thinks would happen if he takes a choice to escape.  This foreshadowing supports that he did actually go to the jail since if he did not the scenes of him going to a far town a building a new life for him would not have been just an imagination in his mind.",

My favorite films of his are Do the Right Thing, Malcolm X, Inside Man, and the documentary, 4 Little Girls. I picked up the Spike Lee Collection Vol. 1 on Blu-ray out of a urge to revisit He Got Game during the 2014 NBA Finals, and a curiosity about this film that most people in the forums I visit were interested in, 25th Hour. Boy am I glad I did. I actually preferred this film over the one I bought the double feature for most.\n\nThe film follows Monty (Norton) as he prepares to go to prison for a seven year sentence the following day. He's highly respected among New York's seedy underbelly, and he has to come to grips with the decisions he's made and effects they are having on his friends and family. This is truly a performance driven piece, and said performances are all top notch. Edward Norton leads a stellar cast in this gripping dramatic tour de force. He's joined here by the late Philip Seymour Hoffman, Rosario Dawson, Brian Cox, Anna Paquin, Isiah Whitlock Jr., and an exceptional Barry Pepper in what may just be his best performance to date.\n\nA few things to note here are the amazingly gorgeous visuals and the fantastic score by Terence Blanchard. The cinematography by Lee and Diego Prieto (The Wolf of Wall Street, Argo, Babel, and many other beautiful films) is washed out, with high contrast, and looks damn near painted on a canvas. There is true technical prowess on display here. I recommend seeing the film for its visual and auditory artistry alone. And definitely on Blu-ray if possible. It has a top notch transfer.\n\nI do have some complaints, but they are few and far between. Some of the characterizations seemed pointless and out of place, like Paquin's character for example. While her performance was rock solid, her role seemed unnecessary. Whatever message her relationship with Hoffman's character was meant to convey, it was lost on me. Perhaps with time and revisits that will become more fleshed out in my mind. Another complaint I had was that it seemed to meander a bit towards the end, and the curve ball they threw was somewhat unsatisfactory. Even with those complaints, there is a lot to love here. Great film.",

That film worked as a sort of parable piece, featuring a wide and colorful cast. This film, however, takes a interesting character (played wonderfully by Edward Norton) and plunges us into the biggest turning point in his life - settling his accounts with his friends and family before spending the next 7 years in prison. More than this, it is a story about protesting everything about the world that you hate (shown brilliantly in the much talked about F*** You mirror scene) and coming around to realizing and appreciating those things as aspects of yourself. It also deals with what it means to be a man. I enjoy this film with the same type of feeling as I did in reading Catcher in the Rye. Edward Norton has a sort of Caulfield No Bullshit personality and suddenly enters an enlightened, floating state as he lives his final 24 hours before his entire world fades away. He makes love with his girlfriend one last time, he walks his dog, sees his dad, and goes out with his best friends for one last night. By the way, the club scene in this movie is hands down the best club scene I ever seen. I felt like I was inside this place, and it was popping. Lighting, sound, camera movement, everything. At the end of it all, I left the film feeling like I went through a life changing experience. I had new eyes for the way the world works and the things people do to get by. Each of the characters had great arcs, and each learned something by the film's end. Even though Monty Brogan inevitably ends up behind bars, he went out with a bang. He'll at least have a lot to digest while he's there. I couldn't get this film out of my head for days.",

Although, to be fair, the tone of the film is helped by Terence Blanchard's spine chilling original score.\n\nThe performances of the actors are all down to Earth and simple, but in a good way. Despite being a notorious criminal, Edward Norton's Montgomery Brogan is played very sympathetically. His friends Jakub and Frank, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman and Barry Pepper respectively, are also showcased and are played very well, both going through their own character's problems while at the same time collectively dealing with their friend going away for 7 years.\n\nThe cinematography and the editing also add to the bleak tone of this picture. With the grainy look and bleach bypass performed to the picture.\n\nAll in all, this is in my Top 10 favorite Films of all time list, and like I mentioned earlier, I am not a fan of Spike Lee (although I can respect his earlier films Do The Right Thing and Bamboozled), however, his direction of this film was on par with brilliance, and why 25th hour was ignored by the Academy Awards I'll never know.

There is no over reaching with this film. The only few elements that are in your face are the sprinkled classic Spike Lee tactics of race war. The ensemble of characters are purposefully tense, unsure of their relationships between one another. Their chemistry creates the viewers to demand the revelations of true feelings. Hoffman is not at his best but his awkward unaware state comes right out of the screen. His character comes off course and is explained in a way that does not fit the rest of the film. Pepper is great too with Lee's guidance. The way they shoot him especially in his hectic workplace you see the stress come out of his eyes. He is sleezy and his brutal honesty is used to hide his self doubt beneath his ego. Dawson is decent but brings nothing to her role besides the expectable visibly hurt girlfriend. She does not make her chemistry with Norton seem genuine. Nortons hesitance towards her is the most realistic aspect of their relationship. Towards the beginning of the film you are completely unaware of the later sequences which could be suspenseful but some might find boring. The flashbacks could go drastically in either direction as pointless or strongly fitting, in my opinion they mold the present position suitably. Cox is nothing more or less than he has to be, his heart seems true and his emotions dramatic. Although not fitting and obvious as a Lee tactic, Norton's semi famous rant in the mirror is amazingly written. It shows his rage starting from stereo types to the people close to, perfectly exemplifying someone in his position. It is a hateful poem, ending with self loathing, beautiful, disgusting. The images demonstrating the wake of 9/11  seem unique but truly have no place in the script. Pepper plays dark reality, the harshness of Norton's situation when Hoffman attempts desperation in a sad form of reasoning. It is not a picture of deep morale but instead an intriguing talewith dramatic force for the audience and well rooted characters.",

We see his last day of freedom bidding farewell to friends and relatives.He is mentally unprepared for prison and he says very little on this but you can see the actor communicate this in his face. He confronts himself in a bathroom and realise that there many things he hate about his life and society but in the end he knows he is guilty and this is his own fault. he becomes acountable.\n\nThe movie shot by Rodriego Pietro (Babel) is visually stunning, and the end when James Brogan (Brian Cox) who plays Monty's father offer him an opportunity to run away, done in a voice over, is meant to give the  audience a chance at happy ending. The movie leaves the viewers to decide how they want the movie to end without sacrificing the faithfulness to the story. We thank you.\n\nThis is a powerful movie that leaves you thinking.",

Yet now I feel like I live a little bit closer to that world at times, but in 25th Hour I still feel so distant from this world, but I still care so much about the people and lives that inhabit this part of New York soon after 9/11.  There are events that leave you changed forever, even if they don't directly impact you.  For Monty Brogan (Ed Norton), it will be the beginning of his 7 year prison term that starts within 25 hours of when the film begins.  For his two best friends, father and girlfriend, it will be the loss of the Monty they know.  And all the while the movie takes this journey, the fresh devastation of 9/11 is an unmistakable theme.  Everyone who lived in the vast, magnificent city (that I've still never been to) were changed so dramatically. And you get the sense in the movie that this cloud of sadness, loss and despair fills these characters lives, all the way down to the lighting used.  I find the beginning shots of the city to be very reminiscent of Woody Allen's beginning to Manhattan, but almost like an antonym to those scenes.  Instead of loud, celebratory brass instruments highlighting the city in glorious black and white, in 25th Hour, we get ground swelling surges of symphonic swells that fill the audience with a sense of dread.  Ed Norton's performance carries the burdens of his own mistakes so well.  The rest of the performance are stellar as well.  It does move slowly at times, so don't expect a fast paced movie.  Instead you should expect to reflect on it quite often after your viewing.",

It's considered one of Spike Lee's superlative works, up there with Do the Right Thing and Malcom X, and it's also thought of as one of Edward Norton's best, on par with American History X and Primal Fear. But anyways, so much of it felt like watching for the first time. I was working on my Snow White write up at the time, but kept being drawn into the goings on on the screen. And some of it felt incredibly familiar. I dropped everything for my favorite scene. I have so much more appreciation for the film as a whole now than I did before.\n\nNorton's performance is just such a nuanced mix of strength and vulnerability, a tough guy brought to his breaking point as he prepares to face the next seven years in prison. I'm always in awe of this guy, but what really struck me this time around was his supporting cast. Specifically his two best friends, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman and Barry Pepper. This was really when Hoffman started to move up in my list of favorites, and I've always kept an eye on Pepper after this (and Green Mile). Such an underappreciated actor. Anyways, the scenes that involve any combination of these three characters had my undivided each time. Great dynamic between them, really illustrating their unending loyalty despite their different backgrounds. Their final scene together is so gripping. Again, I've seen it before, but I still just felt it right in the chest.\n\nI always felt the girls were a bit of a miscast. However, I did like Rosario Dawson a bit better this time around. I think what's always felt off is that I dont think I ever quite bought the chemistry between her and Edward Norton. Felt a little forced. But paying closer attention to some of the scenes with her and the other guys, it made a bit more sense. I think the thing that also made it feel off was including the scene where her Naturelle first meets Norton's Monty while she's still in high school. Just enough sketch mixed with their age differences didnt quite work. I also never cared for Anna Paquin in this movie or her storyline. I like that it gave Hoffan's character an internal battle, but she just seemed like such a cliche.\n\nI actually had a few delays in watching this, mostly cause I didnt wanna be in a time crunch. Kinda glad I waited since I was actually able to give this movie the attention it deserves this morning. I'll leave you with one more scene that always stays with me. It's actually a deleted scene, but this is back in the day when I had so few DVDs that the special features were a novelty and I'd watch them all.

Unlike most of Spike Lee's other films(except for the fact that it is once again shot in New York), 25th Hour seems to follow no opinion or debate, and instead tells the story for what it is. Edward Norton is fabulous, mixing characters he's played in other films together to generate a likable, strong character. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is great as usual, with actors such as Anna Paquin and Barry Pepper also playing great roles. If anything 25th hour may have been an excuse for Lee to make a movie showing post Sep. 11 New York, but it doesn't falter or even play on the story. It does get a little weird at the end as Monty's father rattles off, but all up worth watching for the simple yet emotionally complex story.",

            "content": "Most people that I know wouldn\u00e2(TM)t be familiar with Spike Lee and his movies only if they hear me blabbing on about him. Spike Lee is one of my favourite filmmakers and I have recently got into his movies over the last three years. His movies always have some sort of message to them whether it is about colour, prejudice or race. Like Oliver Stone, he can get really in your face with the political message of his movies. He can often be a little over the top and that has occasionally given him a bit of bad press. I think he\u00e2(TM)s a fantastic filmmaker and his movies are brilliant. He is a great storyteller. His early films have introduced actors who have gone off to have successful careers like John Turturro who was in Do the Right Thing, Rosie Perez who was also in Do the Right Thing, Mekhi Phifer who was in Clockers, Halle Berry who was in Jungle Fever and also Samuel L Jackson who was in School Daze, Do the Right Thing and Jungle Fever where he received his first Academy Award Nomination. I have seen most of his films and all of them I have hugely enjoyed and left a great impact on me. Malcolm X was the first one I saw and showed that Denzel Washington is a fine actor and one of the four collaborations he had with Spike. He Got Game another Denzel and Spike movie was the second film I saw and Spike portrayed how bad sports corruption can be on star players with a father and son plot at the heart of the story. Clockers was the next one I saw and this can be seen as a prequel to the remarkable HBO Show, The Wire and showed how drugs and crime can destroy black project neighbourhoods and undermine it\u00e2(TM)s youths. After Clockers came Do the Right Thing and this is widely claimed to be Spike Lee\u00e2(TM)s best movie and I would have to agree with them and I would also have to say that 25th Hour is also one of his best movies. 25th Hour the movie I\u00e2(TM)m about to talk about now is one of my favourites along with Do the Right Thing and Clockers. 25th Hour was the one that I really thought was where he was doing something different and doing something a bit more personal to him. The movie not only is a crime film but also is a tribute to New York and all its citizens who are still in mourning after the horror of 9/11.\nWhen watching this film you can really see how much of New York has changed since 9/11 even though you can\u00e2(TM)t see it. It\u00e2(TM)s like a completely different place. The opening credits of the movie shows the big lights they put up in memoriam of the Twin Towers.  Sets the mood for the film. One scene in the movie and is one of the most powerful scenes in the movie along with Edward Norton\u00e2(TM)s explicit mirror rant is where Barry Pepper and Phillip Seymour Hoffman have a very heated conversation about their friend in front of a window that shows Ground Zero in the background. It\u00e2(TM)s a five-minute one-shot scene where Barry Pepper throws out all his anger and frustration over Edward Norton\u00e2(TM)s predicament and the choices he made in life. It\u00e2(TM)s a very beautiful and moving scene.\nThe movie is about the choices you make and the life you lead and the consequences of your actions. Edward Norton plays Montgomery Brogan, a drug dealer recently nabbed by the Drug Enforcement Agency with ties to the Russian Mob, is celebrating his last day of freedom before he goes to jail for seven years in Otisville. He has many things he needs to do and needs to do them quick as the clock is ticking. He needs to have one last meal with his ex-fireman father and have drinks with his close friends outgoing investment banker Frank Slaughtery played by Barry Pepper and quiet dorky Jacob Elinsky played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman and girlfriend Naturelle played by Rosario Dawson, who may or may not have ratted him out to the DEA. Monty spends most of time thinking over the past and worried about his coming prison sentence. He feels that he will be beaten and raped in prison and feels apart from his girlfriend Naturelle. Jacob is going through his problems where he is feeling attracted to one of his English students played by True Blood star Anna Paquin. Frank is going through his own problems at work at his bank and also hurting over his friends prison sentence. He tries to pretend that he\u00e2(TM)s cool but inside he\u00e2(TM)s upset and feels his friend fucked up and deserves it. Brain Cox plays Monty\u00e2(TM)s father and he has love for his son and is not disappointed with his actions. At the end of the day Monty will go through many things that will result in a very powerful and moving ending. \nFirst off the writing is incredible. Well written and has good pacing. David Benioff wrote the script and adapted it from his own book. The acting is incredible and Edward Norton gives a great performance. He is very underrated in my opinion and doesn\u00e2(TM)t get much attention. I mean he has done some amazing movies like American History X, Fight Club, Red Dragon and Primal Fear. He\u00e2(TM)s a great actor. Barry Pepper is also great in this movie and he is also highly underrated as well. Phillip Seymour Hoffman shows why he\u00e2(TM)s always good at playing lovable losers. I think this was sort of his last loser kind of role and he\u00e2(TM)s gone off to play more dramatic roles like in Before the Devil knows Your Dead, Charlie Wilson\u00e2(TM)s War and Capote where he was awarded an Oscar. He is good in this and he\u00e2(TM)s also one of my favourite actors. The cinematography is brilliant and Spike Lee is really good with camera work and does very interesting camera angles. The music also adds to the powerful story. Jazz Musician Terence Blanchard offers a dramatic orchestral jazzy soundtrack that adds to the dramatic story line and gives the movie a very great atmosphere.\n25th hour is one of my favourite films and has all that a great film needs.

The premise evokes sympathy for the character even without seeing a single frame since the character's mind will be in a dreadful state awaiting what is to come. So it is all about how it is dealt. \r\nEdward Norton always comes across as a very decent actor but I have not come across his realized potential until this and American History X. The inevitable sentimental and pity moments are fresh because of a tremendous performance by Norton. The rest of the cast too gives their best to make this drama affecting and relatable. It has a stylish look as does most of Spike Lee's works along with Anna Paquin and Rosario Dawson looking their best ever. \r\nI felt the monologues were out of place and over the top too. The climax dream sequence is too stretched. But despite a couple of glitches, it is a great entertainer for it's premise without being too dark and gloomy which it could have easily been.",

That doesn't take away the great lines and the moments of brilliance, such as the very first scene and the scenes with the Drug Enforcement Agent officer. I love Philip Seymour Hoffman as an actor, but I really don't buy him in his role as one of Edward Norton's character's best friends.  Barry Pepper is far more believable.  Edward Norton is merely adequate in his role (With his angry rant in the bathroom, his intensity is nowhere near where it needs to be).

As the movie rolled on, the emotions kept on building and it reached a fever pitch. Backed up by some  superb acting by Edward Norton, Barry Pepper, Seymour Hoffman, Rosario Dawson and Brian Cox the team has created something which I've never seen before. Intense drama that covers the after-sentence life of a drug seller who is sentenced to 7 years in prison and has a day off with his best friends before starting his sentence. The friends share emotions, talk about how they would keep on supporting him and how they would plan to start up something after he gets out of the prison. The movie is completely different from the other crime-drama genre movies that've come before. It doesn't show the criminal persona of the person but shows how even a criminal like a drug seller has a human side to it. How his friends still support him and love him despite his bad past. The movie reflects the brighter side of such a person.\n\nA must watch for everybody who is into drama films and yeah ofcourse a fan of Edward Norton of the Fight Club fame ;)",

Much like Fight Club before it, his drug dealer protagonist is a disenfranchised outsider, critiquing the world he inhabits whilst never leaving the periphery. Judgmental, mistrustful and bitter: these are the words which define Norton's Monty Brogan as he goes through the many phases of pseudo-grief to which life shattering events are tied. In the space of his final 24 hours as a free man, Monty's emotional journey is never short of tumultuous, cursing everyone and everything in his life, unable to take relish in his borrowed time and whatever simple pleasures remain.\n\nThe 'fuck you!' men's room monologue, much acclaimed, marks the high point of Norton's performance and is undoubtedly deserving of it's notoriety.  Extensive, offensive and occasionally philosophical, a lesser talent would have milked it with forced aggression but Norton's quiet vitriol makes even the worst slander shine like gold...but then would you expect anything less from some one of Ed Norton's talent. \n\nThe film also sports great performances by Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Barry Pepper as Monty's 'friends', contemplating his destiny like the Fates of Greek myth, in spite of the fact that deep down they may be no better than he. Hoffman carries the biggest emotional challenge as Jacob, a tortured academic struggling to remain professional in the face of his own desires (manifested by schoolgirl seductress Anna Paquin); and Pepper makes for the kind of truly despicable success driven yuppie which would make Patrick Bateman look like a saint.  \n\nThe film is far from perfect though. Excellent performances aside, Lee's more artistic pretensions do tend to grate after a while. The slow motion nightclub confrontation between Paquin and Hoffman may look pretty but it runs for two long and feels too European for a gritty tale of life in urban America. Particularly given that this is a film about time and how effectively it is used. However, considering how this is a rare departure by the director from his usual black supremacy, this may (or may not) be easily forgivable.\n\nTo wit, 25 Hour is your basic tale of one man suffering a personal apocalypse, a common reflection of humanity in the modern world and a footnote to the best films of Norton's long string of exquisite performances. If anything is to be learned from the film it is to appreciate the time you have, and the people you know, because tomorrow everything could change and everything you know could end.",

If you were about to go to prison for an extended stretch, what would you do with your last day of freedom? It's a question most of us will never have to face, but as presented by Spike Lee in 25th Hour, the answers still prove compelling. Starring Edward Norton as a convicted drug dealer making a last-ditch effort to straighten out his personal life before being carted off to the pokey, 25th Hour delves into the sorts of complicated relationships that Lee thrives on; fathers and sons, friends from different backgrounds, and even good love gone wrong. And its rather messy blend of interpersonal dynamics was sweetened Lee's trippy camera work, a stellar supporting cast, and an epic monologue of raw power from Edward Norton in which he skewers all the city's residents before turning his ire on himself",

Through an intelligent screenplay, brilliant performances, and most of all, the direction by Spike Lee, one of the most talented filmmakers since Martin Scorsese. Lee often gets a bad rep due to his public cries and the idea that he makes films about race. Well, just see 25th Hour. 25th Hour is not about race relations in New York City. It's not about a man who does bad things and finds redemption. It's not about a man who destroyed himself. It's just about a person who made a mistake, and has to deal with it in the worst way. Through the period of a single day, and through what may appear to be arbitrary subplots, everything the audience needs to know about Norton's character is rendered in the least obvious, and most poignant of ways. He has done bad things, and he frankly deserves to go to prison, but the effect it has on him is demonstrated through one of the best character studies in movie history. Norton walks the streets of New York, running from one subplot to another, meandering around. Why? Because that's all he can do at this point. He can find the guy who sold him out. He can yell at the mirror in frustration. He can try to patch up relations with his father. He can hang out with or get mad at his friends. His friends commit crimes but go free while he is punished. And, just like the 9/11 metaphors at the corners of the film, nothing will ever be the same again. His situation is unfair, life-shattering, and there is nothing he can do about it. All he can do is meander and waste his time, as this time when life is as it is, will only last for 24 hours. Once he's gone, it's gone. And making it as bright as you can, trying to tie up lose ends, and learning about yourself isn't going to change it. Just like the city who's streets he walks on to waste time, nothing will be the same once its over.",

Sure, he can be a little overzealous and his politics can be stifling, but it's sort of tragic how he's seemingly more known for his controversial subject matter than he is for being an outstanding (and important) director. Indeed, he is one of very few who can simultaneously pull off being a sound visual stylist and a thorough storyteller. Next to Do The Right Thing, there may be no better example of this than 25th Hour.\n\nOne of the first American movies explicitly set in New York after 9/11, this film is based on a novel by David Benioff (who also wrote the screenplay) that was published well before the attacks. In any case, their aftermath is not so much the topic of Mr. Lee's movie as an important element of its atmosphere. In one of the film's most memorable scenes, two characters talk in an apartment overlooking ground zero, whose floodlighted glare and somber activity make it impossible to concentrate on the dialogue: a case of reality overwhelming fiction. There are also more subtle nods to the aftermath of those horrific events, but Lee smartly doesn't ovedo it; he uses the sociopolitical landscape of a post-9/11 America to great effect here, weaving it into the fabric of his story as a means to enhance, not distract.\n\nUndoubtedly, the show-stopping scene in the film is a moment when Monty (Edward Nortion), staring into a men's room mirror, launches into a profane tirade against his fellow New Yorkers (and everyone else). His rage is impressively ecumenical, encompassing blacks, brutal police officers, gays, Osama bin Laden, the rich, the poor and every other ethnic or social type you can think of: all of them put down with ruthless, scabrous precision. Obviously the sequence is very reminiscent of a similar scene in Do The Right Thing, but surprisingly, it's equally as effective here as it was back then (which could be viewed as a powerful statement on how little progress we've made over the years).\n\nOf course I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the brilliantly ambiguous ending. It is Lee's mission statement that this isn't a film about a plot, with a beginning, middle, and end. This is an imprint of the isolated times we live in. Who are we as a people? How do we define ourselves in relation to others? The whole film plays in a subdued, almost depressing tone. There are no laughs to be had, no falsely engineered moments where the characters break bread, and cry, and get all remorseful -- none of that. We feel as Monty feels: perplexed, distressed, unsure of those things to come and angry for how he happened to arrive at this place, and moment, in his life -- his last 25 hours.",

Spike Lee made this film, and if he read that, it would still blow his mind... or lead to my mind being blown, but, yeah, the point is that where Edward Norton's character in this film is going to prison, Norton himself is continuing his probation to apologize to minorities for all of the slurring he did in \"American History X\". I'd give him props for trying so hard that he got Rosario Dawson, the most racially ambiguous gal in the movie business before Zoe Saldana, to be his movie girlfriend, but he kind of took a few steps back in this film with a beautifully over-the-top, if overlong scene in which he bad-mouths virtually every ethnicity, and, just for good measure, Jesus. I just love that he was ranting to himself in the mirror, because it just goes to show you that even in this kind of film, Norton had to go split-personality on us, and considering that this is kind of like an \"American History X\" rip-off in a lot of ways, it is the ultimate Ed Norton fan service. To be a Spike Lee \"joint\", this film actually isn't that much about race relations, but you can still tell, based on this film's style, that this is either Lee making up for not making \"American History X\", or, well, solid evidence that Tony Kaye wishes he was the white Spike Lee. I don't know why, because \"American History X\" is awesome for having some blasted subtlety... emphasis on [u]some[/u] subtlety. Well, I don't know if it's because Lee doesn't have an agenda to push or whatever (This film is so not black that it doesn't have but one black guy, and reminded us that, as of 2002, Barry Pepper was still alive), but this is one strong joint (Get it?), even though it has some difficulty in staying subtle, even in the writing.\r\n\r\nCertain theatrical subtlety lapses reside even within the basic narrative concept of this film, which boasts a lot of gritty realism, and just as much, if not more melodramatics, with a histrionic romanticism of genuine subject matter whose fusion with audacity at least begets characters with questionable, maybe even unlikable aspects that go compensated by nuanced scripting and acting, but stressed by a lack of realization to the worthy, but melodramatic story concept. More than it is overblown with its dramatics, David Benioff's story is overblown with layers, all of which are worthy, but disjointed in their juggling, which takes too long to focus on secondary plotlines, before all but abandoning them, at least for a very long time, to snap back to the central focus, thus making for a messily uneven narrative that could handle its ultimately worthy workload if it was tighter. Clocking in at two hours and a quarter, this intimate film is hardly tight, with overlong dialogue and set pieces to accompany an overblown plot that thoroughly compels throughout its questionable course, but challenges your patience with an excessiveness that, as with most Spike Lee joints, is prominent in more than just story structuring. You can never predict just how much Lee will get carried away with or subdue his style, and in this, one of the best directorial performances of his entire career, he defines the film with an outstanding style that is often tight, but by no means consistently tight, getting overwrought with quick edits, ostensibly intentional jump cuts, awkward double-takes, and other heights in an overstylization that comes into play, to one extent or another, here and there throughout this flashy flick. I don't know if Lee ever so much manages to tightly blend style with substance, as much as he manages to draw a lot of substance in spite of the style, which is aesthetically dynamite, make no bones about it, but typically celebrated at the expense of substance, something that Lee isn't too much more delicate with, for although Benioff's script has its overwrought touches, the high intensity and sweeping resonance of Lee's directorial atmosphere don't always gel, being anything from unnerving to downright cheesy in its reflecting a noble and generally justified, but overt ambition. When the film is inspired, the impact ranges from penetrating to soaring, and although this is very, very likely Lee's magnum opus, it could have been truly outstanding if it wasn't for the excessiveness in the efforts of Lee and, for that matter, Benioff, because whether it be in its style or in its substance, the final product is an overblown mess more often than it should be if it's to be such an effective drama. Nevertheless, when the final product hits, it hits hard, and when it doesn't, it never falls flat, and much more often than it distances, it engrosses, as a strong triumph for Lee, both narratively and aesthetically.\r\n\r\nSpike Lee has a fine taste in light, yet distinct grain, and simultaneously grand and intimate framing to a visual style that he has still managed to get carried away with throughout a career filled with abrasive visuals and plays with technicality, but here, the look of the film is among the only elements of Lee's direction which are not overwrought at some point, thus, you're able to fully enjoy Rodrigo Prieto's utterly outstanding cinematography, which is impeccable in its combining subdued coloration and subtle lighting in an often dreamy manner which takes advantage of Lee's tastes to craft impacting visuals, whose beauty goes rivaled by equally, if not more outstanding musical style. Favored score composer for Spike Lee Terence Blanchard is virtuously well-versed in both jazz and opera-scale classical, and in this minimalist, modernist urban drama, Blanchard decides to go with the latter style, whose extreme sweep and sophistication occasionally exacerbate the overblown subtlety issues of the directorial storytelling, but is extremely original in its ambitious, potentially awkward placement in the context of subject matter which is conceptually light in scale, justified by beautifully stellar and sweepingly dynamic compositions which, when used correctly, draw upon the depths of this layered affair with such a magnitude that it establishes a sense of scope, and therefore plays a major part in making the final product so rewarding as a spirited interpretation of an actually intimate story concept. Melodramatic in concept, and excessive in its uneven and overdrawn interpretation, David Benioff's story is ambitious, and worthy, with themes regarding the vulnerability of man being found within arguably expendable, but inarguably compelling subplots which back up a central plot about a good, but flawed man facing up to his misdeeds that is rich with the dramatic potential of an outstanding drama, made, at the very least, strong by generally solid storytelling, particularly within the writing. As one might expect, most of the subtlety issues of this film derive from Lee's storytelling efforts, although Benioff's script has its overwrought aspects which extend well beyond an excessive and focally uneven plot structure, and yet, on the whole, a lot of the film's effectiveness thrives on its featuring such an outstanding script, whose characterization is thorough in its distinguishing questionable, but ultimately endearing and richly nuanced roles, whose dialogue has moments of overt obscenity, even more moments of improbably theatrical snap, and plenty of moments of excessiveness, made forgivable more often than not by often amazingly crackling wit that often has to be heard in order to be believed, just as many - dare I say - brilliantly memorable scenes - from the should-be iconic bathroom mirror rant sequence, and a heartbreaking beating sequence, to an ending which may inspired mixed emotions, but has to be admired for its edge - of utterly mesmerizing ambition have to be seen in order to be believed, and generally presented with a great deal of respect by Lee. Lee is as ambitious as he can be in his approach to most every aspect of this project, and he's not as good a filmmaker as a film like this deserves, thus, you're faced with overstylization and some glaring subtlety issues, but for only so long, because through snappy, if overdone plays on Barry Alexander Brown's editing, haunting visuals, and so on and so forth, Lee delivers on enough tight style to highlight consistent entertainment value, and through moments of realization to the placement of theatrical atmospherics, and of, of all things, subtle thoughtfulness which inspire tension and sometimes tear-jerking resonance, which grows more and more recurrent as the film unravels, until you come to latter acts which are as outstanding as this film could have and maybe should have been throughout its course. As of 2014, I have still not completed Lee's filmography, but quite frankly, I can't see Lee topping this performance, whose missteps are notable, and instrumental in holding a potentially outstanding film back to some degree, but whose highlights are aesthetically, entertainingly and dramatically powerful, almost masterful, and yet, the true driving force of this film is the onscreen performances, because this is one of those cases in which every single performance that is brought under the spotlight has a time to shine, with such relatively minor performers as the convincingly hot-headed Anna Paquin, charming Tony Siragusa, briefly present, but intensely effective Levan Uchaneishvili, and subtly solid Brian Cox driving some memorable moments, while the leads really breathe life into this drama, whether it be Rosario Dawson as a strong-willed, but ultimately woman who must watch her love face prison time, or Philip Seymour Hoffman as a good and morally sound man whose exposure to risky business may corrupt his good sense, or the show-stealingly emotive and layered Barry Pepper as a successful man of overwhelming pride which will go challenged by an even more intense, gradually exacerbating guilt over the downfall of a friend, portrayed with predictable impeccability by leading man Edward Norton, who defies limitations in material to remind us of his being one of the greatest actors alive through a flawless charisma and dramatic nuance which allow him to easily embody a typical, but nonetheless distinguished role with intensity, grace and, most of all, humanity. We all know and love Derek Vinyard of \"American History X\", the \"nameless\" protagonist of \"Fight Club\", and maybe even Aaron Stampler of the otherwise forgettable \"Primal Fear\", and Norton strikes again in his making the Montgomery \"Monty\" Brogan character memorable, as well as compelling in the context of this story, as a highlight in a drama full of highlights, as well as enough misguidance for the final product to fall short of an outstanding state that it manages to flirt with enough to stand as Lee's relative masterpiece, and as a strong film by its own right.\r\n\r\nOnce the final hour has passed, the film finds itself held back by its own ambitions, - which lead to melodramatics, focal unevenness, a problematic length, overbearing overstylization, and some cloying subtlety issues - but only just shy of excellence, found in a respectable quantity within the gorgeous cinematography, phenomenal score work, compelling subject matter, richly nuanced and cracklingly clever writing, aesthetically colorful and dramatically powerful direction, and cast full of memorable performances - especially by Barry Pepper and, of course, Edward Norton - which make Spike Lee's \"25th Hour\" a very strong and occasionally glowing portrait on the vulnerability of man and the hardships and beauty of life.\r\n\r\n3.25/5 - Strong",

            "content": "During the early to mid-1990's Spike Lee was a director who could do no wrong in my eyes. His films were of a very high calibre and then he hit a dip in form, seemingly never recovering. This however, was a reminder of how good he can be.\n Based on the novel by David Benioff - who also wrote the screenplay, it tells the story of Monty Brogan (Edward Norton) a Manhattan drug dealer who has to confront the choices he has made in life on his last day before serving a seven-year prison sentence. He spends his last 24hours of freedom with his girlfriend Naturelle (Rosario Dawson) his father (Brian Cox) and his two best friends Frank (Barry Pepper) and Jake (Philip Seymour Hoffman), all the while determining who really sold him out.\n This is a Spike Lee \"joint\" I don't mind taking a hit off, at all. Filled with very intense and dramatic conversations and confrontations between the characters, delivered with superb performances. Norton and Hoffman have already cemented their reputations but Pepper is a highly under-rated actor that I predict will be winning awards very soon with the quality he consistantly delivers. It's a real joy to watch them bounce off each other, adding real gravitas to some well written dialogue. Lee's direction is also up close and personal, giving it a further sense of realism. The post 9/11 psyche of New Yorkers is a running theme throughout and even one scene has two characters overlooking ground-zero as they discuss the end of an era. Lee also explores the multi-cultural diversity of the city, like he has done previously in \"Do The Right Thing\" and \"Jungle Fever\", among others. The diversity is also played out in the three friends, with very different values. It's an ambitious film with nearly every other scene or character, subtly displaying metaphor for the fragile state of the city they inhabit.   \n Despite a running time that slightly overstays it's welcome, this is a highly charged and thought-provoking allegory of capitalist America and boasts three superlative, indefatigable performances from Norton, Pepper & Hoffman.",

The story structure is extremely original and the characters are introduced in such a perfect way that it makes you question why it's not more highly regarded. Edward Norton always throws in his all, but this is truly his most introverted character. While he might not say all that much, we can always see what is going on in his head.

I personally expected something more out of the whole last night of freedom plot line, but all you really get is a subtle drama that just moves along. With that said Edward Norton continues to give us A list performances and to me is one of the most under-appreciated actors going today. Rosario Dawson is more sexy then usual, maybe it's because she was in her element, but she puts out a bit of a mellow-performance. Barry Pepper and Philip-Seymour Hoffman do an alright, but nothing like some of their more dramatic performances in other films.

It's easily one of the better films I've seen in a while.\r\n\r\nI'm not a huge Spike Lee fan, but I loved Do the Right Thing and The Inside Man. I'm not sure if there is any other director whose love for his city is more apparent in their films than Spike Lee. He really does love New York and that love shines through in almost every frame of 25th Hour.\r\n\r\nThat being said, Lee uses the New York backdrop in a very subtle way. The film never turns into a love letter to NYC. Lee is also very classy with the way he deals with the aftermath of 9/11. \r\n\r\nThe 25th Hour includes some solid acting performances from some of today's greatest actors including Ed Norton who plays Monty Brogan, a drug dealer who is about to go to prison.\r\n\r\nThe film follows Monty around town on the night before he goes to jail. He's accompanied by his friends played by Pepper and Hoffman.\r\n\r\nThe film is very much about making choices and how one bad decision can change your life forever. Monty has clearly made some bad choices that have landed him in the situation he is in. At the same time, Hoffman is battling with his feelings for his underage student. He's struggling with urges that he's not sure he can suppress. Making the wrong choice could land him in jail like his friend.\r\n\r\nThe 25th Hour is very much a character study. The plot isn't overly complex and the story doesn't progress like your typical Hollywood film.\r\n\r\nAll in all, the 25th Hour is a haunting portrayal of a broken man (and city) who is hours away from hitting rock bottom.",

Monty settles all of his business and inevitably goes on to prison with his father driving him there.\n\nFantastic film that ranks up alongside Do the Right Thing and Malcolm X as Spike Lee's best films. The way he uses the very recent 9/11 event as an undertone of the way the main character feels about the state that the city is in is magnificent. The f*** you monologue was just as brilliant as the similar scene from Lee's earlier Do the Right Thing. The film takes its time throughout its run time but there isn't a moment wasted in the film. Spike Lee is one of the few great directors around that uses very straightforward narratives and styles yet he puts his trademark touches. The gliding dolly shot as Philip Seyour Hoffman walks out of the club bathroom was an awesome shot. Like Do the Right Thing, there is no real plot in the typical sense. It's just a day in the life of a man, this man just happens to be a drug dealer going to prison for his sins. It is a movie that certainly reflects the whole New York state of mind. One of the best films of the last 10 years. 10/10",

The film now follows Brogan and all of his activities for his day of freedom before jail...\r\n\r\nThe film's story had the slowest start to begin but once it picked up, it did a good job of keeping me watching. The story also had random sub plots that I felt weren't really needed but if you can bare with them, you'll enjoy the film. I also can understand what everyone means when they bring up Lee's constant unneeded subtle reminders of racism in his films. If you're willing to overlook that fact, the story is still quite an emotional ride and has some really memorable scenes. \r\n\r\nThe idea of the film was great but sadly, the execution could have used work. Though not perfect, the script was still good. The film still manages to capture the raw emotions of a drug dealer who just wants out. The story is structured good enough to the point that you truly feel the walls of time closing in on you. You got front row seats to spend Monty's last day as a free man thanks to the script.\r\n\r\nThe film's camera work gets nothing but love. The angles definitely came in with the assist to help capture the raw emotions. Also, the film's character development was quite entertaining. The film gives you a proper introduction of each of Monty's loved ones but somewhat leaves me still feeling short handed on Monty.\r\n\r\nThe acting was great. Every film that Norton is in, he always pumps out a 200% performance so it's not a shock he's still a powerhouse of an actor. Another key player in the acting department was, Barry Pepper. His performance kept up with Norton's. You truly felt Pepper's remorse and anger for his friend going away. Though the rest of the supporting cast was great too, Pepper and Norton's performances left a huge shadow over everyone else for me.\r\n\r\nOverall, The film takes fire for uneven pacing and not enough focusing on Monty and as we've all heard, Lee's usual preachy antics. Regardless, the film bounces back thanks to an astounding cast and their heartfelt performances.The film still finds a way of getting you emotionally attached and definitely shows that Spike Lee's still got some ideas in him. This deserves a watch at the least!!!\r\n\r\n\r\nWade-O-Meter: 74%--->70%",

The emotional interaction between Monty, Jacob, and Frank is powerful, but it's at its best when only Frank and Jacob are talking, pondering Monty's fate and what will become of themselves as well. Pepper (who probably took this role to prove he could still act after the bloated monstrosity that was \"Battlefield: Earth\") has never been better, and Hoffman lends sterling support to the duo's yin-yang. \n\nThough Norton achieves one of his own career highpoints thanks to a rage-filled monologue in a restaurant bathroom (echoing \"Catcher in the Rye\"), it can hardly compete with a superior speech from Cox about what his son could do to escape his fate. \n\n\"25th Hour\" is also one of the few films to use post-9/11 New York as a fairly effective metaphor for the scars of the protagonists.

            "content": "25th Hour, Great Movies\nFor myself, watching *25th Hour* was sort-of like taking a palm reading. Noticing one line, representative of a life-path, stretches out long and far, while another line branches off and stops short in the middle of your palm. You question which life path will you take, and which are you currently on now. Are you one the short one or the long one? You question the various choices and decisions that you made in the past, and which life-line have those choices and decisions ultimately lead you down. In a round-about way, the three characters in Spike Lee's 25th Hour are struggling with these same kind of questions. The film is essentially about three people struggling with the choices that they have made in their past, and the choices they are to make in the future and which path will it ultimately lead them down. Edward Norton stars as Monty Brogan, a man whose life decision, becoming a drug dealer, has left him facing a seven year prison term. It's the morning before, and Monty has twenty-five hours left to examine his life, bond with his closest friends, say goodbye to family, find a home for his dog, and figure out a way to survive in the joint. At one point, Monty's friend refers to his incarceration, as \"...going to hell and never coming back,\" and the audience gets the feeling that it's not just a coy metaphor. If Monty does survive his \"time\", he will most assuredly not be the person they once knew when he gets out. Even though he has grown distant from them over the years, Monty chooses to spend his remaining hours with his closest friends from childhood, Jacob Elinsky (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and Frank Slaughtery (Barry Pepper). Socially and economically, these are two of the most dissimilar people one is likely to see spending time together in a film. Their only real connection is the deeply entrenched devotion they feel to their friend. Jacob is a nerdy English teacher, whose gift for the language, has done little for his social skills. His self-doubt and shame for being born wealthy has left him single, lonely and in a thankless job. He desperately yearns for one of his students, a beautiful and precocious seventeen year old, Mary D'Annunzio (Anna Paquin), but is afraid to act on it, fearful that such a decision will lead to him being fired from his job, or even worse, arrested. Frank, on the other hand, is on the opposite end of the character spectrum, he's a good-looking, rich Wall Street trader, who, unlike, his nebbish friend, has never had a problem with the ladies. Also unlike Jacob, Frank is much more forthright in his feelings about life, and his friend's impending incarceration, \"He profited from other's misery and he deserves what he gets,\" he tells Jacob. Norton's character also has a girlfriend, Naturelle, played by Rosario Dawson, whom he believes might have been the one who sold him out to the police. There's also his father, played by Brian Cox, a retired fireman who owns a bar on Staten Island which caters primarily to fire fighters. Each of these people, in their own way, blames them self for what is happening to Monty. The story propels forward when the three childhood friends gather in a nightclub, with Jacob's student, Mary, and Monty's girlfriend, Naturelle, tagging along. It is what happens in this club, on this night, that provides the core of the movie. The accusations that are made, the favor that is asked, the choices that are acted upon, and the truth that is revealed, will stay with these characters long after the 25th hour has widdled and gone away. Will these friends be willing to enact Doyle's Law, in a figurative sense, and save Monty Brogan, the symbolic beaten dog? 25th Hour is also memorable for grappling openly with the aftermath of September 11th. Lee skillfully immerses it into the subtext of the story. Referenced in pictures of fire fighters who lost their lives at the World Trade Center, which adorn the walls of the local sports bar and the uptown offices of the traders; to the mention of Bin Laden in a particularly biting commentary by Monty; to Frank Slaughtery's defiant refusal to move from his apartment, which sits overlooking the ruins of the Twin Towers. Director Spike Lee, never known for being subtle, thrusts these images, and his obvious anger about it, into the viewers lap and compels them to deal with it. Also memorable is the venomous diatribe by Norton into a bathroom mirror, where he verbally attacks every group in New York regardless of ethnicity, sexual preference or socioeconomic standing. Not even the church or JC himself, is safe from his tirade, which ends when Monty realizes the only person he has to blame for his predicament, is the one staring back at him in the mirror. The whole film plays in a subdued, almost depressing, tone. There are no laughs to be had, no falsely engineered moments where the characters break bread, and cry, and get all remorseful, none of that. We feel as Monty feels: perplexed, distressed, unsure of those things to come and angry for how he happened to arrive at this place, and moment, in his life, his last 25 hours.",

            "content": "One of the recurring themes in this film is how people will suffer the consequences for their mistakes - their greed, their lust, and their naivete.  We learn that in another life, Edward Norton's character capitalized on the misfortune of others, yet in the first scene he takes a risk just to save a dying dog's life.  I really liked how this movie didn't focus on redeeming oneself after a life of crime, but instead dealt with the acceptance of the grim reality that follows after being caught, especially because his character is a good person and has a kind heart; he just got too involved with the wrong people and didn't know when to quit.  The ending sequence is very cleverly done and further proves the point that there is no realistic way to run away from punishment.\n\nAnd, of course, Edward Norton is brilliant as usual.  So it's a damn good movie.",

It's a unique film in that plot is based around a drug dealer without ever showing the dead; instead it focuses entirely on the aftermath. Edward Norton plays the convicted dealer who has 25 hours left of freedom before he must go to jail and serve his term. He spends the ensuing 25 hours trying to sort out his life and get some sort of redemption before serving his time.\n\nIt's a powerful film, once scene particular has Norton saying a Monologue in front of a mirror about the state of New York and life that is a really great scene. The script is excellent, as is the great cast including Brian Cox and the underrated Barry Pepper. The pace can be a little slow at times but it's very much a thinking person?s drama with many subtle messages throughout. The ending is perfect and will leave you with a slight happy feeling.\n\n25th Hour is an excellent film that should be seen by all.",

            "content": "A lot of people don't care to give Spike Lee a chance as a filmmaker, primarily because much of his political opinions, are admittedly nauseating and tiring and I am certain many people think this mentality will remain a strong part of his work.  What is interesting about Lee is how his films are really honest, and even at times sensitive films that happen to be filmed in a brutal manner.  The 25th Hour is about a morally devoid drug dealer Monty Brogan (Edward Norton in a great performance that looks effectively exhausted and weighed down by his own demons) who spends his last 24 hours among the people closest to him (most of whom he's been gradually pushing away) before he must serve a prison term for his actions.  Monty's journey in the film makes for a terrific story:  it is the tale of a man who must come to terms with his mistakes and who in the span of 24 hours must attempt to rekindle the human connections with those he blocked out or risk the possibility of feeling alone and isolated in his final moments before prison.  I like how smooth the film transitions the character:  in one of the best scenes of the film early on Monty is chastising Enron, police, and every other group he feels should be held responsible for their despicable actions, spitting scathing profane bile at each one of these institutions, feeling as if he is enlightened to their true lack of decency.  What is great about the scene is that whether Monty is correct or not about their guilt is irrelevant;  it instead is a brilliant depiction of how Monty is looking for any person or institution to place blame upon besides himself.  And at the start of the film Monty tries to hide behind anything he can to not really except responsibility or feel truly sorry for his behavior.  Yet as the movie progresses Monty has to become more and more aware of what his actions have done and the pain his imprisonment will ultimately cause those around him.  Spike is none as a director who incites unrest and is severely radical, which isn't necessarily untrue, but the truth is in some instances such as this one, he can also craft a harsh morality tale that is made stronger by its virtuoso filmmaking.",

I drove out west with your mother one time, before you was born. Brooklyn to the Pacific in three days. Just enough money for gas, sandwiches, and coffee, but we made it. Every man, woman, and child alive should see the desert one time before they die. Nothin' at all for miles around. Nothin' but sand and rocks and cactus and blue sky. Not a soul in sight. No sirens. No car alarms. Nobody honkin' atcha. No madmen cursin' or pissin' in the streets. You find the silence out there, you find the peace. You can find God. So we drive west, keep driving till we find a nice little town. These towns out in the desert, you know why they got there? People wanted to get way from somewhere else. The desert's for startin' over. Find a bar and I'll buy us drinks. I haven't had a drink in two years, but I'll have one with you, one last whisky with my boy. Take our time with it, taste the barley, let it linger. And then I'll go. I'll tell you don't ever write me, don't ever visit, I'll tell you I believe in God's kingdom and I'll see you and your mother again, but not in this lifetime. You'll get a job somewhere, a job that pays cash, a boss who doesn't ask questions, and you make a new life and you never come back. Monty, people like you, it's a gift, you'll make friends wherever you go. You're going to work hard, you're going to keep your head down and your mouth shut. You're going to make yourself a new home out there. You're a New Yorker, that won't ever change. You got New York in your bones. Spend the rest of your life out west but you're still a New Yorker. You'll miss your friends, you'll miss your dog, but you're strong. You got your mother's backbone in you, you're strong like she was. You find the right people, and you get yourself papers, a driver's license. You forget your old life, you can't come back, you can't call, you can't write. You never look back. You make a new life for yourself and you live it, you hear me? You live your live the way it should have been. But maybe, this is dangerous, but maybe after a few years you send word to Naturelle. You get yourself a new family and you raise them right, you hear me? Give them a good life, Monty. Give them what they need. You have a son, maybe you name him James, it's a good strong name, and maybe one day years from now years after I'm dead and gone reunited with your dear ma, you gather your whole family around and tell them the truth, who you are, where you come from, you tell them the whole story. Then you ask them if they know how lucky there are to be there. It all came so close to never happening. This life came so close to never happening. \r\n\r\nNaturelle Riviera: One minute ago, you were my friend. Are you drunk? Tell me you've been drinking too much. You're fucking drunk. \r\nFrank Slaughtery: I'm Irish. I can't get drunk, all right?

Gucci, Prada, YSL... You can pick out what you want... because everybody knows your boyfriend, and everyone owes him a favor. \r\nJakob Elinsky: Sway is walking into the best five-star restaurant in the city, without a reservation, and being seated... right away. \r\nFrank Slaughtery: Sway? Ha ha ha. That's making a phone call in the morning, and having courtside seats, Madison Square Garden, that evening. Lakers vs. Knicks, Kobe and Shizzaq in the hizzouse! \r\nMary D'Annunzio: Sway is entering a club through the staff entrance, so you can skip the line, the cover charge... and the metal detector. \r\nMonty Brogan: Sway is locking eyes with an undercover cop on the subway.

This is a drama at the lowest form in terms of context. The situations and story the character's revolve around isn't necessarily cut out to be considered your typical drama film. Which is what makes this movie so different. Ed Norton I believe is at his best in this movie. He has such a tame, yet balled-up angry persona we can truly feel his emotions when he shares them in a 5 minute reflection. Norton's soliloquy consists mainly of \"dissing\" everyone in NYC. I don't know about you but that takes courage and balls. Courage to stand up to the filth he sees in NYC, and Balls to say it.

Though the film contains many emotionally disquieting moments, the one scene I particularly admire because of its honesty is the exchange between Frank(Barry Pepper) and Jacob(Philip Seymour Hoffman) on how, after that very night, everything will never be the same again, how they could not invite Monty for a drink and reminisce of better times. \"25th Hour\" is not a film that carries out the nature of guilt, but it is about regret, of what could have been a better life.",

            "content": "Viewing back at Spike Lee's \"25th Hour\" is one of his best made films. \"25th Hour\" came out a year later in 2002 when much of America was still grieving after the terrorist attacks of Sept 11 2001. Spike Lee loves New York. It's in his bones and \"25th Hour\" is no exception. This film is probaly one of his most personal pictures he has made. The directing, writing, cinematography, the use of camera angles and movements, to the cast, and polished editing is first rate. \r\n\r\nThe story: It is Monty Brogan's (Edward Norton) last day of freedom before he begins serving a 7 year long sentence for dealing drugs. He plans to spend his last night of freedom at a club with his childhood friends Jacob Elinsky (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and Frank Slaughtery (Barry Pepper), his girlfriend Naturelle (Rosario Dawson), and his father, James (Brian Cox). Frank, his best friend since they were both three, is an investment banker on Wall Street. Jacob is a quiet, dorky high school teacher who comes from a privileged background.\r\n\r\nMonty sells drugs for a Russian mobster (What is it with me and Russian mobsters lately?), along with his partner Kostya. Kostya tells Monty it might have been Naturelle, who lives with Monty and knows where he hid his drugs and money, who tipped the cops. At multiple viewings I did not understand what these characters were up against and the personal sins they had to reedeem. The plot of \"25th Hour\" kinda reminds me of Clint Eastwood's great film \"Mystic River\" or maybe not. \r\n\r\nPersonally I did not having any feelings for the Ed Norton character due to the fact that he was selling drugs and living very rich from those who suffered or even died from his strong naracotics. Yet by watching this again Norton's character clearly knows the situations he is up against, is a good guy but should have gotten out sooner. The last scenes of the picture is very important because it is Lee's way of displaying instant pennance to a drug dealer who basically sinned. \r\n\r\n\"25th Hour\" is a strong, passionate film about the choices people make and the dire consequences they will sadly regret. America is paying the price thanks to Sept 11 (which this story is set) is also no exception. This is a great picure.\r\n\r\nP.S. - Special notice to Rosario Dawson's performance as Monty Brogan's girlfriend Naturalle. It is one of her best performance and reminiscent to another great performance she portrayed of Ray Allen's girlfriend in Lee's \"He Got Game\".",

Spike Lee explores that great question in the 25th Hour.\r\n\r\nEdward Norton plays the part to a \"T.\" A truly great actor that can really sink deep into his roles.  Extremely entertaining throughout.  This is also one of, if not the first movie to be shot in NYC right after 9/11.  Spike Lee adds that in and it plays a part in the feelings of Monte. The theme of reflection is brought to the surface throughout the whole movie. It's a movie that makes you think before you act and who your real friends are.",

            "content": "10/10 - It's been a while since I have been so deeply affected by a film as I was tonight. There's something about films that take place in the space of a 24 hour time period that connect with me on an emotional level; maybe it's the aspect of how short 24 hours can be, yet so important. Usually in these movies, there is hope in the end, and the protagonist walks away, maybe on a hangover, into the bluish haze of the dawn to a new day, a better future. In Marty's (Edward Norton) case, when the sun rises, his life is over for seven years. \r\n\r\nWhen you have one night to spend before you go to prison, how will you spend it? The film makes it clear through dialogue that Marty isn't exactly prison material, and he may be better off ending his life before it turns into a living hell. There is no grand, daring getaway where Marty defeats the system and drives off into the sunset, only dreams or the illusion of dreams and the quiet words of friends who are close to him. Seven years is a long time, longer than I care to imagine.\r\n\r\nSpike Lee does his usual thing here: You know, the floating shots and whatnot. His style doesn't hinder the effectiveness of Marty's final hours though, rather, it helps accentuate the side story, that of New York post 9-11. In the film's most avant garde and profane scene, Marty's mind begins to rant and cuss out all who inhabit New York and what it stands for, from Puerto Ricans to Osama Bin Laden to Jesus Christ himself. His city is what he loves, and in that moment he has to tear it apart and burn it to the ground. His life is nearing its end for a while, just as New York is starting over.\r\n\r\nThe 25th hour is a great film.",
