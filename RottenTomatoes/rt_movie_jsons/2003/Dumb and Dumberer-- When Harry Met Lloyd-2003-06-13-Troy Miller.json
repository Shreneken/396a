The two actors try their best to recapture the charm of Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels and Eugene Levy is decent but it never has the insanely funny approach of the 1994 classic. It has a thin, predictable plot and more than half of the time the jokes were mostly cringey. Yes, I know I shouldn't expect some very witty dialogue from a movie called Dumb and Dumberer but even the sequel had some laugh-out-loud humour. While I'm mostly into dumb comedies since I'm a bit of an Adam Sandler fanboy and laughed my ass off at a couple of Seth Rogen movies, this one was a disappointment.

        {
            "content": "After seeing this I still believe that the first one was a product of its time that everybody loves because of nostalgia because this movie is actually pretty accurately made to fit in with the first one. Even though it's clear what the general consensus is with this movie, it doesn't feel like a quick cash grab to just cash in on the popularity of the original and actually has a few throwbacks to the original, some more obvious than others. And this movie actually has the added bonus of providing a scene that I laughed harder at than anything in the first movie.\n\nNow, saying that doesn't mean I like the movie and it's a blessing and a curse at the same time. While the tone and humor is similar to that of the first to fit in with the timeline and characters, it also means that I didn't really laugh a lot either. I noticed I had a few more chuckles sprinkled throughout this time but that's because of the references to the first and the little jabs here and there at certain things, the joke about doing nothing and fitting in, in America made me smile. The scene that I laughed at though I thought would raise the score up a little but nothing else like that happened again and the joke happened a little too early in the movie. The reaction one character has to something that happens in their bathroom had me laughing a lot, his reaction was what made it funny, it's a gag joke a little different from the rest. Even the dream sequence was better in this movie, it was more creative and just as soon as I thought it was going on too long, it finished! Which is unlike the other movie. The movie also has the problem that was in the first with someone saying a joke and cutting away seconds after they say it, it didn't happen that often but it was still there. Also, the opening credits were funny again, woo, and it even has 'Joon 13' on the cover.\n\nI think the actors that played Harry and Lloyd were well chosen, they looked the part and acted like a young Harry and Lloyd would, they were written the same way and acted the same way, it's believable and well done. The plot was also like the one from the first movie, things just keep going wrong for our characters who are always in the wrong place at the wrong time and totally oblivious to what's going on. The side characters were good, especially the ones in the 'special class' even if they weren't used as much as I would have liked and Eugene Levy is always there for a good laugh, even if he wasn't as funny like he usually is but it was probably the script, you can only do so much. And some of the acting isn't the best either. It also does have some very odd cameos.\n\nWhile I've said it fits in with the previous movie, it did feel quite cheap which is probably where some of the criticism comes from but hey, at least it's short. Dumb & Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd might not be that great, it is much like the first movie and it's harmless and you even find out how Lloyd chipped his tooth. It's innocent enough and once again has likeable characters in the lead but it's clear what everyone else thinks. Some call it pointless and even though I thought that a few times, when you get right down to it, every movie is pointless. I personally don't think it's the monstrosity that the majority seem to think it is but that's just the beauty of an opinion, it's not a masterpiece but neither was the original and hey for what it's worth, this one actually made me laugh.",

Set in their carefree high school days in 1986, Harry and Lloyd become the unwitting pawns of a corrupt principle who's attempting to embezzle state funds by creating a fake \"Special Needs\" class.  Featuring Eric Christian Olsen, Rachel Nichols, Eugene Levy, and Shia LaBeouf, the casting is pretty good; Olsen in particular does a great job at emulating Jim Carrey's performance from the original.  And the comedy is well-written, staying true to the first film and offering several homages.  Still, the film tries a little too hard to be like the original and doesn't quite have the same spirit.  Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd is fun and entertaining, but it plays things kind of safe and sticks to a standard high school comedy formula.",

The two lead actors are quite convincing in their stupidity and you will find yourself laughing at a few jokes but overall it lacks the typical touch of the Farrelly brothers who have a special knack to portray uncanny characters in silly situations and write excellent jokes.",

There were a few funny parts and then the \"really?\" parts. Compared to the 1st movie, the actors who played Lloyd and Harry were a lot dumber than Carrey and Daniels. I get that they're supposed to be dumb, but at least the original showed that they were still somewhat smart on their moves. As for making a prequel, I think it was just only on how to show how they became friends, but they could've done that with a sequel with putting in a flashback. \n\nD+",
