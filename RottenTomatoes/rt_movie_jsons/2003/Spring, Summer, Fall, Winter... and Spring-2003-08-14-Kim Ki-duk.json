Told in five chapters, a young boy is raised by an aging monk and taught about life through the eyes of a Buddhist.  Sparse on dialogue, the movie tells its tale primarily through visuals.  The cinematography is stunning throughout and, more often than not, the story is told through the facial expressions and actions of the actors.  Despite its many attributes, a word of warning is warranted: those not familiar with Buddhism may miss some of the finer points of the movie, so a quick primer would be recommended in order to at least partially understand what the film is driving at.",

            "content": "I write this remark, virtually the first time doing so on a website, as I strongly felt like I should.\n\nI am a Korean and I was basically born and raised in the religion of Buddhism, although the religion does not have that much interaction with someone's personal life compared to other major religions, at least here in South Korea. \nSo I have a bit better understanding of what the movie is talking about, or what the Director's put into the movie, in terms of the notions he's trying to covey. (Just to add, my religion is not Buddhism at the moment.)\n\nI dunno whether it is because the Director passed away (from COVID infection in a 3rd world country where he located himself after sexual abuse allegations) as a consequence of what he is alledged to have done, I find the imagerys on the film to have made and put overly sexual than how it would have been in real life if something like the beggining of the plot had occured in real life.\n \nI think the choices of the clothings of the woman were projections of the director's, kind of, fetish. Well, it itself is not immoral or whatever, but I just don't buy projecting his thing--more specifically letting the character wear sexy clothings that the moviemaker likes, or has in mind, into the situation where it simply does not match.\n\nMore specifically, when someone sends her sick daughter to a Buddhist temple in a deep mountain, and the daughter is physically sick, one wouldn't wear or bring a tight skirt or dress. It's basically the very basic culture of South Korea, taken for granted for almost anybody who has ever been to a temple (especially back in early 2000s, when the culture was more conservative) that one would not wear a kind of clothing that just feels like it does not go with all the deep mountains and wooden temples and religion devoting monks. And for me, knowing how it really is, and was like, deciding to make the plot to put that white tight dress on the ill lady in the temple in the deep mountain was a big no-go. \n\nThe plot develops further from that item, and it just breakes the integrity of the movie since it does not really much portray or fails to give sone kind of imformation on the real world. \nAnd speaking of which, what's with sudden appearance of the school uniform? For a moment I thought the woman still had to go to school but that wasn't the case. Is this another personal desire making its wrong apperance onto the screen? I wonder.\n\nPlus, I find not appropriate and not going together with the ture teaching and values of them to mankind, of making the monk have super-human power of pulling the boat just by staring at it. As I understand, the values and teachings of Buddhism is on seeing through the actual meanings of materials and things and pursuits in the world. So that people won't have to go though void pains and sufferings. \nSomehow believing monks having some sort of superpower is also a thing believed by some crowds, much less in recent times though, in South Korea, and I haven't seen that belief adding any positive values to anybody. Just only mis-notions.\nLastly, from reading some books that I have read in what the Buddhist religion is trying to give to humanity, I have no idea and I do not think that it should be the case that the old monk burns himself in the middle of a deep mountian-which in other words would be punishing himself; killing himself. \n\nThere is in history, where monks set himslef on fire and dying to achieve a certain purpose. This is nowhere encouraged in any book of Buddhism as far as I know; but after so many years you can think of what their true purpose was and what the happening actually brought to the world. It makes you think a lot, but one thing that is certain is that none of them were to punish himself. And personally, I reckon that, what the moviemakers put on the film is wrong. And this wrong notion could have resulted in wrongful thoughts that led to self-killing that actually took place in this country. This is wrong and one should think carefully before projecting this kind of thing into a could-be-widespread medium.\n\nPeople who haven't seen or faced much of oriental culture or the scenes (cultural images and the scenes of nature) might be positively moved by such images on the film.\nBut they are the creation of the culture and nature itself; well-putting those images onto the film is a good thing but one should't confuse and make the mistake of good images of such things in the film leading to valuing the ideas and notions of the director, put inside the movie as good.",

            "content": "Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...And Spring is something that is far greater than just being a film. No, it transcends the film barrier and the art barrier, and crosses over into an experience. Much like an experience, it's one of those things that you have to see to really understand, as simply talking about it will never do it proper justice. Hell, even when I give it 5 stars and even the fact that I will say that it is one of the greatest films I've ever seen simply isn't enough to put into proper context just how amazing an experience it is in watching it.\n\nThe plot is deceptively simple on its exterior: at a small Buddhist monastery on a lake in the middle of the wilderness live two monks. One is an older man who is wise, and the younger one is his protege who falls in a number of pitfalls as many young people do from lack of experience, but his master tries to guide him not only in the ways of being a Buddhist monk, but also through life. The film follows their lives through the course of several years and changing seasons. While I want to go into greater detail with the plot, that would spoil the film, and would rather not do that to someone who might consider watching it because there is so much more lurking beneath that simple plot summary.\n\nMuch like other films in Kim Ki-Duk's filmography, this one is rather quiet, contemplative, and meditative, while also sporting a deceptively simple plot that hides a great deal more than what it shows on the surface as there are a number of themes, ideas, and mysterious elements waiting for the viewer to process and dissect the meanings of, as Kim Ki-Duk films never offer easy answers, but only interpretations of what is going on and what it all means, thus, requiring the viewer to pay attention to all the details to appreciate the story being told. Not only does the film work incredibly well as a drama, but it also works as a religious film, which is practically unheard of as most religious films are awful. Why does this one succeed while most others fail? It works on a religious level because it's more modest, more down to Earth, and a greater human experience compared to what most other religious films offer. The protege in particular is a very flawed human being who makes rash and life-changing decisions with serious consequences and is forced to deal with the outcomes and learn from his mistakes in his wish for attainment for a greater spiritual connection by learning from his errors and changing the very mold of his soul as time goes by, even if it means living with guilt, suffering in pain, and more. It's a story about human ways, spiritual connections, the beauty of nature and its spiritual connection, and many other things waiting to be discovered and interpreted by the viewer. There are no offensive messages pretending to be religious ideals (I'm looking at you Left Behind series, in particular), no smug and snooze-inducing sermonizing (Once again, Left Behind), no sorry attempts at brainwashing, no flaccid drama, and none of the other pitfalls of religious films. The film not only works on a human level, but it seeks and succeeds at attaining a greater spiritual connection. It's an exhilarating and thought-provoking film that will stay with you longer after it is over because the story and ideas presented are so damn good.\n\nMuch like Kim Ki-Duk's other works, the actors have very little dialogue, but instead force the viewer to look at their facial expressions and their actions to get a sense of what they're feeling and what is going on in a particular scene. While many other actors would never in a million years be able to do this, the actors in this film do a superb job of expressing themselves in subtle ways and turn this film into a powerful drama because of that. There is not a single weak performance to be found and the actors make it impossible to tear your eyes away from the screen.\n\nWith superb storytelling, superb acting, offerings of a spiritual experience, its numerous themes and ideas, its mystery, its beauty, and so much more, Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...And Spring is a film that every film fanatic should watch at least once in their lives because it offers something unlike any film I've ever seen. Simply talking about it isn't enough, it must be experienced to truly understand the magnitude of its greatness.",

This movie emphasized the importance of balancing real life issues, as well as the importance of never straying away from your spirituality. The emphasis of the \"circle of life\" is what made this movie so much more meaningful. I admired how they shed light light on the issue of temptation vs. religion, it was nice to show just how big of an impact lust, etc can cause in someone's life.",

Two people inhabit this idyllic landscape secluded from civilization: a man and a little boy child. The man is a monk and the boy child is his young apprentice. We are guided through a life cycle and the handover of buddhist life heritage between generations. It's an almost meditative experience of great enchantment. In the end this film left me with a faint sensation of nostalgia, seems like I experienced something completely forged by some fundamental Truth, it was highly evocative of my most primordial feelings or memories which are buried in the furthest most inaccessible corners of my consciousness and so I can't dissect what they really are... I'm citing here an excerpt of another critique which, in my opinion, describes the sort of transcendental quality I see in this work or at least why it has this quality: (note I'm only speaking for myself, by \"transcendental\" I don't mean anything relating to spiritual paradigm, I mean the ability this film has to be something greater than the sum of its parts)\n\n\"Spare and contained, with a timeless quality that makes it seem less a product of an individual human imagination than a collective memory...\"\n\nCollective memory... I couldn't say it better, the cinematic and technical craftsmanship could be a bit more polished but this is still notable work from Kim Ki-duk South Korean director, this man created here a powerful film that could very well catalyse the adoption of the spiritual paradigm in the hearts of the irresolute or in dilemma. \"Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring\" has great emotional power and children's tale enchantment yet it's not na\u00efve, it's wise, presenting us a contemplative perspective of its substance grounded on buddhist sapience. I think this is an excellent universal film for both children and adults, regardless of each one's creed. Wonderful movie, highly recommended!",

The primary set is a small, one monk monastery, floating on a small lake in the remote mountains.  The scenery is very attractive.  Many Asian films tend to use an almost poetic treatment of the visuals.  This is especially true of Chinese movies.  The look of a film seems to be as important as the story and the acting.  This can help to make them very pleasant to watch.\n\nThere is very little dialogue.  We follow a boy, apprentice monk, as he matures.  One part of the story was puzzling.  The boy is seen to torture some small animals with apparent glee.  According to Wiki, these scenes were softened for Western audiences.  We note that this a Korean film.  There is a strong thread of violence, blood and guts, and general cruelty in many Korean films.  The Koreans seem to enjoy this sort of thing.  It strikes me as odd.  It makes Korean movies stand out in comparison to Chinese or Japanese films.\n\nThere is a life as a cyclical experience story theme.  Some of the actions of the characters don't seem to make much sense.  The audience is expected to go-with-the-flow.\n\nIt was an OK movie experience.  If you enjoy, impressionistic, poetic takes on film; then you might like this one.",

Jury film makers continued to ignore the wizard (which occurred in December 2003 at the presentation of the European kinoprizov where \"Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter and Spring\" was nominated in the category of non-European bands). Although this work appreciated even ordinary spectators and members of the youth Areopagus - respectively in San Sebastian and Locarno.

It turned out, in general, the chance that the director was in front of the camera, replacing the previously selected actor. On the other hand, this is a special law, and because this film in 2003 was the most confessional and personal to the author, it is significant realized just in the middle of karmic period, which is determined in the amount of 84-years.\n\nJust as the character Kim Ki Doc experiencing youthful yearning flesh, wild male jealousy, mortal sin of homicide and social penalty is a prison, you still have to make a painful climb to the highest hill with a stone and tied with a statue of Buddha in the hands of and the director did a seven-way into the movie, when he came to the simplicity, beauty and peace. Violence and naturalism that are sometimes confused bigots of art in his previous tapes, this time deliberately left overs. And one can only imagine how mercilessly butchered his beloved wife left the floating pagoda fellow monk, as we see when he returned to the monastery on the lake only crazed killer eyes and a bloody knife in his hand, as an instrument of blind revenge. This quiet and majestic places on Earth, even childish pranks (a boy hero tying small rocks to fish, frog or snake) seem unacceptable abuse of nature, for which he had to pay back all my life, \"carrying a stone in my heart,\" said the old monk.\n\nAura nonviolent existence in the film \"Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter and Spring\" is that acutely perceive strange ritual of writing sutras on the platform when the wise old man dips the tail plaintive meows white cat in black ink and patiently deals columns of hieroglyphs, and then makes Renegade-criminal to spiritual repentance cut in his haggard \"murderous knife\" all these characters.
