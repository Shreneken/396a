As much about the fissures in society as it is about crime, not to mention the perceptions we have of ourselves and each other, the depiction of a chaotic and desperate hunt for a serial killer is gripping, laced with comedy and deeply insightful. The artfulness of the film is subtle and almost hypnotic; the brilliant score works with the saturated colour of the bulk of the film to create a strange, unsettling and beautiful effect. Undoubtedly up there with the director's best work, this will worm under your skin and nag at your consciousness long after watching.",

The movie follows a series of murders, which all look like the action of one man, however it is not a 100% clear who did it and why he did it. The movie has some gorgeous cinematography, that reminded me a lot of David Fincher his work, especially Zodiac of course.  While I like a movie as Zodiac a bit more then Memories of Murder, there is no doubting that this movie is fantastic. The performances of everybody are really great, however the atmosphere of the film, is what worked the best for me personally. The movie starts a bit slow for me personally, but when you get in the 2nd and especially 3rd act, the movie shines. The ending of Memories of Murder was fantasticly done, which as well reminded me a lot of Fincher his work, with this case being Se7en. Overall a movie really worth your time, especially if you are a fan of the detective genre!",

            "content": "\"Paper doesn't lie.\"\n\nA tense and engaging investigational thriller that employs plenty of the film design that Bong Joon-Ho has become renowned for - subtext regarding political and social satire interwoven with creative narratives that have enough strength to stand on their own legs. The plot, ostensibly about coming to understand the psyche of an unprecedented killer, really revolves around two key facets, the changing social landscape of South Korea (particularly the political instability that factors into bureacratic ineptitude embodied by Song Kang-ho's Park Doo-man, and the self-defeating strongman tactics employed by his junior, Cho Yong-koo) and a more universal human frailty. While the former investigators rely on their familiarity with local customs and even traditional superstition where their wits fail them, Kim Sang-kyung's Seo Tae-yoon is the more urban, procedural investigator embodying a new way of thinking. Together there is an overlapping goal (catching the killer), but plenty of friction caused by the disparity in their approaches and a surprising amount of humor in the contrast between them in spite of the seriousness of their roles.\n\nUltimately an exercise showcasing the inability of completely rectifying contrasting lifestyles (Park and Seo gradually form a collaborative effort, but are unsuccesful in catching the killer; a 'coming together to save the day' ending would have seemed cheap), Memories of Murder paints an uncertain portrait for the future of a socially divided South Korea filled with people who are imperfect by nature, but also is one particularly taut crime thriller. There's little in the way of audience omnipotence, except a few scattered moments to keep the tension high. The framing, cinematography, and color design all seem way ahead of their time for 2003; this film could easily be released today. The performances are solid, the direction is taut, and the characters/character development are excellent. And what an ending shot, with Song Kang-ho directing his 'eye contact' method to the audience. \n\nDefinitely an influence on Zodiac, but miles better in my opinion. Where Fincher skews towards the true-to-life elements to give the audience a chill and a sense of mystery, Bong Joon-ho clearly has loftier ambitions. (4.5/5)",

This film has painfully flawed characters (who you're rooting for), depressing subject matter, edge-of-your-seat action, and is beautifully shot. The first interrogation scene grabbed my attention; the \"murder reenactment\" scene made me realize that I was watching something special. The character development of Park (Song Kang-ho) and Seo (Kim Sang-kyung) culminates in a penultimate scene that catches your breath in your throat. We catch a glimpse of the killer â€” in a blurry, frightening moment â€” but not enough to identify him. The suspect carousel, the puzzle-piece clues, the fear and distrust fomenting in the provincial town create the tension on which the plot thrives. The story is based on a series of real murders in Korea that have been compared to the \"Zodiac Killer\" in America. In 2003, the murders had not yet been solved, so the ending is powerful and makes sense. However, in only the past few years, that has changed. Memories of Murder is a fantastic movie and has at least three jump-kicks. Hellz yeah.",

            "content": "This is a very good film, one that works on many different levels that can be dissected and analyzed, I wish I was smart enough to see them all. What stood out to me this time was the compositions and beautiful shots, the foggy wheat fields, rain drizzling down muddy streets, lights glowing and bouncing off the wet grass itâ€™s beautifully dark and gritty with an ominous atmosphere. Bong has a lot to say about the very masculine, totalitarian threat looming over us. Democracy isnâ€™t always permanent and a past with this many systemic issues as can be a very real future. I read that he watched Cure repeatedly while writing this and you can see the influence. In that film thereâ€™s much more emphasis on the psyche and digging deep into each of our darkest desires, how easily those can be twisted into gruesome acts of violence given a little pressure. In Memories of Murder, thereâ€™s a different but similar kind of digging. Less of our darkest, suppressed societal desires but the fact those desires exist and are manifested in a setting where murders like this were never expected to happen. How dismantling and confusing the thought of an evil you never imagined existed affects your mind. How the simplest looking of people can do the most grotesque things. The arrogance that this idea was never considered, or taken seriously and had the impact it did, is, in my opinion, what the film is built on. The police don't expect the killer to be a simple man, yet he is (on the outside), and thatâ€™s the scariest thing he couldâ€™ve been. One of my all time favorites, thank you Bongster for this banger. Cannot wait for whatever he does next. ",

The plot was well planned and impactful, but the amount of beating and idiotic policing did become wearing as time went on. Furthermore, the detective from Seoul wasn't as professional nor as intelligent as I expected, although his actions towards the end made sense and allowed for a brilliant scene. It would have been nice to have more background on him considering there was some backstory to the original investigator and then a slight focus on his pal. Aside from that and the perhaps overly comedic tone in places, it seemed to correspond to the actual events well, and the actor for the perpetrator even looked like the real person, despite the case still being unsolved when the film was made. They nailed the perpetrator's behaviour, the ending was excellent, and it will certainly be a film I remember. The pacing was reasonable besides the dragging police corruption, the acting was solid, plenty happened, the action was a mixture of enjoyable, comedic, and tragic, the cinematography and visual effects held up and made Korea look beautiful despite the events, the production design was believable, and the soundtrack was catchy and emotional.",

The suspects are amazing and give material to make the audience think if they're guilty or innocent, especially Park No-Shik (Kwang-Ho) and Park Hae-Il (Hyeon-Gyu).

Bong Joon-ho managed to extract some of the most genuine acting I've seen to where I wouldn't blame you if you thought this was real. Everyone in the film, despite being just a set of characters, felt like a very real person, and in a sense, they might as well be, as the film was based on a real set of investigations. The scenes of abuse are just as shocking as was necessary, and help to drive home Bong Joon-Ho's point about the Republic of Korea's justice system (at least during 1986-1991). The music really suits each of the scenes well, and I could just go on and on. Ultimately, though, I was blown away by this movie, and I can not help but give it a perfect 5 stars out of 5.

It's not the most mind-blowing story, until the ending. If I was born in South Korea and knew about the case or lived through the period, this movie would have had a much bigger impact on me. Doing some research afterward and I realized how profound and powerful that last shot was.\n\nOverall, another great work from Bong Joon-Ho. 8/10",

The themes are serious but it doesn't seem to take itself too serious, lending itself to a more lighthearted feel. I love how Bong nailed the whole 80's fashion and look throughout the movie. Man, Bong really knows how to setup a beautiful shot. This movie's a dark comedy. \n\nWow, so they're trying to convict an innocent retarded kid as the murderer just so they can say that they solved the case, so they can move on? That's so corrupt and crooked. So funny when they bought the kid NICE sneakers instead of NIKE. Jesus, wtf is going on during that time in 1986? There's like military presence on the streets? Is that why these cops are able to do what they do? Drop kicking suspects and acting ruthlessly reckless. How darkly ironic that the detective that tortures suspects with his military boots, now has to have his right leg amputated. The same one who would cover up his right boot with a sleeve to not leave and scratches when he was curb stomping people on the floor. That's karmic justice right there lol. \n\nI like the detective from Seoul's character. He seems like he's out for justice and wants to see things through the right way. I think it was Park who committed the crimes. He was the only one who retaliated out of all the suspects. I mean he had a gun pointed at his face and he took a rock and slashed the inspector's hand! If that were any other innocent suspect, they would have cowered in fear, plead for their life. And just the way he looked like he enjoyed saying that he did the murders is a telling sign. The document at the end saying that there's no DNA proof that it was Park is just Bong's way of saying how incompetent, unhelpful and unreliable America can be when helping other countries. \n\nBong uses subtlety and creepiness in a very effective way by either blurring something in the background or by building tension. Works as a very offbeat and quirky comedy at times, definitely has its own style going on. I will say Bong Joon-Ho definitely has a great sense of humor. I didn't find the color of the movie that pleasing. It has like a greenish grayish tone that makes everything seem more somber, almost artificial in a way. There's some clever social commentary and satire going on here with military and police power. I feel like I need to rewatch this movie again at some point.",

            "content": "Haunting portrayal of the atrocities committed by South Korea's Zodiac Killer.\n\nBong Joon-ho's South Korean crime drama and murder mystery Memories of Murder (2003) is a fascinating, informative, and disturbing depiction of the 1986-1991 serial killings commited in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province. It's startling as it documents the intense and insane homicide detective investigation that was undertaken over years to identify Korea's first documented serial killer. You see enough to disturb your mind and infer what has happened. The film leaves you changed with a sense of the apathetic cruelty that humanity is capable of, yet the decency of good people trying to do their jobs balancing out the evil violence.\n\nI should mention that it's a disgusting case, finally concluded all these years later as the real killer finally confessed in 2019, which Bong obviously didn't know about as the film released in 2003, but it adds a layer of satisfaction knowing that he has been caught. I think Memories of Murder is one of the greatest pictures I've ever seen, one of South Korea's best films, and a peerless crime drama. Only The Silence of the Lambs, Se7en, Cure, or Zodiac can truly compare in craftsmanship and chills. Memories of Murder is in a class all its own for its raw realism and sleek direction.\n\nBong Joon-ho's direction is riveting as he details the entire police investigation in shocking true crime with heavy rainfall, long takes, and creepy atmosphere everywhere. Director Bong uses the cover of nightfall, shadows, dark paths, and eerie forestry to unnerve the viewer as the grisly details are unveiled. It's shocking to see any crime of this grotesque and cruel nature, let along hearing someone speak the facts right to you. Bong builds the detective's case with facts, suspects, time, evidence, motive, and connects the dots between the killings so that we can easily draw the same conclusions as Korea's law enforcement at the time.\n\nFurthermore, Bong contributes his own added absurdist sense of humor as there's plenty to laugh at to lighten the mood of this seriously horrifying case. I was surprised at how funny Memories of Murder starts out as these detectives tried anything and everything from torture to shamans to figure out who the killer was, but it evolves into an astonishing display of enthralling deduction and reasoning alongside brutal killings. \n\nSong Kang-ho is hilarious as the immoral and insane cop with a ruthless attitude Detective Park Doo-man. You see the Korean government's brutal and outdated tactics with his character, especially with his countryside cop methods. Song Kang-ho is perfect here as he also displays his dramatic prowess towards the end as he gets more seriously involved in the case. Likewise, Kim Sang-kyung is excellent as Seoul Detective Seo Tae-yoon with his big city methodology and cool seriousness. You understand that Detectives Park and Seo needed to work together with their combined unorthodox and by the book, respectively, techniques. They are incredible leading actors in Memories of Murder, especially once the camera is right up on their eyes.\n\nKim Roe-ha's erratic and violence police officer is both fun and shocking as he tortures suspects in interrogation for false confessions and worthless testimony as Detective Cho Yong-koo. Song Jae-ho is funny and bears a strong presence as Sergeant Shin Dong-chul with his gravitas and experience. I liked Park No-shik's funny performance as the mentally challenged witness Baek Kwang-ho. I must mention the cold and captivating performance from Park Hae-il as serial killer suspect Park Hyeon-gyu. I should say that Go Seo-hee is beautiful and compelling as Officer Kwon Kwi-ok. Jeon Mi-seon is lovely and captivating as the endearing Kwok Seol-yung, similarly.\n\nWriters Bong Joon-ho, Kim Kwang-rim, and Shim Sung-bo find the humanity of these detectives getting pushed into the dark oblivion of hopelessness from optimistic beginnings. It's terrifying to watch them unravel. Bong Joon-ho amazed me with his delightful satire Parasite, but Memories of Murder remains his finest masterclass of refined direction and his greatest picture.\n\nKim Sun-min's editing keeps you absorbed by the mystery with quickly developing clues and sharp cuts from detectives to the murder's perspective for an all encompassing 131 minutes of mayhem. Kim Hyung-koo's cinematography is breathtaking with ultra wide shots of the paddy fields hiding a killer to the serial killer lurking up in the shadows of a treetop. Everything is on screen for you to see and enjoy. Ryu Seong-hie's production design impressively recreates 1986 Korea, while Yang Hong-sam's set decoration looks all gritty and grungy for the furnishings.\n\nTaro Iwashiro's score is beautiful with an ever increasing sense of dread to his composition. Kim Yoo-seon's costumes have a natural look with a cute fashion sense that comes across as fun for such a dreary picture. Jong Ik Kang comes up with all manner of striking visual effects for gunshots and needle injections.\n\nIn conclusion, there's depraved humanity and then there's humanity's aptitude for creating beautiful art like Bong Joon-ho's Memories of Murder.",

The film, based on a true crime story that was not solved at the time of the film's original release, is about the efforts of some local detectives to find a serial killer. Two detectives from a local police department, one of who has anger control issues, and the other who seems to have gotten his training from crime detective television shows, are joined by an educated detective from Seoul. The first half of the film is very funny watching Detective Park conjure all of his worst and amateur sleuthing skills, even visiting a psychic, to make headway in the crime. As typical with Joon-Ho's films, his stories linger along the cultural boundaries, and in this case, he finds humor in the contrast in investigating styles between the three detectives. There are shifts in mood that are also characteristic of his films. You find yourself laughing and then suddenly realize something horribly serious is happening. And, like Parasite, the noticeable divisions between the characters blur as the story continues and the murder investigation leads nowhere. This is a well-crafted crime story that is beautifully shot and wonderfully acted. While I don't know a lot about Korean history, it was interesting to watch these events unfold in a culture that seemed to not have any experience with serial killers and where the police didn't have time to dedicate resources to fighting the crime because they were out covering demonstrations and focusing on \"other priorities\". I loved this film, which gets a huge thumbs up from me. It is excellent entertainment and is one of my favorite films of his.",

With \"Memories of Murder\", we receive his classic 2003 serial murder mystery, which in spite of being only his second feature, is a strong rival for his best work. Though compared favourably to David Fincher's excellent \"Zodiac\", this cracker Korean film came four years prior.\n\nBased on real life events that gripped South Korea back in the late eighties, this riveting thriller delivers Bong's clever filmmaking touches, mixing pull no punches drama with deft comedic bits to create a rich viewing experience. Whether the small village cops slapsticking and bungling a gruesome crime scene, or brutally extorting confessions from the innocent, they do so in a flowing, organic rhythm of tone shifts that is key to the movie going experience.\n\nParasite star Song Kang-ho is excellent as the rowdy, cocksure detective who claims to reveal criminals by looking deep into their eyes. He is the perfect blend of boisterous, naive, silly, gung ho and empathetic. As with most Bong projects, such sublime character development is crucial to the plot.\n\nThe less said about the storyline the better (and the real story has some interesting recent revelations). Best left to discover that on your own. \"Memories of Murder\" defies the \"early effort\" tagline. It is a fully developed, beautifully shot, perfectly paced, and gripping film, from start to finish. A shadowy thinker, it ranks right up there with \"Parasite\", tackling political, personal and societal themes in the guise of a simple story, in what is now a considerable Bong cannon, and is a much welcome discovery.\n\n- hipCRANK",

Had I seen this back in 2003 when it was first released, I would've concluded that this film, based on the true story of a serial rapist-murderer in a rural Korean town in 1986, ticks so many boxes we associate with Nordic noirs, we could've called it Kimchi noir. Rice paddy fields replace snow-covered landscapes as the menacing backdrop where a mismatched cop duo, one temperamental and prone to bend rules to get results and the other more subdued and contemplative, investigate a series of gruesomely portrayed murders which always take place on sad rainy days. It is a beautifully shot crime drama that's ultimately less about the crime and more about the obsessive detectives and how the case affects them. While I'm not sure if one can track any early signs of greatness here that point to Bong's eventual breakthrough as a future Oscar winner, there is no doubt a strong sense of composition and visual flair at work here, especially in his framing and use of close-ups; while a dark sense of humour permeates his writing, including a wicked sense of justice which in this film manifests in one of the detective's recurring use of a flying kick against (normally innocent) suspects and the fate of his leg in the final act. Though I was initially irritated by the film's more slapstick comedic tone towards Song Kang-ho's Detective Park's incompetence and dubious judgements, that surprisingly ends up making his character almost understandable, if not redemptive even by the final act. Hindsight is a wonderful thing but there's no denying that this is a solid and promising effort from a young director whose elegant storytelling abilities will take him far.",

He tends to blend dramatic heft with comedy and suspense and it almost always works either very well or greatly.  A lot of his films have satire too, which I'm always a sucker for.  It's no different with this film.  At it's core it's a detective thriller about an anonymous serial killer and rapist who prays on young women.  Pretty basic stuff.  However, the trick of this movie is that the majority of it is spent trying to identify who the killer is, and by the end, our main characters never find out.  Much like David Fincher's 'Zodiac', by the end of the film, the protagonist is staring at someone.  However, here he's staring not at one individual, but at us, the audience.  Prior to this final shot, the protagonist is told by a little girl that, presumably the killer, is someone rather plain and ordinary looking.  Does this imply that monsters like this walk among us and we don't even know it?  Is that what the movie is trying to convey in this final shot?  I believe so.",

The subject matter is serious and dark, so I thought this could be a gritty detective drama. I always enjoy a murder mystery and a police procedural, so that aspect of the film had me excited. However, at the same time that there was all this heavy stuff happening, there were a few characters bumbling around almost as incompetent as the Keystone Cops. The way these small-town cops treat a serial killer case is so ridiculous it bordered on farce, and I couldnâ€™t tell if I was supposed to be laughing. Itâ€™s a tough balancing act to pull off a movie that is both dramatic and comical, and Iâ€™m not sure they did the best job finding the balance. However, there were times when it worked and the contrast did a great job of making the comedy even more humorous. The case that is the focus of this story is one that creates some great scenes loaded with tension. I love how they slowly piece together the M.O. of the killer and that creates a framework for us to recognize imminent danger. This makes later scenes even more frightening because we know what is coming. I enjoyed seeing the unique aspects of an investigation in Korea, and some of the struggles that they experience. Itâ€™s easy to get accustomed to the style of American police work (or at least the kind we see portrayed on TV and in the movies,) but these characters have challenges that we donâ€™t anticipate when they have to look into a case like this one. The other thing that made this film more powerful was the visual style. Bong Joon-ho captures some amazing visuals that will stick in my mind for a long time, and uses them in order to add to dark aesthetic of the story. What makes Memories of Murder more than just a simple procedural is the relationship dynamics between the lead characters. Song Kang-ho plays the small town detective who has his way of doing things that is misguided, but apparently has worked for him in the past. Kim Sang-kyung plays the newcomer from the big city who wants a more structured investigation by the book. You can see from the start that these two are going to butt heads over how to solve the case, and it becomes one of the main points of conflict in the film. I only wish we were allowed to see more merit in the method from Song Kang-hoâ€™s character, because he is so obviously in the wrong the whole time he becomes more of an annoyance instead of a quirky positive presence. I still got deeply involved in the mystery and was riveted most of the way through Memories of Murder. While it wasnâ€™t a perfectly executed thriller or a perfectly executed comedy, it had enough good qualities from both genres to keep me engaged.",

I'm not even sure where to begin: so I'll start by saying that I'm having trouble finding anything I didn't like. Director Bong Joon-ho has proved himself a master filmmaker with this movie - from the way he stages a scene, to the way he moves the camera, to the sheer attention to detail displayed in every moment. He also manages to get some terrific performances out of his cast, and it was genius to see how the two main detectives, played perfectly by Song Kang-Ho and Kim Sang-kyung, were so different throughout the whole movie - yet with a crime like this, appeared exactly the same at the end. There's not much else I can say, but I implore you to seek this Korean masterpiece out. I was hooked from the very beginning, and the end was masterful in the way it was one of the most disturbing parts of the film, that at the same time didn't involve anything grotesque.

Their efforts are impeded by some sloppy crime scene procedure by the police.  Their methods of solving cases are also quite basic, essentially amounting to beating confessions out of suspects.  All this leads to nothing and the police chief brings in a more sophisticated and intelligent detective from Seoul, Seo Tae-yoon.  With his arrival the methods improve but they still don't have the killer.  Then another woman is found murdered and a pattern emerges...\n\nGripping drama from writer-director Joon-ho Bong.  Intriguing from the start, and the intrigue ramps the more you get into it.  Gritty, realistic and certainly doesn't glamorize detective work - so many red herrings and dead ends!\n\nQuite funny at times too.  The methods of the local detectives are sometimes very farcical and the director makes the most of these moments of comedy.\n\nVery powerful and thought-provoking ending.  As with the remainder of the plot, not at all predictable or formulaic.\n\nSolid performances, especially from the two leads, Kang-ho Song and Sang-kyung Kim.",

            "content": "Okay, I'll preface this by saying that South Korea is a master of cinema; the whole Korean cinematic industry has made a fantastic job in showing the world what filmmaking is all about.\n\nThis movie is a prime example of that.\n\nSarinui chueok, or Memories of Murder for the rest of the world, is not just a police-procedural movie, okay? It's not your typical murder-mystery thriller. This movie is all about characters, human characters, all-too human. This movie will show you, in a superb manner, the complexity of the human being.\n\nThat's what makes this movie so complex: it deals with the nature of human beings against something they do not understand, it takes characters to places where they'll lose their minds; it will strip its characters from their pragmatic ego's, from their self-centered personas. It will show humans at the turn of their most obscure side. It will show you what happens when humans step into the Dark Side of the Moon.\n\nHow? Well, the answer is simple. Take a South Korean lazy-corrupt officer (detective Park) along his even more lazy-corrupt-and-aggressive partner (detective Cho) to investigate the most hideous serial killer of that time (1980s) in a very small town. Let them show you their sleazy ways. Let them show you their incompetence when it comes to work, serious work that is: you're investigating a series of murders! \n\nThese men will torture suspects just for the simple reason that \"they heard he committed the murders\", that's how bad they can be. \n\nLet's take it even further, just to show how far their corruptness can go: they will plant evidence just so they can convict a suspect of a crime, even if that suspect is mentally disabled.\n\nThese two guys are just a complete mess when it comes to working. However they think their crooked ways are the right ones. Detective Park usually says: \"I can simply look at a man's eyes and find out if he's guilty or no\", that's he's way of thinking, you get the idea now?\n\nSo we have two incompetent-corrupt officers of the law. Now bring an outsider (detective Seo), an officer straight from the capital and a serious man about his work - because they investigate murders, it has to be very serious work. This man will show them his pragmatic ways of working: \"documents never lie\" he would normally say when referring to the evidence. This man does not torture suspects; he will only follow the evidence. This man knows his stuff.\n\nWhat happens when these opposing forces meet? A complete mess is what happens, to say the least. Detective Seo will slowly show these two lazy-asses how to run an investigation, and despite his efforts to show how scientific procedures can help you bring down a serial killer, these two dirt-bags will try to show this pragmatic detective how their ways are the right ones, how esoteric methods can beat science, how rumors are more valid then congruent pieces of evidence, how, just for the fact that South Korea is a small country, the methods used by other countries, such as the U.S., won't work in that country: \"Korea is of the size of my penis, that's why we investigate with our feet, because you can walk the whole country in day\" detective Park said to detective Seo. \n\nSo we have two characters that take major roles: detective Park and detective Seo, and they make a great contrast for the plot.\n\nNow we have to talk about the one person who will bring this to a nice triangle: the murderer; who is he? It doesn't matter, he is just a McGuffin used to let characters develop their worst sides or their better sides - again this movie is just about characters, about the way humans behave under extreme circumstances. Still we get to spend a lot of time with all the suspects and their different personalities.\n\nSo all you have to concentrate on is what the main characters do or say throughout the movie since everything will be vital for the plot.\n\nYou get to enjoy the moments where you see detective Park spend time with his wife: we get moments intimacy, moments where they talk and he shows some jealousy because his wife - a nurse - gets requested the most by patients at the hospital, and we get to see where most of detective Park's not-so-clever-ideas come from, ideas such as \"going with a psychic\" to find out who the murderer is.\n\nThe characters in the story are just as real and perfect as they can get, and the serial killer story hits the jackpot of story-telling. So what about the directing of the movie? Admirable is the adjective I'll use to answer. You can't really expect much from director Bong's sophomore attempt at filmmaking with a near-broke studio, right? Wrong. Director Bong made wonderful use of camera work; take one of the first scenes of the movie: we get a nice long shot that shows us what mess of a crime scene the detectives had due to their incompetence and terrible communication. \n\nWe get some beautiful takes of the landscapes with great natural lighting, and thanks to the opportunistic weather at the time of filming, we get some wonderful takes that really captured the depressed feeling that director Bong wanted to project to the audience.\n\nThe movie itself has a great sense of humor at the beginning, since the movie itself satirizes the South Korean system, all the way from the press, police force, political views, and the way we sometimes tend to think. But near the end of the movie we start to feel a brilliant change of humor, from a witty sense of humor, to a very serious thriller, we start to see the characters get more serious in the plot; we start to feel the tension of the plot as it reaches its brilliant ending.\n\nThis way of making the seriousness of the plot change makes the movie all the more better: you get moments of laughs and you get moments of tension.\n\nThis change, however, does not only happen in the plot, it also happens to the characters - the two main characters - take detective Park for instance: corrupt, incompetent, lazy, and stupid at times, turns out by the end, in a beautifully executed scene (train track scene), we get to see him coming clean and admitting that he does not know who can be guilty of a crime by just simply looking at their eyes. \n\nDetective Seo, the pragmatic, flat-footed detective, on the other hand, starts to succumb to the nasty ways of detective Park: he starts to lose his nerve and even slaps the poor mentally disabled suspect, who happens to know the identity of the killer, in an attempt to get the kids testimony for evidence. It doesn't end well for the mentally disabled kid... We also see detective Seo beat the living hell out of the main suspect just because he is so sure he's the killer, but then the evidence (the documents) shows him that he is not the killer; all this will just push detective Seo to the edge of madness. Now all this is shown in that one masterful/powerful scene along with detective Park's moment of clarity: one sees the light, the other sees the darkness; talk about good writing and good directing.\n\nThe movie's ending is just sublime, it will leave you make you think more about the whole movie... gives me the chills just by thinking of that last close shot at detective Park's look, you can really feel him all the way to the end of that scene.\n\nThe audacity for directing, writing, and cinematography in this movie is just fabulous, one couldn't ask for more. \n\nThis movie was hailed by Tarantino in one of his interviews as one of the most interesting and complex movie he had ever seen, and damn right it is!\nThis movie was made for all type of audiences, it's fun, interesting, intriguing, and cathartic. You will be missing out on one of the best movies of modern times.\n\nFun fact: one of the studios that produced the movie: Sidus, was near bankruptcy when the movie was filmed, and due to the movie's unexpected success the studio went back on track and is now a major studio in South Korea.",

It was fortunate that it only took two films to find that sense of satisfaction; it was by the mind and hands of Joon-ho Bong, his sophomore feature film Memories of Murder.\n\nMemories of Murder features a strong and appealing premise of a rape-murder mystery set in a local town; two detectives with their own distinctive styles have been chosen to solve the case. It is in the difference of each detective's style that the film manages to be interesting; with comedic touches set by the director in order to let the first hour or so of the film to not be too suffocating with its serious and dire subject. It was through this that the characters were unique, allowing both to stand out from one another and create a sense of clash of ethics and methods, but the film does not resort to the clichÃ©d elevation of internal tension, letting both characters be focused and determined to identify and catch the person responsible for these sickening crimes.\n\nThe mystery of the plot itself starts off being a bit slow in exposition, it takes a while for the audience to find something to chew on; it is only when facts start to emerge and solidify their importance to the story, that the film starts to pick up its pace, and create tension; evoking a sense of urgency that is felt both on screen and in ourselves. It is during the final hour of the film that I found myself highly engaged by its mystery and suspense, with comedic elements finally carrying a sense of weight for the characters; showing a sense of desperation, meaning that the case has finally crawled within the inner depths of their souls, becoming an obsession rather than an obligation. It is during this part of the film that the dialogue driven exposition begins to slow itself down, halted by tense chase sequences and big reveals that leaves audiences in a state of exhilaration.\n\nIt all builds, brick by brick, to a conclusion that satisfies in a way that one wouldn't expect. It becomes internal rather than external; emphasising the detectives themselves rather than bigger story; it is character development that has slowly been building under our noses, paying off at the end that makes one want to go back and see their entire journey again. The film ends with a final frame that speaks volumes of its ideas and themes; I feel it would be unfair to those who have yet seen the film to divulge these thematic elements, as its exposure may hurt the impact the film would have to surprise and intellectually stimulate. Also it would be better for me to discuss it when I have seen the film multiple times, understanding all the elements that make up the film.\n\nMemories of Murder is a damn near perfect mystery thriller that keeps audiences on their toes and delivering a conclusion that beautifully exceeds one's expectations. This is a film that does not aim to satisfy the immediate desires of its audience, it targets the nerves in our body that find excitement in deep and resonating intellectual and emotional stimulation.",

The way he is able to play around with cop archetypes in interesting ways, get resonantly strong performances out of his cast, and inflect bits of weird humor and social commentary into the proceedings makes it all feel different and not like the type of cop story we've seen a thousand times before.

The locals are not impressed; and make life difficult for him.\n\nThe two local detectives try to beat confessions out of the most handy suspects.  They are not interested in investigating the crimes.  One is older and a little brighter.  The younger one is a blunt object; and short in the thinking department.  Many of their scenes have a comedic element because they are so bumbling and ineffective.  The outsider detective, Seo, begins to track the real killer.\n\nWe never see the killer clearly as he hunts his victims.  We never see the crimes going down.  The crime scenes are surprisingly bland.  Korean action/mystery movies tend to be very graphic and bloody; not so here.\n\nAs more and more victims are murdered, Seo begins to crack.  He eventually loses his professional composure.  The scene is very well done.\n\nThe ending is ambiguous and somewhat unsatisfying.\n\nIt was an OK trip to the flics.",

They decide to incorporate someone from the local city to help solve it since his approach is radically different than the homicide detective assigned to.

It's a South Korean film based on the first actual recordings of serial murders in the country. There are great films that ask questions rather than giving answers and it works; \"Memories of Murder,\" to me is a film that would have worked better if it gave answers instead of asking questions, it deprived me of a satisfying experience. I don't think I am spoiling much because the film's opening subtitles already tell you it's based on \"an unresolved criminal investigation.\" It has three major flaws in its story: it takes too long for the detectives to revisit the mentally challenged boy regarding a murder, to me it was obvious. Also since it is believed that the serial killer murders women who are wearing red on rainy nights, why were the last two victims not wearing red? The first, older woman leaves her red jacket at home and for the latter of the two it did not rain. I am guessing the detectives' information was false regarding this killer, but I still consider it a flaw because these amending observations are never mentioned by the detectives or anyone else. The last issue I have is of one of the detective's wife crossing paths with a girl that is going to be murdered; why didn't the wife mention this to her husband? Throughout the film we see the husband and wife talk to each other about various things regarding his work, about suspects and what not; why don't they mention this to each other? I also found the investigations to be tiresome where the detectives beat up the suspects and it's also somewhat predictable.\n\nThe director is able to build suspense and its actors provide good performances, especially Song Kang-ho as detective Park. It also can be quite funny at times. Even with its flaws and it eventually faltering, it still is an enjoyable crime-drama, especially the chase scene. I see where the director was going with this but to me the point was not clearly informed.\n\nP.S. How stupid are these women to be alone so late at night? Couldn't they find any other means to reach their destination? I found it baffling, one or two in particular obviously were aware that there are killings taking place.",

Despite the sombre tone, much of this stuff is played for laughs, at least until the detectives' very human shortcomings become more a tragedy than the actual killings.\r\n\r\n--7.0/10--",

Young women repeatedly going off alone in the KNOWN area where the murders were taking place. \nThere's just SO much wrong with this story!

I recommend this movie to be watched in high definition so the viewer can appreciate the scenery as it mesmerizes you with the audio and top notch cinematography that is at hand here.

The direction is rich in style and content and guides the story and characters through this journey with feeling and purpose, while the story is wonderfully written and presented, with only a couple of scenes here and there that are a tad overlong. Not much else to say really, and I definitely recommend this type of film, as opposed to the paint-by-numbers thrillers that Hollywood sometimes churns out when they are afraid that the audience might get confused, or god forbid talk about the film's meaning afterwards.",

            "content": "South-Korean Cinema is one of those areas which I have yet to completely explore. Thanks to the Brutal thrilling Korean classic Oldboy, came out in 2003, I got highly excited about exploring the Korean world continuing my journey with this incredible film: Memories of Murder. \n\nMemories of Murder, based on a true story, is a crime thriller set in the late 1980's. Two rural cops and a special detective from Seoul try hard to search for the killer who ruthlessly rapes women, especially on rainy nights a factor that probably excites him. The film shows us the usual cat-and-mouse chase. Though it's not an experience that cliched thrillers gives, just running around here and there...\n\nWhat mostly bothers me are the subtitles in any foreign movie. The way you have to look down every time while missing all the action even on a small scale might distract you. Memories of Murder is one of those foreign films where the above factor just doesn't completely apply. Some of the best scenes of this film happen in silence. There are truly great examples of camera work in this film that includes the dry but powerful cinematography, few but effective Steadicam shots and of course the direction. Like in one scene when the lead Detective comes to inspect the first crime scene (also filmed in one continuous shot), they find a shoe print nearby on a small road as an evidence. Suddenly, a tractor comes out of nowhere and ignoring the Detective's cries (\"No Stop!\") it goes over the evidence smudging the entire print. This is one particular scenario which was shot with such realism that you connect yourself with the movie and become a part of it. I don't care how simple or complex the scenes are, the most vital property of any good cinema is that it should allow you to become a part of that experience. Even sounds are important in this film. Can't explain that in detail but you will notice it once you have seen it. The acting too is superb, as always in any great film.\n\nMemories of Murder though doesn't concentrate much on the murders, it kind of gives more attention to the emotional aspects of the characters involved the case. Hence, the name. When you say Memories of Murder it refers not only to the ones solving the case but also the ones who were the victim of this brutality. The film truly goes more beyond the thriller part and at the conclusion of the film, no one will deny that they had watched something different. The downside is that it takes little patience to watch the film and the film's ending is not that easy to take in. Still, I am highly impressed by the different style of film-making of South-Koreans. \n\nIn conclusion, Memories of Murder is a realistic document of the incident, not like some Hollywood flicks that put in some spice like an exit line just after killing someone or the hero looking walking away from an explosion. If you are a good lover of cinema, this will hardly disappoint you. There is one thing I have learned so far in South-Korean thrillers: Always expect the unexpected. Just in case of this film, it comes out in a very subtle manner...\n\nVisit my facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/filmsthemostbeautifulart",

Congrats on the lack of blood and for not actually showing the girls being murdered - Quite right, this is about a criminal investigation not the latest slasher/horror. The way one policeman kicked around his suspect didn't surprise or bother me in the least - we all know that sort of thing goes on. Apart from that the film wasn't really violent. I didn't mind the ending (i won't give it away) and most of it was interesting without being anything special. The photography, especially at the beginning, gave the movie something different from the usual cop stuff - but i i didn't notice the music apart from a dramatic chase scene. All in all it's above average....although i might have been a little generous giving it a good three stars.",

            "content": "I may very well be the only person in the entire world who is not in love with this film, please bear this in mind if you read on.\n\nThe story of inane, underfunded detectives in a rural town in South Korea and their investigation of serial sexual assaults and murders committed by someone whom has proved faultless and far too elusive for small-town detectives to catch. This is the backdrop for what the movie really is, which is a lecture on the horrors of certainty, and the cruelness of doubt.\n\nI won't go into it, in an effort to avoid filling my review with the usual myriad spoilers. Instead, I'd like to focus on the superficial layer- the story and the way in which we are narrated to. Often in an attempt to build character, the story will plough off in tangential directions- this technique normally works for me, but here left me a little drowsy. The characters weren't real for me, never once did the film seem to be too fussed whether or not you particularly care about the central cast, so why bother wasting time with these distractions? What I'm saying is that the film is far from taut, quite in fact, overly long would not be an understatement.\n\nThe acting here is great, and the characters are filled with personality by their very capable actors- speaking of which, you really do need to love Korean actors and their willingness to literally throw themselves into their parts- all of whom do a great job. Unfortunately, however, they're put in the difficult position of performing a tricky balancing act. Joon-ho Bong is asking them to juggle the severely macabre with quirky, almost slapstick humour. Not an easy feat by far, and not amusing for myself in the slightest. Perhaps the idea was to add some relief for the viewer from the lazy plot? \n\nThe biggest crime committed here is to waste such a talented cast and beautiful cinematography and direction on such a dull story. Conventional is perhaps not enough in describing how prosaic the story is. A certain adjective must be applied, but which is suitably strong I'm not certain. Rigidly conventional, perhaps? One couldn't help but compare the film to the likes of Seven, etc. And yes, in the long run, Memories of Murder does indeed have more value, but I know which I'd rather watch again. Strangely, when I found myself comparing Memories of Murder to other films of the genre, I found that my head wouldn't drift to other films, but in fact to television. And how much better certain TV shows were in almost every respect to this film. \n\nQuite in fact, this whole genre has been out-sleuthed by it's televised counterpart. The once bastard child of the visual arts, in it's renaissance, out-classes and out-characterises film to such a level as to almost make this type of tale a vainglorious waste when displayed on the cinema screen. Almost. See, what cinema still has, and will always have over television, is brevity. The ability to make an existential observation, or frame a timeless and endlessly endearing story is somewhat difficult when drafted well over 50-odd hours of footage and script. Well-crafted film is also beautiful- and that is a particular strength of this film. Joon-ho Bong clearly has a special sense when it comes to knowing just how to frame the beautiful Korean countryside; it's pretty glorious here with all it's rustic charm.\n\nThe story though, with all it's twists and it's turns, in the end follows the sign-posts of the genre. There are ups, there are downs, there's a murder, there's a clue, there's a twist, and so on. The Wire captures the intricacies of the reality behind the drug war, The Killing with it's often gruellingly slow pace manages to manifest all of the characters in the show with layers of depth, elevating itself far above the stock crime procedural. What does Memories of Murder do? This is the question I asked myself when determining how I would score it. I found very little to distinguish it from other movies of a similar ilk- up until the end, of course. But, sadly, that just wasn't enough.\n\nThe strengths of 'Memories of Murder' are very much the talented crew, beautiful shots of the Korean countryside, and the lingering sadness it evokes long after the credits roll.\n\nFrankly? I preferred The Chaser.",
