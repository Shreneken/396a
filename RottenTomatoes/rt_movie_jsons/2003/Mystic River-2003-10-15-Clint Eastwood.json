    "summary": "When the daughter (Emmy Rossum) of ex-con Jimmy Marcus (Sean Penn) is murdered, two of his childhood friends from the neighborhood are involved. Dave (Tim Robbins), a blue-collar worker, was the last person to see her alive, while Sean (Kevin Bacon), a homicide detective, is heading up the case. As Sean proceeds with his investigation, Jimmy conducts one of his own through neighborhood contacts. Eventually, Jimmy suspects Dave is the culprit and considers taking the law into his own hands.",

            "content": "This movie is great. Sean Penn gives a powerful performance that will have you fighting back the tears and the rest of the cast is strong too. The plot is deep and emotional and there is a really good twist that you may work out with the characters, or if you really pay attention you could work out earlier on. My only complaint is the ending dragged on and the last 10ish minutes felt unnecessary. Definitely a must see film if you haven't already.",

This movie is just pure emotion, how a human has so much hate in itself, how revenge takes over a humans body and that love will be stronger then anything else. Clint Eastwood gives a raw movie, no crazy over the top cinematography, but an incredible screenplay and a movie filled with brilliant performances. This will be one to remember.",

            "content": "Warning: Spoilers\nAfter three eleven year-olds from a close-knit lower middle class Boston suburb undergo a tragic experience where one is abducted and abused for four days, their lives diverge. The abducted one never overcomes the emotional trauma, another begins a life of crime, and the third becomes a cop. None ever venture very far from the neighborhood. When tragedy strikes again, their lives are gradually brought back together on a collision course that leads to some unexpected results.\n\nMystic River is a surprisingly dark film, with a controversial denouement. It is masterfully directed, acted, shot, edited, lit and scored. It is a mostly humorless and occasionally difficult realist drama, that will undoubtedly affect most viewers emotionally in a variety of ways--you may cry, you may become angry with at least one character and the lack of just deserts, and you may find it a bit depressing, although producer/director/composer Clint Eastwood and scripter Brian Helgeland do through in a relatively minor glimmer of hope/happiness at the very end.\n\nNot that I tend to agree with awards organizations, but it should be no surprise that Mystic River has fine acting. A bulk of its many awards and nominations, including two Oscar victories, were for on screen performances. What is less recognized is the positive effect that the locations, cinematography, lighting and score have on the atmosphere of the film. Kokayi Ampah found the perfect, generic, metropolitan lower middle class neighborhoods, buildings and bars. It could be any slightly depressing, but maybe about to gentrify, suburb of Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, Detroit, or any number of at least Northeastern and Midwestern U.S. cities. Tom Stern's cinematography is continually, subtly inventive. Just check out the shot of Sean Penn where shadows from a railing form symbolic jail bars on the wall behind him. The lighting tends to the late 1990s/early 2000s look that is more monochromatic and leaning-towards blue. There are a lot of well-placed shadows, often creating a chiaroscuro look. Eastwood's score is understated but very effective. And how can you not like a film where three sexy girls dance on top of a bar to jazz fusion?\n\nThe story is absorbing. There is an unexpected (to me, at least--I try to watch films the first time knowing as little about them as possible) mystery angle that is effectively sustained until almost the end. I haven't read Dennis Lehane's novel yet, but I just ordered it after seeing the film--the film piqued my interest enough to want to explore more. But the most interesting part of the story to me, at least, was the extremely gray depiction of Penn's character, Jimmy Markum. Markum is revealed to be largely criminal, and not quite likable in his attitude towards his daughter (he doesn't respect her individuality, even though she's actually an adult). Yet at the same time, he is compared by at least one character to a \"king\", and in many ways, he is treated as one in the neighborhood. This may or may not be meant more metaphorically by the character saying it, but it is possible to read much of the film as being about a traditional king trying to live in modern day metropolitan suburbia. In some historical and cultural contexts, surely Markum's behavior in the film would have a more noble sheen, including his \"mistake\". This is perhaps why poetic justice never arrives, and instead, the character is seen as contented, with his queen and court by his side, being regaled with a parade instead. In modern contexts, many kings' behavior would not be so noble, and instead we'd notice more the injustices done to the peasantry and sympathize with them. Markum's character cannot be depicted more literally as royalty, as if he were far removed from the socio-economic status of the film's peasantry (although we find out eventually that he has more money to spare than most folks in his neighborhood), because it would be instead read as a moral tale of economic disparity as is exists solely in modern times. Putting everyone on a level playing field, more or less, is the only way to create a parable of how kings would be perceived, solely in terms of their decisions and actions, in our era.\n\nOf course, there is more to the film than that, and it's not the only interpretation possible (in fact, it probably seems very left field to many readers), but it's worth pointing out not only as something literally interesting to contemplate, but to show the kind of storytelling depth that is contained in Mystic River--a film you should not miss.",

Bacon and Fishburne make for a terrific buddy cop duo, miles better than director Clint Eastwood's attempt with Charlie Sheen in the former's 1990 release 'The Rookie'.\n\nThe conclusion does I guess go in line with what precedes it, particularly with Robbins' character, but I'm not fully convinced by who is eventually unveiled as you know what.

It's easy to pick out Tim Robbins in one of his few high-profile performances post-Shawshank, but look closely and you'll also see Sandlot protagonist Tom Guiry hanging around in a supporting role. \n\nThough Flags of Our Fathers, Unforgiven, and a few other Eastwood titles have touched on pretty dark dramatic territory, Mystic River pushes the boundaries for the director into neo-noir thriller territory. The cinematography is surprisingly crisp for a 2003 film, it's a style that would come to be adopted by a subsequent generation of 'gritty' thrillers and dramas alike. Narratively, it's a capable but probably not world-changing mystery; there are appropriately subverted expectations, good procedural investigation elements, and the involvement of the audience in the course of the plot without being omnipotent observers. I'm not necessarily the most convinced by the film's ending (or more specifically, the responses of the main characters to certain revelations about their own actions, without going into too many spoilers), but it's still pretty enjoyable (and most importantly, believable despite being grim). Though taking a peak at the cast list might initially make you think that the film was attempting to trade on name recongition rather than competent filmmaking, it's hard to complain about any of the performances; even the relatively little-known Guiry (who hasn't really escaped child actor status) does justice to an unexpectedly complex character. \n\nWhy is Fishburne's character unironically named Whitey Powers? Beats me. (3.5/5)",

            "content": "Clint Eastwood's \"Mystic River\" is an intimate, gripping and riveting crime drama that offers a fresh interpretation of Dennis Lehane's best-selling book. With his twenty-seventh feature, legendary director Clint Eastwood crafted an astonishing adaptation of Dennis Lehane's book that holds up today as a crime classic. Using spellbinding cinematography, Eastwood draws viewers into the lives of three friends whose lives are impacted by a family tragedy. From intimate close-ups to gorgeous establishing shots, the cinematography keeps viewers immersed in the film's setting. Eastwood showcases immense control over the story, performers and setting, proving to be an expert at building a tense mood and atmosphere. Brian Helgeland's screenplay is also sensational, and expertly uses clever non-linear storytelling to keep viewers absorbed in the murder mystery. It is hard to not praise the powerful performances from the cast. Sean Penn delivers one of the best performances of his career as Jimmy Markum. With riveting expressions, he conveys the guilt, desperation and righteous anger of a tormented father that is determined to avenge his daughter's death. Tim Robbins is equally excellent in the role of a sexually abused victim that becomes an easy scapegoat for the murder. Robbins brings out the trauma of sexual abuse through emotional monologues. Finally, it is hard to not mention Kevin Bacon. As an obsessive detective, he brings his natural charisma to one of his finest roles. Although \"Mystic River\" is undeniably an unforgettable crime drama, ultimately it is not a flawless film. If there's a minor drawback to the movie, it suffers from a disappointing ending. It's an ambiguous finale that leaves viewers frustrated with its lack of resolution. Nevertheless, fans of crime dramas will definitely enjoy \"Mystic River\" and so will movie-goers seeking taut entertainment. At a time when Clint Eastwood seems to have lost his spark as a filmmaker, it's a rousing reminder of his long forgotten talent for telling stories about traumatized men whose lives are shattered by tragedy.",

            "content": "Clint Eastwood's 2003 who did it-thriller won Best Actor in a Leading Role and Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars and was nominated for all the other categories in addition to Best Picture. As you can already see from the wins for the actors, the great strength of this film lies in its performances. But with Eastwood's great direction and its electrifying suspense, the film brings many other great elements to the table. Mystic River tells the story of three childhood friends who drifted apart after an incident. Decades later, none of the three have left their hometown and a tragic event occurs. This brings the friends and their loved ones back together in very different roles.\n\nSean Penn won his first major Oscar for his embodiment of a family man with a criminal past who is out for revenge after a violent stroke of fate. In the course of this, the demons of the initially quite normal small-town resident crystallise, giving his character entirely new facets. This transformation is perfectly realised by Penn. What can be classified as passive-aggressive for the most part develops into escalation, especially towards the end. Tim Robbins, who won for Best Supporting Actor, is every bit as good as Penn with his performance, albeit in a very different way. His character, scarred by a terrible incident in his childhood, is clearly calmer, more subtle and, above all, more sensitive. Robbins brilliantly calls on all these traits, which also makes every interaction between him and Penn's character very interesting and explosive. In addition to the film's two stand outs, Kevin Bacon, Marcia Gay Harden and Laura Linney deliver strong performances. \n\nAlthough Mystic River seems like a standard murder-mystery at first impression, Eastwood manages to stage the actually banal plot fantastically with his flair for the appropriate cast, beautiful shots and an inimitable build-up of tension. You can hardly look away until the end, the resolution is unpredictable and the behaviour and communication of the characters captivate you. The only shortcoming is the ending. It seems abrupt and unsatisfactory after all the explosiveness. This film is not one for a happy ending, but Mystic River definitely deserved a more fitting finale.",

That's not to say it isn't an enjoyable film — it features fantastic acting all around, but most notably from Sean Penn as Jimmy Markum. The beginning is frightening — with sex abuse from, what I believe to be, the clergy — but that really just seems to lay a superficial foundation for Dave Boyle (Tim Robbins) to be reserved, skittish, and then become a suspect in Katie Markum's (Emmy Rossum) murder. I take issue with Dave's character from a logical perspective and believe if his storyline was cleaned up, the film would've benefited as a whole. He lies about a potential murder and/or violent encounter, dials that back, admits to a different murder (of a pedophile), retracts that and admits to Katie's murder, which didn't make sense to me at all. Even if Jimmy Markum is telling you he's \"not going to kill you\" as long as you admit to killing his daughter, every viewer knows he's going to kill you once you admit to killing his daughter — his childhood friend should've known that. Robbins also won an Oscar for his role as Dave, and the acting is great, his decisions just didn't make sense to me. Also, it felt foolish for Jimmy to shoot him after he'd already stabbed him and still had a knife — people can hear gunshots. Mystic River at times feels very 2003 — I'm not sure exactly what that means — but it gets better as it builds, even if the reveal of Katie's real killer was unsatisfying.",

            "content": "Clint Eastwood's directorial career went through a rough patch in the late 1990s and early 2000s with titles such as Blood Work (2002), Space Cowboys (2000) and True Crime (1999) receiving mixed to negative critical reception. This film is generally viewed as an upswing in his career as it received a Best Picture nomination and led to future successes such as Million Dollar Baby (2004) and American Sniper (2014). Sadly I found this film to be a real disappointment as it was a tonal mess and many of the supporting characters seemed underdeveloped leaving last minute twists feeling hollow and emotional outburst difficult to believe.\n\nAs an eleven year old boy Dave Boyle, Tim Robbins, is sexually abused by two men pretending to be police officer and a priest for four days. His two friends grow up to be gangster Jimmy Markum, Sean Penn, and police officer Sean Devine, Kevin Bacon. The three childhood friends are drawn back together when Markum's daughter Katie, Emmy Rossum, is brutally murdered as Devine is assigned to investigate the case and Boyle becomes the prime suspect due to having mysterious cuts on his body and having seen Katie the night of the murder. Devine is hesitant to accuse Boyle of having been the murderer as the evidence seems circumstantial but the fiery Markum is quick to assume that his assumptions are correct and after Boyle's wife Celeste, Marcia Gay Harden, expresses doubts about her husband's innocence he takes drastic action.\n\nThe film lost me in the fact that each of the three characters had underdeveloped ‘personal problems'. Devine, possibly the least tortured character in the film, has been abandoned by his wife along with their child due to his valuing of his career over their family. She regularly calls him but remains silent, expecting him to say something, and we see that he increasingly struggles to speak with no response. This subplot does not receive an adequate payoff as Devine apologizes once and a woman who was seemingly traumatized and facing difficult emotions is suddenly ready to move back in with him and have him engage with her child. The idea of a lonely man being estranged from an unforgiving family member for vague reasons is better explored in Million Dollar Baby as we see what this rejection drives him to do and his problems remain unresolved. This is just one example of Devine feeling underwritten as although the naturally charismatic Bacon makes the character sympathetic and consistently watchable we feel slapped in the face when all of his conflicts are resolved inexplicably fast.\n\nMarkum and Boyle face the same problems as their relationships with their wives are meant to inform us of their mental states and what has pushed them to make drastic decisions such as murdering innocent men and stabbing pedophiles. Markum's wife Annabeth, played by the talented and versatile Laura Linney, is an underused character who gets one scene in which she is revealed to be a Lady Macbeth type who encourages her husband's violence and is sexually excited by it. This could be an interesting idea but the fact that it appears only once and in a scene filled with clunky dialogue means that it is hard to believe in their relationship and lines that should seem disturbing seem laughable. Similarly underused is Marcia Gay Harden, who received an Academy Award nomination for her performance as Boyle's wife, with her character seeming like a darker version of Lee Krasner in Pollock (2000). It is a shame that despite her best efforts she gets her juiciest lines in one awkwardly shot scene in which Robbins refuses to disclose what he was really doing the night of Katie's murder. Eastwood doesn't know how to slow down and let the two characters reveal their true feelings before having them yell at one another and raise eyebrows in an expression of suspicion. I wanted more out of the women in this film as we are told that they are important at the end of the film but never given any reason to believe so.\n\nFinally, the performances of Penn and Robbins were so over the top that it became impossible to believe them as real human beings. Penn is showy in every scene that he appears in with his sobbing when he discovers his daughter's death and killing of Robbins being some of his worst work. He is all tics and theatrical gestures with no depth as moments when he should reveal deeper hurt, a monologue about his love for his daughter and his fear of Robbins, display all of his weaknesses as an actor. Robbins is similarly over the top as he is not quite on point as a haunted, sad little man who wants to achieve some form of redemption. One gets the sense that if Eastwood had reined in a little their characterizations would have been deep and emotional moments would have landed with a stronger impact.",

He, along with Kevin Bacon and Tim Robbins play three childhood friends whose lives are laced with tragedy. With an intelligent, insightful screenplay and a riveting key performance, Eastwood has combined his cinematic ingredients in a mixture that is sure to get applauded. Mystic River is haunting and melancholy, and the portraits it paints of Jimmy, Dave, and Sean will stay with you after you have left the theater. In a time when the goal of most movies is to offer instant gratification with no aftertaste, this quality should be both valued and praised. Mystic River has only one misstep, and that occurs at the conclusion (and is reflective of problems with the book's final pages). Instead of ending cleanly, at the point when everything is in place for the rolling of the credits, the movie drags on for two unfortunate, unnecessary scenes. Nevertheless, this is a top movie.",

            "content": "Clint Eastwood's finest film is Mystic River.\n\nClint Eastwood's psychological mystery drama Mystic River (2003) is a harrowing journey of tragedy, trauma, and repression. Characters must deal with loss, grief, abuse, and accusations while under immense emotional pressure. Mystic River is honestly Eastwood's greatest film. He uses heavily nuanced storytelling to portray realistic people struggling with tremendous pain. Eastwood's direction just thrusts you right into the agony from childhood kidnapping to coping as an adult and brings Dennis Lehane's novel and Brian Helgeland's script to life. You are held in suspense on every word in each scene.\n\nI love how Eastwood uses shadows and dark lighting to hide or obscure faces on purpose. The lighting gives Mystic River a neo-noir feel akin to Zodiac, Spotlight, or Se7en. You never feel safe or sure. The Boston backdrop always feels potentially dangerous and dark. The narrative builds off of clues that Eastwood gives you to figure out what has happened, but I doubt you'll figure out the full truth in time. Mystic River's finale is shocking and affecting. The twists and reveals never seem to stop until you are just emotionally drained. Eastwood's direction is creative and engaging, while the brutal story is relentless. Mystic River is really Eastwood's film as he even scored it with brooding, ominous music to accompany the darkness on screen.\n\nSean Penn is truly astounding in how moving his Jimmy character is at displaying profound loss and agony. Penn plays a father mourning for his murdered daughter, while hunting her killer. His screams of rage and sorrow during his discovery of her body are haunting. Penn gives such a subtle performance of foreboding frowns and knowing glares. He earned that Best Actor Oscar he received for Mystic River. On the same note, Laura Linney is excellent as his supportive wife Annabeth with a darker tendency to overlook Jimmy's violent fury.\n\nLikewise, Tim Robbins is fascinating as a man, who experienced unimaginable childhood trauma, whose mind is deteriorating due to his inability to cope with what happened to him. Mystic River tackles childhood abuse with a careful and thoughtful perspective. It makes you feel like Robbins' character Dave is truly another victim in a long line of children taken advantage of by criminals. Robbins plays it cautious, anxious, frightened, confused, angry, and defeated as Dave. He is wonderful to watch, especially alongside Marcia Gay Harden as his sweet and devoted wife Celeste. She brings a warm chemistry with Tim Robbins that perfectly captures her character's timid nature and uncertain feelings.\n\nKevin Bacon is outstanding as a cop named Sean. His cold demeanor hides a layer of remorse and sympathy for his old friends played by Penn and Robbins. Bacon shines brightest in the end during a touching phone call from his estranged wife. Bacon pours on the nuance throughout Mystic River as he must cover his inner conflicted feelings of friendship and justice from his no nonsense partner Whitey, played by Laurence Fishburne.\n\nLastly, Mystic River features several cool cameos like Eli Wallach as the hilarious and surly shop keep. Emmy Rossum is lovely and endearing as the ill fated Katie. While she is on screen with Sean Penn, you really buy her as his daughter. Finally, Tom Guiry and Spencer Treat Clark as interesting as Katie's boyfriend and his mute brother, respectively.\n\nIn short, Mystic River is a numbing experience. You will feel assaulted by the sensory overload of apt casting, ambient scoring, complex acting, and riveting direction. Mystic River is a classic picture from Clint Eastwood.",

No attention or care is paid to the boy forced off the street and relegated to a basement hell for four days.  No one asked and no one cared.\nBut a lot apparently was happening in his head.\nPolice detective Bacon is determined to break every law of police procedure, which is not possible to do in Boston, circa 2003.  DNA is mentioned, but the power of DNA to find the killer of Robbins is feasible and there are witnesses alive.  No attempt is made to even investigate why Robbins died.\nLaura Linney, usually the best actor in Hollywood, goes batshit crazy at the end and tells her husband Sean Penn to do anything he likes -- good or bad -- and never admit to anything.  Linney makes your stomach turn.  One hopes she regrets making this bad film as it is the worst performance of her career.\nI could go on ad nauseam.  The film gets worse as it all concludes.  Life in Boston, as it is on much of the East Coast, seems even drearier and more pointless than it is.  The gray skies and rolling fog of the River Mystic encapsulate all that Eastwood has wrought ... and hopefully will evaporate it out of existence.",

But with Mystic River he's directed a movie reminding us that he was the guy who directed movies such as Bird, Unforgiven or the Bridges of Madison County. Mystic River is not a masterpiece but it's vintage Eastwood and it owes it to two things: the movie is shot with a real sense of what great classic filming is and the screenplay by Brian Helgeland. This screenplay develops lots of intersting themes: the transmission of evil through the links of blood and friendship, the way violence and the desire for revenge is reproducing eternally, the observation of small towns, their rumours, their boredom. The pessimism of the movie towards the part of evil there's in every human being is reminiscent of Fritz Lang. Overall, the tone is very dark but there's some funny moments, especially the cameo of Eli Wallach.",

The plot felt shallow, characters made no sense, there appeared to be random scenes stitched together with  one bridge or reasoning pit behind it, and there was at least two subplots that had absolutely zero payoff yet strung  you along the entire time. I struggle to think of a movie that was trying THIS hard with so little to show for it. What else came out in 2003 that THIS pile of garbage got so many awards? The movie was so incomprehensible that I filled in the gaps and apparently came up with an entirely different movie in my head.\n\nMy wife watched this with me, and the book is one of her favorites. She also thought this was a steaming pile of \"waste of our time\". After the credits rolled, while I was sitting with a look of disgust and regret, she listed off all of the plot points and character development they glossed over or straight up cut from the movie... The list was incredible. My understanding of each character and their motivation or backstory , as a movie watcher only, was entirely wrong. The characters that I thought were just generic background characters apparently were family of other characters or had some kind of significance that was lost on me.\n\nAnd holy moly, don't even get me STARTED on the audio mixing of this movie. Between their thick east coast \"fuggidaboudit\" accents to the blaring screeching cars, church bells, clanking beer cans in an ice chest, or whatever other random sound effect was thrown in to muffle the dialog... I barely understood 50% of what was said.I legitimately thought that \"young Robert Deniro\" Sean Penn was speaking in Japanese for 30 seconds in one scene and had to rewind to confirm he wasn't.  It's like the George Lucas special edition of audio cacophony. Every possible distracting and overly loud sound effect they could squeeze into a scene, they did. I feel like 2003 must have been the height of \"oh, everyone has surround sound now so well mix the SFX super loud since they'll have their own channel\". So If you're still working with stereo, avoid this movie.\n\nAnyway, my wife and I have been ranting about this waste of time and money long enough that I need to stop and try to forget this train wreck ever happened. I will finish by saying that this is the movie that made me add \"Can you refund an Amazon movie rental\" to my Google search history.",

Perfectly giving us each of their problems while focusing on the central story. Clint Eastwood directs Mystic River and it was in my opinion the beginning of him becoming the masterful director we know him as today.  Emmy Rossum of my favorite TV show since LOST is in this film. I keep digging into the crates and finding fantastic movies, making me disappointed in myself for never having seen them earlier. \n\nEveryone in this ensemble is acting his or her ass off, including Tim Robbins. Tim's character had a tragedy happen to him as a youth and it has made him a little weird as an adult. The way they keep certain things from you and focus on his idiosyncrasies is a bit like Gone Girl, pointing you in an obvious direction. Before they reveal a twist that you couldn't see coming, though there are hints throughout the picture. Kevin Bacon is quoted as saying it was his favorite film he has ever worked on and Sean Penn's scenes had me on the verge of tears. \n\nThank God for Clint Eastwood, who is sincerely focused on making great films and so often brings perfection to the screen. The scenes are a bit drawn out in this film, based on a book and the score is the perfect fit to that. The film was also scored by Eastwood! In the end you get a satisfying conclusion to this seemingly simple mystery the movie presented you in the beginning. The female characters are a bit off to me, yet they are both portrayed incredibly. & Even though the initial bit of Laura Linney's closing monologue is moving, the ends seems a tangled mess. So you wanted your husband to be a gangster? Regardless, the boys bring out the best in this movie",

Director Clint Eastwood has not only created something masterful here but he has also created a fact of losing something that means the world to you. How will you go to catch a killer? Would you kill your best friend if you thought he killed your daughter? I'll let you answer that, but it's like when Dave has changed in his personality, the whole group has changed.

(the movie doesn't tell you but you can sort of see it) There's a man in the movie who is named Just Ray, he does not appear but he gets mentioned in some conversations.

            "content": "MYSTIC RIVER\n\nWhen someone tells me I should try to be a movie critic, I have my usual excuses-that it's too competitive a field, success would be unlikely, I'm not good enough, etc.  I have others such as the reluctance to write within the restraints of canning a movie without revealing what happens, layering the critique with how it was structured, what devices were used or left out, what I thought it meant, how the performances came off and so on.  I don't even like to read reviews much anymore, let alone write one. \n\nThe riveting \"Mystic River\" has inspired me but I think that what I want to write is not a movie review but an essay of praise.\n\nI learned long ago, after seeing \"Byrd,\"  that Clint Eastwood's towering talent lies in directing, not acting.  I heard Sean Penn say that Eastwood is the only Hollywood Icon he ever worked with that turned out to be the real thing.\n\nI am in awe of his directorial prowess.  I haven't read any of the reviews but was surrounded by the Four Star buzz, and when I go into a movie expecting it to be great, there is a 90% chance of my having nowhere to go but down.  This film fell in that rare 10% slot that delivered rather than disapponted.  Like Monster's Ball, it is too visceral for me to be eager for a second viewing. I probably will see it again at some point though, because a) I almost needed a translator for the pungent accents, b) I heard dialogue so mesmerizingly complex that I was either hopping on my toes or spinning out into a dream of my own weaving.  Like momentous classical tragedy, it challenges the viewer at every turn.\n\nSet in Boston, the story begins with three boys of about ten, playing stick hockey on an urban street.  One of them is taken into a car by that lowest of human existence, a pedophile.  The movie fast-forwards thirty years with the onset of a new tragedy and from there the drama emerges with relentless intensity.  The police/crime story is compelling and taut.  \n\nThe realism is gritty, the story complicated, and the gravity is that of Shakespearian  proportions but without his interweaving of comic relief.  This is, after all, the twenty-first century.\n\nI was gripped by the neck, ripped up one side and down the other, had my heart pulled out, pummeled, and jabbed back inside me with a juicy jolt.  I was happy.  I do love a hard-hitting work of art!\n\nAs in most of my favorites, truths of living are exposed.  This entails the juxtaposition of good/evil, joy/suffering, sublime/vile, understanding/misunderstanding, humanity/depravity.  In this film they are so richly simultaneous that there is no question of our shared human experience.  Like the marvelous book Siddhartha, we are an ever-running, ever-changing, ever-volatile river of weakness and righteousness.  Not only is nothing really black or white, the gray area is so mercurial and pulsating that it may carry significant flashes of insight and miscalculation, love and hate, surrender and prideful egoism...all within a moment's glance.  The river flows on unmitigated. \n\nPeople like to say, \"the book is always better.\"  They also say a picture is worth a thousand words.  In this case, the latter applies in the greatest sense.  The performances are true, strong, clear and have a conviction that runs concurrent with the integrity of the entire film.  Facial expressions carry the weight of entire chapters.  \n\nMovie fans may exit this movie with the belief that loyalty is the greatest of all virtues.  They may then wonder what boundaries loyalty has in the eyes of God or man.  They may also wonder--as I do--if the many questions of life are simply too ambiguous to be labeled, understood or answered by mere mortals.  Perhaps that \"explains\" an ending with some things clear while others remain enigmatic.  \n\nIf you go to the movies for special effects, escapism, or warm fuzzies, this is not the ticket for you.  If you regard film as experiencing an art form it is a must-see, as Eastwood is an artist of the highest order.",

I stumbled across it last night, but this time I watched it with subtitles. I'm not sure why I chose subtitles, but I'm glad I did. Whilst all the acting is perfection, it made me realise why Penn, Robbins, Fishburne and other actors of their caliber are so revered: They speak the lines clearly. There was one supporting actor in Mystic River who, whilst acting very well, I realised I was missing a lot of his dialogue. However, with subtitles, I got so much more of the plot! So much more, and I now realise why it's regarded as a masterpiece. Highly recommended!",

However, he proved everyone wrong, and his adaptation of Dennis Lahane's book boosted his career. Set in Boston, it begins in 1975 when a horrible incident changes the lives of Jimmy Markum (Jason Kelly), Sean Devine (Connor Paolo), and Dave Boyle (Cameron Bowen), when Dave is sexually assaulted by two men claiming to be policemen. 25 years later, and Jimmy (Sean Penn) is an ex-con who is running a store, Jimmy (Tim Robbins) is a blue-collar worker who is married to Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden), and Sean (Kevin Bacon) is a police detective working with Sergeant Whitey Powers (Laurence Fishburne). When Jimmy's 18 year old daughter Katie (Emmy Rossum) goes missing, and the same night it happened. Dave turned up late at home with blood on his hands, claiming he was attacked by a mugger. Jimmy suspects that Dave did it, or did he? It's a very dark mystery, but it has some brilliant performances in it, (Penn and Robbins won Oscars for their turns as broken men), it's not a film for everyone, but Eastwood's unfussy direction suits this style of film, and it was this and the Oscar success of Million Dollar Baby (2004) the following year that made Clint bankable again, and showed audiences what a fine director he is.",

Only Kevin Bacon seemed to me to be operating at the right frequency, and when the best thing about your movie is Kevin Bacon, you're in trouble.

It leads for the chilling interactions as old friends are pitted against one another, and the strength of the actors in those roles - Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon - certainly helps move the story along and make it as engaging as it turns out to be.\n\nAlso starring Laurence Fishburne, Marcia Gay Harden and Laura Linney, the film's bleak atmosphere sets a great tone for the horrid tragedies that plague this film. It's not a fun party film, but for those who like some really well-made drama with some unforseen twists (although the big answer becomes apparent reasonably early if you've seen this sort of film before), then this is the film for you.",

Combined with an superbly talented cast, Brian Helgeland's strong script and Tom Stern's (a frequent Eastwood collaborator) haunting cinematography that beautifully captures the dark, dreary atmosphere of a murder mystery, Eastwood delivers one of his finest directing efforts.\n\nFull review at http://silverscreenfanatic.com/2014/06/17/benjamins-stash-24/",

Surprisingly though, the actors portray \ntheir characters very believably and extremely powerful. Sean Penn gives a really strong performance so much so that I feel his emotions being, put into this character. Tim Robbins plays a strong support character and by being the most damaged character of the movie. He portrays himself as psychologically damaged and emotionally devastated by his experience in his childhood. Finally Kevin Bacon plays in my opinion his best role I have ever seen, as the main detective on the case of the murder. His character is insightful, articulate, strong, soft, and dedicated to his job. I can say that I really liked this movie and can't find too many flaws. Though I will say, if you're wanting action, this movie will not deliver. This movie is more about the dialogue, characters, and performances.

            "content": "I have seen some dark, sad movies in my years. Ones that make me feel bad, make me feel sad, make me cry. Most of them, I have to say though, are Cllint Eastwood movies. Clint Eastwood is a master of film and this is one of his absolute best. But it's always interested me as to why he chooses to engross you into a film and make you feel terrible at the end. His films are not bad by any means but Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby both were very depressing, and proved to make me feel unhappy at the end. Either the characters get what they don't deserve, die, or just end up turning bad. Good characters we care about that squeeze our hearts with pain whenever they die. It's hard to watch this, but films like this are amazing. When you feel depressed from a depressing movie really has something to say from the script and acting. The directing is what does this to you, and maybe a genre like this should be in it's own category. Because, truly, depressing films arent just dramas. They show the sadness in film and in the world we live in, and it affects us like no other ever will. Truly one genre that should be its own. And Eastwood perfects every bit of it.\r\n\r\n   Mystic River is a 2003 crime drama starring Kevin Bacon, Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and Marcia Gray Haden. It's directed by Clint Eastwood and written by Brian Helgeland. I give major props to Helgeland for writing such a compelling and gripping tale. It's based off the book of the same name, but still holds up very well on the screen. The character development from the characters is excellent all due to the screenplay and how much time it gives each character and how much background we get from each into their professional and personal and intertwining lives. It's excellent the way he puts the characters together and how their lives seperate and come back. The dialogue is great and keeps you captivated through the film. Helgeland writes an excellent film not many other people write like. He doesn't give us what we want in this movie; justice. And as you watch the film's ending and final scenes, I think the film was great that way. Be writes great scenes, writes great tension, and writes a one of a kind film.\r\n\r\n   Clint Eastwood's direction, like I said, is stupendous. He truly pulls us into the screen and makes us believe that the tragedy that is in this film is a tragedy we experience ourselves. We feel the loss of the characters, the loss of the town, and the loss of the lives. Eastwood sends the film down a road that not many want to venture too, and not many viewers would go too. But every viewer should go down the road of the film, and every viewer will feel the pain that Eastwood wants you because honestly it's strong pain. One scene in the end shows two characters talking to each other, and a car is driving ahead of them as they remember an event that happened years ago. After we see the shot of the car, the film cuts back to the characters, the camera zooming away. As if it's leaving these two characters behind and leaving their souls and life their as well. Although Mystic River extremely lacks any amount of lightheartedness, Clint Eastwood still manages to entertain as the film indulges deeper and deeper into darkness instead of making us turn off the film and watch something more easier to watch. But nevertheless, this film is hard to watch. But Eastwood keeps us engaged and pulled into it like he has in no other film, directing better than he did Million Dollar Baby. And although some of his are huge and involve overly dramatic cinematography, there isn't much to complain about from his work. The score he uses in this film also works well, providing a theme that's sweeping, while using a simple melody. And while some of the film seems badly developed, it's some of the best direction I've seen in a while, despite some of the cinematography. But the true leader in this film is not wholly from the direction, but from the acting. The brilliant acting. Sean Penn gives the best performance I've ever seen from him second to only Milk. His pain is felt through out, and while I felt he over did it at times, by the end he was so good. And while he won Best Lead Actor at the Academy Awards, it wasn't him that lead the film; it was Tim Robbins. Tim Robbins plays a broken-down stay at home dad that the film's major events seem to lead too, and his portrayal of a man who was *SPOILERS* molested as a child was unlike anything I've seen him do. He was broken down, hopeless, haplessness, and in total already a dead man. His performance was so good, so well executed, and so real it helped me to understand the pain he felt, and he wholly deserves an Oscar for his performance. Kevin Bacon also gives one of the big performances, and he also does well, throwing the sensible and calm side of the film to the viewers and giving them a break whenever he was on screen. He also deserves an Oscar nomination for his performance, for it's memorable and also well done. Another outstanding performance comes from Marcia Gary Harden, who plays the wife of Tim Robbins. It's she who the films main villain might be, who leaves a man who should've been happy to sadness, therefore leaving the audience to sadness, and anger. I greatly disliked her character in this movie, and she portrays that hatred we are supposed to film on screen. Still, she's great, and deserves all the praise she can get for this film. All of the actors have one flaw though; their accents. While the accents seem authentic and real, they are also terribly hard to understand and takes me out of the movie sometimes. The cast in total is good, though, and so great and outstanding that they might possibly be one of the greatest ensembles I've seen on film.\r\n\r\n   In all, Mystic River is really good. Eastwood directs a film like no other out there, combining thrill with emotion at the same time like not many other films have. While your heart pounds from suspense, it also pulls its strings and its anger, providing a movie experience not like many other. One scene (or two scenes) in particular made the movie for me and proved it to be so good combining everything this movie felt like from start to finish. The acting was so good and was the most memorable part of the entire film, with Tim Robbins stealing the movie. And while some of the accents may be to strong, it was as good as it could ever be. The direction is overly dramatic at times, but then at others it works, and shows Eastwoods skill as a director like no other film of his has. In the end, this movie made me sad. It made me angry. It made me depressed. It made me feel hurt like no other film ever has. And I loved it gave me those feelings. 8/10.\r\n\r\nAnd please, if you are interested in hearing my thoughts or listening me talk more about this film, check out my podcast!

But it's not a story to love, and there are a few things in the wrap-up that play a little thin. It's also surprising that as good as the acting is, with the exception of a scene early on with Penn I didn't feel that gut-wrenching anguish that, thinking back, I really should have. I will happily concede that Mystic River is, in one sense or another, a masterpiece; it's just not a film that will stick with me like a Shawshank.",

Every aspect of this film was firing on all cylinders: writing, acting, directing, cinematography, editing, sound and so on. For a drama, this is about as flawless as it comes. Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon lead this film in a truly fascinating direction and do so with supreme performances. As good as the latter two were, Sean Penn easily outpaces them in providing the performance that will absolutely make this film live on. If you haven't seen this, it's an absolute must watch.

E podemos dizer que Mystic River é o melhor exemplo disto.\n\nQuanto um trauma sofrido pode influenciar na vida de uma pessoa? Ou melhor, o quanto pode abalar o destino de todas as pessoas envolvidas? Jemmy, Dave e Sean são garotos americanos comuns, de personalidades diferentes. E logo no começo, uma cena é importantíssima para o resto da história: os três estão brincando na rua de basebol e Dave deixa a bola cair num bueiro. Logo após, decidem cada um decide escrever o próprio nome no cimento fresco de uma calçada, dizendo que aquela marca ficaria para sempre. Sean e Jemmy são os primeiros a escrever, mas Dave é interrompido na metade de seu nome quando um carro com dois homens que se passam por detetives da polícia chega no local. Com um tom agressivo, Dave é forçado a entrar no carro e ali começaria o seu maior drama. Na verdade, os dois homens o levaram para um local isolado e o estupraram por durante 4 dias, até conseguir escapar do local. Anos se passaram, os amigos haviam praticamente se separado e cada um dos três formaram suas próprias vidas. Porém, outra tragédia acontece e a vida, ironicamente, reaproxima-os. E é nesse ponto que o clímax inicia. O lado psicológico de cada personagem entra em jogo. Logo, mergulhamos em um mundo cheio de intuições, aparências e vaidades banhados num realismo digno de aplausos.\n\nE é nesse ponto que percebemos que Clint Eastwood não só nos presenteia com um dos melhores dramas do cinema moderno, mas também com uma trama policial de uma competência pouco vista nas telonas. A construção de cada detalhe é feita de maneira minuciosa pelo cineasta e em nenhum momento o ritmo da narrativa cai. Pelo contrário, a história se torna mais interessante a cada minuto passado.\n\nPor mais grandiosa que seja a direção, a cereja desse bolo tem quer creditada ao elenco, simplesmente maravilhoso. Sean Penn, Tim Robbins e Kevin Bacon interpretam com alma seus respectivos personagens a ponto de envolverem totalmente o espectador na história. Em vários momentos, parecia que eu não estava diante de uma obra cinematográfica, mas sim dentro daquelas cenas tamanho o choque de realidade que o filme proporciona. A gente se coloca no lugar de cada um deles e percebemos que as críticas ao comportamento humano é totalmente escancarado por Eastwood.\n\nO ato final de Mystic River é totalmente perturbador e causa agonia. Quando os créditos finais começam a rolar na tela, temos a satisfação de ter apreciado um filme sensacional que funciona perfeitamente como drama, policial e suspense. Obra-prima, sem dúvidas!",

I absolutely LOVE this film and everything about it, the acting especially, the directing, the lighting effects (notice the great lighting in Dave's son's room when he's reading him a bed time story) the flow of the film, the story; EVERYTHING. Penn plays Jimmy Markum a tough, old school dude who's had a rough past life but now has a wife (Laura Linney) and three daughters, the oldest one being Katie (Emmy Rossum) Jimmy has two childhood friends: Sean who now is a cop (played by Kevin Bacon who never ceases to impress me with his acting) and the disturbed and troubled Dave (Tim Robbins) who now only just say 'hello'  every time they see each other. They end up being drawn back to each other after Jimmy's oldest daughter, Katie, is killed and then that's when the story really begins to unravel as to who killed Katie. \n\nEverything that unfolds towards the discovery of Katie's killer from getting clues, interviewing suspects and witnesses alike, and putting everything together is masterfully directed by Eastwood and expertly written by Brian Helgeland. These  clues and interviews are being conducted by Sean and Whitey (Laurence Fishburne in a very interesting role) you would think that the film drags while the plot unravels but not at all, it keeps you sucked in all the way to the surprising ending. \n\nBut the thing that keeps me coming to the film is not only the plot and directing, but the acting. Laura Linney plays Annabeth, Jimmy's wife, she brings calm to Jimmy's life and Marcia Gay Harden plays Celeste, Dave's wife who at times is confused about her husband's demeanor. Both Penn and Robbins deserved their Oscars that year because that scene where Penn runs towards the crime scene to see if its his daughter is powerful \"Is that my daughter in there?\" And the scene where Jimmy admits to Dave that its pissing him off because he can't cry for his daughter AND THEN finally does cry is emotional; its acting at its finest. The film is set in Boston and it  seems like filmmakers like filming there because we're seeing more and more films set there like GONE BABY GONE and THE TOWN most notably, its a great setting for a film. Overall if you want to see a powerfully acted, masterfully directed and well written film (which there are a few nowadays) you can't go wrong with this one. \n****",

So you watch it wondering when that's gonna happen, knowing that it'll be near the end because the s*%! is gonna hit the fan when she does. Also, near the end Markum's wife has some weird lines that sounded like total BS to me, and Lawrence Fishbourne's skeptical character is suddenly MIA. This all must've made sense on some late night brainstorming session when they were trying to figure out how to move the story along, but it didn't make sense to me. Other than that, it was fine.

The thing that catches you is the acting proficiency of the principal actors; they took their time to study their characters, with Tim Robbins to me, being the most effective of them all.\n\nEastwood directorial prowess is showcased in this flick; he takes you on a Journey of social decadence, the pains of betrayal and the unlikely implication of child molestation. \n\nMystic River was shot in Boston, and it is an adaptation of the 2001 novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane.\nThe book and movie plot is about three boys who grow up as friends in Boston, Dave (Tim Robbins), Sean (Kevin Bacon), and Jimmy (Sean Penn). While the boys were playing around in the neighbourhood street Dave was abducted by child molesters who were pretending to be police officers. \n\nAfter days of regular molestation Dave escapes and finds his way back home, but the trauma of the molestation messed him up emotionally and mentally making him a little unstable and hard to understand.\n\n25 years in to the future Sean has grown to become a homicide detective, Jimmy is an ex-convict who currently runs a convenience store, and Dave has a blue collar job, still haunted by his abduction. Jimmy and Dave are related by marriage, with Dave marrying Jimmyâ(TM)s sister.\n\nJimmy's daughter disappears one night and her body is found brutally murdered, coincidentally Dave comes home to his wife covered in blood and rattling that he fought off a mugger and \"bashed his head into the concrete\", and possibly killed him. Sean is then assigned to investigate the murder, and the three childhood friends meet up again.\n\nNominated for six Academy Awards, which Sean Penn won Best Actor and Tim Robbins won Best Supporting Actor (those where the two awards the movie went home with), making Mystic River the first film to win both awards since Ben-Hur in 1959.\n\nThe movie also won two Golden Globe Awards for Sean Penn and Tim Robbins, in the Best Actor and Best supporting Actor category. With Penn and Robbins wining many more accolades from other not so notable awardees.\n\nMystic River is a classic movie, that holds its own in the collation of greats, and it is one that I advice any movie lover to go buy this off the shelf. This is a DVD that you will like to tell others that you own.\n\nwww.lagsreviews.com",
