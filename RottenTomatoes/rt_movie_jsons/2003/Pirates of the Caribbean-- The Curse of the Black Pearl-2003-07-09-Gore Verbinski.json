The villain is just as memorable as the hero. The supporting cast is all really good too. The cinematography is where this truly shines and envelops you in this world. the set design, lighting, costumes, props, and loads of special effect with a  limited amount of CGI all works to create a unique, fun and memorable experience. The fights are awesome with most being practical effects and the CGI is more fun than scary which works here well. The music is amazing as well and one of the best title tracks ever as well. The editing is very good although the first 30-40 minutes it jumps around a bit but you can overlook that because of how it envelops you in this world with the ascetics and quirky performances. The pacing is phenomenal as well.  the only minor complaints is there are a few farfetched moments like the end when Turner throws the sword under Deeps feet and when on the island the ship happens to be the one that is carrying the Commadore. But honestly it is so charming, fun and well done it's totally easy to overlook. Anyone should give this a watch, its a great fun time.",

They tried something new with this movie and I think it worked out great. Introducing supernatural elements to this pirate adventure makes this film a lot more interesting. It also opens the door for much greater stories to be told. The characters of this movie aren't what I expected. The characters are often humorous and silly which, I admit, adds a lot of charm. From swordfights to ship battles, the action in this movie is also very good, especially the final duel. In conclusion, this is a good movie that experimented with a unique concept and opened the doors to many greater adventures.",

The cinematography in this movie is great but it does have some grain but it actually adds so much atmosphere to the movie, I love the product set design, the fight scenes looks hard hitting even with the special effects of all the pirates looking like zombies. Some scenes look so cinematic and it's close ups is amazing, you can see the eye colours, pimples of people faces and even the dirt, that is why it would be a dream to watch these movies in 4k. The sound is obviously amazing, the pirate music hits hard, they didn't try to modernize the music by having modern music in it, they went full out pirate themed on the music and it actually works so well. They don't have music playing continuously, they out the music at the right time leaving us with sound effects making the scenes so much more immersive. The story is really good, though either the pace is rally slow or they have so much happening at once, you either trying to hear what they are talking about or you glued to the screen watching sword fights and gun battles. But overall it's all just amazing. You can never go wrong with Pirates of the Caribbean.",

Putting that aside, this is a truly wonderful film, that is definitely one of the highlights of 2003. The whole film is a wonder to look at, with splendid costumes and very realistic sets. The script is just a gem, with classic and original lines like \"Stop blowing holes in my ship,\" that sometimes have you in gales of laughter. I did find the pirates as skeletons quite frightening though. Films that have scared me are The Mummy and Pitch Black. The performances were first-rate, especially Johnny Depp in possibly his best performance. His character Jack Sparrow is a somewhat charming, likable rogue, and Depp pulled him off to perfection. As Barbossa, Geoffrey Rush positively sinks his teeth into his role, sometimes sinister and sometimes fun. Kiera Knightly proves once again that she looks lovely in period dramas, because it really does suit her. Orlando Bloom is dashing as Will Turner. Before I round off, I want to mention another aspect of the film, the music by Hans Zimmer(Lion King)... it was outstanding! Zimmer should be up there with the great film composers, like James Horner(American Tail, Titanic), John Williams(ET, Home Alone) and the late Jerry Goldsmith.(Legend, The Shadow) All in all, a highly entertaining film! 10/10 Bethany Cox.",

            "content": "Swash and buckle.  I somewhat doubt that you need me to tell you what this is about, but just in case you forgot: you've got a blacksmith's apprentice (Orlando Bloom), a governor's daughter (Keira Knightly), and a scoundrel pirate (Johnny Depp).  Their paths are on a collision course, and when you add undead pirates with hurt feelings to the equation, that will only complicate the situation.  I've been meaning to rewatch this one for a minute because it is so much fun.  You can say what you want about the sequels; I personally think they have their moments, especially Dead Man's Chest, but I understand why people view them as fodder for the Hollywood blockbuster machine.  With The Curse of the Black Pearl, I doubt you will find many out there who want to argue a case against it.  Now, as you may already be aware, this is a movie that is based on a Disney theme park ride.  Not many movies originate from park attractions, and even fewer are worth talking about, but the first Pirates is the exception to the rule.  Appropriately enough, the movie itself feels like an exciting ride, and there are very few lulls to be found from start to finish.  The pacing is dynamite, and even though the runtime is approaching two and a half hours, you don't feel it since there is perpetual forward movement.  Pirates made a huge imprint on pop culture, and for better or worse, it unlocked the quirky performance library of Johnny Depp.  It's arguably his most iconic role to date, and you can tell he had the best time making this movie.  Bloom and Knightley also bring a lot to the table, but I think it is Geoffrey Rush as the main antagonist Barbossa that doesn't get nearly enough credit for his performance.  He always feels like a threat, and whenever he pops up, you're just waiting to hear what he will say next.  When I think of movies that aim to entertain, this is one of the most successful movies out there.  It has so much natural charisma that it is just downright infectious to watch.  It's so much fun to watch allegiances shift on a dime, and it has the perfect energy that you want to see in a blockbuster.  I will say that the CGI hasn't aged the best, which is a little tough because it is so reliant on the special effects for these ghost pirates.  It can also be tough to get this to the television as often as I would like because of the longer runtime, even though I wouldn't cut anything out.  Still, those are minor quibbles for an otherwise massively pleasing megahit.",

Fantastic use of imagery, the cinematography is insanely good and well thought out. Beautiful use of lighting. I love how they cut to Elizabeth waking up right after she sees the ghostly pirate ship in her dreams. Pretty spooky. It keeps you anticipating and interested. The CGI is actually impressive, especially for its time. This movie has a very cheeky and silly sense of humor. What an iconic character, I honestly can't see anyone else playing Jack Sparrow other than Johnny Depp. He is Jack Sparrow. He really does have a knack for clever and witty humor. It's impressive how well they nail the whole look, style and aesthetic of the 1700's. It almost feels like I'm watching a movie that takes place in the world of Assassin's Creed Black Flag. Plenty of exciting moments keep it from becoming boring or bland. The sword duels and ship fights being one of them. The whole movie has a great comedic flair to it. The set pieces and designs are wonderfully crafted. \n\nUnfortunately, this is one of those movies where if you've seen it once, you've seen it a hundred times. The story isn't really anything special that leaves you thinking after the credits roll, it's more of a ride that you enjoy taking part in. It felt like the movie could've benefitted if it had cut a couple of scenes short or had not shown them at all. It felt like the pacing was excellent at the beginning but then towards the middle, it lagged a bit, showing scenes that we didn't necessarily need. If they would've shortened the movie to about 1 hour 50 something or close to the 2 hour mark, I think it would've been better. \n\nOverall, it's a fun adventure pirate movie with exciting sequences, funny moments, tight camera work and one of the most iconic characters, and that's really it. The story didn't really wow me, it felt kind of vapid, and some of the characters felt bland since there wasn't any interesting character development going on. But more than anything, it was too long. I would recommend it, but I think everyone and their grandma has seen it already.",

The script is just a gem, with classic and original lines like \"Stop blowing holes in my ship,\" that sometimes have you in gales of laughter. I did find the pirates as skeletons quite frightening though. Films that have scared me are The Mummy and Pitch Black. The performances were first-rate, especially Johnny Depp in possibly his best performance. His character Jack Sparrow is a somewhat charming, likable rogue, and Depp pulled him off to perfection. As Barbossa, Geoffrey Rush positively sinks his teeth into his role, sometimes sinister and sometimes fun. Kiera Knightly proves once again that she looks lovely in period dramas, because it really does suit her. Orlando Bloom is dashing as Will Turner. Before I round off, I want to mention another aspect of the film, the music by Hans Zimmer(Lion King)... it was outstanding! Zimmer should be up there with the great film composers, like James Horner(American Tail, Titanic), John Williams(ET, Home Alone) and the late Jerry Goldsmith.(Legend, The Shadow) All in all, a highly entertaining film! 10/10 Bethany Cox.",

It's a fresh take on old ideas and given a polish that only the most competent craftsmen (and women) can achieve.  It's not going to appear on many Best Of All Time lists, and in many ways it shouldn't - it's just filmmaking at top-tier master-class level, and with excellent writing to boot.",

In 2003, no one was exactly anticipating Disney's live-action adaptation of one of their oldest and cheesiest theme park attractions. However, Gore Verbinski (The Cure For Wellness) directs with such energy and creativity that the story is exhilarating. It's a scary tale about ghost pirates, romance and rum, plenty of rum. The set pieces are well-conceived and feel alive with a palpable sense of history. Johnny Depp's (Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas) iconic creation of Jack Sparrow carries the picture. The way he walks and the way he talks, he just inhibits the character perfectly. Opposite him is the incredible Geoffrey Rush (The King's Speech). Playing the perfect antagonist, the pair riff of each other brilliantly. The Curse Of The Black Pearl remains a rarity that not only met my expectations but exceeded them. I can clearly recall after leaving the cinema in the summer of 2003 eager to see it again.",

He has an understandable motivation. Every character is just so interesting and well acted. What stops this movie from being a 5/5 is some lazy writing where characters just appear from one place to a next as though they just apparated even though the task should've been difficult and it's a bit too long.

Low ceiling, but super low floor (Live action remakes, Artemis Fowl, John Carter ect.). In this metaphor the first three Pirates of The Caribbean movies get to join Mighty Ducks in the attic above the apartment because the franchise is actually pretty good. \n\nThe first movie is the weakest of the trilogy however, but still it stands on its own as a solid entertaining pirate adventure. Johnny Depp stars as Jack Sparrow, the world's best pirate, so it may seem anyways. The movie centers around his former crew, trying to reverse an ancient curse by returning once stolen gold. May as well spoil my opinion right away but I believe this curse is the weakest part of the movie. The pirates are immortal as long as the curse is active so any sword fight with them can only end in a loss or a temporary victory. This made the climax of the film kinda boring, as it's just a waiting game to see when the pieces will be returned.\n\nThe cast of characters is the movie's strongest aspect and thankfully it takes full advantage of it. Jack Sparrow is goofy, but still incredibly savvy and competent. He never seems immortal or untouchable; he faces true peril and struggle. For such a recognizable figure he loses so much and that's fully for the best. He loses his ship, crew, friends, gets captured and then Jailed for his crimes! Fortunately for him meets the world's second biggest simp, behind Jack from Titanic, Will Barton. \n\nWill Barton is my second favourite character in this entire franchise, a man whose attraction to Elizabeth's see's him giving up his entire life, home, moral code and career just to deliver her to her fiance. True white night right there, pokimane tier 3 subs and got shit on my man Will. \n\nElizabeth Swan is a capable damsel in distress with an interest in pirate culture, for some reason. It's never really explained, but it's helpful regardless. She's fine, moving on. \n\nThe comedic relief shines in this movie. The two pirates are the stars of the franchise in my opinion, they're just fantastic. Pintel and Ragetti absolutely steal the show, delivering the most comedic lines and the most memorable scenes. \n\nIn conclusion, while the finale is lacking in steaks, the movie overall is great. Fun action scenes, great comedic relief and comedic tone. The pirates movie is a solid movie.",

Every action scene is filled with colourful visuals, both practical and CGI, and the ride this film takes the audience on is one to behold. Keira Knightley as the damsel in distress in the first half of the film is pretty lame, but she does grow and become likeable by the second half (aside from her bad action girl line about the corset), and I never had any issues with Orlando Bloom's Will Turner. The soundtrack is iconic, even if the plot is simplistic, but the clever writing makes up for it, and then some - the lines in this are cracker.

            "content": "A highly entertaining family adventure on the high seas!\n\nGore Verbinski's romantic fantasy swashbuckler Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003) is a fast paced blast of constant laughter and exciting action. Gore Verbinski's direction incredibly balances slap stick and witty humor alongside daring adventure. His unique vision of funny comedy, tender romance, and scary horror elements work wonders for Pirates of the Caribbean as a quick corsair adventure that any family can watch. Gore Verbinski is an excellent director with a real style and atmosphere that contributes a genuine love of sailing, pirates, and swashbuckling to this film full of sword fights and cannonfire.\n\nJohnny Depp is phenomenal as the likable Captain Jack Sparrow, who outwits his enemies all over the high seas. He's funny and endearing, so much so that you always root for Jack to get out of all his precarious nautical situations. Geoffrey Rush is outstanding as Captain Hector Barbossa with his cheery pirate laugh, gnarly speech, and intimidating presence. Orlando Bloom is cool as a blacksmith turned pirate for the sake of love named Will Turner. He's an endearing lead actor with a fun chemistry alongside Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow.\n\nKeira Knightley is wicked as the fiery Miss Elizabeth Swann. Her sense of adventure and mischief are obvious thanks to Knightley's spirited performance as Pirates of the Caribbean's leading lady. Miss Swann is simply a wonderfully complex character.\n\nJack Davenport is aptly prudish and stuffy as the British Commodore James Norrington. Jonathan Pryce is funny as the traditional family values loving Governor Weatherby Swann. Kevin McNally is entertaining as the steadfast first mate to Captain Jack Sparrow called Joshamee Gibbs. He's a likable staple of the series alongside David Bailie's mute and parroted Cotton. Zoe Saldana is great as the feisty Anamaria. I wish they used her more throughout the Pirates franchise.\n\nI must mention how hilarious Lee Arenberg is as the stout and grumpy Pintel. He's quite imposing in this first one with perfect line delivery for \"hello poppet.\" I adore Mackenzie Crook's portrayal of the gaunt and gangly pirate Ragetti. Crook is hilarious with his endless literary references, false eye, and good nature. I should also shout out Giles New and Angus Barnett's as the two argumentative Navy guards Murtogg and Mullroy, respectively. They are such a funny comedy relief pairing akin to Arenberg and Crook's Pintel and Ragetti.\n\nDariusz Wolski's cinematography looks breathtaking for every wide shot of the ocean, a sunrise, or pirates advancing. His panning shots sweep around the swordplay to make every action scene riveting and enthralling to watch! Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio's script is fantastic with clever jokes that make Captain Jack Sparrow a hilarious hero and a cunning foe for the Royal Navy to contend with constantly. Their story is phenomenal as they tell a compelling tale about greedy pirates cursed by Aztec gold on a quest for their salvation. That is just as engaging as a young blacksmith's journey into piracy alongside a vetern, disgraced pirate captain to save his bonnie lass.\n\nArthur Schmidt, Stephen E. Rivkin, and Craig Wood's editing makes Pirates of the Caribbean a brisk 143 minute epic adventure that never gets old. Klaus Badelt's score is unforgettable. Hans Zimmer always gets the credit for composing the Pirates of the Caribbean's music, but Klaus Badelt actually made the music for The Curse of the Black Pearl. It's exhilarating and inspiring with memorable melodies and pulsing rhythms. Penny Rose's pirate costumes look realistic and period correct with tons of added details that make each character look unique. Ve Neill's make-up is excellent and intriguing as he gives each pirate their own style in appearance.\n\nThe CGI was groundbreaking for the cursed skeleton pirates in the moonlight that still looks amazing. Brian Morris' production design is astounding in that they built real pirate ships and large galleons for the sets. All the practical stunts and minimal use of special effects makes Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl timeless. This is how adventure blockbusters should be crafted by a loving crew.\n\nI love this franchise and The Curse of the Black Pearl remains the greatest pirate adventure movie of the whole bunch.",

            "content": "\"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl\" defied the odds of becoming a mainstream and critical success by being a movie based on a theme park ride. The story is well-written with interesting characters. Johnny Depp plays Captain JAck Sparrow and is a constant scene stealer. He is a well-rounded anti-hero and provides some comedic relief occasionally. However, Depp is not the only actor stealing scenes in this movie. Geoffrey Rush plays Captain Barbosa and does phenomenal in the role. Rush has campy and great lines and makes them all flow naturally. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley have good chemistry and make a believable romance. Although the love story is not completely fleshed out, it still adds something on top of action. The action is thrilling and although the effects are a bit dated (this movie was made in 2003) they are not terrible by any means. I think one thing that makes this movie so rewatchable is the amazing score composed by Klaus Badelt and produced by Hans Zimmer. The music adds adventure and excitement as well as tension and suspense. This movie is fun and immersive, much like the ride at DisneyLand and DisneyWorld. The script is well-written, there are some campy lines, but then that is to be expected in a swashbuckling pirate flick. This is the best film in the series for sure. It is by no means a perfect film, but it is a fun and exciting movie that will keep you glued to the screen until the last frame. Overall, I give this movie an 8/10.",

            "content": "Much like another early 2000s hit, Shrek (2001), it is difficult to remember what all the fuss was about when it came to this film as a series of awful sequels and the fact that Johnny Depp essentially plays this role in life. At the time however it was a big sensation and critically acclaimed enough to earn Depp an Academy Award nomination and while I had a lot of fun with it as an eleven year old I did not like it as much when I rewatched it recently. I liked seeing a young Keira Knightley and the film did have a unique look but there are better swashbucklers out there than this.\n\nThe aristocratic Elizabeth Swann, Keira Knightley, saves the poor Will Turner, Orlando Bloom, by taking his medallion and he goes on to become a blacksmith. She encounters the alcoholic pirate Captain Jack Sparrow, when she accidentally falls into the water and he rescues her but he is arrested when her husband discovers him. She is later captured by an enemy ship but due to a case of mistaken identity she finds herself being used to ward off a curse that has befallen them. Turner has fallen in love with her and enlists Sparrow to help recapture her but he sets his sights on recapturing his former ship \"The Black Pearl\" that he held great affection for. Swann enjoys her new lifestyle greatly and is happy to be caught up in the conflict between Sparrow and his enemies. Swann is exchanged various times between the two sides and briefly flirts with Sparrow but ultimately ends up with Turner who fights for her and presents as a far more attractive love interest than the older drunk who may be a great pirate but lacks charm.\n\nKnightley was the stand out from the film to me as she has star power in spades and some of the talent that she would put to great use in later films like Atonement (2007) and Anna Karenina (2012) shines through her. She was certainly cast for her beauty and cut glass accent, traits that fit an unattainable but appealing society beauty well, yet she brings more to the role than another sex symbol from this era would have. There is a joy and a liveliness to her performance that is lacking in Bloom's effort and when you see her pick up a sword and beginning to thrust and parry you do find her somewhat convincing. She has touches of Olivia de Havilland in Captain Blood (1935) and while this film is considerably lesser than that Errol Flynn classic her capable love interest does give the film some flavor. In the era of Michael Bay films that shamelessly ogled women who served purely as sex objects there is a novelty to seeing a capable actress bring some attitude to an underwritten role and make us genuinely care about at least one of the characters in the film.\n\nIssues with the film include the fact that Sparrow is unlikable and hard to care about and Bloom is so bland that he fails as the hot young leading man. Some were swept off their feet by his lovable hellraiser and noted his \u2018genius' in doing an impression of Keith Richards for two and a half hours. With Academy Award nominations for Ben Kingsley in House of Sand and Fog (2003) and Bill Murray in Lost in Translation (2003) it is hard to see why Depp makes his way into the lineup. Fortunately he probably didn't stand a chance at winning but at least critics and audiences have caught up the fact that Depp's performance in lazy through viewing him in the lifeless sequels. It is easy to see why Bloom never quite became the major leading man that Hollywood was setting up to be as other than his hair he presents nothing of interest in this film and appears weak next to Knightley. \n\nI can't say there was anything about the film's plot that really drew me in as it was both overly simplistic and convoluted at the same time. This is what people have come to expect of the outdated genre but I long for the simplicity of The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938).",

Down below, i\u00c2\u00b4ll show which elelements are my reasons that make this movie a great film.\n\n-Scenography: All the scenographys shown in this movie, are totally realistic. Without effort, you deduce that they\u00c2\u00b4re from century XXVII, in England. It is a visual delight all the ships, extra actors\u00c2\u00b4 cloth, the curse\u00c2\u00b4 CGI, and of course al the cities, and the other secondary places where the plot advances .\n\n-Characters: Ronna Kress did a good job with the  casting. All the main characters are the best on their roles, Johnny Depp gives a very nice personality to the Captain Jack Sparrow. Keira Knigthley and Orlando Bloom make some cliches, but they work. Barbossa is maybe the best character on the movie, because the solid appearances and the dialogs he mention, are well done by  Geoffrey Rush. The secondary characters would be better in the aspect of priority, because the Barbossa\u00c2\u00b4s crew and the english army sometimes steal leadership.\n\n-Plot: the writers also reflected their effort. Making the personalities of each character wasn\u00c2\u00b4t an easy task, but they do it ok. However, this movie in some parts, its incongruous. There are many scenes that are almost impossible, for example, when will and Jack fight for first time. \nThe history its very agile; they pass through several places and this do not fill us up of information. Its a simple plot but with very well ejecutaion. \n\n-Rhythm of the plot: This is one of the best points i saw about the movie. For better comprehension, i\u00c2\u00b4ll compare this movie, with the 3rd of this franchise.\nAt the 3rd movie, the rhythm was very slow. This makes the movie boring. The rhythm sharply grows up with the final battle, and this part keeps for long time. This is the best part of the movie and one of the best scenes of the franchise. If this rhythm kept among all the movie, this would be the best one. The rhythm of the first movie, which i\u00c2\u00b4m reviewing, its fast but regular, and grows up at the climax. This makes the movie agile and consistent. There are only a few scenes that slows down a bit the plot. For example, when Jack and Will travel by the sea with the stolen ship.\n\n-Action scenes: This point could be better, but its ok. The action scenes in some cases are ridiculous, very wierd, but comical in some cases. It might be better without these strange moevement, but watching the other movies, you familiarize with that.\n\n-Script: Many movies have the mistake of the half-done scripts. In this movie, there are moments that i wished the script should be more complete, but in the most part of the dialogs, the script looked ok.\n\nMy final comment resume: Its a great film, visually incredible, and you can easily familiarize with the characters, the plot its fast and it keeps regular, but there are few moments that slow down the script for a while. My grade its 8.2. \nThank you for reading this review. \nIsaac Razo.",

            "content": "What makes up an excellent movie? Story (Plot), characters, acting, originality, music, production design, costume design, and the list goes on. In the Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl all criteria, of what makes an excellent movie, is met and I can explain why.\n\nAs a film major and studying the technicalities of a film the Pirates of the Caribbean takes number one in originality. I have never experienced a story so thrilling and adventurous that takes us on a ride that I have never seen before. This ride is the ride of a lifetime and you do not want to miss traveling the ocean sea on a pirate ship. Some might argue and say Jaws did better, but we are not talking about sea creatures. This movie takes all those old pirate movies and leaves them stranded on an island, that no one knows about, to fend for themselves as it sails away over the horizon.\n\nAs sword clang, cannons fire, pistols shot, and plunders throughout the move on ships and ports. Some can now image the realism pirates were back in the time when old pirates sailed ships to do whatever they wanted, drink till drunk, raid, and believe in tales and curses as they sailed the seas for treasure. This brought a whole new world that everyone can appreciate it and dive into it putting all other movies that were related to pirates behind them. The movie was brought to life by two distinguished actors by the name of Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, a pirate who is out to get his ship back from his nemesis Captain Barbosa, played by Geoffrey Rush, who has been cursed from stealing Aztec gold.\n\nThe story of this movie goes as young blacksmith William Turner, played by Orlando Bloom, is on a quest for love to get back and rescue the love of his life Young Elizabeth Swan, played by Keira Knightley, a governor's beautiful daughter of Port Royal. Ms. Swan has been kidnapped by Jack Sparrow's long-term nemesis Captain Barbosa in hopes to lift the curse that has been under him and his crew.\n\nAs we follow the main character, William Turner. We as the audience sympathize with him and follow his quest for love. Young William Turner is forced to team up with Captain Jack Sparrow to rescue Elizabeth Swan. As the duo of the two protagonists of the story we get a story that pushes both these characters to change and progress within the movie. Everyone loves character development in stories and this movie does with all characters in this movie even the two pirate duos, the fat and the skinny one that keeps losing his eye. Played by Lee Arenberg, as Pintel (the fat one), and Mackenzie Crook, as Ragetti (the skinny one with the wooden eye). \n\nWe cannot ignore Johnny Depp's performance in this movie. Simply is amazing. Giving the world many, and I mean many, memorable moments. Such as the first time we see him docking his ship at Port Royal standing on the main mast of the ship as is slowly sinks barely reaching the dock for him to land safely without getting a shingle drop of water on him. I love all of his plans that you think \"what is Captain Jack Sparrow doing? Is he fit to be called a pirate?\" and what do you know a cleverly devised plan behind a plan that looks outrageous to even begin with. Sometimes I just think it is merely luck, but there is more to Jack as we are led on in this movie.\n\nJohnny Depp will forever be known to the world now as \"Captain\" Jack Sparrow. Johnny Depp's performance might have stolen the show in most every scene, but if it was not for the believable acting from that finally brought the cruelty of what named a pirate in the first place by Captain Barbosa this whole story would have fallen apart. The duality and the differences in both characters but also keeping that underline foundation of what a pirate is brings the story to a more thrilling chase around the seven seas. Let's not also forget that Geoffrey continued his role as Captain Barbosa in the rest of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies alongside the famous character that Johnny Depp played because he was also as unforgettable as the notorious pirate, Captain Jack Sparrow. Good movies that has a hero and going on his quest like William turner. We need a good or even a better villain, which is what actor Geoffrey Rush did with his character. Much like the movie Avengers: Infinity War, which was only successful due to the villain (or main character) in the film.\n\nThe character of Captain jack Sparrow comes to life as he makes his way through the movie with his own theme, composed by Klaus Badelt. His music for this movie will forever be embedded into your brain and will forever live on in the Disney parks. No wonder Klaus Badelt was chosen by the famous Hans Zimmer, who is known to compose most all films for the famous director Christopher Nolan, to be his understudy and even his successor one day.\n\nWe can see in The Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, that much thought and research has come out of this movie to make a realistic pirate world. The details in the imagery of the costumes and set designs just made that fantasy pirate world of the production Jerry Bruckheimer just made it feel like the old English time when there were actually pirates.\n\nAs a grown adult, watching this movie reminded me of playing pirates back when I was a kid, playing sword fights with my other siblings. Chucking pillows as if they were cannons fired from my cannons. Those were the days.\n\nThe Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl has all of the ingredients that categorizes movies to be to be a fresh movie. Hop on and join the ride of the lifetime to sail the seven seas with the notorious pirate called Captain Jack Sparrow.",

Johnny Depps performance excellently captures the spirit of the character and the supporting cast, specifically Kiera Knightley, are also really good as well as there being a villain that isn't just a generic threat but an actually fleshed out character with a personal goal. The best parts though, are the unpredictability of the main character and the score which is arguably one of the best in cinema history.

            "content": "\"Even I love Johnny Depp, and I'm male,\" a previous reviewer declares, tongue in cheek. Well, I wouldn't go quite that far, but there's no doubt whatsoever that when I lost my heart to this film, Johnny Depp's outrageous Cap'n Jack Sparrow had almost everything to do with it. I don't normally review 'current' films, so the very fact that I'm writing this highlights an almost unprecedented event - after endless failures, Hollywood has finally rediscovered the spirit of the classic swashbuckler movie.\n\nWith hindsight, I think the one brilliant decision that was made at some point - given a modern production environment - was to *separate the roles* of hero and swashbuckler. You can then have your worthy Costner-type juvenile lead, as required, who has to Come To Terms with his Past (although his eventual fate is a trifle unexpected in conventional terms...) - *but* you can also have your essential and irrepressible swaggering rogue (of course, he totally steals the film from the moment he first appears, but *that's* no hardship!)\n\nThe moonlight special effects were overdone, in my opinion - not that they aren't believable, but that they would have been more effective if used more sparingly, for occasional flashes of nastiness rather than solid minutes of battle. However, that's a minor niggle. The stunts are energetic, highly satisfactory, *not* computerised, and on occasion even carried out by the stars :-)\n\nThe other saving grace of the production is its humour - not that there aren't a few over-arch knowing references, but on the whole it manages to send itself up without suspending disbelief in the process. Jack Sparrow's first arrival on the scene (with total aplomb aboard a steadily-sinking boat) is a prime example, as indeed are the vast majority of subsequent scenes involving this character...\n\nThe basic Romance and Rescue structure is satisfactory enough, with the addition of the requisite Feisty Female for the 21st century (though I felt the character would have been a little more historically plausible if she had been a little less liberated - she clearly possesses a stronger character than her young man, she doesn't have to strive to be his physical equal as well...) However, it is the pirates themselves who really make the film, simply by being a pack of unreconstructed and uninhibited villains (from the Jeffrey Farnol School of Historical Dialect) who are far larger than life and totally unselfconscious about it. To quote the opening words of the 'Guardian' review: \"we have been waiting [50 years] for a modern pirate film featuring someone who, in all seriousness, actually says the words, or perhaps the two-syllable single word: 'Ah-harrrrr!'\"\n\nJack Sparrow, as swashbuckler extraordinaire and consummate rogue (of course, totally honest in his own way... ahem) is the main attraction of the entire film. Not so much loopy as totally round the bend - outrageous and unpredictable (there is a running gag throughout the first part of the film where he is repeatedly described as \"the worst pirate I've ever seen\", as in \"the worst at it\", only for the preposterous tactics in question to prove spectacularly successful).\n\nThis character saves the hero in more ways than one - without him, the film would be another \"Mask of Zorro\", a rather stodgy attempt to update an old favourite for modern-day sensibilities and compensate with more and flashier sword-fighting (swashbuckling is not *about* fighting! It comes into it, yes, but it's not the point.) But together, the pair work off one another beautifully - reliability and inspired lunacy, self-doubt and cocky flamboyance, dogged devotion and shameless self-interest. The only question is which, precisely, is the sidekick...\n\nThere are two beginnings to this film, neither of them bearing any relation to the wooden costume-drama-by-numbers prologue that actually opens the movie. The moment when events start to move (it could scarcely be less subtle) is signalled by the swell of the theme music for the first time at Sparrow's initial appearance. But for me the moment when the film really took off was in that instant during his first escape, when he seizes the rope and swings up, up, and out, in a classic swashbuckler move from the past that brought it all flooding back... and my heart flew up after him into my throat, and remained enjoyably in that position until the end of the movie, when the audience began spontaneously to applaud.\n\nThe film is far from perfect - characters like Captain Norrington (*please* - 'Commodore', like 'Prime Minister', is a job description, not a form of address!) and the Governor are little more than pantomime stereotypes, with only frustrating hints of humanity to indicate that they do after all have potential denied them by the script. Annoying anachronisms slip in - \"it's okay\", \"I was rooting for you\" - most of the nautical jargon comes out with about as much sign of comprehension as a phonetic rendition of a foreign language, and Sparrow's one precious charge of powder gets soaked through often enough in the course of the plot to be utterly useless by the end. Both hero and heroine come across as wooden and thankless roles. Orlando Bloom may be costumed to look increasingly like Errol Flynn during the course of the film (was it my imagination, or does he spend it gradually cultivating a duplicate of that famous moustache?), but, alas, any resemblance ends there.\n\nBut then it doesn't really matter. It is Depp, not Bloom, who has inherited the mantle of Flynn and Fairbanks in this film. Jack Sparrow was the character who caught my imagination - and, since I'm extremely impressionable, also had a distinctly peculiar effect on the way I stood and walked for several hours later. And there's not many films can say *that*..! \u00ffay.I am nearly fifty years old. A sober grown man. With children. Children with whom I have now sat through hundreds of movies. Many of which I have enjoyed. And I am not completely hardened in my sophistication. The opening music to The Lion King brought tears to my eyes when my little ones were but wee tots. But still, these are after all just children's movies. In another life, I would never have seen them. And, really, one can't take such movies too seriously, can one?\n\nAnd so, this summer, after the ritual badgering, I dutifully trudged into yet another Disney \"adventure\" movie. Named after that tired old ride in Anaheim I first went on in 1965. I mean really, how much can you expect?\n\nAnd then, it happened. The swirling intoxication. The stunned feeling. What? Who? How? Was this a movie? Or a religious experience? Perhaps more like an addictive experience...\n\nI cannot remember ever willingly paying to see any movie not starring a relative of mine more than twice, and I can count those movies on one hand. I have now seen \"Pirates\" four times. The only thing keeping me from seeing it again is the sense that this whole thing is just getting out of hand. I cannot get enough of it. It's like walking into a painting that you never want to come back out of. My children ask, with a note of concern in their voices, \"Dad, you really like Pirates of the Caribbean a lot, don't you?\"\n\nAnd that Depp fellow. My God. I never had any idea who he was, but his name sounded like something created for a pubescent cover-boy for magazines published to hook thirteen year-old girls on make-up and bad music. Wasn't Depp the name of some hair-goo product back in the 60s?\n\nI am a straight male. I have several good friends who are gay, but have never fantasized about any gender but the female. But now I understand how women can experience swooning crushes on male film stars. He is simply extraordinary. So sly, so seductive, so canny! I read an interview in which Depp said he went through a slight depression when he had to stop playing Captain Jack Sparrow. I can see why. His inventiveness and sheer pleasure in inhabiting the character come through in every frame. How can I admit to my children that I now troll through fan websites about a former teen heart-throb?\n\nI often don't even watch the Academy Awards, and I certainly never have any emotional investment in who wins.\n\nExcept for this year.\n\nGo Jack.\n\nAnd, in a time when many big-budget movies are little more than a hodge-podge of loosely- connected \"money shots\" this movie puts all the pieces together, with a sense of fun and light-heartedness in special effects that are simply dazzling. I find myself laughing with dizzy appreciation when Barbossa barks out, \"You'd best be believing in ghost stories, Miss Turner, you're in one!\" and the grinning skeletons come into view, with Badelt's pounding score keeping time to the beat of their maniacal deck-swabbing. And then there's the scene of the pirate-ghouls slithering up from the darkened sea on the mooring cables of the Dauntless, like infernal cats stalking their prey.\n\nAnd now to the music. I can just hear the effete aesthetes dismissing this score, as Mr. Zimmerman anticipates with his winking \"overproduced by\" credit on the cover-liner. \"Bombastic.\" \"Overdone.\" \"Absurdly Stupendous.\"\n\nWell, perhaps it is, for those who spend their lives evaluating such things. To me, it is absolutely transporting. I first listened to it while doing a work-out on a rowing machine and found that I tripled my usual distance. It was like mainlining some hazardous tachycardic amphetamine.\n\nOnce again, the children were wondering, \"What's up with Daddy? Is he OK?\"\n\nPerhaps I am just losing my grip, having an adolescent movie get to me this way. But when those final credits roll, and Captain Jack narrows his eyes and says, \"Now, bring me that horizon. Drink up me hearties, yo ho\" and the music swells ... it is difficult to put into words the effect it has.\n\nAt this point my children have to yank me forcibly from the theater, lest I persist in watching the credits to the bitter end, and bid good-bye to the little monkey once more, wiping tears of exultation from my eyes.\n\nThis is not just another \"entry\" in the summer blockbust sweepstakes. It is an exquisite work of fantasy and inventiveness, a true classic, on the order of \"The Wizard of Oz.\" I do hope Depp's performance garners not just awards, but a place in the pantheon, something we old fogies -- and our gently fogeying children decades hence -- will show to our children and grandchildren like a revealed treasure. I cannot recall any movie having such an effect on me.",

Johnny Depp delivers probably his best performance as Captain Jack Sparrow, and Geoffrey Rush is perfect as Captain Barbossa. The action is exhilarating and entertaining while surprisingly kid-friendly. At the end of the day, this film set the bar so high that its sequels had very little chance of reaching it.",

Fabulous.  Elizabeth Swann?  Exceptional.  The guy with one eye?  A showstopper.  I will admit, the plot lost me at points, but I understood the gist of it.  The fight scenes were incredible: all of the swords and flips left me breathless.  I 10/10 will be recommending this movie to all of my friends.  I will be sending a petition to Netflix to make all of the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels available to stream.  Bravo!",

Understandably this lead to a huge success especially with Depp's fantastic performance as Jack Sparrow (before it became stale) Here the Character feels like it has depth and is much more than the stumbling buffoon of latter films.",

            "content": "We have to take a look at very first voyage before venturing into Salazar's Revenge, where it all begin with Captain Jack Sparrow back in 2003. But it didn't all start back in 2003. No. And for those of you, like myself, that we're fortunate or spoilt enough to visit Disney World you might know where I'm coming from. \n\nIt was one of my favourite, if not the favourite ride out of the attractions at the Disney resorts The dark ride was first opened at Disneyland in 1967 and was the last one constructed under the watchful eye of Walt Disney himself who died 3 months before the ride opened. A dark ride by definition, is a ride that takes passengers on a guided, indoor tour by a carriage of some themed sort, usually a train of seats and in this example, is a boat with a small chance of getting wet. \n\nI remember boarding the boat and as the boat departs for a pitch black tunnel, there was a skull and crossbones warning you and then chuckling to himself. Now, what follows is guided tour throughout the pirate kingdom of coves, treasure caves, ports and taverns telling the story of Pirates of the Caribbean, though it would have be surely updated and twinned with the movies. So, it's not based on a maritime novel or a video game, not even a comic but a theme park ride. \n\nThe film really captures the essence of the attraction, using some familiar characteristics and elements such as the the rum, the boisterous, drunkard-riddled taverns, the pirate songs and including the stubborn dog with the bunch of keys. My voyage there was more than twenty years ago so I can only imagine how they have upgraded or replaced the, still good, animatronics and purposefully grubby sets. \n\nAccording to writers Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio, they had a script drafted up since the early 90's which ended up in the hands of Spielberg, who had Steve Martin, Bill Murray or the late Robin Williams to play Capt. Jack Sparrow. Fortunately, Disney halted any projects, possibly because of the disappointing result of Hook. \n\nIt's not a complicated story, but it's not simple one either, with a crew of cursed undead pirates lead by a Capt. Barbossa, claiming the sea, searching for their damned treasure in hope of lifting their curse. But what an amazing curse it is, to be consumed by greed never being able to quench their thirst or cure their hunger and lust. It appears to be a big ocean out there but a relative small world as characters inadvertently cross paths throughout the franchise leaving clues to each other's history. \n\nIt's opens with the a brief but integral piece of Will Turner's origins. The now orphaned pirate boy rescued and raised on Port Royal remembering very little from where he came from, unknowing he is a small yet important part to Capt. Barbossa's quest and just by some coincidental, unfortunate events all the key characters converge and thus starts the grand adventure. \n\nRight from Captain Jack Sparrow's entrance, most of us are immediately enchanted by his quirks, mannerisms and facial expressions. His cheeky yet cunning, mischievous behaviour has been said to be influenced by the rocking greats such as his good friend Keith Richards. He's quite possibly, the best pirate you've ever seen. De Niro was originally offered the part before Depp and he gladly declined due to having doubts about the success of such a film. He wasn't the only one with doubts with the studio planning a straight to DVD release with title as just Pirates of the Caribbean with the mindset of this being a one off, though the later anticipated box office success added the Curse of the Black Pearl. \n\nWho didn't want to be Captain Jack Sparrow after watching this. His attitude and savvy was infectious, spawning thousands of pirate cosplayers and especially Captain Jack Sparrow impersonators. Depp himself has been reported to carry the costume around with him wherever he travels, donning the attire and visiting children's hospitals when able to take the opportunity. One brilliant and true story is of a girl who wrote to Depp asking for piracy advice on how to commit a mutiny against her teachers. Depp surprised both pupils and teachers by trying up, in full Capt. Jack Sparrow attire and character. \n\nI think we can all agree, no one else can play or even be seen to play Capt. Jack Sparrow, even versus the prewritten role for Hugh Jackman and the Disney's hopeful, Matthew McConaughey which is a strong sign of great character and good acting. Rush fits the bill as Barbossa, but what of the rest of the cast? There was plenty of desirables for both Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann including Jude Law, Tobey Maguire, Christian Bale, Jessica Alba and Jaimie Alexander though Bloom won the part over Heath Ledger due to him being considered a more bankable star off the back of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Knightly is sadly the weakest of the crew and could imagine others playing Swann. There's just something about her that doesn't fit right and her screen presence can actually be annoying. \n\nThe production is of an epic scale, filming on location wherever possible, though some sets doubled for the Caribbean. The costumes and props are incredibly realistic, especially using real ships like the Lady Washington that doubles at the H.M.S. Interceptor with The Black Pearl being the Millennium Falcon of the Caribbean. In fact, if you think about it, there's quite a lot of similarities to Star Wars series regarding the smuggling/piracy. It has to be noted, this was and still is one of the best produced films of all time, but that shouldn't be too surprising with Jerry Bruckheimer at the ship's wheel. \n\nKlaus Badelt composes one of my favourite all-time scores and admittedly, I went through a spate of listening to this soundtrack constantly on repeat. It's themes embody adventure, excitement, horror and comedy superbly put together that almost creates a story on its own. \n\nWitty and clever script writing which was made all the more entertaining by allowing the cast the freedom to improvise should the opportune moment arise. Depp's \"Savvy\" catchphrase and Bloom's impersonation being only two examples that wasn't scripted. It's slapstick, fast action is incredibly refreshing and exciting, especially the swordsmanship, which reminded me very much of The Princess Bride but much more creative and adventurous taking much advantage of their environment. It displays some of the best choreographed fencing in movie history. \n\nYour scallywags will love it. It is both, madness and brilliant, bringing pirates and swashbuckling adventures back into fashion, becoming the definitive pirate movie ever made. \n\nQuoting the Skull and Crossbones as you enter the ride. \n\"Psst! Avast there! It be too late to alter course, mateys. And there be plundering pirates lurkin' in ev'ry cove, waitin' to board. Sit closer together and keep your ruddy hands in board. That be the best way to repel boarders. And mark well me words, mateys: Dead men tell no tales! Ye come seekin' adventure with salty old pirates, eh? Sure you've come to the proper place.

            "content": "What has now become a multi-billion-dollar franchise once started as an ambitious risk by Disney.  Make a feature length film based on a ride at your theme park?  That just didn't seem like something logical to do at the time.  However, with a talented group of actors, a swashbuckling script, and one hell of a musical score, the first Pirates of the Caribbean is an absolute joy on all fronts.  Perhaps, never really being topped in any way by its successors.\n\nStarting a new franchise is bold these days, which is why Disney made the right move in hiring Johnny Depp as the charming and sometimes irreverent Captain Jack Sparrow.  An even better move was not leaving the entire film up to Sparrow to lead.  Complementing the zaniness of Sparrow is the elegant but fierce Elizabeth Swan and the mysterious and brave Will Turner (played by Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom respectively).  All of them are great, but may not prove to be as fun if not for the incredible visual effects, makeup, and action.  This felt like the first major blockbuster of the 21st century, and the rest of the series certainly ranks up there.\n\nOne of the best things this series, and particularly the first film, did so well is create a mythology and universe surrounding Pirates in and around the Caribbean.  It happens gradually in 'Black Pearl', seemingly allowing viewers to adapt to the unknown shores of the series without feeling overwhelmed.  A lot of it's fun swordplay and grim family history, but the supernatural elements play just as well.  Immortally cursed pirates just begin to mark the lovable weirdness of this film.\n\nAlmost as well known as the characters and the film itself is the score by Klaus Badelt and Hans Zimmer.  Zimmer is always remembered as the one who created the iconic theme, but Badelt should also be credited, as should a few other unknown composers at the time who chipped in.  But really, the movies would not be the same without the perfect music played over the action and adventures.  \n\nThis film is lengthy and does feature an annoyingly pesky English Navy who won't go away, but Geoffrey Rush's turn as Captain Barbosa and an equally (if not more) memorable turn from Depp as Sparrow makes the first film the best in the series.  As fun as the action and over-the-top humor and adventure are, the thing you can always come back to in these films are the characters.  The movies never quite captured the same entertainment as 'Black Pearl' did, but that wasn't for lack of trying.\n\n+Action & adventure are unmatched\n\n+Score\n\n+Memorable characters\n\n+Set up the mythology well\n\n-Lengthy\n\n8.8/10",
