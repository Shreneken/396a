Anything that turned out enjoyable from this film is between his signature of grasped direction and most of Pacino's performance, the rest performed mediocrely, certainly lack thereof, and nonsensically at buffering paces in childishly self-contradicting matters.

My wife and I left the theater feeling like it was a decent, somewhat entertaining movie, but certainly not great.  Most of the comments I heard from others, leaving the theater were similar;  Rather entertaining, but certainly not Oscar material.  It was only later that I began seeing the reviews that it seem to classify as one the the \"worst movies ever\".   It became politically incorrect to even suggest that you did not \"hate\" the film.   Seemed like folks just enjoyed \"dissing\" Jaylo and Ben Afflect.  Anyway, one day I might watch it again to give it a \"fresh\" viewing and try to be unbiased about in reviewing it.  Regardless, I doubt I would admit \"liking\" it, in mixed company, even if I did.  That's why I think any review of this film cannot help being biased.",

            "content": "Did anyone ask for a Bennifer movie? Anyway, Larry \"Rhymes with Really\" Gigli (Ben Affleck) is a wannabe mobster who is assigned to kidnap Brian (Justin Bartha), the federal prosecutor's mentally handicapped brother. Because Larry is such a wet sandwich gangster, he gets a surprise visit from Ricki (Jennifer Lopez) whom he resents at first, but, of course, they end up in the sack together. Things get ugly when Starkman (Al Pacino) arrives, kills Louis (Lenny Venito), and tells Larry what an embarrassment he is, but Larry and Ricki quit and take Brian to \"the Baywatch\". Gigli is one of the most oddly-concocted films I have seen, with an ill-conceived story, bizarre subplots, and performances so off-collar that the actors look confused at what's going on. Ben Affleck seems more focused on acting like an egocentric douchebag than a lesser mob man and J-Lo, despite playing a badass bodyguard, comes off as just a special needs caretaker with a hot bod. Pacino is even worse, overacting in every sentence and emphasizing every four-letter word. However, Gigli's saving grace is Justin Bartha as Brian, who is desperate to lose his virginity yet has to take abuse from Larry in almost every scene. Another special shout-out goes to Christopher Walken and his awkwardly hilarious switch from a serious interrogation to a 20-second monologue about pie. Gigli is such an odd egg to sit through and is one of the classic examples of a bad romantic comedy. (1 Marie Calendar Pie a la Mode out of 5) (It's turkey time\u2026 Gobble gobble.)",

Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck lack chemistry which does not make sense because they were romantically involved outside of the film. Jennifer Lopez does actually do a decent performance and makes it somewhat entertaining and I did enjoy seeing her talk to Ben Affleck like he was dumb throughout the film and it was fun seeing her defend Justin Bartha's character. Ben Affleck's performance is quite annoying and tries too hard to look and sound tough but instead he puts a bad impression of what he thinks gangsters in films act like and he tends to overact a lot and throws the f bomb around more than Joe Pesci did in Casino. Justin Bartha did decent in his role and did try his best to act like an autistic person and he was clearly inspired by Dustin Hoffman's role from Rain Man. Throughout the film Justin Bartha wants to go to the Baywatch which makes me wonder how long ago this was written because Baywatch was off the air for 2 years when this was made.  There is a few entertaining elements here such as Jennifer Lopez giving teenagers a lecture at a restaurant and Ben Affleck breaking their computer at the end of the scene or when Ben Affleck tells Justin Bartha the Baywatch is closed with a pretend phone call. I also enjoyed seeing Justin Bartha sing Baby Got Back. It is not a great comedy but it's not as painful as other comedies such as The Master of Disguise, Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2, and Dumb and Dumber To. I would not put it up as one of the worst movies ever made either because there is much worse like Battlefield Earth and Son of the Mask and I definitely don't think Martin Brest should have quit directing movies after this because he just hit a speed bump and I am sure he could have bounced back after this if he wanted to.

Gigli isn't even the worst film of the summer, and won't come close to the year's Bottom 10 list. I'm not going to defend the movie. I don't recommend it and, for the most part, it's an example of inept filmmaking, but it is watchable. I have to wonder if those who are coming down so hard on the motion picture have a secondary agenda. Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez are adequate- not Bogart/Hepburn but not too terrible either.

            "content": "So uh...just so you know...the trailer and poster are lying to you. The movie's not a light-hearted romcom. It's actually a black comedy with a premise that's a crossover between crime movies and Chasing Amy. Al Pacino and Christopher Walken provide the best scenes in the entire movie but this movie feels inconsistent. This is because the movie was meant to be a 160-minute-long darker, less \"romantic\" crime story with more violence than that admittedly brutal headshot and Walken would've killed Affleck at the end. But instead, Hollywood decided to cash in on Bennifer resulting in multiple rewrites. I can't say this movie is so bad it's good like The Room because I was mostly bored. I think this is one of the VERY few movies in which actors who are dating in real life lack chemistry in the movie that's meant to be about them falling in love. Mild spoiler: Gigli, rhymes with really, magically cures Lopez's lesbianism later in the movie in no time flat. At least, there was a better sense of realism regarding a lesbian dating a guy in Chasing Amy thanks to Kevin Smith's smart script. It's utterly offensive in its portrayal of mentally handicapped people as the National Treasure kid is told by Gigli to \"act normal\" even though he can't because of his \"psychological defects\" as his boss, I think, puts it. What's with his obsession with Baywatch, though? Most of the actors outside of Bennifer are one-scene wonders. They do one scene, earn their paycheck and get high. Do you want to watch a nice romantic comedy that has Ben Affleck and LGBT themes? Go watch Chasing Amy. Do you want to watch a movie about crime that involves kidnapping a prosecutor's mentally challenged brother easily? Then I'm sorry, because whichever way you view this movie, you lose either way. Bennifer had better chemistry than Bennifer. Did you get it? Because he began dating that other Jennifer during Daredevil? I'm terrible at these wit games.",

The problem however, the boss thinks that Gigli would screw up, so be brings in another mobster to either support him for the task, or do it for him. I have heard so much about this film being one of the worst films of all time, and when I saw it on DirecTV, I was very curious about it and even though it's not one of the worst films that I've seen, Gigli is still a very awful film that I honestly can't believe that I was watching it. This movie was around the time that Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck were dating, and since the movie has both of them in one film, the studio wanted the film to be a romantic comedy as Martin Brest's intention was to make a dark comedy mob film. Let's get to the positive because there are a few that I can think of. The acting is not bad, Christopher Walken is one of the funniest parts in the film, which he's only in it for a few minutes, and Al Pacino is having a lot of fun in this which I feel like he's in a completely different movie. I like the idea of one of the main characters being a lesbian as you don't see that often in films, especially the mainstream ones, but that's all I can think of sadly. The chemistry between the main characters feel a bit forced that you already know what's going to happen to them two. The writing isn't really good as there are some laughable lines that are not to be taken seriously, and there's a lot of plot lines that don't add up at all. It's not really that funny, nor interesting to watch as there's nothing much going on. The characters are bland, and it's not inspiring to watch. Gigli is a dull film that I'm glad that I got to see it just to see how bad it is, and while isn't there as my worst films, I still didn't like what I was watching.",

She calls it feeding her to wolves, when her mom abandoned her on a NYC subway pushing her to go to casting calls. She admits that Hollywood has burned out her spirit. \n\nShe admits she was raped by James Woods, over and over, in an abusive relationship that soiled her innocence. Jim was older than Missy's father at the time, and chewed Missy and spit her out when Missy couldn't control her mouth. \n\nMissy claims to follow Marianne Williamson, where Maryanne teaches that \"relationships are laboratories for the holy spirit\" but Missy can't hold a relationship since she often switches to a bipolar state of a ranting lunatic. \n\nMissy, tries to lift herself up by talking down to people, and yet she  \n\n\tFailed at being an actress, staring in a movie called Seclusion, which got a 0% Rotten Tomatoes score and has been reviewed as \"simply terrible\" as well as Gigli, which bombed, and received a Rotten Tomatoes Critic Score of 6% and a Flixster User Score of 13% That means 97% of critics hated it, and 87% of real movie goers thought it was absolutely terrible.  \n\tFailed at running a bed and breakfast, \n\tFailed at being a waitress and was fired in her 1st month at the The Outback, as she could not properly \"sling steaks\" to Outback's customers.

Too bad there is no need for her to do a \"mommy dearest\" sequel. \n\nMy friend tried to find her a psychologist to help her work out her anger issues with her mom throwing her to the wolves at age 12 - something she hates her mom for and allows herself to foster rage vs love. \n\nJames Woods dumped her when she cursed him out the day his mom died.

The class was PSY301 Children and Violence. I think the professor saw violent qualities in Missy and could not get through to her.  \n\nLastly, Melissa looks up to acts of suicide as something \"courageous\" and looks up to what Robin Williams did. Terrible. Life is something to be enjoyed, shared with others, and spread the love. She somehow thinks there is some dignity in taking your own life and having your loved ones suffer.\n\nSomeone, please reach out to her and help her as she is spiraling downward.",

I saw it in theaters, I bought it and have watched it a number of times since.  Is it the best movie ever made?  Certainly not, but it is so far from the worst ever made and if you actually look at the box office debut and numbers, far worse bombs invaded the box office before and have since.

Al Pacino and Christopher Walken are crazily wonderful in their cameos.  And while the story isn't ground breaking, I give it credit for originality.  It's not another superhero movie or franchise which Hollywood has been obsessed with churning out for years now.  It's entertaining and funny.  Haters are going to find hate because they're too lazy to form their own opinions.  Bottom line: the film is overly criticized because of their very public relationship but so far away from the bottom of the barrel that people are so keen to place it in.

            "content": "Everyone who had a hand in making this movie should be ashamed. This is not hyperbole. This is fact. This movie is an abomination.\nI could not finish it in one sitting. It's that bad. I don't know where you can start with this.\n\nThe movie opens with Ben Affleck breaking fourth wall. He is monologuing about his life while staring directly into the camera. He is shaking down a business owner. Note: Ben Affleck is the most unbelievable mobster to have ever mobbed. He tries to have some kind of mob accent and have his bouffant hair but it just looks stupid. It would have been more believable if he went MORE over the top.\nHis boss is the second most unbelievable mobster to ever mobbed. There is some sort of plot where the big boss man (Al Pacino...? Yeah, Al Pacino) is being indicted on federal charges, so Ben Affleck has to kidnap the prosecutor's retarded brother. That is the plot. Ben Affleck, whom his boss has ZERO confidence in and says as much before ASSIGNING Affleck this task, has to kidnap a mentally handicapped person. No, I can't even say that, that would be rude to people with actual mental handicaps. This was a retarded person.\n\nSo Ben kidnaps retarded prosecutor's brother (Justin Bartha aka the guy from the Hangover who gets left on the roof for pretty much the whole movie) and hilarity fails to ensue. Ben Affleck is just mean to this kid. But then, Bartha does shit that would make me want to punch him in the face. Okay, he just randomly yells stuff. Okay, there are people who have tourettes and ticks. But then Bartha would say stupid shit like, \"girls make my penis sneeze.\" That was a line in the movie. What am I watching?! This was horribly offensive.\n\nSo Affleck kidnapped Bartha and they are just chilling in his apartment. Suddenly, this turns into some kind of babysitting movie. Then enters Lopez. She is apparently some kind of hired assassin hired by Affleck's boss to make sure Affleck doesn't fuck up the kidnapping. I'm sorry, if you didn't trust this guy, why wouldn't you just have Lopez kidnap the kid. Also, it's never explained what they had hoped to accomplish with kidnapping this retarded kid. Drop the case presumably? But the retarded brother lived in an adult home. His brother obviously didn't give that much of a shit about him. Also, Affleck has him for DAYS and nothing has happened so it was pretty much time to call this plan dead.\n\nBUT NO.\n\nSo Lopez is a verbose assassin. She just pontificates about her sexuality. You see, she's a lesbian. And she must tell Affleck, how much of a lesbian she is. Because that's what lesbians ALWAYS do. Oh vagina this, and scissoring that. Lez Lez Lez. Damn lesbians, cut it out with your hot make out parties and sexy pillow fights. Your lesbian pollen knows no bounds!\n\nFUCK.\n\nSo at this point, Christopher Walken waltzes into Affleck's room, apparently he's a prosecutor too. Affleck voluntarily lets him in. Walken walks around, alludes to the fact that he knows the Bartha is in the room, then has a stroke mid conversation, talks about Marie Callendar pies and how if you put that pie on your head, you'd eat your nose trying to get to it. SOUND TASTY? HUH?! This is legitimately what happened. Then he left. He didn't show up the rest of the movie.\n\nSo Affleck has to keep Bartha occupied for fucking infinity while this plan unfolds. Bartha just wants to see Baywatch, because you know, he only understands boobs or something. Affleck lies to this kid like umpteenth times about taking him to see Baywatch just so Affleck could do random errands. This was like 40 minutes of the movie. Just dragging this kid around.\n\nThen there's one point where Affleck's boss tells Affleck to cut Bartha's thumbs off and send them to the prosecutor. You know, reasonable plan. Affleck's heart suddenly grows three sizes and says he can't do it. And Lopez, that lezbo assassin with the heart of coal, also doesn't want to do it. So they....don't do it. For a long time. No consequences. This kind of just keeps going on.\n\nDuring one of these no point scenes, which was pretty much everyone of them, Lopez starts pontificating about how amazing it is when a chick eats her out. Yup. And Affleck stares at her like she was a rack of ribs and he hadn't eaten since Chasing Amy. She ends her lezbo rant with saying how she would never let a dude eat her out. Then says she's gonna let Affleck eat her out. She punctuates sexy time with spreading her legs and saying, \"It's Turkey Time. Gobble Gobble\"\n\nThat is where I turned off the movie.\n\nSo a couple of months later, I watched the rest. It's more of the same. It's two awful people being awful to an awful actor trying to portray someone with a real handicap and somehow, they are trying to garner sympathy as people put in a precarious position.\n\nThey just fuck around some more until AL PACINO shows up. AL Pacino meets with Affleck's boss, Affleck, and Lopez. Al Pacino looks disheveled but that's just his normal garb. Basically he goes on a rant about how stupid it was to kidnap the prosecutor's retarded brother and how they are idiots. He kills Affleck's boss in a move everyone wanted to happen 10 seconds into the film. Al Pacino was the real hero in the film.\n\nThen Pacino lets them go to...I guess return Bartha? I'm not quite sure. So now it's this sad time, because these two awful characters had grown such a meaningful fucking relationship with their kidnapee. Finally, Affleck takes Bartha to see Baywatch. They are filming on the beach, Affleck drops him off and then GIVES HIS CAR TO LOPEZ. Not like, hey you can borrow it, but YOU CAN HAVE IT, I KNOW YOU MUST LEAVE ME NOW AND I'M OKAY. So Lopez, being the bitch she is, actually takes the car and leaves. Bartha dances .... like a retard with big breasted women. When you see it, you'd agree it was retarded. There is Affleck, looking like a fucking tool, being smug and probably thinking, \"I'm an amazing guy.\"\n\nThen Lopez comes back. She was supposed to drive into the sunset, because her...identity was compromised...or it just wouldn't work out because she's a lez and he's an unattractive lez or something. Who knows anymore. So she comes back around. Affleck, with a straight face, asks if he can get a ride. Yo, dumbass, THAT'S YOUR CAR.\nShe is bitchy about it and then lets him in and they drive into the sunset together. Actual ending of this movie. I omitted a part where Affleck cries at one point because he really wanted to bang Lopez but he couldn't because she wouldn't let him. So we are supposed to root for the guy that cried because he wanted to fuck Lopez and she said no. What a hero.\n\nThis movie fucking sucked. It is inexplicably bad. These are people who should know something about movies. This is worse than any other bad movie. At least Troll 2, it is funny and maybe you can blame some aspects of the film on language difficulty. At least a movie as bad as Troll 2 doesn't have someone offensively portraying a kid with a mental handicap.\n\nNo one should let Affleck live this down. I hope the Joker in the new Batman movie tells Affleck, \"it's turkey time, gobble gobble\" and then just shoots him dead.",

            "content": "Gigli is one of those rare films that always end up on everyone's worst lists. After watching it, I understand why.\n\nLarry Gigli (Ben Affleck), a lowly hit man in Los Angeles, who is looking to finally score big, lands the perfect \"job\"--or so he thinks. He is assigned to kidnap Brian, the psychologically challenged younger brother of a powerful federal prosecutor, in order to save his mobster boss from incarceration. Holed-up in his one-bedroom apartment with his kidnap victim Brian, Gigli starts to realize that what he thought would be a routine assignment has become a daunting and unwieldy task. Ricki (Jennifer Lopez), a beautiful, independent-minded female gangster, is sent to assist Gigli with the kidnapping--as his boss doesn't have faith that Gigli can carry out the job on his own. But when his feelings for the elusive Ricki begin to grow, and he becomes genuinely concerned for the vulnerable Brian (Justin Bartha), tough guy Gigli begins to trade in his tough exterior, for a more human, sensitive one--and considering his profession, that could be quite a dangerous path to follow.\n\nThere is nothing to say about Gigli (although it is). It is not the worst film ever made. However, it is one of the worst. Since the Bennifer accident, everyone has been bashing the film. After watching the film, it is well deserved. Why? Because in this film, Bennifer have no chemistry with each other. When you have a couple in your film, they suppose to have chemistry. But hey, that is just me.\n\nIt is shocking that great talents like Al Pacino and Christopher Walken would sign up to such crap. Are they in this film just for a paycheck or what? Um... I guess so. I mean I don't know to be honest. It is a good thing that everyone's careers (except for Lopez) went somewhat up from here.\n\nI have nothing else to say about Gigli (although it is very little). Gigli is a clumsy trainwreck from beginning to end. There is nothing positive to say about it. It is such a bizarre (not in a good way) mess of a movie that I being to question why it was made, why did I watch it, and why talented actors wanted to sign up to be in it. I would say it must be seen to be believe but it is not worth your time or money (if it is on Blu-Ray or DVD). Even as a bad movie fan, you should avoid Gigli like the plaque.",

A mentally retarded man with a heart of gold. Now come on, I'm all for the Hollywood \"hooker with a heart of gold\" tale, but \"Gigli\" is just ridiculous. These two hours of raw sewage were directed by Martin Brest, who had a Best Director Oscar nomination under his belt before taking on the Herculean task of trying to form a celluloid entertainment centered on Ben & JLo. Poor Martin. Thank Christ that Ben & JLo broke up, which guarantees no \"Gigli\" sequel. Of course the fact that it cost $54 million to make (half in salaries to the gruesome twosome) and had a WORLDWIDE gross of $5.6 million probably greatly reduces the odds of a \"Gigli\" sequel, as well. I would prefer Hollywood give $53.9 million to kids dying of cancer or disabled vets and then spend the other $100,000 on a \"Girls Gone Wild\" film set in San Quentin. Now THAT'S entertainment.",

Gigli tries to be a smart comedy-crime movie, instead it has no comedy nor crime, its just a boring 2 hour movie with nothing interesting in it and goes to new lows on the two genre's. Now, the performers: Ben Affleck is supposed to play this smooth and charming hit-man...instead he plays an absolute d***, who is angry with poor Justin Bartha who has mental problems, screaming and shouting at him, and thinking he's the boss. Affleck is unappealing, uninteresting and just dumb, never thought he was the leader in the movie, but good thing his career changed thanks to his other films and the ones his directing (Gone Baby Gone, The Town, Argo). Justin Bartha plays the mental person in this movie, and even though he sometimes is appealing, he also was annoying and loud, but at least you kinda feel bad for his character who has those problems, so he was a so-so to me. The best performance in the movie (and probably the only thing good in the movie) was Jennifer Lopez, she was cute, charming, appealing, sexy and she looked like the leader in the movie more the Affleck. Still, she has that line in the movie...\"It's turkey time..gobble gobble\"...it leaves you saying \"...what?\", so yeah it was nice to know that the female lead wasn't terrible, she was better than I thought. However, the messy and terrible script can't save Lopez's exceptional acting, making her look worse with Affleck and anybody involved in this movie. Also, Affleck and Lopez have absolutely no chemistry, it looked force and they were at that time \"Bennifer\"...how can there chemistry fail? Makes you wonder why it failed. Then we go too the cameos of Christopher Walken who gave the most bizarre performance ever, everything he was saying didn't make any sense (again, terrible script) and Al Pacino who had no meaning whatsoever to be in the film, he was there to be.....there. In the end Gigli has no thrills, a few empty chuckles, a waste of talented actors, a messy script, lackluster chemistry between its leads, it's 2 hours of boringness and it never decides what it wants to be, worst movie of all time? not really but its the biggest train wreck of a movie I have ever seen.",

Then there's some off-putting blood-letting and poorly delivered lines of dialogue (\"gobble, gobble\" the most infamous example) on top of the confused mess the rest of the film is, and it's not fitting nor funny.

Jennifer Lopez is the main reason to see the film (if that is much of one at all). Her resume is weak to say the least with only two or three credible performances to speak of- \"Gigli\" is surprisingly one of them. Her approach to the film is serious but with just enough of a 'wink, wink, nudge, nudge' carelessness to make it credible. She also handles her monologues quite well, something Ben Affleck crashes and burns with at every chance.  Christopher Walken and Al Pacino also add a few points as well and like Lopez, do well with their dialogue. But in the end, \"Gigli\" is just plain bizarre. It has no idea what it wants to be (a romantic comedy, a mob picture), what it wants to say (about people leading violent lives, about sexual ambiguity, about the politics of crime) or what it wants to make you feel and worst of all, it's just plain boring most of the time.",

This was already explored, really really well, in \"Chasing Amy\", why try to swing for that ball again when you can miss as miserably as this film does?  There are a few moments where the film looks like it has potential, which is why I didn't give it the lowest rating;  Christopher Walkens cameo starts off as a solid piece of acting, until a bit about Marie Calendar sends it over the edge and his entire scene quickly loses its traction.  There are some choice comical moments in the Al Pacino scene and at select moments.  But most of the characters in the film don't seem to have any purpose that stays consistent or doesn't constantly attempt to change whatever identity is being established with the characters.  Still I will give this dumb piece of filmmaking this much credit:  I can see where it seemed like it was going in a direction of quality and then immediately ran away from it.

It's dull bad acted, bad written, very stupid, rediculious in premise, and not funny. The only thing good about this movie is the scene where Christopher Walken asks for pie. I have a theory on this scene though. I think Christopher Walken realized how aweful this movie is so while acting in this scene, he gets side out of focus and starts thinking about a pie he will eat on his lunch break.  That's my theory because that line seems so improvised that it couldn't have been in the script. Hell even the actors look confused after the line is said.  I guess the director was just ok with it.  That being said, this movie is pure awfulness. Just search the pie scene on YouTube it's not worth watching this movie for one scene.",

I intend to shred this film to pieces, because this is without a doubt, the worst comedy I have ever seen. I hate it more than any other shitty comedy I've seen, which includes garbage like Friedberg and Seltzer's parody films. This is a comedy that is about as funny as the thirty minute rape scene in the original I Spit On Your Grave...which was never funny at any point. And it is just as unpleasant and uncomfortable to watch. This $54 million cinematic abortion is nothing but two hours of pure torture to sit through, and I was left wanting to gouge out my eyes and rupture my eardrums because it was excruciating to watch. The acting is horrible and unconvincing, the music is atrocious, the humor is beyond horrible, the dialogue is hideous, the cameos are unnecessary and annoying, and it's horribly boring on top of everything else. This film has left a permanent scar in my memory, and I will forever have lines such as \"It's turkey time. Gobble, gobble,\" and \"the mouth is the twin sister of the vagina\" engraved in my memory. By the time I finished watching this film, I had died a little on the inside. It may have only been a small part of my soul, but that small part died in excruciating agony having to deal with watching this unholy abomination called Gigli (And no, I am not exaggerating. The film literally killed part of me). Don't believe anyone who says that it isn't as bad you've heard, because in reality, it is that bad. In fact, it was worse than I had anticipated! If you value your sanity and enjoy comedies that are actually good, never watch Gigli or it will permanently scar you for life. FUCK GIGLI!!!!",

Jennifer Lopez is the main reason to see the film (if that is much of one at all). Her resume is weak to say the least with only two or three credible performances to speak of- \"Gigli\" is surprisingly one of them. Her approach to the film is serious but with just enough of a 'wink, wink, nudge, nudge' carelessness to make it credible. She also handles her monologues quite well, something Ben Affleck crashes and burns with at every chance.  Christopher Walken and Al Pacino also add a few points as well and like Lopez, do well with their dialogue. But in the end, \"Gigli\" is just plain bizarre. It has no idea what it wants to be (a romantic comedy, a mob picture), what it wants to say (about people leading violent lives, about sexual ambiguity, about the politics of crime) or what it wants to make you feel and worst of all, it's just plain boring most of the time.",

They probably should have toned it down a little. Plus, this movie has no idea what genre it wants to fit into: romantic comedy, crime thriller, \"Rain Man\" ripoff. It's terrible. Plus, the dialogue for Justin Bartha's retard character was ridiculous. Actually, the dialogue for the whole movie's terrible, but his nonsequitirs were among the worst. And, finally, Christopher Walken and Al Pacino both have cameos in this and they are some of the hammiest, most outlandishly over-the-top cameos I've ever seen. Pacino basically screams all of his lines and Walken starts ad-libbing crazy crap that has nothing to do with the film, even working in a strange accent for a line or two. This movie sucks. (Oh, I forgot to mention how at the end of the credits you're \"treated\" to an acapella performance of \"Baby Got Back\" by Justin Bartha's retard character. Wow! Awful!)",

It was for that exact reason that I set out to watch this flop for the first time since it came out, ten long years ago, and it was so much worse than I could have expected. Usually films that are bad, and feature big stars, at least have a gimmick, maybe some off-color jokes, or have a bloated budget, but there's no reason for this unmitigated tripe. There is no budget, the script is atrocious, and the characters are either one sided, conceited, or plain dumb. The premise alone is staggeringly awful: a very low level mobster (Ben Affleck a gangster? Really?) has to kidnap the brother of a federal prosecutor, who happens to be mentally challenged. That alone should stop you if you are reading the script. He does so with minimal effort, which is strange, because you would think there would be a lot of security for someone so vulnerable. Then waltzes in the other lead, Jennifer Lopez, as a hired gun, who happens to be a lesbian. I will say that at least they represent her as someone who deals with the traps and tribulations of relationships and comes out the other side the same as any hetero, when speaking about her relationship with another woman. Still, her sexuality, which is dealt with right off the bat, is pivoted once she starts hanging around Affleck's character. The mentally challenged character is also handled poorly, as he oftentimes rings his hands wildly and asks to go meet girls at the \"Baywatch\" time and again. Justin Bartha is in this role, and it baffles me that it doesn't follow him around the same way the others have suffered for this flop. There are some brief cameos from Christopher Walken and Al Pacino that are twenty times more entertaining, but most of this film concerns this strange love story between the goon and the lesbian. They barely leave the apartment, talk to anyone, or do much of anything (if cutting a dead guy's thumb off doesn't count). Most of that doesn't even matter, because the background score for this film is so loud and obnoxious you can't hear the actor's voices over it, which makes this feel as cheap and sleazy as the rest of the movie. It's so pathetically contrived and icky at all times, and not one person can justify to me why this film needed to be made.",

Martin Brest's film tries to dodge conventions and be 'edgy' material, but it absolutely does not have the brain cells to even function as a movie of its own. We are given no sense of character to these type-A bad screenwriter offsprings, and the 'plot' they swim in is simply non-existent. There is no drive, no conflict, no momentum to Gigli-- just an endless, slackly-edited run of the most horrific hard-boiled dialogue imaginable. Marred by a broadly uncharismatic lead turn by Ben Affleck and a deeply unconvincing Jennifer Lopez posing as a lesbian female gangster, Gigli may not be one of the worst movies of all time, but fuck it-- it is, for my money, one of the worst film viewing experiences of all time.

Needless to say this movie answers those questions with an  exaggerated answer, but its a true answer. On both sides. This movie was suppose to be a comedy right? Cause if not, it came out that way, and there are many types of comedy, the laugh till you can't breath ones (which are beyond rare and few), the really bad attempt ones (like a majority of the ones with the Rock in it), and even ones like this (an almost cartoon quality to real life, for the sake of not using that \"E\" word again) I liked it a lot, but it only makes it on to my favorites for the \"lips\" speech Jennifer gives to Ben.",

Affleck, who has since redeemed himself, is just absolutely horrid in this film and it is beyond me how the director did not see this.  Lopez, as a tough girl, is laughable at best.  The one redeeming feature of this film is the cliche-ridden, yet well played Brian, played by the now-stufly Justin Bartha.  It is a shame his first starring role is of a stereotypical mentally challenged man, but with the role he got, he did make the best of it...leading to great roles in TV's \"Teachers\" and most recently in 2009's sleeper hit, \"The Hangover.\"\r\n\r\nNo matter how curious you may be, take it from me and everyone else who has seen this film and has taste...don't waste your time...and moreso, don't waste any money!",

I started watching this movie with certain prejudice. I figured it might suck so bad that it turns funny. It didn't do that to me. I do have to admit that B Afl sucked big time when he was trying to be a bad ass. Other than that, this was just a movie which you can just as well watch and not suffer bad. There is this dialogue in this movie, which I take tries to imitate that of Tarantino, but it fails in that. Most all imitations are doomed to do that. Yet, I kinda enjoyed it. It brought back memories to me from when I was adolescent and tackled with issues and philosophies the main characters do. And those issues pretty much include sex and being cool. For a non-native English speaker the dialogue was just dandy lesson of how to deliver an issue in an elegant manner. I do doubt, however, that crooks really use language like that which makes it kinda unnatural. It seems to me also that it is unnatural, or at least not so easy, to turn a lesbian (J Lo's character) into straight. Or maybe that way, but not the other way around. Christopher Walken has a small role in the beginning of the movie and, much to my surprise, he is all grey. His eyes, his hair, and his outfit. Al Pacino was also lured to this flick. His role isn't much of a role. But I didn't expect much anything else. He lost his talent after Godfather movies. His talent deflated in a direct proportion to his ego inflating. The retard in the movie, he resembles Christopher Meloni. That's pretty much all I can say about the movie, because I missed the ending. I set my decoder to time it right, but maybe the programs were delayed, and my timer disconnected the recording before the movie ended. I probably missed about 10 minutes of the end. I bet there was a closure. I bet Walken was involved in it. I bet Pacino didn't walk out of the charges he was facing unharmed. I bet the retard reurned to the nursing home intact. And I believe that J Lo turned from a tuna turner to a straight chick, and those two lived happily ever after. Now  missed the ending. And I - this is no joke - would like to have seen it.",

J-Lo's acting in this film is the worst kind of tripe. She phones in her performance so much that the long-distance rates must be outrageous on her part. Al Pacino is equally unbearable as the obnoxious criminal who is setting all this up to avoid prison time.

Martin Brest directed the very good (if not excellent) Scent of a Woman (also with Pacino, in his first Oscar winning role) and his direction here, while mediocre, is not terrible.\r\n\r\nWhat truly drives this film to the dust is the screenplay, which is laughable to the point of deserving ridicule.  Anatomically oriented without being funny, it meandres, going nowhere and doing nothing before mercifully ending after what seems like an eternity.\r\n\r\nThe two principals are also terrible.  Lopez has always been a terrible actress, and Ben Affleck, while a talented writer/director has an ecclectic mix of good to god awful performances under his belt (surviving christmas or pearl harbor anyone), and this is one of the off ones.  Walken shines, and Pacino is good, but they can't save this film from its seeming obsession with making mistake after mistake.\r\n\r\nAvoid like the plague.",

I really couldn't believe that the film had even gotten out of the cannister with acting that flat, which is something, given Ben Affleck's track record, not to mention the addition of such acting muscle as Al Pacino and Christopher Walken into the mix.  Moments that were supposed to be tender fell flat with music that tried to over-dramatize scenes whith which the actors clearly weren't connecting, and the script, full of missed connections and wanderings that made absolutely no sense to the audience, made it an amazingly good example of a film that should have never left the studio vault.

If you ever want to know the character of the person you're dealing with, simply ask their opinion of Gigli. If they've seen it and hate it, then rest easy knowing that you're dealing with a well-adjusted individual. If they've seen it and even remotely like it, then back off. That's a sociopath...\n\nHaving seen my fair share of absolutely terrible movies, it says something when a movie is so abyssmal, so retched, so ungodly awful that it left me numb. I saw \"Pocket Ninjas\". I saw \"Dracula 3000\". I saw \"Ax 'Em\". I even sat through \"Torque\" ALONE, and none of these movies manage to fail on as many levels as Gigli. In spite of the fact that its plot involves mobsters, kidnapping, and appearances from Al Pacino and Christopher Walken, not only is the movie surprisingly boring but it somehow finds a way to be about absolutely NOTHING. If that weren't bad enough (and it is) the performances have all of the appeal of prison rape. Each of the central characters comes across as overwhelmingly unlikeable. They seem to talk at length about any number of subjects, but not to make a point of any kind. Instead they just enjoy hearing themselves talk, and YOU'RE gonna listen. From Affleck's \"bull/cow\" bullshit to Walken's cameo that is ultimately meaningless there isn't a single character whose company wouldn't make you want to drive their face through the nearest wall, and that's including Justin Bartha's character. He seems less like he has a mental handicap, and more like an asshole making fun of people with a mental handicap that just won't let the \"joke\" end. Look no further than his facial expressions when he's not speaking to solidify the case against this movie. You may have noticed that I haven't mentioned Jennifer Lopez...\n\nGigli is the kind of bad movie that you can't even have fun with easily. It's hard work and conditioning, and the reasons are obvious. The movie itself is like ball-cancer. I've never had it, I know, but could it really be much worse than watching this...?",
