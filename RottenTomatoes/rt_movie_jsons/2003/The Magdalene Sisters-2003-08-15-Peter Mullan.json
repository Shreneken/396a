    "summary": "In 1964, three teenage Irish girls are sent to a Magdalene asylum, an archaic home for \"fallen women,\" though their crimes aren't criminal. Rose (Dorothy Duffy) is pregnant out of wedlock, Bernadette (Nora-Jane Noone) has been caught flirting with a boy at school, and Margaret (Anne-Marie Duff) is sentenced for having been raped by a family member. There, the girls perform hard labor supervised by cruel nuns, led by the sneering Sister Bridget (Geraldine McEwan) -- and dream of escape.",

            "content": "Peter Mullan's (2002) film is based primarily upon the TV documentary 'Sex in a Cold Climate' by Steve Humphries which was first aired on RTE (Ireland) and BBC (England) in 1998. The documentary records the recollections of four Irish women who spent their youth and a good proportion of their adult lives as involuntary guests of uncompromising Roman Catholic nuns.\n\nThe film is set in a particular example of this institution which, somewhat akin to the English workhouses of the late 19th and early 20th century, became established in Ireland after the Second World War. The Magdelene Laundries took their name from the biblical figure of Mary Magdalene, a 'fallen woman' whom Christ befriended. \n\nWe join the main heroines of the movie - Margarette (Anne-Marie Duff), Bernadette (Norah-Jane Noone), Rose (Dorothy Duffy) and Crispina (Eileen Walsh) in cameo as their entrance scholarships for the Magdelene Laundry are being sat. \n\nWhat's most uncomfortable about this part of the movie, is trying to work out what's going on. Trying to work out what it is that's being whispered and what will be the upshot of it, and why. At first, it seems like the soundtrack of the film and the contrast have failed. But before long, it becomes obvious that the soundtrack of the film and the contrast have succeeded. The dark and deafening silence surrounding the circumstances under which these young women are being consigned to the unwelcome stewardship of the Magdalene Sisters comes through loud and muted. \n\nWe follow their induction into the laundry by Sister Bridget (Geraldine McEwan), ably assisted by the Sisters Jude (Frances Healy), Clemantine (Eithne McGuinness) and Augusta (Phyllis MacMahon) who contrive with formally celibate gentlemen like Father Fitzroy (Daniel Costello) to represent a world in which God's greatest ideal is achieved through punishment and penitence.\n\nAs the film progresses, we begin to understand why it is no accident that these institutions should have been laundries. They could - after all - have been bakeries, dairies, canneries or places where mailbags are sewn.  \n\nWith every garment that passes through the process, unmentionable filth is cleansed - if the Sisters are to be believed. And if the Sisters are to be believed, the sins of the teenagers and the route to Heaven is bound up in hot water, salt and flagellation.\n\nAnd as we follow these unsaintly girls on their hapless journey, we finally learn that salvation is as straightforward as a letter we are not privileged to read and a brother who arrives with a suitcase - as if there is anything that anybody could possibly want to carry away from a place like this.\n\nThis film is a powerful elegy to the suffering of these unfortunate girls who, constrained to silence for so long, have finally found a voice.",

            "content": "The most infuriating and horrifying movie I've ever seen.  I still in some ways can't believe some of what is depicted in this movie.  It is a polemic made specifically for maximum outrage, an approach to filmmaking I might normally react negatively to, but I can't think of any other approach for this story that is appropriate.  \nthe cruelty and absurdity depicted here was inspired by horrors which were all too real, suffered by apparently tens of thousands of Irish women in the 20th century. I wasn't at all surprised at the villainy of the nuns and priests, I understand how unchecked power works.  What shocked and saddened me was the unbridled hatred of the parents for their own children.  I still don't understand how this was so.  It could entirely be the influence of the church, but in mid 20th century Ireland I'd bet even the devout didn't follow every single letter of church law every second of every day.   There must have been something else in the culture that allowed fathers to so readily hate their daughters.  In Medieval Europe, fear of the nature and power of female sexuality was a prominent feature of society, and was easily connected to fear of the supernatural.  This fear was easily turned to hatred, and is in large part responsible for the witch panics that were ginned up to control the populace.  Fear is the most powerful agent of control, which is why terrorism will forever endure as a tactic.  What is depicted here is a fully alive and powerful  manifestation of the medieval fear-turned-hatred of women's sexuality, apparently little changed in Ireland in the intervening centuries.  The last Magdalene Laundry was closed in 1996.  Not 1896, 1996.\n\nAs a film, some have found a variety of things to criticize, yet it undeniably accomplishes what Peter Mullan set out to do.  The performances are top notch, although hard to watch, especially with the case of the mentally challenged girl.  The final shot of this poor girl left to rot in solitary confinement still angers and haunts me.  This is a powerhouse film but I couldn't really recommend it to anyone.  It is the sort of piece which should be kept around as an eternal cautionary tale, not just in regard to the churches but to all those in positions of power, and to all societies and individuals who may fall into the grip of fear and hatred, even of their own children.",

It's not an easy film to watch, but there is a sense of hope within the film, and that's all our characters can pray on. In Ireland in 1964, four teenage girls, Margaret (Anne-Marie Duff), Bernadette (Nora Jane Noone), Patricia (Dorothy Duffy) and Harriet (Eileen Walsh), all sent from their respective homes to one of the many Magdalene Asylums in Ireland, because of their various flirtations, misdemeanors and \"sins\". The Magdalene Asylum they are at is run by mother superior Sister Bridget (Geraldine McEwan), and she wants to ensure the girls return to God's grace through prayer, hard work and other forms of penance. The girls are humiliated by the nuns, but the girls plan to escape from the asylum, but they'll be punished further if caught. Mullan called this his prison film, and was spurred on to do it when learning the victims in these asylums had not received any compensation or an apology, it's an uncomfortable film but it has some good performances throughout, and Mullan has a good visual eye, and brought this horrible sin to people's attention.",

            "content": "Hey, if making bad films is a sin, then this asylum is designed to redeem the impure is just plain perfect for Hilary Duff. Oh no, wait, I'm sorry, this film stars that chick who married James McAvoy, \"Anne-Marie\" Duff... as well as some girl named Dorothy Duffy, and is about four so-called \"sisters\", so if this film also starred Hilary and Haylie Duff as the other two Duff, then this film would pretty much be more along the lines of \"The Duff Sisters\", and it would be terrible, partially because the effectiveness of the disturbances would be diluted by the delight in seeing Hilary Duff getting degraded. Yeah, I'm sorry, that was messed up, and this asylum was messed up, which is ironic, because it's named after the woman who Jesus saved from violence and degradation at the hands of hypocritical sinners, and all it pretty much does is sinfully brutalize and degrade women. Hey, in all fairness, Jesus didn't have to pull that, \"Let he who is without sin cast the first stone\" stuff on the Irish, who most definately do not mess around, especially when religion is brought into the mix. For you non-Irish folk out there, if you think that disciplinary Catholic establishments and the Irish are hardcore individually, just imagine them combined, then you might have a better idea of why this film was shot in Scotland, rather than Ireland. You might think that this film's Scottish makers didn't want to spend money to go to Ireland and knew that Scottish is close enough to Irish, but really, I'm betting that even the Scots were afraid to enter an Irish Roman Catholic establishment, much less shoot in one. Hey, I don't really care where in the world this film was shot, because, regardless of the value of story concept, we probably could have done without it, which isn't to say that this film is actually bad, because on top of being too bland to be bad, this film has a few additional saving graces.\r\n\r\nThis kind of, as the Rotten Tomatoes consensus put it, \"women-in-prision film\" has been done time and again, yet the subject matter remains quite strong, being rich with dramatic possibilities that this film all too often fails miserably at executing adequately, yet still stand firm enough in concept to create some moderate degree of immediate intrigue. Overambition and oh so many other mishaps in Peter Mullan's directorial execution betray and often dilute this intrigue, not enough to where the film loses so much juice that it sputters out at contempt, but certainly to where the film generally fails to bite as firmly as it should, and yet, with that said, as improvable as Mullan's efforts are, it's hard to deny the ambition and how such ambition can spark inspiriation. The film's effective occasions are ever so rare, and even when they do arrive, they still need a bit of additional juicing up, yet they can be found and, for an all too brief moment, truly spark this film to life and give you a fairly fine taste at what this film could have been: a tense, emotionally resonant and altogether provocatively effective meditation on the dark depths of humanity and the misguided religious. As a whole, this film fails to that, which is what it first set out to be, and I hate that, as this subject matter deserves better, yet it's not like effective occasions don't stand here and there, going intensified by a strength that stands consistent, no matter how much this film falls flat: outstanding acting. Films built around this much intense dramatic meditativeness are indeed directorial challenges, and ones that too many directors, such as Mullan, fail to overcome, yet as an acting challenge, films of this type have a better track record of being well-done, and sure enough, if nothing else can be said about this film, it is an awesome acting piece, with the antagonists' performers proving effectively convincing as cruelly misguided religious abusers, and the leads ranging from remarkable to truly sensational, whether it be the gracefully human Anne-Marie Duff as the audience avatar, or the subtly atmospheric Nora Jane Noone as the flawed headstrong, or the emotionally powerful, heavily layered and overall show-stealing Eileen Walsh as the unstable yet somewhat hopeful sufferer. The film's strengths are just so startlingly limited, yet what strengths there are are considerably potent and could have made the final product a truly rewarding one. As they stand, the strengths save the film and, at the same time, remind of the areas in which the film does anything but accel, for although the film is graced with its share of high spots and simply being too bland to be bad, a promising project's potential worthiness goes much more often than undercut by the final product's being, well, to be frank, just so blasted boring!\r\n\r\nNow, this film isn't necessarily one of those abstract, do-nothing art pieces that the critics love to celebrate, even though the actual success rate of those films are so startlingly slim it's all but unreal, so don't go in expecting something like the somehow even more tediously boring, monotonous and do-nothing prison suffering film, \"Hunger\" (Don't worry too much, you pretentious jerks, I still didn't hate it; you'd be surprised how far my \"Too Bland to Be Bad\" rule goes), but, jumpin' James McAvoy (A little something for Anne-Marie Duff, that little cougar), it is exceedingly slow, not just in structure, but in atmospheric pacing, with most every one of this film's 119 moving near-glacially, largely because hardly anything goes on during the 119 minutes in question. Again, we're not talking about \"Hunger\" in all of its \"watching an abridgement of an expendable officer character's entire workday [b][u]for no reason at all[/u][/b]\" non-glory, yet the film is riddled with long periods of nothingness, broken up by events that are rarely all that engaging in the first place. Needless to say, this film's formula of meandering through nothingness until we reach a typically underwhelming actual happening gets to be, not repetitious, but all-out monotonous quite quickly, and that, combined with other missteps that lead back to slowness, does serious damage to the film, which possibly would have stood a slight chance of being saved as decent if it didn't make all of the dullness that undercuts what could have made this film an engrossing one all the worse through, to put it simply, lifelessness. Again, it's not like the film is thoroughly cold, as director Peter Mullan's ambition is all but impossible to ignore, largely because it way too often sinks into overambition, and partially because there are, in fact, a few occasions in which Mullan delivers on reasonable effectiveness, or at least about as much as he can, yet on the whole, Mullan takes on the aforementioned challenge of working with an atmosphere driven by intense meditativeness and fails miserably, robbing much of the atmosphere of meditative subtlety and leaving many of the film's themes and conflicts, which seriously need to be effectively handled, to often come off as overbearing and fall-flat. The film's atmosphere is in desperate need of subtlety, something that Mullan is all too often unable too deliver on, yet such a misfire with conflict handling is merely a branch from the key flaw within the film's atmosphere and, by extension, the film itself: no juice in atmosphere. Mullan has his breakthroughs with the help of his excessive ambition, yet on the whole, whether it's attempting to establish conflict or attempting to establish the slightest bit of emotional resonance, the atmosphere turns cold, dry and dead, and because of this, the film is generally, not simply not as effective as it really does need to be, but boring as all get-out. This film is thoroughly dull, and therein rests what may very well be the key saving grace for this film: blandness so intense that the film is secured from collapse into contempt, yet make no mistake, with all of its reasonably bright occasions, this film blandly - nay - boringly betrays its ambitions and ultimately falls flat as an unrewarding bore of squandered opportunity.\r\n\r\nOverall, the film's subject matter is worthy, and ever so occasionally brought to life by reasonably effective moments through all of the ambitious pushing for bite within Peter Mullan's direction, as well as consistently complimented by performances that range from commendable to phenomenal, thus the film finds itself graced with strengths that aid in its going saved from overall badness, yet can't save the film as decent, going undercut by a monotonously do-little formula and a primarily cold atmosphere that drains life, resonance and even subtlety until \"The Magdalene Sisters\" ultimately falls flat an overambitious and incredibly mediocre misfire.\r\n\r\n2/5 - Mediocre",

I mean, it's pretty bad, what happened to them, if you're a minor and still legally not responsible for yourself.  If your parents make the decision to turn you over to the convent and let you be made into a slave labourer.  That's bad.  However, these women were adults, most of them.  They weren't allowed to say, \"Okay, I'm leaving now.\"  They weren't allowed to make the decision for themselves even after they were legally adults.  The idea that a grown woman has to run away to get out of something that is not a punishment for a crime?  Not a mental institution?  That's wrong.  No one knows exactly why most of the individual women ended up in the infamous Magdalene Laundries, but it is known that many were there because they were pretty or because they were raped.  Others were mentally handicapped and were sent to the laundries because it was somewhere to send them.\r\n\r\nOnly one of the four main characters here is really a Bad Girl.  Crispina (Eileen Walsh) did, it's true, give birth outside wedlock, but she's not all there.  Probably enough so that she wouldn't legally be allowed to give consent, if she were in the modern US.  On the other hand, Rose (Dorothy Duffy) knew what she was doing and did it anyway.  She is taken out of her hospital bed, her baby given away even though she changed her mind before he was out of her sight.  Margaret (Ann-Marie Duff) was raped at a wedding.  Bernadette (Nora-Jane Noone) was merely pretty and flirtatious, and she was an orphan with no one to take interest in her.  The four women end up in one of Ireland's Magdalene Laundries, where they will live and work until they die.  They are under the total control of Sister Bridget (Geraldine McEwan), who follows the order's strict instructions that the women will live a completely ascetic life.  Even friendships are discouraged.  They are encouraged to report one another's misdeeds to the nuns so that the women will be punished, in theory for the good of their souls.\r\n\r\nA brief look at the history of the movement which gave birth, as it were, to the Magdalene Laundries shows that they actually weren't originally bad ideas.  They were places prostitutes could go in order to find employment which didn't involve sex.  (All based on the old lie about Mary Magdalene, of course.)  After all, it's still hard to find another kind of work if that's what you've done before.  In those days, women could choose to come or go, and apparently, many of them did so on a regular basis.  However, the reactions of women who spent time in the Magdalene Laundries in the mid-twentieth century have generally been that the film downplays the real horrors.  At bare minimum, these women were working for literally no pay, doing backbreaking work in silence.  They were required to call any nun \"mother,\" no matter the relative ages of the two women.  And again, there was no choice in the matter, no deciding to come or go anymore.  And essentially none of them were prostitutes anymore, so even if the version of the Magdalene had been accurate at first, it wasn't by the point this story began.\r\n\r\nThe film balances the anger of Bernadette, who knows she hasn't done anything wrong, with the quiet resignation of Katy (Britta Smith).  Katy is an old woman.  She has been in the convent for decades, and she has long since accepted that she will die there.  Of course, Katy also had a baby herself, long ago.  Whether it's piety or brainwashing, Katy has come to accept that she deserved to spend her life atoning for going off with that soldier so long ago.  Perhaps that Bernadette didn't do anything is what drives her anger, but one rather suspects she would stand firm by her independence no matter what.  She is afraid, I think, that she will someday end up like Katy--no fear, I think.  But neither Margaret nor Rose have Bernadette's strength, and it is entirely possible that they would fade.  After all, the women knew that the nuns had the power of God, and it is a sign of Crispina's madness, so far as the nuns are concerned, that she can question the Godliness of the priest.\r\n\r\nBut Crispina wasn't Crispina's real name.  She was really Harriet.  Rose was told that they already had a Rose, and she would go by her confirmation name of Patricia.  It is a show of independence that she takes back her name.  These women take beatings, take having their hair cut and their names taken away.  Crispina breaks, but there was less of her to start with.  Society demands a penance for those who go against its rules.  In this time and place, penance could take the form of entry into the Magdalene Asylums.  The film shows the lives of four of the women who walked those halls and performed that labour.  It's impossible to show the full scope of the abuses, but one is worth noting.  It was considered that all of these women had already fallen--even Bernadette, who had never known the touch of man, and Margaret, who was raped.  And since they were already fallen, there was no harm to them if you took advantage of that yourself, and of course it would be because they had lured you.  A system like the Magdalene Asylum has the potential for abuses built in, and the film manages to show that without exploiting the history of the thousands of women who were \"penitents.\"",

            "content": "A very disturbing and shocking movie of the \"Magdalene Laundries\" in Ireland, where teenage girls were sent to (sometimes voluntarily, sometimes not) of rather arbitrary reasons and grounds. \r\nThese type of asylums for young girls that were run by nuns actually existed in Ireland for several hundred of years, until the last one was closed in 1996. \r\n\r\nIn this motion picture, we follow a couple girls in 1964, who have been sent to this \"Magdalene Laundries\" to live for an unknown period of time. \r\nBernadette (Nora-Jane Noone) were sent to this institution for being considered too flirtatious with the boys. Some of the other girls, like Crispina (Eileen Walsh) were sent for having given birth to a child while being unmarried. \r\n\r\nI get the impression that the director, Peter Mulligan, gives a realistic view of what happened on the institution. But of course this doesn't represent all the Magdalene Asylums. \r\nThe girls are neither portrayed as angelic victims, or slutty skanks, only normal teenagers like you see everyday. \r\n\"Bernadette\" for example is a very strong willed girl, not entirely sympathetic, but able to do whatever it takes to escape from the institution. No matter if she'll have to sell her body, or kill for it. She refuses to let anyone else to have the control over her. \r\n\"Crispina\" is her opposite, with very weak nerves and no self-respect at all. She wishes nothing more than being reunited with her little kid, and is willing to humiliate herself and do whatever the nuns ask her for, to reach that goal.\r\nThe teens are at the Magdalene Asylum officially to become pious, clean living women. The supervisors idea of accomplishing that is severe discipline (read=daily punishing, slavery work, humiliation, imprisonment).\r\n\r\nOne character which one could call rather extreme is Mother Superior; sister Bridget (Geraldine McEwan). For you who have watched the Miss Marple-series will probably be surprised seeing the sweet little Jane Marple-actress playing such a demon as \"Sister Bridget\" so convincingly. \r\n\r\nThis is, to sum it up, a very interesting and well made movie, that gives a very strong impact, with great acting performances to a great direction. I do not hesitate to recommend it.",

            "content": "Writer/Director Peter Mullan follows up his surreal and blackly humourous Scottish family drama \"Orphans\" with this hard-hitting account of the agonising and torturous true-story of the abuse of young women from Ireland in the name of religion.\n In 1960's, young women where incarcerated in a Irish convent, run by the Catholic church, for committing such 'misdeeds' as flirting with boys, becoming pregnant out of wedlock, and being raped. They are physically and psychologically abused by the head nun and her sadistic staff, who are convinced they are doing the Lord's work.\n Having based his screenplay on actual Magdalene inmates' experiences, Mullan achieves an authenticity of what life was like for the young women that had to endure the injustices, humiliation and brutality of these asylums. At times it's very difficult to stomach, such is the sheer power and uncompromising telling of this harrowing story and it's full of overwhelmingly excellent performances. Geraldine McEwan as Sister Bridget, the head nun, gives one of the most absolute personifications of evil ever commited to the screen and Eileen Walsh is heart-breakingly compelling as the naive, downtrodden and religiously devoted Crispina. Her performance was worthy of so much more recognition than she recieved. Speaking of which, the entire cast and crew deserved more awards attention on it's release. Had this been directed by someone with a higher profile than Mullan and his crew, this film would have been hailed as a masterpiece. As it is, it's had to rely on word-of-mouth to find an audience but this doesn't lessen the effect or superb work by everyone involved here. Mullan's direction is flawless, the cinematography by Nigel Willoughby is stark, and almost de-saturated, adding to the overall feeling of desperation and loneliness of the women and as mentioned, the performances are perfectly pitched from a largely unknown cast. It may be hard for some to accept this behaviour went on but it's even harder to accept that these asylums lasted until 1996, when the last one was finally shut down.      \n A harrowing and emotionally charged drama that while based on fact, is highly subversive. If the Vatican condemns a film on it's release (which it did with this) then there's no doubt that you're in for a hard-hitting film.\nPainful, provocative and important!",

            "content": "The movie is not subtle, it's not ambiguous. As Peter Bradshaw noted, it's extremely \"incendiary.\" The filmmaker approaches it from an angle, as he knows inevitably will the audience, that nothing could justify the punitive conditions the women were forced to live in. There is no moral defense for an individual or a society who condone punishment akin to a concentration camp for women whose only \"sin\" is that they are sexual beings. A modern audience will not accept one, the filmmaker does not offer any. It is not so much in the scenes of actual physical abuse that Peter Mullan portrays the bleakness of the institution -- it is in the humiliation, helplessness and total despair of the women. One of the pivotal characters is that of Crispina, a simple-minded girl who emotionally succumbs to torture and intimidation, even though she is unable to intellectually comprehend them. \nIt is very easy to look at it in a movie and think \"why didn't the women just leave?\" The movie does a good job of showing the isolation each inmate had to live in and how the nuns discouraged the development of bonds between the women. This was clearly no \"sisterhood\" and this lack of solidarity explains why a handful of nuns could control that many women in the asylum. Two of the women did eventually leave in the movie, unlikely as it may have been in actuality (although, it did have a hilarious scene; gotta hand it to Peter Mullan for inserting some humor various points in the script that didn't trivialize the subject at all). However, the ending with the \"life after\" notes isn't exactly optimistic. We have been shown by Mullan that the outside society is far from welcoming and itself putrefying in the sexism and religious dogma that sent these women inside in the first place. The women, sadly, buy into the system as much as those outside. It's not exactly surprising that the Irish branch of the Magdalene asylums were still functional all the way until 1996.",

So apparently if any woman was to flirt, get raped or have a bastard child, like the three main characters did, they were classified as fallen which means that basically they are going down the side of the demon or Satan.

O filme mostra como funcionavam os Conventos Madalena, onde garotas acusadas de serem tentadoras ou por qualquer outro pecado eram mandadas para trabalhar como escravas. O importante é frisar que o filme se baseia em histórias reais e que isso faz parte de nossa história recente, já que o último destes conventos fechou em 1996.\r\n\r\nEm Nome de Deus tem o defeito de começar de maneira arrebatadora e jamais se igualar ao nível depois. De início, vemos as famílias se desfazendo das filhas de maneira chocante e fria. Ali estava o pior de toda a história, e é uma pena que isso não seja mais explorado na obra. Aliás, Mullan peca pelo exagero do significado em algumas cenas, como fazer a freira pregar um sermão enquanto conta notas de dinheiro. A mensagem é acertada, mas fica óbvia demais, incomoda.\r\n\r\nPorém, o diretor mostra sutileza brilhante nas torturas pelas quais as garotas são submetidas. Só a cena em que a freira faz uma competição com todas as garotas nuas é melhor e eficaz que todo o Saló de Pasolini. O filme é corajoso por não romantizar nada e deixar a sensação de mal-estar nos acompanhar até os créditos. Daí, vem sua importância.",

It's an ensemble piece, but no one stands out. I have no idea how this found its way into my queue. But for other people I'm sure its a good movie and its filmed pretty well.
