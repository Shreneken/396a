    "summary": "Marlin (Albert Brooks), a clown fish, is overly cautious with his son, Nemo (Alexander Gould), who has a foreshortened fin. When Nemo swims too close to the surface to prove himself, he is caught by a diver, and horrified Marlin must set out to find him. A blue reef fish named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) -- who has a really short memory -- joins Marlin and complicates the encounters with sharks, jellyfish, and a host of ocean dangers. Meanwhile, Nemo plots his escape from a dentist's fish tank.",

            "content": "Finding Nemo is an absolute classic in the world of animation, and for good reason. This film tells an incredibly heartwarming and emotional story that is sure to touch the hearts of viewers of all ages. From the beautiful animation to the amazing voice acting, Finding Nemo truly has it all.\n\nThe plot of Finding Nemo follows the journey of a clownfish named Marlin, who sets out to find his son Nemo after he is taken from the ocean and placed in a fish tank in a dentist's office. Along the way, Marlin meets a host of colorful and memorable characters, including the forgetful Dory, who helps him navigate the dangers of the ocean.\n\nThe animation in Finding Nemo is truly breathtaking. The underwater scenes are stunningly beautiful, and the characters are so well animated that they feel like real, living creatures. The attention to detail in the animation is simply astounding, and it's clear that a lot of love and care went into creating this film.\n\nThe voice acting in Finding Nemo is also top-notch. Albert Brooks is absolutely perfect as Marlin, bringing a perfect mix of humor and heart to the role. Ellen DeGeneres is equally fantastic as Dory, and her performance is one of the highlights of the film.\n\nOne of the things that really sets Finding Nemo apart, though, is its ability to appeal to both children and adults. While kids will love the colorful characters and the exciting adventure, adults will appreciate the film's deeper themes of family, loss, and the importance of letting go.\n\nOverall, Finding Nemo is a true masterpiece of animation that is sure to stand the test of time. With its stunning visuals, memorable characters, and emotional story, it's a film that everyone should see at least once.",

My only criticism is that although there are some very funny moments, like Doreen speaking whale(Ellen DeGeneres was born to speak whale, really she was) and Barry Humphries's shark, I don't think it is as laugh-out loud funny as Toy Story. Finding Nemo is definitely the most beautiful visually of the Pixar movies, I would certainly pick it over Cars. The music by Thomas Newman was just beautiful, and I always look out for this in a movie, and it was a delight hearing \"Beyond the Sea\" over the end credits. The characters are genuinely memorable, especially Doreen and Bruce. And who can forget the girl Darla, with the Psycho music?(that is really terrifying)The voice talents are very good indeed, especially Ellen DeGeneres, and I liked Willem Dafoe's Gil. Albert Brooks made a wonderfully paranoid father figure, and I loved the plot about Marlin's son Nemo being taken by divers and Marlin (a clown fish) racing to find him. That is simple, but we meet characters like the turtle, so the film is filled with fun, enough to satisfy the fussiest child. In conclusion, 9/10 for the visuals and the characters. Outstanding!

As Marlin goes on his journey and develops his character, the characters he meets are all memorable and iconic. The aquarium crew are all memorable as well. The animation is top notch and really captures the underwater environment in a believable way. Ellen DeGeneres stands out in the voice acting department, by creating a unique and memorable character in Dory. One of the best films Pixar has done, highly recommended!",

Other than that it was also because I came from a very conservative family. I was not allowed to watch movies in theatre, especially not a Hollywood one. So as all the kids used to talk about it I grew into hating it. And when this movie came on TV I only watched it with a critical point of view. It was only years after when I watched it and truly appreciated it.\nFinding Nemo is a very colourful movie filled with many sea creatures. It is an excellent movie that can teach children about the different types of marine life. I have heard about how everyone started hunting for clownfish after this movie came up. Although this is a bit sad and very cruel thing to do it also shows the impact that this movie was able to create and how much people enjoyed watching it. The fishes were shown in a very cute manner, especially the pufferfish.\nThe only problem I have with this movie is the lack of a story. It's just a fish going from point A to point B. Although this does make for a good story since it helps in character development and world building, but these things should not be done while completely sacrificing a good story. I think I really like this movie and I will watch that once again to truly appreciate it.",

But I feel like this movie has something stronger than those two movies combine: comedy. This might be the funniest movie that Pixar has ever made, it's definitely the one I quote the most by a good bit. Dory alone is good for at least 7 quality jokes. So yeah, I love it, just not as much as the two movies before. Go on Disney+ and see if you agree with me on this deep sea adventure!",

            "content": "Pixar is known for its brilliant storytelling and the compelling themes their films portray. For example, Pixar's masterpiece \"The Incredibles\" is about embracing and accepting who you are. In the film \"Ratatouille\" its premise is around the phrase \"everyone can cook\", suggesting that you can do anything you put your mind to. And of course \"Inside Out\" shows audiences that its ok to feel sad. These are just some examples of Pixar's amazing storytelling and they all somehow catch the attention of people everywhere. This is because their themes are still very human. Pixar can make people relate to a rat, an 11 year old girl, and of course, a family that WANTS to be normal. Now, how can Pixar make us sympathize for fish? Well that is exactly what Pixar does with Finding Nemo. The film starts very dark with a rather large fish attacking and killing most of Marlin's children and his significant other. But after these events he sees that one has survived, and he will do anything to protect his one kid. From the first scene with Marlin and Nemo, you can already tell he is constantly worried. Nemo wakes up ready for school, but Marlin doesn't seem thrilled. He watches every move and tells him that the ocean is extremely dangerous. But once something terrible happens Marlin's goal is to find his son and bring him to safety. If Finding Nemo was just about a father trying to find his son, would it really be entertaining? No, it wouldn't, and that's where Dory (voiced by Ellen Degeneres) comes in. Dory is pretty much the complete opposite of Marlin. She is careless and goes by her motto of \"Just keep swimming\", which is an effective and subtle way to show perseverance. Marlin spends a good chunk of the film getting into predicaments and freaking out. But whenever Dory faces these challenges she adapts to the situation and finds good out of it. Its through Dory that Marlin learns to not live life in fear. Perhaps one of the most important scenes is in another troubling situation, where Marlin learns and we see his character grow. He claims that he would never let anything happen to Nemo, with Dory responding, saying \"Thats a funny thing to promise, well you can't never let anything happen to him, then nothing would ever happen to him\". This suggests that Nemo will never learn anything if he constantly lives in fear. Now on the other side of this story we have Nemo, A defective fish that of course, finds his Dad over protective. Nemo finds his way to a fish tank when he plays a perilous game of \"who can touch the butt?\". Nemo, although not as interesting of a character, finds ways to persevere. Essentially, Finding Nemo is about not letting fear control you because you simply can't live that way.",

Andrew Stanton had some great help with the brilliant, creative & witty script by Bob Peterson & David Reynolds, that withheld so much passion and creativity.\n\nThe cinematography and animation blew me away!

It simultaneously teaches parents that you can trust in your children and friends, while remaining a protective parent, but do not go overboard. Andrew Stanton's story about a father fish searching for his last living child is sympathetic, exciting, heartfelt, and funny. Finding Nemo should continue to entertain children and enthralling their parents alike for decades to come.\n\nIt's a wonderful story with Stanton's hilarious and poignant writing making the vivid computer animation all the more alive. The Australian backdrop and plethora of fish make Finding Nemo that much more fun. The water physics are particularly impressive in Finding Nemo. I adore Thomas Newman's score with his long held notes of symphonic bliss and tension. He captures the mood perfectly for Finding Nemo. Pixar's animation has made leaps and bounds since Toy Story and Finding Nemo is the ideal culmination of everything they had learned up to that point.\n\nAndrew Stanton's direction is energetic and engaging with far wide shots of the ocean everywhere and intimate close-ups that make the audience empathize with this father fish's struggle and sympathize with aquatic creatures' lives in general. David Ian Salter's brisk editing keeps the plot progressing, while allowing the audience enough time to get to know all these aquatic new friends in Finding Nemo for 100 minutes of nautical amusement.\n\nJeremy Lasky and Susan Calahan's cinematography is stunning as wide shots like Marlin and Dory looking at the whale from afar swim closer or the angler fish's light slowly appearing to reveal its vicious fangs. Finding Nemo finds all kinds of neat perspectives and angles to demonstrate the small size and small of Marlin compared to the oceania life all around him.\n\nAlbert Brooks is magnificent as the killjoy clownfish Marlin, who has endured only tragedy in his life. His dry sarcastic pessimism is super fun to watch as Marlin. Now infamous Ellen DeGeneres is pretty spectacular as the short term memory loss inflicted blue fish named Dory. Finding Nemo is honestly the only thing she's ever done that's entertaining. Alexander Gould is entertaining as the innocent fish Nemo.\n\nWillem Dafoe is very cool as the planning tank fish Gill. Geoffrey Rush is excellent as the Australian pelican Nigel. Brad Garrett is boisterous as Bloat, while Alison Janney sounds very funny as the pink starfish Peach. Stephen Root is hilarious as the manic Bubbles. Austin Pendleton is funny as the OCD inflicted fish Gurgle. Vicki Lewis is so likable as the bubbly Deb and Flo. Joe Ranft puts on a fabulous French accent as the shrimp Jacques. I adore Andrew Stanton's Australian surfer bro vibe as the adult sea turtle called Crush. Elizabeth Perkins is a nice voice for Nemo's mother Coral. Bob Peterson's friendly mantaray Mr. Ray is as fun as John Ratzenberger's school of moonfish. You have to love Barry Humphries' shark Bruce with his booming deep voice. Eric Bana and Bruce Spence are also funny as the other two sharks: Anchor and Chum. In all, Finding Nemo's voice cast is awesome and well cast.\n\nIn conclusion, Finding Nemo is a wonderful family film that really holds up.",

I can't imagine the film without thinking back to her character who propels the story along in her own way and a feeling of disgust accompanies these remembrances. Sure there is a story of a father's love and devotion to his son at the center of the film but I struggle to appreciate that when DeGeneres stands front and center in my mind. Children who like her work, god forbid, might take a lot away from the film but for me she was a cinderblock that killed any positive feeling that I may have had for the picture as a whole and it's themes.",

Alexander Gould, Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres are the obvious stars as the early mentioned trio. There's a load of others though, with Willem Dafoe (Gill), Geoffrey Rush (Nigel) and Barry Humphries (Bruce) all giving excellent performances.\n\nThe animation is superb, a few moments haven't aged as greatly but the absolute vast majority still looks unbelievable.

The film stars Albert Brooks as Marlin and Ellen DeGeneres as Dory.\n\nThe voice acting is to the point with only a couple scenes where it feels a bit off. Willem Dafoe also makes a appearance as Gill a fish that Nemo meets in a fish tank. I found that he gave a firm but likeable performance.\n\nThe characters are written and portrayed very well from Nemo to Marlin. The occasional character would annoy me a little bit, but luckily the main cast is strong and memorable.\n\nGood cinematography with some very nice shots of the ocean especially. \n\nThe animation like most Pixar films is exemplary. The animation is vibrant and moves incredibly well.\n\nI√¢(TM)ve always liked the ocean as a setting for a film and this one doesn√¢(TM)t disappoint. The ocean is a colourful but also empty place and the perfect setting for this story.\n\nThe film also has a very good style from the colour scheme to the way the characters act.\n\nThe film also has a very steady sound design especially with the noises of the sea. What I mean is when the characters swim the sound design really helps with the effect. \n\nThe dialogue was steady with a couple of memorable lines.\n\nThe music is sound and fits very nicely within the film. I also really like the song Beyond the Sea.\n\nThe story follows Marlin a fish who is looking for his son who has just been taken from him by a human. The film  follows him and his son and how come to terms with there flaws. For example Marlin is to overprotective with his son.\n \nThe film does also have a fare shear of comedy that works for the most part. Now and again there will be a joke in which I will find unfunny but for the most part the jokes are strong.\n\nThe film at points has a very good and strong atmosphere especially with the scenes where the ocean seems huge.\n\nThe film is also quiet emotional especially the beginning.\n\nThe film is also very enjoyable but I would say that I enjoy it less then a few of the other Pixar films.\n\nThe film does have a few things wrong as well but most of them are just nit picks.\n\nOver all I give it a 8/10 - worth paying for two tickets",

Another thing about this movie that I love is my new catch phrase: √Ø¬ø 1/2fish are friends not food√Ø¬ø 1/2√Ç?. This is a motto I try to live my life by. To do this I wake up everyday and think about the true philosophical meaning behind such a phrase. This usually gives me a headache from the mass amount of thinking I need to use to get the most out of this phrase. This one got a 10/10 on the Right scale and was a perfect sequel to spongebob.",

            "content": "I'm doing my movie  review on Finding nemo. Finding Nemo takes place in water. You can pretty much tell what the movie is about just from the titel. \nFinding Nemo is about a young fish named Nemo. Nemo is starting his first day of school when he gets caught by a man in a scuba suit. Marlin (Nemos dad) goes looking for him and meets a fish named Dory who has short term memory loss. \nMarlin and Dory go on a  long adventure looking for nemo. Nemo's (point of view) nemo ends up in a fish tank at a dentist office. This one little girl ( Darla) goes in for a dentist appointment and she gets a fish nemo is going to be that fish ( Darla kills fish really easily) so nemo and the other fish in the tank are trying to come up with a plan so nemo doesn't get killed by Darla.\n\tI liked this movie because its super fun and kind of thrilling. It's a lot of fun seeing the adventure they go on looking for nemo, and it's interesting to watch nemo's little adventure in the fish tank and how that all works out.  But it definitely is more fun than boring. \nKids of all ages would enjoy it, i think most adults would enjoy it as well. Overall this movie is great you could watch it with your family,friends,or all alone its funny and intriguing overall would recommend.",

            "content": "The movie finding nemo was successful because, it was a fun show for kids and that it showed the challenges about friendship and family. For example one of the things I am going to talk about in this essay is, how marlin tries to protect his son from the dangers in the ocean. And through this essay I will also be talking about the struggles and good times you have with friendships and family.\nIn the show finding nemo Marlin tries to protect his son from all of the dangers in the ocean. Nemo then responds with some childish remark about how he thinks it is safe. Nemo was with some friends and they dared each other to go touch a boat \"they called it a butte\" when it was nemo's turn his dad saw him and told him not to do it but he did it anyway. We now think that nemo is a rebel. He then is snatched by some divers and taken away. Marlin chases after the boat but it is to fast and it got away. That's when he ran into a blue fish named dory who helps him along the way to find his son. Marlin and dory become friends along the way. Marlin and dory had some crazy adventures like get chased by a scary fish, bouncing on jellyfish, made friends with turtles, and got chased by some sharks that say \"fish are friends not food.\" They then find nemo and bring him home and at the end of the movie he starts his first day of school. But through nemo and marlins adventures they both eventually learn what parents and kids really need from each other. It gives you good insight to how parents and children react to each other. A lot of the time they don't see eye to eye. Parents want to keep their children safe and the kids don't always agree. The kids want to get out there and explore life and the unknown. \nThis movie stresses the importance of maintaining balance in your family life and the way you introduce your kids to the world. Sometimes we are too overprotective and this limits our chance to grow as a family and spend quality time as a family. For example marlin was trying to keep nemo safe by not letting him do anything dangerous. But nemo is just a curious kid and looking for some adventure. When nemo got taken by the divers marlin was like heck no i'm gonna get my kid back because he loves nemo so much. Since he loves him so much he chased the boat to try and save him thats when marlin met dory. I think that's what all parents should do try and help or try and protect their kid. Even if there kid doesn't listen, lighten the rains a little bit so they can learn some stuff. For example how nemo went across the whole ocean and was super scared but that didn't stop him from learning and trying to get back to his dad. Family is everything. \nMarlin only succeeds in finding his son nemo with the help of dory. \"Because the power of friendship allows everyone to achieve their goals.\" While marlin and dory are searching for nemo, nemo is taken to a dentist office and is put into a tank with some other fish that are from the ocean. The fish worn nemo that there is a crazy little girl coming to take him. All the fish and nemo prepare to start an escape plan. They all work together to help each other escape from the girl. The plan was to make the tank really dirty so that the owner will have to clean it. And the owner will have to put the fish in little bags. But the plan almost failed when the little girl arrived to take nemo. She shook the bag nemo was in and nemo went belly up so they thought he was dead so he got flushed down the toilet, but he wasn't dead. Right when he was in the toilet marlin and dory flew threw the window in a pelican's mouth. Marlin and dory were to late, because nemo had just been flushed. The good thing was that the toilet pipes lead to the ocean. Marlin and dory were taken back the the ocean by the bird and marlin was really sad, he almost gave up to finding nemo. He was so sad that he told dory to leave so they went their separate ways. But the way dory went she had found nemo. Dory was like are you nemo and he was like ya and she was like \"aaaaa I know your dad\" and nemo said \"you do\" so they went and found marlin. Then nemo and marlin were reunited and they were so happy to see each other. They then all became a happy family.\nFinding nemo was a successful movie, that showed the challenges of family and friends.  Marlin, nemo's dad tried to protect him from the dangers of the ocean. Nemo was then taken by divers and marlin went on an adventure to find him. And on his adventure he made a new friend named dory.  This movie stresses the importance of maintaining balance in your family life and the way you introduce your kids to the world. The power of friendship allows everyone to achieve their goals.",

            "content": "Finding Nemo\nA classical or perhaps, the classical feel good Disney film, Finding Nemo follows Marlin the clownfish and his search for his son who ends up across the ocean.\n\nDirected by Lee Unkrich (you may not have heard of him, but he is one of the biggest and most respected names in the world of animation) and starring some more familiar names (Ellen DeGeneres stands out in my mind) it's great fun with appeal for all ages. It lives up to our expectations of Disney-Pixar films, and the lovable, forgetful (but certainly not forgettable) blue tang named Dory is sure to become a favourite of many kids.\n\nUnless you're soulless, you will probably feel some sort of emotion while watching this, and there are many; sadness, happiness, laughter and even tension. It's great fun, with aptly buoyant and bubbly (excuse the double pun) voice acting from DeGeneres in particular.\n\nUnlike most animation and distribution companies, Disney rarely (nor debatably ever) makes mistakes with its movies, and this is no exception; in fact, it by far exceeds the already high expectations we all have for Disney films, adults and kids alike.\n\nThe mix of humour, for both adults and kids, is great, the animation is smooth and engrossing and the script, storyline and acting round off the picture. And the happy ending is the icing on the cake.\n\nHowever, what really sets the movie apart is the emotional depth this movie displays in dealing with family issues and separation. It will tug on your heartstrings and will ring a bell with many viewers.\n\nNot only is it worth your time and money, but it's worth your attention too. The Disney magic flows with eminently likeable characters and importantly eye popping colours in the animation itself. I particularly liked the tonal blues and reflections - working with water as an animator is much tougher than you might expect, and the expert group working on this does it just right. It's laced with jokes and rightly deserves a place in the Disney hall of fame.\n\nWhen Disney gets it right - and usually it does, quite well - it's great. On this occasion it raises the bar above even that. It's a no brainer to watch. \n\nAnimations are notorious for often doing the bare minimum - after all, virtually all animations use the same format, one of the favourites talking animals such as in this film. The difference is the lack of magic. A good animation makes you connect with the characters; an excellent one makes you feel their plight.\n\nAlmost unanimously acclaimed, you can't miss it. It's witty, bouncy, and joyful, all rounded off in Pixar's trademark style with an excellent and aware script to boot, and doesn't outstay it's welcome at a modest 100 minutes.\n\nA must see for all ages. Even over a decade later.\n4/4 \n\nVisit ozayrica.wixsite.com/moviereviews for more",

DeGeneres and co understood their characters and ensured they were wholesome and had substance. Finding Nemo has the thrills and spills to entertain kids and the sharp satire to keep adults hooked. The dreamlike visuals are so immersive. The moral message isn't quite as prevalent as other Pixar films, but it's incredibly captivating & charming to watch.",

The characters are well-matched; differences to allow for comedic and conflicting moments, yet enough similarities to give them a shared purpose and motivation.\n\nThe other half of the story takes place in a fish tank, where Nemo learns determination and resourcefulness from his tank buddies. From the helpful pelican to the grizzled veteran Gill, he plays off these characters well, and by the end of the movie, had become a much different person...er...fish.\n\nThe characters make this movie, plain and simple.

            "content": "Finding Nemo (2003) - Is not only my favorite Pixar Movie but it's My favorite movie of all time. It  It's a timeless gem in the world of animation and everyone has to have seen this movie at least once in their life. I remember seeing it for the first time in the theaters when I was 6 and it was the first movie to make me officially fall in love with Pixar. \nThe Concept balances between two plots. The first plot is about Marlin and Dory navigating the ocean while coming across colorful characters as well as grave dangers in order to find Nemo. The other plot is about Nemo getting help from a group of fish to escape a fish tank to get back home as well as avoiding being given away to Darla. Both plots work great together and every scene is paced perfectly with enough time to show and establish everything you see on screen. They also take full advantage of the idea of a movie taking place in the ocean with adding many elements that are unique to the underwater world.   \nThe Characters are one too many to count but they are all Memorable and each have a moment to shine when the time is right. Nemo is adventurous and full of heart. I like how they give him an arc of learning to be dependent and not rely so much on others for help. Marlin will surely be  relatable to a lot of parents because of how he has to learn to let go of his son. Dory is loveable, funny and really good for challenging Marlin's character sometimes. Gill is possibly the most complex character in the movie just for how he almost seems like a leader but is actually flawed and sometimes puts himself before others. There are many other memorable characters that are also loveable like Bruce and Mr Ray but it would take too long to explain all of them.\nThe Animation is beautiful and really colorful. This movie came out in 2003 and it's still surprising how much the animation still holds up. The colors really play a big part in the visuals to show emotion or how lovely or dangerous an environment is. Speaking of which, every environment our characters visit is created with the greatest attention to detail and given a lot of personality. Everything in the ocean from the Great Barrier Reef to the East Australian current is just outstanding to look at and even the Fish tank has lot of personality as well. I also love how a majority of the movie is set in Sydney Australia and how they included many details that are usually found in that area. \nThe Music was this time done by a different composer named Thomas Newman and his score is probably some of the most memorable and amazing music i've ever heard from a Pixar movie.\nEvery bit of music captures the emotion of every scene and a lot of it is so catchy that I bet a lot of it is still stuck in my head. The Music can range from soft and somewhat bouncy to loud and dramatic depending on the scene.\nThis movie has left a huge impact on my life and it just keeps getting better and better with every viewing. It's one of the few movie that I can claim is perfect and that's all thanks to it's adventurous story that is fun and action packed, Extremely Lovable characters, Great animation and a memorable music score. It's been one of my favorite movies since childhood and even today it's still all that and a lot more. (A+)",

In my opinion The Incredibles is their finest piece.  I also like Wall-e or the Toy Story film more.  However, this is still a very fun and well-made film I liked it as a kid and still as an adult.  That's the highest praise a family film can receive.\nThe story revolves around a clown fish named Marlin who is an overprotective dad because of events that occurred at the beginning of the film.  One day his son Nemo gets kidnapped by some human dives and Marlin must travel the ocean to find him with his companion Dory.  The story is basic but that sometimes is the best especially for a family picture.\nThe animation is superbly done.  All the characters are fun and likeable and play off each other great.  The jokes are also well-written.  Not all of the jokes land but most are on-point.  I remember when I saw this as a kid for the first time I was laughing like a hyena.\nWhat's great about this film other than everything I just mentioned is that there's not real villain.  There are definitely some antagonists and obstacles for our main characters to overcome, but no real villain.  It helps make the story a bit more real, or at least as real as a premise like this can get.\nOverall, Finding Nemo is a great time for the entire family.  Most have already seen it, but if there's anyone who hasn't then go check it out.",

Willem Dafoe's voice as Gill is great, and the character is underused. The story is fine, but it's pretty unoriginal. There are also some laughs. I definitely think that kids will love it, and it's good for families. But for me, I don't think it's a 99, and I don't think it quite holds up to the expectations. It's also definitely not my favorite Pixar movie, or even animated movie. The ending is also pretty good, and I really like seeing all the characters from the movie together!

Albert Brooks gives a very personal performance; probably the best in his career. Alexander Gould is incredibly surprising and is probably one of the best child actors out there. Willem Dafoe's character is very mysterious and that totally helps when it comes to his development and his story. But the memorable performance is without a doubt Ellen DeGeneres and her incredibly lovable character of Dory. She is incredible and the fact that she is the main character in the sequel is probably the best that could possibly happen when it comes to trying to keep up with the original.

Andrew Stanton takes us head first into the beautiful, strangely bewildering, world of the big blue ocean with Finding Nemo. We expected children to be captivated by this new installment of childrens animation, but parents are also catching the wave as well.\nThis isn't just some fish tale! Okay, well maybe it is. Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks) is a paranoid, highly overprotective clownfish. His son Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould) is a young child full of energy, enthusiasm, with a dash a rebellion thrown in there. Nemo was left crippled at birth after an attack that took his mother and all of his siblings. This leaves NEmo with a deep desire to be independent. This is shown while on a school fieldtrip. Nemo, trying to show off to some friends swims out into open waters. A pair of divers come from the darkness and kidnap Nemo. \n Marlin, with the help a newly found and hilariously forgetful friend Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) start the adventure to save the only thing that he has left in this world. Little did they know Marlin and Dory will run into all sorts of roadblocks along the way. They encounter sharks that have sworn off eating fish, a horrifying Angler Fish, a bale of sea turtles, and a forest of jellyfish. All of this just to track down his son. That's what I call being a good dad! \nFinding Nemo is the perfect mixture of a great story, witty comedy, and enticing animation. The bright colors of the underwater world are extravagant. The dialogue keeps viewers entertained and laughing. While the depth of the story of a father losing his son hooks them in for good. This tale is fit for all, young and old. \nWhen a child sits down to watch this movie, they can relate to Nemo. A young child looking to do his own thing and go on some adventures. Nemo grows along the course of the film. He goes from being a rebellious little punk, to someone who understands the importance of family and how much his father loves him. As Nemo grows, any child who watches him grows as well. This is one of many reasons why this is a fantastic movie for children. \nAs Pixar will continue to reel in fantastic stories every year, Finding Nemo will go down as one of their greatest hits. Children and parents are flocking to this new spectacle. This thrilling tale will warm the hearts of fathers everywhere who care for their children. Although Marlin could be a little extreme at times, it was very clear that he would do anything for his Son. I believe I echo the words of everyone saying that we want more from Pixar.",

            "content": "Finding Nemo is about a fish named Marlin who loses the love of his life right after they name their eggs. There is only one left and since she wanted the name \"Nemo\" he makes the last eggs name Nemo. When Nemo is old enough he convinces his dad to let him go to school and they go to the drop off on the first day. Merlin freaks out because the drop off is dangerous  and follows them. He goes to take him back but Nemo rebels and goes into the drop off and he is taken. Then his dad travels the ocean to find his son and meets Dory along the way.\n\nFinding nemo has a lot of color and that is  one of the rare things about the movie. The movie takes place almost entirely in the ocean. The use of color, form, and movement makes the movie better. \n\nThis movie entertains adults and kids. The kids are amused by the action of the movie yet it also entertains adults with the humor. The adventures and obstacles keep you wondering what will happen next.I personally really enjoy watching this movie and i have watched it one to many times.\n\n\nThe sound doesn't plummet and then get super loud all the time. The sound changes when necessary. This movies sound effects are very creative. For example the part when they fish with the light on the end of it is really loud but the sound effects match it perfectly to make it intense. \n\nDory makes the film come alive and entertaining. Also Nemo has some of the same type of friendship as \"Toy  Story\" but is also different because there is a dumb one and a uptight one. They have never done one with a real life human disability. The fish are also human like which also makes it unique.\n\nFinding nemo is a lot like Pixar animation style. The comedy and wackiness of \"Toy Story' or \"Monsters Inc' or \"a Bugs life\".it has a lot of humor for example when dory first met Merlin and was trying to help him find which way the boat went and touchiness that actually works and a plot that brings tears to your eyes from time to time.\n\nIn conclusion Nemo is unique and unlike any other Pixar animation film.This is a film in which never gets old despite how many times you watch it.This movie is my favorite movie and makes fish come alive.",

I mean, who doesn't hold a place in their heart for this classic?",

            "content": "As far as I can remember, FINDING NEMO was the first movie I ever saw in theaters. I was four years old when it came out and I distinctly remember seeing it for the first time. The movie had quickly become a cultural phenomenon with critics and audiences praising it like mad. Me and everyone I knew loved this movie. I remember I used to recite the lines with friends all the time. I would point out every time I see a fish associated with a particular character.\n\nSo as you may have guessed, FINDING NEMO had a big impact on my childhood. The more times I watch it, the more I appreciate it. The movie has some of the most memorable and entertaining characters of all time, it's premise is very relatable, the comedy is ingenious, the drama is enthralling, the adventure is a lot of fun, and the animation looks absolutely BEAUTIFUL. That's probably the best aspect of the film, the underwater effects look astonishingly realistic! It really makes you feel how huge and mysterious the underwater really is with our main characters coming across all sorts of different obstacles: sharks, schools of fish, jellyfish, sea turtles, a whale, etc. And what really makes it all come together is Thomas Newman's amazing score, which may be my favorite Pixar soundtrack. The themes and the instrumentation really makes it sound like you're in the ocean.\n\nBut it's not just the animation and the music that makes the film so great, all the characters are wonderful as well, and fairly identifiable. Marlin is very over-protective with his son, which many parents can relate to that. And Nemo, naturally, gets irritated with his father's attitude quite often, like a lot of kids do. But it's completely understandable why Marlin is overly protective with Nemo. Just watch that heart-breaking opening, he lost his wife and almost all of his offspring, and was lucky enough for him to be left with just one. Of course he's going to do anything to protect his only child. But it leads to a great message mostly towards adults actually (particularly parents) that you shouldn't always be overly protective and anxious about your child's safety, and that your child may know better than you might think.\n\nBut for me, Ellen DeGeneres as Dory steals the entire show. Her character was so well written and Ellen's performance was so entertaining that it made her one of the most memorable animated characters... ever! And it's not made just for laughs with her fun gimmick of having short-term memory loss, it also makes her a very compelling character. She tells us that this trait she has runs in her family, but can't exactly remember, and it makes us want to know more about her. It also gives the character an arc as she ventures along with Marlin. Since Dory has been on a journey with Marlin for so long and begins to remember things better, she believes she can remember better if she's with him. And it makes that scene where Marlin leaves Dory much more powerful.\n\nThe tone of the film is perfectly balanced, containing many dark and scary moments mixed with a lot of funny and heart-warming moments. It gets pretty suspenseful in scenes with the sharks, the anglerfish, the jellyfish, and the whale, which some kids may find quite horrifying when they first see it. I know I did, I was almost traumatized! But it makes all the happy moments much more endearing with the sea turtles, the school of fish, the tank gang, and the gimmick with Dory's forgetfulness.\n\nIt's really hard to find any negatives with the film. The only thing I can think of is that maybe the film's message can get a little too preachy. We know what the lesson is going to be right from the beginning, and it gets kind of tedious as they keep hammering it in. But really, a lot of Pixar films are like that. Other than that, the film's virtually flawless. The story is wonderful, the characters are wonderful, the comedy really works, the drama really works, the animation is beautiful, the music is beautiful... What else do I need to say? This movie is awesome! Let's just hope the sequel is good.\n\nGrade: A+",

So many of these movies, like Toy Story, Up, and Monsters Inc, could have easily gotten the five star rating from me. And in the middle of that heyday, there was this gem.\n\nThe movie centers around a clownfish named Marlin, who is an overprotective father to his son Nemo. His world is changed when Nemo is taken from the ocean and placed in an fishtank in a dentist office in Sydney, Austrailia. Marlin has to team up with another fish named Dory, played by Ellen Degeneres, to get over there find a way to retrieve him.\n\nOne of the many things I have to say about this movie is that it is beautifully animated. This film takes place in a gorgeous underwater habitat. Everything is colorful, and beautifully rendered.\n\nBut this movie is far from style over substance. It is a great example of Pixar being able to entertain children and adults alike. It balances witty comedy with moments of emotional depth. The characters feel real, and the audience is always interested in what happens next. The adventures that the fish encounter on their journey are exciting, funny, and look great.\n\nThis is a movie that is worthy of the Pixar name.\n\nJaythemovieguy.blogspot.com",

The film already captures our attention in the first act with some tragic events. But the great thing is, we're sucked in despite the absence of the movie's great characters. This is back when Pixar, much to our good fortune, used to rely on its plethora of fun characters. While nowadays they're just seeming to become less musical Disney films. But Finding Nemo is when Pixar first started making its influence of Shrek known. The jokes become more abundant--both subtle and forthright. The comedy took greater risks and involved more self-parody and a little more potty humor. Before Shrek, animated movies were all trying to mimic what Toy Story did--provide us with a very classy story and warm comedy. And nowadays those films strive to find a happy balance between Toy Story and Shrek. \n\nBut Finding Nemo doesn't shy away from warmth either. The oceanic cinematography makes you feel like you're in the ocean as well. You even develop a good sense of direction of where everything is. \n\nThe characters are about as deep as you can go in an animated movie--with the exception, maybe, being Toy Story. \n\nThere's not really anything that doesn't work. This is an amazing family film that both parents and kids will enjoy. Another Pixar classic.\n\nTwizard Rating: 100",

It reads like a tense, Missing-style thriller, but this is Pixar: the characters are all animated talking fish, and in lieu of pulse-pounding drama, it serves up the adorable antics of ocean critters. Without a single discernible antagonist in sight, Finding Nemo piqued Pixar's ability to craft iconic characters (Dory) and create films that please literally everyone. Which is not to say that Nemo lacks action or adventure, as there are numerous edge-of-your-seat set pieces.

            "content": "Considered one of the greatest animated films of all time, Finding Nemo was an unmissable film for me.\n\nDisney Pixar returns to doing what they do best in Finding Nemo: breathing life into figures usually not considered in the real world. This time, they tackle marine life and use a broad variety of sea creatures to do so. Making use of more breakthrough animation, Finding Nemo really scores its Academy Award by revealing an exceptionally detailed universe. All the characters and the scenery under the sea is depicted beautifully with exceptional detail and electric colour, giving the film an exceptional sense of realism while maintaining colourful animated charm at the same time. The animation in Finding Nemo is beautiful because it gives exceptional detail to the design of the characters and has them move so smoothly while the universe around them unfolds. Finding Nemo is full of great characters who are animated exceptionally and are full of a wonderful universe, and the three dimensional detail is breakthrough in quality and is full of unforgettable characters.\nAs with all Disney Pixar films, there is an underlying message in Finding Nemo. This time around, it talks about the treatment of sea life by the human world and how we take fish away from their homes so that we can possess them. It doesn't go as dark as talking about how we eat them, but it does make use of human characters stealing sea creatures and putting them on display in fish tanks for their own amusement. Finding Nemo challenges its viewers to reconsider the treatment of sea life, and it does so through pushing out a compelling story full of characters whom the viewer can really not help but feel sympathy for. Finding Nemo has a lot of firm dramatic concepts in its story while it maintains a script which is consistently hilarious and touching at the same time. The screenplay in Finding Nemo is terrific because it gives the film a plot which is touching and makes valid social commentary, giving it the necessary depth to succeed, but it also fuels the adventure in the film with a lot of childish fun and energy which remains consistently funny from when the film begins its comic material until the film comes to a close. It is able to change atmosphere between being comedic, dramatic and even thrilling without any problem whatsoever thanks to direction from Andrew Stanton. There is a strong balance found, and while Finding Nemo leans more towards being a family friendly comedy, its premise is actually rather dark and it respects viewers enough not to tone down the material. There are moments in Finding Nemo that are really sad and some that are somewhat frightening, but in no time the film is able to return to being a funny adventure again. The tone in Finding Nemo is just excellent, and the concepts and character development in the film make it more meaningful than the average animated film. Finding Nemo is far from your average animated feature, because its depth and animation make it transcend countless other films in the genre, and while at times it feels like the film is a little more serious than it should be for a kids film, the charm is all there and the fact that the film handles its material with such sophistication and maturity that it is very admirable. The script is helped by the voice work of the great cast lined up as well.\nAlbert Brooks does a fine job leading Finding Nemo in the role of Marlin. Thanks to his iconic hearty voice, he is easily able to deliver a lot of dramatic material. And considering that he takes on the role of an overbearing clownfish faced with the turmoil of losing his wife and son, he fits the profile properly. Albert Brooks thoroughly delivers every word in the script very well, and he is consistently energetic in the part as well which means that he is able to keep up with the moving pace and atmosphere of the film. Albert Brooks makes a great contribution to Finding Nemo in the role of Marlin.\nEllen DeGeneres is perfect in Finding Nemo. Dory is one of the greatest characters the film has to offer due to her being the primary source of comic relief, and thanks to Ellen DeGeneres' work in the role it comes off as successful constantly from start to finish. Ellen DeGeneres delivers every line in the role at twice the rate the other actors do, and at the same time as shooting every word out of her mouth she makes it clear that she perfectly understands every word and is forcing nothing. She is dead on every time with  naturally charismatic charm which makes her a hilarious presence\nAlexander Gould fits the profile of Nemo greatly because he has the young juvenile charm necessary for the part. He says every word in a quick and likeable demeanour with a strong level of childish charm to it, and his instinctively energetic nature is one of his most charming elements because he is able to make Nemo an easily sympathetic character. Alexander Gould's well-articulated line delivery and high pitched voice are certainly a strong asset for the character in Finding Nemo, so his role as part of the voice cast is necessary to the film's success.\nWillem Dafoe is terrific because of the darkness he brings to the role of Gill, Brad Garrett and Stephen Root both make funny appearances in their small roles and as always, John Ratzenberger is the icing on the cake in the part of the school of moonfish because every time he appears in a Disney Pixar film it is a humorous romp and so Finding Nemo is not mutually exclusive.\n\nSo thanks to an insightful and important story which is assisted by a great script, some extremely talented voice actors and absolutely unforgettable animation, Finding Nemo is a touching and funny animated film which serves as another successful film from Disney Pixar.",

In the process, BOTH grow up tremendously and bridge the huge gap they have between them at the beginning of the film.  Dory is an exceptional companion in adventure and adds much levity and the perfect moments, and other side characters like Crush and the fish tank fish round the movie out very well.  The story comes full circle in the end, and all loose ends are tied up.  Ranks as my #3 animated film - right next to The Croods.\n\nGrade = 9/10",

The writting, the music, the talent all come together perfectly. Fun fact but Bruce is the name of the shark in Jaws and as such is the name of the white pointer in this film.

That is anyone can enjoy it, and feel something from little children to the elderly. When I watched it for the first time, I was just 9 years old. I did not know about many things then. Now I know many things, and I can understand many complex things.\n\nThe first time I watched it, I just felt the beauty of the sea, and adorableness of the fish, I especially felt this from the main character, Nemo. I also preferred this happy ending. I just felt only one or two things, but from watching I became interested in fish. Now I am 19 years old I can feel many things, and I can think about more things from this movie than when I was 9 years old. In this movie you can empathize with the main character. All of the characters express their feelings like human beings, and their faces are different from others, even though they are same species. They exist as individuals, so you can enjoy this movie as if you watched a human drama. The scene of the ocean is absolutely beautiful, and you can also see the fearlessness of the sea. As one of the typical examples, the drop off is brought up. This place is also one of the symbols of the obstacles in the movie. You can see how the main character overcomes his trials, and you will come to cheer him on.\n\nAlthough Nemo takes a defiant attitude toward his concerned father, he tries to be helped by someone when he has difficulties in some scenes. Although Nemo is defiant, he is also dependent on his father, although he does not notice it. His father; Marlin also depends on his son because of their terrible accident. However through Marlin's adventure, he feels the strength of children and learns how to spend time with children. In the end of movie, they accept each other. At this point, you can know your parent's feelings or feel the strength of your children.\n\nThis movie is not just for entertaining, but it also gives us the opportunity to think of what a family is. It is worth watching, because it tells us what you cannot express correctly. This movie will give you some lasting impression in your mind.",

            "content": "Film reviewers have to walk a very difficult tightrope when describing films that they love. People who value our opinions, for whatever reasons, expect a level of passion and detailed knowledge to convince them how and when to spend their hard-earned money, and we work hard to provide such knowledge and passion on a regular basis. But often a critic will revert to childhood nostalgia or some other form of sentiment to unconvincingly gloss over flaws which to anyone else are in plain sight.\n\nI find myself in this position with regard to Finding Nemo, a film I saw twice in cinemas during its long theatrical run and which I have always held in high regard. Having not seen it for several years, and caught up with most of PIXAR's back catalogue outside of it, I had trepidations about revisiting it, in case my love for it turned out to be rooted purely in nostalgia. Fortunately, my fears have all been laid to rest by the simple fact that Finding Nemo is a truly great film.\n\nFor starters, the film is a fantastic technical accomplishment. Animation's ability to put anything on screen is often bizarrely used to belittle its achievements: we assume that just because almost everything can be done, that therefore it's very easy to do anything. But there is nothing easy or lazy about Finding Nemo's aesthetics: they are the product of years of hard work and research, by highly talented craftsman whose craft and affection show through.\n\nJohn Lasseter, PIXAR's head honcho and the executive producer, has always been a fan of hands-on research. Once the project had been green-lit, he demanded that everyone working on the film got certified at scuba diving, and organised numerous diving trips to allow his animators to study fish up close in their natural environment. As well as getting a mechanical feel for this (i.e. how things move differently in water compared to in air), much of their findings ended up in the films' characters. Clown fish are naturally shy creatures who rarely come out of the anemones, adding believability to Albert Brooks' portrayal of Marlin.\n\nThe visuals of Finding Nemo are beautiful on every level. Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich bring us a world of rich colour and many textured shades, all the while convincing us that we are underwater. They pay particular attention to the way that light reflects and refracts as it moves from the surface through the denser water, adjusting the colour palette ever so subtly whenever we move into deeper territories. Certain mechanics are altered, to enable characters to cry or bleed in ways we would recognise, but overall this is both believable and realistic.\n\nIn addition to its spectacular visuals, Finding Nemo is a brilliant example of how to handle multiple story-lines on screen. Like Toy Story 2 before it, there is not a single edit which is out of place, and not a single section that runs on too long. The transitions between one group of characters and another group are beautifully judged; it's never left so long that it feels like we are neglecting a character, or so short that it feels desperate.\n\nThis in turn lifts the story of Finding Nemo from something seemingly simple to feeling more complex and layered. It is at its most basic level a road movie, with two characters on a long journey from A to B, encountering many strange creatures and events along the way, some of which are helpful, some potentially harmful. In weaker hands the film would either feel overly long and dull or could become very episodic, with the set-pieces not building to a resonant climax. But this is PIXAR, and they know a thing or two about raising the stakes.\n\nThe film has many memorable moments, each of which feel like an escalation from the previous one. The first time we meet Bruce the shark, it's a big deal, but after the underwater mines blow up and the angler fish arrives, he seems a walk in the park by comparison. The same goes for the jellyfish, the whale and finally the fishing boat which Marlin and Dory run into, with the mask and its message tying everything together very nicely.\n\nRunning through Finding Nemo is the theme of letting go, specifically parents letting go of their children and allow them to have their own adventures. Marlin is overprotective of his son Nemo because of the loss of his wife and other babies in the opening scene - an attitude consolidated by his son's birth defect (the \"lucky fin\"). By being stifled for so long, Nemo is compelled to disobey after his very first taste of the outside world, and quickly discovers how frightening it can be. As the father journeys to find his son, both discover that there are times when letting go and trusting others is the only way to go.\n\nThere is a comparison in this regard with Gravity, which has just garnered 11 BAFTA nominations and a further 10 for the Oscars. Regardless of its eventual performance at either ceremony, Finding Nemo (itself an Oscar winner) does a much better job at conveying this underlying theme. While their stories may seem equally straightforward on paper, the storytelling here is better, the characters are more rounded, and there is less of an overwhelming sense of effects cornering the market for innovation. As great as the visuals here are, they do not distract from the story as those in Gravity often did.\n\nEqually, while Gravity's protagonists were overly conventional, the characters in Finding Nemo are as rounded and compelling as we have come to expect from PIXAR. Marlin's conservative nature is rooted in good intentions, and he has qualities that we would recognise in parents we know and admire. While Dreamworks might play Dory's short-term memory loss purely for laughs, here it both lightens the mood and deepens her character. Dory has a pathos to her which comes to a head when she and Marlin part ways, making her scatterbrained moments all the more endearing.\n\nIn addition to its parental themes, Finding Nemo also has a subtext about overcoming disability. Both Nemo and Gill have fins which are damaged or underdeveloped in some way, and both are initially defined by them; Nemo's dad smothers him because of it, while Gill wears his as a battle scar and thereby seems all the more determined to escape. Both characters eventually overcome their limitations in the physical act of escaping, but Nemo goes one further in refusing to let it prevent him live life to the full. As soon as he gets home, he goes straight back out to explore the open ocean.\n\nFinding Nemo is also brilliant at balancing its tone. There are a lot of dark and scary moments, such as the obstacles listed before, and the film is occasionally a little too blatant in reinforcing the horror tone, with obvious references to The Shining in Bruce's attack and Psycho in the scenes with Darla. But elsewhere the film is a barrel of laughs, whether it's Crush's spaced-out surfer ramblings, Dory's forgetfulness or the various exploits of the Tank Gang. It's a very funny film for all the family which balances light and dark superbly.\n\nThe voice acting on Finding Nemo is great, as we've come to expect. Albert Brooks is great as Marlin, using his quivering voice to bring the characters' anxieties to the foreground. Ellen DeGeneres is inspired as Dory, talking as quickly and as boisterously as she does on her talk show but still managing to pull things back during the sadder moments. Barry Humphries is very well-cast as Bruce, pulling off his introduction with great aplomb, and Alexander Gould does a good job with the title character. Even Willem Dafoe, who can sometimes drift into pantomime, is very convincing as the raspy, determined Gill.\n\nFinding Nemo is a truly great film which sits alongside Monsters, Inc. as one of the high points of PIXAR's output. While it doesn't have quite the emotional depth or narrative complexity of the Toy Story films, it is very hard to  find any other fault with it. It's a beautifully-made, beautifully-acted, beautifully-written film which will continue to enchant audiences for decades to come. One only hopes that the upcoming sequel came live up to the same standards.",

It earns that label not because it is funny as all Hell (it is), not because the story is touching, perfectly paced and emotionally involving (it is), not even because the characters are three dimensional, engaging and relatable (they are). \nIt is their best work because this film is one of the only ones ever made that could never have worked in any other medium. A colour CGI film that can only possibly work in that format is a rare thing indeed. I submit that The Incredibles could have been told just as effectively as a 2D animation, Toy Story could have been claymation, and even Up could conceivably have worked in live action. That's not to downgrade the considerable achievements of these remarkable films, merely to suggest that they are not quite of the same formal perfection as Finding Nemo. It resides alongside Raging Bull, Fantasia, 2001: A Space Odyssey and Sunrise as an example of a film which could not work in any other medium. Compare the gorgeous underwater visuals of this film to The Little Mermaid. Great as that film is, there's no comparison.\nFinding Nemo makes us laugh, makes us cry and touches our hearts. Its script is a thing of beauty. Its visuals are beyond compare. It is a masterpiece and I am proud to call it one of the best films of the 2000s.",

            "content": "Finding Nemo is one of the greatest underdog stories ever told, and also, one of the best animated films ever made. Everything about this story is ironic and contradictory, Marlin lives in an anemone and is used to dangerous stings, however, he is frightened by everything and is very cautious, yet he goes on a determined search for his son, Nemo. As for Nemo, he has been sheltered his whole life, and you would think that nothing bad would ever happen to him, yet he gets captured and forced to live in a tank. And then there's Dory, who has short-term memory loss, and can't remember anything for more than a couple of minutes, but she is the one who guides them on her and Marlin's journey. So pretty much everything about this story is unexpected, which always makes for a fun and interesting film. However, there is a lot more to love about this film than just its fabulously written screenplay. For one, the environment that Pixar created for this film is absolutely breathtaking, it is remarkably convincing, and is always perfect for the story and its wonderful characters. It is definitely one of Pixar's most visually striking films, but it is also one of their most well written and charming pictures. Finding Nemo is a film you can watch over and over again and still love, because the characters and visuals are so relatable and perfectly rendered. It is definitely among other Pixar greats like Wall-E, Up, and Toy Story 3, if you've never seen it,or have doubts about its ability to charm you, then you need to experience Finding Nemo right now.",
