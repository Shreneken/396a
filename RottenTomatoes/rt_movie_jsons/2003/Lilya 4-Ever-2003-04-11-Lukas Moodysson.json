            "content": "I'm going to call this an experimental film. Not for any innovations in form or genre, not for some exquisite, complicated purpose, but for its relentless stubbornness to never, under any circumstance, show any signs of light through the darkness.\n\nWe have all seen movies rejoicing and thriving in getting us lower and lower into an abyss of misery and suffering, we have all seen proudly depressing movies, but I, personally, have never seen a movie refusing time and again to let go of the darkness. And this is not a good thing. Lilya 4-ever is, at the end of the day, gratuitously dark. It pretty much made its point thirty minutes into the script, but then it just kept overselling it, just for the sake of showing us that it's gritty and balsy. \n\nGood job, Lukas Moodysson, you are edgy as hell and you did manage to be so in a story that's more than coherent, if a little too exaggerated for a film with cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 aspirations. The soundtrack is overdone, the dream sequences a little too... on the nose and the acting isn't even that good except for lead Oksana Akinshina. On top of that, I really don't like a movie that makes me want to cry in the shower every twenty minutes without giving me a little hope at the end. I'm sorry, but ultimately experimental does not equate to good.",

However it is about desperately hard circumstances in the former Soviet Union and human trafficking. The story is bleak and unrelenting; offering just more tragedy in an interesting and well shot picture. However I don't feel I have taken anything away from this film than a sad impression.",

        {
            "content": "A bleak retelling of a tragic real-life story, Lilya 4-Ever manages to cover very dark and disturbing subject matter without being exploitative or unnecessarily graphic. The camera doesn't linger on the violence or abuse and the filmmakers don't revel in the misery of our lead character. The film is more concerned with the person the horrible events happened to, and not the events themselves. Its only about 30 minutes from the end of the film when the crux of the story actually comes to the fore. The rest of the time is spent with our heroine, who is abandoned by her family and neglected by those around her. Oksana Akinshina makes an excellent lead, thoroughly convincing as a school-aged girl suddenly thrust into an adult world, and its her down to earth nature and fundamental decency that make us like her so much and feel sorry for her when she's betrayed. The film does have its flaws, including a frequently intrusive sountrack, repetitive dream sequences and the unnecessary trope of beginning the film with a clip from the climax, but overall it's a solidly made and compelling look at a life cut short because of abuse and exploitation, and helps shine a light on human trafficking and sexual slavery, 2 things which have absolutely no place in any form of society.",

I understand it's a true story about a young girl living in, as the film states at the beginning \"Somewhere in the former soviet union\". It's actually set in a run-down dump of a place on the Estonian coast. The bleakness of this place sends shivers down your spine and you can't help feel sorry for this girl just for living there, let alone for what happened to her once her mother abandoned her. A very gritty story which not fail to sadden and disturb. Excellent performance by the previously unknown (to me) star of the film too.",

This film didn't necessarily enhance the message (the message to me was to essentially live long/prosper despite all the misery you may endure). But it still is powerful to those who forget how important this one life is.

The film's setting of a down-trodden, former Soviet union town and it's use of washed out greys are bleak enough, so when all goes horribly wrong for Lilja it's not surprising that it seems somewhat melodramatic. Regardless of it's flaws Lilja 4-Ever's savior is found in the performance of Oksana Akinshina, as an audience we cannot help but be drawn into her world completely and see what she sees (at some points, literally). Moodysson uses this as device for the audience to experience her suffering, though from the comfort of our armchairs, resulting in a somewhat bittersweet self-awareness, maybe this was his intention all along? With prominent themes of sexual exploitation and human trafficking, Lilja 4-Ever is mostly difficult viewing but there is redemption, maybe not the kind Lilja deserves but certainly the best we can expect from her situation. A film like this is important viewing for Western audiences, it's a small dose of reality, not sugar-coated although sometimes stylized and mostly honest.",

With no job and little money, Lilya finds friendship in 14 year old Volodya, who is himself rejected by his abusive father. The film itself is well-shot and directed, and the performances by the two young leads are simple yet engaging - it is truly difficult not to feel the despair felt by these characters as their lives progressively decline.Overall I would advise that this is not a film for the faint-hearted, but it is a very solid piece of film-making that, unfortunately, displays accurately and graphically the suffering and vulnerability caused by a very real issue.",

Now that movie definately provokes feelings, such as melancholy or depression, but that's it's success, after all it's dealing with one of the most cruel human situations/realities, prostitution ( which get worst at communities such as the one presented in the movie)..\n\nThe movie takes place in a former communist society, more precisely Russia, where people are having a hard time living! Most of them are selling their pride or becoming criminals in order to surive and make a living, a horrid one as you'll see.. Unfortunatelly many of them are doing those things mentioned before without their will and that's tragic... It's the main reason why they consider death as a good option in life!\n\nWhen I finished the movie I thought \" Why do people treat helpless people in need like animals??\" . The movie presents that in a rough way, which is so real.. Then again I thought, even animals get treated better than many people suffering from prostituion (kids or adults).. Also, many people protest for animal rights but nearly  no one is protesting against prostituion ( don't get me wrong but we must first save people and then animals)! It's almost like those people chose the way they wanted to live!!\n\nI definately recommend this movie to everybody.. We all must see what is happening in the world ( not only former communist societies who suffer a lot from poverty ) in order to try and do something about it..!",
