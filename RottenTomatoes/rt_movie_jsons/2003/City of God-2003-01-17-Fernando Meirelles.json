    "summary": "In the poverty-stricken favelas of Rio de Janeiro in the 1970s, two young men choose different paths. Rocket (Phellipe Haagensen) is a budding photographer who documents the increasing drug-related violence of his neighborhood. José \"Zé\" Pequeno (Douglas Silva) is an ambitious drug dealer who uses Rocket and his photos as a way to increase his fame as a turf war erupts with his rival, \"Knockout Ned\" (Leandro Firmino da Hora). The film was shot on location in Rio's poorest neighborhoods.",

The slum setting is very well adapted, the use of grainy film, muted and/or dark colors and the lack of establishing shots make for a very oppressive setting.

City of God, is unique in the sense, in the way that they bring the character into the \"limelight\" without any introduction, then they help embody that of the character through flashbacks, and their backstories are then displayed. Most movies in a messy way melds the incomplete character identity with the abridged story plot, which overall is a messy sludge that does not flow well. City of God is fluent in building up, and separating the character's life stories from that of the main plot, instead of diluting the plot, it gives the story a backbone, that helps support it. \n\nMy overall reaction to this film is that it is a great film. In the sense that you need to have an interest in Crime. Though it is a good film, the targetted audience is a niche one, which if a person's interest does not line up with that of intent, it is very hard for the movie to be engaging to them. I personally was extremely interested with the content, because it had introduced me to probably the best character development that I have seen from a film. I would recommend the movie to viewers whom like gore, crime, and want a better insight to third world countries whom are ridden with crime, and gangs. Though it is somewhat hard to gauge an overall ranking of this movie in a simple ranking system, for now I am in the ballpark of around a 4.3 star out of 5 star rating.",

That being said, it is also a stunning film and a truly fascinating look into life in Rio de Janiero's slums and the people who live there.  The streets are filled with children, some barely out of diapers, who brandish pistols and other weapons and make up the majority of various gangs each trying to get what they can.  The interesting thing is that the people who live here support these gangs for the most part as they give things to the townsfolk as well as take things themselves and it's an interesting social dilemma.  The entire running time is utterly intoxicating to behold and just a very well done film on every conceivable level and I would highly recommend it to those not easily disturbed or sickened by tough to watch visuals and violence.  The violence isn't just there for the sake of being violent but rather to tell a realistic story of life in the slums and the affect it has on a people.",

            "content": "\"Cidade de Deus\" is another spectacular Brazilian film. Firstly, even though it is only 2 hours long, it manages to introduce and develop well a lot of characters, even secondary ones: Cabeleira, Marreco (these two have less than 15 minutes on screen), Bené, Thiago, Angélica (Alice Braga), Cenoura and Mané Galinha (Seu Jorge) are all interesting and have at least one moment to shine. But the two protagonists are Buscapé (Alexandre Rodrigues, who is fantastic) and Zé Pequeno (Leandro Firmino, who is amazing). Both and Bené are the only characters who are deeply explored since their childhood. Zé Pequeno is a character who you surely don't want to fight with, he's a natural-born killer, and his main objective is to control every deal point in the slum, where almost everyone fears his presence. And Buscapé is the best protagonist possible for this story: first, he's not involved in the war, the war is between Cenoura and Zé Pequeno for the last deal point; second, he's not an \"NPC\", he has his own personality, his arc is probably one of the best ever made and how his story and the slum's one are intertwined is something deliciously written. He doesn't only tell his story but also establishes an extremely rich universe, possibly richer than the one from \"Estômago\", with an \"impartial\" vision because both Cenoura's and Zé Pequeno's sides impacted him positively and negatively.",

One of the best foreign language films there is and one of the best films personally seen recently, after a long time of being on my to see list but taking a while to get round to it due to being so busy and going through a difficult phase.\n\nPerhaps 'City of God' is not for everybody. It is not some audience members' idea of being entertaining, and is pretty unflinching, uncompromising and challenges the viewer. It does, with that being said, a superlative job bringing those qualities to life, and there are others, including myself, who judge films by what they set out to do rather than just wanting to be \"entertained\". There are many hugely entertaining films, while there are others that are clearly intended to be things other than entertainment and either are deep character studies, deliberate mood pieces and poignant dramas and shouldn't be denounced because of stereotypical views of what a film should be like.\n\n'City of God' is very well made, with some stunning and hard-hitting images, even if the budget is not high or enormous. It's all audaciously shot and edited with a lot of gritty atmosphere and sense of tension. The music fits well and has some haunting moments without being intrusive, while Fernando Meirelles's direction, particularly in the visual style, is superb.\n\nThe story is not hard to follow, with lots of provoking thought, tension and emotion, while the action is positively explosive, frighteningly brutal and designed with a real meticulousness. In no way either does it glamorise crime and gives an unflinching view of gangland rivalry, provoking comparisons to Martin Scorsese and 'Goodfellas'.\n\nAlexandre Rodrigues and Leandro Firmino da Hora are fabulous in their roles and carry the film and their compellingly real characters adeptly.\n\nOverall, a masterwork. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

The film follows the story of two men, Rocket played by Alexandre Rodrigues and Lil Z who is played by Leandro Firmino. The film follows the two characters as they embark on their lifelong journey of success, crime, and death. \n\n\tOne aspect that stood out to me was the factor of storytelling. I thought that it was amazing how the film portrayed the message of making life decisions and how one bad decision can plan out your entire life or ruin your future, in this case with the film it was either choosing between a life in crime or a life of real success. It shows how the environment you grow up in can affect how your lifestyle turns out in the future. I liked how the story was told and how the characters were introduced and how it gave flashbacks or told a story in order to give the character life and structure in the film. I also liked how the story somehow came into a full circle of crime and death. The way the story was told in order to build the structure for the two main characters was amazing. \n\n\tI really liked the film as a whole and how it portrays a good message of how desperation and poverty can lead you down the wrong path. I would recommend this movie to viewers who enjoy a deep, well rounded movie about crime. I give this movie a rating of 4 out of 5 stars.",

The film takes place in Brazil in the 1970s, where two young men growing up in the same slum of Rio, take two different life paths Rocket is struggling to become a photographer and Li'l Ze a kingpin. Rocket narrates the whole film giving us his view of life in the slums and how these two boys stumbled upon two completely different life choices. \n\nThe film uses lots of different camera techniques to capture the feeling of situations for example it starts with a powerful intro scene. Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues) is a teenager standing in the line of fire between two sides, Li'l Ze's ( Leandro Frimino) gang and the cops. He freezes as he doesn't know what side to choose or what to do, the camera starts swirling around him showing the two sides back and forth, eventually falling into what feels like a whirlpool, Rocket shrinks from being a teenager to a kid playing soccer in a sunny dirt field. The shot was an amazing attention grabber, pulling you into the movie wanting to understand why Rocket was placed in that situation and how it came to be in the first place. \n\nOverall this movie is now holding a place in my top five favorites. It was as exciting as it was sad. It provided great insight on how two people can shape themselves from being in the same situation to having two completely different outcomes. I would highly recommend this movie if you like plot twists along with a mixture of thrill and drama. It's a great cinematic piece, in my opinion, has a strong storyline that evolves throughout the film. It kept my eyes glued to the screen even though it was a long movie, I didn't get bored of it at all I rate it a 5/5.",

            "content": "\"City of God\" is a unique movie for me, because it is based on real-life events in the 80s about how two gangs led by Mane Chicken and Lil Ze fought an endless gang war in the \"Cidade de Deus\" or City of God. Now I didn't know that going in and I thought that the City of God was some sort of metaphor that I couldn't figure out. But it turned out to be the name of a 1960s housing project that became one of Rio de Janeiro's worst slums.\n\nThis film was filmed in the real-life City of God, twenty years after the aforementioned gang wars had finished. So this meant that the audience could experience what the City of God was like, but without giving the directors extra costs to make it work. The film used in this movie also enhances the immersion in this environment as it is muting brighter colors to make the environment bleaker. This movie's presentation in the way it is shot, the location where they filmed, and even the camera's they use, all work together to capture the atmosphere of the City of God. The presentation allows us to see the downsides of living in the City of God and gives us a good understanding of the living conditions of our characters.\n\nIn the City of God, people are influenced greatly by the environment and the problems that crowd the City of God. For example, we see children in the City of God become involved with the gangs and the crime that surround them. So this prompts the children to start their own gangs like \"The Runts\" and pursue crime as the bigger gangs do. But these actions actively put these children in danger as we see many times in this movie. This influence is effectively shown in the character Lil Dice (played by Douglas Silva) as he is the first child we see influenced in this way.\n\nLil Dice is a child who has taken inspiration from the local gang called \"The Tender Trio\" and Lil Dice gives these gangsters his ideas for crimes to commit. Lil Dice gives the trio the idea to hold up a motel and rob its inhabitants, and they go with Lil Dice in tow. They give Lil Dice a gun so he can give a warning shot if the police start coming near. However, after the gun is given to Lil Dice, we can see that he has now been given the golden opportunity to become a criminal like the Trio. Seeing his opportunity, Dice shoots the warning shot to get the trio to leave with the loot, while Lil Dice goes around murdering the inhabitants for his pleasure. \n\nThis is where Lil Dice stops being a kid and starts being a trigger-happy psychopath. But wait, the Tender Trio didn't believe in killing anyone… So how did Lil Dice become influenced by the Tender Trio to become this maniac? Lil Dice was influenced by the popularity and status of being a gangster, but his definition of a gangster was different than the Trio's. When he holds the gun for the first time we see his demeanor change like he feels the power of the weapon that he is holding. And what better way to use your new-found power than by shooting innocent inhabitants at a local motel…  That got dark fast.\n\nThe acting by Douglas Silva in this moment makes me believe that this kid enjoys killing every single person in that motel. I mean look at that kid's smile, that smile signifies everything going through his head at the moment. He feels powerful. Honestly, all this character wants in this movie is power. Not money, not friends, POWER. And we see how his pursuit of power affects him as an adult.\n\nAs an adult, he renames himself Lil Z (played by Leandro Firmino) and takes control of the drug trade in the City of God. Lil Z has finally become the biggest gangster in the city and he is very proud of this accomplishment. His gang becomes so huge, that the police force in the City of God, actively avoid the gang as they made hold-ups and crime rates fall drastically. So when Carrot's gang rises and starts a gang war against Lil Z's gang, the police force is ill-prepared to deal with the new violence and can do nothing but watch.\n\nThe reason why Carrot's gang started this war happened because Lil Z's best friend Benny was killed by Blacky (a member of Carrot's gang) and the death of Knockout Ned's younger brother. Carrot (played Matheus Nachtergaele) and Knockout Ned (played by Seu Jorge) both lead the fight against Lil Z's gang as partners. Knockout Ned is a weird leader for a gang because he doesn't consider himself as a gangster and he actively tries to avoid all crime and violence in general. But as soon as his brother dies, he sets his mind on vengeance so he joins the fight against Lil Z's gang. However, he only joins when he makes the gang promise not to kill anyone unless they are in Lil Z's gang.\n\nThis gives the character of Knockout Ned a bit more depth than the average gangster as he isn't in the gang for the pleasure of violence or crime, but simply to avenge his brother. This makes him an interesting person to root for in this type of context because you sympathize with this character's decision, but vengeance never solves any problems. When Ned goes for his first hold-up at a gun store, they steal the guns they need but he is still adamant about not killing any strangers. He even stops Carrot from killing a sales clerk in that same hold-up.\n\nHowever, when Carrot saves Ned from being shot during another hold-up, Ned's morals start to become more jaded. He decided to make an exception to his no-killing rule, which begs the question. When is it ok? The movie answers the question for you when it shows us Ned's gang robbing a bank, where Ned kills a security guard without a second thought. And as the movie famously wrote, \"the exception becomes the rule.\" \n\nBoth gangs are gearing up for the war by holding up gun stores, talking to arms dealers, and recruiting new members. Among these new members are literal children! Some are like Lil Z who just want to feel the rush of holding a gun and doing crime while others are like Ned and join to get revenge on another gang member. \n\nSo how does all this violence end for Lil Z and Knockout Ned? Well, this gang war comes to a violent conclusion where both sides fight in a final epic showdown where both Lil Z and Ned finally get consequences for their actions. Ned is fighting for his life on one side of the battle and he is attacked by a kid named Otto. Ned fatally wounds the child and tries to save the boy and asks him \"why did you join this f***ing war?\" Ned is concerned for the boy, as he never expected or wanted to see children fighting in these gangs.\n\nTurns out, that kid is the son of the security guard that Ned killed in the bank, and Ned is the reason he joined the fight in the first place. Otto joined Lil Z's gang to kill the man who killed his father, aka Ned. As soon as Ned turns to look for help, the child kills Ned by shooting him in the back. It feels kind of poetic that these two characters have such a similar character arc and that they go out the same way. They both achieve their goal of revenge, but at the expense of their own lives. \n\n\"Before you embark on a journey of revenge, dig two graves.\" - Confucius\n\nMeanwhile, Lil Z was shot and had to be carried off by other gang members until the police took him into custody. After the police drop him off in a secure location, Lil Z takes the moment to bribe the police by giving them everything valuable on him. The police accept the bribe and leave Lil Z alone in the streets. Here we see Lil Z at his lowest point in life as he has been stripped of everything meaningful to him like his money and his gang. Now that he is alone, he is powerless, and this vulnerability leads him to his death by the Runts.\n\nHaving the Runts kill Lil Z is a very interesting moment because in this movie the Runts are always looked upon as a joke. Heck, even Lil Z's gang terrorizes their gang at one point and shoots a couple of these children. But the Runts, who before were completely powerless against Lil Z and his entourage, now have the upper hand because they have a gun. Although we don't see the kid's face as he shoots Lil Z to death, I believe that in that moment, he had the same crazed smile Lil Z had when he killed those people in the motel. \n\nThis movie makes you wonder if leaving the City of God is even an option for these characters. But there is a character named Rocket (played by Alexandre Rodrigues), who gives the story the hope that it needs. Rocket is the younger brother of Goose, and he grew up in the same neighborhood as Lil Dice, so Rocket could go down a similar path to Lil Z, but he doesn't. I even thought that Rocket was bound to go down the same path, especially after Rocket promised NEVER to use his brother's gun.\n\nWhen I first heard that promise, I did not think that promise would be kept at all. I was very wrong in that assumption because Rocket fell in love with photography, which was a welcome diversion. Now as a person who lived in the slums, Rocket had to work extra hard to achieve his dreams. This involved him working with his father, saving money, and avoiding crime altogether, keeping his promise to his brother, even after he passed away. So while Rocket went on achieving his dreams to become a photographer, Lil Z started his rise to power.\n\nAfter we finish the origin of Lil Z and Rocket, a lot of this movie spends time focusing on fleshing out Lil Z's storyline, while we just see Rocket hang out. For the main character, this would usually be a bad thing but for the City of God, this is a very good thing. Rocket is focused on goals like getting a girlfriend or getting a better camera, which are simpler goals than becoming the number-one-gangster like Lil Z. He also never takes shortcuts to any of these goals by using crime, which makes you root for Rocket but also it makes us see how hard he is working to get out of the slums. \n\nMy favorite character moment in this movie is where Rocket and his friend are planning to do a hold-up for their first time. They go up to business after business only for Rocket to decide that it isn't worth it. His morality gets in the way of doing a hold-up because these people are just like Rocket in a way. They're trying to make an honest day's living by not exploiting the people around them. Rocket may want to succeed, but he decides that crime is not the way he wants to succeed, and that is powerful.\n\nWhen Rocket went to get his pictures for Lil Z processed and his pictures were used in a newspaper article without his permission, I thought the movie was going to take the hopeless concept much further. I thought the lady who used the photos would claim them as her own and gaslight Rocket in front of her superiors. Or the higher-ups would say that a person like him couldn't take these pictures and that they were probably someone else's. But the movie surprised me because the news company recognized his work, paid him, gave him access to better cameras/equipment, and even gave him a place to sleep when he didn't feel safe. \n\nSeeing Rocket achieve his dreams reveals the true purpose of this movie. While it wants to depict the City of God and gang violence in a real light, this movie is supposed to inspire hope in the darkest of places. This movie is trying to say that no matter where you're from, no matter how hard it is, anyone can find the means to succeed in their dreams. \n\nThis movie is a great piece of art and the writing kept me thinking way after I was done watching this movie. 9/10",

Cidade de Deus \"City of God\" has been called the best Brazilian movie ever made. It is easy to understand why that is. \n     The movie's writer— Bráulio Mantovani– does not shy away from presenting a hyper realistic depiction of the \"City of God\" favela. The audience quickly enters a world of extreme violence and poverty that can make watching the movie a visceral and jarring experience. The movie depicts heavy topics such as murder, rape, and drug use. This movie is only for mature audiences. \n     In this hostile world, even the best characters must sacrifice their moral principles in order to survive. The \"City of God\" favela is a place where children have no childhood and children murdering other children is commonplace. There are no heroes.\n     The police are outwardly racist towards the Afro-Brazilians who reside in the favelas. They label almost everyone who lives in \"City of God'' as a hoodlum. By selling guns to both gangs, they are complicit in the violence that engrosses the town. \n     The final scene of the movie is the most terrifying and memorable. A pack of ten and eleven year old boys walk through the favela after having just killed a rival gang member. They carry their guns with reckless abandon and plot about who they will kill next. It is a haunting ending to an exceptional movie. \"City of God\" throws the audience into a world characterized by senseless murder, chaotic dysfunction, and  underlying tragedy.",

Beginning with an uncomfortably close look at their hopeless childhood living conditions, we see how, for many of these kids, guns and violence are literally their only chance at getting a leg up on life.\n\nNot that they're all sympathetic victims, either: some people are just born bad. Most of them, actually, seem to prefer a short career of quick gains and tragic ends. Why slave away for fifty years, selling fish out of a rickety old cart like your parents, when you can just live fast and die young? Take the eventual warlord Li'l Dice/Li'l Z for example: a malicious orphan who discards his older friends' warnings and cuts a violent swath through the city, thugs and innocents alike, before he's old enough to shave. His brand of me-first barbarism spreads through the community like a plague, spawning countless imitators while earning fear and respect in equal measures.\n\nEven the kids who try to make good, like the conflicted narrating photographer Rocket, dip their fingers into that drug-fueled honey jar when life gets tough. It's inescapable and, for a while, it all works out. The gangs enforce their own rules, a strict code that effectively eliminates random crime and establishes a sense of predictable normalcy for the unconnected population. It can't last forever, and it doesn't (there's an intense, if fleeting, power vacuum after the two bigwigs finally settle their score), but for a time that senseless chaos somehow produces its own twisted sense of order.\n\nCruel and unflinching, with an appropriately frantic visual character, City of God swings with power.

In his circle of friends the sadistic Lil Dice, Leandro Firmino de Hora, quickly rises to power as he encourages the members of the gang to take on riskier jobs and be more violent, eventually killing Rocket's brother. Dice later becomes a corrupt drug lord as Rocket is pursuing photography for the newspaper he is employed by but the two intersect when Rocket decides to purchase drugs from one of his associates. A war develops between two rival gangs and the enemies that Dice has created over time team up against him as his tyranny begins to have a negative impact on the people in the housing development which has grown into a large slum by the 1980s.\n\nThe film is able to track the growth of this area that starts out as a small, relatively uninhabited development into a sprawling mess filled with drug dealers, homeless people and sensitive types just trying to get by. Our protagonist is the third type of person and he will often turn a blind eye to the wrongdoings that occur around him and lets go of painful events like the murder of his brother. This is a man programmed to survive and not to get caught up in petty matters of pride and dignity. In fact most of the characters involved in this story have no particular agenda other than to scrounge up enough money to pay for food and shelter. When we understand this it is easy to see why the film's emotions are somewhat muted as the characters in the film have numbed themselves from feeling love, pain, sadness and a myriad of other emotions too deeply.\n\nIt helps also that our way into this story is essentially an observer and not the difficult to empathize with Dice or the handsome, beloved Knockout Ned, Seu Jorge, as his quiet presence lurks in the background and drinks in a conflict that he willfully removes himself from. We kid ourselves as an audience and would like to believe that we too would not be drawn in by the glamor of the drug fuelled lifestyle led by many of the gang leaders during the 1980s but the truth is that Rocket is fairly exceptional in his own way. The film's love for journalism, the ethics involved and joy of finding just the right angle to tell a story from, is clear throughout as we feel like journalists piecing together bits of information and seeing why two acquaintances later have a major impact on one another's lives. The screenplay is the driving force behind the greatness of the framing of the film as a lesser screenplay would have gone for cheap thrills and put us in the mindset of a character who would have been more theatrical but boring within five minutes. The film moves along at it's own pace but always presents something of interest to the audience and gives us reason to root for certain outcomes.\n\nEven audiences resistant to the idea of a dreaded ‘Foreign' film will probably find a lot to enjoy here as a large part of the film is taken up with well choreographed action sequences and for film buffs the screenplay is enjoyable to dig into.",

The film is given thanks to a young man who does not share anything of what happens in the favela and seeks to get ahead as a photographer.

Because without being so, City of God wouldn't have been the easiest hard-to-watch movie to be watched! I know that sounds weird, but I'm not kidding this movie is so disturbing and shocking, but its vibrant visual style made it impossible to look away from.\n\nLike the visuals and colors, the soundtrack is so vivid and dynamic to mirror the vicious cycle of violence in the eponymous city, and the slums of Rio de Janiero.\n\nThat being said, City of God's exhilarating visuals and soundtrack aren't the only, nor even the main two reasons that made it unbelievably engrossing. As what really dazzled me the most this masterpiece is its narrative control. Considering the fact that this movie has this abundance of characters, which all of them are almost equally important, and a non-linear storytelling, it's beyond belief that I haven't felt lost even for a moment. Instead, I found myself caring for each of the main characters for equal measure. Every time our protagonist, Rocket mentions one of the new important characters while narrating the story, I start getting worried a bit because I think this would harm the narrative thread of the story, and make it lose its balance a bit. But every time I ended up being totally wrong till I eventually said to myself: \"More characters, please!\" By the way, the use of voice-over narration in this movie is exceptional!\n\nEvery single character is as grounded as its compelling and throughly interesting. And they are brought to life by some of the most authentic, honest, and uncompromising performances I've ever seen in film. All the non-pros actors delivered downright terrific performances that I really can't single hand one of them.\n\nThe only issue I've with City of God is its first fast-paced 20 minutes. Putting aside the magnificent opening scene, everything in the rest of the first fifty to twenty minutes happens very quickly that kept me from being engaged from the start.\n\nPowerful, visceral, uncompromising, yet honest, Cidade de Deus is a Latin masterpiece, and easily one of the this century's best movies, so far. I really regret not seeing it till recently, it's a MUST-SEE!\n\n(9/10)",

Obviously I'm no expert, but it seemed painfully realistic.  The film's director used real-life slum-boys to add to the film's authenticity.\n\nWatch this film! You will not regret it.  It isn't an easy ride.  It's tough and brutal and forces you to confront the worst of humanity, which is why it is so good.

Two things though, the entire movie requires subtitles as it is explicitly spoken in Portugese or Brazilian slum slang, and secondly, the film features harrowing scenes of children shooting other children among other third world atrocities. But director Fernando Meirelles directs with such vibrant energy and heart and passion for his story that he never glamorizes or uses the violence for the sake of popcorn entertainment. Beneath the copious amounts of violence, lies a study on the consequences of the murder and the sweeping scope of people and property that the gang wars in the story affect. \nAlso, just sheerly on a technical level, the movie is an absolute marvel. Meirelles understanding of pacing the story by at lighting pace,all while shifting between different periods of time, and holding it all together perfectly is marvelous.  Also his staging of set pieces, particularly the shootouts, and his clever manipulation lighting and score lead to a unique and visceral viewing experience. The characters, even though speaking foreign tongue as to that of my native english, are incredibly fleshed out and portrayed wonderfully by mostly non-professional actors. The heartbreaking send-off party was a technical masterpiece and a riveting, ultra suspenseful climax. Must watch for any film enthusiast, but again, be able to stomach gruesome violence and disturbing content and images. Still, a masterpiece to the highest order and right of in the top echelon of crimes movies such as The Godfather (1&2), The Goodfellas, and The Departed.",

            "content": "City of God is an amazing film.  Its characters are very detailed in personality (as they should, this being based on a true story), and the development of characters like Tiago and Knockout Ned are marvelous.  That being said, Rocket (the protagonist of the film) doesn't see much change in himself, the movie just kind of throws situations at him.  Speaking of situations, this movie seems as if it can't really keep itself to clear good and bad characters.  For instance, Little Ze', the movie's main villain, a guy who, throughout the movie, does some terrible things, and kills a TONNE of people, is not really someone who you actively hate.  In a similar vain, Ned, one of the most generally nice and morally pure people in the movie, ends up coming off as more desperate than heroic.  This DOES work in some cases, but here, it just serves to confuse those watching it.  And this movie is very confusing by itself.  \n                       For instance, at one point, they talk about a \"Notorious guy\" in the City of God, building it up for quite a bit of time, but when he's actually caught doing his notorious action, it's kind of forgotten and never again brought up in the movie, it really serves no other purpose than to just kind of transition from one part of the story to the other. \n               Another thing that bugs me about this movie is how they have a few VERY interesting characters that only get about 5 minutes of screen time to make way for Ze' or Rocket.  For instance, at the beginning of the movie they introduce a guy named Clipper, but about 15 minutes down the road, he just kinda walks away, apparently to become a \"Man of god\" and we don't hear from him again.  This would be ok if Rocket and Ze' didn't already have the most complicated stories on the face of the earth.  Seriously, you would need a more complicated lore than Star Wars just to map out Ze' and Rocket's favorite dessert.  And that's presuming it's actually able to be found.  Because for as much time they put into these guys stories, all you really know at the end of it all is that they \"Dead person A was their friend\" or that they \"fell in love with Dead person B\", because everyone dies in this move.  Really, besides the random deaths and occasional love story, you really don't get much else.  Which, again, wouldn't be so bad if they weren't the soul focus of this two hour movie with loads of unique and interesting characters.  \n\n                  In fact, there was about a period of 15 minutes when the story switches over to one of the secondary characters in the movie, Benny.  And you know what, it was one of the best parts of any movie I've seen to this date.  Because Benny has one of the most intricate personalities put to film, but then, for reasons I don't need to explain, it switches over to the beginnings of a guy named Knockout Ned, and guess what, it's amazing!  But of course it very promptly kicks Ned off-screen so that we can show the traumatic lives of Ze' and Rocket. \n\n                  So in conclusion, City of God does a few things very well, and has quite a bit of narrative potential.  But unfortunately every good intricate character and situation is buried under meaningless deaths and Ze' killing stuff for no reason.",

Crime is presented as the major occupation for youth - a continuous cycle for power, revenge, and survival. There are times when the violence is too self-consciously stylized, but the actions perpetrated by and towards children, are always horrifying. Aexandre Rodgrigues as Rocket is the narrator, who uses photography as a means to escape the life. Directed by Fernando Meirelles with Katia Lund credited as co-director.

It has a little coming-of-age drama, and tells about some boys who grow up and take very different paths in their lives. It seems to be a real struggle for kids to lift themselves out of this difficult place to live, and to escape the dangers of the drug trade. As a result of the atmosphere in the City of God there are no perfectly pure heroes, or even perfectly evil villains. In fact, one of the most interesting aspects of this movie is the way they manipulate the audience into rooting for different people at different times. Even Lil Ze, who starts out as the clear-cut villain, actually brings peace to the slums for a time and we sympathize with him when he experiences loss. I also loved how they gave such distinct nicknames to all the characters. Where it could be easy to get lost in the sea of faces, we are easily able to tell everyone apart because they have such unique names. I did struggle to stay invested in the film, however. I wasn't finding a consistent story arc. It almost felt like a historical film or something because we are just shown events in one era, then we move on to the next without any change in our protagonist or his situation. In fact the entire theme of City of God was basically the cyclical nature of violence in the slums. So by the end the entire story starts all over again. This is one of those films that was interesting to watch, but not something I would recommend to most viewers.",

Back then the movie had so many aspects that popped as being sucked from films such as matrix and pulp fiction especially pulp fiction that it looked like a pastiche of those movies.It looked like a movie cut for the american audience taste. That Meireles had done a crafty job point by point to give more of the same stuff. Well today with the distance of time and a lot of movies after pulp fiction one doest see this faults pops..this manerisms have been incorporated on the universal language of films. And even doe the movie itself looks a tad superficial on its strong aim to be entertaining it have so many strong points that makes it well worth to watch it. First it is entertaining, this on itself is not bad at all. it have a great edition.. very crafty. the camera is smart, no frame is waisted, the narrative is very tight.. one goes out of the movie thinking what was left out..this is a way better thing than ending with the impression that a lot of things should have been left off. The screenplay is a masterpiece. Ive read the book that served as source and I assure that it was used strictly as a prime source.. the screen writer used it much like a sculptor uses a rock to extract a figure from within. So if this movie is somehow superficial on its general mood, it has bits of human greatness, it has more than one layer on its narrative structure. It is a film one can see several times thanks for the smart dialogue, with lots of catchy quotes, the great acting, that looked as have been sprouted from the film, the precious film and addition but mainly for its multi layered narrative that places this story on the realm of our universal miths.",

This was certainly the case in 'City of God.'  The more I thought about it, the more intrigued I became with this film.  The fact that in the slums of Rio there exists problems with young hoodlums who sell drugs is not something that I can wrap my had around easily.  And when I say problems, I mean problems.  People are dying over control of the slum and drug money often determines fates.  It was also great to have a somewhat true story of a photographer named Rocket who only wanted to rise out of the City of God instead of becoming a hoodlum like his older brother.  As time goes along, Rocket finds himself in the middle of a bloody drug war between the gangs of Lil' Ze and Carrot.  Lil' Ze in particular is noted for having the need to kill and finds pleasure in it.  He even kills Rocket's older earlier in the film when he was just a wee lad.  When I finished watching this film, I was torn as to whether I thought it was awesome or not.  Then the more I thought about it, the more I remembered just how disturbing, real, and intense this film was.  There are several scenes that will leave you stunned.

The movie takes place in the City of God, an area in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, far from the places shown on the touristy postcards. It's a slum, and it seems like you'd be lucky to make it into your 20's living there. The story follows a young man named Rocket as he aspires to be a photographer, while showing bleak backdrop of the drug trade and constant gang warfare in the area. The director purposefully uses little-known actors to make the feel of the movie more authentic, and the way he presents the material through the stunning cinematography and a superb script is amazing. I'm shocked it didn't succeed in getting nominated for best Foreign Language film at the Oscars, but nonetheless it is a powerful and important film that earns its critical praise.

There are many camera angles and editing techniques which would not seem out of place in a Tarantino movie. There are also a number of sub headings on show as the story is split into different characters with a number of flackbacks to earlier scenes.\nAs long as you were willing to give reading subtitles a try, then City of God is definitely a film worth watching.

            "content": "\"I have crawled across the burning sands to the city of God; when I scratched upon the gates, oh Lord, I felt so... odd!\" Hey, changing \"gold\" in that rhyme scheme worked out, because it's not like people remember Pearls Before Swine well enough to notice or care that I also changed \"old\" in the rhyme scheme. Man, I don't know if, at the moment, I'm more weirded out by the thought of psychedelic country-folk rock, or by the idea of a Brazilian crime gang. I guess this is pretty much \"The Godfather\" of Brazilian cinema, not because it's \"that\" good, or because \"God\" is in the title, but because you're not going to find a better gangster film in Brazil, because no other gangster film exists in Brazil. I suppose you can find organized crime in most every part of the world, so I guess I'm most blown away to find that Brazil has hoods, complete with gangs that are in turn complete with black people. There must not be a whole lot of them up there, because looking at Brazilian booty, you'd figure that they would flock there in greater masses than tropical birds. ...Well, it sounds like I better not flock there any time soon if the black people over there are like the ones portrayed in this film, only, you know, less engaging, which isn't to say that this film, as good as it is, consistently compels.\r\n\r\nPart of, if not an instrumental influence in the modern movement of being more harsh with gangster films, this effort breaks up relative sophistication as a weighty drama with grime and disturbances, many of which are kind of unnervingly gratuitous, or at least feel like it, based on their contradiction of the taste. Of course, there was always going to be a certain grime throughout this film, as it is driven by characters who aren't in the strictest sense likable, and although they are portrayed well enough in the script and the performances to endear, it's easy to feel a bit distanced from almost, if not decidedly irredeemable figures when the drama loses its taste at times. Of course, my biggest problem with the characters and the concept behind their unnerving story mainly stems from the not easy to hide issue of familiarity, because no matter how unique this crime drama is in so many ways, when it falls into conventions, it falls hard. The tropes, no matter how limited, bland things up, though not as directly as dull times in which quiet \"intensity\" is relied a touch too heavily upon, or at least dips in momentum under the weight of draggy spots in structuring which help in getting the final product its 130-minute runtime, but only help. What really makes the film so long is a layered, almost episodic narrative that is compelling in its extensive meditation upon the rise of organized crime in Rio de Janeiro, as well as convoluted, jarring through layer and layer, and hitting some focal inconsistencies along the way, until the final product actually begins to lose focus, at least in its sense of progression. I'm a little uncertain about saying that the film loses momentum after a while, because it's always compelling, and the plot actually thickens in concept as it goes along, but the storytellers still ask you to embrace a lot, and at times, it's too hard to for the drama to be all that strong. Nonetheless, as I said, the film consistently compels through all of its errors in judgment, partly because it rarely misses a beat when it comes to a certain artistic style.\r\n\r\nEd Cortês's and Antonio Pinto's score seems to be rather unevenly played with in this often quiet thriller, but it's worth waiting for, what with its instrumentally impressive, musically nifty and all around solid Portuguese flavor, whose value by its own artistic right and in the context of the film goes matched by that of Oscar-nominated cinematography by César Charlone whose intentionally noisy definition and grimy Coloration, all behind delicately uneven lighting, make for a grit that is pretty attractive in its sheer uniqueness, alone. This and other technical highlights help craft quite the stylistic vision for this film, so if the aesthetic grit is consistently tasteful with nothing else, then it is with artistic style, more than it is with substance. On top being a little convoluted and episodic, this crime thriller gets to be a little too dirty with its content and characterization for the its own good, but dramatic potential remains rich, as this gritty dramatization of organized Brazilian crime carries both intrigue and depth, on paper, alone. By paper, I am referring both to the concept, and to the script, because when you can cut through the grime in Bráulio Mantovani's writing, you can expect to find wit, as well as characterization which is generally effective in its nastiness, further sold as endearing by the performances. Real charisma and emotion found across the board with this sizable cast does a lot to define the nuance of this drama with subtlety and, if you will, grace, but it's a performance not found in this cast of acting talents which can make or break the engagement value of this stylish and gritty dramatic thriller. Ranging between frantic and slow, direction that is primarily handled by Fernando Meirelles, and also taken on by Kátia Lund, more often than not, finds comfortable middle ground, with style that is just flashy enough to entertain, and a steady dramatic hand that, with an audacious attention to consequential violence and other gutsy elements, sinks its teeth into nerves with anything from tension to an almost moving selling of gritty emotions. The film does require a fair bit of patience, I'm not going to lie, but it is effective much more often than not, with raw guts which are sure to compel anyone willing to embrace a drama so audacious.\r\n\r\nBottom line, the film gets to be questionable with its grimy visuals and characterization, as well as conventional, dry, draggy and uneven with its arguably overblown story, whose shortcomings are overshadowed enough by solid scoring, cinematography, writing, acting and direction which make Fernando Meirelles's \"City of God\" predominantly effective and ultimately rewarding as a breakthrough in foreign and gritty grime thrillers.\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",

It's a very gritty film, but it depicts a stark way of life that isn't shown much in films. Set mostly in the Cidade de Deus suburb of Rio de Janeiro, 3 small time crooks Shaggy (Jonathan Haagensen), Clipper (Jefechander Suplino) and Goose (Renato de Souza) are in a gang known as the Tender Trio. They do small crimes, but it snowballs into murder one day, witnessed by Goose's younger brother Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues), who later on in the 1970's, finds himself being drawn into the world of organised crime, when in life he just wants to become a photographer. The drugs in the area are being sold by Li'l Zé (Leandro Firmino da Hora), but he soon finds competition from Benny (Phellipe Haagensen) and Knockout Ned (Seu Jorge). It's not a film for everyone, but Meirelles keeps the energy and rhythm up, and it's a tale of survival in a dangerous part of the world, which has since been contained and cleaned up since the 1970's. The film was successful enough to earn a spin off TV series City of Men, and another film with some of the cast returning.",

The rapid-fire cinematography and truthful performances of ghetto life in Rio are the main appeal for me. That being said, I empathize greatly with the protagonist Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues). He likes people too much to cause direct harm; unlike myself, Rocket has been under many circumstances that would explain why he would harm others, if he did, but he doesn't. The closest he comes is watching someone get killed and taking pictures of the person's body for his job. That's as far as revenge ever goes for him. The other characters are as equally interesting. There is Lil Ze (Leandro Firmino da Hora), so sociopathically absorbed in the gangster life that he finds zero pleasure in anything other than asserting dominance. By his side is his near opposite Benny (Phellipe Haagensen), still a killer and product of a poor environment but aims to use his wealth and power for helping those who once struggled with him. Knockout Ned (Seu Jorge) may be my favourite. Breaking Bad had five seasons worth of time to transform a weak, but caring man into an unapologetic killer. City of God similarly transforms Knockout Ned in one movie. Heck, honestly, it was done in one especially compelling minute of the movie. And that minute was practically a montage, albeit with some narration over the robberies. Much credit to director Fernando Meirelles for making that work, with what could be described as journalistic integrity. Okay, I take it back. What I love about my favourite news documentaries is much like what I love about City of God. But you know what City of God has over the documentaries? Excitement. Humour. Refusal to compromise.",

It goes about demonstrating this idea by showing a succession of people trying to take over the ghetto with violence. Some of the candidates are kind-hearted Robin Hoods (Tender Trio), some are accidental gangsters (Knockout Ted), some are simply evil (Lil'Z) and some are a bunch of prepubescent kids (Runts). They all use violence to pursue crime. They all fail. Even as the Runts seem to rule the day at the end, having killed Lil'Z, you know things can change tomorrow (they're like, 10 years old). These four external plots are joined by an internal plot of our protagonist, Rocket, successfully avoiding a life of crime by luck and some fortitude.\n\nThe movie seems to want to be more than an episodic chorus of violence. It strains to show that the ghetto and a broken system makes crime and criminality inevitable. It shows this mainly through the reluctant criminal of Knockout Ted who is basically forced to become a gangster after trying to live virtuously. But this idea is relegated to secondary importance for me: much of the violence is glorified, and our hero does escape a life of crime (even though he is no where near as virtuous as Ted was), providing contrary evidence to the idea that crime is inevitable.\n\nA change of protagonist from Rocket into Knockout Ted might have gotten this movie onto this bigger idea.\n\nThat's not to say the movie doesn't have some pretty memorable scenes, locations and the fact that it's a Brazilian production based on true characters is pretty awesome. I just think it could have mixed its potent ingredients together towards a bigger idea.\n\nMy Story Chart of the movie is at StoryCharts.ca.",

Honestly, in a place where children uphold violence and crimes as their highest principles, where is hope? And when police has done nothing but reinforcing the people's torture there, what else can be done? I am not sure how much has the actual City of God has improved in the past 10 years, but according to the everlasting news reports on the rough lives at slums in Rio de Janeiro and crimes in other cities like Sao Paulo, the inclusion of Brazil, as well as India and South Africa as world powers will be the biggest joke on earth, for their software are no different from the Third World at the moment. There is still a long way to go for these political infants. The glimmer of hope offered by Rocket is still only good-dust unavailable to the mass.",

I admit I'm privileged, and I admit there are many, many improvised people living in absolute deplorable conditions around the world. But for me film is an escape from the mundane, materialistic and selfish world, and an escape into the wonder of collaborative story telling. \n\nBut once in a while, a reality check is an order, and man oh man, City of God is a strong cup of coffee in the morning. It's the tale of two brothers in the dirt poor and violent slums of Rio de Janeiro, as one becomes a successful photographer, and the other sinks into the world of gangs and drug dealing. And it holds nothing back as it bluntly hits you with the harrowing violence and corruptness of gang violence in the slums.\n\nMake no mistake, City of God's poignancy is of a completely different magnitude. It's a shocking movie, not for it's all out violence, but how intensely depraved and realistic it feels. I never once felt like I was being manipulated into feeling compassion because the writing, directing it's unique approach to storytelling are exquisite. Simply put, City of God looks like a documentary, but doesn't feel like one. Pure genius on Fernando Meirelles' part.\n\nWhy does City of God fall one star short of perfection? It may sound unfair and childish, but I didn't enjoy this movie. I know I wasn't supposed to, but I believe enjoyment is a virtue in a movie, and blunt reality belongs elsewhere.",

Shows what life is like in one of several favelas of Rio de Janeiro for these children and young people growing up in a world of violence. Buscapé (main character) is a boy like any other that has dreams to realize: be a reporter; having a girlfriend; cash in his wallet. Dreams difficult to achieve in this slum standing gang war between Zé Pequeno (also main character) and Mané Galinha, for reasons both territory and personal revenge. Where we see also the lives of many people in this slum, his experiences and his thoughts on life as they have.\nAnd the most impressive in this film is the casting. In the film we can only see a maximum of 2 actors, because all other characters including the main character, are even people who live in the favela City of God, and they make everything real (the film is based on true events if you do not know).

The story is deep and twisting and if you dont pay enough attention (as i did the first time through) you will tune in and have no idea what has happened since you last watched.

Throughout the movie I was completely baffled as to how directors Meirelles and Lund were able to capture such a unflinching portrayal of the despicable characters without dragging the film into shoxploitation. Some scenes are overwhelmingly REAL in every visceral way - please be warned, this is not for children or sensitive adults. However, for the less squeamish, this highly original film will transport you as completely as any other foreign film centering around Rio can.",

Going into it, it had everything it needed to be a great Brazilian film, except for a sound story structure, proving to be my main criticism with the picture. The first half of this film will satisfy, supplying the viewer with a rich environment full of realistic traits and character, a lead protagonist/narrator, and overall interesting set up for a good story. The story gets lost, however, and ends up being a drag to continue following throughout. Well executed transitions, script and cinematography are the things that will leave a good taste in your mouth.",

With no money, no education, little or no opportunity, people tend to get destructive in nature, and City of God can't be faulted for showing what can happen in such circumstances. Is it a imbalanced world, sure, but any imbalanced story won't have the same impact when the bad is balanced and contrasted against the very bad. The non linear story telling and narration, I feel hurt the films aspirations, as I feel it's always best to let the action unfold and let the audience draw their own conclusions. The violence is graphic, and while it's not different than any other gangster film in its essence, I didn't see it as powerful as it is in other films, because there is no contrast in this film, its all black all the time. The film looks good, and Meirelles doesn't pull any punches, but at some point it becomes a little tiring for the viewer, and by the end the violence has lost it visceral power. Has the audience been numbed like the protagonists have? One could say that, but then again I always preferred films that give me something more than just brute force.",
