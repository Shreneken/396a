    "summary": "In this live-action film based on the favorite children's tale, the trouble-making Cat in the Hat (Mike Myers) arrives at the home of bored young Sally Walden (Dakota Fanning) and her brother, Conrad (Spencer Breslin), while their mother (Kelly Preston) is out. The family's pet fish (Sean Hayes) objects to the Cat's presence, but that doesn't stop the hat-wearing giant feline from trying to have fun, no matter how much destruction is left in his wake.",

It was conceived in development hell, and it shows and its truly a sight to behold. I watched this repeatedly as a child which is why I turned out so great\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 anyway I have recently revisited this masterpiece and can honestly say it was amazing to watch with the group and the next time we revisit it we will definitely be smashed. \nWhy do I like it so much and why do I disagree and agree with the critics response to this movie? 1. I like it because it's entertaining as fack too. I disagree with critics because this is clearly not a movie to be taken seriously and this moves on to my next point 3. yes it taints the late great Dr Suess' visions and themes and basically its an insult to his work and that's where I do agree with critics, this should not have been written in a day (because the writing and story definitely implies that) and should not have been called the cat in the hat because its guaranteed at least some of its money back. That being said I was entertained throughout the entire due to its bizarre performances that are unforgettable and just the shear amount of stupid facking \"adult\" jokes I just can't hate the film. The one thing I would change besides not having this as a movie at all would be keeping the deleted scenes in, yes that's right I want the cat in the hat directors cut, the extended cut, the ultimate edition, the special edition, and the sequel the cat in the hat 2 nuclear boogaloo.\nI reckon if you were to ask anyone whos seen this poorly written (they don't even bother to write in rhyme), poorly directed (wonder what he told the actors to do), poor child performances with hilarious adult performances movie they would instantly respond with a quote from their favourite scene because its memorable in the worst way possible and I can only respect it for that. As for themes there are none, they try and force feed you the bullshit family is whats most important (I was half expecting vin diesel to show up) the cat doesn't arc hes just kind of the same as he was when hes introduced  and he just cleans up the house with his machine while listening to smash mouth and that sentence alone is the reason you should watch it.\nThis is the best disaster I've ever seen. Would watch on a drink, can watch and not think, would watch so high, as if I'm in the sky.\n-10/10",

Critics call it \"potty humour\" but visionarys like you and I know it as art. The modern Mona Lisa if you will. This extravagant tale of of two infants and a talking feline will be sure to blow your socks away with its stunning and grandiose cinematography (recently named the best of the 21st century by acclaimed critic and self proclaimed \"Cat in The Hat SuperFan\" Luke Carter). This fantastic, family friendly extravaganza is filled to the brim with witty jokes that (according to the Sun newspaper in 2020) forced Peter Kay into his long hiatus as he no longer felt that he could compete. It really is true pioneer when it comes to modern comedy as we know it today and for that reason is the greatest price of film to ever come out of Hollywood. 10/10 would recommend.",

            "content": "\"This cat falls flat.\"\n\nHow misguided this statement is! The critics, and their harsh criticism, are misplaced. They don't understand the meaning of this film, nor its target demographic, nor its philosophical significance. IT IS NOT ABOUT A CAT IN A HAT.\n\nThis is a film which touches on all elements of the human condition. Love. Humour. Death. Poop. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with a cat wearing a hat. Those who say otherwise would surely oppose the freedom of women to wear what they please: to that I say, get in the bin you chauvinistic pigs.\n\nFar from being crude in the negative sense, the crudeness of this film is the bedrock of its philosophical argument. The society shown is itself crude: the perfectly kept gardens, the sameness of the cars, and the obsession of Mr. Humberfloob with 'hygiene'. It begs the question: what does hygiene even mean in such a society? Surely it is nothing more than a token gesture: a sign that one cares about oneself and one's fellow citizens.\nHowever, Mr. Humberfloob's obsessive hygiene habits are in contrast with his ruthless persona as a boss: in one of the film's first scenes, he is seen immediately firing a new employee. Later, we see him force Joan to return to the office, despite his knowledge that she is without childcare. He clearly has no regard for the feelings of other people: he epitomises society.\n\nThe Cat, on the other hand, is ultimately caring, despite being an undeniably 'messy' character. Quite literally: with the help of the 'things', he engenders in the Walden household the \"mother of all messes.\"\nWe see thus how the society pictured presents a facade of cleanliness, both in a physical and moral sense, whilst in fact committing atrocities on the level of the everyday, and beyond.\n\nSuch a contrast is highlighted most clearly by the character of Lawrence (or Larry, as the cheeky Conrad likes to call him, much to the dismay of the 'polite' characters of Sally and Joan). Presenting to Joan an image of a successful businessman, we soon see that he is in fact deeply in debt, as well as portraying a false physical self-image (false teeth, a belly holder). Larry is, therefore, the exact opposite of the Cat: a poser, whose crudeness is uncovered only by intense investigation. Of course Larry would hate the Cat, for the Cat is everything that Larry wishes to be: kind, perhaps rich, resourceful, well-received by the children, and, as the Cat himself narrates at the end:\n\n\"dashing and charming,\nno doubt about that.\nHe was witty and cultured...\nand, well, very endearing...\nand tremendously attractive,\nbut in a sort of real way.\nYou know, kind of\nan approachable way that I think\nyou don't see these days...\"\n\nUltimately, Larry's 'approachability' and acceptability is a facade: he cannot meet the stringent standards of this 'perfect' society, and is therefore forced to disguise himself. This leads to inner turmoil and poor self-esteem, which is taken out on Conrad and most obviously witnessed in Larry's sick mission to send Conrad to military school.\n\nTo those who rate The Cat in the Hat lowly, I encourage you to look inside yourself. Is it, perhaps, that you feel too reflected in the character of Larry, and wish to be more like the Cat? Perhaps you feel rejected by your own society, and are tired of pretending. So I say this not with derision, but with compassion: be yourself, be kind, be loving, and ultimately, be more like The Cat. \n\nThe world will begin to look a lot brighter once you do so.",

            "content": "Dr. Seuss's stories are funny and charming, and some of them like How the Grinch Stole Christmas and Horton Hears a Who have been made into surprisingly good films.(Jim Carrey was brilliant as the Grinch but the animated short is a wonderful timeless classic) However, Cat in the Hat is just a joke of a film. I saw it with four of my friends at the cinema for my 12th birthday 5 or 6 years ago, and all of us hated it.\n\nThe main problem is the casting of Mike Myers, or miscasting more like. He was good as Austin Powers and Shrek, but his performance as the Cat was beyond cringe worthy. There were times when he had a preposterous Scottish accent that didn't suit him at all(it sounded nothing like the voice he used on Shrek), and all the Cat had to do was make terrible fart jokes, and sing songs with lyrics that were impossible to decipher.\n\nThe script was terrible, full of fart jokes and clich\u00e9d one liners. Kids are most unlikely to laugh at the overused bathroom humour, they will a find it unfunny, or b find it offensive. None of the 5 of us laughed once in this movie, other than when the Cat was singing.\n\nThe film does have two redeeming qualities. One is some nice scenery in the latter half of the film. The other is Dakota Fanning, who was the only actress in the film who made some effort to make her character true to the story. Kelly Preston was okay, and Alec Baldwin is very good in films like the Shadow and Hunt For Red October, but in films like this and Thomas and the Magic Railroad, he is completely wasted as the villain.\n\nAll in all, a lifeless and unfunny film. It isn't quite as abysmal as Home Alone 4, but it is really awful. I am sorry if I have offended anyone, I genuinely hate criticising movies, but Cat in the Hat really did take the biscuit. 1/10 for the scenery and Fanning. Bethany Cox",

I saw it with four of my friends at the cinema for my 12th birthday 5 or 6 years ago, and all of us hated it.\n\nThe main problem is the casting of Mike Myers, or miscasting more like. He was good as Austin Powers and Shrek, but his performance as the Cat was beyond cringe worthy. There were times when he had a preposterous Scottish accent that didn't suit him at all(it sounded nothing like the voice he used on Shrek), and all the Cat had to do was make terrible fart jokes, and sing songs with lyrics that were impossible to decipher.\n\nThe script was terrible, full of fart jokes and clich\u00e9d one liners. Kids are most unlikely to laugh at the overused bathroom humour, they will a find it unfunny, or b find it offensive. None of the 5 of us laughed once in this movie, other than when the Cat was singing.\n\nThe film does have two redeeming qualities. One is some nice scenery in the latter half of the film. The other is Dakota Fanning, who was the only actress in the film who made some effort to make her character true to the story. Kelly Preston was okay, and Alec Baldwin is very good in films like the Shadow and Hunt For Red October, but in films like this and Thomas and the Magic Railroad, he is completely wasted as the villain.\n\nAll in all, a lifeless and unfunny film. It isn't quite as abysmal as Home Alone 4, but it is really awful. I am sorry if I have offended anyone, I genuinely hate criticising movies, but Cat in the Hat really did take the biscuit. 1/10 for the scenery and Fanning. Bethany Cox",

This film obviously \u2018adapts' the famous story of the same name by Dr Seuss, however the details of the book make up all but a small bit of the films plot. Instead The Cat in the Hat (2003) goes for the low hanging fruit of jokes, weird imagery and just absolute chaos.\n\nThe Cat himself is actually amusing at points, strictly thanks to the amount of effort Mike Meyers puts into the role, over than that he can come across as obnoxious and annoying, plus his character design may terrify young audiences, which is its target audience. However saying that, The Cat in the Hat (2003) has a lot of sexual innuendos which is where for many it actually improves the experience, but at the end of the day, there are many other better options to show your kids.",

The cat in the hat is also a very chaotic good kinda character and Mike Myers was a perfect fit. The side stories I think was the overall problem the mainline was good and well thought out tho overall. I would like to again state good movie but feels cheap but Iconic of its times, surprising to know their budget was 109 million.",

This also annoys me because it has so many cartoonish things in a live action movie and that just makes this feel off. There is so much cringe that I could die from it! This is so bad. This is my least favorite movie. You are better off sitting on the floor motionless, silent, and bored for 1 hour and 25 minutes then watching this.

If these negative reviews are about not sticking to some old book, you all need a wake up call. It's also a family movie it's not just for kids. When I was 6 watching this the jokes just flew over my head because I was mostly watching the colors, the animation, the goo, the cupcakes and thing 1 and thing 2. Honestly, a kid doesn't think about these jokes until later when they are capable of doing most things themselves. I didn't know there were jokes like this till I was 15 and understood what I used to watch. Subliminal messages are everywhere and parents are too distracted to notice because of how it looks and how the story is perceived. But when you have a noticeably ugly cat and a unique story that \"doesn't reflect the pure books\" of course we have a problem where you only notice the jokes. Plus being a full grown adult doesn't help. Yeah this movie had more jokes than necessary but I watched this at 7 years old and I still love it today because of the nostalgia. If you coddle your kids so much they're inevitably just going to learn for themselves... and in the wrong way possibly. If you just watch these things WITH your child and actually tell them what's not okay to hear, do or say then they'll learn quicker and safer rather than finding out for themselves or overthinking what was taken away from them. This movie doesn't deserve such a poor review. It was also made in a different decade where everyone was more comfortable with stuff in entertainment. But I'm still pretty sure your child won't be scarred if they watched this movie with the family. And still positive they'll only focus on what's happening rather than what's said throughout the film. I would rate this a 3.5 or so but I'm writing 5 for the overdramatic parents.",

The live action film is much different from the timeless cartoon and the book. The reason why I'm giving the cat in the hat 1 star is because it's such a weird film and it's a different movie in general but as I said it's got some good characters. Despite the fact that there are some gross out humor and a lot of adult jokes. This is definitely an overrated film for me. I did not grow up with the film. Probably one of Mike Myers more forgotten movies. The cat in the hat is not my type of movie. It's definitely a film that I would not go back to. It's a god awful motion picture. It is not very popular as any other film from Mike Myers and Alec Baldwin. Alec Baldwin plays the villain in the film. I'm pretty sure the movie is hit or miss for a lot of people including myself.

The film is humorless, soulless, emotionless, and everythin' I wouldn't want from a retelling of this beloved Theodor Geisel story. So why make a 5-minute book into a 1-hour movie? The costumes are terrible, the set designs suck, and the CGI is overly crapass. Plus this looks like it's in a abusive Corona, California, minus the scenery. The worst thing with the Cat is that he swears like nothin' matters. The score and songs save it (plus some entertain' parts), but this is an embarrassment to Geisel and a disgusting, disrespectful film adaptation to the classic book in almost every single way possible. Don't waste your time on this if you wanna live. This \"Cat in the Hat\" deserves The Burnin' Medallion Of Badness. And one thing for this \"Cat\" (as if) here: I can hold up the cup and the milk and the cake. I can hold up the book and not watch this damn movie for god's sake!

When it was first released, I remember feeling upset that Mike Myers was cast and not Jim Carrey and that Dr. Seuss' most iconic character was being desecrated by a \"modernized\"version. However, it all seems perfectly balanced now.\n\nMyers' portrays the famous Cat as a demented rather than harmlessly goofy. Neurotic, unpredictable, and even indecent at times. He comes across as a middle-aged intoxicated or drug-addicted slightly embittered comedian.  The kids also hit both extremes, very rigid and very naughty, with a very scatter-brained mother (Kelly Preston). Alec Baldwin, as the loser boyfriend next door, shows a more light-hearted side of his normally cantankerous persona. Solid performances from all and I got the sense they all had a lot of fun on set.\n\nThe fish, who tries to get rid of the cat, has a diminished role from the book but has plenty of memorable one-liners and an extremely funny overly dramatic breakdown.\n\nI felt the narrative was mostly true to the book and the Seuss style of rhyming and timing. The scenery is perma-bright, maintaining a \"cartoon-y\" look while being very visceral. \n\nI think the movie fell flat at the box office because of timing. If it had been released more recently or perhaps as part of a Dr. Seuss multi-movie tribute, it may have done better. Unlike The Grinch which has undergone numerous 21st revisions, The Cat in the Hat was a one-off and no one has dared to touch it since.\n\nThe movie is very enjoyable, addressing single-motherhood in a carefree way while unintentionally predicting an era of excessive use of hand sanitizer and cleanliness. The VFX offers some really vivid scenes as the mayhem increases with Thing 1 and Thing 2, all culminating in a pleasant \"moral of the story.\" \n\nSo if you hated this movie at first, give it another try. It can't hurt if you do so please don't ask why.",

There are a lot of innuendos but I really dont see it as a problem, for kids, I only pick up on them rewatching as an adult. For example, when asked where he came from he saying \"When a mommy cat and a daddy cat love each other very much...\" and stops there alluding to \"the talk\" older kids get but as a child I knew that mums and dads had babies, I didn't know how but just knowing parents had babies was enough for me to understand the line without questioning it.\n\n And when he says \"Son of a ...\" and is cut off by a technical difficulties screen I was like 'Oh he must've said a swear word'. I didnt know what swear word and it didnt make much difference, I'd seen things with swearing bleeped out on TV, I knew swearing existed and if your kid does know what he was gonna say then they already know the swear word and hopefully you've already taught them not to say it. It's the same when he spells the sh** by saying \"Super Hydrolic Instantaneous Transporter\" quickly then moving on quickly, kids just dont put that together in the time its said, especially since they wont understand some of the words and will be more confused by that. \n\nAlthough, I have to admit I never understood as a child why the cat was talking to a dirty garden ho as if it was his girlfriend but when I asked my mum she always just said dont worry and that was that. It's the one bit that I think is a bit too much.\n\nBasically all in all, a great movie and I just wanted to defend it as someone who grew up watching it and didnt end up going around swearing and flirting with garden tools and didnt understand any of the innuendos and still enjoyed the movie and now I understand the jokes and enjoy the movie still.\n\nIn summary, if your kids dont get the jokes then theres no harm done and of you kids do get the jokes then you've already exposed them to that sort of thing and they're not learning anything new so no harm done.",

            "content": "Decent watch, might watch again, and can recommend, but more for older audiences.\n\nWhile \"The Cat in the Hat\" is a famous children's book, this is clearly just aimed at the folks that might have read it when they were children.  That mixes the nostalgia factor with the slew of adult oriented jokes (like infomercials) and the unnecessary addition of mother being single and dating.  Kids aren't going to find humor in those situations.\n\nThe material that is closer to the original book is much more charming and I imagine that kids will relate to it more as the kids are much more involved, or even the focus of the scenes.\n\nThe Cat in the Hat, even though he is the title character, is a support character to the two kids, played by Dakota Fanning and Spencer Breslin, who both do all they can with the writing to balance out Mike Myers as the Cat.  I don't feel like Mike Myers understands the idea of being a supporting character: he gives me a very Tom Cruise / Jimmy Fallon vibe where if there was a pause, then would just center himself in the camera and do something to draw attention.  \"Oh yeah!\" is a good example for this movie, a repeated, unnecessary line that doesn't once help the scene let alone the movie.\n\nOne would think after Jim Carey's \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\"  (2000) there would be a formula for how to adapt Dr. Seuss books (20 pages) to full length feature films, and someone clearly figured it out later in \"The Lorax\" (2012) and \"The Grinch\" (2018), so I'm....gonna blame Mike Myers.\n\nHim aside, the movie has a lot of charm to it, and Alec Baldwin manages to work an unnecessary part to at least be a believable antagonist, though the best acting in the world can't make a bad part good.\n\nIf you're just really into Dr. Seuss, then give it a watch, but you're not going to miss anything special if you skip it.",

            "content": "The Cat in the Hat was directed by the very talented production designer, Bo Welch. He put on a real over the top, off-key flick, taking on the beloved story The Cat in the Hat, originated by Dr. Seuss. Welch gets a lot of understandable hate for this film, but I think it gets more hate than it deserves. It's safe to say that Cat in the Hat did have potential to be at least par, with decent narration, story telling & some jokes, but with everything being very overcompensated & cringey, the outcome was pretty messy.\n\nDakota Fanning & Spencer Breslin seemed to have a tough time sharing the spolight, having below par performances. They had a handful of okay monents, but their character development was so simple and boring, that at the end of the film, their characters were just flat out annoying. The Cat in my bold opinion was the best part of the film. I don't really know anyone else who would nail this role.... again, idk who would want to play the role, other than maybe Johnny Depp. His jokes were really 50/50, but when they landed, they hit decently almost everytime. If you're a natural fan of Mike Myers, you can almost already imagine what you would be in for. Alec Baldwin is a real talented actor with a great reputation, but I have no clue as to what made him sign for this movie. His character is so laughably bad. As for the Fish and Thing 1 & Thing 2, they were fun additions, but nothing more than plot devices to keep the movie going at it's fast pace.\n\nThe script is really just one big ball of hit or miss jokes, that doesn't hold any weight whatsoever, with very little charm & wit. If you enjoy Mike Myers, his charisma is just oozing all over this movie. If you can't embrace it from the start, you're going to be in for a rough time.\n\nThe production design was real fun & colorful; it looked like they took pages right out of the book, and put them into frame. With a big budget, they could've gone bigger, but the setting & set pieces was a big plus for this film. \n\nSurprisingly, I enjoyed the creative songs throughout the film. They had this fun flow with catchy rhymes.",

The main ones are beyond cheesy,but actually frightening. DON'T YOU GET ME STARTED ON THE CAT AND THING 1 AND 2!! Is this Dead By Daylight made into a movie (I have never played it,but I know it's a great game and I love horror games)?! Just go and torture yourself by having to stare at an image of Jar Jar Binks for 24 hours instead of watching this! I watched this as a kid and loved it and then like about maybe a mid or quarter decade later,I can see all of the flaws in this movie. This is only for little children who always watches that kind of stuff,especially movies that kind of induces a bad influence like this one. Mainly with all the messes and stuff can lead to a bad influence. And I also managed to get some good laughs at the adult jokes (because I am old enough and don't have any siblings),but I still think that they shouldn't be in a kid's movie. The scene were his hat springs up when looking at a picture of their mom,that is like A FRICKING ERECTION REFERENCE! Part of the actual adult jokes,like half makes me laugh and half makes me worry for the kids watching it. Probably the most inappropriate one out of the whole movie is when he says, \"When a mommy cat and a daddy cat love each other very much,they decide-\". Do you even know how close he was to saying what I know he was gonna say? Younger kids aren't gonna understand a lot of it,but still. DO NOT WATCH THIS IN QUARANTINE!!! GREEN LANTERN,CATS AND THE EMOJI MOVIE WERE BETTER THAN THIS.THIS MOVIE IS LIKE 10x AS BAD. I ONLY WANTED TO WATCH IT AGAIN BECAUSE OF MIKE MYERS,BUT IT WAS A FRICKING MISTAKE!!!

As a film adaptation that strays VERY far from the book or instead, as a parody of its source material. Whilst I see it as the latter, I gave it 1 and a half stars anyway because this movie wasn't meant to be a parody. Had they officially claimed it spoofed the Dr. Seuss book, the movie would've garnered positive reviews. But, sadly, we're stuck with this adaptation that was hated by so many, Seuss' widow forbid Hollywood from ever making another live-action Dr. Seuss movie. The visuals are nice, I laughed a few times and the there is a nice light-hearted score at the beginning during its Seussian opening logos. However, since the movie is full of adult humour, it makes this movie inappropriate for children. Mike Myers' makeup as the titular character makes him look scary: either a pedophile or a poor man's Pennywise. And then, there are the Things. Since the filmmakers attempted to make them look like their book counterparts, they come off as hideous. Just because adult jokes in a kids' movie worked with Myers' previous movie Shrek, doesn't mean it's gonna apply to this one as well. It's a miracle that the careers of nearly all the actors in this movie survived. I'd conclude this review with a Seussian rhyme, which the movie does in an attempt to distract from its own disrespect towards the source material, but I'm terrible at rhyming so I'll just advise you to stick with the Grinch instead. At least the makeup was meant to look terrifying.",

The scenes are well put together and make sense. Every line means something and there is no throw away dialogue. You have to pay attention to the hidden meaning behind each word because of the double entendres that the Cat throws at you in each line.

Yes I know it got bad reviews but it's still a really good movie to watch and it's entertaining and I still watch this all the time. Mike Myers is a cool Cat In The Hat, Dakota Fanning is a cute Sally, Spencer Breslin is a great Conrad. The whole cast in this movie is great. If this is not your favorite live action Dr. Seuss film that's fine. Because it's just another version. This was never meant to replace the TV special. The live action version is just a different take on. This one talks about the characters of Sally and Conrad that were in the book and TV special that go on the adventures with The Cat and learning how to get along with each other. Also in the end of the movie they did share the blame and they both learned a lesion and it is a good character development for Sally and Conrad. The TV special will always be a classic that would make people laugh. But the live action version also makes people laugh. Can we all just get along. I mean that is what enjoying movies is all about. Enjoying both of them in different ways. I think I know why some people don't like this live action Cat In The Hat movie because it's kind of ripping off a movie that Mike Myers has been into before this movie. Like the Austin Powers movie series and it can be very hard for the viewers to understand whats going on and remember every little thing that's happening in the movie. So I don't blame this movie for being a bad one. I love how funny the movie is. This movie comes off as a really good Mike Myers flick and they took some of the best stuff from the Austin Powers movie series and create their own spin on things to extend the running time of the movie without going to far. Even though this live action Dr. Seuss movie is ripping off the Austin Powers movie series it's got a little twist to it. But it's still funny.  Not only that there is no bad words in this movie. Like the live action Grinch movie this is comedy also done right. The critics are wrong about this movie. I don't listen to them of what they have to say about this movie. I just watch the movie and what my thoughts are on the movie to see if I like it or not. For me I like this movie. It's confusing why some people don't. I really don't know why some people don't like this live action remake of The Cat In The Hat. Some people prefer the live action Grinch movie. For me that's just wrong. I love both of theses live action Dr. Seuss films. But hey if we all hate the same thing then life would be boring. Just like Jim Carrey in the live action Grinch movie Mike Myers as The Cat In The Hat can be funny too. Also Alec Baldwin's performance as Larry Quinn is what made this movie for me. He really steals the show as the main antagonist who is a child hatting jellies lover of a signal Mom trying to marry Joan for her wealth and get rid of her son Conrad by sending him to military school. Not only that he is also a Slob, a lier and a dog knaper. And of cores the coolest villain defeat of what Larry got deserved in movie history. Larry got covered in purple slime in the end of the movie. Such a great thing they did. But over all I think this a good film because when I was a kid the live action Grinch movie was my first live action Dr. Seuss movie that I saw on DVD and the live action Cat in the Hat movie was my second and I grew up with this movie and I have a different opinion it and both of theses live action Dr. Seuss movies are both entertaining and funny. Plus the 2003 movie Cat In The Hat is another live action Dr. Seuss adaptation that's a classic. Although there are some kids from the 1970's that saw the TV special and they think that is way more better than the Mike Myers Cat In The Hat movie you should find time to see them both. They are both worth watching and I can recommend to everyone who loves The Cat In The Hat. Rather if it's in cartoon animation or live action. \nI hope Universal Pictures will do a live action sequel based off the original sequel The Cat In The Hat Comes Back someday in the future. Since Audrey Geisel died in 2018 there is still hope for a live action sequel. I got an idea for The Cat In The Hat Comes Back live action remake. How about they would make it like Mary Poppins Returns but with a little twist to it. Because the two child stars Dakota Fanning and Spencer Breslin who played Sally and Conrad who are now in their 20s and 30s and Kelly Preston who played their Mom died last year. Alec Baldwin who played Larry is still alive and Mike Myers who played The Cat In The Hat is still alive too. So maybe Larry will come back to the Walden house to get his revenge on Sally and Conrad where Conrad is now married with kids of his own and Sally became an Aunt to Conrad's kids and The Cat will come back to help the family. By the way, I think I know why Audrey Geisel forbidden any future live action movies on Ted's work because in the live action Cat In The Hat movie with all the subplots, the adult humor and the rip off the Austin Powers movie series. You can tell that they are running out of ideas for future live action Dr. Seuss adaptations. The Live Action Cat In The Hat movie was a good way to end the live action Dr. Seuss adaptations. Or is it? But who knows when they are going to do another live action Dr. Seuss adaptation. When The Cat In The Hat Comes Back Live Action Remake dose come down the line in the movie making business I bet they will bring back the 2003 cast and do a better job than they did with the first movie. It's been a very long time since the 2003 movie was released and it's about time they would do a sequel. When the live action Cat In The Hat movie get's it's 20th anniversary in 2023 then The Cat In The Hat Comes Back Live Action Remake will happen.",

A comedy with adult humor intended for kids? A match made in heaven. It's rude, stupid, yet kind of hilarious as a part of the entertainment. But, this is just where we have stopped here. Yet, nowadays, there are many films especially Dr. Seuss adaptation movie with the same fate. Just get out of here!",

Every scene with thing one and two made me want to go and cry in my room, yet I still had my eyes on the tv screen. Without Mike Myers as the roll of the cat this movie wouldn't have been even half as enjoyable as it is now. The jokes he made weren't necessarily funny but made me crack up from the way he presented them. The child acting could have been so much better but they did their best. Overall this is a cheesy, awful but   good, the characters are extremely hate able, but it's fun to watch and will make you laugh quite a bit.",

The acting was possibly the worst executed I have ever seen in a film, the scripting is altogether mashed together. Think about the plot for a minute. \"Oh dear, the house is dirty! SAVE US!!\" Then there's Conrad, who's a poorly written, generally unlikeable character, snottily saying the cliched, \"I'm not going to military school!\" The boss at the very beginning of the film is so unrealistically annoying, he makes is own echo as the mom thinks of him  saying, \"You're fired\", another clich\u00e9 constantly repeated throughout the film. All of this is before we are introduced to the Cat. After seemingly every line, he either says \"OH YEAH!!\" or flails his hands around doing a little giggle. He seems to be on marijuana during every scene. This movie physically damaged my eyes, mind, and lucky streak of not seeing this movie. I had already known in advance how awful this movie would be, so I made a pledge not to watch it under my own free will. If you want a bad time, permanent brain damage and minor PTSD, I strongly encourage you to watch this movie. Or you could be sensible and watch something else.",
