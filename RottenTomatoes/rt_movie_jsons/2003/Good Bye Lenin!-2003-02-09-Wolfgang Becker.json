    "summary": "In October 1989, right before the fall of the Berlin Wall, Alex Kerner (Daniel Br\u00fchl) is living with his mom, Christiane (Kathrin Sass), and sister, Ariane (Maria Simon). But when the mother, a loyal party member, sees Alex participating in an anti-communist rally, she falls into a coma and misses the revolution. After she wakes, doctors say any jarring event could make her have a heart attack, meaning the family must go to great lengths to pretend communism still reigns in Berlin.",

            "content": "While in a coma after suffering a heart attack, Christiane (Katrin Sass), a staunch supporter of the East German communist regime, misses the fall of the Berlin Wall and the arrival of capitalism in East Berlin.  When she suddenly emerges from her coma, her son Alex (Daniel Bruhl) is forced to deceive her into believing that all is as it was before her illness in order to protect her from shock and a reoccurrence of her heart problems.  While it sometimes plays like an extended sit-com and the ruse eventually feels like it's starting to wear thin, Wolfgang Becker's Good Bye, Lenin! is filled with light humor, poignant drama, and enough good intentions to keep things interesting, as implausible as it all may be.",

I enjoyed it then and thought recently that I would like to revisit it. \n\nIt's based on the nutty premise that a son, Alex, needs to do anything he can to protect his mother from the knowledge that East Germany has fallen. Silly as that notion is, however, it's an entertaining film with likable characters, including the father and ex-husband. And the ex-astronaut taxi driver is a nice little addition.",

            "content": "The irony in Daniel Br\u00fchl's major international debut coming as a character attempting to preserve the shadow of communism while he has become far more recognizable in later years for his appearances in the MCU, possibly the most capitalist film franchise from the most capitalist media company that exists.\n\nLacking the particular experience of the fall of the Berlin Wall or even the memory of the ideological conflicts that formed the undercurrent of 20th century politics, Good Bye Lenin! probably doesn't ring as poignantly funny as it does to someone tied more closely to the events in question. But as a family dramedy with a sense of longing for a generic, lost way of life, there's plenty to like in this film, particularly the sense of devotion and love that stays secure throughout the more unsure times that the characters live through (and as I type this, Russia has announced an invasion of Ukraine in some abortive attempt to reclaim Soviet glory through the bombing of cities of a sovereign nation, so there was a particular dark perspective that this viewing was imbued with). The comedy probably takes the same premise around the block one too many times, but the concept is still a winning one, sifting through trash for an East German-branded pickle jar to prevent a shock that may cause the death of our main character's recently comatose mother. Tying in the family highs and lows intimately with a national identity gives the film a surprising amount of heft to what could have been a purely comedic premise in other hands, to the point where you will likely find yourself surprisingly emotionally invested in the outcome of the story. \n\nThe comedy-drama is an intensely difficult genre to get right, but Good Bye Lenin!, despite perhaps a bit of excess length, largely succeeds. (3/5)",

This is a charming German comedy-drama about the fall of Communism in East Germany in the late 1980's, and it's also a comment on capitalism and it's one which makes you think about commercialism as well. In October 1989, Alex Kerner (Daniel Br\u00fchl), his sister Ariane (Maria Simon) and his mother, Christiane (Katrin Sa\u00df), live in a small apartment in East Berline. Christiane is a staunch supporter of communism, and a member of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. When Alex is arrested during an anti-government march, Christiane witnesses this and she has a massive heart attack. As a result, she's in a coma for 8 months, and she misses the fall of communism and the reunification of Germany. The doctors warn Alex that the shock of the news may kill her, so Alex tries to recreate East Germany for the benefit of this mother, all in their apartment. It's a very peculiar idea, but it works, and while the scheme of our central characters might be insane, there is some method to the madness. Some of the recreations done in the film are quite funny, and so are the excuses. It's a true one off, but it puts forwards a better case for communism than capitalism.",

His father fled to the West in 1978, apparently abandoning the family. In his absence, Christiane has become an ardent idealist and supporter of the ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany (the Party). Alex takes part in an an anti-government demonstration, where he meets a girl by chance, but they are separated by the riot police before they could properly introduce themselves. When Christiane sees Alex being arrested, she suffers a near-fatal heart attack and falls into a coma. The police ignore Alexander's plea to assist his mother, instead releasing him later that evening to go and see her. While visiting his mother at the hospital, Alex again meets the girl from the demonstration, who is revealed to be Lara (Chulpan Khamatova), a young nurse from the Soviet Union taking care of his mother. Alex becomes smitten with her and asks her out. The two soon begin dating and develop a close bond. Shortly afterward, the Berlin Wall falls. In that time, capitalism comes to East Berlin, and Alex loses his job before \"winning\" a new position in a lottery to install satellite dishes with West Berlin resident Denis Domaschke (Florian Lukas), an aspiring filmmaker with whom Alex quickly becomes good friends, while Ariane leaves university to work at a Burger King drive-through. After eight months, Christiane awakes, but is severely weakened both physically and mentally. Her doctor asserts that any shock might cause another, possibly fatal, heart attack. Alex realises that the discovery of recent events would be too much for her to bear, and so sets out to maintain the illusion that things are as before in the German Democratic Republic...\n\nThis is a humorous, but yet dramatic and as well tragic look upon the fall of DDR in 1989. But, \"Goodbye Lenin\" is as well about the love to your parents and vice versa. The wish to do anything to protect a loved one from \"evil\" means in life. As I have recently visited Berlin and the DDR museum, the whole ideology of the DDR seems to have been made up, but unfortunately it was not. The life of East Berlin must have been such a traumatic experience in so many ways both before and after the wall came down. It\u00b4s strange to think about the wall today and the fall. I remember it vividly, but I reckon I had not proper understanding of what that meant back then and the oppression of the people in DDR. \"Goodbye Lenin\" is a historic document with a playfulness of the serious topic, but yet it manages to keep the balance. I liked particularly the beautiful Chulpan Khamatova as Lara.",

It's both funny and moving when we saw how Alex was trying really hard to hide the fact that Germany had reunified; from searching for an old GDR brand of pickles to creating a fake TV shows.

Essentially it's a love story between a woman for her country and a son for his mom, using the extinction of East Germany in 1989-90 as its setting and rationale. Lies play an important part in this tale, however, depicted in a way to make us realize that spoken lies and  silent lies are often necessary to make love survive.",

            "content": "Directors Lars von Trier from Denmark, Pedro Almodovar from Spain, Michael Haneke from Germany, Guillermo del Toro from Mexico and most recently Tomas Alfredson from Sweden are a handful of director's from across the globe that have cemented a fervent following worldwide. These are a notable bunch (and there are many others), so why is it then, that after this little gem of a film from 2003 that German director Wolfgang Becker hasn't made more of name for himself? If this film is anything to go by, he certainly deserves more recognition.\n In 1989, East German teenager Alex (Daniel Bruhl) feels liberated when the Berlin Wall comes down. His mother, however, is a staunch Communist, who would balk at the thought of westernisation. Just before the collapse of the wall, she has a heart attack and falls into a coma. When she awakens 8 month later and Germany now reunited as a country,  Alex along with his older sister are advised by doctors to protect her fragile condition from any form of stress. As a result, they fabricate news bulletins and information to dupe their recuperating mother into believing German reunification never actually happened.\n With a music score by Yann Tiersen, who done the wonderful soundtrack to the 2001 French film \"Amelie\", you'd be forgiven for having similar feelings to that film while watching this. It's not just the music that they have in common though. They also share an inventive and highly original approach. This may not contain the fantasy elements of \"Amelie\" but it's delivered with such an offbeat creativity that it could hold it's own against (another notable director) Jean-Pierre Juenet's aforementioned delight. It has a great mix of humour and pathos with scenes of such tragic sadness combined with a wonderful lightness of touch and sharp observational humour. Despite the title of the film and the political setting of the story, this is essentially a coming-of-tale and less of a commentary on the demise of communism in East Germany. The fall of the Berlin wall serves only as a backdrop to the maturing of the young protagonist. So as not to ostracise his audience writer/director Becker wisely and cleverly, doesn't side with either East German communism or West German capitalism but instead, skilfully crafts a bittersweet satire and nostalgic tale of life from both sides of the country. He's also helped immeasurably by two emotionally understated performances from his lead actors; Daniel Bruhl and Katrin Saas.\n I was aware of this film when it was released but it should never have taken me as long as it has to get around to viewing it. Now, I'm just glad and hope that others don't make the same mistake of ignoring this profound and poignant pleasure.",

            "content": "I was quite weary before watching this film as I haven't been that familiar with the history of German division aside from the fall of Berlin Wall and well, Reagan's famous 'tear down this wall' speech. But \"Good Bye, Lenin!\", with a narrator (that's also the film's protagonist) that seem far too poetic at times but ultimately convincing, delivered the necessary information with a tone of mundane deliberateness to highlight the character's naturalism for audiences to follow the film's political background closely . \n\nIt's as if there's a far more important theme to tackle other than socialist intricacies. But of course, there is: An enduring story of a son's love to his mother devoid of any conditionals. \n\nAfter his socialist mother (Katrin Sass in an impressive performance) has awakened from an 8-month comma due to a heart attack, Alex (played by Daniel Bruhl, whom you may recognize as Frederick Zoller in the later Tarantino film \"Inglourious Basterds\"), who have learned from the doctor that his mother shouldn't be shocked or hooked into excitement in any way whatsoever as it may result to complications, is eager to keep her home. But complications is never just a health dilemma. The Berlin Wall has fallen. It's now one Germany, and the stocks of Spreewald gherkins has cruised into scarcity. Her mother's reality has turned into a unified land filled with alien capitalism.\n\nHe faced the situation with a calm demeanor and absurdist resolute, and helped by his friend and aspirant filmmaker Denis (Florian Lukas, who's like a cross between Robert Carlyle and a younger Ed Harris), decided to re-create GDR in ingenious kinds of ways as to prevent her mother from having the heart-thumping revelation of her life. A well-intended deception heightened by comedy. A 'comedy' that surely roots out from social idealism (the mother) suppressed by empirical determination. \n\nDirector Wolfgang Becker directed these sequences with uncommon energy and quirks that the first hour of the film flowed so effortlessly with quick pace, ease and story-telling delight. Yet from those elements mainly conceived from clever concepts and scenarios, \"Good Bye, Lenin!\" is still focused in its human drama. \n\nIt's less a politically-toned film than it is a penetrating study of connection (Alex's family), re-connection (the father sub-plot) and disconnection (from A horrid emotional past and the attachment to the GDR). Of course, from the point of view of a German who have experienced the social atmosphere of East/West Germany, \"Good Bye, Lenin!\" is mainly affecting due to the countless nostalgic references to olden times and the euphoric destruction of separatist sentiments. But from those way outside looking in (like me), what's very special with this film is its balance of happiness and melancholy by way of how it highlights the fun of liberty and the anguish of mistakes. \n\n\"Good Bye, Lenin!\" is very eloquent on all sides, capturing the essential 'celebratory' mood of reunified Germany and the irony of the countless ruins and how it tries to accommodate its reverberated surroundings in desperate vain, especially how the wrecked Lenin statue hanging below a helicopter seems to communicate something to Alex's mother (one of the many great scenes in the film) as if asking for forgiveness or asking for her hand and saying, 'my child, my deeply socialist child, come with me'. \n\nFrom its shifting pace to comic moments and times of tears, \"Good Bye, Lenin!\" has been strongly consistent with the entirety of its delivery and it has rendered a political reverie-turned reality into a convincing world of varied emotions and where euphemistic acceptance is a possibility. And moreover, departing from the complexities, the film is, simply put, a lasting love letter to all mothers who have loved their children unlike any other.",

I love how the relationships between the various characters is depicted and how Germany changed between those two periods.\n\nThis movie is a jewel, the actors are perfect, the music is awesome, the story is great and the feeling this movie give you is simply heart-warming.\nI definitely recommend it and consider it as the best movie I ever saw.",

Alexander Kerner joined a political rally for a free press. Beaten up and arrested by police thugs, his socialist mother sees all of this happening right before her eyes and has a heart attack in the middle of the street. For eight month, she is in a coma. Her doctor has given her a bleak diagnosis. During those eight months, the Berlin wall fell. Capitalism triumphed and the Leninist-Bolshevik perversion of socialism finally fell into the scrap heap while she was in a coma. When she finally wakes up, her doctor, Dr. Wagner, sits Alex and his sister Ariane down for a talk, telling them that any level of excitement could cause her to have another coma and possibly even death. Knowledge of her beloved socialism failing and capitalist triumph in Germany would surely cause her to have another heart attack. Alex rushes his mother back to their apartment and tears down anything which has to do with capitalism and only puts stuff up which is socialist in nature: portraits of Che Guevara hang on the wall. Books authored by Lenin are on the bookshelf. And he uses deception on a grand and comedic scale, hiring his tech savvy X-TV co-worker Dennis Domasckhu to creat fake news broadcasts for her to watch on the TV. He would take the labels off the capitalist products and proceed to tape over it with vestiges of the socialist ones, such as Spreewald Pickles, Mocha Fix, and Globus Green peas. But two funny and very memorable scense stick out to mind. One scene is where the mother Christiane gets out of bed to play with her granddaughter Paula and proceeds to leave the apartment. She walks onto the streets to find merchandise which are clearly symbols of capitalism. Hot pink lamps. Cars being sold on the car lot. And a helicopter taking away a recently broken statue of Vladimir Lenin. That scene was hilarious! Another memorable scene was the final and fake newscast which was Alexander and Dennis's finest hour. In this newscast, Erich Honecker had resigned as General Secretary of the Communist Party and was to be replaced by Cosmonaut Sigmnund Jahn. Jahn was a highly decorated cosmonaut in Socialst Germany but under capitalism, he was reduced to driving a cab. So in an ingenious move, Alexander hires Jahn for one final news deception. He gives a speech as he is promoted to the post of General Secretary and promises to make life better for all Germans under Socialism.",

            "content": "\"On the evening of 7th October, 1989 several hundred people got together for some evening exercise and marched for the right to go for walks without the Berlin Wall getting in their way.\" The German-language film Good Bye, Lenin! is a story of several aspects: A son's love for his mother, a family torn apart by the Iron Curtain, set against the collapse of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) in 1989. In 1978, Alex Kerner's father seemingly abandons his wife and children living in East Berlin, and flees to the West. Alex's mother, Christiane, in a form of emotional withdrawal, decides to dedicate herself to furthering the socialist ideals of the GDR, becoming effectively a model citizen. Jump ahead to October 1989, where Alex's mother has a heart attack and falls into a coma after witnessing him being arrested during a demonstration. Alex is told that any further stress may kill her. Whilst she is unconscious however, the Berlin Wall falls and the country his mother dedicated the past decade of her life to serving effectively disappears overnight. Thus, when she wakens in 1990, to prevent her dying from the shock, Alex attempts to pretend that the GDR as she knew it still exists, and goes to considerable lengths to keep the truth from her. He fakes the existence of East German foods which were no longer made, shows her reruns of old news programmes and even celebrates Christiane's birthday in the typical socialist style. The acting in this endearing, funny and poignant film is superb, and it really is a shame that so few in the English-speaking world have had the bravery to see it. Daniel Bruhl is very convincing as in the main role, lending a youthful and defiant attitude, and the rest of the cast provide the perfect backdrop. The humour is also a mixture of satire and farce, with many hilarious but also provoking scenes, such as the solumn changing of the East Berlin guard outside the Neue Wache, whilst a column of Coca-Cola trucks roll past down Unter den Linden. Alex and his West Berlin friend Denis also recreate a number of East German news reports for Christiane, presenting a counterfactual alternative history where the people in the West flooded into East Germany, rather than vice versa. There is also an excellent soundtrack throughout, alternatively dramatic and sombre, which helps to set the mood. In the end, Good Bye, Lenin! expresses a kind of sad nostalgia (known in Germany as Ostalgie) for an GDR that no longer exists, in fact and never existed. The regime often brutally surpressed its citizens, as this film demonstrates, and yet many were willing to believe in the socialist ideals it claimed to serve. As history is apt to remind us, neither socialism nor indeed capitalism hold all the answers to life's problems.",

That's not a bad thing per se, it's just that they can be very very different.  I'm of the opinion that Germans were collectively dropped on their heads where humor is concerned.  Not that they don't find things funny, but when we try to see the humor that they're laughing so loudly about we end up scratching our heads and walking away muttering things about Aryans and racial purity gone awry.  This film made me think that if I had been born in Germany, I would want to travel somewhere and have my funny bone seen about.\nHaving said all that, this movie has moments that make up for the tedious parts.  I gave the film 4 stars, but I'm probably being overly generous due to the fact that I owe happenstance one for making me American.  At the end, you see something that you didn't expect to see; a very tender moment as Alex's mother sees what Alex has done but chooses to go to her grave before letting on to him that she's seen through his ruse.  And in Alex, so well portrayed by Daniel Bruhl, you see the love that compelled him to create such a labyrinthine program of deception to keep his mother from having another heart attack while preserving her dignity.\nThis isn't the shortest film nor is it the easiest one for someone accustomed to the rapid fire scene changes that predominate today.  But if you take the time to watch it, and have it in mind that you might just be entertained by it, you'll find a great little film with heart.",
