    "summary": "In this musical, college student Justin (Justin Guarini) arrives in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., for spring break with his friends Brandon (Greg Siff) and Eddie (Brian Dietzen), and quickly crosses paths with waitress Kelly (Kelly Clarkson). Although Justin falls for Kelly almost instantly, Kelly's jealous friend, Alexa (Katherine Bailess), tries her best to keep the two apart. With the help of several song-and-dance numbers, however, Justin and Kelly eventually connect and make sweet music together.",

            "content": "This movie is a box office fail, and a complete flop, but I will have to say I love the music and I love the dancing. I think Justin delivers a corny, ridiculous character that definitely should have been rewritten, but Kelly gives you the fun and exciting character, that you actually enjoy. I think if the love interest and the storyline was a little twisted, and gave you a better script I think kelley participating in the film would've been a box office success, but I think Justin was the wrong choice to move forward. They should have done something with Kelly only an allowed her the opportunity to succeed. But she didn't need it because she is a megastar to this day.",

Justin Guarini and Kelly Clarkson are in a romantic musical jut by the idea of that it sounds like a terrible film.\nA lonely, sexually repressed man. A depressed woman. A summer camp. On this fateful night, they will meet... and their hearts will become one.\nThe films goal was probably to make some money and make their careers hot on the press, maybe at the time it may have succeeded but this is one lame romantic musical, with the music looking like a music video instead of a heartfelt hollywood production. The acting is downright awful and I had to check periodically to find out if I had gone death just by listening to their dialogue. The story is no interesting its the same things you see in any teen romance but with unlikeable characters and your not rooting for the two main leads to be together.\nThe direction is horrendous this time around from Robert Iscove who directed She's All That which I have plans on seeing in this time of love as we're closing in on Valentines Day.\nNone of the elements of a good film are present during this picture it has horrible script with horrendous acting and just a really boring premise and love story. I'm giving From Justin To Kelly a half out of five.",

            "content": "If there is a movie that I made through without changing the channel, From Justin to Kelly is that movie.\n\nWhen Kelly (Clarkson) and Justin (Guarini) embark on a vacation in search of some fun in the sun with their respective groups of friends, the two meet and fall for each other at first sight. Unfortunately, a series of comedic mishaps and hijinks gets in the way of them getting together. Several song-and-dance numbers ensue.\n\nFrom Justin to Kelly is one big commercial for Kelly Clarkson (who is the winner of season one of American Idol) and Justin Guarini (who is the runner-up of season one of American Idol). Sometimes that is not a terrible thing but in case of this film, it is. For them to be singers to be in a movie like this together as a whole, they must have chemistry. In the case of From Justin to Kelly,saying Clarkson and Guarini's is nonexistent is an insult to any two leads with missing chemistry with each other.\n\nThe story is really idiotic and paint-by-numbers. I have seen this done before. Our characters (and I use that word loosely) get together then they break up for some reason and then they get back together (blah blah blah). We get it! Try something new, please. Oh, I forgot! The producer and writer of Spice World directed this film. Let that sink in for a second!\n\nThe two things that should have been good is the songs and choreography. And boy, they are a letdown. The songs in From Justin to Kelly are some of the most banal songs in recent memory. They are not enjoyable to listen to. The songs are dull and unlistenable. And the choreography is the worst I have ever seen. It is so bad that the film won the Governor's Award at the Razzies.\n\nThere is one thing good about From Justin to Kelly. That is the voice of Anika Noni Rose (who later did Dreamgirls and The Princess and the Frog). And that is it. Unfortunately, her beautiful voice along with Clarkson is just wasted in a film like this.\n\nAs a notorious stinker, from the flat acting, the conventional plot, the boring songs, and you name it, From Justin to Kelly is a complete failure. It is a movie so bad that Clarkson felt contractually obligated to do the movie. After watching it, I totally believe her. It is a good thing that she went and did better things with her career. I questioned myself like\" Is there any point to the film besides making for Clarkson and Guarini?\" The answer to that is a no. This was an excuse for them to have their own movie after their season of American Idol was over. Don't get me wrong! There is nothing wrong that. However, if you get the writer and producer of Spice World, it can go the left really quick. And too bad it didn't work out for Clarkson and Guarini. Unless you are a teen, watch some Kelly Clarkson music videos instead or just listen to her music (which are way better). You are better off doing that.",

            "content": "Wow... This film really took me by surprise. I had such a great time watching this movie. Oh don't get me wrong, From Justin To Kelly is probably one of the worst movies ever made. But you know what? I laughed so hard and was fascinated about how bad it really is. The Acting, writing and musical numbers are just so bad that it just results in a hilarious piece of Crap. All I can say is... WOW! \n\nNow it's going to be very hard describing this plot here because really I am not sure if there really is one. It's very clumsy with no execution whatsoever. So apparently Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini play... Justin and Kelly. They are having fun with their friends on Spring Break in Miami. Somehow they feel a \"connection\" (sure whatever)  that pretty much is never fully realized because this evil Blonde gets in the way for no real reason. Yeah like I said, this movie has a plot that makes absolutely  no sense. In fact, the romance makes no sense. Any time Justin and Kelly try to be romantic I would imiidately start laughing. It's obvious Kelly Clarkson doesn't want to be in this movie and it's clear Justin is no actor. I must also point out this feels like a Rip Off to a lot of Disney movies. There's a very fast romance, comic relief characters that could easily be talking animals and an evil woman who gets a villain song. Oh but it gets even better! \n\nThe acting in this movie is just awful, we are talking \"The Room\" type of awful. No emotion is believable from anyone in this movie. I think the only person who does a decent job is Anika Noni Rose and even then that's not saying much. Still, the acting gets a big laugh from me and really that's one of the reasons why I enjoyed this movie in a \"So bad it's good\" way. \n\nThough I must say the musical numbers can get very tiring. Some of them last really long and the songs are not very good. Obviously, this movie was a promotional tool for American Idol so yeah talk about Buyer's remorse. Still, it's very fascinating how bad the musical and dance numbers are. I can't really describe it, this movie is the type of bad you only hear in fairy tales. And really that's what From Justin To Kelly is, a bad movie people like me dream about. \n\nHonestly, I don't know what else to say about this movie.  Strangely enough, I kind of recommend it. It's just one of those films that is so bad it needs to be watched. The acting is awful, the writing is horrendously awful, the musical numbers are laughable, the two leads have no chemistry and yet I had a great time watching possibly one of the worst movies ever made.",
