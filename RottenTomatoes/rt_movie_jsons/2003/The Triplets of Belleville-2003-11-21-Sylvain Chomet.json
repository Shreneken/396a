            "content": "The Triplets of Belleville teases that it's going to be much raunchier than it turns out to be — the opening scenes with older men wedged between the butt-cheeks of their voluptuous wives and those same men turning into literal animals and accosting the racist caricature of the black dancer in a banana skirt. Instead, the movie is a sweet story of a grandmother, Madame Souza (Graziella de Villa), searching for her kidnapped adult grandson, Champion (Noel Baye) with their beloved dog, Bruno. The animation style is wonderful — everyone, and I mean everyone, is grotesque. There is no shortage of protruding noses, buckteeth, bow legs, spacious foreheads, and receding hairlines. No one really speaks, either, and when they do, it's gibberish — squawking, moans & groans. This sits juxtaposed with the beautiful landscapes and cityscapes of Paris and \"Belleville,\" a mashup of Paris, NYC, Montreal, and Quebec City. Madame Souza's house begins as an isolated, oddly shaped building in the pastoral countryside literally being knocked askew by an elevated train line in and out of expanding Paris. \"Belleville\" possesses the grandeur of Art Deco Metropolis and Brazil. The story itself can't really keep up with the animation, however, and it becomes repetitive. Moreover, there's simply not enough dialogue. Just a conversation here and there with the rest of the pantomiming would've been to the movie's benefit. The Triplets of Belleville is dark, but endearing, with stylish animation and a nice, family-focused story.",

            "content": "This film is very bizarre - visually it looked quite quirky, sometimes surreal. Some scenes appear like dream sequences and I noted that some of the characters have exaggerated appearances, as if their a caricature of themselves. The animation is somewhat old fashioned perhaps, appearing like traditional 2D animation but I prefer that in some way to more CGI heavy films. Whether it was actually shot/filmed that way I don't know - there certainly are some scenes featuring CGI aspects but for the most part it looked more traditional to me in any case. I suppose the lines had a bit of a slap dash quality to them but I liked it regardless. My favourite character was the dog - a bit of a gentle giant type. There are musical moments in the film too, which I enjoyed. I'll say no more so as not to provide spoilers.\n\nWould I recommend it? yes I would.",

            "content": "The movie began by depicting said triplets as young, popular singers who were in high demand in the 1930's and played in big theaters to big audiences. Then it moves to France, shows decades passing and changes to the neighborhood, where an old woman in an apartment trains her grandson to compete in a French bicycle race. But during said race, some criminals kidnap the grandson and take him to New York City, and the grandmother hires a floating bicycle to paddle across the Atlantic Ocean to find her grandson being held by (French immigrant?) gangsters, as well as said triplets now living in poverty in a New York slum and reduced to making music using found objects.\n\nThere are moments of cleverness in this movie, but overall it is too slow-moving with too much dead space in it. Also, what is the whole point? Were things supposed to be better in the past compared to later? In France as well as the USA? (Actually, if this is supposed to be the 1950's or 1960's, obesity was less common in the USA in that era.) Or specifically the entertainment industry? This movie is better than Monty Python's \"French Subtitled Film\", but not by a whole lot.",

The plot is off-beat, about a elderly woman & her dog trying to rescue her cyclist grandson who's been kidnapped for...well, you just have to see it.  Visually, the film is a fantastic mix of old-school animated techniques & modern CGI, merging in some gorgeous sequences, from a voyage across the Atlantic to the car chase through the streets of New York.  And of course, the song the Triplets sing is instantly catchy.  A great, unique animated film that is easily one of the best in the last decade or so.",

Highly stylized with its own look (not the homogenized animation we're now getting used to) that experiments with mixed media and unusual camera angles (among other directorial flourishes).  The soundtrack, featuring 1920s era jazz plus classical plus diegetic effects (but no dialogue of any consequence) heightens your pleasure.  The plot seems to involve the mafia kidnapping some Tour de France riders and the efforts of one's grandmother (and faithful dog) to track down and rescue him in a distant city called Belleville; they are aided by a trio of ancient jazz performers (the Triplets of the title).  The result is funky and fresh and also very French.  Highly recommended.",
