The final battle is epic and intense. The film is long but the story is well written and doesn't feel like a drag to watch. Worth a watch if you enjoy Tom Cruise, war movies or are interested in Japanese history.",

It's terrifying when his military commander approaches him and Cruise offers to assassinate him for free. Freaky moment when Cruise demonstrates how to scalp someone to the translator. However, these are only a few scenes. Cruise isn't horrible during the rest of the film; it's just that outside of those three scenes, he doesn't have many lines that are really noteworthy. In addition, around the halfway point, you're probably thinking, \"Oh no, not another dull Hollywood plot,\" which is of course the case.",

I thought the performances were pretty decent and indeed I was somewhat surprised to discover Tim Spall playing Simon Graham and also Billy Connolly as Zebulon Gant - an eclectic cast for for a film set in such a foreign land, I imagine you'd agree?.\n\nThere are some cheesy/cliched aspects to it, no doubt. A number of times Cruise is shown with the typical pensive/deep in thought type look on his face, that or/and the determined expression shows up a lot, which I felt to be a little cliched, or certainly cheesy to say the least.\n\nAlso, a young child is shown talking to Nathan a number of times - I imagine many a girl/woman/lady thinking they look cute together but I question the credibility/feasibility, of him being able to speak the local mother tongue/dialect fluently for one thing. I'm not a big fan of Tom Cruise, I think its fair to say! still, that and the issues I've raised aside, I will say that the fight sequences are well filmed, with some good martial arts based fighting shown, good choreography and well shot battle scenes. I liked that there is a context shown for these fights/battles, rather than it being one long war/battle film and little else. It did feel somewhat more substantial than, I suppose, I'd expected it to be and so I'm giving it a 4 out of 5 star rating, as overall it is quite good I'd say, even if your not especially keen on Tom Cruise.",

Japanese culture has a particular appeal to me, and perhaps to many westerners, but there is something false and too poetic about the samurai's portrayal in this movie. For one, the whys of the war are never really stated clearly, only in the vague term of modernization, and so the mature and perceptive watcher will be unable to ascertain who is truly morally in the right. This can also be seen, somewhat, as a pro for the narrative, but for me its a flaw and cheapens the plot. Several parts of the plot also seem to be of bad poetic or narrative taste, which cheapen the plot as well. The movie is beautifully done though, with many great shots and stellar acting. I would say that most people would enjoy this movie on their first watch, and might find things to go back and analyze further, though I believe it will probably end somewhat fruitlessly and the immature watcher will eventually grow out of the overabundant romanticism. Not that it pervades the movie too much, but it is splashed throughout. Of course, there is something to gain from anything, however, this is no narrative masterpiece as far as I can tell, just a very boyish story of honor and blood lacking a significant reason and higher purpose. The philosopher also might find some interest in it, but he has much more time than most people.",

            "content": "This movie showcases simplicity at its finest. Everything from the exploration of the last days of the samurai to the fresh, yet grueling tale of hostmanship all play their integral role in making this film a truly riveting experience. Cruise enriches the movie with his macho charisma, but he infuses it with a sense of endearing respect for Japanese culture and the Samurai. Cruise and Watanabe show an excellent chemistry that allows each of the characters to reflect on their own way of life, whilst respecting each other's. Even though their chemistry is standout, I really felt that the tale of Watanabe's sister was very innovative. Allowing the audience to discover the differences between modern and Japanese samurai culture by tapping into the shame of aiding a loved one's killer, this was truly a well intentioned decision made by the creative team. This being a Samurai epic, one would likely expect action and the last samurai does not disappoint, utilizing the environment and the weather to provide visually engrossing story telling. And then bolstering it by using one of the best soundtracks I have ever had the pleasure of listening to. Yes, Hans Zimmer strikes again with his golden touch. His score is possibly the best thing about this movie for me. It envelopes every scene with the right emotion, whether that be pathos, dread or blood pumping action or hell, a combination of all of them. His soundtrack allows the movie to change from a fun popcorn munching comedy scene to a tense action set piece effortlessly. This man has truly mastered his craft and is yet to go wrong.\nAll this being said, the simplicity of the movie does act as a double edged sword. I just wished they dived in deeper to some of the concepts they put on display, like Seppeku, the Samurai way or the hospitality of the samurai's wife. Koyoki plays the role of Taka very well, hiding the shame behind stoic eyes, but the audience know the toll this is taking on her through her interactions and reactions within the tribe and with Captain Algren. A larger amount of dialogue and a few extra scenes really exploring these concepts would have done this movie good. All in all, great film.",

There is a bit of nudity but it isn't for too long or too serious but my class burst out laughing when there was some love connections.

A great look into the start of Imperial Japan rise to the modern era before the Japo-Russo War, WW1 & it conquistador attitude of taking over Asia during the 1920's to our involvement of WWII.",

            "content": "It's an epic film that captures Cruise in one of his best roles -- intense, reflective, and uniquely transcendent. Is the film problematic? Sure, the white savior thing can definitely leave a sour taste in your mouth, but Edward Zwick (Legends of the Fall, Blood Diamond etc) has created in this category for some time. So, once you get over that sizable hump, does the film have value? Cruise's portrayal of a lost, forlorn addict who's forced onto the Hero's journey (to care and empathize once again with his fellow man) is a crusade of memorable interactions. Most indelible are the moments of beauty -- with the young sons of the man he conquered in 1-on-1 combat, as well as the scenes in which the land itself begins to play on his consciousness. Look no further than to modern attempts at this 'spiritual' moment (Marvel's Iron Fist) to realize that the tasteful nature of Zwick's sequencing engender a cinematic experience \"close\" to that reality. It calls to mind, Tykwer's editing in the market sequences from Perfume: The Story of a Murderer -- another overlooked film. The true winner in The Last Samurai is the beauty of Japanese culture and philosophy and it's power to save Cruise. Perhaps, I'm biased, but the need to look East in order to move forward operating from the highest parts of us, may be the deeper truth portrayed here, once you get passed the white face on the marketing poster. It's a fun journey to go on, to feel and identify with the nobility and integrity of the Samurai, and in spending so much time with them in various capacities, they are captured as a well rounded people, much more than warriors or agents of destruction in some great battle scenes. This is a character drama in the shell of a historical drama, and both stories are of epic proportions. Robert Mckee would approve. But who gives a damn, it's a great ride.",

It's no secret or surprise as we all know that guy can act, he adds a great deal to his character here; especially on the emotional side of things. As for what happens with Algren, it's all good even if the love interest parts are undercooked.\n\nKen Watanabe is splendid in the role of Katsumoto, while Masato Harada (Omura) and Timothy Spall (Graham) give positive performances.

I have never liked sword fighting. Maybe, I don't get it. But I certainly do not agree to the rhythm of it. To a degree that I might even be hostile to the idea. To me, it is baffling to even suggest it. BUT. Then comes the director Edward Zwick. His picturization of that side (I am saying \"that\" for I never connected with the sword fighting) of the action with a perspective from our version of the war, the one we know, which could be the key to understand the romance between two sword fighters. And I am not saying that every decision in the film is correct.\n\nAnd I am not even remotely touching to the storyline or the emotions that is claimed as the influence to all the \"cling-clang!\" noises. Let's just stick to the action itself. The only weak point that I think was the slow motion shots. I didn't find it necessary to slow down these brilliantly choreographed, dangerously performed and sharply edited action scenes. Its rapid and short nature is what made its threats and promises and myths to be supremely fearful.\n\nWith a zap an arrow hits and a swoosh the sword swings by, and in no time your perception changes about the film. What kind of a film? How its nature is going to be? And where will this bloodshed of a war going to end? Another advantage and my brother would argue the only advantage is Tom Cruise.

The film stars Tom Cruise as Nathan Algren and Ken Watanabe as Katsumoto.\n\nThe story follows Nathan Algren a man who has been hired by the Emperor of Japan to train the country's first army in the art of modern warfare, but after the first battle is lost he is taken prisoner by the samurai for reasons unknown to him. The story I found to be very intriguing and gripping, but if I had one problem it would be that the story slowed down a little too much toward the beginning of the third act.\n\nThe acting was also very good, especially Tom Cruise as Nathan Algren, I found that he threw himself into the character and gave a really good performance.\n\nThe cinematography was also very strong and grand, with a few beautiful shots of the characters and scenery.\n\nThe sets and costumes were in my opinion one of the best aspects of the film, especially with the design and detail of the village run by Katsumoto.\n\nIf I had one kind of big problem with the film it would be that I wish the colour palette was more bright and less dull, but luckily it doesn't take away from the characters or story.\n\nThe action I found to be shot and directed really well, especially the duels in the way of the samurai. The practical effects were also very strong, especially with the explosions and stabbings. \n\nThe film also had some really strong atmosphere, especially at the end of the third act with Nathan and Katsumoto.\n\nThe film I also very much enjoyed, and I will be watching it again in the future.\n\nOver all I give it a\n8/10",

            "content": "The Last Samurai: 8 out of 10: I admit I greeted this movie with low expectations. The idea of Tom Cruise as the last Samurai was laughable. The film altogether suspended this disbelief right until the awful last scene. Tom Cruise plays a drunken Civil War hero who hired by the Japanese government to modernize their army is captured by the Samurai rebels and falls in love with their doomed way of life.\n\nAnd what a life. Every shot of the Samurai village is postcard perfect almost to the point of unintended parody. Like Robert Redford's take on Montana in \"Legends of the Fall,\" every view is spectacular, every sunset is orange, every leaf is colorful and falls just so, and all the characters are freshly scrubbed and dressed in their Sunday best. You wouldn't be half surprised to see Hobbits pop out at any moment. Of course, the old time Samurai are romanticized to the nth degree. Historically the Samurai at this point resembled Afghan warlords resisting a long overdue central government rather than the honorable colorfully armored knights that are depicted. (Samurai no more wore armor in the late 18th century than the British army did.) \n\nThe picture despite one or two faults works, the acting, with one exception is uniformly excellent. The battle scenes are plentiful and full of surprises, and the pacing is excellent. On the dark side newcomer, Nakamura Shichinosuke plays the Japanese emperor like he was channeling Michael Jackson. The voice and mannerisms of the gloved one are as out of place for a Japanese emperor than it would be for the Pope. His strangely self-effacing dialogue doesn't help his cause, yet it truly is his performance that is cringe-worthy. In addition, the last scene is an awful Hollywood copout. I still recommend The Last Samurai highly however as a thinking mans action movie.",

I became so angered when they brought out the big guns that I really saw the message that the director was putting out there. He was stating that the evil and greedy and cruel are not people who believe in fairness or justice.

There wasnt any aspect of this film that failed to impress me. The script, the music, the cast, the visuals, it was all remarkable. I had so much fun with The Last Samurai, and was emotionally locked in from the first frame. Tom Cruise was spectacular as the jaded American soldier who is sent to help fight a war in Japan. And I can finally see why the world has revered Ken Watanabe, because he was the heart and soul of this film and elevated it to another level. The battle sequences were stunning, and captured the scope and brutality of war. When they werent fighting, the beauty of Japan is also presented in awe-inspiring fashion. There were a few tiny complaints I could probably make about the film, but I ignored them most of the time because I was so invested in the characters to the point that I was brought to tears more than once. The Last Samurai accomplished what I long for most films to do: It had me so engrossed that I forgot I was watching a movie and I just experienced the magic of the story as if I were a part of it.

I started this movie not knowing what to expect, and when I was about 10 minutes in I totally forgot that the main character was Tom Cruise. Not because he is not in the movie, but because his portrayal of this main character was so interesting. He plays a drunken war hero who does not care about who he kills or why he kills them. He is only in it for the money, until he stumbles upon the Samurai culture. Then his whole outlook on life begins to change. This is a gorgeous looking movie that has great character arcs, and amazing action. I did not feel the two and a half hour run time at all, this film flew by! It is a great film that is very underrated. Please check it out on Netflix before it is taken off!",

Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwyn), his former commanding officer, approaches him with an offer. Japanese businessman Omura wishes to hire distinguished U.S. soldiers to train the Imperial Japanese Army to suppress a samurai rebellion. In exchange, Japan would grant the U.S. exclusive rights to supply arms to the Japanese army. Needing money, Algren accepts the job, despite his personal hatred of Bagley. Most of the soldiers being trained are little more than peasants and farmers. When the samurai rebels attack a railroad, Bagley orders the regiment to mobilize, despite Algren's objections. The samurai horsemen quickly slaughter the undisciplined and intimidated soldiers. Algren kills several samurai, but is knocked from his horse and eventually collapses from exhaustion. As a warrior named Hirotaro prepares to execute him, he kills Hirotaro with a flagstaff. Seeing Algren's ferocity and the white tiger on the flag he wields, rebel leader Katsumoto Moritsugu (Ken Watanabe) is reminded of a recurring dream. He spares Algren's life and takes him to the rebels' village. Under supervision, Algren explores the village and interacts with its inhabitants. He meets with Katsumoto, who converses with him for mutual understanding. Algren grows to respect the lifestyle of the samurai and their families. As time passes, he learns more of the Japanese culture and language. He learns that Katsumoto initiates the rebellion to oppose the speed westernization, and that he believes they are acting in the best interest of Japan. Algren must now choose to honor his loyalty and take sides in this act of rebellion...\n\nThe film achieved higher box office receipts in Japan than in the United States. Critical reception in Japan was generally positive. Tomomi Katsuta of The Mainichi Shinbun thought that the film was \"a vast improvement over previous American attempts to portray Japan\", noting that director Edward Zwick \"had researched Japanese history, cast well-known Japanese actors and consulted dialogue coaches to make sure he didn't confuse the casual and formal categories of Japanese speech.\" However, Katsuta still found fault with the film's idealistic, \"storybook\" portrayal of the samurai, stating: \"Our image of samurai is that they were more corrupt.\" As such, he said, the noble samurai leader Katsumoto \"set (his) teeth on edge.\" In the United States, critic Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, saying it was \"beautifully designed, intelligently written, acted with conviction, it's an uncommonly thoughtful epic.\" Edward Zwick is a skillful director in terms of epic historical costume dramas, and here he has beautiful environments, big scale fighting scenes, an intriguing storyline that does carry connections to Kevin Costner´s \"Dances with Wolves\" and solid actors in the main roles. In general it´s exciting, thought provoking, touching and the cultural differences between West and East has a great foundation for a story. However, the movie ends up quite quickly in the land of predictability and it becomes one long wait to reach the end you know all so well before you even have seen it. It´s a shame as I do like the foundation of the story, but the execution and development of the story on the screen becomes not as good as it could´ve been as a deeper substance is lacking from it.",

There's a lot of Anachronistic elements at play that really tries to sell the drama of underdog honor bound fighters versus superior brutal government forces. I always compare the ninja sequence to having a full plate french knight brain someone in the middle of a world war 1 movie for historical accuracy.\n\nIn reality both the Shogunate and Meiji used guns and actually swapped reasons for fighting (where the Meiji initially wanted to oust foreign influence), then the conflict turned into a more general previous ruling Shogunate versus the Emperor (with Saigo Takamori actually starting a mini rebellion later despite helping the Meiji).\n\nIn short the time period was incredibly complex which the Last Samurai ignores for a more simplistic almost romantic fairytale approach. Especially with the inserted American adviser over say a more accurate French adviser.\n\nNow as a pure piece of entertainment you could do worse than the Last Samurai. Assuming you can stomach Tom Cruise there's a sweeping soundtrack, great visuals, and surprisingly accurate costumes. \n\nIn short it's worth a watch but don't believe that the Meiji restoration was anything like this at all.\n\nWhat I'm surprised was that it's clear the Last Samurai was taking some influence from the true story of Frederick Townsend Ward and his adventures of making a modern military force in Imperial China. Now that's a story I'd like to see adapted into a movie.",

One which even though this may be heralded as a \"White Man Savior Story,\" It does so with respect to the cultures it wishes to portray. While it may have some elements of stereotype and general assumptions about Japan and feudal lifestyles, it does want to strive to do the Japanese cultures and traditions justice.\n\nSome Movies in Hollywood give no second thoughts to the ideas in film they are trying to portray. This film after seeing Dances with Wolves, Pocahontas, and Avatar, really strives and sets itself apart. Those movies with the exception of Dances with Wolves, really miss the mark. This movie marks Cruise's character as more of a messanger at the end, in which stands in place of Wantanabe's after his noble death. \n\nThe film also constantly reminds the viewer of Japan's proud heritage, and love of their culture, though strange to American audiences. So while westernization was inevitable, it also has a cultural impact which strived for in the film. Now an educated viewer, probably would never know exactly what feudal life was like in Japan, nor will they ever experience. This will always be romantic, because of that.\n\nAnyone who dislikes it, I contend they see it, view it also from the perspective of production value. The shots, beautiful, the dramatics were what I would think to be accurate in a period drama, as well as a different cultural respect for Japanese lifestyle.",

It isn't really about \"pride\" or just manhood and \"dying for what you believe\" cliche. There's a deeper implication of sacrifice, Katsumoto's end wasn't simply for his own selfish sense of honor, but he knew the sacrifice would send a message to the emperor about what honor is. In sense, his death gave life to the young Meiji and for the first time he acted like an emperor.\n\nKatsumoto accomplished in death what he couldn't teach the Meiji in life. His death was an act of selflessness, that is the code of honor.\n\n(Aside from that, this is really Dances with Wolves in Japan)",

The story of a troubled american veteran of the civil war traveling to Japan learning their ways and teaching them his own was captivating. This movie does a good job of creating a story using key figures during a very interesting time period of Japanese history.\n\nAlgren's character is a skilled fighter and sharpshooter to begin with but he does learn the way of the sword rather quickly.. I would also say somethings are cliche of other Tom Cruz movies.. There is great beauty in the shots, a good deal of comedy and drama to the characters who develop well through the movie. There's an unspoken understanding to ideologies of honor and a certain way of life..  There is alot more depth to the culture that could have been explored in the story but witht he movie being so long already I'm not to critical of it.. Other than that it was quite believable and enthralling. \n\n(Alot of people take shots at the title about Tom Cruz as \"the last samurai\" because he's white. But if you watch the movie it's a pretty believable story that makes a relatable explorative link between american and Japanese culture. The title I don't believe is meant to be taken so literally. In which case Katsumoto was the last true samurai imo anyway, Algren was just there to help and learn his story.)",

            "content": "The Last Samurai is a tale of a an American soldier who is captured by the \"last samurai\" and comes to quickly respect then fall in with their principles and way of life.  Yes, it pretty much is \"Dances with Wolves\" in East Asia.  However, that aspect of the film is the weakest.  Tom Cruise just doesn't pull off brooding and suicidal very well.  He replaces a depth of character with cheesily overacting most of his scenes at the beginning of the film.  He laughs contemptuously at his old cronies who hire him to become an advisor for the Japanese millitary.  It's so over the top you have to wonder why noone reached across the table and slapped him during an early dinner scene.  There also is kind of a pointless scene where to prove the Japanese soldiers he is training are not ready for battle, stands in front of a target and demands one of his charges shoots him.  Well, in that situation, who wouldn't shoot over his head?  Couldn't he have just shown how none of his men could hit the targets?  To drive home his alcoholism, once captured by the samurai his character repeatedly asks for only saki, in a hilarious manner \"SaaakIiiiii!!\"  That part alone probably gives the movie I reason to be watched, I'm not going to lie.  \nSo of course once Cruise is captured and stops demanding booze every five minutes he quickly realizes the Samurai way is pretty respectable, compared to his shoot everyone in sight mentality in the army.  It would have been nice if this transformation would have taken more than 10 minutes to be completed.  Perhaps the writer know this change was going to be so predictable to anyone who had ever seen a film that it was best just to get it over with.  Cruise's character also shares a home with the family of the man he killed in the opening battle of the film.  This could have let to an interesting dynamic but all the wife really says is \"He smells\", offers to kill herself, and that is the end of it.  If Japanese culture got in the way of her having a greater voice of anger and frustration, why have Cruise stay there in the first place?\nKen Wantanabe easily brings the intensity with intelligence to the film that Cruise has to fake.  We do understand his motivations, he wants to protect the emperor from outside forces that would corrupt the Japanese way of life.  So apparently racism is ok when it involves Japanese nationalism?  \nDespite my criticisms this isn't the worst movie to watch.  It looks really nice and the samurai costumes  are beautiful works of art.  There also is a rousing battle at the end of the film when the samurai use their ingenuity to take on a force much larger than they are.  Score: 6.5",

            "content": "The Last Samurai is a character-driven and dramatic war epic as well as one of Edward Zwick's best films (alongside Glory and Blood Diamond). I'll never understand why Edward Zwick is so underrated as a filmmaker because his films not only deliver great thrills, but great performances and intriguing plot lines as well, and The Last Samurai is no exception. The Last Samurai features intriguing locales, beautiful cinematography, marvelous set pieces, and well-executed battle/action sequences. But what really stands out here are the powerful performances, particularly from Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe. Cruise gives his best performance in what seems like forever with his emotionally unstable former Civil War captain Nathan Algren, who has seen and done too many horrible things in his lifetime and is now coping with the unbearable demons of it all. Ken Watanbe's Katsumoto is the proud and heroic head samurai who, along with his legion of samurai followers, refuses to see Japan become engulfed in western-influenced modernism as well as letting the samurai become a thing of the past, and thus, gives quite a compelling portrayal. And last but certainly not least, Hans Zimmer's orchestral score for the film is absolutely beautiful, evoking all kinds of emotions, especially sadness. And don't simply dismiss this film because it constantly gets compared to Dances With Wolves. It is not a simple rip-off, quite the opposite actually: The Last Samurai takes the concept of what made Dances With Wolves work and improves upon it in every way imaginable and subsequently, is the superior of the two films in my opinion. In conclusion, The Last Samurai is an underrated film from a vastly underrated director that displays powerful emotions through it's powerful performances; simply a beautiful film in almost every aspect.",

Tom Cruise & Ken Watanabe give good performances, and play off each other well.  The action & drama are well paced, and the story draws you in.\nI think part of the problem is the movie chokes on its own self-righteousness.  It's another stranger-in-a-strange-land movie, like Dances With Wolves or Avatar, where the main character is a dejected warrior from a supposedly more civilized nation who finds solace and familial ties as he integrates with a simpler, native culture, which maintains its heritage and balance with nature in the face of industrialization.  Last Samurai tells this story well, but leans towards being pompous, preachy, and, in come scenes, melodramatic, in presenting its theme.  This includes the final battle as the noble samurai go out in a blaze of glory during a last stand with the newly-trained, and Westernized, Japanese army.  \nAnd the point was....actually, that tends to get lost.  Why are the samurai battling the Emperor's soldiers?  To take a stand against corrosive Western influences in order to protect the nation's honor.  Ok, sure, that sounds good.  Bureaucratic corruption is bad.  However, the movie seems to paint both sides in stark contrast.  Modern diplomats and government types are inherently bad as they seek to expand their nations' influence, while the loyal, disciplined samurai, isolated in their village, are inherently good as they eschew modern trappings.  The movie shows very little of the gray areas that more accurately reflect actual societies.\nRegardless, as a movie, Last Samurai is pretty good.  The drama, the score, the acting, etc. are all done well.  And while I have the DVD, it's never my go-to choice for casual viewing.",

Japan brought in experts from the West and mimicked the best of everything in the modern world. As Emperor Meiji is credited for realizing the need for and decreeing the drastic change in Japan, the time period is known as the Meiji era. However, rapid change conflicts with the status quo. As such, traditionalists started to resist modernization and a rebellion is lead by the Samurai, Japan's warrior class. Eventually, the Samurai were crushed by Japan's modern army. The specific time period within the Meiji period when the Samurai fell is known as the Meiji Restoration. The Last Samurai is set during this time.  The movie does an excellent job portraying the era and the differences between modernization and tradition as well as the contrasts between Western and Eastern cultures. However, it obviously idealizes the Samurai. While the positive aspects of the Samurai shown in the film are definitely true, it does not portray a complete picture as it does not address the criticisms of the Samurai. The main point omitted from the movie is the notion that the Samurai were fighting to maintain their power and elite status rather than the purely noble reasons suggested by the film. Nevertheless, it is a movie and not a documentary. It does not need to present a fair and balanced portrayal. I agree with just focusing on the appeal of the ways of the Samurai because it was very well done. When the protagonist of the film, Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), is in a Samurai village within Japan's countryside, he notes that \"There is so much here I will never understand. I've never been a church going man, and what I've seen on the field of battle has led me to question God's purpose. But there is indeed something spiritual in this place. And though it may forever be obscure to me, I cannot but be aware of its power.\" Those words reflect the way I feel about the movie. It is very spiritual and powerful. Hans Zimmer's score for The Last Samurai is perfect as it is able to capture the intensity of war and the tranquility of peace and harmony needed for this film.\n\nPlease see http://rookerville.com/2013/10/17/retroactive-review-last-samurai/ for my full review.",

Although I didn't walk out of it with the same inspiration that he felt, I did walk our having enjoyed a thoroughly good film. The Last Samurai didn't inspire me to do karate. It made me proud to be a karate student.\n\nThe Last Samurai is in fact an inspiring tale, it just has some issues along the way.\nOne of them is that the plot isn't incredible. The story about fighting for the enemy has been told before in better ways such as in Dances With Wolves and in Avatar in inspirational manners, except that in The Last Samurai there is an imbalance between political issues and the story relating to the upcoming battle. The Last Samurai doesn't do the finest job of clarifying what the war is about or what any of the issues are, so the background to the story and political contexts aren't as sensible as appropriate for an epic film.\n\nI watched The Last Samurai at a time in life where I had come into several conflicts, and I learned so much about honour through the samurai beliefs of Bushido overnight that I instantly cleared my head and resolved everything without skipping a heartbeat. It reinvigorated my passion as a karate student and gave me a new set of values to abide by as a person, and when a film does that you know it has to be good. \nThe Last Samurai isn't just good because of the effect it has on the viewer, but as an American film it actually has a deep and meaningful understanding of what Bushido is all about, and therefore what it means to be a samurai. It follows the real heart of the beliefs and goes into a strong understanding as to what it means to be a samurai, and it goes very well in depth.\nIt also had some of the coolest action ever. The well choreographed fight sequences and war battles are absolute exemplary in visual quality and entertainment value, and have such an exceptional aesthetic look since The Last Samurai benefits from incredible cinematography, excellent costume design and some beautiful locations combined with unforgettable imagery from the production design. Edward Zwick direction is excellent and he truly has a strong understanding for Bushido.\nTom Cruise gives one of the best performances of his career in The Last Samurai. In one of his finest hours, Tom Cruise puts his limited acting skills to the test and comes out shining on the other side with a character holding a convincing burning desire and passion for the way of the samurai. His articulation of words is intense and strong, with a rich delivery and real sense of morality and strength behind them. Tom Cruise really is The Last Samurai.\nBut benefitting from his Japanese internationality and natural acting talent, Ken Wantabe secures an Academy Award nomination with his excellent performance. Ken Wantabe perfectly captures the passion of a samurai warrior with all the values of Bushido without failing for a second. He is consistently strong and his performance is deep and meaningful; and his finest work so far.\nTimothy Spall is also a memorable screen presence and boasts a fine performance, and essentially the entire supporting cast fails to ever let The Last Samurai down.\n\nSo The Last Samurai has premise flaws, but it's exploration of samurai culture and production values are impeccable.",

Another is that it romanticizes the ideals of this part of Japanese culture, which perpetuates a misunderstanding of western involvement, and borders on melodrama...hmm. Unfortunately, America is never as innocent as we like to believe, but that is a whole other conversation. My answer is, I get it. It glorifies a dream, whether real or imagined, of samurai culture. Even though this version is full of holes, I still wanted to buy into that dream. The film is beautifully shot, and I think, well paced. I know Dani, among others, found it slow moving. Also, this film introduced me to Ken Watanabe, and I have been a fan since. His performance is off the hook, for which he was deservedly nominated for an Oscar.",

Nathan Algren, a haunted veteran of the U.S. Civil War, is hired by Japan's Emperor to train an army in the use of guns and modern military tactics for the extermination of the rebelling samurai. Algren and company are forced into battle before they're ready, which leads to many deaths and Algren's capture. The samurai leader, Katsumoto, decides to keep Algren alive to learn about his enemy, and over time Algren learns the ways of the samurai and finds them spiritual and full of beauty. War is imminent after his release, and Algren isn't sure if he should return to the U.S. or fight alongside the people he has come to love.\nI was pleasantly surprised by Tom Cruise's performance as Nathan Algren, and Ken Watanabe is fantastic and well-deserving of his award nomination as Katsumoto. The story itself is inspiring about the importance of not forgetting where we've come from, and the action sequences are fun to watch. This movie is rated R for violence, and rightfully so as there is a lot of gun-shooting, sword thrusting, blood and brief gore. If you can handle intense violence, though, \"The Last Samurai\" is a beautifully moving and entertaining epic.",

Additionally, the writing does an effective job at depicting the culture clashes, and at developing the characters.  The score by Hans Zimmer is brilliantly done as well, perfectly complementing the film and enhancing the themes.

            "content": "One of the most inspiring, exciting, and phenomenal movie that enybody can watch. After \"Glory\" Edward Zwick deliver's another masterpiece!\nThe story takes place during the early modernization of Japan, in the 1870s and 1880s. The Emperor's power has been weakened by the political and economic power of his cabinet, by his young age, and by the political influence of the United States and other western powers pulling the strings of his cabinet and supplying modern weaponry and tactics to the modernizing Japanese army. Cruise plays Captain Allgren, an alcoholic veteran who has seen and participated in too many massacres of innocent people, and is offered an opportunity to reclaim some of his honor by helping to train the Japanese military in the use of firearms. \nThe cast is exemplary. Tom Cruise is so good in this film that it is very often easy to forget he is Tom Cruise. Easily his most powerful role and best performance since Jerry Maguire; Ken Watanabe, however, is incredible in every scene - acting with a rare sensitivity and intensity and breathing life into a character much larger and more human than the grand story of which he is a part. Though the entire cast is excellent.\nEdward Zwick has made a film which operates well at every level, carrying simple but profound philosophical ideas, but avoiding the mistake of making these ideas and the characters that express them super-heroic. Ultimately, this beautifully shot film conveys powerful messages about war, tradition, ethics, honor and culture, which, though not particularly original, are sensitively and intelligently brought forward. There is a lot of action, including some remarkably well-acted sword fighting and martial artistry, but none of it seems unnecessary and the whole film is truly tightly woven. My highest recommendation.",

Just like \"Troy\" the acting, the high production values, and big scale battles outdo any hiccups from the plot.\n\nThe Last Samurai follows an American military advisor embracing the Samurai culture he was hired to destroy after he is captured in battle. The story is serviceable at best. Its slow pace is fitting since the protagonist is adsorbing Japan culture. This gives the audience a good idea of the protagonist steady transformation over the course of the film. However, even the film protagonist suffers from some cliche traits. Haunted by past demons, a chance of redemption, being an alcoholic, and a new found sense of honor. The whole plot is like this. For every good idea it has there is some negative to it. The primary one being an examination on war which the film has no clear stance on. The protagonist is haunted by his previous war experiences, but embraces a culture that fight with honor in war. From a viewer standpoint should we applaud the hero fighting to a keep a culture alive or be worried that our hero has not learn a nothing from his past experiences. It's this kind of uneven writing that contribute to it emotional detachment.\n\nThe acting is top notch from the American and Japanese cast. Tom Cruise does play a rather cliche flawed hero, but makes the hero worth following. He never over plays his character almost as if Cruise knows the hero has been done to death. Cruise co-star Ken Wantanabe outshines him. He is able to hide his character confuse emotion perfectly. The intensity of his looks and the conviction of his lines make him shine brighter than Cruise. The villains played by Spall and Connolly are colorful, but contribute little. The same could be said with actress Koyuki who's given little to work with and not enough time to go beyond a one dimensional character. The splendid cinematography captures the well orchestrated battle scenes giving them a sense of scope and raw feel to them. These battle scenes won't stack up against a Kurosawa epic or 13 Assassins, but the battle scenes are a stunning sight to behold. The costumes are nicely detailed and even the samurai armors look convincing down to the smallest piece.\n\nThe Last Samurai writing is mixed, but everything else from acting to production values justify its two and a half hour running time. You might not be emotionally invested into the film, but you will be satisfy with this epic that captures the look and entertainment of a epic.",

Like \"Braveheart\" and \"Gladiator\", the film is riddled with historical inaccuracies. And Tom Cruise, while servicable, isn't exactly on top of his game in the lead role.\n\nSupporting players, such as Ken Watanabe, Billy Connolly and Timothy Spall, do a much stronger job on the acting end, and this helps move the film along.\n\nBut the gripping battle scenes, and the strong climax, make this film mostly worth the wait.

My gripe with it is that this film should be a cross culture look into themes like retribution, grace, tradition and the samurai code, unfortunately what it is borders on melodrama and fluff. Cruise's acting at times is unconvincing and the script is utterly flawed but the rest of the movie is too good to pass up.",
