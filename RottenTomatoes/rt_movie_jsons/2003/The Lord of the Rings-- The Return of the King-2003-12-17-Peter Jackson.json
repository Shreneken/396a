Andy Serkis and Sean Astin being the particular stand outs of this third film.\nScore- Howard Shore's absolute best and most emotionally impactful.\nDirecting/Adaptation- Peter Jackson created the best version of J.R.R Tolkien's story.

Tolkien's iconic novels.\n\nThe film picks up where the previous two films left off, with Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continuing their journey to destroy the One Ring, while Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) lead the armies of men, elves, and dwarves into battle against the forces of Sauron.\n\nThe Return of the King is a true epic, with breathtaking battle scenes, stunning visuals, and an emotionally charged storyline that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. The film is also a fitting conclusion to the trilogy, bringing together all the threads from the previous films and delivering a satisfying payoff to the audience.\n\nThe film was praised for its technical achievements, including its visual effects, cinematography, and sound design, and was awarded 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Song.\n\nOverall, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is a masterful and breathtaking conclusion to one of the greatest cinematic trilogies of all time. Whether you're a fan of the novels or not, this film is a must-watch for anyone who loves epic, action-packed, and emotionally charged cinema.",

I'm so sick of it. Also, the lands are too emtpy, the distances are too short and Eowyn's bellicose posturing is not criticized. Still, it's a great movie.\n\nTip: watch the EXTENDED EDITION. It's much better than the standard one.",

            "content": "A Classic Epic Fantasy Film and a Excellent Conclusion to The Beloved Trilogy. The acting is phenomenal across the board along with an amazing music score just like its predecessors. The cinematography is very well done in this. The only problems I would say is that there is ALOT more green screen and CGI in this one compared to the other 2 that had a lot more practical effects and on location scenes and it looks out of place compared to the other 2. There is a couple scenes in this as well that are oversaturated with CGI and the scene with Legolas taking the elephant down is stupid (And the only time I would say that about a scene in this trilogy). The editing is very well done in this though just a tad below the other 2 which also goes hand in hand with really the only dent being this films pacing is not as good as the other 2. It's still good pacing but the 6 minute opening with Smeagle's backstory and the 15 minutes after Aragon is crowned King feel like they are slow and don't really contribute anything to the main journey and aren't needed and make things drag at the start and end a bit. The other issue is while the scenes with Froto, Sam & Smeagle are good in their own right they go own awhile and we've already seen this in Two Towers so it feels like even though its needed for plot we've already seen it and king of makes things drag a bit. Though the amazing battle scenes more than make up for it. If that was the only issue and not the other 21 minutes than it wouldn't really be a problem. Overall this is a somewhat bloated Classic Fantasy Epic that everyone will enjoy to an all time classic trilogy.",

Throughout the years, I have seen all the cartoons, listened to the books on tape, played with the lead figures in the 1970s as an early teen, etc. Back in early and mid 1970's, there wasn't a ton of LOR imagery and art. It was mostly in your head. This was before the Dungeons and Dragons explosion. Peter Jackson did an excellent version of these books. The characters look just like you imagined as a child reading the books. The introduction of the female elf character, in my opinion, even enhanced the stories and was well acted. I wished Jackson had carried all this quality into The Hobbit series that he made a little too much like a fantasy video game that was all over the place in parts. But that said, these 3 LOR movies are excellent and anyone would be hard pressed to out do them for many, many years to come.",

The script is incredibly well written and the slick dialogue is performed masterfully. From \"I am no man\" to \"For Frodo!\" to \"My lady!\" and many more, there are chill-inducing moments due to smart writing.\n\nWhile it is emotionally draining to complete the trilogy, it is equally fulfilling. There is a lot packed into these 10 hours of film (non-extended editions). Though long and complicated, Return of the King wraps up the best trilogy ever made with elegance.\n\nBest Character: Samwise Gamgee (Top 5 most selfless character in all of cinema)\nBest Moment: The \"My friends, you bow to no one\" scene\nBest Quote: \"I can't carry it for you, but I can carry you!\" - Sam",

It is funny, thrilling, sincere, thought provoking, sad and ultimately relatable.\n\nThe good vs bad story has been told over and again in cinema, but yet from the J R R Tolkien epic Peter Jackson has created the absolute epitome of this genre. \n\nThe characters are all perfectly cast and perfectly played by each and every actor from the main cast to the extras. To name a few Vigo Mortenson as Aragorn is sublime, Ian Mckellan as Gandalf is fabulous and Elijah Wood as Frodo is true the nature of Frodo and his age defining quest.  \n\nTo conclude, it is without doubt cinema at its very perfection and as I have already mentioned, we shall never see its like again. \n\nA heartfelt and sincere thank you to Peter Jackson, for creating such an incredible and beautiful piece of visual art that has defined cinema as we know it. \n\nNi 'lassui En",

This is packed with more thrills, more emotion, more epic battles and spectacular effects, and more poetry than even the first two wonderful films. Everyone from the cast brings their A-game, and everyone gets their moment or two to shine. This leg of the journey is fraught with tension, frights, and brings you to the edge of your seat. It isn't flawless, with an over-extended epilogue that outstays its welcome, one of the longest in movie-going memory. But you can't say Jackson and his team screwed up.

            "content": "\"The Return of the King\" is by far the most moving, inspirational, and epic of Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings Trilogy movies. The movie plot is compelling with themes of friendship, strength, and loyalty. Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee continue their quest to destroy the One Ring at Mount Doom led by Gollum. Gollum becomes more cunning and sneaky than ever. Gandalf the White, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli regroup with Merry and Pippin in Isengard, and they learn that Sauron is planning a full-scale attack on the largest city of men, Minas Tirith in Gondor. The rest of the Fellowship prepares for another battle to hold Minas Tirith against an onslaught of the armies of Mordor. A distress called is sent to Rohan, and King Theoden is able muster a large army of Rohirrim, to set out for Minas Tirith. After the free people's victory at the Battle Pelennor Fields, the Fellowship what remaining forces of Gondor and Rohan that they have and storm the Black Gate to distract the Eye of Sauron's gaze and buy time for Frodo to finish his quest. The movie set for Minas Tirith, The City of Kings, is very gorgeous. The lighting of the beacon is authentic. The costumes, weapons, armor, props and movie sets are very well tailored by the film crew. The special effects for the army of the Dead (oathbreakers), Gollum, Shelob the spider, the mumakil, the eagles, Sauron's Eye, the fellbeasts and the trolls are breathtaking and incredible. The movie visuals for Minas Tirith, Pelennor Fields, Osgiliath, The Grey Havens, Mordor, The Black Gate, Mount Doom, Minas Morgul and Shelob's Lair are spectacular. King Thedeon's speech at Pelennor Fields and Aragorn's speech at the Black Gate are some of the best movie battle speeches ever. The heroism and romance are incredibly moving. Gandalf's speech to Pippin about death being another path to take in life is so emotional. Sam Gamgee's devotion to Frodo is something that can show what true friendship is. The battles are amazing and always heightening the tension. The tension for the siege on Minas Tirith is so highly anticipated. The acting and the cast crew are superb. Sir Ian McKellen is flawless in his role as Gandalf the White. Viggo Mortenssen is at his charismatic in his role as Aragorn. Sean Astin captures Samwise Gamgee perfectly and is able to provide the character's heart. Andy Serkis provides a stirring and great performance as Smeagol/Gollum. Orlando Bloom as Legolas and John Rhys-Davies as Gimli carry their roles very well. Elijiah Wood gives a great performance as Frodo Baggins descending into corruption with an incredible talent. Dominic Monaghan (Merry) and Billy Boyd (Pippin) still make a great duo. David Wenham is particularly good in his role as Faramir. John Noble gives a brilliant performance as the tragic and broken Lord Denethor. Bruce Spencer was wonderful in his role as the treacherous Mouth of Sauron in the extended edition. Lawrence Makoare was incredible in his role as Gothmog, the orc lieutenant from Minas Morgul. The rest of the cast including Bernard Hill, Mirianda Otto, Karl Urban, Ian Holm, Liv Tyler, Cate Blanchett and Hugo Weaving are perfect in their roles. The Battle of Pelennor Fields is still the most spectacular and epic battle sequences in Hollywood movie history. The visual effects of battle at Minas Tirith are stunning and perfectly executed. The incredible scope of the battle with the special effects, sounds, and many close-ups of pieces of the action make for an exciting scene. The final stand at the Black Gate is so emotional involving and is done so with vision beyond imagination. The many endings that follow are brilliant.",

The filming was also excellent, and the special effects were very well thought out. The music was well synchronised with the atmosphere, which gave the impression of living the scene. I enjoyed the script and the dialogue, which was not at all out of place in other films.

The battle of Minas Tirith is so well built up. The geography of the location is fully setup from the very scene we are introduced to Minas Tirith. The Ride of Rohirrim is not a Deus Ex Machina as it is constantly being built up on the other side. The ups and downs in the battle are placed very well throughout and makes it very engaging.\n\nFrodo and Sam's quest to destroy the ring is also really good.

            "content": "I admit it, I love all three Lord of the Rings films. People may say Return of the King is the best of the trilogy, some may say it is the worst. I personally think Two Towers is the best for its scope and better exploration of some of the characters, but while it is still great Return of the King is better than Fellowship of the Ring.\n\nMy only slight disappointment is the ending, it does feel overlong and bloated for me, almost as if there was more than one ending filmed. That said, what does make the ending at least watchable for me is the way it is shot, the marvellous score and the performance of Gollum.\n\nDespite this minor discrepancy, Return of the King is extremely good and in my view one of the better Best Picture winners last decade. Peter Jackson's direction is very impressive here, and the scope is massive and just dazzling to watch. All three films of the trilogy are very well made, but Return of the King defines the term epic. The cinematography is mind-blowing, the scenery is superb, the costumes and make-up are well tailored, the effects are superb and don't distract too much and the lighting is authentic.\n\nThe score is phenomenal. Fellowship of the Ring had some ethereal, rousing, haunting and charming themes, whereas Two Towers was somewhat darker and more complex. Return of the King merges these together and the result is a perfect mixture of charm, darkness, etherality and complexity. The story is compelling with themes of friendship, strength and loyalty, the screenplay is well-written and literate and while the film is very long the three hours or so fly by seamlessly. The characters are engaging, Aragorn is even more interesting here than he is in the previous films while Gollum continues to steal every scene he appears in.\n\nThe acting is very good. Orlando Bloom(who I can find dashing yet uncharismatic and bland) and John Rhys-Davies are given less to do but do carry their parts very well, and Elijah Wood is likable enough. Sean Astin captures Sam perfectly and provides the heart of the picture, and Viggo Mortenssen is at his charismatic best here. Ian McKellen is perfectly cast, while the design of Gollum is still superb and Andy Serkis is equally phenomenal. I was slightly disappointed by the lack of any Sarauman, but I was more than I was satisfied with the final result.\n\nAll in all, an outstanding entry to a great trilogy. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

And when it does, you better not blink because you'll miss something.\n\nSome things I thought while watching:\nI counted two wilhelm screams‚Ä¶ as stated before, it's not a proper fight scene without one!\nGimli is still the best character, Aragorn is still awesome, and Legolas is still performed poorly (acting wise).\nI rather liked Smeagol‚Ä¶ he was cute(?) for a minute there. Plus he's a master class deceiver and that's pretty sick\nHow many times is Sam going to say \"Mr. Frodo!\"\nThe SCORE!!!! I will never get over how the score(s) made me feel. The emotions start stirring HEAVILY\nWow Frodo was the absolute worst the entire first two movies but hey maybe I like him in this one\nI've said it once and I'll say it again, Gandolf is FAST like he's apparently 24,000 years old and dude can sprint!!! It's insane\nPLEASE JUST LET GO!\nSo THATS why it's called The Return of the King!\nGood heavens this ending is devastating.\n\nIt's good. It's great even. Honestly, it's amazing.

We are instead left with a protagonist (who had already become worthless halfway through the second movie) making a heel turn long after all respect for him had been lost.

            "content": "This is my third and final review of the trilogy. In the first movie's review I called it an RPG game and mentioned on how the world building was done adn how great the visuals were. In the second review I said it was like watching a book come to life and talked about the character development and philosophy/message the movie gave. In this third review I have called it an art and here I will talk about the story and why it will be remembered not just as a masterpiece, but also as a legacy. Keep in mind that all the reviews have been written separately but all of them imply to all three movies.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings is one long story that has been divided equally among three movies. Because of this there is virtually no major difference between the them, and all the three movies have received almost the same ratings. Normally in trilogies the stories do not directly pick up from where the last one left but rather these are three different stories, because of which it is possible to have two great movies and one movie which does not live up to them (Sam Raimi's Spider-Man, Christopher Nolan's Batman, the original Star Wars trilogy, Godfather etc), or there is one great movie while the other two don't live up to that (Zack Snyder's Superman, Star Wars prequel and sequel trilogies, Jurassic Park etc).\n\nHere the risk was much bigger. Since there is just one story, either the entire trilogy would have been good or the entire trilogy would have been bad. This is why the movies were so long. The story is set in a fantasy world and not everyone has read the original books by JRR Tolkien. So Peter Jackson had to elaborate every minor detail. There should have been no questions left. The audience should've had a clear idea of what they were watching. Normally such things are only possible in TV shows which are book adaptations like Game of Thrones or The Man in the High Castle since they have enough time in their hands to explain everything. This, however, was a movie series. This is the reason why the runtime is so long. The total runtime of the trilogy is 10+ hours, and 12+ hours if you watch the extended cut.\n\nAnother major problem that could have plagued this movie, if it wasn't addressed, was the number of characters and the fact that all of them were in different places doing different things. There were some minor characters right in the beginning of the story and some in the middle. All of them had to be humanised, something which is possible only if we get to know more about them. Because of this the story is moved forward such that we are made to care about all of the people. While we ask what happened to Gimli and Legolas in the battle, we are also worried that Frodo has been tricked by Gollum and is about to be eaten by a giant spider. The direction does not shift in the bias of any of the characters, otherwise the ones the audience cares about would have been left behind. People often make fun of the half-hour long epilogue shown in the end of The Return of the King, but imagine if it was not there. So many characters would have received vague endings. This was meant to assure that all the good characters got good endings and the bad guys got bad endings.\n\nI'd also take a moment to talk about Gimli and Legolas' relation. In the beginning they both hated each other but later on they grow to become friends. This is another great message that the movie sends us. In my previous review of philosophy I didn't mention it because it was seen in this movie. It talks about how we hate some people based on their appearance, their beliefs, their way of life. But we end up becoming friends with those same people once we actually interact with them. People were never meant to hate each other. This is something we are taught to do. This is also seen when Aragorn unleases the Army of the Dead. They never wanted to work with the living because of their hatred, but when one of them came forward and made the request, they gave in. It is these small moments that show the humanity in all the characters.\n\nAnd finally, what makes it a legacy? Today everyone knows about The Lord of the Rings. Gandalf is the first thing someone imagines when they hear the word \"wizard\", in spite of there being a more popular book adaptation movie franchise which is literally about wizards. So many RPG games have their stories set in the manner of \"some characters with different abilities go out on a dangerous yet exotic adventure\". Elijah Wood has become world famous for his role as Frodo Baggins. Gollum, in spite of being the same annoying character found in all fantasy movies, is more popular than Jar Jar or Dobby. All of this is possible because of the way the story unfolds. Everyone who was evil was simply so because of the circumstances, and those who were good were because of how much the story emphasised on their actions. This coupled with great direction and a good world building made it so popular.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings is one of the era defining movies of our times. It looks like a painting brought to life, one that we used to look at in fairy tales and nursery rhymes. It is the first thing that comes to someone's mind when they think of a fantasy adventure set in the medieval era. The patience of the creators and the fans is what made this trilogy so powerful. I really hope we get to see more such adaptations of books that we haven't heard about. This one has made a benchmark that will be hard to reach in the near future unless a miracle happens.",

Upon finding that Sauron plans to strike the city of Minas Tirith, the heart of Gondor, Gandalf and Pippin ride to the city only to find Denethor, a madman in control of the city who is totally unfit to be the Steward. Eventually, the forces of Gondor, Rohan, Eriador and Mordor all coincide at Minas Tirith for the largest and in my opinion, best battle not only in this saga, but in all of cinematic history. Every scene in this movie holds weight to it, it is my favourite in the trilogy and seeing Aragorn finally take his place becoming King of the Reunited Kingdom always brings a tear to my black heart.

In terms of acting as the Climax of the Trilogy, is most certainly contains the most adrenaline-pumping sequences, almost all of them top-tier excellent, and the emotional payoff to this Trilogy is highly effective.  The performances are solid-to-excellent across the board, and as before, the Artistic and Technical merits are both outstanding.  Like the others, it has stood the test of time, it now being 18 years old at the time of my review, and while I am certainly open to the idea of more Middle Earth content existing to expand upon this Tale (some games like War in the North and Shadow of Mordor doing a surprisingly good job), I genuinely hope they don't attempt to tell the Lord of the Rings (proper) ever again, as it might very well be impossible to do better than this Trilogy did.  It's inspirational, it's emotional, it will make you cheer and will make your eyes watery, and all three of these have rightfully gone into the History Books of Cinema.",

The action is also very entertaining especially  when it comes to the big war scenarios, which set a whole new standard (at least when it comes to the genre). The score is also iconic. The extended versions may be worth a look, especially the third one.",

I, funnily enough, wouldn't actually say it's necessarily the most perfect execution - what with the plot coincidences and extreme character armour. But that doesn't matter one jot whatsoever, as the story wraps up in arguably the best way - at least to watch - possible. It has so much heart and feeling to it.\n\nThe story involving the characters of Elijah Wood, Sean Astin and Andy Serkis remained the most interesting to me, I was very satisfied with how it concluded in regards to them. I also enjoyed the bits we got of Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen & Co. All that added to the beautiful look and creation of the film, with the world coming alive splendidly.\n\nIf I were to nit-pick further, I would say the run time is slightly too long. The pacing is absolutely fine, very good in fact, but I coulda done without a few of the many end scenes - a lot of which are necessary and welcome, but a couple could've been left out to allow the viewer to imagine how the world continued. That's just how I feel mind, I'm sure I'm one of only a few that think that way.\n\nBack onto the positives: how about those battle sequences? Astonishingly good. A sensational trilogy, no question about it. I look forward to seeing 'The Hobbit' films.",

After the first two parts followed the journey of the fateful ring and served as an ideal set-up for the final chapter, The Return of the King brings along everything we love: Action, emotional moments and, for the time, unthinkably artistic images and great visual effects.\n\nAs in the first two parts, the cast does not stand out for individual performance. It's the whole collective that makes the difference and once again shines with its unique chemistry. Above all, the interpersonal relationships come out even more in the third part. Frodo (Elijah Wood) and his loyal gardener Sam (Sean Astin) provide several scenes in which their unbreakable friendship and affection for each other becomes clear. Especially in the conflict with the malicious Gollum (Andy Serkis), these are constantly put to the test. Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn always seems like the insider protagonist. He acts very altruistically and never leaves the side of his allies. In interactions with the cheeky Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom) he also has quite funny moments. Ian McKellen is a fixed presence in his comeback as Gandalf, as he so often is, and makes us forget his absence from the second part with his wisdom and authenticity.\n\nEach part of The Lord of the Rings is special in its own way. What sets The Return of the King ahead of its two predecessors is that the story is told out in the almost three hours of running time. As a result, intense scenes take place almost every minute, which are captivating the audience. Contrary to other fantasy dramas, this one also does not contain too many cheesy moments. It is nevertheless a pity that the few female roles in this film are mostly reduced to these. Nevertheless, Peter Jackson has created a masterpiece with this trilogy that is still unrivalled, especially in terms of the visual factor. For the manageable resources available in the early 2000s, The Lord of the Rings paved the way for the technical revolution in Hollywood. The Return of the King is a closing chapter to this breathtaking three-parter.",

You can't convince me this movie definitely had to be over 4 hours. There was plenty that could have been trimmed. And if they didn't want to do that, they desperately needed to break each of these films up into 2 movies. That said, the world-building is as good as any movie. The giant elephants and eagles and dragons and trees are all pretty cool. The story is just a bit too disney-like to me. The characters have minimal flaws and are never short on altruism or bravery. The characters are just not that believable. These are good movies but IMDB has all 3 of them in the top 15 all time. I would never put any of them that high. Still worth a watch at least once.",

I will, I can't think of a single villain like Sauron, I can't think of a villain where you only really see him for around 5 minutes at the beginning of the ‚Äòfellowship of the ring' yet he has such an effect throughout\n\n13 Acadamy Awards well earned (should be more for best actors)",

            "content": "Peter Jackson's The Return of the King is one of those good fantasy films to end one of the most popular trilogies. Frodo (Elijah Wood), Sam (Sean Astin) and Gollum (Andy Serkis) travel to Mount Doom in Mordor to destroy the One Ring, only to be betrayed by Gollum. Gandalf (Ian McKellan), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and the other Fellowship members team up with Theoden's army from Rohan, the Army of the Dead and the great eagles to defeat Sauron's army. Meanwhile, Arwen (Liv Tyler), worrying about the fate of Aragorn and Middle-Earth, chooses mortality and slowly dies during the war, only to live in the end. Normally, I don't get invested in these epic fantasy films or television series because it takes time to sink into the environments and characters before I confuse one name over another, like Brego (Aragorn's horse) with Snowmane (Theodon's horse). So when I see The Lord of the Rings (a franchise that contains hundreds of Hobbits, elves, warriors, monarchs, wizards or Orcs and has three-plus hours worth of films), I have to recognize the actors' faces or research them before I learn their character names, specifically for minor ones. However, that does not mean I can't watch The Return of the King and enjoy myself, especially if it's really good.  While I got invested in the epic battle in Pelennor Field with the Mumakil and Fell Beasts, I had resentment for the giant eagles which could have taken the Hobbits to Mount Doom and have them drop the ring in the lava. Also, unless you weren't suckered into seeing the extended cut, you ended up scratching your head wondering where Saruman (Christopher Lee) went since The Two Towers. Nitpicking aside, I enjoyed the action, the character interactions, the costume design, and the emotional ending. \n\n(4 Extended Blu Ray Versions out of 5)",

            "content": "I absolutely love this film and it is my all-time favorite film and I don't think anything will surpass it ever. For this whole trilogy, it is about the journey and the end instead of the phrase \"Its about the journey, not the end\" and I think that it's about the journey and the end really sums up the whole trilogy. I love the character arcs in this film I really do to see Frodo change and to see Aragorn change really makes me feel good inside to see that I have experienced something truly amazing. This is one of the best films ever made and every aspect of film making is at its best in this film nothing will top the quality of this film in my opinion. I think of the whole trilogy as the three acts for Frodo the Fellowship is the first act exposition and the inciting incident and The Two Towers is the second act, rising action and Return of the King is the climax and the resolution that's how I think it is for everyone else it is the normal three act structure for everyone except for Frodo in my opinion. I just can't stop talking about the fabulous score it just is amazing and I don't know how some can not like at all. These films really challenge the morals of everyone in them especially Frodo with the ring. I love the costumes they made for the whole trilogy and I just learned that they filmed these back to back which is very interesting and I think that is the only film to ever do that. I love how all of the storylines just smoothly weave themselves together. If there is one actor that deserves an Oscar more than anyone in Hollywood right now it Andy Serkis I will preach it until he wins for motion capture because he is better at motion capture than some actors working today. The buildup to the battle/war at the end is amazing and will be one of the best battles ever created and put to screen. I love Elijah Wood's acting in this he has such an emotional range in this trilogy and it is kinda sad that he got snubbed. I love the spider sequence so much there is to much tension and suspense in that scene and the tension and suspense are created amazingly in this film and the set design I absolutely loved for the sequence. I love the final battle/war so much and when they are fighting and the score kicks in and it feels amazing and that's when you feel like you have waited for this since the beginning of Fellowship. That will remain my favorite battle of all time and this has some of my favorite scenes of all time and it will remain my favorite ending of all time and it will remain the best ending of all time in my opinion. The ending really paid off after we have been with everyone through this whole trilogy it is kinda sad to not see them in anything else. I can safely say that this is the best trilogy of all time and I have so much nostalgia for the whole franchise and I hope they release the Fellowship next year for the 20th anniversary. One thing I will say is that spoilers if you haven't seen it just read the next paragraph I love that they crown Aragorn and give the hobbits the respect that they need and deserve because without them they couldn't have returned the ring.\n\nI love the score and I will keep praising it until I die because dang if it is not the best score of all time and the most iconic in my opinion. The sound mixing and the sound editing is amazing in the war at the end with all of the action and the sound and the score it really feels like you are mixed with the amazing cinematography it really feels like you are there with them. I love the location for the final battle it looks amazing looking at New Zealand and the whole set looks amazing. Like before the color grading is amazing and looks amazing against the New Zealand background. The script is amazing and one of my favorites and the character development I absolutely love and finishing the character arcs just fills me with joy inside. I love the action in the final scene and it is better than some of the action films nowadays and the action in all is fabulous and it has two of my favorite battles of all time. The makeup and prosthetics look amazing, so much better than what the Hobbit did. Overall I would recommend this to everyone on the planet.\nüíØ%",

The action scenes are very impressive and the production with the CGI creates a gorgeous world and landscape. High praise to the music throughout echoing the fantasy, the fighting and the impact of the ring. The cast is excellent with a script coming straight out the pages of Tolkien's book. Its hard to name a stand out as everyone does a great job, i enjoyed Sean Astin as Sam, Frodo's companion, Viggo Mortensen offers class and Ian McKellen is always watchable. The battle scenes containing so many characters and must have taken a long time to edit and the camera pans across many different angles as we look from a birds eyes view and close ups. Its looks and feels very dramatic. The make up of the army from Mordor is extremely impressive as a very horrific look. The emotional scenes strengthen the film, and i did tear up as Aragorn says you bow to know one to the Hobbits. The film is very long and could have finished earlier, but we need the sense that the Hobbits get back to real life and things try to get back to normal. It is fine for Sam but Frodo holding the ring has changed. The film feels very mythical and religious. Spiritual elements echo through the film. Frodo and Sams adventure leads to a spider which is a very frightening scene feeling very tense. One of the best fantasy films ever made, you sense the love of being involved from the actors, to the production team. A well deserved Oscar winner.",

Fellowship introduces us to the franchise, Two Towers gives us arguably the best character development and plot advancement, and Return of the King is essentially a three act epic within a larger three act epic; you could argue it's the \"ring cycle\" of fantasy cinema. The third instalment is a monumental piece of filmmaking, masterfully written and acted, visually everything about the film is breathtaking, and each plot strand ties into one another so incredibly well, as it has done since the Fellowship all went their separate ways. Elijah Wood absolutely knocks it out of the park as ever, portraying Frodo's gradual descent into the ring of power's control, and the physical and psychological toll it takes on him with absolute aplomb. Ian McKellen is always a domineering presence on stage or screen, and there could not have been a better cast for Gandalf if they had tried, this is where he really comes into his own as the kind hearted, yet fierce and noble white wizard. Whilst every cast member was spectacular, particular kudos has go to Andy Serkis, whom has become synonymous with the mentally unhinged Gollum/Sm√©agol, and seeing him portray the character's pre-ring self and subsequent descent into madness was an absolute joy. Visuals and acting aside, the real star of the show is Howard Shore's magnificent score, he must go down as one of the all-time greats of film composition, as the LOTR trilogy film score is one I could just sit and listen to on repeat. I could sit and gush about what makes this such an incredible achievement in cinema until the cows come home, all you need to know really is this: Lord of the Rings is a masterpiece of a trilogy, and anyone who thinks otherwise just doesn't understand it.",

With the movie focusing on the destruction of the almighty and powerful Ring, that corrupts almost all that touch it and Frodo was tasked with the deliverance of it to Mount Doom. On the way there, he met the fabled Gollum who was a hobbit once born in the same shire, but got corrupted by the Ring. Sam and Frodo met him on their adventure, and since Gollum knew the way to the volcano better than both Sam and Frodo he lead them to there. The Gollum and Sm√©agol battle was brilliantly played out, and it started my love/hate feelings for the character. Gollum was the corrupted version of Sm√©agol, and he desire for getting the ring kept growing throughout the movie. The movie was the best of the trilogy in my opinion, and it was a beautiful coda to this masterpiece.",

The Dead King and co. are a well realised, visually cool bunch of deus ex machina and Gandalf steeling Merry for death is a beautiful moment. The final battle flows extremely well, it's nothing tonally alike to the filthy last stand at Helms Deep, this is trained army vs trained army. The focus of Aragorn's conclusion to be crowned rightfully King is satisfying and the right icing on the cake. \n\nRegarding the extended edition, it's made weakest of the three only insofar as the theatrical of Return of the King is the most complete and impressive of the three. However, the opening scenes of Sauron are the most required and missed from the theatrical and I'm in favour of the many endings of this film because after 11 hours of movie, it earns the right to take an hour to draw to a close.",

            "content": "Epic and majesty!\n\nThis review will be not so much about The Return of the King, but about the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy as a whole, because it is perceived by me as completely and unanimously as possible. I cannot divide this global history into parts, and therefore I will speak about everything here.\n\nSince I last watched The Lord of the Rings, 6 years have passed, which is probably the biggest break, and I decided to rediscover Middle-earth. Moreover, the Fellowship of the Ring recently celebrated its 20th anniversary. First time watching it with subtitles. I watched, of course, the director's versions, which I strongly recommend to everyone. If you have not watched the director's cuts of this trilogy, then you cannot assume that you have watched The Lord of the Rings at all. This is one of the few films where the theatrical versions are not really complete, which affects the perception.\n\nI see no point in writing something about this, without a doubt, the greatest film trilogy. Everyone knows everything and so - these are films in which all the elements converged in the best way: the script, director's work, camera work, cast and acting, special effects, makeup, costumes, music, atmosphere - absolutely everything! And such an epic saga was not filmed either before or after. Even Peter Jackson himself failed to repeat his success in The Hobbits. Everything that can be good in a movie is good here. The Oscar record speaks for itself, because at that time this award had not yet discredited itself.\n\nEven the Russian dubbing here is one of the best. This time I watched, of course, without him, but on some scenes I specifically included dubbing in order to listen and compare. And almost everywhere it is flawless! As if the original voices spoke in Russian!\n\nI actually just found out this year that there are people who don't like The Lord of the Rings! For me it was a surprise. Paradoxically, with each viewing, I love these films more and more and always find something new in them and somehow rediscover them. Not a single part seems boring or drawn out to me - everything is in its place.\n\nAnd The Return of the King, which is a whopping 4 hours long (I have never seen longer films), looks at all in one breath. I love long films in general, but other long films like The Godfathers, Once Upon a Time in America or The Irishman don't compare to the ease of watching the third Lord of the Rings. I don't know how the creators managed it, that 4 hours fly by faster than when watching some one and a half hour movies.\n\nSome blame the ending separately for the delay, but I think this is absolutely unjustified. In such a large-scale epic, there cannot be a quick end, because all the storylines must be closed. And 40 minutes of denouement was not even enough for me personally. The final scene is synonymous with the phrase \"light sadness.\" This is perhaps the only fictional universe on the screen that I really really did not want to say goodbye. Yes, I would generally watch these films for ages, if there was such an opportunity.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings is truly great. This one definitely deserves the status of a cult classic. I give the highest score to each film and the entire trilogy as a whole! Unconditional masterpieces!",

            "content": "It was utter torture getting through this trilogy as although I understand they are some of the most beloved films to come out of the 2000s I just couldn't get into the fantasy and the characters. I only really watched the films so that I could see every Best Picture winner ever and I must say I was not looking forward to watching this one. I enjoyed parts of the first film in the series but by the point at which I watched this I was tired of the hairy feet and the bad slapstick humor. I just can't believe that the Academy would reward a film like this and when looking at 2003 and considering the fact that the fantastic Lost in Translation (2003) was also nominated it is a travesty that this muddled mess won. I wouldn't tell anybody who doesn't already love the books and doesn't require character development or an understandable plot to ever watch this.\n\nMerry, Dominic Monaghan, and Pippin, Billy Boyd, are reunited with Aragorn while Gollum, Andy Serkis, continues in his plan to betray Frodo, Elijah Wood, and Sam, Sean Astin. Then Frodo manages to escape from Gollum when he discovers he is evil and Arwen, Liv Tyler starts dying. A bunch of battles happen and then the One Ring finally gets destroyed as Gollum is thrown into the fires of Mount Doom while he holds it. Aragorn becomes king, everybody is happy and they all bow to the 4 hobbits.\n\nMy head hurts just thinking about this film and all of the things that occur seemingly for no reason as we interact with people who have reactions and motivations that don't seem vaguely understandable. I needed something, something to care about and this film gave me nothing. The ring is evil and must be destroyed so that Sauron can't take over the world but why do we spend so much time getting to Mount Doom and why do there have to be so many extraneous plot elements. The same screenwriting team worked on this film as all the others and they seem to have abandoned all attempts to humanize the characters and explain the plot developments. Those were the only reasons that I liked The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) and with a complete absence of that in this film I really couldn't connect.\n\nAs with the first two films the visuals were dazzling and I have no criticisms of the special effects used and everything looks beautiful. Unfortunately these visuals weren't in service of a great or even coherent story. Films like Blade Runner (1982) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) use gorgeous visuals to draw you into dark stories that comment on our place in the world as humans and our relationship to technology, this film has none of that depth. Why couldn't Peter Jackson who made a great film in Heavenly Creatures (1994) explore something deeper than good vs. evil over a lethargically paced 2 hours and 40 minutes.\n\nLiterally the only moment that shook me out of my stupor was the kiss at the end but that was my lizard brain talking as I had been thinking about how great The Bridges of Madison County (1995) was instead of torturing myself with this movie. Had any of the female characters had more screen time, we see Arwen have a vision of Aragorn and her son and at the end she is Aragorn's prize, maybe I could have engaged. Eowyn technically carries out an important action but we don't really spend any time with her and Otto and the lesser actress Tyler get nothing to work with. Oh my, Lost in Translation is a better written and directed film than this.\n\nThis may be the worst Best Picture winner ever, I'm serious it's worse than Gandhi (1982) and The Broadway Melody (1929). At this point I'm seriously annoyed that this is a thing that even exists, let the fans have their books but don't inflict an entire series of films on the human race. Don't see this unless you absolutely hate yourself because it's a real chore to get through and you are left with nothing at the end of it.",
