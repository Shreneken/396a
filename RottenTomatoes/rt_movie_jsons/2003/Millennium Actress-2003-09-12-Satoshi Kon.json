    "summary": "In this animated movie, filmmaker Genya Tachibana begins work on a documentary about famed Japanese actress Chiyoko Fujiwara. Now well into old age, Chiyoko has become reclusive and shy about any publicity, but she eventually warms up to Tachibana and starts to relate her life story. As the decades pass, Chiyoko is transformed from a teen with big dreams into a full-blown celebrity, while her cinematic characters span various eras, from ancient Japan to the distant future.",

If it was a book, I'd say there's nothing keeping you turning the pages. The story is slow-paced and very bare-bones. The only things I like about it are the beautiful art and the blurring lines between fiction/reality or between different identities.",

Its not so much a film aimed at young kids and I liked the plot concept of travelling through different times in a persons life, to see what they saw and witness events first hand. I thought the old fashioned, video game type music played at times was somehow endearing - it has quite a strong sense of nostalgia. It's not as great as Tokyo Godfathers (it features the same director) but its certainly worth a watch regardless if your into anime films and so I would recommend it, yes.",

            "content": "Satoshi Kon brings his trademark blend of reality and fantasy to the premise of growth and memory, tracing the career and personal longing of an aging actress through a rich variety of settings and in particular reflecting on the relationships that audiences have with film. \n\nWhile Millennium Actress is a well-designed and creative film, interweaving the personal and professional experiences of a main character in a way that is both visually vibrant and narratively solid, it feels at time as if it casts too wide a net in its emotional range, hinging key moments on somewhat underdeveloped side character and introducing a range of potential themes only to let a couple feel unfinished. But at its core the film is still an emotionally charged take on emotional evolution, featuring a main character that has fixed upon a seemingly unreachable goal as her internal motivation before coming to terms with her own desires fueling the seemingly ill-fated search for a man she met decades ago, extracting the image of herself on the screen from her own aging self in the process. At a budget of only about $1.2m, it's a wonder that Kon was able to deliver not only visuals of this quality but an exceptional soundtrack to support it. \n\nI don't think it packs the whallop that Kon's other work does, but there's still plenty to recommend this work to even a casual viewer; the comic relief is used liberally and works surprisingly well. (3.5/5)",

There are countless times where I imagined myself playing that character from that movie. This is why I absolutely adored this blend of narration by Satoshi Kon. \n\nIt's his 2nd movie, and I can see how masterful he is at mixing two different elements in such elegant and smooth way. The transition between scenes of different movies was phenomenal and dynamic. I love how the interviewer character changed himself into different characters and re-enact the scenes. It's exactly how movies are for audiences.\n\nThe heartbreaking story of this movie was also investing. The symbol of the key and her unrelenting love got me pretty sad at the end. \n\nOverall, I absolutely enjoyed the eye-opening and beautiful storytelling. 8.5-9/10",

The highlights are the smooth transitions between different scenarios and the colour palette, especially in the two main sidekicks (the reporter and the camera operator, who are hilarious, each in their own way).  Chiyoko's journey is fantastic. It's simple and impossible at the same time, original, thrilling, and above everything, very immersive; it's almost Am\u00e9lie Poulain's journey but completely different. And the ending is a punch in the stomach; it's courageous and touches on a theme that always makes me drop some tears. 2001 was amazing for Japanese animation. Alongside Hayao Miyazaki's \"Spirited Away\", \"Millenium Actress\" is one of the best animated films of all time.",

It's a great movie about immature love and how many people, usually girls, get obsessed with the thrill of \"the chase\" VS real love where you actually know, accept, and unconditionally care about someone.\n\nAbout the voice acting. NOW (in the 2000s) all the voice actors are extremely annoying with their overdone hyperbole voice acting. Overlyemotional and RIDICULOUS in everything from My Hero Academia to Demon Slayer. It's really quite irritating.\n\nIn this movie the voice actors are more natural and restrained. Nice voice acting.\n\nI'm not sure if I'd say it's a another Satoshi Kohn masterpiece as I really like Perfect Blue But it pretty good compared with a unique premise.\n\nGREAT for anyone into making movies as it's about an actress, cameraman, and an interviewer/huge fan. It's about a love, the film industry, and just life.\n\nBig emphasis on immature love and being enthralled with \"the chase\" VS real love. The main character chases what she wrongly sees as \"love\" until her death sadly. MOVE ON DUH lol",

            "content": "Ever wondered why does a well-told love story always work in every movie regardless of its genre? Be it a shoot-'em-up actioner, a swashbuckling fantasy, an alien-invasion sci-fi or a cowboy western, nothing can prove a constraint to the power of love in cinema. For love thrives in cinema. It has the ability to ground the most wild and fanciful stories in reality because it evokes emotion in such a way the viewer comes to identify with the characters and invest in the story readily. Satoshi Kon captures that notion here to perfection, blurring the logical line between reality and fiction, forcing us to completely rely on what we feel as we're letting the movie wash over us.\n\n\"The Key\" is a catalyst that opened the flood-gates of memories of the eponymous actress, letting these memories rush out in flashback scenes the two documentarians interviewing Chiyoko are literally pulled into them. The cheekily innovative way of making them intervene in her quasi-fictional stories added a sense of meta and light relief that imbued the film with much needed breeziness. In addition, that made us pry to Chiyoko's both inner and outer feelings throughout her cinematic and love-pursuing journey. That said, Millennium Actress perhaps runs too short to make a lasting impact on me, and the frenetic pace doesn't help either. I'm sure, however, that a rewatch can make me pump my rating up.\n\n\"I can't remember!\n\nNot even his face!\n\nI loved him so much.\n\nNow I can't remember his face!\"\n\nThe story moulds the agonizing feelings of longing in memory vessels that would preserve love so long as youthfulness lasts. But youthfulness withers, allowing memories to fade away. Here comes the struggle that's even harder than the life-time seeking of love: the struggle of desperately trying to hold onto memories of lost love while your aging mind failing you. That's when you even fail to lament your most precious loss! The story here takes a huge metaphysical leap to emphasize the immortality of love and cinema.",

            "content": "A genius commentary on celebrity, cinema, and romance.\n\nSatoshi Kon's romance drama anime Millennium Actress (2001) is a daring foray into experimental filmmaking as Kon blends a director making a documentary about a retired reclusive actress' life with her life story told through her filmography. Millennium Actress is basically an anime biopic. Though Kon's actress is made up, her story is practically the life of legendary Japanese actress Setsuko Hara, of Yasujir\u014d Ozu's films Late Spring (1949) and Tokyo Story (1953) fame. \n\nI found Millennium Actress fascinating and entertaining with Kon's silly surrealist sense of humor, even when I had no idea what was happening. He throws you right into the narrative with no clues or context, but that helps his surreal direction and dreamy tone. It is a romantic film all about the romantic chase, not so much the relationship itself. I think Satoshi Kon's groundbreaking direction alongside his meta framed narrative of her fairy tale life told in a documentary within Kon's actual picture is pretty cool. I just know I'll be thinking about this one for days. In time, I'd say Millennium Actress might rival Satoshi Kon's anime masterpiece Perfect Blue.\n\nSatoshi Kon and Sadayuki Murai's writing is pure art as Kon finds the heart of what makes young girls fall in love. Indeed, Millennium Actress is a romance drama without a real romance, but rather it ruminates on the very concept of love and appreciation of your significant other. It is a brilliant film and an impressive filmmaking achievement. Satoshi Terauchi's editing is the main star here as he splices together numerous film styles with a quick pace for Millennium Actress' brisk 87 minutes. His montage in the finale set to the enthralling theme song, \"Run\" is astounding editing skill. His cuts are so swift, you may not even notice a scene switched to another setting.\n\nHisao Shirai's cinematography is beautiful with chaotic wide shots focusing on the lead actress to always keep the audience engaged. I love every close-up and long panning shot during the running segments. Nobutaka Ike's art direction blends old samurai films like Akira Kurosawa with other Japanese movie genres like romance dramas, Godzilla, and sci-fi features. Takeshi Honda's special effects are dazzling with insane animation. Millennium Actress' colorful style that shifts depending on the genre we are seeing is really creative. All the character designs are really great!\n\nSusumu Hirasawa's score is gorgeous with large swells of symphonic orchestration that help you feel emotional about all of these romantic scenes. All the music in Millennium Actress is captivating in every second. It creates an air of excitement for sure. \n\nMiyoko Shoji's voice as the elderly Chiyoko is very pleasant to hear narrate Millennium Actress. Mami Koyama's voice for the grown up Chiyoko Fujiwara is lovely and endearing. Fumiko Orikasa's voice is adorable as the younger Chiyoko. Shozo Iizuka's voice for the documentary director Genya Tachibana is very friendly and fun. His plump character is quite endearing as he's just a sincere fan of this actress as his subject.\n\nMasaya Onosaka's goofy voice fits cameraman Kyouji Ida very nicely. Showko Tsuda is excellent as the stern and eternally jealous actress Eiko Shimao.\n\nIn conclusion, Millennium Actress is a beautiful picture from a visionary director that I really enjoyed. I think most people would like this movie if you just try to understand all the chaotic choices from Satoshi Kon. May he rest in paradise for all his services to the world of anime and directing.",

            "content": "This is literally my favorite movie, had me in tears the first time I saw it and it still gets me emotional. The story is about the life and career of Chiyoko Fujiwara, a fictional Japanese actress who is being interviewed by Genya Tachibana and his filming assistant. Genya, a deep admirer of hers, returns a key that she had lost long ago, something that she held close at all times. Seeing the key, she tells Genya what it's for and recalls her incredible life's story and the key to it all. The movie then begins as Genya and his assistant are thrust into every flashback of her life, filming and watching as everything unfolds. As her real life events and the films she starred in unfold before us, events begin to blur together in what can only be described as the interwoven threads of love, time, reincarnation and fate weave together to form a tapestry that is Chiyoko's story and how they are all tied together.\n\nThe new Blu-ray version that came out in 2019 was done by a different company than the original 2001 release and is NOT recommended. The translation is poorly done and the subtitles are rife with SERIOUS grammar and spelling errors. I mean it is REALLY BAD!

            "content": "Satoshi Kon's directorial follow-up to Perfect Blue is a somewhat lighter, less enveloping picture. We tail a pair of DIY documentarians, enamored with their subject, as they suss out the location of a reclusive former starlet and entice her to share her life's story. Truth and fiction intertwine in the telling of that particular saga, with personal memoirs stirred into various scenes from her best-loved screen performances. The result is a flighty, dreamlike atmosphere, a general easing in and out of the present that doesn't always follow a linear train of thought. It operates with a soft touch, which matches the understated nature of our aging narrator; smoothly straddling genres and decades en route to a destined meeting with a lost love.\n\nThat puts it on common thematic ground with both Perfect Blue and Paprika (Kon's 2006 swan song), which both toyed with perception and the meeting ground between internal and external realities. Millennium Actress, though, approaches the subject with reduced color and vigor, leaving less dangling threads to captivate audiences and fewer cornerstone visual showpieces to linger in their memories.",

It is film about the making of a film about the making of a film star told through the films she has made which themselves reflect her life: In effect, such recursion eradicates any semblance of a fourth wall, as you're rarely sure of which reality you're watching, and like the director of the framing documentary, feel yourself implicated in stories as the audience for whom they are performed. At the heart of this ouroboric tangle is a paradigmatic objet a that drives the titular character: Chiyoko holds a key\u2014to what she does not know, but she has promised to return the lost object to its proper place, and so feels compelled to find its missing lock and the man who, in a primal private scene, told her that the key unlocked \"the most important thing there is.\" Perhaps, however, that does not mean any specific, singular keyway, no particular treasure chest or secret chamber to unlock; rather, as Chiyoko acknowledges at the end of her life, the end of her career, the end of her search, the end of the millennium, and the end of the film\u2014which, shot for shot, is also the beginning of the movie\u2014the key, having been lost a second time and returned to her by the director, has \"opened the door to [the] memories\" that we have just been watching, movies being a medium of remembering moments lost in time but captured in light.\n",

What it becomes is a fascinating film where the reporter and his cameraman enter her memories and experience them first hand. At the same time all the plot lines of her past movie roles converge on a central theme that link back to a specific event in her life. It\u2019s a non-linear film that can get quite confusing as you are left to question what part of it came from real events in her life, and what part was fiction from her movies. This kind of muddled storytelling is often frustrating for me, because it can be hard to get my bearings and figure out what is happening and how it all fits together. Despite my reservations, I found Millennium Actress to be a magical experience. There\u2019s something enchanting about the way the story unfolds, and seeing it all through the lens of a man who practically worships the main character helped me to become invested. The different films that Chiyoko starred in were a diverse mix so it kept changing the tone as the film progressed. Then, once all the settings were established, they were able to bounce around from one to the next in order to keep things interesting. It all fit together beautifully, and I was fascinated to see how it would all tie together by the end. The resolution is perfect and almost brought me to tears. Millennium Actress is the kind of film that I need to watch multiple times in order to appreciate all the nuance they included in the story, but even the first time through it was a delightful film that I found thoroughly charming. I cannot wait to explore it more.",

The driving premise is a romance so thin and melodramatic that it shades heavily into obsession, mirrored by the framing filmmaker's obsession with the titular actress. Kon seems so focused on the twists and layers of his plot and how he can move between them and blur them that he doesn't spend much time giving any weight or depth to the characters. That's kind of a shame just because I think the premise isn't inherently unemotional. It's a postmodernist (yay) dissection of the narratives we apply to our lives, and a director as smart as Kon should have been able to apply that theme to someone with a narrative a bit more realistic and compelling.",

If after the first half hour, you're still not sure what the hell is going on - what's real and what's symbolic, then don't worry, this, I think, is normal.

Such animated films tackle more complex subjects of war, politics, psychology of a person, and among other that otherwise wouldn't be played down for a family film. Millennium Actress is one of those multi-layered work of animation that will move if you only see the surface, but further analyze everything holds a greater meaning.\r\n\r\nMillennium Actress follows a TV interviewer and his cameraman meeting a former actress and travel through her memories and career. The film narrative structure covers an entire actress life told in non-linear flashbacks relentless pursuit for her significant other. In writing that story structure does not sound deep, but in execution cover many subjects it touches on. It's as much a character study as it is a an expression on endlessly pursuing idealized desire. Each flashback involves the actress merging real life memories with those in films she starred in. As such seeing her in various characters and costumes, in different genres set in different eras, like the Samurai films, science fiction, romance dramas, and even monster movies to symbolize a human backdrop of desire. Such desires ranges from wanting to make a difference against your government restrictions, the length of protection of something held precious no matter the danger, and the ever need to a fill a gap. These emotions are relatable, but underneath it emotional study lies a subtle showing of the political policy in each era. We experience life through Japanese occupation of Manchuria through the post war era going in hand merging fiction and reality. All these memories are open to interpretation as well as serving in depth characteristic in understanding our main character. You'll analyze everything from her personality, why she think low of herself, and the true significance of her pursuit. Though this one character does touch on many subjects, but sadly secondary characters are reduced to being archetypes. Either comedic relief or explaining everything the secondary characters just disappear into the background with barely anything to contribute outside of their one picked role.\r\n\r\nThe animation is primarily minimal in movement with the only time the animation becomes exaggerated is for significant plot point to be highlighted surrealistically. Art direction and technique varied in bringing different eras of Japanese history together and seamlessly transitioning to one era to another. All the backgrounds are detailed and textured. Character design is accordingly appealing, especially the depiction of protagonist Chiyoko through various stages of her life that delineates dignity and purity. Chiyoko itself transcends to some abstract form of ideal love, only unrequited, and therefore allegorically portrayed in her various film roles. Music is electronically assembled with a lot of repetition. It sometimes stands out as a bit overbearing and idiosyncratic, yet considering the nature of theme from the film it does not detract from the overall viewing experience. Voice acting is strong whether in its original Japanese recording which has three voice talent for Chiyoko character in her different age or a dubbed version almost matching the Japanese voice talent.\r\n\r\nMillennium Actress is a alternatively rewarding complex film with a vividly detail art style to go with it. Visually stunning, emotionally gripping, and thoughtfully challenging makes Millennium Actress a true work of genius in animation.",

The animation is incredible, and so is the music. The plot is very high paced and intense, with transitions from Chiyoko's movies to her life all the time, which can be confusing at first but it doesn't really matter when you realize that it's supposed to be that way, to show how movies in which she acted are in fact a reflection of her pursuit. It uses very cleverly its symbols like the key, the earthquakes, and the old woman with the spinning wheel, all of them serving a purpose like being a motive and an excuse for her chase, or marking important things that happened in her life. This movie is an insight of what life is really about, and what is the meaning of chasing something you want.

I myself really identified with the seamless blend of Chiyoko's 'real' life with her roles; it gets a little hard to differentiate between the true events and her movies, but that of course, is the point. It's all been her life, and those experiences are just as truthful to her as the 'actual' ones. It's really quite beautiful. The characters, as always with Kon, are so interesting and distinct.

The animation is great which makes it more fun to watch. Satoshi Kon rarely fails me and this film is proof because he never strays too far and does his best to perfectly show you the entire film. After watching Millennium Actress, I just felt so damn good. The film is painted with emotion and it almost strangles you but it doesn't hurt. With almost 90 minutes for its running time, I don't think that it is enough because it left me wanting more despite the fact that it is impossible to go on. I feel like it wasn't enough.

            "content": "One of Satoshi Kon's best. Less Perfect Blue and Paprika, more in line with Tokyo Godfathers with an injection of surreality.\n\nThe entire cast turns strong performances, as you'd expect in a Kon film - he accepted nothing less. And the actresses who portrayed the titular actress, Chiyoko Fujiwara, over the various stages of her life all performed just as they needed to in order to believably capture the same character in different roles and at different stages of her life. Genya and his cameraman rounded things out.\n\nWhere Tokyo Godfathers told a story of people at the very bottom of society, Millennium Actress follows a woman who thrived - though not because she had truly wanted to be an actress - and then withdrew later in life. Where much of Tokyo Godfathers dealt with the suffering characters finding hope, Millennium Actress follows the life of a woman chasing after a shadow that she would likely never catch. Where Tokyo Godfathers, Paprika, and Perfect Blue took place in modern Japan, Millennium Actress spends much of its time in the 1950s and the surrounding decades, the impact of World War II central to Chiyoko's story as she attempts to catch up with the anti-government activist painter whom a brief encounter with dramatically changed her life. Some knowledge of Japanese WWII history can only enrich your experience with the film, understanding exactly who was fighting for what within the country, and to understand what is being shown in the brief firebombing scene - aspects I could see some American viewers being less than well educated about. Where Tokyo Godfathers and Perfect Blue were more grounded in reality and Paprika later focused on the incredible, surrealist landscape of dreams, Millennium Actress crashes the past and conveniently plot-related movie clips together with the present, even taking some meta turns as Genya began to insert himself directly into the scenes from Chiyoko's films. This makes for a story presentation much unlike any I've ever seen before.\n\nKon's direction was spot on the whole way through, though the initial leap back into a film clip may jar some viewers - you'll grow more accustomed to it as you get a feel for the film's unusual flow. Susumu Hirasawa's original score is excellent, as he can always be counted on in his collaborations with Kon, and in this case, he's unusually restrained with far less energetic electronic songs than usual. Where they do appear, they fit well. Millennium Actress tells a story of a woman of great strength, and it's both happy and sad, as turbulent and challenging a life story as it is. Viewers' mileage will vary with Millennium Actress - as always, in part due to the fact that it's an anime film - but the film is ultimately a testament to the tremendous talent we lost when Satoshi Kon passed away from pancreatic cancer last August. Considering some of the later scenes in this film, I do have to wonder how he faced his final days, outside of the words he left behind.",
