The Toymaker has captured Juni's sister, OSS agent Carmen (Alexa Vega), and is holding her inside a virtual reality environment called \"Game Over.\" Now Juni must use his cunning to advance to the nearly impossible \"Level Five\" in order to rescue his sister.",

            "content": "Wow…The ending was such…a whole lot of nothing and as anticlimactic as you get. That alone was such a letdown. The acting isn't that good. Juni is better here than 2 and this is probably his best performance of the trilogy but that's not saying much. I don't know who thought casting Stallone was a good idea but he is terrible. The new kids are boring, forgettable, not well acted half the time, and I believe this love story LESS than Attack of the Clones. The cinematography isn't good either. The creativity of the first 2 especially the first is barely here. The worlds feel very lifeless and don't look like a Spy Kids film but a cheap video game that's out of place. The special effects are sometimes creative but are weighed down by the stupid 3D effects that get in the way. the music isn't that good and feels like a watered down version of the first 2. The editing isn't good and the pacing is bad. This feels like a kid version of Tron mixed with a Spy Kids film and it never makes them work together. I don't know if its the story or the 3D effects or maybe a bit of both that weighs it down. And the ending is terrible, and makes you feel like you wasted your time on top of being anticlimactic. I can't say I was ever bored watching this but I never really enjoyed it like the first 2. Even the second I had parts I thought was creative and kind of cool now and again. I never had that once here. Skip This regardless if you have the 3D glasses.",

The inclusion of big celebrities that kids won't recognize is a little odd, but the in your face 3-d stuff is irritating, and there were several forced scenes, and a conflicting message of competition vs cooperation.\n\nThere are really high points of the movie: the story line itself is actually pretty good, the robot battle detour was actually a fun way to set up a call back, and there is a really good, if short, twist that I wouldn't expect in a kid's movie.\n\nThe last act was a little too insane for me, but I'm thinks kids might like it.",

            "content": "If Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over is, in fact, the end of the Spy Kids movies, it's just about the most anti-climactic end to a series ever. Where the first two films were fun and enjoyable, Spy Kids 3-D is overbearing and obnoxious. The film makes the fatal mistake of utilizing 3-D technology that just doesn't work (it's those old red-and-blue glasses that should've been made obsolete in the '50s), and effectively infuriates those in the audience over the age of twelve.\n\nIn a prologue that's mercifully not in 3-D, we learn that Juni Cortez (Daryl Sabara) has abandoned the Spy Kid lifestyle in favor of detective work (he couldn't handle the pressure that comes with being a spy, apparently). But when his sister Carmen (Alexa Vega) is kidnapped and held hostage inside a cheesy video game, Juni has to pick up where he left off and venture inside the game to save her.\n\nThat simplistic storyline is a big part of why Spy Kids 3-D fails as horribly as it does. The teamwork aspect of the first two films, between Carmen and Juni, is almost completely absent here. And that was a big part of what made those films as entertaining as they were: the idea that this squabbling pair of siblings had to work together to solve a variety of complex and clever puzzles. Here, the majority of the film is akin to watching someone else play a video game, as Juni gets into car chases, fights robots, etc. With hardly a whiff of a plot to keep things moving, this becomes incredibly tedious almost immediately. While the special effects are admittedly quite impressive, they'd be more at home in an arcade.\n\nAnd then, of course, there's the 3-D aspect of the movie. Every single moment of the film that takes place inside the game (which adds up to at least an hour of screentime), is presented using \"the very latest digital technology\" (or so says the press notes) of 3-D effects. But really, this is about as effective as those old William Castle movies of the '50s - and just as annoying. Seeing through these flimsy glasses proves to be the first major test, as the blue portion of the glasses seems to have been tinted a little too darkly. Even if you're able to see properly, you'll immediately notice that supposed 3-D objects barely appear to leave the screen. And it's not like the technology to create effective 3-D images doesn't exist; James Cameron's Ghosts of the Abyss did a superb job of immersing the audience in a realistic-seeming 3-D world. Fortunately, Rodriguez seems to have predicted that most people wouldn't be able to sit through an entire movie wearing the glasses, and the movie is watchable without them. Background images have primarily been \"enhanced,\" meaning it's actually preferable to view the flick without the aid of the glasses.\n\nSpy Kids 3-D will presumably fare a lot better on home video, where the 3-D effects will be removed from the film. But even if that's the case, you'll still have to sit through a terminally dull storyline that makes Tron look like Citizen Kane.",

It's just a cheap way to sell more expensive tickets.  Too many scenes in the movie involve a cheap 3-D thrill.  Not worth it.  3. Can we get better supporting characters?

Anyways, it plays out like a series of Tron events without the neon glow, but tons of bad CGI. The whole film is basically CGI and the effects aren't very good either.

            "content": "For a while I was a Robert Rodriguez fan because of his unusual ability to make films cheap and quick. It wasn't until a decade later, I realized that this is not a good thing.\n\nThe Spy Kids movies feel cheap and rushed. I liked the first two despite their many flaws. This film is just average. \n\nThe biggest problem with this film is that there is no \"Spy\" stuff in it what so ever. It's like a Bond film with no gadgets or espionage. \n\nShot mostly in front of a green screen and most of it is CGI, this becomes irksome. The CG in Rodriguez films is either convincing or just bad. The first two movies had some awful FX, but this one shows off the most. You'll be begging to see real sets. Sure Sin City looks amazing, but that's because you had Frank Miller's source material to make up for it and it was in black and white which works really well.\n\nThe Toymaker is a dreadful villain. He has no motivation. He's just bad for no reason. A problem that all the movies has. \"I'm the villain, nuff said.\"\n\nStallone overacts like crazy. \"This isn't a game. IT'S LIFE!\" And the Razzie goes to...... I'm not kidding, he won the Razzie for this film. He plays 5 roles and he sucks at all of them. Also, how many times does he say the word \"game\" throughout the film. That'll make a nice drinking game. Aargh, now I said it!\n\nWhere's Antonio Banderas? He gets top billing but he only appears at the end. So do the rest of the big names. All shot in front of green screen cos they couldn't make it to the set altogether. \n\nI thought the whole \"everyone is your family\" was useless. Also, when everybody all rushing in to help at the end, how did the get there so fast. Answer: The movie says so. And don't get me started on the \"3D\".\n\nThe movie can be fun at times when you ignore all logic. I like the way the first level of the game is a platformer (or tries to be), the second level is a beat 'em up, the third is a racer, the fourth is a......... well, it's also a fighter and the fifth is a.................. what is the fifth one, strategy?\n\nIt is bright and colourful, the way a family film should be.\n\nIt's a fun film for kids to watch and Ricardo Montalban is watchable. His character gets in the game and gets the chance to walk. I like scene where he's taking to Juni that although he's paralyzed from the waist down \"On the inside, I feel like this.\" Even people who hate the film liked this scene. \n\nI also like the whole \"forgiveness is better than revenge\" theme. At least this movie done something right.\n\nOverall, it's okay. It's a lot better than the fourth film which I haven't seen, but I hear it's horrible.",

From start to finish this feels like a rushed project and a total 3D cash grab. Most of the acting here is even worse here than from the first two and I thought that the acting was just tolerable enough in the past two movies. The film also wastes all the talents of Sylvester Stallone, George Clooney, Antonio Banderas, Danny Trejo, and even Elijah Wood. The script and visuals did not have any thought put into them at all and Playstation 2 game graphics look better than these crappy special effects. The 3D is used badly and is only a gimmick to make it look like pieces of cgi stuff flying at you. Not once did anything look realistic once everybody entered into the gaming world and its just actors and actresses walking around a green screen for an hour. Robert Rodriguez's directing here was just thoughtless and most of some of the heart from the first two movies is gone. The only positives in my opinion with this are that I thought Ricardo Montalban as the Grandfather did a solid job, Sylvester Stallone did just ok as The Toymaker, the subplot between them two I thought was interesting, and this movie wasn't quite as painful and crappy as Sharkboy and Lavagirl.",

Maybe the 3rd one would actually be kind of good. I couldn't have been more wrong.\r\n\r\nLet's start from bad to worst. First of all, there are some major plot holes. In the ending scene, the 2 kids only have about 5 3d glasses that will allow them to see their enemies. But SOMEHOW they are able to give glasses to like 500 people. No, I don't get it either. And why is there nobody in the streets when the robots attack? No civilians, no cops, no dogs nobody. It looks like a modern freaking ghost town!\r\n\r\nThe special affects were bad. And when I say bad I mean baby geniuses bad. They look like something out of the first Tron movie. Maybe it would have been impressive like 40 years ago, but definatley not anymore. \r\n\r\nFinally, we have the acting. Oh, the acting. I have nightmares just thinking about the acting. Daryl Sabara's acting was so overly done, it made Jeremy Irons from Dunegons and Dragons look normal. And that is ESPECIALLY so when a dramatic scene is about to happen. Like when Demetra get's killed, he looks like he just crapped his pants or something. The only person in the movie who had good acting was Elijah Wood, who was in it for like 2 seconds. Yes, Elijah Wood. One of the greatest and most underrated actors in the buisness is in Spy Kids 3D. Let that sink in.\r\n\r\nThen there's the ending. What exactly happens? Well basically, at first it looks cool, like the Grandpa and the bad guy are gonna have a final battle or something, but he really just sees him to FORGIVE HIM!

Not watching it since it was out in theaters I had not remembered the story so it was anew experience and I found out this film is like vomit covered with a blanket. The blanket covers it yeah but you can smell it and if you take off the blanket there's still vomit. The blanket is basically the 3-D and the vomit is the movie. So first off the acting is retched. The 3-D is just a marketing ploy and so that means it is bad. The effects are just unbearable. Nothing good came out good from this film, but hey it is a kids film and children seem to like it. So in the end almost everything is bad in this film, but its a children's film so if you put yourself in that mind set it's some what funny.",

Those kids were horrible actors, they were annoying, and they had bad lines. The story was lame, I mean they're called \"Spy kids\", they don't spy! The only thing that made them spies is that they had a bunch of gadgets. The whole \"guy\" thing was taken right out of The Matrix. I've seen some other Rodriguiz movies and I liked them. But dude, stick with adult movies, cause the kid movie thing ain't working'. I play video games, and that doesn't make the movie any more interesting. The FX were horrible, and my Dad does visual FX, so I know a thing or two about that stuff. All in all, if you haven't seen this movie, don't see it.",

Although it has a slight red and green tint on the screen, the actual effects used for it are quiet impressive and really provides the most fun for the film. Out of watching it in 3D or 2D, the preferred choice would be to watch it in 3D, as certain effects are too obvious in 2D. The process of going 3D is successful, but unfortunately, the film really fails on the story. The film is more of a chance to have 3D effects. It starts off ok, with a slight story appearing, but once you get to the last 30 minutes, it drops drastically. Instead of producing a fantastic ending, it just provides a chance to deliver cameos from nearly all the lead stars of the first two films. Even though it?s a joy to see all these stars appearing, it is a really unnecessary move and does not give the proper ending it should have had. Fans of the film would love the final instalment of the trilogy.",
