The town is two-faced and offers to harbor Grace as long as she can make it worth their effort, so Grace works hard under the employ of various townspeople to win their favor. Tensions flare, however, and Grace's status as a helpless outsider provokes vicious contempt and abuse from the citizens of Dogville.",

When Grace (Nicole Kidman), seemingly a fugitive, appears, the inhabitants are shaken by her presence and forced to examine their values.  Von Trier shot the film on a singular soundstage with the bare minimum of props, presumably to allow the audience to focus on the acting and storyline instead of the potential distractions of the visuals.  While the acting and the message that the movie imparts are powerful, von Trier's trickery may actually detract from the film's impact as the audience will likely spend more time looking for the outlines of the gooseberry bushes and the dog rather than focusing on the actual story and all that it has to offer.  Clocking in at close to three hours, the whole thing may be a bit of a slog for some, but those who are patient may find it a rewarding experience.",

I read that ‘The bare staging serves to focus the audience's attention on the acting and storytelling, and also reminds them of the film's artificiality'. However, for me it had the exact opposite affect. I found this ‘stage play' filmed in a studio to be totally artificial, actually drawing my attention away from the acting/storytelling.

            "content": "Lars von Trier's Dogville (2003) offers us an alternative interpretation to the mystery of the incarnation than what Christianity has traditionally come to understand in Christ's humanization. Instead of the possibility of salvation, Dogville suggests Christ's incarnation as the possibility of a universal condemnation. The story of God-becoming-man remains more or less the same; yet the conclusion reached is radically different. It is for this reason that we could say, without any exaggeration, that Dogville's revision of the Gospel, by turning the \"good news\" of Christianity into a message of destruction, constitutes a masterful and perhaps the most serious threat articulated against Christianity up to today- all the more so, since it does so by following, as faithfully as possible, the main theological tenets of the incarnation.\n\nDogville seems to be a witty anagram for \"Godville\"- the village of God. The fact, however, that the letters are put in reverse order might also indicate a God-less town. The only church in Dogville, a mission house, has never had a priest or a service. As Tom Edison Jr. says, \"we can be spiritual without singing or reading from the Bible.\" In fact, the Mission House serves only as the location of his morally edifying lectures. If there is any religion in Dogville, that is only a religion \"within the limits of reason alone.\" Dogville, nevertheless, could also allude to \"Moses,\" the dog in Dogville, the only creature that survives the town's utter destruction; perhaps further evidence that religion here is limited only to the form of the moral imperative as in the Mosaic law. At the end of the film, Grace's father refers to the inhabitants of Dogville as \"dogs\" that \"lick their own vomit\" (alluding to 2 Peter 2:22). The device employed by the director, such that in Dogville everything and everyone is always visible, since the walls of the houses and quite everything else is, in the eyes of the viewer, transparent, suggests a point of view that could be afforded only by God. The people of the village make a living by gathering and selling apples. The allusion here seems to be to the apple in the Garden of Eden- Dogville is an Edenic, post-lapsarian, town: living on temptation and living out temptation.\n\nIn that village, Grace appears as if she had fallen from heavens. The narrator says that Grace has come to Dogville as \"a generous gift\"- in fact, her name, Grace, means a gift (in theological language, grace is given as God's gift). Upon her mysterious arrival, she is recognized only by Moses, whose bark indicated that he was \"face to face with a force to be taken seriously.\" The first thing that Grace does upon her arrival is to steal Moses' bone, a suggestion, perhaps, of how the coming of grace signaled the passing of the Mosaic law. Grace herself says that she has \"no family, only a father.\" A father, she adds, whose face she has seen. She is the only one who has seen her Father's face. Grace leaves the \"city\" where she was with her Father, and she comes to Dogville only to be treated as a slave. In the language of the Scripture: \"being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, but made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to death- even death on a cross!\" (Phil. 2:6-8). The music more closely associated with Grace's arrival- as well as a sequence of other important moments in Grace's life in Dogville- is always the same: the opening phrase from Pergolesi's Stabat Mater and Vivaldi's setting of Psalm 127 (Nisi Dominus). Both pieces betrayed the unmistakably religious, even liturgical, overtones that underlie the narration of Grace's passion-story, namely the exploitation and abuse she suffered at the hands of the \"good people\" of Dogville.\n\nThe first person that Grace meets in Dogville is Tom Edison Jr. His name of course is suggestive. He becomes Grace's supporter, advocate, and liaison with the village. Tom sees Grace's arrival as a unique opportunity for a pedagogical \"illustration\" for Dogville's need to learn how to receive and to accept. Tom Edison is something of a moral teacher for the town, a writer who never wrote anything except \"great and small?\" He is, in other words, a thinker who did not go further than the paradox and, therefore, unable, as we shall see, to understand the paradox that Grace is. His first words in the film are about what is \"useful.\" We hear him speaking in a series of clichés (e.g., \"it is the soil that gave us all life\") that suggest a thought constrained by naturalism. But above all, he is a rationalist. He reasons about everything to the point that he is unable to act, like Hamlet in Shakespeare's play, even when a course of action becomes urgent and necessary. He is in love with Grace, if, indeed, he is capable of loving, yet he is unable to let Grace know of his feelings. In fact, the storyline of Dogville suggests that he is unable to love Grace (the particular person), for he values too much the universal, his own ideas. He watches silently as Grace is abused by each and every of his fellow citizens, unable to act, since he can only think. The only action he finally undertakes, as soon as he realizes that Grace poses a danger for his \"moral mission\" and \"career\" as a writer and thinker, is to betray Grace.\n\nIt is him who also comes up with the idea of Grace making her \"gifts\" available to the families of Dogville as a way of assimilating Grace in the everyday life of Dogville. So, Grace- according to Tom's plan- begins working for one hour for each of the eight families that live in Dogville. That amounts to a regular eight-hour workload per day. It is ironic, however, that Grace should perform chores that the people of Dogville, as they admit, don't \"need.\" In return, Grace is to receive wages- thereby, inscribing the gratuitous \"grace\" of Grace into an economy that turns gifts freely given into products or services. It is the law of the marketplace that prevails here: a quid pro quo. At the end, her presence in Dogville becomes \"more costly,\" as Tom Edison puts it, speaking \"from a business perspective\" and, therefore, she has to work twice as much earning half the pay. Grace becomes the eyes to the blind man in the village, the leg to the crippled, and an extra pair of hands for everyone.\n\nSoon, however, things change. Every single person abuses Grace, either physically (labor, rape), or psychologically (blackmailing, accusations, threats, etc.). Ultimately, Dogville will turn Grace, this heaven-sent gift, into a slave and a prostitute. As the film progresses we witness how the town of Dogville, a symbol of whole of humanity, commits one after another despicable acts of mistrust, greed, and hypocrisy. At the end, the village has appropriated Grace; they have turned a gift into a property that they now own and refuse to let go. She cannot escape Dogville. She becomes, quite literally, a slave and a prisoner of the \"good people\" of Dogville.\n\nThis seems to be the central question of the film: are the people of Dogville good after all? In the first town-meeting they boast saying that they are \"good people,\" \"knowing each other,\" \"caring for human beings.\" In addition to Tom (the rationalist and moralist), we meet Vera with seven children, all of whom bear pagan names; she is an enlightened humanist (on the blackboard in her house one reads the words \"Eros→Psyche\") who, however, is capable of afflicting the cruelest punishment on Grace. We also meet her hard-working husband; the cheerful black cleaning lady with her crippled daughter; the good housekeeper; the naively religious adherent and so on. All simple, average, everyday people, as it would seem. And yet, if Dogville has a point this seems to be that, given the chance, poor people, people in need and misery can be- in fact, they will be- as mean and vicious as any other. That goodness is nowhere to be found- neither in the moralist, nor in the humanist, not even in the child. Each one of them (and in them we all recognize ourselves) becomes the very face of evil. Of course, they are evil in a very \"humane\" way for they reason- is rational evil less evil?—and provide excuses for themselves.\n\n\"The Final Illustration\" (or, Grace's Judgment Day): so far Grace has had \"the rare talent of looking ahead and only ahead.\" Her future-oriented outlook, one could indeed say, her eschatological understanding of the people and the town, enables her to see in the gooseberry bushes the fruit that they will bear \"come summer.\" When Tom Edison Jr. introduced his fellow citizens to Grace, he appends each of his introductions with a negative comment. In the eyes of the moralist we are all obviously lacking. It is only Grace who can see them under a forgiving light. The people of Dogville, however, thinking that they could solve their problem with Grace by calling the gangsters and handing her to them, bring upon themselves what they could have never expected. Grace meets her Father again who now asks her to return \"home\" and be \"like her Father,\" \"sharing his power\" and becoming \"conspirator\" (or \"co-spirator\"). Grace accuses her Father of being arrogant, for it is him after all that \"passes judgment.\" The Father argues that it is rather Grace who, in her mercy, exemplifies arrogance for, in refusing to judge them (\"they are human beings,\" as she observes with a compassion that sets her apart from the human nature), considers herself a standard that cannot be imitated. \"Would she have not done the same like them, had she lived under the same circumstance?\" she asks herself. Well, the matter of fact is that she has lived with them, like one of them, in the very same circumstances, if not worse, and she didn't act like one of them. The town undergoes another of these so telling tiny changes of light only now in favor of a present bereft of any future: \"suddenly, you couldn't see the berry that will be there one day but only the thorn that was there right now…\" At this very point, the logic of the incarnation takes an unpredictable turn- if humans can be judged (and indeed, they must), it is precisely because of the incarnation, because God became human and therefore humans have no excuse anymore for their behavior. It is the humanity of Grace that enables her to condemn them- and us- to utter annihilation. Every citizen of Dogville is violently killed and the village itself burnt to the ground.\n\nTrue enough, Grace as a Christ-figure is understood primarily in moral than ontological terms and so Dogville reads like more than a gospel written by Kant or Jefferson. Nevertheless, von Trier's cinematic interpretation of Christianity poses for us the crucial question of the difference between salvation and condemnation. Had the incarnation not taken place, one could have retorted that God could not pass judgment on humanity (does he, after all, know what it means to be a finite, mortal being?). Now, however, that God became man and dwelt among us, a human being in every respect- how could we hope to escape judgment, that is, how could we not be found lacking when compared to him?\n\nDogville's distorted Christology rests upon a messianic figure (Grace) who is without mediation: unlike the Jesus of the Gospels, Grace is not born in Dogville; she has no mother to connect her with the human race and with the history of that race; she does not grow old- rather, she comes, or better yet, she appears (the risk of Docetism) in Dogville without any real connection to its citizens. She dwells in the town and among them, yet she remains other than them, an otherness unmediated and radical. Grace is a Christ without flesh and without history. Dogville tells the story of how the implication of such a messianic figure cannot be anything else than, necessarily, a necessary condemnation. Lars von Trier's Dogville reminds us that the subterranean connection between Kant's morality and sadism might be, indeed, inescapable.\n\nhttps://vinylwriters.com/the-incarnation-as-condemnation-in-lars-von-triers-dogville/",

            "content": "There's a perennial question, about the artist whose choices in their personal life are so unspeakably bad that they contaminate appreciation of their art, that is increasingly relevant (or in the news) today.  However, I'm not sure a distinction can be made when it comes to Lars von Trier, whose choices in the artworks themselves are so questionable, even despicable, that the fact that he might also be a jerk personally seems beside the point.  His latest film at Cannes drove over 100 people out of the theatre because of its extreme violence toward women and children (and this, after he was only just allowed back to the festival when his banishment for appreciating Hitler ended).  His cultivated image is of \"the provocateur\" but he seems more of a poseur to me.  So, why did I give Dogville a chance?  Perhaps because of its reputation as an experimental film, with its sparse warehouse set, representing a small Colorado town with just a few pieces of lumber and some chalk outlines for houses on the floor (think Our Town).  That's about all I knew.  As the film began and I found out that John Hurt narrates the entire film, alternating with some spoken dialogue from the characters, I found it sufficiently intriguing to keep watching.  Nicole Kidman plays a woman, fleeing from mobsters, who takes shelter in the town.  They have a community vote to decide whether to let her stay (after a two week trial where she works for each family to try to impress them).  Of course, she does get to stay but as the mobsters and the police close the dragnet, the \"costs\" of keeping her in the town and the price the townsfolk demand from Kidman increases.  Eventually, Kidman becomes the target of abuse, since she isn't from there.  So, misogyny charges against von Trier are more or less fulfilled (again).  Kidman said she wouldn't work with him again to boot.  And it isn't quite clear where the experiment took us (the viewers) -- some read this as \"anti-American\" (since von Trier refuses to come to the US) and the use of David Bowie's \"Young Americans\" over the ending credits seems to bear this out.  I saw it as a sadistic game of \"chicken\", taunting the audience about just how far he was willing to go (to shock), and a sardonic repudiation of Dogme 95 trying to be as artificial as possible, as if to poke a finger in the eye of anyone who bothered to take him seriously back then (when he issued his philosophical filmmaker's manifesto).  Although there is no denying that he has a certain degree of artistic know-how, let's hope no one bothers to take von Trier seriously again.",

            "content": "Dogville is one of the ultimate feel-bad films I've ever watched and also an intensely challenging drama that doesn't give a damn about your expectations. The story is about a mysterious woman named Grace who seeks refuge in a small Colorado town called Dogville to hide out from gangsters who are searching for her. The townspeople agree to take her in on the condition that she work for them such as a blind man having her describe the sunset, working in the local store, helping take care of an invalid daughter, teaching children, etc. After awhile, Grace is accepted by the townspeople, and grows to love the town itself. However, her happiness is not to last forever as the true natures of the townspeople slowly begin to emerge. It's a harsh, emotionally-crushing film that deals with the ugliest elements of human nature through hypocrisy, lies, violence, and sexual depravity. There will be many who will sneer at this film and call it pretentious and self-indulgent, others will be infuriated by its ugly truths and refusal to cop out (You want happy? You ain't getting it), and others will find it to be a transfixing and challenging drama. As you can see by my rating, I fall into the last category. Dogville is a grim film, but a brilliant film from beginning to end. It's gripping, it's flawlessly acted, it's emotionally devastating, and it will hit you like a kick to the ribs and gut. It's a unique and uncompromising vision that will only have a niche following, but that's among many reasons why I think it's one of the best films of the century. It never takes the easy way out or provides easy answers to its characters or potential viewers - exactly what a drama should be. For that, it's a masterpiece.",

            "content": "Dogville might not be my personal favorite, but I wouldn't argue with anyone who said it it's the best movie ever made. It combined everything I love about the theater with everything great about independent films and foreign films. I have forgotten most of the movies I've watched over the past 17 years but I still remember the first time I watched Dogville and the second time I watched it, with my parents, who were scandalized, but of course very enthralled with the allegorical subject matter. It's very long and minimalist but it's very much anti-imperialist America, which is why I liked it. It's classified as an international film since Lars is Danish, the production companies are multiple countries, and the cast is British / American. The movie got pretty savage reviews by the US media, mostly decrying the fact that it was vitriolic, anti-American and bitter. That was one of my coming-of-age moments when I realized most critics don't know what they're talking about. Since when is passion in art a bad thing?\n\nFew films, outside of the torture porn genre, will fill you with as much righteous fury as Dogville. The film is an exceptional allegory for mankind's gross sins against his own people. As much as we would all like to believe that the film is about man's suffering and the injustice of mob mentality, there is one important point we're all missing. This is about your country! Dogville is the harshest criticism of American values I've ever seen and that is strictly because of its allegorical simplicity and G-rated content. This ambiance makes Lars Von Trier's vitriolic commentary seem like a Disney cartoon on crack. Nicole Kidman's performance is brilliantly naive and yet subtle enough to suggest she doesn't know what the movie's about. (She does...she's an Aussie) The many bizarre cameos by American actors just amaze me. (Sonny Corleone, what were you thinking?) Dogville is a triumph of manic depressive, prejudicial rage.\n\nWhat I Learned: Definitely one of the movies that made me lose faith in humanity. Realizing that your own country is capable of great evil, and that people you trusted are fully capable of exploiting your weakness and your forgiveness, is frightening. I think Dogville is a movie that disillusions you and brings you to a new level of consciousness. Like Kubrick, another influence of mine, I think Lars' voice-his distrust of humanity-is a strong voice in my head I have yet to shake.",

            "content": "Cuando pensamos en que reunir todos los problemas de una decadente sociedad no pueden transmitirse al mismo tiempo en un solo mensaje, pues al parecer puede tratarse de una tarea imposible, Lars von Trier consigue idear un largometraje que recopila todo ello. ¿Quiénes somos realmente?, ¿hacia qué futuro se dirigen los colectivos de occidente?, ¿qué destino nos depara a este ritmo? Von Trier logra contestar todas aquellas incógnitas a través de una obra reveladora de poco más de dos horas: \"Dogville\"\nNarrada a través de una elegante y poética prosa, el personaje de Grace (Nicole Kidman) llega al pequeñísimo poblado de Dogville, huyendo de un grupo de gánsteres, por lo que no tiene otra opción más que alojarse en este lugar, tratando de ganarse la confianza de sus pobladores. Con el tiempo, la aparente amabilidad y gentileza de la población se va transformando hacia algo diferente y muy inesperado. En primer lugar, la película muestra cómo el mal se puede propagar como una plaga en esta comunidad de personas que lucen aceptablemente decentes. \"Dogville\" nunca pretende ser completamente realista, pues las situaciones mostradas se exageran y también se satirizan. Visto hacia un nivel más profundo, la película es una historia increíblemente oscura que habla de la hipocresía humana, las voluntades y deseos secretos, los crímenes indescriptibles, la culpa incapacitante, y la racionalización del egoísmo. Todo esto es meticulosamente elaborado de forma que uno comprenda directamente que se está hablando de la sociedad misma en la que nos desenvolvemos y la cultura e ideologías que arrastramos. Los temas hacen alusión a todos los problemas que afectan a nuestra enferma y decrépita sociedad y a las que no hacemos mucho caso. Peor aún, todo lo negativo que pasa en nuestro mundo se ve como normal y pasa frente a nosotros de forma inadvertida; somos responsables de lo que pasa y la rutinización e indiferencia ante situaciones vinculadas al abuso de mujeres, discriminación, pobreza, aislamiento, entre otras, agravan aún más el contexto propio. \nComo el resto de sus películas, von Trier insiste en que los humanos no somos más que reflejos de nuestro propio ser interno. No importan los discursos ni las ideas que \"firmemente\" se comparten y discuten ante el mundo, pues al final, las reacciones y decisiones responden a nuestras pasiones y emociones más internas que no son más que la parte más animal e instintiva que todos tenemos.\nSin duda esta es también una de las mejores películas nihilistas que se han trabajado en el cine. Normalmente es fácil detectar rasgos antisociales en las películas de este director, pero en este caso su idea del nihilismo es diferente: sus personajes principales no son nihilistas, sino personas íntegras. El problema es que el mundo entero que los rodea es un vacío cruel e injusto. El director crea una compleja trama psicológica y, para enfocarse en ella él quiere mostrar la omnipresente injusticia de los hombres, situación que está presente en toda sociedad y que la hipocresía no merece ninguna salvación. Dogville presenta un mundo demasiado cruel para cualquier liberación y también la perversidad ocasiona una inevitable desmoralización tanto individual como colectiva, eliminando la importancia hacia los valores y hacia las concepciones que disuaden entre el bien y el mal.\nCínicamente, el castigo corporal y la educación moral estricta son temas de ámbito conservador que se sostienen a lo largo de toda la película, recalcando esta idea de la oscura naturaleza humana, surgiendo conclusiones morales que por muy duras que sean, incómodas y preferibles de evitar, son en realidad verdades que deben tomarse en serio. Von Trier también insiste y es muy efectivo y conciso al momento de describir cómo la gente esconde, suprime, y libera sus celos, deseos sexuales, mala voluntad, y su fetiche moral para el castigo de otros. La película retrata las formas de estas acciones de forma precisa y astuta, y a pesar de que exagera la magnitud de los deseos a niveles poco realistas, sí que incitan a una rígida reflexión, pues todo lo presentado son las verdades indeseables de las que siempre preferimos evadir e ignorar. Por ello mucha de la crítica se siente ofendida y rechaza mucha información de \"Dogville\", puesto que no acepta lo que ve y no puede reconocerlo, dejándolo hacia un lado por comodidad. La gran creatividad con la que se crea la historia, los lugares, el guión mismo y el haber utilizado a este elenco, en el que cada personaje encierra un interesante conjunto de características referentes a pecados y al cinismo, son elementos cuya implementación no tienen comparación, pues sin duda nadie más que von Trier pudo haber sido capaz de crear una obra de tal magnitud y poder que trasciende ahora y lo seguirá haciendo por mucho tiempo más.\n95/100",

The fact is that Lars Von Trier tells a story about human nature in a city that is no more risk on the ground in a film that is 3 hours long, impossible? fulsome? silly? no, nothing like that, quite the contrary, the genius of \"Dogville\" is in its simplicity, everything is simple, but everything is extremely technical quality, let's talk about the best thing in the film, the script, which goes in the 30s and tells the story of Grace (Nicole Kidman) who is running away from gansgters and decides to take shelter in Dogville, a town with 15 inhabitants who decides to hide in exchange for favores.E is there that Lars Von Trier makes a study on human evil, showing the extent to which human being is able to act when it has power over the other, and how it takes situations of advantages when you can, benefits those who go this the rapes to simple favors, going to leave Grace chained as a dog, but Lars von Trier also tells us in the final scene that is intrinsic to the human being and to the fact that Grace did not kill the dog is a message for us, because the dog is not evil by nature as human beings. Technically, the file has a otina photograph, although the city does not really exist, all climate change are flagged with perfect care, she spends host and fear at the same time, the picture is good, sound mixing is amazing, because we have doors, windows, or anything, but we have the sounds, and it does that as long you just forget that this city simply does not exist, and the performances are very good, Nicole Kidman is great. I love Dogville, pos despite its three hours he has pace, and has something to say, and is a very intelligent comment, I love the fact that the city does not exist, it goes on the idea that can be any city, I love the story third-person and especially love the theatrical atmosphere of the film, \"Dogville\" is more than a movie, it's a lesson on the human being.",

It is the first movie in director Lars Von Trier's USA: Land of Opportunities series that follows a woman named Grace, portrayed here by Nicole Kidman, as she moves through America experiencing its history and culture. Here, she has somewhat of a backwards Cinderella story as Von Trier strips the idea of a small American town down to its bare essentials.\n\nThe entire film takes place in a black box on a sound stage where the buildings and locations of the town are outlined in chalk on the floor, like a life size map with minimal props around to sell the idea that this is where these citizens live. It's strange for a fully fledged film, but it doesn't take long to get used to, as the story and characters are enticing enough to fill in the gaps for a suspension of belief. Before long, you won't even notice that walls don't hide anything from anyone and the mine at the edge of town isn't just a series of wooden arches.\n\nWith a background that is mostly black, the cinematography is pretty limited to a few interesting lighting effects and pulling focus to the actors at hand. It seems that it would be very fun and freeing for an actor to be able to work with an ensemble cast on a project like this. The ensemble is so filled with great actors that there are too many to name them all, but the chemistry among them is smooth, fitting them together like pieces of a complete puzzle. They all get their moments to shine within the stories that intertwine these households together.\n\nDogville is somehow a convincing combination of several mediums, film, the stage and prose, that could have gone horribly wrong. All three of these mediums have different ways of telling the same story that need to be taken into account when adapting from one to the other, but here, they all work separately and simultaneously together without becoming a jumbled mess. This is like a filmed production of a stage show playing out the actions read from a novel, with John Hurts as the voice of God narrating the actions, thoughts, backgrounds and feelings of all of the characters, which sounds a bit much but actually ends up being simple and lovely.\n\nThough it does still tread that balance of realism and fantasy, this is very different for a film from Lars Von Trier. It is much less involved and simple, in a way, but that lends itself to how Von Trier may be perceiving America, a place the director hasn't really experienced first hand, and it's people who have long been critically harsh and at odds with him. Even still, Dogville manages to be yet another bitter and thought provoking look at life and the struggles we experience.",

Not echoing the satanic elements of \"Twin Peaks\" or the ugliness-under-the-beauty breadth of \"In the Heat of the Night\"'s Sparta, \"Dogville\" would rather take on the old trait that the human race is inherently cruel and violent, despite an initially hospitable facsimile.\n\tVon Trier, the most controversial director of the 2000s (sorry Tom Six), doesn't make such a bold claim with outright magnification; he takes nearly three hours to build upon the suggestion, mounting and mounting until the thought becomes dreadfully exaggerated.  And, in a polarizing method of story amplification, sets are not sets but chalky squares on a soundstage, given identity through minimalist props and map-like text designating the area (the main road is stamped \"Elm St.).  For most, \"Dogville\"'s austere texture will be off-putting.  Its complete lack of a structural \"setting\" and its epic running-time are attributes easier to leave than to take.\nI, perhaps in the minority, don't just appreciate von Trier's daring filmmaking approach here; I applaud it.  It works.  It's thrilling.  \"Dogville\" dawdles at times, and it is especially difficult to avoid clock-watching after the second hour, but impressive is the way that von Trier manages to pull off a film so stylistically eyebrow raising.  We are only distracted by its design for the first few minutes; the screenplay, so strong in its ideas and dialogue, gives the environment a three-dimensional shape.  Thought-provoking and thoroughly one-of-a-kind, this is a film you won't be forgetting any time soon.\nSet during The Great Depression, \"Dogville\" follows Grace (Nicole Kidman), a woman on the run from gangsters.  Fleeing the law, she stumbles upon Dogville, a miniature Rocky Mountain town with a population so small it is nearly familial.  Tight-knit and untrusting of outsiders, the citizens are unsure of whether to accept Grace into their community.  It is eventually decided, through Tom (Paul Bettany), the self-appointed spokesman of the public, that Grace can stay as long as she makes herself useful, acting as a maid for anyone who asks.  People are reluctant, but before long, she becomes a welcome addition to the normally close-minded Dogville.\nWhile most films would end happily, with Grace starting a new chapter in her life, \"Dogville\" continues on and descends into more malevolent territory.  As one too many secrets come to light and more and more citizens begin to harbor hateful feelings toward Grace, it doesn't take long for the once pleasant town to transform into a poisonous brewing of malice. \nIt took me three days to finish \"Dogville\", pacing myself at an hour every night -- not a response of boredom, but a response hoping to savor.  With nine chapters and a prologue, the film is decidedly a magnum opus of ideas, most of them penetrative if you take the time to really think about what you're watching.  By spacing viewing out as far as possible, I was then able to digest the film -- helpful considering its size -- and in return, I found myself riveted.  Not riveted in the same way I was when watching Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton play verbal cat-and-house in \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\": riveted by the performances, von Trier's unfolding of his conceptual idiosyncrasies.\n\"Dogville\"'s plunge into perniciousness does not come swiftly; it climbs slowly, arriving almost inevitably.  \"Evil can arise anywhere,\" von Trier stated about the film upon release.  \"As long as the situation is right.\" With a relationship built on enigma and dead end, the town's disdain for Grace comes as no surprise, but the way they make it known is terrifying, affecting us enormously.  Humans may be inherently cruel and violent, but von Trier's delivery of the sentiment is hardly contrived.  If most were to philander around a hellhole like Dogville long enough, how long would it be before they spoke their minds instead of hiding their feelings for the sake of manners? How long would it be before confrontations became a norm? The shocking conclusion places morality itself in question.  Heaven may be a place on earth if you find the right person, but if your life is sinful, crime-riddled, lonesome, does politeness, unfiltered kindness, matter?\nA film like \"Dogville\" requires performers unafraid of ambitious material, and the cast, large and monumental, transcends limitations.  Kidman is fearless, by turns sympathetic and maddening, and her co-stars, particularly Bacall, Clarkson, and Bettany, startle us in their ability to convincingly walk around wearing two faces and really mean it when they rip off their inviting one.\n\"Dogville\" is an extremely difficult film.  It requires a viewer that regards patience as a virtue.  But with its cerebral ideas and deceptively condensed setting, it offers filmmaking thrilling in its unwillingness to conform.  Von Trier doesn't fear his audience and he doesn't fear his innermost beliefs.  Call him controversial, call him xenophobic; he goes where other directors wouldn't dare.",

            "content": "This is the fourth movie I've seen by the infamous Lars von Trier, and I have to admit it's turning out I like most of his work a lot better than I ever thought I would after Antichrist. This actually, by pure chance, makes an interesting comparison with the previous film/filmmaker I watched, Funny Games by Michael Haneke. On the surface, von Trier and Haneke would seem to have a lot in common: both are deadly serious European art filmmakers who seem to specialize in exploring the darkest aspects of human existence while denying the audience any of the pleasures most people expect from movies. An interesting n+1 article I found labelled Haneke and von Trier as part of the same movement, a movement the author called \"sadomodernism.\" However, while every Haneke film I watch convinces me further that Haneke is essentially a fraud with nothing to say, every von Trier film I watch (except for Antichrist, obviously) convinces me that, for better or worse, he's the real deal. Haneke makes the audience feel pain in order to prove to himself how much better and smarter he is than us; von Trier makes the audience feel pain because he himself feels pain.\n\nThis movie, which runs for a rather long 3 hours, is built around a unique mise-en-scene conceit: while the film's story is set in a town in Colorado in the 1930s, the actual set is just a huge, empty stage with the outlines of buildings drawn in chalk on the floor and labelled. There are a few props - beds, cabinets, a couple of cars, etc. - but the buildings themselves are purely imaginary. Whenever the actors \"enter\" one, they put their hands around invisible doorknobs to open the invisible doors. The whole thing is a bit like an experimental theater piece, but with uses of sound and cinematography unique to film.\n\nThe story revolves around a woman named Grace (Nicole Kidman) who appears in the tiny town of Dogville while running away from gangsters for unexplained reasons. The town has to decide what to do with her presence, and the film spends the next three hours charting the rise and fall of Grace's relationship to the town. There are quite a lot of great actors playing the townsfolk - Paul Bettany, Patricia Clarkson, Stellan Skarsgaard, Jeremy Davies, Philip Baker Hall, Chloe Sevigny, and Lauren Bacall among them. Everyone does a great job committing to the unusual premise, and their performances collectively create a strange but believable little world.\n\nIn spite of the obviously bizarre staging, in some ways the film's story and characters feel a bit more conventional than usual for von Trier. At times, the film seemed like a dark twist on things like the play Our Town or the novel Winesburg, Ohio. Eventually, of course, this being von Trier, things go down into utter sadness and degradation, but what did you expect? One of my main criticisms of von Trier's Nymphomaniac was that the bleak ending felt out of place and trite; here, the similarly bleak ending actually feels earned and inevitable. My main complaint here is that the movie at times feels like it's 3 hours long for the sake of being 3 hours long; there's some material that probably could've been cut without much changing the overall effect of the movie. Still, this is a better, smarter, more restrained piece of filmmaking than I ever would've thought von Trier capable of after my initial exposure to him. If you have the patience for this sort of thing, I do recommend trying it some time.",

Danish auteur Lars von Trier lies in dead heat with German writer-director Michael Haneke when it comes to who can craft Lynchian nightmares the rawest. What has the chops to be the former's most sweeping feature yet -- in which a pretty, stepford-looking blonde on the run from a group of nondescript mobsters washes up on the tight-knit communal plateau of Dogville, Colorado -- actually turns out to be his least cinematic, a story told in nine specific chapters and filmed entirely on a soundstage, the physical roofs of huts and barns only occasionally seen via overhead angles complete with fairy tale narrations by a suitably droll John Hurt. The rest of the three-hour runtime is told unflinchingly through handheld digital camera. The end result is one of the most disorienting at-home movie experiences I've ever witnessed, though also...well, charmed isn't exactly the right term. (Semi-charmed?)\n\nVon Trier, like the aforementioned David Lynch or Haneke (probably others too, I'm just not THAT cultured in film history I guess), essentially coordinates narrative and visual devices to register as particularly meaningful dreams. Each of his opuses thus far -- from \"Breaking the Waves\" and \"Dancer in the Dark\" to \"Antichrist\" and \"Melancholia\" -- share similar moral foundations of good being consumed by evil; innocence by arrogance. Another key theme in his panache is man's perception and subsequent treatment of women. In \"Dogville\" the porcelain Hollywood beauty Nicole Kidman plays Grace, whose instinctually refined personality traits run a diffuse ripple through the bleak, black tensions of the movie's titularly urbane municipal.\n\nHow \"Dogville\" succumbs to the primitive second natures of this barely peopled town should remain unspoiled, but what von Trier finally twists his latest masterpiece into is, fair warning, somewhat of a subjectively cruel joke. Don't take his word for it though. \"Dogville\" is a parable, meaning, like the best of them, the uncertainty of its social commentary should be chewed over and contemplated rather than rejected and spit out as soon as the reel cuts off. \"Dogville\" may be done with by then, but the chilling mystique of its agonies and ironies linger on.

Philosophically we are made to question the actions of everyone in this story and we ask ourselves what we would have done. Aggressive behavior brings on more aggression. People should be accountable for their actions...The film is quite long for what it is...a play.",

Or maybe that was just me.\n\nIt's one of those movies wherein every single aspect of the movie has a point. Like I mentioned, very slow moving but worth it.

Director Lars von Trier is a mastermind at creating anxiety, the camera movements and the editing bring a sense of urgency and queasiness to this picture. Not only is the camera work original, but the staging of the scenes, the use of theatrical elements and miming bring a sense of surrealism to it as well, as if these people are living in a world of illusion as well as we are. I don't think I've ever seen a movie like it and I don't think I ever will. It is challenging, troubling, and difficult, but perhaps one of the most innovative to come out of minimalistic schools and 21st Century Style. A real original, an extremely compelling film.",

Many have claimed that the film is intentionally anti-American, and while it criticises American culture to an extent, it is more critical of the human condition and how we treat one another -- all issues pertinent to the US, but also Europe and the rest of the world.\nWith one of the most impressive acting ensembles, especially in regard to Nicole Kidman, Dogville shows the inhuman side of humanity. The rest of the cast is amazing as the hardened villagers of a small village in the American mountains. The intense close ups and awkward moments are perfectly depicted as if it were truly real life, and not a film. \nAlso, being part of Lars von Trier's dogma ideology it is highly minimalist and experimental. If for anything else, it should be watched for its strange visual technique and mesmerising performances.",
