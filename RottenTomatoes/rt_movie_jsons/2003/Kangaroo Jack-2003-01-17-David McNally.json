This movie really gets down deep in the human brain and unlocks something in it. when I watched this I had this feeling deep inside of me. the kangaroo was made with perfect CGI. every word said had a deeper meaning to it. this movie helped me get through a lot of struggles in my life including depression. this movie even brought my grandmother back to life because of how perfect it is. I would definitely watch this movie especially if you are struggling financially, mentally, or even physically.",

            "content": "Kind of a Mess and has more flaws than good things. The acting overall is just ok. Jerry O'Connel is not good especially when he is doing anything with the CGI Kangaroo because it feels like he is struggling with the fact he's staring at nothing. Anthony Anderson has a good lively and funny delivery and presence and is the best thing about the film but his character who is not fleshed out and bad jokes hold back his performance constantly. The rest of the cast is just ok and generic. The music is ok at best and forgettable. The cinematography is ok with the scenes with the CGI Kangaroo not fitting the rest of the film and looking cheap. There are also some weird camera angles sometimes that feel out of place. The rest is just ok. The Pacing is actually pretty solid because its such a quick film and moves at a fast pace throughout the whole thing but never really builds tension. The editing is the biggest problem here being not very good at all because outside of the stupid montage transition scenes which don't fit the rest of the picture, the scenes with Jack & the others feel almost like two different films at times. The Plot is also very stupid and just feels like at times this is the script of two different movies put together that don't work. Finally the jokes are not good at all and I only found myself laughing at times because of how bad they were and in the middle I was shocked how many were predictable. Overall this is kind of a mess plot & editing wise and not very good overall. I would say skip this completely it not very good.",

            "content": "Hey its me Kangaroo Jack star of the movie! I think this is a critically acclaimed gem, a master piece that god himself crafted with his gentle touch. Once in a lifetime you'll come across a film that truly captures the history and cultural distinctions of the modern world the way a person can subjectively perceive it through our guided field of perspective. I have to admit, I had my doubts when I first learned of the movie. After all, Kangaroo jack? Will this script even be good? How ignorant was I to even have these thoughts. Little did I know I was about to indulge in what may have been the best 1 hour and 39 minutes of my life. The movie started out strong. The opening scenes enticed the audience with a captivating enigma. I was so taken aback from the next-generation animation that I almost didn't even realize the underlying symbolism in the ongoing scenes. It wasn't until my twenty sixth viewing of the movie where I finally got my bearings together and was able to focus on the gripping and labyrinthine stratagem. The underlying analogy for 19th century distopianism and the evangelical deviation of typical orthodoxy was enlightening to say the least. Just when I thought the movie could not get any better, the increasing conflict before the climax began. I could not believe the complexity of the story as the main bee protagonist, Me, struggled with the everyday endeavors for a quintessential Roo such as the consistent up- hill altercation of the fight against a jacket stuck on me and the fiscal synergy of opposing interplanetary dynamism with a pocket full of Twizzlers. There I was, gripping to my chair as the conflict of the movie began. I was so enticed by the movie that I felt as if I was both practically and relatively apart of the movie. This is a special kind of high that not even the strongest of drugs can give you. Was I part of the movie? Am I inside the movie right now? This movie will leave you questioning existential nihilism and the objective skepticism of our perceived valuation of anthropological existence. At this point in the film, I was fully intoxicated by the realistic CGI of my glorious persona. That's when the plot finally aggrandized and I was completely stupefied. You could have lived a thousand years of isolation trying to predict the plot twist and you would never even scratch the surface of what actually transpires in the movie. I was so bewildered that I actually had to pause the movie so that my existential crisis didn't dive too deep inside of myself. Even pausing the movie was surreal. It's almost as if life paused with the movie. I felt as though I had actually become a cinematic tangent quantum. The effects are still wearing off and I haven't been able to watch the movie in several years. I spent the following seven years afraid of what outside of my house actually looks like. Every single day and night I live in misery because I became fully aware that happiness is never achievable. I realized that kangaroo life has absolutely no meaning and that no matter what I ever do, it is of complete unimportance and in years from now, no recollection of my existence will prevail, meaning that if I died years ago, died now, or die sometime in the future it will not matter whatsoever to anyone. But, then again, the fact that I'm living doesn't matter either so I might as well stick around for awhile, living in complete isolation, condemned to a life of traumatic memories and a completely corrupted sub-conscience. Kangaroo Jack literally ruined my life. 10/10",

The movie plot isrelatively complex and i would not rate it as a family movie, as any child below the age of 12 lacks any form of wisdom to even understand the movie. However with my astronomically high intellect i can safely assure you this is a piece of art. The plot is about two men from Brooklyn, which immediately makes the movie unique as i have watched many movies in my lifetime and not one of the was set in Brooklyn. These two men have to fulfill a task of delivering $50,000 to a gang in outback Australia. However, a kangaroo accidentally gets away with the money and they have to acquire the money back. I will not spoil the movie as i am a man of morality. However i am proud to say that i have a copy of these on DVD so i would gladly rent it to you (i am not willing to sell as it is one of my prized possessions and i shall give it to one of my children once i have died) I also do not know how this did NOT get an Oscar for best picture as the winner for that year (Lord of the rings: Return of the king) has absolutely nothing noteworthy about it except that it was filmed in new zealand which is a really nice country that id recommend you visit. Back to the topic at hand, a single scene in Kangaroo Jack is better than the entire Lord of the rings trilogy alone. The scene where Louis and Charlie are singing 'Land down under' whilst driving really brought a tear to my eye. All in all, i believe it is a sin to not see this movie and if you dont watch it then i disapprove of your actions all past, present and future. Good day to you.",

            "content": "Hey kids, do you want to see a wacky family comedy about two guys who get constantly kicked by a rapping CGI kangaroo? Well, too bad because the kangaroo isn't the main character, he only occasionally appears in a pathetic attempt to justify the title, it's mostly two guys chasing him and you know that bit where he raps in the trailer? Sorry but it's a dream sequence that was only meant for the trailer. Instead, you get a mix between an unfunny family comedy and an unfunny crime comedy. Because surely, unintentional sexual harassment is what every 8-year-old wants to see in their movie about a Looney Tunes kangaroo. Yes, this movie is not as family-friendly as the advertising may have led you to believe. While the movie was released at a time when all PG-rated comedies were trying to be edgy in the wake of Shrek's success, the reason why it didn't work here because there's no subtlety. The script casually admits saying crap like \"...make your testicles fall off\" and \"We're having a very intimate, non-gay moment\". While children are going to learn about this stuff eventually, at least don't mention them verbatim. If Disney can write a song about an old man lusting for a much younger woman and wanting to avoid damnation without directly saying \"Sex is evil and I am horny\", then surely you can make some improvements as well, Warner Bros. I'll admit Christopher Walken was the best thing about this movie and I got a laugh in just one scene which for me was basically if the writers of Austin Powers made a kids' movie(?). The humour is terrible, the action is unexciting, the characters are generic, the content is VERY PG-13, the CGI kangaroo is nightmarish and not very convincing even when he's not CGI and this movie also has the most insulting special features I've ever seen. If you go to the bonus features menu on the DVD, everyone behaves as if the kangaroo is a big part of the movie. Must be some slow days for his voice actor. There's even a behind-the-scenes on HOW THEY MADE CAMELS FART!!! It says a lot about the quality of your movie when your crowning achievement in sound design was flatulence. Kangaroo Jack is awful!",

            "content": "\"Australia, the Land Down Under... home to 20 million Kangaroos...\" What a great start to a movie!\n\nThe only problem with the movie Kangaroo Jack is that Kangaroo Jack, a lively marsupial that we were lead to believe was the main character, is not the main character. That's right, in fact, the main characters are Charlie Carbone (Jerry O'Connell) and Louis Booker (Anthony Anderson) from Brooklyn. This movie was not what one might have expected. We were lead to believe it was about Kangaroo Jack, an animated talking marsupial who resides in Australia, however, it spends about half of the movie in Brooklyn fleshing out the character roles of Charlie and Louis. By the way, it doesn't do a great job of that either. \n\nThis movie is a slapstick family comedy that will be a hit for little ones who don't think much about story lines, or lowbrow humor, or having sexual innuendos go over their head.\n\nHere's a quick summary of the movie. It begins with a flashback to introduce the main characters and then flashes forward into the lives of Charlie (Jerry O'Connell) and Louis (Anthony Anderson). Louis has a job he needs help with and some to find out it was delivery stolen TVs. After a police chase scene they end up where Charlie's mob boss step dad was storing stolen goods. This makes Sal (Charlie's step dad) very angry and he send them on a mission to Australia. This was basically just a ton of bland chase scenes and a very strange ending.\n\nFor a family film, this one was pretty violent. It seems that everyone brandishes a gun at some point and it crosses the line a bit with this quote from Mr. Smith where he says, \"I'll chop you into snags and feed you to the crocs.\" Add to that the fact that the only female role is an overly sexy wildlife foundation employee and we end up with not the most family-friendly image.\n\nIn essence, the comedy was nothing above juvenile, the violence was a bit over the top for a family comedy, and, most importantly, Kangaroo Jack only has a handful of parts to play. If you were expecting the lively kangaroo from the trailer to take the show, then this movie will disappoint you. He simply does not play as big of a part in the movie as the trailer led us to believe. \n\nI don't even want to mention the fact that the whole time it felt as if the director's didn't know whether to make the kangaroo as close to natural as possible or to make him the lively talking kangaroo we saw in the trailers. If only the airplane lavatory scene could have saved this film from an onslaught of poor reviews and disappointment. \n\nThis movie is great for audiences with low attention spans and ones who don't care about the plot, or really anything that makes the movie good. As for the rest of us, don't waste your time. You're better off watching Elf which was also released in 2003. It took the comedy aspect of this movie and made it flourish.",

            "content": "''Kangaroo Jack'' concerns a pair of hapless fellows from Brooklyn who set off for Australia with $50,000 of a Mafioso's money, which is promptly snatched by a marsupial, setting in motion all manner of tiresome high jinks. Actually, the hectic, pointless motion of this interracial buddy action kiddie comedy a kind of eager younger brother to the cruder, more violent ''National Security,'' begins well before the kangaroo arrives on the scene. Early on, there is a squealing car chase through someplace supposed to be Brooklyn, during which many pounds of fish and several television sets fall from trucks. Behind the wheel is Louis Booker (Anthony Anderson), a roly-poly black schemer who is always leading his white best friend, Charlie Carbone (Jerry O'Connell), into trouble. Twenty years earlier, according to a flashback, Louis saved Charlie from drowning at Coney Island. Now the two of them have run afoul of Sal Maggio (Christopher Walken), a crime boss who also happens to be Charlie's stepfather. Mr. Walken's presence guarantees the film a future life, as evidence, along with ''The Country Bears'' and ''The Affair of the Necklace,'' that he may be the least discriminating actor in film history.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, for reasons that are neither very important nor very coherently explained, the two pals set off for the Outback, where they meet some funny-talking locals, an American expatriate love interest for Charlie (Estella Warren) and various bad guys, including a few who have followed them from Brooklyn. (Louis, an overweight man with the demeanor of an 8-year-old, has no love interest.) As photographed by Peter Menzies Jr., the Australian desert is as grand and austere in its rust and ocher tones as the American Southwest. What better to do with such a quiet, majestic landscape than to liven it up with the noise and vulgarity of lowest-common-denominator American pop culture? And so, since real kangaroos are not dynamic, or commercial, enough, the actual animals are enhanced by computer imagery, so that one in particular can hop around in a red baseball jacket snatched from Louis. (In a hallucination sequence, and then during the end credits, the beasts even talk, one of them in the voice of the ever-versatile, ever-unembarrassable Mr. Walken.)\r\n\r\nThe details of the theft are worth mentioning, since they give some sense of what this movie thinks its young target audience will find humorous. (''Kangaroo Jack,'' which is rated PG, is being heavily promoted on children's television.) Charlie and Louis run over the kangaroo in their Jeep and, thinking the creature is dead, decide to dress him up in their clothes and take pictures of it (what everyone does with road kill, I guess.) Then he springs to life and bounds away, leaving them to give chase on foot, in a plane and on the backs of camels prone to severe flatulence. The movie, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by David McNally (who did ''Coyote Ugly'' for Mr. Bruckheimer a few years ago), wants to have it both ways: to be mean and bratty while retaining a wholesome veneer. Thus, Ms. Warren's character is a wildlife conservationist whose breasts are fondled by Mr. O'Connell and repeatedly ogled by the cameras. Thus, many guns are brandished and aimed, but nobody is actually shot. The late revelation that the two friends were being set up for a gangland execution is treated as offhandedly as the bizarrely inappropriate reference to ''Scarface.'' Friendship is reaffirmed, and the dim-witted good guys wind up fabulously rich. \r\n\r\nThis movie is disgusting.",
