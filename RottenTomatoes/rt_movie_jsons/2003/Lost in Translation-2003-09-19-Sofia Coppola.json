    "summary": "A lonely, aging movie star named Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and a conflicted newlywed, Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), meet in Tokyo. Bob is there to film a Japanese whiskey commercial; Charlotte is accompanying her celebrity-photographer husband. Strangers in a foreign land, the two find escape, distraction and understanding amidst the bright Tokyo lights after a chance meeting in the quiet lull of the hotel bar. They form a bond that is as unlikely as it is heartfelt and meaningful.",

The only movies of his I enjoyed was where he played an arrogant SOB that got his (Groundhog Day, Scrooged).  So for me, his character isn't all that sympathetic, although I get the thing where the washed up actor has to go to Japan to shoot commercials.  That Scarlet Johansson would like him is a bit far fetched unless it is for anything other than his money and fame, which would destroy the point of the movie.  ANYWAY, all that said, the film is fine for what it is.  It is not a conventional story, but rather a wistful snapshot into a captivating time in the writer's life that disappeared all too quickly.  It isn't a movie, it is a picture, like the snapshot Murray saves of Charlotte in his overcoat.",

            "content": "Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is a fading American movie star who arrives in Tokyo to appear in lucrative advertisements for Suntory whisky. He stays at the upscale Park Hyatt Tokyo and is suffering from strains in his 25-year marriage and a midlife crisis. Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), another American staying at the hotel, is a young Yale University graduate in philosophy who is accompanying her husband John (Giovanni Ribisi) while he works as a celebrity photographer in Japan. Charlotte is feeling similarly disoriented as she questions her recent marriage and is unsure about her future. They both grapple with additional feelings of jet lag and culture shock in Tokyo and often pass the time lounging around the hotel. Charlotte is repelled by a vacuous Hollywood actress named Kelly, who is also at the Park Hyatt, promoting an action film. She bumps into Charlotte and John, gushing over photography sessions she has previously done with him. Bob and Charlotte frequently happen across each other in the hotel and eventually introduce themselves in the hotel bar. After several encounters, when John is on assignment outside Tokyo, Charlotte invites Bob into the city to meet some local friends. They bond through a fun night in Tokyo, where they experience the city nightlife together. In the days that follow, Bob and Charlotte spend more time together, and their friendship strengthens. One night, while neither can sleep, the two share an intimate conversation about Charlotte's personal uncertainties and their married lives...\n\n\"Lost in Translation\" received widespread critical acclaim, particularly for Murray's performance and for Coppola's direction and screenplay. Rotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads, \"Effectively balancing humor and subtle pathos, Sofia Coppola crafts a moving, melancholy story that serves as a showcase for both Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.\" Critics widely praised Murray's performance as Bob, commending his handling of a more serious role that was combined with the comic persona for which he was already broadly known. Writing for Slate, David Edelstein argued that it was \"the Bill Murray performance we've been waiting for\", adding that \"his two halves have never come together as they do here, in a way that connects that hilarious detachment with the deep and abiding sense of isolation that must have spawned it\". Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly regarded Murray's performance as Oscar-worthy and lauded it as his \"most vulnerable and unmannered\" to date; she praised his treatment of a more delicate role as well as his improvisations in the film's comic sequences. The New York Times critic Elvis Mitchell had similar praise, calling Lost in Translation \"Mr. Murray's movie\" and remarking that the actor \"supplies the kind of performance that seems so fully realized and effortless that it can easily be mistaken for not acting at all\". Coppola received a similar level of acclaim for her screenplay and direction. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times commented that Lost in Translation was \"tart and sweet, unmistakably funny and exceptionally well observed\u2014[which] marks ... Coppola as a mature talent with a distinctive sensibility and the means to express it\". Much of the praise was directed specifically at her attention to qualities of subtlety and atmosphere; David Rooney of Variety praised the film as \"a mood piece\", adding that its \"deft balance of humor and poignancy makes it both a pleasurable and melancholy experience\". Likewise, Salon critic Stephanie Zacharek lauded Coppola as a \"stealth dramatist\" whose understated narrative style made for an artful depiction of emotion; she praised Lost in Translation as an intimate story that marks Coppola as an exceptional filmmaker. (Via Wikipedia)\n\nSofia Coppola\u00b4s film about isolation and loneliness, or as she described it herself \"things being disconnected and looking for moments of connection\", in a foreign country has a great Bill Murray and a subtle lovely Scarlett Johansson in the lead. There\u00b4s a midlife crisis for Bob and a beginninglife crisis for Charlotte that takes different expressions and routes. And yet they find eachother in between this and connect. Sofia Coppola has an eye for direction, visuals and style which runs throughout the film. She present Tokyo in an eye-catching way that makes you want to go there, which I have wanted for years. \"Lost In Translation\" has great acting, direction, soundtrack, plot, comedy, drama, style and visuals. Yes, it\u00b4s a slowpaced film that feel stale at times, but not boring. Which shows that Coppola managed to catch that feeling you have when your are simply lost in translation. I can relate as I have myself lived in a country I didn\u00b4t understand the language and at times I simply couldn\u00b4t make myself understood no matter how much I tried in English, which in return creates an isolation and loneliness.\n\nTrivia: At the 76th Academy Awards, Lost in Translation won Coppola Best Original Screenplay, and the film was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Director (Coppola), and Best Actor (Murray). Other accolades won include three Golden Globe Awards and three British Academy Film Awards. The opening shot of Scarlett Johansson is actually influenced by a painting by John Kacere, whose painting shows up later in the hotel. Johansson was reportedly nervous about appearing in her underpants, so to ease her down, Sofia Coppola did the first take herself while wearing the same underpants. The inspiration for having Bob Harris do a Suntory whisky commercial was partially inspired by the fact that Sofia Coppola's father, Francis Ford Coppola, made a real Suntory commercial with Akira Kurosawa in the 1970s.",

            "content": "Will everyone like Lost In Translation, absolutely not!  Modern audiences are being reared to expect action and violence and explosions, big expensive explosions and story and character development is often laid aside to keep audiences glued to the screen.  This is a huge problem in Hollywood and while there have been many films that are action packed that are also compelling in other ways, many simply focus solely on this action to carry the film.  Fast paced, violent, and action packed could describe the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but you have interesting characters and a well written saga that has great depth and scope to give purpose to the proceedings.\n     Lost In Translation on the other hand, delves solely into character development and dialogue as well as silence.  This silence is crucial to the film as a whole because it really makes you dwell on the characters and their feelings, their relationships are vital.  The film is written smartly and gives the actors involved, especially Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson, room to give captivating performances.  This is a drama film that is truly a pleasure to watch, and is filled with a complexity of emotions and relationships that all manage to stay true to the human spirit on display here.  The setting is Tokyo, Japan and it is here the two primary characters explore and evolve in their relationship with one another as friends.  The film description would imply an affair between the two characters with one another, each married with a troubled marriage.  Yet, this never happens on screen or even is implied off screen.  Instead, we are simply observers of two very different characters in different parts of life, enjoying a trip with each other instead of being alone.\n      Sofia Coppola follows up her directing debut, The Virgin Suicides, with what could very well be her masterpiece with this amazing film!  She proves she isn't just the daughter of the legendary Francis Ford Coppola and really proves herself here as both the writer and director of the film.  If you can get past the lack of big budget blockbuster films and take the time to sit down and let the film simply wash over you, you will be greatly rewarded for doing so!",

The story is about a washed-up actor shooting in Japanese and him meeting a young woman, who is accompanying her significant other on a business trip. \n\nThere are several aspects that can be discussed. There is loneliness, the problems of fitting in, the difference in cultures and the titular numerous small things in japanese that are lost in translation, and finally the problems in relationships. This is a slow-paced movie, almost meditative. The two characters face all this abovementioned problems and finally connect with each other. \n\nPerhaps this is my main issue with this movie. Instead of focusing on other aspects, delving deeper into them, they serve as a start to the new budding relationship between the two characters. While this is fine from a story-building perspective it left me unsatisfied coming into this movie with different expectations. From my point of view those other aspects were left unexplored. Though as a little bit of warning, I have no prior experience with this director or even actors, so there is a possibility I might have missed something.\n\nThis a fine movie.

I had not realized it had been almost 20 years since this release and I definitely appreciate aspects of this film much more than I did on my original watch, when I was about 17 years younger.\n\nCoppola's subtle exploration of loneliness and disconnection employs such a heartwarming tone, further made possible with a beautiful performance from Bill Murray, a role I can imagine no one better suited for. A very young Scarlett Johansson was well cast too and at times this whole film really hinges on the innocently loving chemistry her and Murray were able to create.\n\nCoppola utilizes the city of Tokyo brilliantly here as well, almost to the extent that it feels like it should receive third billing. The sound design deserves mention too, as it really creates the right atmosphere both in the big city shots, and the smaller, more intimately shot, scenes.\n\nI can't wait to see what I get out of this film another 17 years from now.",

            "content": "This is a slow, heartfelt film that doesn't let its comedy get in the way of the story it's trying to tell. This works surprisingly well for Bill Murray, who I've always known as more of a laugh-out-loud comedy style and less of a dry, down-to-Earth style. There's a plot here, but the movie is really more of an exploration of feelings and lives than a here-to-there adventure. The ending is vague, but the impression I got is that the characters are leaving us in a different way than they started, even if their real-life situations aren't changing.\n\nNow I feel like I need to address the elephant in the room... When this movie was made, Scarlett Johansson was 18 and Bill Murray was 52!!! It's undeniable that they have a lot of onscreen chemistry, but their more romantic moments feel uncomfortable, especially given that Murray's character is often the one in \"power\" (whether that's financially or socially). The worst part is that I didn't even feel a need for a romance here at all - what's wrong with telling the story of two people who become close friends? It would have been just as powerful as, if not more than, than the story we were told.\n\nUnfortunately, that hampered a lot of this film for me, but I was thoroughly impressed with the nuanced writing, set pieces, and score throughout. I also appreciated how the film was able to joke about Japanese culture while being (mostly) respectful to it. It's a good film and I'm sure most people will enjoy it.",

Charlotte is a recently married college graduate, visiting Tokyo with her husband, and already questioning the wisdom of getting married.  When they meet in their hotel, a unique bond is formed based on loneliness, isolation, and the desperate need to find some sort of meaning in their seemingly vacant lives.  Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation drips with pathos but never becomes overly sentimental, thanks to Coppola's bare-bones script and subtle direction, allowing meaningful images to convey emotions rather than excessive dialogue.  Beautifully shot and acted, Lost in Translation has more than its fair share of quiet humor, but is ultimately an intensely heart-breaking story of two people who are lost in life.",

Bill Murray gives his best performance I\u2019ve seen from him and Scarlett Johansson is almost as good as she was in Marriage Story, but that had some of the best acting I\u2019ve seen period. I like more subtle things like since they two main characters feel lost and empty with their lives, the color is dim. But once we reach the end the color is more vivid, but it\u2019s still not bright. But the ending is one of the best I\u2019ve seen. It requires a lot of thought and might not satisfy everyone.

The two main characters don't even talk that much, they spend most of their time just looking at each other.

A part arrives where Bob begins to sing and we can see him in the foreground and Charlotte in the second, however, you can see how Charlotte looks at him, we can see the actions and expressions of both.

In one storyline, it could be, and more.\n\n But that's why it intrigues me and keeps me coming back to watch at different points in my life. It's essentially 2 people who are lost, emotionally, spiritually and physically. They find themselves in a country where they're unfamiliar and then find comfort in their lost lives, with each other. Something everyone finds themselves to some degree in their life at some point. \n\nI think this could be the underlying genius in this film, it's simply about how we as humans are complex, we're always trying to find a purpose, direction or motivation in life. And this is shown marvelously by the older Bill Murray's long term married, slightly comical and slightly sad character Bob Harris. Then On the juxtapositioned, we have a young and newlywed Charlotte played by an extremely young (17) Scarlett Johansson, who is intelligent, witty and recently graduated university, newly married to a man with a well-paid job. And realizes she has no direction whatsoever.\n\n Of course, the intelligently written and directed story by Sofia Coppola is intriguing, thought-provoking and deeply interesting. I'd love to ask her if this was based on personal experience or part of her creative mind? Some quotes seem to point to a bit of both, and in my experience, Tokyo can definitely be easy to get lost in.\n\nThe deeply real and human way the story unfolds is fantastically written, it makes me immersed in their world as if it's a real-life story.",

Occasionally Bill Murray would open his mouth and say something funny, or he\u2019d mug for the camera, which helped put some life into the film. But most of the way through the boredom got the best of me. I can say that I was charmed by the personalities of the actors, and I appreciated the less traditional relationship, because typically this would just be a star-crossed lovers\u2019 story (where they fall in love when away from their spouses and get into a torrid affair.) Not that an affair never happens, because that comes up as well. At that point, the film completely lost me, because it removed the small amount of likability from Bill Murray\u2019s character and fell into the exact clich\u00e9 that I thought they were cleverly avoiding. Other than that, there was nothing annoying or unpleasant about Lost in Translation. It was simply a bland experience. It is the kind of movie that, years from now, I might forget if I even saw it because nothing stuck with me. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some deeper meaning that others are drawing from this, or some more powerful emotional truth that people see. I hope there\u2019s something I\u2019ve missed, because there must be a reason that a movie which feels so slight has been lauded by so many.",

            "content": "The beginning of a romantic relationship in film is usually marked by a kiss or sexual intercourse but this is a film about an emotional rather than physical connection that knows people do not necessarily connect immediately. Director Sofia Coppola has always been a master at capturing a certain mood and tone through music, long shots of her central characters seemingly alone in a foreign environment and subtly humorous touches in her highly quotidian screenplays. She made the ideal second film here as she brought everything that was fantastic about The Virgin Suicides (1999) to this effort while going against the critics who had claimed her films lacked emotional depth with a story all about fragile humans looking for a connection with another.\n\nAging American actor Bob Harris, Bill Murray, travels to Tokyo, Japan so that he can film commercials for Suntory whiskey. He is clearly unenthused about this project and his relationship with his wife is emotionally fraught despite the fact that he loves her as he is only able to communicate with her and his children through phone conversations. He finds a similarly conflicted soul in the young aspiring photographer Charlotte, Scarlett Johansson, who feels abandoned by her rock musician husband John, Giovanni Ribisi. The two enjoy conversing with one another as Harris is able to inform Charlotte of the complications of marriage and growing old while they experience some emotional connection by going out to bars in Tokyo and exploring the city. Both are aware that they will have to separate and will likely never see one another again but they experience great emotional intimacy during this time and part having learnt something about the nature of relationships.\n\nWe are introduced to our characters with an almost startling intimacy as we feel immediately their deep fear of being alone and confusion about their futures. This is done through simple exchanges they have with those around them and carefully framed shots in which we see how insignificant they appear against a bright, overwhelming backdrop. When Charlotte is abandoned by her husband we sense that she has lost him already, possibly because she is too intelligent for him and has moved beyond him or because his attentions are solely focused on his career while she has no direction outside of him. Yet we are still horrified, as she is, when he is careless enough to leave her alone with a flippant \"I love you\" we know that she needs him to hold her tight and inform her of his feelings with passion and sincerity. Would she believe these declarations? Probably not as the relationship has crumbled to the point where it may be irretrievable and seeing how far they have drifted apart is saddening as they are still young and you want to believe that there is still a chance of them remaining together but without serious effort it is unlikely.\n\nHarris is characterized with equal care as Murray, playing on his own persona, uses humor to deflect from his pains and seems uncomfortable with his fame while being aware that is the only thing that keeps him away from his family who he struggles even more with. There is real humor to the shooting of the commercial but it is not full of obvious put-on gags and hides a deeper meaning in scenes of a flamboyant director asking a lot of Murray in a foreign language. We would like to believe that Harris will find sudden inspiration and return to acting in quality productions but the truth is that he no longer feels excitement about his work and more than most films this movie actually makes you feel sorry for movie stars. There is a certain degree of distance between himself and others not only because he is famous and a foreigner but because he intentionally aloof, presumably a persona adopted after years in an industry that asks him to present a false version of himself. Fortunately he doesn't become completely soft and gooey in the presence of an attractive young woman as he retains his razor sharp wit and introverted personality while understanding that what attracts her to him is his wisdom and intelligence. Few actors could have played this role as well as Murray as he conveys an emptiness and deep sadness beautifully with his blank stare while keeping the wryness that convinces us a younger woman would be drawn to him.\n\nThe two only kiss once and even this kiss is never eroticized or treated as the highpoint of their relationship. Their final goodbye is poignant as although we never know what Harris whispers in Charlotte's ear it doesn't really matter because the point of the interaction is that Harris and Charlotte have learned about love from one another and will remember their brief encounter fondly for the rest of their lives.",

Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson were able to convey this state of being in crisis just perfectly. The episodes of their interaction with the Japanese are very entertaining and fun.

Sofia Coppola is just one-of-a-kind director who has a great sense of sophistication when it comes to showing the feeling and emotions based on numerous beautiful metaphors.

Therefore, either of them would make perfect bittersweet double feature with Lost in Translation. And I loved these two movies so much; however, I have some issues with each one of them. \n\nDon't get me wrong; Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind's script is more genuine and creative, but the main issue I have with it is that it lost its balance between humor and subtle pathos at some point. Lost in Translation, by contrast, doesn't have this problem. In fact, the perfect balance between humor and melancholy. The movie deals with heavy themes such as loneliness, insomnia, emptiness, existential crisis, and more hefty themes, but nonetheless the movie never feels gloomy or bleak. Actually there are some funny moments due to the movie's smart dialogue that made me laugh many times.\n\nAs for Her, I think it is a very unique, and has an idiosyncratic style and screenplay, except for its third act. It chose a familiar and conventional way to end its one-of-a-kind story. That didn't just disappointed me, but that also made the movie feels inconsistent near the end. For a moment, I felt that Sofia Coppola would make the same mistake in Lost in Translation. That's because at some point at the third there was a scene that feels if it sets a subplot that would end the movie in a stereotypical way. And I think this was an unnecessary and manipulative. Also, this is the only main issue I have with Lost in Translation. This movie is bittersweet, but its ending is Just Like Honey!\n\nBoth Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson at the top of their games. They may gave their best performances in their respective career. Scarlett Johansson did a great job in playing the Philosophy graduate Charlotte who is twenty-something. I felt she's really at this age. As for Bill Murray, his role is far more complicated, and he just killed it! I've never seen him giving such a powerful serious performance. His character suffers from something like a midlife crisis, and there are many great actors played characters like this before. But Murray's terrific comedic abilities adds to this character, and made it more complex, yet more amiable. \n\nAside from the fact that this movie looks gorgeous, it's exquisitely directed by the talented director, Sofia Coppola. Just try to notice the visual tools, how they work, and utilized, and what they imply. You will find out that Lost in Translation is a well-directed as it's a well-written film, maybe the direction is what deserves the highest praise. Also, the movie is consistent in tone. As I mentioned, the balance between between humor and sadness, and while the smart screenplay has a major in that, the meticulous direction has a role that isn't, by any means, less important. The soundtrack is sweetly hypnotic! This is now one of my favorite soundtracks put in film. The words of every song match the current state in every different phase in the movie. \n\nI loved Lost in Translation so much! I can't praise it highly enough, or maybe I can, it's Manhattan of the 21st century!\n\n(9/10)",

Both main characters are portrayed as too helpless in their situation although they are, based on all background information, really not. All in all the feeling of being lost in a foreign country is well portrayed but the film is overall uneventful and repetitive. This is not a bad sign per se but combined with the lack of substantial dialogue and unengaging lead characters it makes the movie straight out boring. To my mind, this only changes for about the last 15 minutes, where good conversations take place and a logical emotional connection is set up. Yet the ending is not strong enough to give the movie a rating of more than three stars.",

            "content": "When a famous actor hops over to Tokyo to shoot a commercial, he meets a young woman that fills an empty void in his life.\n\nActing: 10\n\nBeginning: 10\nMy son hates dramas and rightfully so as he's a thirteen-year-old boy. He wants to see things blowing up and people getting thrown through walls. Yet somehow, the first ten minutes of Lost In Translation sucked him in as much as it did me prompting him to watch the whole thing. From the time he touches down in Tokyo, Bob Harris (Bill Murray) sucks you in and holds on to your attention for dear life. You're anxious to see what this man is going to do next.\n\nCharacters: 10\nStaying on Bob for a moment, his character made the film. His dry sense of humor and pure disinterest in everything going on around him is so sincere and captured just perfectly. He's torn between his sense of duty with work and family, so much so that he's almost forgotten how to enjoy life. When Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) comes along, everything changes for him. Charlotte is innocent and sweet and is somehow drawn to Bob like a moth to a flame. Like most \"opposites attract\" relationships, the two fit extremely well together and add a sense of appeal to the film. Watching them both interact with the Japanese people and try to bridge cultural and language gaps was easy comedy that works everytime.\n\nCinematography/Visuals: 10\n\nConflict: 7\n\nGenre: 10\n\nMemorability: 9\nThere are a number of memorable scenes that stick out in my head with a couple of favorites I keep replaying. The first is where he's trying to shoot his commercial. The director is trying to relay something to Bob in Japanese which a translator is telling Bob in English. The scene is only five minutes long and had me cracking up from start to finish. In my other favorite scene, Bob has a run-in in his hotel room with a Japanese prostitute. Again, the language disparity makes the entire interaction one hilarious situation.\n\nOutside of memorable scenes, Lost In Translation gives you a pause for introspection and contemplative thought. Oftentimes we wander aimlessly through the relationships in our lives...but what do they really mean? What are relationships without happiness or closeness? What is the real meaning of a connection?\n\nPace: 9\n\nPlot: 10\nHad this film's story taken place in North America somewhere, it wouldn't have been nearly as impactful. With the setting in Japan, it throws a monkey-wrench into a plot that could have been extremely simple and makes it way more intriguing. Are Bob and Charlotte truly falling for each other or are they just connecting because they are lonely and so far from home? Definite food for thought.\n\nResolution: 8\nAh, the famous ending of Lost In Translation. What did she say? What does it all mean? How does the story end anyway? The ending, while it does leave you hanging, is an intriguing one for sure. I understand the ambiguity and I don't love it, but I'm ok with it.\n\nOverall: 92\nBill Murray is like the Marvel Cinematic Universe...on steroids. They have been putting out hits for a decade now. Murray has been starring in classics for decades. This film is another notch on his belt. Loved it!",

Every scene is beautifully shot with zoomed out establishing shots like the masters. Coppola loves tender close up shots that endear you to her characters and show so much emotion without anything spoken. Her panning shots stick to the actors and let us follow them around while they try to enjoy themselves in Japan.\n\nLost in Translation is a quiet blissful trip to Japan that takes the audience all around Tokyo. We get to see Japanese hotels, bars, restaurants, temples, clubs, karaoke joints, hospitals, strip clubs, and plenty more local spots. It's a cute look into another culture. Sofia Coppola captures another culture with a cool style all her own. \n\nBill Murray is at his best in Lost in Translation. He's a middle aged married man that appears miserable in Japan. Murray acts out his finest performance as the confused tourist and actor struggling to find enjoyment away from home. He's very funny and will keep you entertained by his quips. \n\nAdditionally, Murray expands his acting range into the dramatic during Lost in Translation as he must also depict a forlorn man out of his element. Murray plays the sad mope well so much so you'll think he is not actually having a good time. I think Lost in Translation prevails as one of the greatest films Bill Murray has ever been apart of to date.\n\nThe star of Lost in Translation is Scarlett Johansson as she plays the young wife to Giovanni Ribisi's character John. Ribisi is perfect as the negligent new husband that does not find interest in sweet wife. Ribisi plays the aloof photographer John that completely ignores Johansson's charming character Charlotte. Johansson depicts dejection quite well as she is clearly bored and uncertain about her feelings for her husband. Scarlett Johansson demonstrates she can act convincingly as Lost in Translation is arguably her finest role.\n\nOverall, Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation is worth a watch. You'll laugh and relate to these characters that Coppola wrote so well. They feel so natural in their actions and feelings that you are sure to empathize with their emotions. Give it a chance!",

            "content": "Sofia Coppola works subtly and produces an efficient and succinct romantic comedy-drama.  A Reductionist perspective would describe this as a film about friendship.   Despite this being labelled a romance, I have my doubts as to Coppola's dedication to pure Romanticism.  The primary Romantic notion in this film is the Woody Allen-like age difference between Bob and Charlotte.  The cinematography gives an impression of Romanticism by using lots of close shots that imply intimacy to these characters.  Even though we get to see the characters sitting and laying around in their underwear and bathrobes, doesn't mean it's Romantic intimacy.  Sitting around in one's underwear could literally mean if you're not dressed, you're not going anywhere.  Especially if one has been sitting around in one's underwear long enough they're getting too tight and becoming see-through.  Whether the intimacy is ours, or whether the close shots are their intimacy, or instead a representation of their limited ability to interact in the greater community, is what makes the technique's usage interesting.  \nTwo Americans in a foreign country staying in a Western-themed hotel, it seems unsurprising Bob and Charlotte would be drawn to one another by a sense of familiarity, especially as English speakers.  Bob is having personal family issues and some kind of mid-life crisis (esp. after pausing when Charlotte asks him if he's bought a Porsche.  Did he and didn't admit it?).  He's in Japan promoting whiskey, where it's difficult for him to communicate with the Japanese crew.  He's especially distanced from his children, not only physically but emotionally, even forgetting his son's birthday, and later showing no sign that he's attempting to make up for it.  His wife prompts their conversations.  Instead of enjoying a conversation with his family, he appears as much an outsider to them as he does being a Westerner in Japan as they discuss house renovations.  Having several days of down-time waiting for a TV appearance, and distanced from his family, he has days to ponder and find distractions, though he has no friends, acquaintances, or colleagues in Japan.  Charlotte is a philosophy graduate who is stuck in liminal space, and made the mistake of not entering (though we don't know if she applied to) a Graduate program.  She's briefly moved to Japan with her husband, a busy photographer, and she's unemployed and clearly bored out of her mind.  Unemployment keeps her from the hectic call of preoccupation, and keeps her distant from her husband and his friends, including moments of social conversation where her husband's friends' topics are fast-changing and don't interest her.  Her connection with her family is literally and emotionally distant as well.  In her one family conversation, Charlotte weeps as she talks to her mother, who seems to ignore her small moment of doubt, though we are unsure of their past or present relationship.  \nWhile Bob and Charlotte are both in a liminal space and disconnected, they are operating at the same pace, the thing they have in common is a bout of insomnia probably due to inactivity, and seemingly having nothing in common with anyone else.  As it turns out, Charlotte does know people in Japan, and contacts them (why she didn't beforehand, we don't know), inviting Bob along for the evening.  Charlotte's friends are Japanese (how she knows them, we don't learn), and they visit local nightclubs.  Bob and Charlotte develop a stronger relationship, and due to a minor altercation, one bar tender chases them off firing some kind of kids' gun at them (whatever that thing is), they are momentarily separated from the group until they get back together and meet up for karaoke, where they're better able to integrate into some part of the culture.  \nTheir relationship progresses to the point where they are comfortable enough around each other to sit and drink sake until they can discuss their personal issues and finally sleep.  While there are romantic undertones, their relationship is more platonic and familial.  Charlotte develops a relationship with Bob like she's missing a parental or familiar figure, considering her mother is unable or unwilling to console her from a distance and her husband is busy.  Bob, being dissociated from his children and wife, his wife being in control of the household decisions, relates to Charlotte as an amalgamation of his wife and kids.  He has some attraction to Charlotte, but finds physical intimacy with the lounge singer instead, and Charlotte is not maintaining domesticity like his wife, but is a friend.  Bob also is learning consolation and guidance using experienced insight, practicing a mentoring relationship with another person in a way he apparently does not or cannot with his own children.  Their bond appears to be what both need in that moment.    \nLOST IN TRANSLATION plays like a literary vignette, where both characters wander off in the end with unresolved issues.",

            "content": "Lost in Translation is directed and written by Sofia Coppola, and it stats Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson in a dramedy about a movie star that went to Tokyo to do a commercial for a type of whisky, but knows nothing of the Japanese language and is having a bit of a midlife crisis, while he come across a wife that came to Tokyo because of her husband who's a photographer, and she's not sure of the marriage life that's she's having, while also having nothing else to do that's going on in her life. I remember that I've seen this on Netflix, and actually enjoyed it, but I didn't really know why, although I remembered the whispering scene, which is pretty much the most famous scene of the film. So after seeing this, Lost in Translation is an excellent film that really brought the best out of Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson. Bill Murray is fantastic in it that shows his usual deadpan, which I know the writing is made for that as Sofia Coppola actually wrote this movie for him to be in, while giving off some of the drama elements that works for his character as he's just lost, and is just doing what he can for money, even if he doesn't like doing some of the stuff that gives him money. Scarlett Johansson is also great in this, which I believe that this is the movie that made her well-known as she wasn't in films before this that a lot of people went to go see, and this movie shows the showcase of her talents as an actress by making it a subtle performance, especially for the chemistry between the main characters as you're not quite sure if they are going to be together in the end or not. The movie does a good job of showing some of the lifestyles that Japan citizens do in their everyday lives, and it doesn't portray them in a negative way. It's got some gorgeous shots of Japan, and the conversations between the main characters felt really genuine that you're in there, listening in to their conversations. It also does a great job of showing the challenges that an American person has to go through when they know nothing about the foreign language, and I actually know a lot about the characters here than I did with Sofia's previous film The Virgin Suicides, so it's nice to see improvements. When there are moments that you wonder if they are going in that direction, and it actually mostly doesn't give you a clear answer, which more or less gives in to your interpretation in it, which I thought was really clever as it's from the perspective of Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray's characters and you know as much as they do. Lost in Translation is probably one of my favorites that created human people out of these characters, and I love that in a film with a great script, direction, and acting that comes in as tight as it can be in a good way.",

            "content": "Lost in Translation is a lovely, moody, melancholy film, with a wonderful downbeat score to enhance the atmosphere. It also features possibly the best and most reserved Bill Murray performance ever. Murray's subtlety fits the equal subtlety of the film's moments of humour and emotion. This film is more about the raw feelings and the pathos that it manages to evoke through its wonderful visuals, score, and performances than it is about a complex plot.\n\nThis tale is about culture shock, with Murray playing an unhappily married, ageing Hollywood star called Bob Harris, in Tokyo to film a lucrative whisky commercial. He wants an escape from the intensity and alien nature of his newfound environment - the culture shock and Murray's deadpan acting are where the humour comes from - and a temporary escape from his passionless marriage. He finds this through an unlikely source, Charlotte, a young newlywed seemingly regretting her marriage. The two strike up a friendship, one which blossoms in a nuanced manner, with little dialogue, but an unspoken connection.\n\nDo they love each other, or are they just using one another as an excuse to momentarily escape the reality of their lives? This is what makes their dynamic so interesting, as we can never truly pin down the nature of their relationship. The famous ending, in which Bob whispers inaudible words to Charlotte, emphasises the mysterious and ambiguous nature of their bond. The title 'Lost in Translation' refers to both the differing cultural landscape and the lack of clarity in their relationship.\n\nEqually emotive and funny, and with revelatory performances from two of Hollywood's most loved stars, this is a film that proves that Sofia Coppola is not just a relative of her father, Francis, but a director with her own staggering artistic vision, capable of creating her own brand of beautiful cinema. What we have here is something truly unique and touching.",

            "content": "Sofia Coppola's melodrama combines masterful directing with a powerful performance by Bill Murray, artfully composing a story of loneliness and connection amid the urban isolation of early 2000s Tokyo. Using a delicate touch, Ms. Coppola beautifully balances a physically overflowing metropolis with the deep-seated emptiness felt by her characters, all while keeping audiences engaged in the relatively simple, but wonderfully rich, plot. Lost in Translation is emotional without being clich\u00e9, giving viewers a subtle love story that is both relatable and iridescent. \n\nBob (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) are two lost souls repeatedly finding themselves, and each other, in the bar of an upscale all-inclusive hotel in the wee hours of the night. Facing similar feelings of displacement, Bob, a jaded, washed-up actor shooting Japanese whiskey commercials, struggles with a mid-life crisis, and Charlotte, a young college grad faced with unappealing career choices, tries to find her place in the world. Although both of the jet-lagged companions face failing marriages, with Bob's wife acerbically raising a family alone and Charlotte's husband shallowly ignoring her quiet pleas for engagement, the two remain respectfully distant from one another. While this use of honest restraint, rather than dramatic advances, may not leave viewers with sappy tears, Lost in Translation offers an emotionally richer experience than the typical Hollywood heartbreak. \n\nThe soft chemistry enjoyed by Murray and Johansson shines in the film's wealth of subtle moments, which aggregate to build an undemanding intensity that is both relatable to audiences and personal to the characters. By maintaining remarkable thematic consistency, Ms. Coppola satisfies even the most critical viewers through artistically balanced shots, the ethereal quality her setting provides, and the dream-like atmosphere she gives to Bob and Charlotte's unfolding relationship. From hearty laughs such as Bob's game of Twister with an overenthusiastic hooker to quiet heartaches like the inaudible whisper in the midst of a packed Shibuya sidewalk, Lost in Translation is as good a romance movie as any.",

Somethings we see eye to eye, and understand one another through some mental translation. Somethings we don't see eye to eye because we haven't seen or don't know. Somethings we don't have to understand, but make sense, we just get it and enjoy it. That path to communication we seek, we are able to find, able to be seen, recognized and understand and we don't find and remain invisible. No one notices or pays attention when life is so busy.  When paying attention is so hard when we are distracted with the lights and sounds of the world, entertained, focused on other things, our images, our scores, our job, \nWhen we understand ourselves so well, we don't either like or like. \nWhen we are important or made to look that way, then we naturally draw people's attention. When someone pays attention to ourselves when they are in that same point in their life as you, \"having no clear direction\". but some directions we go, we just end up seeing each other. Naturally we just invite, introduce, and discuss who we are in order to meet people and connect with one another. When you don't know where life wpi.d take you when your open to venturing new worlds, you just go with the flow, escape reality into fantasy, and in between find your true calling that's waiting at the end of your trip. Some world's we share where we have been, in this gateway into indulgences of partying, rocking out and drugs. Something yearning deep within us we wish we could just let out. \nWhen venturing into other world's we forget that our world needs us, we neglect it. Sometimes we are able to bring our world into another world and make it more easier to live, comfortable to pass the time, Somethings we like to keep it the same way and other times we like it different. When we cohabit, and learn to adapt to their ways and bring our own ways in the mix, we become hard to understand and unfamiliar. Sometimes cohabiting can mean it's all about ourselves or about others and rarely both. Sometimes it's better to remain seen with others and other times invisible with the other cohabitants  we wish not to live this world with. Being aliens in a worldly planet or being humans in an alien planet. What bridges both worlds together is what focus & lense we use to learn about each other, notice each other and have some common ground to live by. \nBeing alone in this foreign world, we learn whom we are, this soul we enrich, of likes and dislikes, knowledge, identity, position, and life. \nBeing recognized from another world, but distant in your own world makes the return trip seem unwanted. There are plenty of likes and dislikes we consider about both worlds, we just can't live without, but can't have both, that revert to whom we are and hiding it deep within ourselves, waiting for the next trip to enrich it within ourselves. We have obligations, we have to live by and cannot give up. We must put others ahead of ourselves own happiness. There is no time to dig deep about the questions, the actions, or feelings we have of what escape we did, it's scarier to know the truth, when its obligations we have to follow. \nWhen the cohabit we live with enrich our lives so much, that this person we kept hidden, flourishes. The one souvenir we both wish we could take back. But we are just a flight away to say goodbye forever. Long lasting soul mates.",

            "content": "After reading several articles/reviews on the film, scholars seem to agree on one key factor of the film: the aesthetics create a feeling of dislocation and anxiety for the viewer.  Well, at least at the start of the film.  We need to watch Lost in Translation in its entirety to move from this state of anxiety to a sort of peace of mind; this film definitely toys with emotion in a brilliant manner.\n\nThere are many romance stories that happen in countries outside of the US - there is especially the cliche of setting romantic stories in Paris, France. Setting one in Tokyo, however, puts American audiences in a place that seems a very long way from home since the atmosphere is so different than American culture.  It also doesn't help when the only other Americans in the movie hang out at the hotel lounge where Charlotte (Johansson) sees Bob (Murray) for the first time in the film.  These characters explore the city which gives them a sense of escape when they feel trapped in this foreign land.\n\nIt is clear in the first 15 minutes of the film that each of these leads feel imprisoned or disconnected in this strange land - Charlotte makes a phone call in which she tries to reveal this disconnection while in tears, but the woman on the other end doesn't hear this in her voice.  Bob is visiting Tokyo to make money for a whiskey commercial while he would rather be doing something with more dignity, like a play back in the states. Both characters are married, but when they begin communicating and spending time with each other, each character seems to be a little more complete than before.\n\nIf looking at this movie from a narrative perspective, this seems to have a lot of the traditional second act while it rushes through act one and act three feels more ambiguous than complete for some. It still follows the traditional three act structure, but other scholars do not see it that way. There is definitely more exploration with the aesthetics of the film than there is a cohesive story, but the story is still there. To get outside of narrative you have to watch something that is practically ONLY immersed in mood/visuals such as The Tree of Life.\n\nThe acting is top notch in this film, and the casting of Bill Murray is a great choice. While this may seem more of a melodrama than a romantic comedy, the comedy is still there, and Murray's screen persona fits the character of Bob Harris perfectly.  Johansson is also great in one of her early roles, almost hopeless when her character feels she is no longer connecting with her husband.\n\nDefinitely not your typical rom/com, but it would be a shame to miss.\n\n3.5/4.0",

            "content": "Why is this film so praised? Our protagonists are a naive stuck-up girl right out of college and an equally stuck-up cynical actor. Neither show any real interest in Japanese culture (he's even quite disrespectful) and neither makes any really attempt to connect with the Japanese (even though they both get the chance to connect). Even though she seems to have a degree in philosophy and he seems to be somewhat of an intellectual type, their interactions remain mostly superficial. And still, their interaction with one another is pretty much everything we get to see for this entire film. I guess this film appeals to people just as pretentious and shallow as the main protagonist (which is the only reason I can think of to explain its popularity), but I personally found it hard to connect with either of them AT ALL.\n\nFurther, I wonder how much sense it makes for their relationship to have remained purely platonic. Both seem to be estranged from their respective spouses, his wife is on the other side of the ocean, her husband is on a photo shoot for several days, both act like they haven't had sex in a long time, she's a beautiful impressionable young girl, he's a famous actor, they both don't shun alcohol and at one point they become close enough to lie together on a bed while he touches her feet. Maybe it's just me, but I personally find it hard to believe they didn't end up having sex together considering the aforementioned conditions. Anyway, the shame and confusion arising from such a situation (after both realise they made a mistake cheating their respective spouse) would at least have made a far more interesting film to watch Maybe this film appeals to people who never spent more than a few days in a foreign country, but having spent about 3 months in Poland I couldn't see anything I haven't experienced myself AT A FAR GREATER INTENSITY. For me, this makes \"Lost In Translation\" as exciting to watch as two people sitting at a bus stop waiting for the bus to arrive. Actually the latter would probably be more interesting, because the bus doesn't take THAT long to arrive.",

            "content": "Sofia Coppola's film comes close to being without flaw. It is very much an almost experimental mood piece, but it often feels a bit like a \"road movie\" without access to a street or highway. \n\nLost in Translation presents Bill Murray with a role that seems to have tailor-suited for his snarky, sarcastic and often charming presence. He is brilliant here. An aging movie star stuck in a lavish Japanese hotel. It is clear he doesn't really want to be there or be in the high-paying commercial. One suspects he has come to this fiscally smart but uncreative job more as a means of escape from an unhappy life waiting for him in the states. \n\nScarlett Johansson's young and somehow vacant face lend themselves perfectly for the film and her role as well. Charlotte is lonely, sad and lost. Basically she is just stuck in the hotel while her ambitious hipster husband is fame trolling throughout the city. He seems to have cut her off from his creative life. \n\nWhen she meets Bill Murray's Bob, a fellow kinship is born out of a mutually-shared feeling of loneliness within context of an unknown culture and language. But clearly their bond is far more meaningful than that. \n\nCoppola's film sort of drifts along with out two leading characters as they continue to grow close. When they are apart, the loneliness and seemingly bleak future of their family lives become more sharp. \n\nIn one of the smartest moves ever made by a filmmaker, Coppola avoids the trap of trying to form an actual \"romance.\" Instead she settles for a un-labeled relationship and bond. Another smart move that actually has fueled this magical little movie for over a decade --- at one point Bob comes close to Charlotte and whispers something into her ear. It is something private. We never know what he has told her. It is their secret. \n\nSimple and complex all at once, if Sofia Coppola never succeeds again -- this and her feature film debut, \"The Virgin Suicides\" are all she ever need do to hold her place as a filmmaker of note with a far more keen sense of film editing than her father has ever gained. \n\nTo me, Lost in Translation is a perfect film.",

The odd emotion of both searching characters, is its not really the country thats got them lost, its their life. \n\nSofia Coppola perfectly displays a love story, that deep down, is really heart wrenching, full of melancholy and blind wandering. Instead of a picture of raw display, Coppola gifts moving and warming dialogue, with a elegant and touching purpose; love is not all the same. The back and forth between the characters puts on a layer of humour, but the undertone slips through the cracks of impressive body language.

Sofia Coppola's brilliant 2003 film \"Lost in Translation\" shows a wonderfully beautiful romantic story unlike any other. It's not over-the-top, it's not about star-crossed lovers from rival families, it's not a tragedy, it's not an epic, it's not surrounded by characters who contribute to the troubles of the lovers; instead, it's genuine.\n\nPerhaps looking at the film's cast will give you strange ideas if you have not yet seen the film. An odd pair: Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray. Their age gap is large, and it seems unrealistic that someone as beautiful as Johansson would end up with an aging Bill Murray. These thoughts should only exist in the minds of those who have not yet seen the film. I do not think this way after watching the events of the film.\n\nI do not like plot summary in a review, as reviews should usually not need them; however, I feel it's necessary to explain some portions of the movie in this case, so I'll start by explaining what the film sets us up with from the start. We're introduced to two (obviously very lonely) souls from completely different walks of life. An aging married man, on a trip to Tokyo for a commercial. He used to act in the movies. Then we see a young married woman, trapped and scared (or \"stuck\", as she puts it) in an area of her life she rushed into, and did not yet mean to be. \n\nThese two are not lovers. These two are not part of a conventional romance like Rose and Jack, Romeo and Juliet, or Maria and Tony, and I'm glad they aren't, because in all honest, they make all of the preceding romances look childish. Bob (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) never introduce themselves to each other, and this presents an aspect of the film that really stood out as genuine. They meet (or at least speak to each other for the first time) at a bar in the quiet, lonely hotel that is their prison. Their conversations flow naturally, and for both people, it is a wonderful excursion from the natural events that take place in their lives.\n\nKeep in mind, neither Bob or Charlotte are in Tokyo for vacation. Charlotte is their for her husband's job, who happens to be gone a lot, leaving her behind with nothing but her thoughts. Bob, already alone, cannot sleep and struggles with his thoughts and his problems and stresses back home. What I loved most about their relationship is its effortless feeling of love and emotion. Watching a film like this, you really can feel their chemistry, watching Murray and Johansson is oddly satisfying, it's wonderful and almost too beautiful. \n\nNow, this would not be the same movie (not that any movie would be) without Coppola's Oscar-winning original screenplay that brings these characters and their quiet love for each other to life. Their conversations are deep and meaningful. Charlotte is a newly married young woman, and Bob is an aging man who has experienced most of life as far as being married and being part of a family. This is a glimpse into Charlotte's future as well as a glimpse into Bob's longing for a past life. They're absolutely perfect for each other, and the casting choices definitely worked.\n\nSpoiling endings in films is usually something I avoid, as should just about anyone talking about a movie. In this case, as \"Lost in Translation\" is a great movie, I need to explain another aspect that I have fallen in love with. The ending in \"Lost in Translation\" is the definition of bitter sweet. I found it difficult throughout this review to accurately describe the beauty of the two main characters in the film and their emotions toward each other, but trust me when I say it's definitely powerful and you WILL care about both of these characters.\n\nWhen reality sets back in on Bob, he knows the time has come to return home to his family and wife. Charlotte knows she must return to her husband and regular life as well. There is no denying the impact that these two had on each other, which many romantic films struggle to find. Before departing, Bob manages to find Charlotte on the street. He hugs her close, and kisses her. It's not like a kiss you would see in \"West Side Story\" or \"Titanic\". It's not charged with physical passion. It is two people who fell in love with each other's emotions, simply saying goodbye, and understanding the bitterness that reality provides.\n\nAfter hugging and kissing Charlotte, Bob whispers something into her ear that the audience is not meant to know. I loved this. We will never know what he said to her, and I'm not sure if I wanted to. Depending on how you felt about the movie, your hopes will vary, and I'm glad the movie was written this way. So what do you hope? Do you want them to meet again? Do you think this was the end? And that, while their relationship was necessary, it's time for a return to normalcy? \n\nIt's sweet and caring of the human spirit, as the film as a whole is.",

He is more experienced in the way of the world, and seems to understand their predicament best; he is trying to steal away from his real life and is avoiding the real issues. She is passive. He is aggressive. She is supportive. He is irascible. They appear to have little in common.\n\nBut they do have one thing. Their situation.\n\nBoth are stuck in a plight which involves loneliness; seemingly infinite isolation. All alone in the vast expanse of Tokyo, where no one can understand them and they can understand no one, they are instantaneously drawn together by way of necessity. Without each other, they may very well go mad. Sleepless nights and alcoholic beverages form the basis for their initial discussions; the warm and welcoming primary colours that light up their faces as they attempt human connection make it difficult not to pay attention. He tries to provide her advice on life, and her young naivety and faith in what she knows provides a subtle but undeniably present retaliation. Contrasting personalities come together in a weak grasp for someone to properly converse with. They wish to break out of their solitary confinement, and in desiring such, find each other.\n\nThey find each other wandering the vast pit of boredom. They're initially tentative, feigning an air of confidence. Bill Murray's character, Bob, exudes wit; Scarlett Johannsson's young wife, Charlotte, is a quiet but intelligent woman. As they begin to unravel each other, carefully unwrapping the person inside, they discover things about themselves. They frolic around Tokyo, exploring restaurants, singing in karaoke bars. There isn't a whole lot of rhyme or reason for their often illustrious and eccentric behavior. They're just happy to escape from the hotel rooms they inhabit all day and all night. He's happy to get away from the suck-ups, and she's elated to just be doing something. There's no huge plot twist that keeps them from coming together. There's no foolish conspiracy, nor are these individuals inconsistent in their motivations. It's really quite simply. These people are lonely, and need someone.\n\nI could write more, but that is ultimately the core to what makes Lost In Translation such a blissful but non-compelling work. It's never anything more than partially engrossing, but perhaps that it is okay. It never aspires to be anything more than what it is, and that is a relaxing, distant foray into a world which proves more comfortable than it does tension-ridden. It's as if it is a dip into a world of remote memories; a warm, lively but indolent realm. It's entertaining and technically proficient, no one can doubt that, but it just isn't substantial nor captivating enough to keep one's interest throughout its slim running time. Perhaps it's that I was incredibly tired when I watched it; undoubtedly, this will require another watch before I can fully cement my opinion on it. All the same, what many consider Sofia Coppola's finest endeavour in the cinematic world I found enjoyable, but nothing immensely outstanding.\n\nThat said, films of this like are what make me irritated at the Academy for not awarding a separate award for lighting. I know many don't notice it, but it makes a hugeimpact on the viewing experience, especially within Lost In Translation. Gaffer Yuji Wada (he worked on Inception, Babel and The Wolverine) deserves an award. The way he lights the dreary and cold streets of Tokyo is gorgeous. Solely due to the prowess of the lighting arrangement and the blue colours utilised all throughout, he makes the location seem stagnant, lifeless and detrimental. It's when the protagonist Bill is interacting with Charlotte that Wada changes the colour palette to something more aesthetically and emotionally pleasing; bold, sensual and affectionate reds begin to invade the frame, and they are utterly enchanting. Ingenious work that genuinely changes the picture for the better, and proves that the gaffer is not a role to be dismissed as minor.",

            "content": "Independent films have come a long way since Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction from 1994.  The film has cemented its status as a landmark film and the beginning of the rise of independent films thanks to its Oscar win for Best Original Screenplay, six additional nominations for Best Picture, Director, Actor, Supporting Actor, Supporting Actress, and Editing, and massive critical and commercial success.  Influence followed thereafter, with new filmmakers such as Wes Anderson, Paul Thomas Anderson, the Coen brothers, and Sofia Coppola.  Coppola may come from a family of filmmakers, and is the father of film legend Francis Ford Coppola, but her filmmaking status has been hit-or-miss recently.  Her newest film The Bling Ring has received criticism from critics and viewers, but some of her old films garnered her lots of resoect and awards.  Her directorial debut The Virgin Suicides received mostly positive responses from critics and audiences, and signaled her as a promising up-and-coming filmmaker that might join the ranks of her father or his friends including George Lucas.  She had an acting career that has since ended (thankfully), but no one cares about that.  Her sophomore effort as director would come with Lost in Translation, a comedy-drama starring Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.  The film follows Murray as Bob Harris, an actor who travels to Tokyo to do an advertisement for Suntory whisky for $2 million.  While there, he meets Charlotte (Johansson), a recent college graduate in Tokyo as well with her husband John (Giovanni Ribisi), a celebrity photographer on business.  Charlotte is usually alone in her hotel room, and leaves to explore the unique culture and sights that Tokyo has to offer.  When Charlotte and Bob meet, they develop a connection and bond by going out on the town, giving them both company in a place unknown to them.  Viewers are introduced to characters who are far away from home, new to Japanese culture, and have only experienced that culture from food they eat at Japanese restaurants or something along those lines (mainly guessing).  They are complete strangers to everyone else, with Charlotte being in a small part of conversations with John and his friends, or people she meets on the town.  Bob is acknowledged by people who know him because of his movies, and he gets phone calls and even mail from his wife at home.  There's not much to be said about them, but that's the point.  Coppola wrote the script in a way to make these characters and the events surrounding them to get \"lost in translation\" (hence the title).  This helps viewers understand how lost they are not only in Tokyo, but in life as well.  The subtlety of their dialogue highlights the journey that have longed to complete, and wonder for what's ahead of them in the future.  This results in a moving, melancholy viewing.  The film however does allow humor into the story, and it blends well with the drama, making the occasional laughs worthwhile.  Coppola wrote, co-produced, and directed the film, and she did a brilliant job with all three of her responsibilities.  With writing, she uses the dialogue and actions of Bob and Charlotte to give them character, while themes of alienation, love, and friendship help drive the film towards a visceral conclusion.  Directing, Sofia utilizes raw emotion from her cast to give depth to their characters, while the visual style symbolizes loneliness (natural lighting has its advantages).  Sofia also uses the backdrop of Tokyo to truly give off the sense of alienation, and succeeds at creating a melancholic atmosphere for viewers.  The cast is brilliant, with Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson firing on all cylinders.  Murray may be a legend with his comedies, but his dramatic side is just as powerful, giving us a moving portrayal of a man struggling with life, aging, and coping with what he has.  Johansson has become popular with Black Widow in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but this role showed what she could bring to a role, giving us a young female with tons of confusion involving life, marraige, and the future.  Crying from subtlety is surprising at times, but the actors make it work thanks to dramatic delivery that feels honest rather than forced.  Giovanni Ribisi is commendable as John, who seems to know Tokyo possibly due to previous jobs he may have had before the events of the film (guessing), and is respectful toward Charlotte, but isn't keen on spending time with her, damaging the relationship.  Anna Faris steals every scene she's in as Kelly, one of John's friends.  It's an admittedly better role than Cindy in the Scary Movie franchise, and she delivers the laughs with success always ringing its bell.  The result of all the hard work on a $4 million budget (independent enough for you?) was over $119 million at the box office, and four Oscar nominations, winning one for Best Orginal Screenplay for Coppola.  The other nominations were Best Picture, Director, and Actor for Murray.  A true art-house film, and one of the greatest independent films of all time.",

Anchored by two effortlessly warm and human performances from both Murray and Johansson, this is beautifully restrained and melancholic creation that simply allows its two richly drawn and incredibly human characters to discover their surroundings and discover themselves for the runtime. Coppola directs elegantly throughout, allowing silences to populate whole minutes whilst subtleties in body language, facial expressions and gestures are nudged to the forefront. Perhaps similar to Her in both tone and in that he presents itself as such an unassuming masterpiece (as well as sharing Johansson), this is a truly special movie in that it gracefully shuns the regular tropes that infect movies of this genre, instead presenting some superlatively restrained acting in a wholeheartedly plausible story and pairing it with some stunning cinematography and direction to craft a movie with pathos and humanity that has inspired love and left me yearning for more.",

A common 'coming of age' type scenario consequently develops, as each of them find refuge with one another. This was presumably expressed by the long moments of silence and intense camera shots that occurred frequently. Whilst somewhat heartwarming, I struggled to develop any emotional attachment to our two leads. This was perhaps partly due to the unnerving, odd flirting that featured. A good soundtrack is perhaps the films only attribute, as it does well in portraying a sense of the unknown. The conclusion too was disappointing and rushed, leaving it debatable whether or not either character had \"found\" themselves at all. Particularly nice scenes and good audio just about prevent this joining the measly two starred films.",

As intelligently made as Lost in Translation was, I must first point out that it moved me on a personal level. I love love. In a world where love is sparse, be that the fault of others or ourselves, the fact that it's always possible to find connection with someone is beautiful, to me. That is the essential theme of Lost in Translation, and for that alone, it's a winner. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johannson have such lighthearted, romantically intense chemistry. They care about each other very much, but would never even give a second thought on abandoning their current lives. They wouldn't want to be a burden on each other. They don't say that to each other though, and it takes a while for them to communicate directly about how they feel. That aspect of their relationship might be why Lost in Translation has its name, not to mention the amusingly isolating environment of Tokyo, Japan. Sofia Coppola shot Tokyo in different ways: as a blank city, as a city crammed with cult ural spectacles for tourists and residents alike, and as a place not home. That changes from scene to scene, and studying the relationship between Bill / Scarlett and the environment can be quite interesting. By the end of the film, I tasted the bittersweetness of their love, found just in the midst of their similar crises. Oh, well. The movie has no reason to leave, and it can always be there to remind you that love is both free and eternal. Bonus points for the great indie rock soundtrack.",

The movie tells the tale of an older insomniac actor who's in Tokyo to shoot a commercial and meets a lonely young girl at the hotel he is staying at. Their loneliness and cultural shock brings them together and forms a 'forbidden' romance. Although the film scored very high ratings, I can only confirm what I expected after seeing it: this is not my cup of tea. I found the whole thing boring. I get the plot, but I just don't like it. I guess I'm not a romantic person. Still, I do agree that Murray is a brilliant actor. \n\nBob Haris (Murray) is an aging actor who's I Tokyo to do a Whisky advertisement. He's alone in a strange city, suffers from insomnia and is going through a midlife crisis questioning his 25 years of marriage. In the bar of his hotel, he meets the young Charlotte (Johansson), who is the wife of a successful photographer and leads a lonely life in her hotel room while her husband is working. Bob and Charlotte come across each other a couple of times and develop a friendship. During a sleepless night Charlotte invites him to a club downtown. Dressed in young clothes Bob accepts her offer.

Dream-like, yet so real and deep. This movie explores two humans by simply watching them. There isn't much background knowledge or flashbacks or 'conflict' starters. Which I find incredibly amazing. As a viewer I cared about these humans because I wanted to, because the movie made me want to through clever camera angles, simple dialogue that is so real, and acting by the absolutely amazing duo of Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.  \nAs the movie progresses I fell deeper and deeper allured by the beautiful scenery and the fantastic soundtrack. All along feeling so sad for its characters. Then happy. Then sad. You start to make morality decisions and even debate whats right or wrong or even just. \nThis movie is magic. So simple.

The pace, the tone, the atmosphere, every element of this movie is used to tell the story. The movie has a purpose. It's about human connection, it's about love, it's about life and how to get through it, all the themes this movie touches on and perfectly weaves together are so relevant and universal for any generation, and it's told in such a beautiful way.

            "content": "Sometimes you come across that film that not only meets your expectations, but goes so far beyond them that you're left absolutely speechless and breathtaken by how well it's executed and how perfectly it's done. Lost in Translation was that way for me, with gorgeous cinematography, fantastic acting, and just an overall beauty in its whole that it's hard for me to put into words.\n\nLost in Translation follows the characters Bob and Charlotte (Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanssen), both very similar but at the same time very different. Charlotte is a young woman married to a photographer that's constantly at work, leaving her alone and attention starved. Bob is a middle-aged, washed up actor in a broken marriage who's going through a mid-life crisis. Both of these characters are in Japan for different reasons: Charlotte's husband is at a photo shoot and Bob is shooting a commercial. The two characters meet and the film chronicles their time together in the huge city of Tokyo, watching as they interact with people and a culture that they both don't understand, and finding solace and a connection through each other.\n\nThis film, as I've stated above, is just absolutely brilliant in its cinematography. Everything that's done with the camera makes absolute sense for the scene and tone that the movie is going for, and everything is shot with a loving detail. Director Sofia Coppola described this film as \"a love letter to Japan\", and just the visuals speak volumes alone. Japan looks absolutely beautiful, from the confusing and strange hustle-bustle of Tokyo to the serene and mysterious sights of Kyoto. There's an equal part representation of the classic and the modern Japanese culture and I absolutely loved every bit of it. But even more so, how the film is shot captures the overarching theme of the film: isolation and alienation. There's this overwhelming awkwardness of our english characters interactions with some of the Japanese norms, from flower arranging to just their appliances. It places you into the shoes of the characters, makes you feel just as confused and out of place as they are. The filmakers brilliantly decided to include no subtitles for the Japanese characters, and this is a stroke of genius when combined with the themes of the movie. This film was also Bill Murray's big transition into a serious role (though he had already found mixed success with films such as Razor's Edge and Rushmore to some degree) and he's probably one of the best parts of an already fantastic movie. Scarlett Johannsen also does a magnificent job, tackling a role that's not the easiest role in the world. At times she's a bit flat, but for the most part she handles her role exceptionally well.\n\nIf you haven't seen Lost In Translation yet, I highly recommend it. This film probably would go down as one of the best films I've ever seen, and I'm at a loss to really think of anything negative to say about it or any reason why someone may not like it. Well, okay, you may not like this film if you're wanting/expecting a conventional, Hollywood ending, because without spoiling the ending that doesn't exactly happen. It's an intelligent little film, it makes you think and to me that's one of the best things a film can do if it entertains you at the same time. And this film more than does that. Definitely go see it if you haven't already.",

            "content": "This film is, in short, a masterpiece.\nIt's not a term I throw around lightly.  And in fact many of my favorite movies fall short of earning that sort of praise.  There are a select few films which I make a point to revisit on a regular basis, most of which end up being of the action, adventure, or sci-fi genres.  The curious thing I have noticed though, is that even the best of those lose their luster over time.  Now I would never oppose a viewing of Gladiator, but the 20th screening loses a bit of its luster.  Lost In Translation, however, never loses its effect.\nIt's a strange thing for such a subdued film to have such a strong impact.  There is no grand cathartic theme.  No world changing stakes.  No life altering tragedy.  It falls into no specific genre.  It isn't a comedy, or a romance, or a hard hitting drama.   Follows no typical arches.  It boasts characters that aren't characters at all.  They are people who live in the real world, who have real world problems that are dealt with in real world ways, by which I mean they are ignored.  Yet despite all of this, it is by far the most compelling film I have ever seen.  \nI love every moment of this movie.  From the incredible awkwardness of the beginning to its heart wrenching ending.  It's a film that makes me both incredibly depressed and incredibly hopeful at the same time.  A feat that you will have to take my word for is a great compliment.  It's also a film in which nearly nothing happens for the duration of its runtime.  It is instead, a series of moments shared between two characters who share a commonality.  They are alone, stuck in a strange city filled with strange people.  But its more than that, they are emotionally disconnected from their lives.  That disconnect is what drives the film.  In a world interconnected in such a way that everyone is a click away from everyone else, it is a concept that seems strange at first.  But it's also one that most people can identify with.  Even the most popular and successful of us feel alone at times.  \nSo all of that and still no mention of the films greatest strength.  It's casting.  Never before have I seen two more perfectly selected leads.  Bill Murray delivers what I consider to be the best performance of his career as an out of touch, declining actor milking the last of his celebrity overseas.  Scarlett Johansson likewise gives the performance of her career as a despondent newlywed searching for her identity.   As unlikely as this pairing is on paper, the chemistry they shared onscreen is undeniable, and is a saving grace for a film which easily could have come across as inappropriate or weird.  Their performances are even more incredible when you factor in that we learn nearly nothing about them.  Their interactions are limited to long silences and vague generalities.  But we know all we need to from their glances and body language.  It's the most fundamental form of acting.  And by far the most difficult.  \nIn my mind, this is easily one of the best films I have ever seen.  And given the vast number of films I have seen, should be counted among the best films ever made.  I recommend it to anyone with a pulse.  10/10",

Only what happens in the present is important to them.\nShe doesn't make it easy to watch. There is this unsaid sexual tension that lingers after Bob and Charlotte are with each other. But rather than take the easy way out Coppola shows us that loneliness isn't solved by an quick one night stand. Friendship is met by several chance meetings at the bar, a glance in the elevator, a phone call to remind each other that \"the more you know who you are and what you want, the less you let things upset you.\"\nLost in Translation is a gem. With its two talented leads, Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson, and Coppola's deft direction, it reminds us that these small pictures can still mean quite a bit.",

The Oscar-winning screenplay is poignantly and painfully realistic - you can plausibly imagine a scenario like this playing out, which is not something you can say of too many movies.\n\nBut by far my favourite part of this film is the lead performance by Bill Murray. It is incredible how much he can convey with a tilt of the head or a wry twist of the mouth. I can't think of a better way to say it than Roger Ebert did: \"Bill Murray's acting in Sofia Coppola's \"Lost in Translation\" is surely one of the most exquisitely controlled performances in recent movies. Without it, the film could be unwatchable. With it, I can't take my eyes away.  Not for a second, not for a frame, does his focus relax, and yet it seems effortless. It's sometimes said of an actor that we can't see him acting. I can't even see him not acting. He seems to be existing, merely existing, in the situation created for him by Sofia Coppola.\"",

            "content": "Oh, Bill Murray, I understand your pain, as I'd imagine it would be mighty easy to get lost in someone trying to interact with you when Scarlett Johansson's in room. Hm, let's see, he got a big comeback, scored a considerable sum of money, an Oscar nomination and a Golden Globe win, and got a vacation to Tokyo with one of the more beautiful women on the planet, so I'm kind of lost as to what Murray has lost with this deal. Maybe it was his soul or something, which would explain why he's been looking really, really old ever since this film (Hollywood doesn't age like this, Bill), and why he had to work with Sofia Coppola to be in this film. Hey, Francis Ford Coppola had to practically sell his soul to make \"The Godfather Part III\" and he ended up stuck with his daughter, and we all suffered because of it. Oh well, it was still an awesome film... to me, at least, and besides, it would appear as though little Sofia finally found her place in showbidnuss, or at least that's what we thought when this film first came out. No, Coppola has had a decent directorial career since 2003 I suppose, but I think she lost something in translation when we gave her an opening to do whatever she wanted to after this film. Oh well, at least we still have this film to keep us going, and yet, quite frankly, even in 2003, I wouldn't have given Coppola the OK to do whatever, because she makes more than a few decisions with this film that are kind of questionable.\r\n\r\nIt's something of a fad to intentionally underdevelop the focuses of a character study when they're ordinary folks, and while an aging actor and the unusually hot wife of a photographer are certainly more interesting than the usual bums films of this type meditate on, some ambiguities is nice, but not to this degree, as immediate development is borderline nonexistent, and gradual exposition is mighty lacking, which is a problem, largely because these are unique characters who are focused on pretty thoroughly to have only so much flesh-out, and partly because this film wastes too much time on dragging. At just barely over 100 minutes, this is a relatively brief affair, but, like I said, expository depth is pretty lacking, so in order to break even, this film spends long, long stretches of time presenting, not excess material, but excess filler, which drags on and on until repetitious ensues, then devolves into an aimlessness that challenges your attention, and whose blandness goes exacerbated by atmospheric limpness. This is one of your livelier Sofia Coppola films I suppose, and yet, the director isn't exactly known for keeping consistent with liveliness, so on top of being underdeveloped and overdrawn, this film further challenges engagement value with a rather cold atmosphere, anchored by dry quietness that typically blands things up and often goes so far as to dull things down. A testament to Coppola's competence as a filmmaker is this film's taking so many heavy blows and ultimately standing as rewarding, regardless of its shortcomings, but make no mistake, there are plenty of shortcomings in development and pacing, and they drag things out and down, challenging your investment, which should be kind of loose to begin with, considering natural shortcomings. This is certainly a meaty little drama, as it takes on plenty of storytelling issues and still stands as quite compelling at the end of the day, but the story that is so problematically told is kind of thin, at least in a sense of consequence, being not too much more than a study on a slice of life, only with a little less development and a little more limpness. The film doesn't go a whole lot of places, and that's a crying shame, because this film could have perhaps gone far, considering that it rewards in spite of storytelling shortcomings' emphasis on natural shortcomings, yet as things stand, natural shortcomings remain prominent, and go stressed enough through characterization and pacing problems for the final product to run the risk of being, if you will, \"lost in underwhelmingness\". Of course, when it's all said and done, while reward value isn't too firmly secured, it surprisingly still stands, compelling you through and through, and even catching your eyes, maybe even your ears, along the way.\r\n\r\nAs quiet as this film is, its soundtrack has become pretty popular, and really, I can't say that I'm blind as to why, because even though the pretty contemporary, relatively obscure songs that are found here and there throughout this film are hit-or-miss, and never hit too hard by their own musical right, some are decent, or at least fitting, livening up the film a bit, though not as much as an original score by Kevin Shields, whose melodic and rather soulful plays with subtle electronica is not only unique, but breathes yet more life into this very modern, very genuine character drama. This is a film driven by a lot of quietness, yet its musical ironically defines its heart, while proving to be attractive more often than not, as surely as Lance Acord's cinematography proves to be consistently attractive, with soft, yet striking color and occasionally rather dreamlike lighting that is always good-looking, but particularly stunning when it accentuates Scarlett Johansson... oh, and, uh, the lively Tokyo locations that this almost environmental character study relies a lot on. I don't know if the film is necessarily a stylistic marvel, but the aesthetic value of the film is relatively outstanding, perhaps even immersive, drawing you into the heart of a drama that, in order to compensate for shortcomings, is going to need worthwhile substance. Like I said, there's something kind of thin about the meat of this character drama, and there is certainly plenty of thinness in this story's underdeveloped and overdrawn execution, but this is still a very genuine, fairly intriguing story concept, with worthy thematic depth and wit that wouldn't be sold as surely as it ultimately is without Sofia Coppola's efforts, at least as the writer of a script that offers sharp dialogue and humor, as well as quite a bit of juice within what characterization there is, further soaked up by a directorial meditativeness that may get to be too limp for its own good, but generally proves to be effective in drawing the subtle depths of this character study. The strengths in storytelling are perhaps more subtle than the flaws, but those subtle touches go a long way in producing a tasteful, if flawed character study that charms, moves and endears thoroughly, yet still runs the risk of collapse into underwhelmingness, from which it is ultimately pried by the onscreen talents. Sure, material is limited for this colorful cast, but most everyone delivers, though not as much as the leads, who really do about as much as anyone or anything in saving the character drama as compelling, with the charismatic Bill Murray being effective as a beloved talent who begins to question the credibility of his career, while the startlingly beautiful Scarlett Johansson, nearing the end of her 17th year (17... Now I feel awkwa-nah, I can't even lie, she was already hot), remarkably convinces as a soft-spoken, but hearty woman who begins to question the path she has taken thus far in adulthood. Of course, it's the chemistry between Murray and Johansson that really drives this film, because as if the charisma between the leads isn't endearing enough, the convincingness of their relationship sells much of the core of this study on two people just trying to get by, and that convincingness is ultimately enough to nudge this film over into thorough compellingness, challenged by storytelling and natural shortcomings, but ultimately firmly secured by rewarding inspiration.\r\n\r\nWhen it's all said, translated and done, underwhelmingness stands as a serious risk, due to serious limitations of expository depth, long stretches of aimless filler, - made all the more glaring by near-dulling atmospheric dryness - and natural limitations in dramatic weight, but through a lively soundtrack, lovely visuals and an endearing story concept, - brought to life by a clever script and thoughtful directorial performance, and truly sold by electric charisma and chemistry between Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson - \"Lost in Translation\" stands as a thoroughly charming and generally quite compelling character study.\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",

This film captures the essence of some true human emotions mostly depression, and loneliness. It is through that loneliness that the two lost souls find each other and a friendship ensues. What I loved about this film, was how it was also a dark comedy on the inside and how the characters were able to poke fun, at some of the situations they were in. The acting was phenomenal, and much credit has to go to the scenery and the way this film was paced. Outside the hotel, the movie made an effort to show off Tokyo as a big and confusing city, which further internalized the characters lost attitude in a strange environment. The characters understand each other so much, that they were willing to put up with each others flaws, just for that human connection they get from each other. All good things come to an end, and same can be said for the characters and this film. Overall I highly recommend viewing this film, and don't be afraid to laugh and then feel deep sympathy for a character few minutes later.",

            "content": "Rarely does a movie make me feel as conflicted as Lost in Translation. In fact, let's put that in a better way: Rarely does a movie make me FEEL. And yes, as a rule, I don't like art-house movies that pretend to be deeper than they really are. But there's something intangible about Lost in Translation that makes you think that its pretentiousness actually has some merit. Sure, it acts like it knows more about people and their relationships than you do... but there are times when you get the sense that it's not just blowing smoke, and it actually does. I'm a proudly cynical and analytical person, but this movie kind of threw me off. And I'm going to try my best to put that sensation into words for this review.\r\n\r\nLost in Translation stars Bill Murray as an American celebrity in Tokyo to do a commercial (and maybe participate in some typically Japanese talk shows). The soul-crushing atmosphere of business trips is pretty much captured here, featuring tiny hotel rooms, bland and unfeeling concrete buildings, and frustrating translation errors. Fortunately for him, he comes across Scarlett Johansson, who (as always) gives the movie a shitload of bonus points from me. Even if Murray is kind of annoying, Johansson is the rare combination of both good acting skills and, well... being easy on the eyes. The two of them begin to bond, and form a friendship that, SOMEHOW, never includes sex. Oh right, spoiler alert-- they never end up doing it. \r\n\r\nThe biggest plot hole here is Johansson's boyfriend. He's constantly complaining. I take offense to this. YOU ARE BANGING SCARLETT JOHANSSON. ACT LIKE IT. STOP BEING SUCH A WHINY BITCH! In fact, even Murray's spouse was fucking obnoxious, to the point of distraction. I get that it was supposed to signify 'trouble at home,' but HOLY FUCK! Why even go on a second date with these people? Also, the movie suffers from a reputation that precedes it-- it's been called one of the best indie films of all time, which frankly, is a bit of an overstatement. It's good, but it's not amazing. Quiet films like this don't set out to do much; they don't try to alter paradigms or change the world of cinema-- so stop acting like they do! It's like being told that The Godfather is the BEST MOVIE EVER for all of your life... and then you see it. No matter how good it is, it will not live up to your now-astronomical expectations. I suppose the appeal for Lost in Translation is pretty across-the-board, but 95%? No fucking way.\r\n\r\nOn to the pros-- and there are a lot of them. Firstly, the movie has a very distinct and very subversive feel that I enjoyed immensely. It accurately depicted what foreign travel is like, depicting a blur of neon lights and cultural differences that is endlessly enjoyable. The depiction of Japanese culture, ranging from karaoke bars to snow-covered pagodas, was very well-done and visually powerful. Sure, it got a little ponderous at times, but this isn't really out to be a gut-busting kind of movie. If anything, it's a dark comedy-- you'll laugh, but you'll be thinking while you do it. \r\n\r\nBut what will you be thinking ABOUT? This is where the movie kind of loses me, as it tries to somehow make this admittedly complicated yet cosmically unimportant platonic friendship be much larger than it actually is. It's a charming and reserved movie, and it will make you feel things... but I'm not quite sure what those things are. Is it supposed to be about how humans interact, and how everyone wants different things out of life? Maybe. You can really decide for yourself, which is both an asset and a fatal flaw to the story. You walk out wondering \"Why was this even made?\" It might be thought-provoking, but when you strip off all of its flashiness and pretty colors, it's just a drawn-out episode of Friends-- NOW WITH MORE VACANT STARES!\r\n\r\nNot to say I didn't like it. In fact, I was entranced. It's a powerful movie that, although somewhat lightweight, carries an indescribable heaviness and bluntness that will both confuse and entertain you. Well... this wasn't a very good review, as reviews are supposed to accurately describe how a movie makes one feel. But the psychedelic, mesmerizing vibe that this movie gives off cannot rightly be put into words. Final Score for Lost in Translation: 6/10 stars. This movie will shake you up, even if it's just for a brief period of time, which makes it definitely worth a viewing. Maybe upon another viewing, I will be able to more eloquently describe this movie's finer points. Until then, you'll have to be satisfied with this. I will say this, however, as a tip for wannabe filmmakers: Don't make the mistake that Lost in Translation does. Don't put the best scene at the very opening moment of the movie.",

The cinematography was also very good. I really liked how it captured the huge size and scope of Tokyo, but it also really captured the story that was happening between these two people as well. Speaking of the two people, these are some of my favorite performances out of Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson. They have this great unforced chemistry together that is really great. I also found both of the characters both likeable and unlikeable, as in there was an equal balance of both. Basically what I'm saying is that they came off as actual flawed human beings, instead of the heroes we're supposed to root for. One more thing about the acting, why does Anna Faris not get more recognition for this movie? She brings a lightness to what otherwise would be a rather dark/dreary movie. She is really funny and is so underrated. My only complaints about this are nitpicky. It could be a little slow at times, and some scenes went on longer than needed for the story. Did we need like 20 minutes of partying and karoke? Eh not really (Although that is one of the places where I loved the cinematography).

It doesn't quite end the way you'd hope but that's what makes it so different and cool, it stands alone from others like it. The movie also made asians out as the stereotypes people came up with, such as them replacing L's with R's when they talk. Wasn't sure if it did it on purpose but it was very clear the actors were pushing that type of talking rather than them just speaking that way naturally.

At the same time, I hate it because it was such a facile representation of Japan basing it all on the two extremes -- the straight-laced, square-ish cutlure, highly structured & dictated by rules & regulations and outlandish  (the outrageous variety show host; the bad boys in the arcade with bleached-blond hair with cigs dangling from their mouth and the uber-stylish strip club). At the end of the day, you can find those extremes EVERYWHERE, not just Japan. (Borat went to the same two extremes in America when he visited the Christian South and gay Miami). But ok, we pardon her for the use of poetic/artistic license because we've come to attach so much mystique withJapan (and perhaps the same could be said for rest of Asia and its people). I watched this movie because of my forthcoming maiden voyage to Tokyo, but after watching it I really only want to go to Kyoto. Damn you Sofia Coppola for ruining all there is fun about this trip --now I think Tokyo is  going to be just like NYC, or London, or Berlin instead of a ultra-modern metropolis with magic unicorns running around in the streets...Touching ending tho.",

It's a connection that ended so soon but will be remembered forever. It is sad, nostalgic, sharply funny and leaves such great impact. It works beautifully because it lets its characters exist in a realistic setting under a rare situation with lesser drama going on.

Their characters are complex, yet similar when they meet, and have an almost innocent connection that is refreshing and also lovable. The simple while subtly layered story is presented in a nicely passionate way filled with certain moments and character actions that will make your heart glow. The wonderful editing and cinematography are naturalistic and filled with open-ended wonder about Tokyo and life and let us enter the story through the characters eyes in a great way. Sophia Coppola's heartfelt and sympathetic direction only hammer in the previous elements giving off a unique, compassionate energy and sense of whimsical detachment that leave the audience in a potent trance of feeling and biter-sweetness. The excellent soundtrack guides us through the setting and story and is filled with sometimes pulsing, melancholy, and often extremely fitting tracks that reflect the emotion on screen and captivate the viewer as well. Overall, this film is a transcendent and meditative experience that works both as a love letter to Tokyo, and a portrait on human connectivity that will leave you both moved and uniquely affected as well.",

I would also like to point out the beautiful scenery and representation of the Japanese culture set up in the film, it is truly carefully made and that deserves credit. The general message in the film is that in a place so isolated from communication and understanding, two complete opposites can become romantics. The film fits in the dark comedy section as it starts on a light hearted note and ends with enough drama to make anyone burst into tears. Lost In Translation is truly a relatable, and represents why there still exists an art to the cinema and the reason why movies were made. Not  as sources of profitable entertainment but as a design and art. This movie will always remain in my top 10 and on my shelf for generations to come.",

He embodies the character so well because he's an aged but still famous movie star just like Bob Harris and it's as if Sofia Coppola has provided Bill Murray with a chance to deal with the situations and turn it into a performance for the viewers to experience which becomes one of his best and significantly more dramatic performances through his long career. Bill Murray seems to awaken a part of him we didn't know existed in Lost in Translation, and it's incredible to witness.\nScarlett Johansson also provides a breakthrough and successfully plays a character much older than she is in a convincing and innocent manner. She creates a great character to mirror Bill Murray, and it's impossible for the audience not to appreciate her presence. \nThe chemistry between the 2 characters is also excellent and strongly defines the generation gap, as well as the fact that regardless of age we all suffer from several issues, such as loneliness, uncertainty and dealing with people who fail to understand translation.\nLost in Translation is held together by it's realism and skills script work and direction from Sofia Coppola, who steps up from her adaptation of The Virgin Suicides and creates a cheaper and more thought provoking film. Her direction cements her status in Hollywood as one of the talented Coppola family members, Alongside Francis Ford Coppola, Talia Shire, Nicolas Cage and more.\n\nThe only flaw in Lost in Translation is that at times there seems to be a lack of stimulation or theme coverage so it's as if there's just time fillers in the running time and can be tedious to the viewer, but aside from that Lost in Translation is one of the best simple cultural examinations since 1969's Easy Rider. Lost in Translation deals with a lot and is simple to sit through, so you can watch it any time of the day in any mood.",

Lost in Translation dishes out supreme drama and charismatic touch and go romance between the two main characters whilst throwing them into a culture where very little relates to the world's they originate from. Sofia Coppola really strikes the viewers hearts with the old, worn-down and bored Bob Harris accompanying the fresh and mislead Charlotte when the former is brought to this new world to advertise whiskey and the latter led through by her new and overambitious husband. Both actors portray their characters with such grace, drama and subtle amusement, wondering such a weird and blinding new landscape, using their hotel as home base. The ending really appeals to the more sensitive viewers side, with the whisper that makes us all ask the inevitable question \"What did he say?\"\n\nWith all this in mind, especially including Bill Murray's serious role with occasional and very well placed humor, alongside Scarlett Johanson's lesser known acting talent and obvious brilliance, Sofia Coppola creates a wonder enchanting film that sits proudly on top of my \"Greatest Films of All Time\" as Number 1.",

There are scenes and moments that are just beautiful and thought provoking, but we have to sit through a lot of dare I say it boring moments just to get to one of these \"good parts.\" The cinematography is elegant, but the urge to be artistic detracts from the sweet story that is being told. On the other hand when we do get these so called \"good parts\" they are well worth it and make us realize why we're sitting through this movie.\n\nCharacters and acting are good. The characters are deeply layered and enhance the film. They're characters that we want to know more about and wish them the better in life. Bill Murray plays a man going through a mid life crisis where he feels like there is a sudden void in his life. Scarlett Johansson is a young girl who is in the infant stages f her marriage and recently graduated, but doesn't know what to do with her life. They both balance each other out and fill in the wholes the other lacks. Their on screen chemistry is sweet, however the romantic aspect often becomes a bit weird.\n\nOverall, \"Lost In Translation\" is a solid film. Its writing is top class, but the overall story is missing that extra \"umph\" to take it to another place. The movie also teeters on boring, but the good parts and the depth are worth the slower pace. I give it 3.5/5, a solid romantic tale.",

Loneliness doesn't always mean that someone is physically separated from loved ones or from people in general. One can be alone in the middle of a crowded room. Bob and Charlotte, the two lonely souls, find each other at a hotel in Japan, spend time with one another, and even sleep in the same bed together. But we know that while this is providing a small comfort for the time being, it is not a lasting solution to their problems. And we also understand that both Bob and Charlotte would still feel lonely--even if Bob's wife were in Tokyo with him, and Charlotte's husband were by her side all the time. Their life struggles lie deeper than what one person can provide, especially the persons they have chosen to settle down with.",

Melancholy in the approach, but moving in the direction, she manages to keep the audience guessing as to what will be the end product of the tension the leads share. However, that is not the purpose, as the main theme of the film is friendship. Coppola does not engage in any fruitless cliches such as sex, but instead delivers a subtle sense of pathos which is balanced by with the occasional humour. Bill Murray's restrained performance is a wonder to behold. Scarlett Johansson is marvelous. The narrative structure is another unsung hero of the film. There isn't a sequence to the events, just a culmination. It's a delicate story of loneliness and thrives on the empathy the viewer experiences. The result is a beautiful, affectionate, and mature cinema on how two people can discover love in an unfamiliar location through friendship.",

I was focused more on how things look around them than the story. I usually like Murray and Johansson, but I feel they were giving irritating roles. Both passive aggressive, and too bitter at life.

First of all, they seem bored in the first third of the movie before they really start spending time with each other. Having been to Tokyo (alone), if you are bored, it is your own fault. There are plenty of things a person by themselves can do, and there are plenty of ways to meet other people (even those that speak English). Also, both of them cheat on their spouses (at least my wife would consider kissing another girl, etc. cheating. And there was emotional cheating as well). I can't really identify with them doing this because there are much more productive solutions. \n\nAdditionally, I didn't really find the funny parts to be funny. Basically the comedy in this movie seemed to rely on making a caricature out of Japanese culture. I won't call it racist like some because it really is representing how many Americans might feel in Japan. I'm also not a PC person and don't have a problem with that type of humor, I just didn't find the execution funny.\n\nAll in all, it was a boring film without a story about two boring people who feel sad for themselves while doing nothing productive to fix their situations.",

            "content": "A really nice film from the very intelligent Sofia Coppola. Bill Murray seems to get better with age- this is just one of a multitude of quality roles from the last 10 years.\n\nLost in Translation tells the story of two Americans, both unsatisfied with their family lives, who meet in Japan. Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is an ageing actor, who's in the Asian country to record a commercial for a whiskey company. Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) is married to a famous photographer who is doing some shoots in Japan. She is left alone by her husband for much of the day and for longer periods while he works. At times, she doesn't believe he is wholly loyal to her, perhaps just a consequence of being left alone so much. Bob has been working so much away from home that he feels a serious disconnect from his wife and kids, who seem to be moving on rapidly with their lives whilst his is going downhill. This is particularly evident during the brief phone calls he shares with his family back home (obviously at strange times due to the different timezones!). Bob and Charlotte meet numerous times in the bar of their hotel and they just talk. That is the power of this film. It never descends into generic territory- no pointless sex, no crudeness, no mindless violence. The two talk and hang out and drink and laugh. They have an obvious connection, which shines out from the screen and is great to watch.\n\nAlmost everything about this film is great. The writing and directing are fluid and vivid, really effective. Johansson plays her role beautifully, and clearly with passion. So far, the best performance of hers I've seen. But the strongest and most memorable point of this film is Mr. Murray. His performance is restrained to the perfect degree. He's a very funny man in real life, and he is darkly and dryly humorous in this film as well, but it's never unnecessarily funny. His character is tired and lost, and Murray portrays that so wonderfully.\n\nThe Japanese setting is obvious enough but effective. The culture shock is one side of it, but the feeling of being lost is also central and a huge city like Tokyo is an obvious place where getting lost is simple.\n\nLost in Translation won many awards and deserved them. It's a splendid film, with great performances. Recommended for all.",

            "content": "(****)  This movie is just baffling to me.  I've really never seen anything like it, and never expected to enjoy anything like it.  Honestly, it could very easily be called boring, but what's crazy is that boredom is a big part of the film, almost the point.  So we see the characters being bored most of the time (granted they're bored in Tokyo, which gives them some cool surrounding scenery).\n\nEssentially, Murray plays a famous American, Bob Harris, who has come to Japan to create an ad campaign.  He has to take photos, film TV spots, etc, which forces him to stay there for several days if not a few weeks.  He frequently gets calls from his wife, who is trying to decide such trivial things as what color carpets to put down, and desperately needs his input.  Meanwhile he is trying to work with people he doesn't even understand while also finding something interesting to do in all his spare time.  The language barrier becomes obvious early on, and plays a constant role in the film.  Interactions with Murray and the Japanese people around him probably contribute most of the straight-up laughs in this film, which aren't too common.\n\nIn fact, the language problem probably leads to his meeting Johansson's character.  Sometimes, when two people are totally out of their element, another person who understands where you're coming from can seem like an old friend.  Charlotte is the wife of a somewhat narcissistic but loving photographer, who is also on a brief trip to Tokyo.  She seems to lead an even more bored and meaningless day-to-day life than Bob.  \n\nThey soon begin to just hang out occasionally, with some Japanese guys they run into.  The interesting part of the film is how their relationship develops, which is very ambiguously.  Like the characters themselves, we're not really sure just how romantic it is, how sexual it is, or whether or not they're doing anything wrong by just being around each other alot.  They are both married, and even at the beginning of the relationship before any fooling around has had a chance to occur, they both wrestle some uncertainty.  Is it wrong to just enjoy being around someone more than your spouse?\n\nNot going to give away the ending, but as we expect the entire film, the clock runs out.  You can't stay in Tokyo forever.  So what will the two do?  I think the ending could not have been handled more perfectly, even though it did leave me a bit frustrated the first time I saw the film.  In the end, this movie is not only a brilliant exploration of human relationships, but also a dead-on observation of the emotions and crazy decisions one can go through when on a long trip, out of your element, away from home, and suddenly someone great steps into your life.",

The main problem which I found was that the film was, quite simply, boring! It was a picaresque narrative and the characters did not have discernible goals or paths throughout the story. It was more about how the story was told (and the characters themselves) than the plot and this caused the entertainment aspect of the film to suffer (it was still intellectually stimulating).
