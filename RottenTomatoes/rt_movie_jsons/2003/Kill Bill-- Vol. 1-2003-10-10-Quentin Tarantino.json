            "content": "A dazzlingly bloody and vengeful rampage, Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill Vol. 1 delivers a high-octane thrill ride that's drenched in homage to classic martial arts and grindhouse cinema. This stylish revenge tale pulls no punches, and audiences will find themselves gasping for breath as they're dragged through an enthralling whirlwind of non-stop action and mesmerizing visuals.\n\nThe narrative centres on Uma Thurman's enigmatic character, The Bride, who embarks on a brutal quest for vengeance against her former teammates and their manipulative leader, Bill. Thurman delivers a powerhouse performance, showcasing her physical prowess and dramatic range as she slices her way through a rogue's gallery of eccentric and dangerous foes.\n\nTarantino's distinctive directorial style is on full display, as he weaves together a tapestry of flashbacks, expertly choreographed fight sequences, and a razor-sharp script. Kill Bill Vol. 1 is an unapologetic love letter to genre cinema, with nods to spaghetti westerns, kung Fu classics, and Japanese samurai films, all underscored by an eclectic soundtrack that will leave your pulse pounding.\n\nThe supporting cast is equally as impressive, with Lucy Liu, Vivica A. Fox, Daryl Hannah, and David Carradine each bringing their respective characters to life with a unique blend of menace and charisma. Special mention must go to the visually arresting set piece that pits Thurman against the deadly Crazy 88, showcasing the creative collaboration between Tarantino and legendary fight choreographer Yuen Woo-Ping.\n\nThough not for the faint of heart, Kill Bill Vol. 1 is a masterclass in filmmaking that revels in its excesses and pushes the boundaries of genre cinema. With its relentless pace, unforgettable characters, and astonishing action sequences, this is one cinematic experience that demands to be seen on the big screen.",

I cannot express in words how much I appreciate this film for it's sole existance itself. Everything about this film is on point and perfect.\n\nUma Thurman plays the lead by giving a performance of a lifetime (believe me she was the Charlize Theron of early 2000s) and you care for her even though you don't know her name (she's referred to as The Bride in the subtitles). They don't even show the main antagonist of the film (not even once) but you are still terrified of him. But the antagonists that are in this film are no less than perfect for the film.\n\nThe main attraction of the film though, is it's action. And my god is it portrayed beautifully. Violent; ofcourse, extremely violent and gory; but it is just so satisfying to see Uma Thurman slash through people stacking bodies.",

            "content": "Uma Thurman and Lucy Liu shine as deadly assassins!\n\nDirector Quentin Tarantino's martial arts revenge thriller Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003) remains an iconic picture. His chaotic and refined style is so dope. From authentic samurai swordplay to insane kung fu fight choreography, Kill Bill is as versatile as it is entertaining. Tarantino lets his love of cinema history and numerous genres guide his bloody path to entertain us throughout Kill Bill. He has drama, moments of humor, and intense action to grip even the most cynical viewer to his frenetic direction. Kill Bill is Tarantino basically adapting Lady Snowblood into a fierce revenge thriller with ruthless intent in Kill Bill.\n\nTarantino's writing is a fascinating declaration of Quentin's love of martial arts films like 36th Chamber of Shaolin, Five Deadly Venoms, Game of Death, to the obvious inspiration of Lady Snowblood. He delivers a killer mash-up of poignant revenge thrillers, gory martial arts swordplay, samurai dramas, and even Spaghetti Westerns like Once Upon a Time in the West. It's so strange that it will go from a blaxploitation kung fu fight to an actual anime sequence from Japan's Production I.G. in visceral style. Tarantino's writing centers around The Bride's inner torment after losing her child, being betrayed, and dealing with her righteous fury. Revenge, forgiveness, and dedication are all major themes in Kill Bill. In combining so many genres, Tarantino makes something new.\n\nEditor Sally Menke's frenetic cutting style can do both hectic sword fights to smooth and gentle conversations. Kill Bill therefore has both a brisk action revenge thriller pace as well as a slow burn contemplative dramatic feel as The Bride prepares for her bloody vengeance. Cinematographer Robert Richardson has the most stunning close-up shots of Uma Thurman and Lucy Liu's breathtaking eyes. I loved the weird angles and perspectives as the camera suddenly shifted to bird's eye perspective above or pan in sweeping motions around a room full of danger. Kill Bill may be Quentin Tarantino's best shot film in hindsight.\n\nUma Thurman's sheer determination to revenge is enthralling as The Bride. Thurman's hurt filled eyes show off a lethal fierceness and tender heartbreak. Her agonized wails are chilling as her bloodthirsty swordplay is exciting. Kill Bill is still Uma Thurman's greatest acting performance. She is hypnotizing and beautiful as Tarantino's ruthless revenge seeker The Bride.\n\nLucy Liu is jaw-droppingly gorgeous as villainess Yakuza leader O-Ren Ishii. Her looks that could kill are mesmerizing with her piercing eyes, harsh words, and dreamy visage. Liu excels as a commanding Yakuza mob boss along with her elegant swordplay. I am amazed by Lucy Liu in Kill Bill and find she steals every scene. Her tragic backstory and sharp performance make her sympathetic just like Thurman's empathetic Bride. I adore Lucy Liu and wish she got other major leading roles like her unforgettable villainess turn in Kill Bill.\n\nDavid Carradine's deep voice is remarkable and brings a heavy gravitas to the unseen villain Bill, who Uma Thurman seeks to assassinate for his betrayal. Vivica A. Fox is sultry and fierce as Vernita Green with her care for her daughter and relentless assault against The Bride. Michael Madsen's mysterious Budd and Daryl Hannah's pretty antagonist Elle Driver are memorable and are set up nicely for Kill Bill: Vol. 2. Julie Dreyfus is excellent as the posh Sofie Fatale with her fun French swearing and Japanese translations.\n\nSonny Chiba's kind and funny swordsmith Hattori Hanz\u014d is a blast. It tells me a lot that Tarantino actually got an old Hollywood legend of martial arts for Kill Bill. He feels nice, wise, experienced, and reflective. Chiaki Kuriyama is cute and crazy as O-Ren's ball and chain wielding bodyguard Gogo Yubari. Martial arts acting icon Gordon Liu has a nice supporting role as Crazy 88 head Johnny Mo, who unleashes endless men and attacks against The Bride. Michael Bowen's vile orderly Buck is truly loathsome. Jun Kunimura is excellent as the upset Yakuza Boss Tanaka, who is upset that Lucy Liu's lovely O-Ren is a foreigner. Kenji Ohba's complaints as Hattori's sake fetcher Shiro is a riot. I enjoyed the cameo from Japanese girl rock group The 5.6.7.8's with their strange blend of surf rock, rockabilly, and punk rock.\n\nProduction designers David Wasco and Yohei Taneda create desolate Western churches, sleek Japanese Yakuza hideouts, and cozy Japanese restaurant sets for Kill Bill. It all looks authentic and mesmerizing. Art direction from Daniel Bradford, Minoru Nishida, Cao Juiping, Hidefumi Hanatani, Lu Yo Lui, and Satoko Saito create slick anime sequences and visceral storyboards. Nothing looks like the gritty neo-noir Western or Japanese samurai revenge thriller aesthetic of Kill Bill. Set decorators Sandy Reynolds-Wasco, Yoshihito Akatsuka, Takashi Sasaki, Mary Saisselin, Peter Davidson, and David Ladish provide realistic props for Japanese bars or katanas on racks for an authentic feel for Kill Bill.\n\nVisual effects artists Frankie Chung, Katsuhito Ishii, and Tommy Tom deliver a sick anime flashback for O'Ren Ishii's tragic and bloody backstory. It's like watching violent combat from Afro Samurai or Samurai Champloo. I loved the massive blood splatters whenever The Bride would dismember someone with her katana or cut someone in half. The violence often looks real.\n\nComposer RZA of Wu-Tang Clan really delivers a beautiful film score for Kill Bill. His ear for swelling symphonic melodies mixed in with harder hip hop drum beats is insane. He carefully provides a melancholic requiem for The Bride as she quests for revenge with venom in her heart. I never knew the Kill Bill theme song was really composed by Bernard Herrmann and was entitled \"Twisted Nerve,\" thanks to the subtitles.\n\nSound designers Harry Cohen, Scott Martin Gershin, Bob Beher, Dino Dimuro, Wylie Stateman, Peter Michael Sullivan, Michael Minkler, John Bires, and Daniel R. Kerr hilariously goes overboard with the shimmering sword sound effects to incessant Wilhelm screams. I liked the bowling pins getting knocked over noises to the loud thuds of a ball and chain hitting The Bride.\n\nCostume designers Catherine Marie Thomas, Kumiko Ogawa, Helen Monaghan, Kanani Wolf, Daniel Grant North, Mark Zunino, and Alexander AD provide iconic yellow jumpsuits for Uma Thurman's The Bride like Bruce Lee's outfit in Game of Death to stunning white kimonos for Lucy Liu's O-Ren Ishii. I loved the striking make-up from artists Ilona Herman, Scott Patton, and Heba Thorisdottir, especially for Uma and Lucy. They simply look marvelous!\n\nOverall, Kill Bill has persevered as a magnificent film full of homages to past pictures and a pleasant mixture of genres with Tarantino's frenetic style. It is a blistering 111 mins of iconic imagery, songs, fights, and fearsome vengeance.",

The thing that makes Kill Bill Vol. 1 so interesting and sets it a part of other Quentin Tarentino movies, is the use of its style. Kill Bill Vol. 1 has black and white, slow motion, animation and so much more, which definitely was fascininating to look at. The action is really well done and Uma Thurman delivers a great performance. Kill Bill Vol. 1 doesnt have the script we expect from Tarentino, however it has some great one liners. The last line of Kill Bill Vol. 1 is definitely one of the biggest cliffhangers ever in a movie and that all before Marvel and DC. Kill Bill Vol. 1 is definitely an interesting setup for the next one and i am curious to see where they take it to.",

The brief appearance of Gordon Liu as their instructor could have came right out of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The rest is typical Quentin Tarantino with him pushing the actors for forced and contrived performances which bury the plot which is ludicrous and yet ends up boring by midway anyway. Tarantino often makes movies that make me cringe, and this was one of the ones that really set up the pattern in his filmography for brutal action with nasty one-liners. None of these actors can really fight in real life, so he brought on Liu for guidance. It's pretty dumb.",

A pregnant hired killer named Black Mamba is shot by a man named Bill during a wedding. But the bullet gets stuck in the woman's head. After lying in a coma for four years, the Bride wakes up. She wants to find those who tried to kill her. Now only revenge will calm the Black Mamba, and she begins to kill all the members of Bill's gang, leaving the leader for last.\n\nThe acting is spectacular. Uma Thurman, playing the Role of the Black Mamba, perfectly conveyed her feelings to the viewer. All the fights in the movie look very believable. As for the soundtracks and special effects, they are fantastic.\n\nAfter all, Kill Bill is one of the best movies I've seenin a long while. It consists of two parts of 2 hours each, but apart from that it's an outstanding film. You shouldn't miss it!",

            "content": "It's official - after only watching 2 Quentin Tarantino films, I'm obsessed. He is such a profound director. Between \"Kill Bill\" and \"Pulp Fiction\" (one of my new favorite movies), there are so many parallel scenes and images. I love little Easter eggs like that. I have also noticed since watching Tarantino films that he goes against usual Hollywood movie guidelines. While most movies include scenes which range from 2-3 minutes, Tarantino's scenes seem to range from 10-15. He does an incredible job at keeping the viewers hooked. I am not huge huge huge on violence (as I find gory violence unnecessary at many times), but I have found both of his film's violence enjoyable. I picked up on how clean the sound effects match with the action (and it's quite satisfying). I'm also in love with Uma Thurman which probably helps my 5 star rating for this movie. It was such a badass savage movie with real girl boss moments - really nicely written and filmed. I actually really liked the switch between live action and almost anime style. I have never seen that in a blockbuster. Another aspect I really fell for was the switch between filters (in the fighting scene where she switches from black and white to true colors). In my opinion (which could be totally misinterpreted), it gave me the impression that in the black and white, she was fighting with old habit and not putting much thought into how she was fighting - it was almost routine-like for her, but when it switched to color, it seemed that she was faced with a true challenge (which she took head on and won). Now I could be completely wrong with this but this is what I took away from it - it was such a creative directorial idea. Overall, I have nothing to critique. I really enjoyed it and it had me hooked the entire way through. Excited to view the 2nd!",

The highlight being the huge bloody sword fight between the protagonist and a crowd of swordsmen. As well as being bloody the film is violent in such a way it can only make you laugh which only Tarantino could do. Kill Bill at times ends up being just a very funny movie. What also helps this movie is a pretty simple storyline where the protagonist  wants revenge on those who wronged her by killing a list of named characters. This is easy to follow and prevents the movie from falling into unnecessary complexity, distracting from what makes the movie so great. The characters are good and the performances are fairly comedic which just adds to the overall feel of the film. Overall, Kill bill is a must-see for any Tarantino fan and isn't to be missed by anyone who likes over the top action and violence.",

This first half of a blistering revenge story delivers a cacophony of varying styles and influences seared into Tarantino's beautifully crazy mind to make something almost entirely original yet manages to stay remarkably cohesive and focused. The story of revenge is an incredibly appealing concept for the plot of a movie and \"Kill Bill: Volume 1\" is no different. Uma Thurman has never been better. She makes \"The Bride\" feel so real, emotional and just a plain-badass. From the opening moments to the cliffhanger ending, I was so enthralled in her plight. The prolonged, climactic \"House of Blue Leaves\" sequence is worth the price of admission. A masterwork in action/camera choreography. I was a bit disappointed at first about the final fight between \"The Bride\" and O-Ren Ishii because of the building anticipation through the film and I wished there was a bit more movement involved as oppose to long pauses. But I realized shortly the whole fight thrives on the suspense in the moment, seeing two formidable warriors measuring each other out, looking for an opportunity to make a hit while being very vigilant of what they opponent is about to do; very reminiscent of shogun showdowns and gun duels of the Old Wild West. So it is refreshing to see a fight that shows more restraint for once and it sizzles. Some can argue this movie functions entirely on flash and style with limited substance and some cartoonish over the top violence. This isn't meant to be all that thought-provoking but it utilizes some of the best qualities of Tarantino's filmmaking: being unpredictable, brisk, vibrantly-shot and masterfully entertaining. This was meant to be an generous, ultra stylish teaser before the actual story to kick and I was begging to see more! - 9/10 (A-)",

I don't vibe with movies where anyone is hacking up other people into bloody bits--man or woman.

They complete each other in so many ways that I think it would be a completely unfair disservice not to, as I would give them both lower scores individually as they have flaws that the other volume makes up for in spades. This was originally intended as a 4 hour epic and BOY does it feel like one without ever slowing down pacing-wise like any movie half as long tends to feel trying to get the same approach. There's a very cheesy, self-indulgent, ultraviolent quality to volume 1 that's endearing and a wise, heartfelt finale with more restraint in the second that balance out perfectly. Together, you can't complain about the heartless violence when you want something more thoughtful or the lack thereof of the former in a revenge flick in the later because you've already had it. I personally prefer volume 2 over 1 because I enjoy the emotional attachment and the brains attached to what seemed like just a silly martial arts movie structured like a video game. It's all so well filmed and made that together make me want to rewatch the whole bloody affair just talking about it. But independently, yes, you could complain that volume 2 is anticlimactic as there's not much violence and that volume 1 is too violent too early, but together you get more than you asked for. Together, long stretches in volume 2 feel like small footnotes in a larger journey, the way they're intended to by the ten chapter structure. Together, this is a pretty complete film. Together, I give Kill Bill: Volumes 1 + 2 (I have not seen \"the whole bloody affair\") a 9.5/10!",

It's got nice choreography and has consistent action. For some reason there's anime, and I hate anime so it's a shame that there was some in the film for what felt like 5-10 minutes. The revenge plot is fine but the fighting was mostly just ridiculously over the top and the fact that she survived the encounter with over 30 enemies is nonsense. I thought Django Unchained and Inglorious Basterds were pretty gory but this was way way worse and excessively over the top. Practically everyone she fought became dismembered. There's a certain level of gore that's just f'd up and really isn't necessary. A lot of the cinematography was good although it felt older than 2003. However, not a big fan of the jumpy, nonlinear timeline in this film.",

I mean a lot of it is in poor taste but so was plenty of innocuous old cinema that it's aping. I mean it's got the music from Ironside, quotes from TV commercials, the censoring of the lead characters name, the suit from Bruce Lee, the sword from Sonny Chiba, an anime backstory, and a Klingon quote to open it all. What the fuck is this? It's messy and stuffed but it flows and it's endlessly entertaining with its little details and flourishes. \nAnd somehow Bill manages to be the coolest motherfucker on the planet with just his voice and his samurai sword caressing hands. \nExuberant and epic.

And have her kill everyone who's done this to her. Ingenious movie that is very underrated.

            "content": "Tarantino's love for the color \"yellow\" is intriguing; understandable, but equally intriguing.\n\nKill Bill Vol. 1\n\nTarantino lyricizes violence in a groovy rhythm. You'd have to have a strong willpower to not cave into his admittedly derived and catchy style. The writer and director Quentin Tarantino is honoring B grade films. In this phase of his filmography, he, with his multiple times collaborator Robert Rodriguez were just goofing around and securing their childhood memories. Tarantino loves those comic book films, not the superhero ones, but the more simple, revenge based commercial cinema that gives its viewers a cathartic release on a weekend after they are pinned down by the entire world. But this \"escaping from reality\" film and the aficionado puppeteering this bloodbath show shouldn't be taken lightly.\n\nGrounding the most elaborative action sequences is Tarantino's finest mythological speech soldering the entire activity. In fact, Django Unchained, which is also created with keeping these very comic book stories in mind, doesn't ever fully circles back to that \"wham\", \"bam\" or \"pow\". In this note, Kill Bill (Vol. 1) succeeds majorly. For instance, despite having three dimensional characters and complex \"he says, she says\" storytelling, the narrator keeps us in check and up to date with all the tracks zooming in front of you.\n\nAlso, every single character is given a proper introduction, a stylish survey and slick one liners or quality to boast off. Take Lucy Liu's storyline for a moment. If she is described, when she is described, the character isn't bogged down by one emotion and isn't showcased like a bad guy. If she assassinated a president, then he isn't portrayed good enough for you to remove yourself apart from her. This is how Tarantino keeps in touch with his audience. He understands what the viewers might feel and would like to feel while going through an array of colorful destruction.",

What a great idea to put a manga anime sequence in a Hollywood film! deckard36\n\u00e2~...\u00e2~...\u00e2~...\u00e2~...  Watched by deckard36 18 Mar, 2019\n\nImagine someone mashing together anime martial arts movies spaghetti westerns and about 10 other genres into one. That's Kill Bill. It's crazy, cool and l totally love it!",

It is a real shame I so dislike volume two because as enjoyable as this film is it still feels very much what it is; the first half of an incomplete story. It undoubtedly helps that I love the films that this Kill Bill opening homages but this is still a movie that works just as well for film novices as it does for genre fans. It is a super stylish and hyper violent odyssey of revenge with Uma Thurman having never been better. She may have seemed like an odd choice when the film was announced but she proved she was more than up for the physical demands of the role. Tarantino amassed a typically eclectic cast with actors seemingly past their peak (Carradine, Hannah), regular collaborators (Thurman, Madsen) and affectionate nods to the stars that directly influenced the film (Chiba, Liu). Together the casting balance is perfect and it is hard to picture any other actors in these roles.\n\nWhilst the opening half an hour is consistently exciting and inventive it is from the stunning animated O-Ren Ishii origin story to the moment the closing credits begin to roll that is perhaps Tarantino\u00e2(TM)s most sustained period of brilliance as a director. The restaurant sequence in particular, essentially a 40-minute extravaganza featuring some of the best action set pieces in the history of cinema, is a real tour de force of filmmaking. The pacing is perfect with Tarantino fully in command of the ebb and flow of an action sequence and, most importantly, how to actually shoot that action so it is easy to follow. I think I could watch the climax of volume one on a permanent loop and never once get bored of its bloody carnage.\n\nThe total package may be flawed but I\u00e2(TM)ll take the series\u00e2(TM) faults when the first film is able to hit such joyous and brilliant heights. Elle Driver\u00e2(TM)s whistling tune (Twisted Nerve) would reverberate back and forth in my ears and drown me out in extreme discomfort. I would become agitated, yet mostly in awe as my body broke out in sweat, certainly flabberghasted, my mind zeroed in on The Bride\u00e2(TM)s iconic yellow tracksuit with her Hanzo\u00e2(TM)s sword clutched tight, lifeless bodies and severed limbs scattered behind \u00e2\" Over the top Anime\u00e2(TM)s gore-soaked carnage - with blood poetically spraying and \u00e2wig flying\u00e2? in the pristine snow. Lucy and Uma; O-Ren and the Bride; Gogo Yubari and the Crazy 88\u00e2\u00a6Not to mention Quantico Tortilla\u00e2(TM)s obvious fixation on toes. Every time I revisit Kill Bill, I feel the same awe again and again. I am totally in love with this movie, it's the reason l wanna be a director. Needless to say, my life has changed ever since. 5/5! (10/10!)",

At this point, it's difficult to tell whether the story as a whole is worth telling - that judgment will have to await the release of Volume 2. But, based on what's available for the time being, I can only recommend Kill Bill for die-hard Tarantino buffs and Hong Kong action junkies. Everyone else would do better to stay away and avoid the bitter disappointment of seeing how the greed of a distributor can degrade the movie-going experience.

From the film's very beginning the film grasps you, and plants its seeds of redemption. Uma Thurman is an all-time legend, and gives a stellar performance. Kill Bill's four act structure is beautifully sequenced, switching from settings such as El Paso, TX, Tokyo, Japan, and Pasadena, CA. Each mise en sc\u00e8ne piques your interest and builds suspense as to what to expect from Uma's next target. (And yes, this assassin works down a death list)\n\nThe resolution was especially satisfying, and seeing her enact her revenge during the film was like turning through the pages of a pop-up book. Kill Bill is a masterpiece in its own right, and I highly recommend watching it.

I consider this movie after Pulp Fiction to be Quentin's best work. And the passion he has for directing shows in this awesome long movie. 4 hours of developed story and well choreographed action scenes. Quentin has such a unique style which I like so very much. I don't see why anyone (except for the Romance lovers out there) wouldn't like this movie.",

Dramatic tension actually builds as she races through Tokyo and stakes out the club. Then begins the downhill slide.\n\nFrom the first ridiculously silly shower-spray of blood from a severed limb, we get a descent from bad to worse. As much as I wanted to see her kill Lucy Liu and \"Bill\" (if she ever gets to him), it just wasn't worth sitting through another 20 minutes of Hanna Barbera cartoon crap.

The story and how Quentin Tarantino shows this movie is phenomenal. The action is great and it doesn't focus on appeal or eye candy, to me that's good for a female lead in any movie and that she's their for business, nothing else.

It's a pure revenge story that's full of twists, blood, action & originality in many different forms -- all in a stylish and ambitious way. The film got a very great inside to the antagonist, & just the fact that the film is aware of the sometimes very forced moments -- well that's just hilarious! Sure it might not be a very dialog-driven film, and it does lack character depth & development.

            "content": "I first recognized the Kill Bill movies back from when I watched a preview montage during the Scream Awards, along with Sin City. \n\nUma Thurman was amazing as the bride. I respect her character for how empowering the bride is as far as moxie, vulnerability and charm she could express. I especially like the rest of the cast such as David, Carradine, Daryl Hannah, Michael Madsen, Sonny Chiba, etc. Lucy Liu as O-Ren or Cottonmouth was both ruthless and pastoral. I think this is Liu's best work in her movie career, since I cannot recall her other work off by heart that is as memorable.\n\nQuintin Tarantino is a phenomenal film director, even if he draws influence from the exploitation movies he adores. In Kill Bill, he pays homage to Lady Snowblood for the portrayal of Cottonmouth, They Call Her One Eye for Elle Driver, and Five Fingers of Death when the screen turns red and music plays as the bride is about to fight Copperhead and Cottonmouth. Plot, too, shares some similarity to the film, The Bride Wore Black. So Tarantino is a man that is able to give quality to films he makes while still interpreting some outlandish moments and zany characters that may appear bizarre in context, but still awesome. Many of his films are good examples of style over substance when it came to employing stunt actions, camera work and overall storytelling.\n\t\nMy one complaint about the film is the extravagant backstory that was given to Cottonmouth. As incredible as the animated sequence was and how much insight it went into, I wish they could have given more elaboration for the other members of the Deadly Viper Squad.\n\nThe fight scenes, namely for the House of Blue Leaves, are masterfully choreographed while still maintaining that action-packed intensity, flourishing from all the swordplay, acrobatics and dismembering. \n\nThis is a glamorous fantasy for a revenge film that appeals to more than just the mainstream audience. I know it sounds like that I am overpraising, but these are the main reasons why I like these films. Kill Bill Volume 1 is made to perfection in a way that I cannot imagine anyone else visualizing better than Tarantino did. You should also watch the following movies that were mentioned to fully appreciate exploitation.",

            "content": "If there's one thing we've learned about Quentin Tarantino as a screenwriter and director is that one should never expect a typical movie that fits the stereotypes of the genre exactly - or even remotely. We had it with Reservoir Dogs, a heist film where we never see the heist, and with both Pulp Fiction and Inglorious Basterds - two more films which take what is typical and throw it aside.\n\nAfter multiple views, I still say that Kill Bill Vol. 1 is by far the stronger half of the duo. The entirety of Volume 1 is very much a build up that never fully stops, which is unique even to revenge flicks as they usually ebb and flow with a lot of changes to the pace. Not so here.\n\nHere was have Tarantino at his flashiest but supplemented with a reservoir of substance which endures throughout the film. The colours and look of the film are all very exaggerated and oversampled, i'm not going to lie, but with such a masterfully woven story, the two go together like Eggs and Bacon, although I doubt highly that Samurai swords are edible.\n\nThe brilliance that lies in Kill Bill is that it doesn't overreach itself. It's a revenge flick with a lot of different elements, but it doesn't try to be something else, or pass itself off as a grand odyssey. Likewise, Tarantino as always adds fantastic dialogue which especially helps the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad during the backstory segmints of the movie. Quentin doesn't just want to make films seriously, he also knows that he can also have fun during the process which is something that a few directors twice his age at the time of Kill Bill have yet to understand or even grasp at it's base sense. \n\nQuentin's casting choices for Kill Bill don't drop the bar either - Uma Thurman returns to the \"Tarantinoverse\" as The Bride, after previously playing Mia Wallace in Pulp Fiction, as does Michael Madsen after previously appearing in Reservoir Dogs as the sociopathic Mr Blonde. Lucy Liu, Darryl Hannah, and Vivica A. Fox all play fellow members of the Deadly Vipers and succeed in establishing that O-Ren Ishii, Elle Driver and Vernita Green are all worthy of the \"badass mofo\" informal title which comes with being a former Deadly Viper. And finally, Bill, who has very little screen time in this first volume, but is masterfully portrayed by David Carradine who seems to be just as good as his half-brother at portraying a maniacal but composed deadly killer. \n\nKill Bill is at it's root, a revenge flick, but at the same time so much more than just that term. It explores territory many others haven't, is loaded with memorable scenes and characters, and a piece of cinematic paradise in terms of the showdown between The Bride and the Crazy 88's.",

            "content": "Tarantino's 2 part homage to Asian and Western cinema, has indeed came under a considerable amount of flack from critics and fans alike, however in retrospect this vibrant and at times excellent homage to his influences has so much on offer, its very hard to hold Kill Bill in such a high disregard. When a former assassin decides to flee her occupation, cutting all ties from her past and trying to settle down and start a family with a normal man, she soon finds herself left for dead and on a war path that will leave anyone who has shares in cleaning products, extremely delighted. Kill Bill Vol 1 is a one hundred mile per hour, violent and homage filled affair, with in jokes aplenty. Taratino is in full fan boy mode, trying to pack in as many bit parts for legends of Asian cinema, taking influence from Game Of Death and crafting an ambitious finale that will most likely be remember for some time to come. Underneath all this however is a very thin and somewhat mucky concept, yes the character of The Bride is indeed a captivating hero, with Uma Thurman crafting the best heroine in forever, with a brilliant motivation and quirky execution, its hard to fault what her and QT deliver here. The same could be said with some of the supporting characters and indeed stories, Bill is a wonderful antagonist, complex and indeed frightening, his ability to be a father figure and lovable makes his actions even more forceful, equally Lucy Lu as the vicious Tokyo warlord also packs not only a strong punch but a wealth of laughs and memorable quotes. The rest of the cast do an admirable job, the problem clearly stems from the over all goal here. Kill Bill has taken a tale that really should be at most, around the 2 hour mark and stretched it so thinly across 2 films and 4 hours. It becomes evident that by the time Kill Bill Vol 1, finally finds its footing it is over, leaving us stacking up an entire plethora of moments that could indeed be cut to make this 1 solid outing. Stepping away from expectations, whats on offer here is brilliant by many makers, the film is gorgeous, full of brilliant colour, excellent framing, well choreographed fight sequences, vibrant buckets of blood, an anime-esque feel to everything and a wealth of comedy and heart that is impossible to ignore. Every act of violence in Kill Bill, is in some cases justified and indeed packing a punch, especially when the film comes close to wrapping up with the insane finale, that will leave gore hounds in a state of euphoria. There is a huge amount on offer here, and if taken on face value, Kill Bill Vol 1 offers enough to get fans wanting more, the problems begin to show however upon closer inspection, and repeated viewing will indeed push the cracks as far as they can stand. An excellent piece of pulp, bright, funny and quirky but lacking the execution we need for a classic. What it does right however will leave most film makers ashamed of their abilities.",

            "content": "I have been watching Tarantino's films in chronological order by release date in preparation for The Hateful Eight. After the intricate drama which was Jackie Brown, Tarantino returns to the use of violence with Kill Bill Vol. 1, and he adds so much more violence to the film than any of his previous 3. We have Kill Bill Vol. 1 using violence as a spectacle in many ways, especially in the climactic \"chapter\" of the film.\n\nLike Jackie Brown, Tarantino decides to go with a female protagonist to portray the powerful woman in modern society. Feminism is a large motif in the first part of the whole bloody affair. Yes, The Bride fights men in this film, but the film's main antagonists are strong women who have worked alongside The Bride in the past. The battles are no longer fought by men, guys; the women in this film put men in their place as they are intelligent, maniacal, but above all, simply bad-a**es.\n\nWhereas Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown were more \"intelligent\" films, this one is probably one of the most fun Tarantino movies to watch. It also has a simple premise/motivation which we have seen often before: revenge. But revenge has never been done quite like this. The blood effects in this film are ridiculous beyond any form of rationality, making certain deaths gruesome but at the same time, somewhat pleasing in a twisted fashion. Not only is anime employed to highlight the background of Lucy Liu's character - Tarantino gets away with huge uses of blood in a more \"appropriate\" manner than if he were to form these scenes as live action segments. It also adds to the idea that the movie is supposed to be fun and cartoonish.\n\nWhereas I have discussed that Tarantino uses dialogue in his first three films to build characters, there is not much \"interesting\" dialogue in this film as much as narrations by The Bride, but this film doesn't seem to need the witty, clever dialogue we are so used to in Quentin Tarantino films.\n\nWith an astounding cliffhanger of an ending, this film makes you crave for more as the credits roll. This is a fun piece of feminist film to say the least, even if the film is desperate for flashbacks and narration at certain moments.\n\n3.5/4.0",

Just to see how it holds up in 2015, I re-watched this one and Vol. 2 this week.\n\nQuentin Tarantino directed this movie and he wrote the story together with lead actress Uma Thurman. Thurman plays Beatrice Kiddo, also known as The Bride, who wakes up from a coma after four years to find that her unborn child is gone and that she was betrayed by a team of assassins that she used to be part of.\n\nThis movie is visually stunning and I also like the many references to other movies, old and new. From the intro screen through cameos to almost carbon copies of certain scenes, this movie seems to be one big tribute to Tarantino's favorites.\n\nWhile slow at the start, the second half of this movie is what it's about. Even though most of the action is deliberately over-the-top brutal and gory, it kind of makes sense in this movie's universe. And even though it supercedes 'story' in this film, I don't have a problem with that.\n\nWhat I do have a problem with, which you will be able to read more about in Vol.2's review, is that this movie was in my humble opinion unnecessarily spread over two installments. And even though this first installment suffers the least from that decision, it is still apparent that this set-up was not conceived from artistic reasons. Don't get me wrong, I really am glad that this movie wasn't released as a single 248-minute endeavour, but I would have liked a little more substance over style. Some of the stuff is clearly too drawn-out.\n\nNo complaints here about the acting and production quality of this movie. It's all high-end. From the cinematography to the dialogue. So while I do have some problems with this movie, I will hold back my negativity until Vol. 2 comes along.\n\nPros: visually stunning, great production value, witty dialogues\nCons: slow, drawn out, unnecessarily cut into two long films.\nVerdict: Still cool",

The action sequences are phenomenally choreographed, and they don't hold back. The brutal and stylized violence make this feel like watching an insane graphic novel coming to life before our eyes. The movie is pure entertainment, thrilling, darkly comic, and entirely memorable. It's impressively executed with such style with a perfect amount of substance right below the surface. The splitting of the story into two parts makes both halves adopt some pacing issues (minor). The last 45 minutes of the movie are incredible and cinematic gold.

The film uses a good technique of comedy to fit it in towards the scenes. \"Kill Bill Vol. 1\" is a good popcorn film that keeps you wanting more. The plot is original as it can be with a twist to shake things up. The movie is shot with a stylistic way all through the movie. Jokes that are pretty funny but sometimes get into the way and distracts you here and there. With a corky script of interesting exposition between characters. Man I was on the edge of my seat when only people are talking. Action scenes are well choreographed and as well realistic. Bloodbaths and chopped off limbs are a big plus for this film. Characters aren't as developed as I like them to be but you still get somewhat of a comfort towards them. With awesome directing and mixing it with color schemes that really stands out. What could be better? A booming soundtrack that fits a variety of scenes and captures the mood to this popcorn film. The movie suffers from the mixed genres that take place. Like I do not know if this is a Comedy, Spoof, Action film straight up, Mystery, etc. Basically this makes you quite confused. The movie seems a little rushed at times. And whenever the movie seems to stumble a little it fails to regain immediately. With boring scenes of limited dialogue or the non-threat of the villains. Overall \"Kill Bill Vol. 1\" is a great watch especially if you have popcorn with you as a snack. Has pretty good re watchability factor. Even though the movie itself is in a way inconsistent and unsure what it is as an whole. Besides my complaints of the film I will give this film an A- grading.",

Tarantino pays fun homage to the genres that inspired him to become a filmmaker: kung fu, spaghetti westerns, revenge thrillers, etc. \n\nThe Bride vs. the Crazy 88 fight sequence is one of the most eye-popping, utterly INCREDIBLE sequences I've seen in a movie.

Tarantino is a great film maker and Kill Bill is a blast from start to finish.\n\nTrue, this might be the less inspired movie he's made so far when it comes to dialogues, instantly classic characters and it plods a little on the desert sequence but I'll be damned if I didn't enjoy every single bit of it. From the explosions of stylistic over the top gore, to the incredible cinematography, to the sheer brilliance of the pacing (giving us new things at every turn), Kill Bill is a difficult movie for those who won't be able to appreciate some of the camp and out of nowhere violent jolts, but all of this weird soup fortunately works together.\n\nI loved this all much more the second time around and I bet I'll love it more on my third.",
