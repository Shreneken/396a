While rummaging in the trash for food on Christmas Eve, they stumble upon an abandoned newborn baby in a trash bin. With only a handful of clues to the baby's identity, the three misfits search the streets of Tokyo for help in returning the baby to its parents.",

            "content": "\"I always wanted to die drunk, in a nice old house. Now I'm halfway there.\"\n\nThe only one of Satoshi Kon's four major projects that doesn't heavily involve surreal, perception-bending elements, Tokyo Godfathers nevertheless touches on the thin boundary between reality and fiction, albeit in a much more subdued way; the film intentionally operates on a series of conincidences that require a suspension of disbelief, eventually becoming near-miraculous, which isn't intended to give off a fairy tale-esque optimism so much as it is a more humane story mechanic contrasting against the stigma of the downtrodden Japanese homeless. Additionally, the premise is evident in the ideas of unconventional social constructs, using Japanese orthodoxy as the 'reality' and offering the makeshift adoptive family of Gin, Hana, and Miyuki as a somewhat imperfect but no less valid alternative. \n\nDemonstrating a sense of detail-oriented visual storytelling, Kon takes a premise that could have been just as well suited to a purely comic vision (three distinctive homeless people coming into unexpected custody of an infant) and trades in most of the hijinks for a dissection of a universal longing for connection and love that each of the characters exhibit, albeit often in eccentric or misguided fashion. On the surface, the film doesn't wield nearly as much weight as some of the writer-director's more overtly philosophical work, nor does it show off Kon's talent for ground-up worldbuilding to its greatest extent, but Tokyo Godfathers ends up a generating a sense of true emotional investment that sidesteps easy emotional points for a more complex story.

The audience is reminded time and again, by the main troika no less, that they are just \"homeless bums\" and not \"action-movie heroes,\" having subjectively ingrained Capitalism's constant devaluation and disenfranchisement of the destitute, and so having to learn to take stock in the singular joy of the loving relationships they share with one another, by no means guaranteed to any of the wealthier (that other kind of godfather, in particular) people that they run across in their adventures. That, of course, is the meaning of the film's nativity setting, which treats the kings as merely side characters and centers the plights and flights of the dispossessed instead.",

La seconda √® la scrittura dei personaggi: sembra che dietro ci sia un accurato studio sulla vita dei clochard della metropoli, i tre protagonisti sono decisamente memorabili.

Taking place on Christmas Eve through a few days the movie follows three homeless people. Gin (Jon Avner) an older man who has a regretful past, Miyuki (Victoria Grace) a run away 15 year old girl and Hana (Shakina Nayfack) a trans women who wishes she could have been a mother. The three of them stumble across an abandoned baby when digging through the trash along with a bag which includes a key. Gin and Miyuki think they should turn the baby into the police, but Hana is persistent that they should try and find the baby's parents and figure out why she was abandoned. What happens next becomes a huge adventure with the three of them running in on a mobsters wedding, an assassination attempt and even a huge car chase through the streets of Tokyo. I really enjoyed this one. I wanted to see it for quite some time and glad to have caught it in theaters. The movie has a lot of heart to it and you figure out the back story of the three main characters. Each has a pretty tragic story and by the end I really cared about what happened to them. The bantering between them all is great and they really have good chemistry. The animation here is wonderful too. The city of Tokyo is alive and it's just not he glamorous shots you're used to seeing. The film shows the \"ugly\" side of things with trash piling on streets and run down apartment buildings. It's a solid film from the late director Satoshi Kon and Shogo Furuya. Definitely, recommend checking this one out!",

There's the drama of finding the kid's mother, the drama of how our 3 protagonists' lives intertwine with their search, good comic levity throughout, some neat little action set pieces, and moving human moments. It's very well rounded in this way and it helps keep the pace moving. It's beautifully animated, the scenery and facial animations especially stood out for me. Some of the sound choices were a little odd though. Through the story the characters are humanized, and you learn to feel for people that you might overlook or mock in your day to day.

This movie tries to do way too much in only 90 minutes. There is backstory for 4 or 5 characters, which means we have at least that many who need some kind of resolution to their stories at the end. It all got muddled for me, and I lost track of where the characters were in relation to one another, and what they were hoping to accomplish. Then there are some odd twists and turns with the mother of the baby that confused me even more, to the point where I just wanted it to end. I‚Äôm generally inclined to like movies a little more that have a Christmas theme to them, and that was the one saving grace in Tokyo Godfathers. It had some heart at the center of the story. Even though the characters were misguided, and made some stupid choices, they meant to do the right thing.

            "content": "I have decided that Tokyo Godfathers is now a quintessential Christmas movie. Directed, written, and produced by the brilliant Satoshi Kon, this heartwarming tale chronicles the Christmas Eve (or perhaps New Years, it's a little unclear) of three homeless people: Hana-san, a transwoman, Miyuki, a teenage runaway, and Gin, a washed up gambler, as they find a baby abandoned in the trash and attempt to return it to its parents.  In the vein of It's a Wonderful Life and a Christmas Carol, the motley crew are confronted with their past and how their departure, sometimes willing sometimes not, from normal society has affected those they left behind.\n\nWhile I won't tell too much without giving away the plot, the movie does give a stark look at definitions and limits of family in modern(ish) Japan, and what that looks like to individuals with incredibly different backgrounds.  And, like Its a Wonderful Life, this movie takes a stark look at suicide and desperation, both increasingly serious problems in Japan.  However, unlike Its a Wonderful Life, it doesn't seem to resolve the big question: should I kill myself?  Instead, it shows what happens to those you leave behind when someone removes themselves from their lives, either through abandonment or suicide.  Despite this, it's an overall happy movie, and I would recommend it for everyone able to understand the depths that desperation can lead to.\n\nWhile I am wholly ignorant of Japan's treatment of queer people, the inclusion of a transwoman as a main character was particularly striking, especially considering this movie came out in 2003 and not, say, after Laverne Cox rose to stardom.  And while the animation and actions of Hana-san are consistent with other representations of gay men in anime, Kon's writing gives this woman a poignancy and realness to her drives, and while her backstory is (surprisingly) probably the least tragic, her desires for bodily womanhood and motherhood are showcased prominently and almost respected by the other characters.  And while the treatment of Hana-san isn't great, it's certainly real, in a way that I haven't always seen in more American stories of queer people before.\n\nMy only previous experience with Satoshi Kon being Paprika, and this movie was a much more muted affair.  Paprika features fantastical characters, bold colours, and surreal dreamscapes, and Tokyo Godfathers most certainly did not.  However, Kon's fanciful writing shows true through the script, with several highly improbable events converging to support the protagonists in a way very much in keeping with other Christmas movies.  His studio's distinctive animation style was nonetheless showcased in this work of fantastical realism, with mild aspects of Looney Toons and animation humor thrown into a couple action sequences and facial expressions during arguments.  Definitely enough to remind you that you weren't watching a drama, but humorous and appropriate.\n\nAnd I'll let you know, Kiyuki does eventually stop crying.\n\n5/5",

The music was quirky and uniquely fitting, and the scenes had an incredibly unique composition. The direction of this movie was very impressive, outstandingly creative. The movie felt like an urban fairy tale.\n\nI watched Your Name not too long ago, so it's still fresh in my head, and it was great. Honestly, but boy, when I contrast Your Name with this, it's so apparent that Tokyo Godfathers is in an entirely different league. You can just see his mastery of this art.\n\nSatoshi Kon was a genius, and it's a damn tragedy that he went away so early in his life. If he manages to make a story about 3 homeless people finding an abandoned baby so compelling and unique, he could do anything. Sad that he won't anymore.\n\nSo do yourself a favor and check out the work he did leave us.",

It's is about a makeshift family of bums that find a thrown out baby in the trash and decide to keep it. They go on a little adventure to find it's parents. Overall, I wasn't impressed at all. I watch a lot of anime nowadays and this was pretty boring compared to most. Very dull, with a few characteristics of what most would perceive as an actual cartoon. That's one of the features that made this bad. Good anime is usually more complicated and serious-toned than most American live-action movies.

Tokyo Godfathers is a surprisingly funny but dark and down-to-earth Christmas movie with an incredibly touching story, complex and relatable characters, and some of the deepest heart-tugging moments I have ever seen in an anime film.

Every character has a story and it all has to do with the past. The movie really gives the viewers a lot of mystery about who the baby belongs to and why was it abandoned in the first place? While during this we get nice hints about the three main characters' stories, like Gin's problem with lying, Hana with his true self, and Miyuki with her father. The amount of story telling presented in this film is strong as again we get an input from the three main characters and other characters who soon come along, all in an hour and a half. There are many movies that try to have two hours or even more and most of the time they can't even keep one single plot consistent (I'm looking at you Micheal Bay). There is no padding as it flows perfectly and really gets a viewer engaged in the movie. There is a very strong emotional power in this film as there are moments of compassion, suspense, and just some well done comedy. I can easily say this is one of my favorite movies that makes me feel multiple emotions. This is easily thanks to the strong themes that are played here about how people long for others or just the past. It's a really strong and relatable feeling and Tokyo Godfathers easily captures with perfection. This is a great example of how someone can explore with the topic of three homeless characters living their lives because as I said before it really goes into deep characterization and strong themes. It is easily my favorite film from Satoshi Kon as not only was it fun film, but a film I can really look back on as an experience.",

The premise itself is simple on paper. but the film turns out to be one crazy ride of emotion, humor, redemption, chase scenes, and a whole lot more. One thing that makes this film so special is that it feels so unpredictable and you never know what's going to happen next, though I shouldn't be surprised by this since it was directed by the same director of films like Millennium Actress and Paprika (Both of which are also really awesome). While some might bash this film for not being like the typical fantasy or sci-fi anime, those people are missing out and it sucks to be them since they can't appreciate something outside of their confined boxes. While I feel cheesy for saying this, Tokyo Godfathers is a truly magical drama that even had me choked up at some parts and laughing constantly throughout. If you are someone who enjoys seeing films outside the box, you must see this superb drama.",

Satoshi Kon is able to pull off the very difficult task of remaining reverent of who/what is at the center of the joke while still pulling off some genuine and funny moments.  The story meanders a bit, but then, so do the protagonists so the pacing fits the film entirely.\n\nWonderful film, targeted towards adults so don't mistake the friendly cover and animated genre to mean that it is for younglings.  This is an intelligent romp through back alleys and closed doors of the heart.",
