    "summary": "In 1987, Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) takes an entry-level job at a Wall Street brokerage firm. By the early 1990s, while still in his 20s, Belfort founds his own firm, Stratton Oakmont. Together with his trusted lieutenant (Jonah Hill) and a merry band of brokers, Belfort makes a huge fortune by defrauding wealthy investors out of millions. However, while Belfort and his cronies partake in a hedonistic brew of sex, drugs and thrills, the SEC and the FBI close in on his empire of excess.",

            "content": "The film, directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Leonardo DiCaprio, was a thrilling portrayal of the wild and debaucherous life of Jordan Belfort, a stockbroker who rose to fame in the 1990s.\n\nDiCaprio's performance was outstanding - he truly embodied the persona of Belfort, making him both charismatic and despicable at the same time. The supporting cast, including Jonah Hill and Margot Robbie, were also fantastic, bringing depth and nuance to their roles.\n\nThe film's pacing was excellent, with a perfect balance of drama, humor, and action. The cinematography was also stunning, with beautiful shots of New York City and other locations. The soundtrack was also excellent, featuring a range of music that perfectly matched the tone of each scene.",

Rob Reiner gives it the full jewish schtick, like a parody of overachievers. DiCaprio gives everything he's got. And that's a lot. His scene with the Lambo and the Ludes with his friend take things to a new level of craziness. And Scorsese makes sure that every expression by the actors, every drunken fall, every lustful look\n is captured. This movie is what makes Hollywood the world capital of entertainment.

            "content": "The plot of \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" was very interesting. It has a very unique plot unlike most movie or book plots, it felt very original.This movie is based on a true story and it shares the life story of a business CEO, Jordan Belfort, who ran a large company on Wall Street in the 90s and early 2000s. He used stock tactics to con people out of money while making millions for himself. I thought there were a lot of different things that happened to keep the viewer entertained, it was a comedy and with jokes for all ages. I felt that the timeline of this movie was also very organized, it wasn't confusing or hard to follow along with the story. \n One of the main focuses in the movie was Jordan Befort's addiction to drugs. I thought the movie did a nice job of showing how drugs really ruin your life. It didn't over glorify drugs which a lot of movies do and it left you with a nice and important message.\nThe ending of this movie was pretty intense but it did wrap up everything nicely, there weren't a lot of lingering questions.The ending was also realistic, not everything works out perfectly. If you are someone who likes very happy endings this movie might not be the best for you but on the other hand if you're someone who likes realistic endings you will probably really enjoy this movie. \nAll the actors in this movie did a really nice job acting. They all really embodied their characters. I felt like each character seemed real, it didn't feel like actors were just playing a role. Margot Robbie did a good job making me really believe her character was a real person and that she was a loving wife. They all were able to demonstrate multiple sides to their characters and portray a lot of different emotions within them which can be very hard for an actor to do. I thought Leonardo Dicaprio did the best job at this while playing Jordan Befort. He was able to convince me that he was actually high during his drug scenes and was able to convince me he was actually crazy during some of his other scenes. \nI felt the script was really good. The script was written with a satire element to bring the story to life to explain how the events felt from the perspective of the main character. There weren't really any scenes that stood out as being cringy, but there were a lot of scenes that were unrealistic in a satire way.\nThis is a very long movie so if you're someone who has a short attention span it might be hard to stay engaged. I felt the middle of this movie had a lot of scenes that developed the story line and kept the watcher engaged. There were many scenes that explained the work life and the home life of the main character, Jordan Belfort, which helps the viewer get more insight into his experiences and what Wall Street was like.",

            "content": "I can't recommend it.  To be fair, this movie is well-acted, sleek, fun to look at, and has some entertaining lines in it.  Margot Robbie, as the hottest woman in the world, does not disappoint.  DiCaprio is great at always.\n\nBut the message really is sickening, and gratuitously so in a way that it didn't have to be.  The 2 hours of rich criminals gorging the best drugs, hookers, yachts and mansions is all par for the course, but there's never a sense of any of it being destructive, immoral or having any real consequences.  In truth, tons of real people got conned and lost their life savings, and their story isn't even hinted about.  \n\nThere was never going to be any proper comeuppance for the amount of luxury Belfort grifted his way to for a decade, but \"3 years playing tennis in a country club prison and then a speaking tour\" is a slap in the face, and then showing the real Jordan Belfort partying it up with DiCaprio is a bigger slap in the face.  And it's all done with a wink to the audience and with engaging jokes and infectious mania, as though this character is really just a lovable \"boys will be boys\" scamp.  Rather than it being a cautionary tale about literally anything, it screams through the screen \"Just be as greedy, Narcissistic, abusive and hedonistic as you want, and even when it all falls apart, m'eh, it's a slap on the wrist for you while every one of your victims suffers in silent irrelevance.\n\nI am not against movies where everything is unfairly tilted toward the heroes, but usually those heroes are either fighters that painstakingly earn such a victory, class clowns that the audience can live vicariously through the dumb luck of, or ordinary people who deserve some positivity in their lives.  This movie takes a drug-addled criminal psychopath, enables him throughout, whitewashes his image and then begs the audience to associate his greed with endlessly perfect breasts and chemical highs and applause.  Even in A Clockwork Orange, the villains got a better lesson than this.",

DiCaprio is great in the lead role, as are Jonah Hill as his drug-addled friend and business associate Donnie Azoff and Margot Robbie as Jordan's exasperated wife.  Other than some of the worst continuity that you'll ever see in a major, big-budget film, there isn't much to dislike about The Wolf of Wall Street, unless you are offended by excessive drug use, midget tossing, vulgar language, and plenty of sex, all of which seem to be part of the game when dealing with characters of this nature.",

DiCaprio is on fire and yet somehow is surpassed by Jonah Hill, who easily earns my MVP on this watch.

Another brutally depressing scene was the marriage problems between Naomi and Leonardo, which was bad enough with the yelling, cussing and violence but my stomach dropped when they had to get the kid involved, and it's so depressing to know this is what happens, and that not everyone in life has it easy, even the rich. This is honestly a movie that I would self reflect on, as Jordan Belfort is in a strange way a role model: by the end, he realises the corruption of Money and how life is better without materialism in mind, best summed up by the quote at the top.",

On top of that, They sublimely illustrate intricate character development, where he's practically an utterly different person towards the end, due to losing himself to greed & ultimately being morally conflicted- thereby making questionable decisions.

The dialogue is a joy, with the lunch scene between Jordan Belfort (DiCaprio) and Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey), the scene when \"the main group\" is discussing the little person's rights for their party, and, of course, Belfort's pump-up speeches. How does the chest-beating not get your juices flowing?? I'm not sure if I have a favorite scene, but the \"deposition scene\" has stuck with me since 2013, especially Kenneth Choi's character. Don't get lost in all of the champagne and Quaaludes and cocaine and vodka, there's some really good information here about what Wall Street actually makes: nothing. Nothing tangible, that is. They don't create anything or (really) perform a service. McConaughey lays it out for you in the first 20 minutes. But you came for the yacht parties, prostitutes, helicopters, and drugs, and there's plenty of that. I loved the soundtrack \u2014 the usage of Laura Branigan's \"Gloria\" was sublime. I would've appreciated a \"where are they now\" of the main gang, but I suppose we were already at three hours. The Wolf of Wall Street is my type of big-budget movie.",

Regardless of how the actual person being portrayed lived at that time, Scorsese did not have to resort to the lengths that he went to in order to show the events that took place. Why such a renowned director allowed such gratuitous language and sexual content does nothing to add to the story and in fact detracts from the already stellar performance given by DiCaprio. Instead of truly examining the negative consequences of Jordan Belfort\u2019s lifestyle, it portrays drug use and sex as humorous and without consequence. I was shocked to learn that this was in fact a Martin Scorsese film because it is so immature and lacks any depth. Instead of being objective about the life of this individual, Scorsese\u2019s choices in this film don\u2019t tell the audience that what Jordan Belfort did was wrong and instead becomes so involved with the \u201cfun\u201d of it that it feels like he\u2019s mocking any sense of responsibility or accountability for one\u2019s actions. Rather than have a morality at the core of the film, it arrogantly mocks morality. Unfortunately instead of it being really examined, Scorsese\u2019s name being attached to it leads people believe it to be a masterpiece, and inflates the ego of a progressively ineffective director.

It doesn't delve too deep into the details of how Belfort did what he did, but instead focuses on the rambunctious characters and the more extravagant, salacious parts of their lifestyles. The cast, lead by a charismatic DiCaprio at the top of his game, is so entertaining to watch that the 3 hr run time almost flies by. Now, you could argue (and you'd be right) that Scorsese is glorifying Belfort's lifestyle and crimes, almost inviting the audience (who, let's face it, is almost certainly going to be mostly guys) to envy, if not flat out admire him in some sort of twisted way; to imagine how much fun it'd be to be him.

            "content": "Scorsese organizes the chaos of Wall Street white collar crime.\n\nDirector Martin Scorsese's crime comedy The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) is like getting hit by lightning while Leonardo DiCaprio screams in your face. It's a trip. Witness Wall Street's wolf Jordan Belfort as he convinces every young stockbroker to work for him to get paid and get laid. The price of being rich is eventually either jail or taxes, but the journey there is paved in luxury women, brand new expensive cars, hard drugs, and tailored suits with a prepared speech ready to get you to buy stocks to become rich at any cost. \n\nMartin Scorsese's direction is like getting punched in the face with a bowling ball. The Wolf of Wall Street is legit 3 hours long and feels like a half hour sports car race. Only Scorsese could make 180 minutes feel like 30 with a constant influx of stacks of  information, hilarious jokes, drug highs, and shocking orgies. We go from Belfort's poor beginnings into the actual daily stock trade calls from his startup firm, to the insane partying like no other film I've ever seen. \n\nJordan Belfort's sheer audacity, pure arrogance, constant lying, gross prideful narcissism, blatant criminal stock trading, illegal money hiding in Swiss bank accounts, money laundering, and reckless spending were his fatal flaw. Scorsese paints a picture of Belfort as a charismatic, egomaniac who needed to be stopped whether for the ethical reasons of his law breaking or the moral reasons as he ripped off hundreds of shareholders of millions of dollars. Belfort certainly left his own trail of victims. \n\nWriter Terence Winter gives you every aspect and moment of Belfort's life. From naked beautiful women, hot strippers, pretty escorts, gorgeous wives, nice yachts, private planes, private helicopters, to mansions like you've never seen. Cheating on a scale you could not calculate. Endless lies, constant manipulation of investors and wives. It's all fraud, it's all illegal, and he got away with it for years. Belfort was quite the motivational speaker. He got all his employees to admire him, be loyal to him, and aspire to be him. He looked like he had it all, but behind the limelight are the shadows.\n\nFallen firm, penny stocks, to major blue stocks. From ripping off ignorant new investors with penny stocks to the 1 percent of their wealth. Launching an IPO for shoe designer Steve Madden in the midst of debauchery. Belfort was a self made stockbroker CEO and genius stock trader, yet he could not do it legitly, so it cost him everything. You hate the guy, yet I have to admit he really ended up getting away with everything in a way since he's doing just fine.\n\nBelfort had SEC and FBI investigations and enquiries after him, which leads to surveillance in his home and phone taps on his lines. The federal government took tabs and observed everything Belfort did as the FBI prepped their case before sending subpoenas to Wall Street's most infamous stockbroker fraud ever. Belfort even tried to bribe and influence The Federal Bureau of Intelligence. The brass balls on this guy were unbelievable.\n\nCocaine, quaaludes, crack, weed, morphine, led to drug addiction and sex addiction. Let alone all the money dealing addiction or what I might call deplorable greed. Leonardo DiCaprio's acting is absolutely hilarious during his iconic quaalude drug trip sequence wherein he loses all motor function. The Wolf of Wall Street has to be Leo's funniest role and is like a logical extension of his con artist from Catch Me If You Can, Howard Hughes from The Aviator, and Jay Gatsby from The Great Gatsby. DiCaprio portrays Jordan Belfort as the real life Gordon Gecko from Oliver Stone's Wall Street. Only Leonardo DiCaprio could express such exhilarating energy, erratic humor, absorbing charisma, and striking drama as Belfort's unreal life experiences are on full display.\n\nThelma Schoonmaker's editing is structured rigidly and flows effortlessly from trades to sex to traitors in a flash. Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography makes great use of the enormous amount of extras and bright lighting with his creative and playful wide shots. His close-ups are hard hitting and let you focus on the earnest character moments, but so much of The Wolf of Wall Street is Prieto's tasteful wide shots of Belfort's deals and parties.\n\nBob Shaw's production design recreates 80's Wall Street to a tee, whether it is the yachts, mansions, or stock market offices. Ellen Christiansen's set decoration is so perfectly tacky, bright, and gaudy, exactly right for Belfort's lavish tastes. Sandy Powell's costumes are immaculate to the late 80's and early 90's era with a fashionable spark. Mindy Hall's make-up has everyone done up to the nines with sleek style.\n\nAll the supporting roles are incredible from the drop dead gorgeous Margot Robbi as Belfort's wife Naomi Lapaglia. She gives it her all from full frontal nudity to her subtle dramatic acting with her inner disdain for Jordan to her crazy fights with Belfort. Jonah Hill is a riot as the partying stockbroker executive Donnie Azoff. Kyle Chandler is thoughtful and intense as the FBI agent Patrick Denham, who follows Belfort's paper trail. Rob Reiner goes nuts as Belfort's father, Jon Bernthal is a quaalude dealer turned money smuggler for Belfort, Matthew McConaughey sets the tone as the cringe inducing off the wall stock trader CEO who mentors Belfort, and Jean Dujardin is funny as the Swiss banker Belfort uses to hide money in Switzerland's tax haven banks. Cristin Milioti is tender, lovely, and funny as Belfort's first wife Teresa Petrillo.\n\nIn all, The Wolf of Wall Street is Martin Scorsese's most instantly entertaining and funny picture as he captures Jordan Belfort's exploits, excesses, and irresponsible actions.",

Leonardo Dicaprio pulls off a career defining performance as the slimily charismatic Jordan Belfort, a penny stock pusher who ends up screwing over thousands of people. Scorsese shows the excess and extravagance of this horrible character, but he doesn't sympathize with the character. The character boasts about their exploits and life, but what Scorsese does is show how that seemingly great life begins to crumble down as the film progresses. He isn't a role model, and whatever he did to cut corners and become a rich man becomes his hinderance as the film moves on. Its a brilliant tale, which also shows how regular and moral based individuals also get affected by characters like this. Many people might criticize this film for its over indulgence and its over the top sequences, but its necessary to show the film this way, as it shows that whatever seems like a great time, might not be that way. With some amazing acting, great directing, and an interesting character arc, The Wolf Of Wall Street is one of Scorsese's best, and quite possibly one of his more underrated films.",

Thank you Martin Scorsese. The film is engaging, funny, and even at times like the ending, thought provoking. Scorsese does a phenomenal job highlighting what life was probably like at Stratton Oakmont, a real company that was lower than pond scum and scammed the hell out of thousands. The story of Belfort is also incredible and well complimented by Leos phenomenal acting. Can we also get a nod for Jonah Hill and Margot? They acted the hell out of their roles! This is the best acting I've seen in a film hands down. The dedication to the characters by the cast is unmatched by any other film in the last ten or so years.

Phenomenal actor! He is outstanding here as Jordan Belfort, the guy this film is based upon. As noted, I didn't really ever care for Jordan but DiCaprio makes it impossible not to enjoy watching events throughout.\n\nJonah Hill (Donnie) comes in with a very good performance, the type of which I hadn't previously seen from him; closest being, in terms of quality, 'Moneyball'. Margot Robbie, meanwhile, isn't easy to forget as Naomi. Though none of the following standout big, it's pleasant to see Jon Bernthal, Matthew McConaughey and Jon Favreau, among others, appear.\n\nThe almost three hour run time, aside from a couple of moments, goes by fairly quickly. A big reason for that is the sheer bonkers nature of the plot, which goes in so many different directions it's impressive.

Despite the massive run time it's a movie that everyone has literally seen and wants to watch over and over. It's just such a crazy and wild ride throughout. Jordan Belfort's rise and fall is just a mental story. It's one that if you didn't know it was true you would not believe. The things he does and gets up to are quite incredible. Drunk driving a helicopter though is something that I personally would not want to try. The rise of his company is amazing and how they got to the top is an even crazier story. It's one you have to see. \n\nYou also need to see this movie as it's the greatest performance of Leo's career. That is quite some achievement as he's usually incredible in anything he's in. This movie though for me is his pinnacle. He may not have won an Oscar for the film but he was extremely unfortunate not to. He won an Oscar for The Revenant but for me he was given that as the award show realised they did him wrong by not giving him one for his performance here. The amount of energy and charisma he exudes in this film is incredible. Every time he's on screen he makes it wroth your while. He captures your attention with his performance throughout and he nails every different scenario he's thrown into. It is truly one of the greatest performances of our time and it's one that will be spoken about for years to come. \n\nQuite honestly when you have Leo and Scorsese together in a film you have a winning formula. They've combined before for greats such as The Departed & Shutter Island. Anytime they combine it just works. Scorsese really brings the best our of Leo and when he's at his best there's not many actors like him. \n\nYou may or may not have been put off in the past because of the long run time of this film but believe me it is worth the 3 hours of your time. The amount of craziness on screen combined with some absolute belters of performances make it go quickly. Not only is Leo at his best but this is one Jonah Hill's best ever performances as well. He's another top actor who here gives us a perfect complimentary performance to Leo. Margot Robie as well just exudes sex appeal. I don't think we will ever have a performance like hers again. She literally is perfection in this role and now she's one of the biggest stars in Hollywood all from her brilliant performance here. \n\nThe Wolf Of Wall Street is one of the best biopics ever made. Jordan Belfort is a really detestable person but Leo brings so many different sides of him to the screen. It really is a film that every single person must see. There's so many reasons you must see it. To think this is a true story is still something that blows me away. If you haven't seen it now is finally the time for you to sit down for an afternoon or evening and watch it. Trust me you'll love it. \n\nCheck out my site LifeLowdown.com for more Film & TV news!",

            "content": "Martin Scorsese's \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" is a bold, darkly comic and extremely entertaining biopic that sheds light on the hedonistic life of Jordan Belfort. With his twenty-third feature, Scorsese crafted an exhilarating film about the outrageous life of  Jordan Belfort. It's the filmmaker's first attempt to dramatize the hedonistic life of a corrupt stockbroker on Wall Street, but he pulls it off seamlessly. Using captivating cinematography, Scorsese draws viewers into the world of a corrupt scammer. Scorsese effectively employs fourth-wall-breaking shots to put viewers into the deranged mindset of the main character. In terms of writing, the film is elevated by an exceptional screenplay. Terrence Winter's screenplay is spectacular, and expertly uses voice-over narration to tell Jordan Belfort's outrageous life story. It is hard to not admire the astonishing performances from the cast. Leonardo DiCaprio delivers one of the best performances of his career as Jordan Belfort. This is the actor unlike you've ever seen him before: intense, charismatic and reprehensible in his first ever comedic role. The supporting cast, which includes the scene-stealing Jonah Hill, is also excellent and worthy of recognition. Although \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" is undeniably exhilarating, ultimately it is not a flawless film. At nearly three hours, it suffers from a lengthy running-time that tests the viewer's patience. Moreover, the film's graphic depiction of sex, drug abuse and debauchery may not appeal towards everyone. Nevertheless, fans of Martin Scorsese will definitely enjoy \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" and so will movie-goers seeking exhilarating entertainment. At a time when Jordan Belfort remains a controversial public figure in America, it's a rousing reminder that the lives of scandalous stockbrokers are worth depicting on the big-screen.",

Talking about Producers I wasn't even that Surprised when I read that Emma Tillinger Koskoff produced as well if you know that she often worked with Scorsese before. I guess that the Movie would be Phenomenal if the Runningtime would've been 2h 35min or so, but I absolutely loved it like it is with its 3h Runningtime and I kinda hoped that it wouldn't End.

By taking authentic source material, while slightly deviating it from the truth, he created this MASTERPIECE, inspired by Jordan Belfort's real story, and his autobiographies.\n\nTerrance Winter & Martin Scorsese did a PHENOMENAL job telling this story. The narrative has so many memorable scenes, amd tremendous layers, that holds so much rewatch value! After watching countless videos on the true story, and what the real Jordan Belfort (who was also on set for the production) thought; all of these seemed to be fantasy's, were almost all true, and immaculately presented! According to Belfort, Scorsese & Winter's dumbed things down! Not only was this the best paced out, three hour film I've seen, but probably one of the greatest films I've seen, in general - I was so intrigued from minute one, all the way to minute one-hundred-eighty!\n\nThe screenplay by Winter's was super creative & and so much fun! He added so many great layers to each character, giving them their own distinct personalities. The script was so vulgar, yet very witty, while still being ridiculously funny.\n\nEven though Martin Scorsese & Terrace Winter's flipped some of the names, and some being made up completely, due to secrecy reasons, this A-list cast had such inspiring charisma, and displayed all the real actions, tremendously! I have seen A LOT of films, and more than a few Dicaprio films, but this was hands down the best acting I've seen across a cast, but giving tremendous credit to Leonardo DiCaprio, who got snubbed for an Academy Award for his performance! His anti-hero swagger, with such an engrossing personality, brought an abundance of charm, wit, and tons of comedy to this film. His love life was also nailed to a T! Margot Robbie's character development in the third act compliments the tone it was going for. The way Scorsese displays their relationship was pretty accurate, almost all the way down the line. Dan Porush, named Donnie Azoff in the film, played by Jonah Hill, is Jordan's second in command. Jonah Hill put on a FANTASTIC performance; definitely my favorite performance of his. I also thought Jonah Hill was snubbed for an Academy Award. Jonah Hill embodied Dan Porush to a T, down to his wife, his ambitions attitude, and everything else around it. As far as the strattonites go, in Henry Zebrowski, Kenneth Choi, Brian Sacca, Jon Bernthal & P.J Byne, they had the most chaotic roles out of everyone, on the side of Leo. Every character knew their role, and played it to perfection. I loved Rob Reiner in this film, even though he wasn't that important. His crazy dad attitude was displayed clear as crystal, and was an overall great addition! Matthew McConaughey had another small, but important role in Jordan Belfort's character development. After doing further research, McConaughey had a lot more of an impact than his screen time allowed. One of my favorite additions to this film, was Bo Dietl, playing Belfort's PI. Bo Dietl was the actual PI of the real Jordan Belfort. His character was just another small, but necessary addition, with such an effortless performance, due to Dietl playing himself.\n\nThe editing by probably one of the most credible editors in the game, in Thelma Shoonmaker, who edited all of Scorsese's films, had a tough task at hand. This film was 3 hours long, so I can only imagine how many deleted scenes there were, and what the run-time would've actually been, without so many cuts, and mashes. Shoonmaker did make some scenes a little obvious that they were two scenes mashed together, or shot at different times, but it's hard to fault someone with that much on their plate, with that much of a hefty resum\u00e9.\n\nOverall, this is in my top five FAVORITE films of all time, and I HIGHLY recommend this film. Another film you MUST see before you die.",

            "content": "What can I say. The wolf of wall street is an undoubtedly a popular motion picture, for reasons I am yet to discover. I don't think it is fair to discredit what an incredible actor our star Leonardo Decaprico is, but I'm happy to poke enough holes in the storyline so that it falls apart. \n\nJordan Belford, simply a con artist who, when he captured onto trickery and deceitfulness ,used  it to gain power and wealth beyond belief. Belford abused this wealth, commonly using it on drugs and hookers.  He didn't care about the wellbeing of others even those he seemed most close to such as his wife. His wife, played by the infamous Margot Robbie, was a blonde bimbo of a trophy wife. Who was abused emotionally, physically and once sexually by her greedy power hungry husband. I, personally, am terrified that this movie is based upon real life events and makes me disappointed to live in a world where men can rise through the ranks so much so that this behaviour is justified by wealth and social standing.  \n\nLet's go into the storyline. I watched this movie across three days, each time thinking \"when the hell is this going to conclude\". For a movie that runs for three hours the narrative was very repetitive. Switching commonly between three themes, drugs, sex and shady office work. When we weren't watching bouncing breasts bobbing up and down on the screen, we were probably seeing Belford and his co-workers  snorting long lines of cocaine. For all those who say that Belford was a genius when it came to business and trading, I beg you to remember the very first scene of the movie when we see Belford snorting, what I'm assuming is his favourite drug, cocaine out of one of his prized hookers asses. The question must be asked; was he really all that? Or was he just a lucky fella who, though once was a nice person with some sense of human decency, became cocky, conceded and abusive when given power and wealth?  The reality is. Jordan Belford was a mad man. Driven crazy with limitless boundaries. \n\nAs stated profoundly above, I think that Leo's acting cannot be overlooked here. It's no short of brilliant as he completely takes the form of any and all characters he portrays. His Oscar that he strived for wasn't won for his acting within wolf of wall street but instead won for a seemingly irrelevant movie that isn't even mentioned nowadays which is a true shame in my opinion. Because if you're going to make a three hour movie where in which you embarrass yourself with shoddy scripture and a bore of a storyline you might as well (as Leo did) do it well, and win an Oscar for it. Margot Robbie is in this movie alongside the predominant Jonah Hill both stand beside Leo in shining glory in regards to their dedication and acting. Margot Robbie in her dazzling beauty won over I'm sure everyone who watched her on the screen in wolf of wall street. Though to her beauty didn't come much intelligence or wit. Jonah Hill who loyally did drugs with Jordan,  stood beside him throughout his illegal dealings and basked in the limelight enjoying strippers and hookers. The two men though thick and thin became joint at the hip, needing crazier and crazier things to keep them going. The scene in which they were almost paralysed due to taking expired pills, leading them to stumble around like bumbling idiots was slightly ridiculous. \n\nAll in all I think The Wolf of Wall Street should be a definite watch for anyone eighteen or over. The heavy use of drugs, nudity, sensitive scenes and profound language definitely warrants the eighteen plus rating that it is given. Though I stand by what I said about the storyline being terrible and the movie being 3 hours too long, I think its a terrible classic. Do not go with your parents or anyone actually. This is a film best enjoyed alone. That way you can freely think what you will about it, instead if being swayed by what other people might think about your thoughts on The Wolf Of Wall Street.",

This film could have been a masterpiece if the runtime was cut down. It would be a lot more emotionally impactful, and it would be a lot more effective in its storytelling. \n\nNonetheless, despite its slightly hit-or-miss writing and direction, the wonderful performances and its occasional cleverness makes it a fun and thought-provoking watch.

Regardless, the film has you mostly-entertained for a long 3 hours, which was initially shocking to see as the running time. One slash to this film has to be the tone and outlook on drugs for this film. Yes, Jordan has a clear drug problem, but it came across, at various times throughout the film, that doing these drugs has smaller consequences than they actually do. This is an issue. Even for a dramatized adaptation, these main characters should have been dead with the amount of \"drugs\" taken on screen. Ending on a good note, it was still fun, exciting and one-of-a-kind.

Similar to \"Goodfellas,\" the film's glorification of the very behavior it wishes to indict becomes its edgy appeal. This is largely because the film's protagonist Jordan Belefort never seems even slightly remorseful for making his riches through shady penny stocks and pump-and-dump schemes and spending these riches on drugs, prostitutes, and other debauchery. \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" is defined by the cinema of excess. With a script penned by Terrence Winter and a virtuoso performance from DiCaprio, Scorsese merely presents Belfort's psychology, without judgement, and is not keen on moralizing or politicizing. Though Belfort may learn nothing, the audience can. This may sound cynical, but it is honest. The result is a 3-hour adrenaline rush, an unceasing bacchanal.",

I love Leos acting in it, he just approaches these roles and embodies them so well, Margot Robbie's performance is very good too. It is a blood-pumping story and will keep you on the edge of your seat. They do a good job of showing a bad person as a compelling person and he shouldn't be. The one thing that I have a problem with is the energy of the movie, it goes all over the place. Overall I loved and would recommend it to most people with time on their hands, after all, it's 3 hours long.",

            "content": "The Wolf of Wall Street, directed by Martin Scorsese, is an example of an American success story set in the 1980's where young and eager Jordan Belford begins his journey rising through the ranks on Wall Street. The story demonstrates the lavish lifestyle of these individuals who act as a representation of American success. Money, power and drugs seem to be the driving influencers for Belford's extravagant lifestyle, and Scorsese beats this over the viewer's head relentlessly. He uses empathetic camerawork, throwing the audience directly into encountered as the result of his gluttonous drug use. Scorsese makes you connected to every one of Belford's experience, allowing the viewer to feel his every high and low as if they were right there with him. Overall this camerawork allows us to see and feel the way Belford felt, which ultimately lets us know how this commercially driven society impacts the choices and preferences of Belford. The people he becomes surround by enlighten him and further motivate his drive to indulge in the benefits of his success as a broker. However, these habits are what end up spiraling his life as he becomes to detach from others chasing nothing other than wealth and extravagance. People are interpreted as objects by Belford, only used to satisfy his desires. \nHe loses a sense of humanity throughout the film, and we are given glimpses of his transition into a selfish and power hungry nature comparable to the animal kingdom. I believe Scorsese chose to literally place wild animals within Belford's office to represent this concept. He did not want to force this idea down the audiences throat, but rather subtly alludes to the parallels to make the views think harder about why animals were necessary to be put in the film. Further the title of the movie starts with the name of a vicious and powerful beast, the wolf. I think the comparison is most associated with the power hungry nature of not only Belford, but his followers as well. Belford is obviously the top wolf and those who chose to follow are his pack. Belford demonstrates his power yet his employees or the rest of the pack is just an extension of his power. However, this relationship works as the employees are inspired by the presence and success of the head wolf, which drives them to chase his level of prominence and to one day lead his own wolf pack. The film demonstrates this endless cycle of opportunity seekers who aspire to be as, if not more successful than those above them, and frames this as a negative pattern intended to highlight the pitfalls of greed.",

            "content": "Party on Wall Street--\n\nThe Wolf of Wall Street is a 2013 film directed by Martin Scorsese set in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The film follows the protagonist Jordan Belfort, played spectacularly by Leonardo DiCaprio, on his quest to fulfill his dream of becoming filthy rich. Jordan starts his empire by founding his own stock brokerage firm, Stratton Oakmont. Jordan uses his gift of persuasion to sell penny stocks to wealthy investors. Jordan's own greed, selfishness, and drug addiction lead to his ultimate demise. \n\nThis story is a perfect example of the \"Success Story\" archetype. Jordan follows the American Dream and truly turns his rags into riches. Jordan arrives in New York hungry for success with a wife who is a hairdresser and almost no money to their names. He begins working at a large firm in a menial position on Wall Street and immediately becomes hooked. After finally becoming a licensed stock broker, Black Monday puts Jordan's firm out of business and leaves him without a job. Jordan eventually finds work selling penny stocks and builds his own empire. In just a few short years Jordan accumulates hundreds of millions of dollars. He owns a Ferrari, yacht, estate, helicopter, and more. Jordan even upgrades his wife to the beautiful \"Duchess of New York,\" Naomi. Jordan's rise to success is coupled with his own inner turmoil. As he grows wealthier, Jordan develops sex and drug addictions that spiral out of control. \n\nOne of the most compelling elements of this film is the protagonist, Jordan Belfort. Jordan is charismatic, witty, smart, compelling, callous, and crooked. This film incorporates both internal and external conflict. Jordan faces external review by both the SEC and FBI investigating his company and also struggles with sex and drug addictions. Jordan's character arch is interesting as he starts the film as a loser, develops into a winner, but is left as a loser at the end. His own greed causes him to lose sight of family, friendship, and morality.      \n\nThis film portrays the greed and corruption associated with Wall Street. I argue that The Wolf of Wall Street  is a critique of Wall Street. Unlike Oliver Stone's 1987 movie, Wall Street, greed is not glorified in this film. Stratton Oakmont defrauds wealthy investors of millions of dollars for their own profit. The firm avoids morality to chase profit at any cost. This film portrays Wall Street brokers as money hungry frat boys. The entire film feels like a mix of a frat party and business meeting. The film also has an underlying social commentary regarding workplace conduct, sexual misconduct, and abuse. The women are all highly sexualized in this film. The men are portrayed as sex-hungry animals. \n\nThe resolution of the film is Jordan's sentencing to 3 years in prison. Facing over 20 years in prison, Jordan cooperates with the FBI to give up dozens of his employees. This resolution shows that wealth and money get people out of almost anything. Despite getting out of the majority of his prison sentence, Jordan has still lost his empire, money, wife, and children. \n\nThis film is entertaining, funny, and exciting. Scorsese effectively warns against the dangers of greed and American capitalism while providing an interesting storyline and alluring protagonist.  I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars.",

            "content": "The Wolf of Wall Street - Rags to Riches\n\nThe Wolf of Wall Street is one of my all-time favorite movies. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a money-hungry young man from New York and his journey to take over Wall Street. The movie is hilarious, edgy, sad, and inspiring. It touches all areas of the emotional chart. Jordan's rags to riches story begin when he is a young man pursuing his dream of making a pile of money. His pursuit lands him on Wall Street, but that dream soon lands him on the rocks following Black Monday. He meets a man named Donnie, who becomes his business partner, and starts his own company. This is the start of the downfall of Jordan.\n\nHis rags to riches are somewhat fictional, as he decides to make his money with high-pressure sales tactics, pump and dump, and insider trading. The movie follows this journey from start to end.  Jordan had several opportunities to go legit and make money the ethical way but decides to chase the fast cash instead of doing right. His pomp and flashy ways are what lead him to the rocks soon after the release of Steve Madden's IPO. The decline is sharp and abrupt as drug addiction and unethical behavior wreck Jordan and every one involves lives. \n\nThe character development of Jordan is excellent, as he goes from an innocent stockbroker to a chaotic millionaire. He dissolves into a frantic lunatic as he tries his best to evade the FBI and SEC, but the journey of Leonardo's character is brilliant. Overall, the movie is fantastic and a must-see. The film is dramatic and funny, and the character development of Leonardo DiCaprio's character is brilliant as he lives out his rags to riches story. I think what makes rags to riches stories so enjoyable is that it seems like the everyday person could make it and the film does a good job showing the everyday person how not to do it.",

            "content": "The Wolf of Wall Street is the 5th collaboration between director Martin Scorsese and star Leonardo DiCaprio. The film is the blackest of comedies based on the memoir of the same name by Jordan Belfort, who is rapturously played by DiCaprio. It's a three-hour, full-throttle rush into the lurid and depraved world of the corrupt stockbrokers who plagued Wall Street. Structurally similar to Scorsese's superior Goodfellas, the film tells the rise and fall of Jordan Belfort and his corrupt firm Stratton Oakmont, helped along by enthusiastic, sometimes compelling narration from Belfort. In some instances, the camera drops to eye level, and Belfort turns and speaks to the camera, coaxing us like one of his own foul-mouthed primal employees, except I doubt anyone viewing this film has snorted cocaine from a woman's backside, which literally happens a minute into the film \u2013 repeat this scene for three hours and you have The Wolf of Wall Street.\n\nDiCaprio is outstanding in the lead role, selling every slimy word oozing from Belfort's silver-tongued mouth. His entire performance is dialled up to eleven from the start, and this ridiculous energy never lets up. It is a rapturous performance and you can see DiCaprio enjoyed every minute of it. Without his boundless energy and sheer force of will, the film would have been near unbearable.\n\nSupporting cast comes in the way of Jonah Hill as his best friend and business partner Donnie Azoff. Jonah Hill is superb once again here, both funny and charming, following on from his solid work in films like Moneyball. Margot Robbie is striking as Belfort's wife, Naomi. Kyle Chandler plays Detective Denham who is out to get Belfort, appearing intermittently throughout the film, and I would have liked to see him given more screen time because he is the film's only moral compass. You can see the frustration and weariness in his eyes as he tries desperately to bring down these corrupt wealthy giants who do nothing but flaunt their illegal empires.\n\nThere is a great little scene that sees Denham riding an unglamorous subway home after finally seeing his targets arrested and there's a fraction of pride and satisfaction in Chandler's eyes. Not sex, not drugs or foul-mouthed slap stick comedy, this tiny scene is my favourite scene in the film. Unfortunately, this is as subtle as the film gets, everything else is surface level, which is disappointing given the talent involved.",

Scorsese's direction is perfect as usual which is clear through the 3 hour runtime not being felt at all whilst watching and there is not a second I am bored. DiCaprio gives one of, if not his best performance which was definitely deserving of an Oscar and is just another reason why this film is incredible. A bold, veracious, entertaining and brilliant film. ",

This is by dint of the fact that it's a striking debaucherous exposition of what its like to exist in a drug and sex infested Camelot. Be prepared to take a breathe, because this film will inequivocaly take up all the oxygen in the room. They say that nothing is as important as you think it is while your thinking it, and these characters pay truth to this maxim as they attribute little import to anything in their streams of consciousness that doesn't rhyme with Qualudes. With great mettle and steely resolve, Scorsese dives headlong into a depraved hive that few directors would dare to go, and he does a colosal job doing so. It would stand you in good stead to watch this film, if your up for effervescent hijinks and crazy shenanigans. It's by no means an ethereal, diaphanous movie, so sport your hard kevlar outer coting while enjoying this one. If anything, the allegory of this film is that nobody is Teflon, and people should know when enough is enough and to capitulate before its too late. Even a broken clock is right twice a day, but people soon realize your broken and will take you down if you're not careful.",

Based on the real life travails of Jordan Belfont(Di Caprio) The wolf of wall street is made well but suffers from an excessive run time, and whilst I know that this was probably meant to be seen as dark comedy, the fact that not one character is likeable makes it sort of a chore to sit through. Leonardo is good although I only seem him playing a character. Jonah Hill steals the show in many scenes he is featured in and argot Robbie looks great, with and without clothes. In the end I am unsure if the great reviews are being given after looking at the marquee- would a similar film, made by someone other than Scorsese garner so much plaudits? I am not sure. Still, if you happen to be a fan of the director or the lead actor Wolf of wall street is a nice diversion, but not much more. ",

            "content": "We open the Wolf of Wall Street with Jordan Belfort, Leonardo DiCaprio, introducing us to the various excesses of his life, his well-paid job, his beautiful wife, his guarded mansion and a myriad of other luxuries that he owns. We then flashback as he explains to us, again through voiceover, his beginnings as an earnest young stockbroker. We then see him become corrupted by figures like Mark Hanna, Matthew McConaughey, and pretty soon he's working as the head of a giant boiler room brokerage firm and rolling in cocaine and beautiful women.\n\nIt is clear that Scorsese has great fun directing the scenes that portray how outrageously excessive this figure is and many shots: a midget being thrown onto a plush dart board, a dominatrix torturing DiCaprio and on and on, are extremely memorable. The question that I have to ask is, what's the point? Is Scorsese saying that this excess is bad whilst also reveling in and selling it, essentially exploitation. Is he trying to portray how easy it is to be seduced by this ridiculous lifestyle as the audience is sucked into the life of this detestable human being. The film's lack of message has been criticized and when it purports to have a message, greed is bad, the imagery of the film seemingly works to directly contradict that. I think that whether the film has a message or not it is a hugely enjoyable viewing experience, a Goodfellas (1990) for the 2010s, and the iconic images it has produced alone make it a modern classic.\n\nIf Leonardo DiCaprio deserved to have awards showered on him for one role it should have been this. This is a role where we see him go absolutely crazy, without or vanity or any sense of pretension. We see him drugged out on Quaaludes, driving a luxury yacht maniacally in the middle of a tropical storm and several scenes of him snorting cocaine off the breasts of women. He is insane, but DiCaprio finds the humanity in him. The Revenant (2015) is a great film but it is more about the filmmaker's intent than DiCaprio's performance, he is a simply a vehicle to portray the suffering that people living in that environment during that era would have to face to survive. Despite this, it was the Revenant that earned him the award and he was left with loss on the night of the 2014 Oscars for a film that is far more iconic and will be remembered as one of his defining roles.\n\nIt is not just DiCaprio's performance that makes the film a worthwhile viewing experience with Margot Robbie in her breakout performance, Jonah Hill as a nebbish accountant and Matthew McConauughey in a hilarious small role. Robbie does wonders with a role that is severely underwritten, with a character that is clearly intended to be a pure sex object Robbie not only looks ravishing but suggests that she is in on the joke, all of her cheesiest lines \"We're not gonna be friends\" are said with a wink and she hints at the cynicism behind her character's fa\u00c3\u00a7ade. Hill is on typically good form as the sidekick, as he was in Moneyball (2011), and complements DiCaprio well whilst McConaughey is perfectly disgusting as a smug, self-satisfied broker. Each actor does more with their outlandish character than you would expect and proves that each actor and actress possesses great talent.\nThe screenplay molds well to Scorsese's style with lots of voiceover, swearing and dark humor, often in unexpected places. Although Terence Winter, a television veteran with writing credits for The Sopranos and Boardwalk Empire, never reaches the heights of Goodfellas but does contain a lot of entertaining dialogue and some moments with real dramatic tension. Take for example the scene in which DiCaprio's first wife asks him if he loves Robbie's character, \"Do you love her?\" The screenwriter leaves enough open that the scene has room to be touching and sad, we care about his ex-wife and this is symbolic of him letting go of all morality, this would not have been achieved had he added extraneous dialogue.\n\nThis is a film that many young men enjoy in a similar way to how a previous generation enjoyed Scarface (1983), in that it is a film that purports to be against everything they like about it but this is certainly one of the easiest Scorsese films to watch and can be enjoyed by all. I would rank it as his seventh best film because I personally enjoyed the film despite it's lewdness and I understand this may be a drawback for younger audiences but I think for most it is a rollicking good time.",

Instead of helping you escape the stresses of real life, Martin Scorsese pulls you back in by relating this way too much to reality. The humor isn't the type of unreal humor most people expect to see in movies, no it's the type of humor your co-workers would make at the office. It's too relatable to reality, and is a basic expression of how a man hits the high life and then finds out some way to screw it up in all but hilarious ways.",

He also directs Taxi Driver. The film is a comedy and policial movie. It sets in the United States. More exactly in New York City at Wall Street.\n\nThe main actor of the film is Leonardo Dicaprio. He is very famous and talented actor. He receives an Oscar. One of the most famous films he acts in is Titanic, as Jack. In the film The Wolf of Wall Street, he plays the role of Jordan Belfort. He is a millionaire who makes crazy things with the money he gets off his stockbrokers company. Another actor who acts in The Wolf of Wall Street is Jonah Hill. He interpretes Donnie, the best friend and job partner of Jordan Belfort.\n\nJordan Belfort teamed up with his partner Donny and they founded Stratton-Oakmont, a brokerage firm. Their company grows fast and also their status in the business community. As their state grows, so does the amount of substances that they abuse. They attract attention like no other, throwing lavish parties for your staff when they reach so much money. That leads Jordan Belfort to appear on the cover of Forbes magazine, which is called \"The Wolf of Wall Street\". With the FBI watching him, he invents new ways to cover their tracks and grow their fortune. In conclusion, Jordan Belfort gives a plan to hide his money in a European bank. \n\nThe movie was based on real events. The movie is very good since it is well set in the 90\u00b4s. The soundtrack is very good.\n\nI give this film 5 stars out of 5. It's a really good and interesting movie. People should watch this film because it makes you laugh and have a good time. The movie doesn't really have a good message, but at least it entertains.\n\n\n\n\n.",

Besides, if you are a hard-working honest man who works to punish people for their crimes, you\u2019ll just end up riding on the crappy subway for the rest of your life.

One of them starred Robert DeNiro and Leonardo DiCaprio. And now The Wolf of Wall Street came out and they loved it and it's based on true events and based on the memoir of the same name by Jordan Belfort played by Leonardo DiCaprio himself. Like most Martin Scorsese films nowadays this one is intense. This is in fact the fifth time Leonardo DiCaprio worked with Martin Scorsese. They previously worked with each other in Gangs of New York, The Aviator, The Departed and Shutter Island. Everyone is going on and on about Leonardo DiCaprio getting an Oscar for his performance as Jordan Belfort but instead won an Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy as for some reason this is actually a black comedy but it has loads of biographical drama. Now let me get to something what is really important. Everybody loves The Wolf of Wall Street because your mum loves Leonardo DiCaprio and your dad loves to look at Margot Robbie. And you should't be watching it with your parents because why? Sex, drugs, nudity and up to 569 uses of the F-word. Martin Scorsese is known for making films that contains alot of swearing for the most part and if you're looking for a kid friendly film from Martin Scorsese, check out Hugo because everything else he's ever directed is never going to be child friendly. But if you regret watching a Martin Scorsese film with your Mum and Dad, The Wolf of Wall Street will be a prime example. That being said, The Wolf of Wall Street is a fantastic amazing film, lots of great acting by all cast especially from Leonardo DiCaprio. Although the film is 3 hrs long but that just makes the biographical moments look so epic and fantastic. The Wolf of Wall Street is one of the best films of 2013.",

Luckily, Leo righted the ship later in the year with The Wolf of Wall Street. It's arguably the best performance of his career and the film is must-see for that reason alone. DiCaprio is at his best when paired with Martin Scorsese (see Gangs of New York and The Departed) and that rings true again here.\n\nThe film is not without issues. At just under three hours, it runs long, especially in the second half. There are a few scenes that could've been cut out or at least cut short. A scene where Leo meets with his aunt by marriage while in Europe particularly overstays its welcome. Other than that, this fires on all cylinders. The writing, directing and acting are all great. Jonah Hill is actually a standout in that department, playing his character with just the right blend of loyalty and sliminess. Jordan Belfort is also portrayed in fascinating fashion. He's a layered character that leaves the viewer in between loving him and hating him. \n\nOne thing I didn't expect, was for this to be so damn funny. I knew it ventured into comedy at times, but parts of it had me in stitches. The scene where Belfort takes the drugs with the delayed reaction is hilarious. Watching DiCaprio drag himself into his car and then get into a fight with Hill had to be some of the finest work of either man's careers. Ridiculousness like that is perfectly intertwined with the tale of a man who seemingly had it all, yet was never satisfied and it led to his downfall.\n\nIt's hard not to be completely enthralled by this. Leonardo DiCaprio deserved his Oscar win for this and it's another hit for Scorsese. It's one of the best films in recent years, led by great direction, stellar performances and a witty script. The only issue is that it goes a bit long",

            "content": "SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Greg, looks like we have an encounter with the big, bad wolf. Hope he doesn t eat Little Red Riding Hood s grandmother.\n\nGREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) The Wolf of Wall Street is based on true events - it makes me pine for the 90s.\n\nSCOTT: The Wolf of Wall Street opens with young Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) starting a new job as a stockbroker at an established Wall Street firm. His boss Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey) asks him to lunch and tells him that the key to success is to encourage investors to make more and riskier investments. Hanna also tells Belfort that successful brokers drink, drug, and womanize to great excess. Black Monday causes Belfort to lose his job, but his aggressive salesmanship soon earns him a small fortune selling penny stocks.\n\nGREG: Belfort doesn t take long to realize that penny stocks are flying under the radar of the SEC and he starts his own company  Stratton Oakmont.  He hires his marijuana-selling buddies and soon they are making millions of dollars. That s when Forbes magazine interviews Belfort labeling him  The Wolf of Wall Street.  The article also attracts the attention of the FBI and Belfort begins his descent.\n\nSCOTT: Greg, this movie is all about bloated excess, and we see it in full force on two different levels. On one level there is, of course, the lavish excess shown by Belfort and his staff at Stratton Oakmont. They partake in prodigious bouts of drinking, drugging, and womanizing. The overindulgence of physical pleasure and the trappings of living a corrupt, greedy life are clearly on full display here. There is also bloated excess in the filming of this movie. Martin Scorsese needed to be reigned in here, big-time. There are far too many scenes of Belfort and Azoff (Jonah Hill) reveling in their inebriation, their toxic injections, their boorish behavior, their prostitutes, and their abuse of women in general. How many times do we need to see frenzied, infantile men snorting cocaine, popping quaaludes, and having random sex? The Wolf of Wall Street is basically Animal House on steroids, an endless orgy of excess in both the characters  actions and the filmmakers  ego-feeding editing choices.\n\nGREG: I agree with you to a point, Scott. The film clocks in at just 3 hours which was an hour more than the film needed. But Scorsese is a genius and nobody edits Scorsese. I thought it was necessary to show just how over-the-top these young men had gone. They believed they were above the law and above morality. But, yeah, a few of those scenes could easily have been cut. I thought this was sort of the opposite side of The Great Gatsby (also played by Leonardo Dicaprio). In Gatsby we have a leading man who worked hard to create a lavish lifestyle so that he d be worthy of the woman of his desire. He apparently has no other woman in his life. Belfort, on the other hand, creates wealth for the sake of having as much sex and drugs as he wants. His money isn t there to make him worthy of anything other than living as extreme a lifestyle as he possibly can.\n\nSCOTT: I just didn t understand the point of this movie, Greg. There are no heroes here, just a couple of jerks who get rich by cheating people. They are neither tragic heroes nor sympathetic figures. They re merely losers and villains whom we hope will get their comeuppance. Does the story teach us something about the downfall of humanity? I suppose it can serve as a cautionary tale, but like you said, lopping an hour off the three hour running time would have helped make this bloatation much more palatable. One positive observation I d like to make is that this movie features an extraordinary performance by Leonardo DiCaprio. This role showcases his impressive range as an actor, thanks to the volatility of the character he plays. I wouldnt have thought that DiCaprio was capable to handling the character of Belfort, who is a complex and broken man hell-bent on harming others to benefit himself. As much as I disliked this movie, I believe DiCaprio deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Actor.\n\nGREG: Scott, you re right when you say there are no heroes here, at least not in the classic sense. But I think Wolf is in the same category as other films we have reviewed this year - that of the anti-hero. We see this same pattern in American Hustle where none of the players has any moral character. We also saw this in Pain & Gain where main characters were hoodlums. I think we like to see the decadent side of life. In the case of American Hustle we see an FBI agent who is overcome by his desire to be a great agent. In Pain we see three men who want to take another man s wealth. And in Wolf we see Belfort who rises to the top and gains everything only to lose it to his greed. I think all three of these stories are cautionary tales and align pretty well with mythological stories that want to teach us a lesson: be successful, but keep your head.\n\nSCOTT: At least we see the lead character in American Hustle show compassion and attempt to make a change in his life. In The Wolf of Wall Street, the villainous lead characters are villainous to the bitter end.  I m afraid the wolves in this movie were just not worth watching, especially not for three hours. I do admire Scorsese s movie-making style, and DiCaprio delivers what is arguably the best performance of his career.  For those reasons I m willing to generously award Wolf 2 Reels out of 5. There is no hero story at all, no transformation, no positive mentoring, no sign of the classic hero journey.  Just a steady downward spiral for our villains. For that reason, I can only give this movie 1 Hero out of 5. Movie:  Hero: \n\nGREG: I agree that The Wolf of Wall Street is a masterfully created film. Martin Scorsese delivers and wrings the most from his actors. This is clearly the story of rise and fall of a giant. I did see an arc here. Bermont starts out innocent, is corrupted by an anti-mentor in the form of his boss (played by Matthew McConaughey). You and I have been talking about reviewing villains in 2014 and I think this is the origin story of a true villain. Our  hero  loses his caring and selflessness and becomes corrupt. Then we watch him fall from the highest of heights to the lowest of lows. It s a skillfully produced story and one I m willing to give it 3 Reels out of 5 (I would have gone to 4 if it had come in under 2 hours). I think we re going to have to give considerable thought to anti-hero stories in 2014. We ve seen a few this year and there is a clear pattern. Belfort, in my mind, qualifies as an anti-hero. He doesn t fit our usual expectations of heroes in the classic sense so it is difficult to give him a hero rating. But since he can be held up as a cautionary tale, I m going to give him 3 out of 5 Heroes. Movie:  Hero:",

Shot in a first person narrative, the movie portrays the hectic and erratic lifestyles of Wall Street Brokers. Filled with drugs, prostitutes and strippers, the movie implies that in order to work efficiently in Wall Street, one must have an indulgent lifestyle and have absolutely zero conscience when it comes to cheating or scamming people. The movie starts of by showing Jordan Belfort (Leonardo Di Caprio) as a newlywed man in his early twenties who comes to New York with dreams of becoming a Wall Street Broker. He is shown to be a very decent and naive man who with his young wife wants to make it big on the street and become a millionaire ultimately. The movie portrays that by showing him going to his first place of work at L.F Rothschild in a bus. This is very symbolic of the urban middle class in New York. This scene attempted to show that he came from a very humble beginning. Even his interactions with the people at his new work place show him to be very nervous, he is constantly stuttering and genuinely seems confused and many a times lost and doesn't seem to understand the instructions given to him. This changes when he meets Mark Hanna played by Matthew McConaughey, he teaches him how to be a good broker by telling him about his lifestyle and teaches him how to be more tough and unapologetic about taking money from people. He is the first person who introduces him into the world of drugs and strippers in order to be a sane broker. It is at this point at the movie we see a first glimpse of what will ultimately become \"THE JORDAN BELFORT\". As he becomes more and more confident and successful in his brokering skills, we see that he becomes more and more ruthless he starts to lose his naivety and decency. This can be scene in the scene where he loses his first job during the Wall Street crash and joins a Penny Stocks company, here he shamelessly uses the \"Pump and Dump\" strategy without any remorse or sadness, even though he knows he is selling his stocks at a very high price to his buyers. He knows what he is doing is illegal but chooses to do it anyway. Here we see that he is transformed into a man with no conscience and he is slowly becoming a mechanical money making machine. He then along with his flat mate Donnie Azoff(Played by Jonah Hill), open a Stockbroking company called Stratton Oakmont. Together they create an empire, this is shown by Jump Cuts showing the expansion of Stratton Oakmont and the increase in their employees. He does so by giving his employees a script to tell to their buyers, he tells them that they have to be very confident in the way they pitch stocks to their customers. He convinces them by successfully selling a stock to a random customer at a very high price and at the same time ridiculing the stupidity of the customer. The movie implies that stock brokers heavily mystify the actual workings of the system. It means that just the use of a confident tone in pitching can so easily sway a customer into buying a stock or not. The movie makes the stock market seem like a very simple job and subtly implies that people who invest in stocks are very greedy and their subconscious can be easily tweaked by the use of words to want more money. Even though the technical details about the market are hard to understand the movie does a good job of making its viewers understand that whatever Jordon is doing is illegal and that he earnt a lot of money by doing just that. They do so by showing his many magnificent parties, the drugs he used to take and consume and also his House. Even though initially a viewer might find his dishonest ways distasteful, viewers slowly grow into liking his lifestyle because of the brilliant way the movie portrays it. They show Donni and Jordan acting like mad, crazy and ratchet buffoons, triumphing in their glory and fortune. Jordon also goes as far as to bribe a federal agent who was onto his wrongdoings. The first person narrative given by Jordon throughout the film reiterates the fact that he is rich and has a lot of money and he leaves no ends turned to brag about it. \nIt is during this time that we also see a shift in his personality and at this point he is very arrogant and proud about his money and fortune. This is in stark contrast to the Jordon we saw in the earlier part of the film. The movie makes the audience realize how much Jordon has changed as a person since the time he moved to Wall street. He is actually completely different person. They do so by showing how he divorces his ex-wife and marries Naomi(played by Margot Robbie) who was a model. This attempted to show how he has detached completely from his old life. He is now a new man and is the Wolf of Wall Street as the title of the movie suggests. In the film Jordon sort of falls in love with his new lifestyle and is very insecure that this might be taken away from him. The audience can see as the film progresses Jordon becomes more and more cautious and nervous about how he handles his funds and money. From storing his money in his wife's aunts Swiss-bank account and becoming sober we slowly see him transitioning to his old self at the end of the film. This is fully realized when Jordon gets caught in a wiretapping allegation and is sent to 3 years of prison This is where we see him going back to the old Middle Class Jordon. Of course we do not see his wife but we see him becoming humbler. This was after his wealth was confiscated and he truly becomes the old Jordon in terms of wealth and personality. At the end of the film he makes money of teaching people sales techniques and we see this as a representation of a middle class American man with a mediocre job. The film showed a man who used to live a boring, mundane life which then transitioned into a one of a rich fast paced life which then ultimately culminated into him returning to his old life and self but also made him discover his talent which was excellent pitching skills.",

            "content": "The Wolf of Wall Street is a good film that was directed by the brilliant director Martin Scorcese who created a cinematic masterpiece. \n     The film is a movie adaptation of the autobiography of Jordan Belfort. Belfort is the owner of Stratford Oakmont who served three years in prison for defrauding investors for a massive securities scam and money laundering. Brody believes that \"Its furious cinematic inventions are no mere flourishes; they're essential to Scorsese's vision of Belfort's story, and to the disturbing moral ideas that he extracts from it.\" (Brody). The life of Jordan Belfort was such an interesting and adventurous journey from his life as a meat broker to President of Stratford Oakmont. The film showed Belfort's hungry for sex, power and money through different stages in his life even if Belfort was already a family man and moral values do not matter as long as Belfort was getting all the best things in life. \n     Leonardo DiCaprio gave the funniest, unhibited, great performance in this movie. The main character of the movie is Jordan Belfort played by Leonardo DiCaprio. This is the fifth collaboration of DiCaprio with Martin Scorsese. Brody acknowledges that, \"Leonardo DiCaprio, playing Belfort, he leaves impersonation behind and unleashes spontaneous bursts of energy that seem to tear through the screen\" (Brody). One of the incredible performances of DiCaprio in the movie was when he was so drugged out (cerebral palsy face) that the actor crawled to his white Ferrari car rolled down the stairs and used his foot to open the door. DiCaprio captivated his viewers whenever the actor gave invigorating speeches to his employees with such convincing power that the recipients of the speech picked up the phone right away and made that investment producing call. \n\tJonah Hill played the character of Donnie Azoff, Belfort's partner in business, pleasure and crime. Hill played the part extraordinary well as can be seen when Azoff got high on drugs and fought with Belfort's in the kitchen struggling for air. Mark Brody states that \"More or less the entire cast could fill the lists of nominees for supporting actors, especially Jonah Hill, as Donnie Azoff, Belfort's partner in business, pleasure, and crime.\" (Brody). Azoff's portrayal of a drug addict high on Quaaludes was close to the real thing as can be seen on his facial reactions and body movements.\n\tThe performance of Margot Robbie was astonishing where she played the sexy and beautiful second wife of Belfort. Brody states that \"her consonants alone, floating away at the end of words, deserve an Oscar.\" (Brody). Robbie was able to catch the attention of the viewers especially when she got into an argument with Belfort with regards to other women and their children. Viewers could see the strong emotions built up throughout the years of Belfort being a womanizer. \n\tMartin Scorsese directed the three-hour movie that is known for his movies like \"Color of Money\", \"Aviator\", \"The Departed\", \"Goodfellas\", \"Casino\" and \"Gangs of New York\". Brody believes that \"Scorsese's freewheeling direction captures the autobiographer's raunchy, discursive vigor. He also introduces a great device to impose the protagonist's point of view: Belfort narrates the action even while he's in the midst of living it, addressing the camera with monologues that show him to be both inside and outside the events, converging on-screen his present and former selves\" (Brody). Here, Scorsese was able to capture Belfort's point of view through narration while going through the motion. Scorsese was able to bring a good cast together in the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio, Jonah Hill of \"Money ball\", Margot Robbie of \"Pan Am\", Kyle Chandler of \"Argo\", Matthew McConaughey of \"Lincoln Lawyer\", Jean Dujardin of  \"The Artist\" and Rob Reiner of \"30 Rock\". Scorcese brought together a great ensemble who showed emotional and moving performances all throughout the movie.\n\tThe special effects used in the movie were so realistic and well done. There was a scene where the ship Naomi was sailing going to Monaco bracing the perfect storm with waves of 20 ft. high. And the viewers could see the realistic waves, storm raging through the ship breaking windows, flooding the ship and drifting helicopter. The aspect ratio, framing and camera focus was so carefully directed and shot by Scorsese with big attention details. The viewers could see how well Scorsese pan in and out of the character of Belfort's whenever he delivers a speech making sure Scorsese get all the reactions of the attendees as well as Belfort's reactions. With the film's budget of one hundred million, viewers could see the elaborate settings, expensive costumes and grandiose film locations in the U.S.A. as well as in Europe. \n\tThe musical scoring of the movie was a mixed of an orchestra and ninety's music. Jenkins claims that \"The movie barrels through time and space, boosted by punky songs whose titles say it all: \"One Step Beyond,\" \"Never Say Never,\" \"Uncontrollable Urge.\"(Jenkins). The choice of music was so applaudable, there was this scene in Belfort's house party where the employees were celebrating getting high on drugs and having sex then the music \"Insane in the brain\" was playing in the background. \nProponents of bad reviews of the film \"The wolf of wall street\" make a strong case when Jenkins argues \"Yet the zooming visuals don't propel the story to any place in particular. Sure, an FBI agent (Kyle Chandler) is nosing around, and Naomi eventually rebels against her husband's thing for other women, mostly hookers. But Belfort's character, such as it is, remains unchanged.\"(Jenkins) However this view overlooks how the overall story played together when Brody states \"Scorsese's freewheeling direction captures the autobiographer's raunchy, discursive vigor. Scorsese unleashes a furious, yet exquisitely controlled, kinetic energy, complete with a plunging and soaring camera, mercurial and conspicuous special effects, counterfactual scenes, subjective fantasies, and swirling choreography on a grand scale.\" (Brody). The author believes the character of Belfort developed throughout the transitions in his career from being a meat broker up to the time of being the President of Stratford Oakmont. Belfort was able to redeem himself in the end from being a drug user to a sober Sales motivational speaker. The visuals used were so important in each scene to depict the excessiveness of one's addiction to drugs, women and money so viewers could take something from it. There was one scene in the movie where they braced the perfect storm and Belfort's still used drugs while in the middle of all the chaos. When the Italian coast guard rescued them, the plane that was supposed to pick up Belfort's family blew up due to seagulls going inside the engine of the plane. Belfort thought that it was a sign from God. From there, Belfort changed his ways; Belfort got sober and became a sales motivational speaker. \nSome viewers may challenge the view that the plot of the movie was not entertaining and well thought of. After all, many believe that the film only showed \"various Cheech-and-Chong-style slapstick scenarios play out repeatedly, just with different props.\" (Jenkins). Indeed, this argument seems to ignore Scorsese's directorial masterpiece, which is supported by Brody when he states that \"Brilliantly, Scorsese doesn't hide the story behind the story-he makes the planning of a repellently decadent party even more absorbing than the event itself, and somehow manages to make a self-administered enema seem like part of the fun.\" (Brody). In the movie Director Scorsese showed the bad practices in the Stock Market, family drama between Belfort and his wife and children, camaraderie between fellow Stratford Oakmont employees and on top of this there were drugs, humor and sex involved so it is full of entertaining scenes and captivating shots. Viewers will never get bored watching the film. \nScorsese managed to extract astounding performances from his actors and in his latest collaboration with DiCaprio resulted in offensive, heinous and charming characters to ever appear on the big screen. As a movie, it is a must see.\n\n\n\n                                                                         Works Cited\n\nBrody, Richard. \"THE WILD, BRILLIANT \"WOLF OF WALL STREET\".\" Rev. of Movie. n.d.: n.   pag.

            "content": "Martin Scorsese is a master of the crime drama; time and time again he has woven detailed and thoroughly engaging criminal tales over the years that define standards in movie-making. He returns once again with ''The Wolf of Wall Street''; arguably his most light-hearted (yet still crazily entertaining) film to date.\n\nBased on the memoir of the same name; ''The Wolf of Wall Street'' follows the life and times of Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) a stockbroker on Wall Street who with his company Stratton Oakmont cheated both the economic system and his own clients to become rich and corrupt with wealth beyond his wildest dreams. All the while, Belfort must attend to the needs of family, friends, and a prying FBI agent named Patrick Denham out to bust him (Kyle Chandler). The film takes place across many countries and several decades that chronicle Belfort's rise and eventual fall in a similar way to Brian De Palma's ''Scarface''. Where Belfort's memoir contained a serious account of his brushes with the law, Scorsese's vision focuses on the opposite. ''The Wolf of Wall Street'' is insanely over-the-top in every conceivable way; whether it's the endless shouting, swearing, drug use and sex scenes or how Belfort's company is quite literally degenerated into a pack of rabid wolves, the film is a testament to how having all this money can corrupt beyond belief. The only problem with all this madness is that it can become very exhausting; a good half of the film is spent watching Belfort and company going completely crazy at parties and in the office. A more serious tone does arrive later but for those who appreciate a more controlled and focused crime drama experience, ''The Wolf of Wall Street'' will be rather jarring at first. Another niggling flaw is the theme of economics that persists through the film; unless you're a stout follower of the topic, most of the financial tones will go right over your head.\n\nThere may be a large cast present but in truth ''The Wolf of Wall Street'' is all about Jordan Belfort and Leonardo DiCaprio once again delivers a stellar performance all around. Belfort is a truly unforgettable character; his narrations of the plot draw you in and even though he spends most of the movie yelling through a microphone there's also moments where he can show some emotion; the scene where he goes ballistic at the prospect of divorce is particularly strong. Though they never hold the spotlight for too long, the side characters are also solid, especially Jonah Hill who completely nails the drug-addled Donnie Azoff, Belfort's right hand man. The other members of Stratton Oakmont stick to the basics; Jon Bernthal as a company courier, Jon Favreau as a security supervisor, and Rob Reiner as Belfort's father among others round off the cast and they play off the main leads well enough, making their presence known whilst never distracting from DiCaprio and Hill. These performances comes at a contrast with Kyle Chandler who is much more stable but often ruthless in his pursuit of Belfort and his cohorts. The writing as with many Scorsese films is sharp, witty and in this case possessed with a great sense of humour; in keeping with the film's over-the-top vibe the banter between characters and drug-infused shenanigans will often bring a chuckle from many a viewer. But the conversations also work to the film's detriment; there is a great deal of talking and arguing in the movie and sometimes the voices of the characters can drone on for a bit too long, unnecessarily lengthening the film when the next major plot-line could be brought in.\n\n''The Wolf of Wall Street'' may not be Scorsese's best film but with a brilliant performance from DiCaprio and an all-around crazy vibe, it's another entertaining and downright hilarious movie primed to entertain.",

It's like \"American Hustle\" because it takes two reputable actors (Hill and DiCaprio) and makes them very unlikable. It takes the run time from \"Casino\". And, the ending is basically copy-paste from \"Goodfellas\". There are some generally funny moments, but in the end, it boils down to a lot of sex, the F word, and drugs for 3 hours. And yes I get it, they're all criminals, but this is almost taking it too far. It's as if the film is just throwing F bombs, and boobs at the screen to see what gets a laugh out of you, and that is just juvenile from a director of this stature. I am glad I saw the film and gave it a try, but, that being said I found it very drawn out and would not consider watching it again. I love you Scorsese, I really really do, and I understand that every director is entitled to one \"dud film\". \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" is that dud for me.",

It was wonderful until  it had run out of control... human being is a weaker vessel and whose fault is it?..But as it well known big money can`t bear any weakness. Thanks to  the inexhaustible activity flavoured with great many drugs, Jordan Belfort was able to expose the hype to be  the best way  to get rich quick but later had become a victim of his own success  - the very boomerang  he was warned about. Keeping on drugs and continuing to feed his self seeking alter ego he even hadn`t a time to fix himself up   At the time, the U.S. legal system allowed gifted and  thriving businessmen to get  rich easily and fast bat its  one thing to get rich but another to stay rich bearing in view  that all the bubbles eventually are bound to burst. Today thanks to the rapid growth of the internet  we can observe a bubble market moving into oversupply and so far one can`t get  rich quick as it was before. Starting with different types of online casino where  payoffs depend  on generosity of its owners and ending with different  hypes - all those easy money-making activities cash in on endless human greed that is essential  touch of human nature. .....I am sure that Jordan Belfort would  be more successful  during the rapid Internet usage growth...like calls to like.. and  every  lamb has its own wolf....The fortune found to be mercyful and afforded him the opportunity to rethink values during the jail time.... As they speak - \"greed did him in\" but instead of \"greed\" there should be \"idleness\"...  whoever or whatever  he was jailed by, judging by appearance at least, Belfort  has easely been embracing the change....  \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" is One of the most dazzling and brilliant  real life stories ive seen...",

From nearly obnoxious characters to a vigorous dialogue, this movie really is one of the good ones. Martin Scorsese has created another absolutely outrageous, yet scary funny film. He has constructed an absolute savage movie yet somehow sticks to storyline and gives us a movie well worth watching.  The astonishing amount of drugs, alcohol, money, lovemaking and eagerness for power will keep your attention for the entire three hours. The music also plays a huge role in doing so; constantly making you cringe or tremble over the scene at hand. \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" is so wild and out of control, it honestly impossible to stop watching it.  With the length, sex, drugs, and profanity it is definitely not a movie to take your children to. I'm not sure I would even take my teens to it, but I am sure they would love to see it without parents joining them. \n\tAll members of the cast do a wonderful job in this movie, the stand out is obviously Leonardo DiCaprio, who pretty much owns and excels in any and all scenes he is in. This film really exposes him and all that he can do; he proves to be a likeable actor and a great leading man as he truly fits to be Jordan Belfort perfectly. This is my favorite movie he has ever been in even after watching \"The Revenant,\" \"Great Gatsby,\" \"Catch Me If You Can\" and so many other admirable ones he has been in. If it is your first time watching, I warn you to brace yourself. It will take you completely by surprise, but I honestly think nothing is out of place. If you do not like sex, drugs, and swearing, you probably should not watch this. Assuming you can watch it, it is a fantastic film, it has everything an exceptional movie needs. It is an adrenaline ride that never once loses its momentum.",

I didn't like the last Scorsese-Dicaprio teamup in \"Shutter Island\", I thought it was unnecessarily too long, but this one is just about perfect. It is funny, thought-provoking and at times even touching. \n\nDicaprio is just amazing in this movie, another of the long list of reminders why he is one of the very best actors of his generation. Jonah Hill and Margot Robbie also deserves special mention, they were a big part of why the movie worked so well. \n\nThe sex scenes were numerous and quite graphic, and while I enjoyed them very much it also meant that not everyone will get to watch the movie. At any rate, it is a great movie, one I won't hesitate watching again and again ...",

The acting and direction are everything you would expect, but the story based on Jordan Belfort's memoir is a complete downer. It is a long three-hour haul for a movie with a dislikable main character. Like Scorsese's Goodfellas, we have a flawed protagonist rising to power by exploiting others. He breaks laws and gets rich while living a reckless lifestyle of drugs and prostitutes. The second half is the inevitable destruction of a man who seemingly has it all. There are enough drugs, nudity, cheap sexuality, and greed to sink a barge. This may be the most explicit movie I have seen, but it has no appeal or sensuality. The overindulgence is only off-putting and shameful. The movie has a political mission to repulse the viewer with the excessive greed of a corporate monster whom many aspire to become. It attacks the Wall Street gluttony and makes it point rather effectively. The acting from DiCaprio, Jonah Hill and the rest of the cast is impressive. In that regard, it is an admirable well-made movie. I personally get no enjoyment or learn anything in watching this unfortunate tale.",

As he plays an alcoholic, billionaire playboy with a massive ego that is one of the most carefree people ever, you can't help but like him in this movie.

Do everything to the extreme because, well you can. Dicaprio is once again awesome. It is amazing to see how Dicaprio has grown as an actor. Going from the teenage heartthrob destined to be typecasts in roles like Titanic, to becoming one of the greatest actors certainly of my generation, and honestly of all time. The guy just knows how to pick roles. Sure he has had a few duds here and there, most actors do. But he just seems to be able to fit into almost any character out there.

The drug use is really excessive in this movie, but it is not like you were not prepared for it seeing that the opening monologue by Dicaprio is basically just him stating his love for all things narcotics. Cocaine, pills, and a little bit of crack are in this movie throughout the entire film. But my rating stays below three stars because I felt some scenes were just flat out silly. Whether they are part of the true story or not, they just didn't need to be in the film. I didn't need to see Hill's character with penis in hand masturbating in the middle of a crowded party. This movie actually plays out more like a comedy than anything else, until it gets a bit more serous towards the end when Jordan Belfort, played by Dicaprio simply tells the audience that being sober is boring and sucks.

            "content": "Martin Scorsese delivers a black comedy that fills its prolonged run time with comprehensive characters and an engaging story that can only be defined as insane. \n\n\"The Wolf of Wall Street\" follows the story of Jordan Belfort, who quickly goes from nothing to something by becoming a stock broker. We then get to watch as he takes on the daunting life of Wall Street, and quickly becomes known as the Wolf of Wall Street. \n\nLet me just start by saying that this movie can only be described by using the word insane. Everything here is just crazy, and all the characters on screen have pretty much lost their minds. It's just so entertaining to see this situation and this lifestyle play out on screen, especially when many considered this movie to be unacceptable. The reason why I think that the ratings are lower than they should be is because many people felt that this movie was glorifying all of the horrible things that these stockbrokers did, and even though there is truth behind that, I still felt that this movie was still one of the best films I've seen in a while. This movie completely embraces what it is, and it will be a crazy film for many to watch. \n\nThe reason why it took me forever to see this movie is because of the absurd long run time. It was hard to find a time in the day where I could sit down for three hours and devote all of my attention to one film, but I finally found the time. Let me tell you that it was definitely worth it, and this film didn't feel nearly as long as it's run time was. By the time the movie was over, it hadn't felt like three whole hours had past, which is really saying something. The movie manages to hold your attention during the long run time and keeps you entertained throughout. Not once did I feel like this movie was dragging on, and I actually think that the movie lasted for the perfect amount of time. I have to give this movie a lot of credit for being able to keep me focused for several hours, and I would definitely be open to re-watching this film, despite the lengthy run time. \n\nThis movie is just filled with energy, and you really feel that throughout. The chemistry between the characters is infectious, and you can really see the enthusiasm and energy that all of them have. The actors excitement really makes this movie fun too watch, despite the obviously immoral actions that is being justified by the writers and the director. I can say that I had a ton of fun with this movie, and it is an adrenaline rush at times.\n\nEven if you didn't like this movie, there's no denying that the acting in this movie was superb. Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the most outstanding actors in Hollywood today, and I think that he gave one of the best performances of 2013. He was maniacal yet charming in every way, and he brings so much life to a character that is so lively and animated. He manages to prove why he's one of the best actors to this day, and he was flawless. There were also plenty of notable performances from the supporting cast, as both Jonah Hill and Margot Robbie were spectacular. I actually really loved Margot Robbie, and her performance inspired me to watch more of her films. She has plenty of ingenuity and she makes her character feel so real. Jonah Hill also brings the comedy and spirit to his role, and really, everyone here did a great job.\n\nUltimately, this movie is a black comedy, which means it ends up justifying criminal actions and making it comical. The fact that this was based off of a true story causes this film to be treading on shallow water, and even though there isn't much repulsion shown in the tone of this movie, there are still plenty of moments to laugh about and enjoy.\n\nThis movie uses an absurd amount of sex and language to accompany its premise, and I thought that some of it was unnecessary. I actually don't really mind that stuff at this point because to me, it's just part of life and if you can handle it with maturity, then it shouldn't be a big deal. But the fact is, the overuse of this material can often make it a little bit awkward for its viewers, and this can be an uncomfortable movie to watch with others, especially if you watch it with your family. It felt like sex was used as a way to attract a slight portion of its audience, and it felt like they should've focused up on some of the more interesting aspects of the movie. \n\nIn the end, this movie was better than I thought it could've been. It was a dark comedy that gave an extremely engrossing premise, and it captured your attention for hours. Its lengthy run time was utilized to the max, and its character development was an investment worth taking. The acting was phenomenal, and I left this movie feeling satisfied, and even a tiny bit motivated. The reason why this movie won't get a perfect score is because I think that this movie relied on an overuse of unnecessary elements,  and it justified the immoral and illegal actions in this movie without showing much repercussions for said actions. But in the end, this movie certainly is worth watching, just not with your parents.",

When I look back on this film I couldn't cut this film down in length. For the story that they were telling every scene had a purpose, every scene needed to be in this film. \n\nThe characters and acting in this movie were amazing. There were times where I stopped looking at the actors as actors and actually saw them as their characters. This movie brought so many actors who have fallen into averageness back into the spotlight and let them shine.

There was some comedy here and there where the comedy felt forced and halted the enjoyment of the drama but this was extremely rare.\n\nIn the end The Wolf on Wall Street was an excellent movie that worked in so many unique themes and subjects that it honestly felt like a new and original movie that danced to its own beat. The Wolf on Wall Street is a must see classic that will only grow overtime.",

            "content": "The constant theme of Martin Scorsese's best work are the temptations of the flesh, never more aptly seen than though the prism of real-life subjects.  He's explored this through Jake LaMotta, Howard Hughes, Henry Hill and Jesus Christ, but in his new film The Wolf of Wall Street, Jordan Belfort may have the most savage appetite of them all.  Here, Scorsese turns his camera to the greed and avarice of the stock market boom of the late 80s that he sees in almost the same way as his great film Goodfellas, with a kid from the middle class who finds a short-route to riches and unapologetically enjoys the anything-goes lifestyle.  He wants anything and everything and gets it, no matter what.  Then, as Scorsese's subjects always do, must suffer for it.  Jordan races through life as fast as he can, acquiring anything and everything he can get his hands on.  Anything?  How about his own yacht with a helipad?  Of course, you'll need a helicopter to go along with it.\n\nLike Goodfellas, which followed the personal real-life story of an outsider into the world of New York gangsters, The Wolf of Wall Street follows the rise and fall of Jordan Belfort, who narrates his own story with the energy of a runaway bullet train.  At 22, he is a nice kid from the middle class who gets a job with a legendary Wall Street firm L.J. Rothchild under the tutelage of Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey) a wiry drug-addict who not only trains the kid, but lets him in on the secrets of quick success.  \"The name of the game,\" he tells Jordan,\" is moving the money from the client's pocket to your pocket.\"  This is a mantra that Jordan takes to heart, even if the client doesn't make a dime.\n\nThen, only weeks after getting the job, Rothchild hits a brick wall on October 19th, 1987 - Black Monday - forcing the grand old lady to close its doors after 90 years.  Without a job, he starts from the bottom at the only firm that will hire him - a meager penny-stock firm that works out of an auto parts garage.  Jordan makes himself a superstar by proving how easy it is to scam the client to make money fast.  He takes over the business, building it from penny stocks to Blue Chips to IPOs born on the backs of screwing their clients.  To his surprise, he finds a small patch of money hungry brokers ready to follow his lead.  Most visible is a pudgy Jewish kid named Donnie (Jonah Hill) who becomes his right arm. Donnie is a glutinous yin to Jordan's yang, an otherwise nice Jewish kid who tries to throw off that moniker by dressing as WASP-like as he can.\n\nIn no time Jordan has turned the tiny boiler room brokerage firm into Stratton Oakmont, an operation built on crooked investments from which flows money, money, money leading to mountains of drugs, rooms full of naked women, and every expensive toy under the sun.  He feels guilty about nothing, taking Gordon Gekko's mantra of \"Greed is Good\" and making it into a religious sacrament.  Jordan is a modern-day Caligula, a Roman Emperor who makes no apologies for his gross avarice, his drug addiction, his sex addiction or any other morally reprehensible machination that allowed him to get it.  In no time at all he has be biggest house, the biggest boat, the best sports car, the fastest plane, and mounds and mounds of drugs.  He even trades in his supportive wife (\"How I Met Your Mother\"'s Cristin Milioti) for a gorgeous blonde trophy wife (Naomi Robbie).\n\nIn our minds, possibly not to Jordan, there is always the dread that the party will come to an end.  We feel that, but Jordan constantly skirts disaster, especially late in the film when he desperately needs to get to Switzerland and takes his own boat instead of a plane.  The plane explodes in mid-air and Jordan comes to believe that he may be invincible.  We feel that too, even when a boy scout FBI agent (Kyle Chandler) start snooping around Jordan's books.  The scene at sea, incidentally, is a not-so-thinly veiled call-back to DiCaprio's role in Titanic when his boat is caught in a violent storm and it looks like The King of the World won't make it out of this one either.\n\nThe rhythm of the film is familiar to anyone who has seen Scorsese's films before, what is amazing is that it's always infectious.  We know that what Jordan and Donnie are doing is morally reprehensible, but there is something in the attractiveness of their behavior that makes us privately hope that they won't get caught.  In our own way we like these guys, and that may come from our familiarity with their other films.  DiCaprio, in particular, turns in his very best performance, throwing away his good-guy image as a man who lives by appetite alone.  There are notes here that DiCaprio has never been able to display.  Yes, he's good looking, but he isn't afraid to look like a jerk.  Here he is able to display his talent for slapstick in a scene in which Jordan ingests a 15 year-old Quaalude that sends his body into a fit very close to cerebral palsy.  That's no good when he desperately needs to get to his car to stop Donnie from making a fatal mistake.  What is surprising is that this scene is played for laughs and it works!\n\nThis is a movie made up of two or three dozen perfect moments like that.  Overall it's energy is charged by the pacing and by DiCaprio's in-your-face narration.  This is a raunchy, messy, but ultimately exciting film about one guy who desires everything and gets it.  If it seems a bit too long, that's only because it is playing to the theme of wretched excess.  The end of the film sends Jordan on a toboggan slide that seems somewhat inevitable, causing his reign as king of the world to end with a whimper instead of a bang.  Does he learn a lesson from all his sins of lust and greed?  What do you think?",

            "content": "Martin Scorsese gets an A+ in the department of directing his cast. He made Leonardo Le Crappio give me Scarface flashbacks. He made Jonah Hill look like prime Sylvester Stallone. The only actor who I'm convinced brought his own superb raw talent to the room and wouldn't have needed is Matthew McConaughey as Mark Hanna. Unfortunately, his role is so painfully brief. But I could've listened to him talk about business and drugs for my entire life and involuntarily orgasm and regular intervals he was so fucking good. Strange of me to compliment Mr. Shirtless in Space so highly.\nTerence Winter gets an A- in the dialogue gig. Which is especially impressive considering this is his only movie that matters for shits. I would think he would already be locked to do more movies based on this performance. Unfortunately, he does not get quite a high grade for storytelling. We're following a protagonist who is a slimy scumbag. Now, normally, I'd just immediately chop off your head right there. But you did a smart thing and show that Leo got into this at a relatively young age. So now there's a sense of sympathy for this guy amidst all his heinous acts. You've got two options from this point: You can either tell a redemption story or a fall from grace story. They went for the fall from grace option. Unfortunately, in order to tell a fall from grace story, they must...fall from grace. They need somewhere to fall from. And the first thing, second thing, and everything you show us, is him being a slimy, womanizing, drug-addicted criminal. So you got nothing. Every time he considers cleaning up his act, he gets right back to business as usual. The time he actually goes sober for two years has two major sins: First, it's not the resolution of the movie. Second: It's skipped over in under a minute. So instead of giving us the satisfaction of knowing he made it out and that we can get out, he just winds up going to prison, losing his kid....and the last thing you show us is him, ugh, doing the \"sell me this pen\" routine? Yeah, that, that's definitely satisfying. We just invested 3 hours in your movie so we could know that he taught people how to sell pens. Great lessons.\nAnd yes, Scorsese made the best out of these jabroonis, but casting director Ellen Lewis ought to be fired for deciding that Leonardo Le Crappio and Jonah Hill were good casting decisions for this movie. Have we not fallen far from the days of Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro. Minor complaint. She's done a lot of other great movies so who gives a shit.\nEditor Thelma Schoonmaker, who has done other classics, also puts on a firing-worthy performance. From moments of incoherency and decision making with absolutely zero logic - something you would expect would be extinct in something as professional and something with as much money in it as Hollywood - to moments of thematic incorrectness - moments where the story telling would be helped if sequences were re-arranged. Also, she allowed Martin Scorsese to pressure her into a three hour movie. Who in the world decided to make this a 3 hour movie? Who deserves to be fired? Is it the producer? Is it one of the other four producers? Is it the editor? Is it Scorsese? Just because it's a book doesn't mean it has to be this long. Just because Scarface had similar ideas doesn't mean this needs to be 3 hours. This story begs for 105 minutes, and could be told in 90. What we have are some 8-12 unneeded story events and dozens of repetitive scenes - how many times do I need to look at a room with a bunch of naked people mindlessly fucking and crack on the table before I get the point? Oh, speaking of hammering things into our head - a narrator? In 2013? Are you kidding me? And hey, it's one thing already when the narrator makes me want to send Martin Scorsese, the ultimate film professor, back to film school, because he's breaking the most basic film rule of all time: show don't tell...and it's an entirely different thing when Leonardo Le Crappio and his filthy mug are looking at me and explaining to me what an \"IPO\" is, when the audience could very well figure it out - especially when you're limiting your audience to very aged and experience consumers with material making this what should be an X-Rated movie if the MPAA had any testicles.\nA film with great raw attributes - dialogue, directing, acting, basic human relations - is bogged down into just a \"pretty good\" movie by its tremendous flaws - runtime, direction, casting, story, editing, repetition.

I dreaded its infamously excessive run time (close to 3 hours), but I was thankful to have never been bored at any point. Wolf Of Wall Street is a slickly made, well written, exuberantly acted piece of cinematic dynamite. I really can't think of a more fitting metaphor than that. It's a tale of greed, back-stabbing, debauchery and the ultimate consequences of a person's selfish actions. DiCaprio takes on arguably his most energetic and downright hilarious role, and instils a blood-hungry savage stock broker with charisma, bravado and, most surprisingly of all, likeability. In less capable hands our hero may have emerged as a hammy, one-dimensional jerk with no way to go but further and further over the top, but when he hits his low points you feel genuinely sorry for him. The first hour is a riotous and borderline hallucinatory journey into the life of a man with one mission: Make as much money as quickly as possible. From the beginning, with his meteoric rise to success, the celebrations, the friends, the relationships, it's clear it's all going to go badly wrong. Even when it's not throwing drug-fuelled parties at us, it manages never to become sluggish, but it runs far too long, and could have benefited from losing 30 minutes, largely with the shortening of some scenes which prattle on excessively. But ironically enough, excessive is the perfect word to describe the film. It has many stand-out scenes, a furious energy, particularly in the first half, boasts a central performance that was rightly acclaimed, and offers up a tonne of fun while also serving as a stark reminder that the higher the climb, the more painful the fall.",

The scam artist finally gets his. The chickens come home to roost, and the families who've been bilked out of their life savings get to glower down at their tormentor, now in chains, thanks to the intrepid detective, presented as a hero. \n\nNot this movie. The Wolf of Wall Street builds his little gang of fast-talkers, in whose hands a telephone is but an instrument to rob you blind. The con treats his tribe as family; they weep with gratitude as he big-heartedly helps them on their way towards Mercedes and Bentleys and homes in The Hamptons. There's no Godfather here. No one is dispatched to the bathtub to take their own life or pressured to join the fun by waking up to a horse's head. Everyone has fun here. And the detective who (sort of) brings him down is presented as a hardworking dupe, a sad-sack clock-puncher whose reward for his accomplishment is a daily subway ride amongst a sea of tired and lonely faces. In this movie, the con is stripped of a few of his toys, survives with his health and good humor intact, and moves abroad to once again build his little empire of crooks. Ever hear the Elton John song \"Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters.\"? It came to mind here: \"sons of bankers, sons of lawyers who turn around and say good morning to the night.\" Well, happily, movies this nihilistic nature weren't popular when Martin Scorsese was a young man choosing a trade. Why would a bright young man choose film-making, which requires study, patience, hard work and early failures, when you can trick honest people out of their money and get away with it?\n\nPerhaps one reason why this movie struck such a poor note with me is that I have many friends in former USSR states, states now run by cons, by grifters and crooks, and my young friends there have grown up in a world thinking that that's simply how things are done. I think that sucks.\n\nI know people love this movie. It's a wild ride, full of excess and fun hijinks. In reality, it's an open endorsement of criminality.",

Yet the list of comedies grows short with only the acidic The King of Comedy (1983) coming to mind. The current vogue among comedies are raunchy with a personal touch. The Wolf of Wall Street uses Scorsese's favorite actor of late Leonardo DiCaprio in a comedic setting. It shows the actor's and director's relationship has come full circle. From the early dramas like Gangs of New York (2002) or The Aviator (2004), to the trust it takes to makes a comedy. It is a risk for a legendary director to make a comedy since he will forever be known for his dramas. The Wolf of Wall Street fails if audience members view it as a cautionary tale of greed and lust. It works better if viewed as a satire or raunchy tall tale. While not Scorsese's best film, it does draw strong biographical parallels to Goodfellas (1990) in its storyline. Above all, The Wolf of Wall Street is a legacy film built by Scorsese to have fun and to flex his directorial muscles by doing comedy in the twilight of his career.",

            "content": "An excellent movie anchored superbly by the the performances of the leads (and the supporting cast!) and direction that is as utterly competent as you'd expect. \n\nProblem is I feel the story would occasionally get lost in itself. Not that it was hard to follow, the pacing was in fact on point, but it squeezes in many details that don't pay off and the length is padded more than it needs. Its a character study, a black comedy and a crime drama that avoids most cliches and it'd be impossible to call it derivative. Debauchery abounds, and this movie is definitely *not* about the hardworking 'good guy' FBI agents who end up taking down the corrupt and morally bankrupt main character. Their investigation is only portrayed as incidental to Jordan's shenanigans. But this isn't because Jordan is a PROtagonist, oh no. Its hard to like him but you probably will not hate him (although you would have cause to) since, unlike some movies in this vein, he pays dearly for all of his excesses, and it turns out he's not quite the mastermind he pretends. Where other movies would have the smooth-customer exec pulling double-crosses and cons to stay ahead of the cops, Jordan is a drugged-out salesman scrambling to hold his 'empire' together and failing at almost every turn, usually due to his own doings or those of his 'friends.' But you can't really feel pity for him either. All in all the character is fully realized and you do want to see his plight through for his sake, no matter how you feel about him.\n\nJordan also narrates his journey in the 'speak to the camera as I move through the scene' style and in voice-over. Normally I find this a bit of a lazy move, especially when its throughout the movie, but it gets played with here to some good effect. It still feels a bit like Scorcese is treating the audience as dumb, and maybe... just maybe that's the point. Jordan is after all a salesman and by letting him address the audience directly you can experience him trying to 'sell' himself and his story. Maybe he is trying to play us for suckers as he does everyone else. So it works but it still sticks out and hampers my overall opinion of the film. \n\nSo while it doesn't hit every single note right, the entire symphony works really well and DiCaprio is once again proving that the Academy Awards are a farce. The charisma this guy can bring to the screen",

            "content": "I don't see the appeal of this movie. It's not all that funny. Almost every \"joke\" it tries to make is a crass discussion about sex. It was obvious every time it was trying to make a joke because they had proper comedic timing and execution, but it didn't make me laugh. Even when I forced myself to smile in order to see if that made me more willing to laugh, I couldn't. I only genuinely found it funny when Donnie was having a conversation about marrying his cousin, and during a particularly outrageous drug trip.\n\nThe story got very repetitive at times. It repeated the same three things in many ways without really raising the stakes or switching things up at all. Jordan makes lots of money, has lots of sex, and does a lot of drugs. I got that; it would have been cool to show more about how this affected his personal life. When it came to the business aspect, I would have appreciated more detail about the inner workings of the stock market. Instead the movie just kept saying how rich the characters got. In the beginning, we get to see actual expansion of the company and a measurable change in the wealth of the characters, but this got boring very fast. Seeing the details of each scheme would have made things more interesting, but the main problem is that they get so rich at one point that any other money they earn doesn't seem to make a difference anymore. And this point comes fairly early on in the movie. This makes the 3-hour runtime feel unnecessary; I think a lot of scenes could have been cut and we would still have understood how insane Jordan's life was. The final act when his life starts to fall apart is easily the most compelling. \n\nI just like seeing Jordan Belfort as a character more than anything. He goes through a massive amount of growth and change in his attitude and behavior, and this is phenomenally portrayed by DiCaprio. All the actors did great, but this was an Oscar-worthy performance by him. He delivers each line with a sense of sincerity and makes it seem like every outrageous stunt Belfort pulls off is natural. Even when I got sick of hearing \"fuck\" and other vulgarity spewed every other second, I never got tired of watching Jordan.",

The story follows stock broker Jordan Belfort who starts out small but through many scams of penny stocks he makes it to the big leagues and makes millions of dollars. To start, the best parts about this movie are the actors, the story, and how fun this movie really is. Leonardo Dicaprio and Jonah Hill give really top notch performances, I feel that the performances they gave were their best. Margot Robbie was really good and for the short time Matthew McConaughy was on screen he did really good too. The setting of the movie was beautiful no matter where they were and it was just really pleasant to look at. The ambition that all these characters have is really inspiring but maybe not for the right reason because the characters are really slimy. The mishaps that Jordan encounters are pretty fun to watch main because of how funny they are, especially the part when he really overdoses on drugs with Donnie to the point where they can't move. I hate to say it but to see this guy fall from grace was pretty satisfying. He was just a really unlikable person the way he took money from other people for his own benefit and used it on drugs and hookers which I mean was fun to watch in a movie but thinking how this really happened is frustrating. The low points of this movie seemed to happen whenever he came in contact with the Feds because the movie seemed to slow down at parts where Kyle Chandler's character came on screen except for the first time he met with Jordan. Another problem I had is the editing of the movie was not the best. There were parts where a scene would just zip too quickly in the middle of a conversation and it was distracting. The Wolf of Wall Street had some awesome performances, a great story that stays true to material, a great cast, lots of funny and fun parts too enjoy. A-",

Martin Scorsese has really done it again. It really isn't fair when Scorsese and Leo team up together. Jonah Hill is incredible and is hilarious. We get the break out star Margot Robbie who is amazing. This movie is 3 hours long but you will not feel it. I have watched this movie at least 10 times and never feel the run time and would honestly watch another hour if possible. It is possibly the funniest movie I have ever seen while still being a drama. I cannot exaggerate how great this movie is. DiCaprio gives the best performance of his career and delivers some of the most quotable lines of the decade. Scorsese has an obsession with making movies about self-destructive men and Jordan Belfort is nothing if not self-destructive. He takes drugs a lot, he drinks a lot, he has sex with hot models a lot - Belfort lives everything in excess. Which is what this movie is about - the American dream gone haywire. I have never really seen a movie like this one before. It really does push the limits of what a movie can get away with and still retain an R rating, but that's what it makes it great. Besides DiCaprio, Jonah Hill and Margot Robbie also give great performances that compliment Belfort's excessive lifestyle.",

Also the story progression was good from starting from nothing to having it all, was the best part of the film in my opinion and the ending was satisfying. Finally all the acting in the movie was great especially Leonardo DiCaprio's performance from his turn of a good man who didn't do drugs to basically a massive arsehole but he made that look good. There are also a few small negatives; one of them is the over use of nudity in this film. I think in the film it was understandable why there was so much nudity, but it seemed that it was just too over the top and got ridiculous in some places. Another negative is, the story as a whole was slightly predictable and even before seeing it I had a rough guess of how the movie would progress; start at the bottom and work his way up the chain and become really rich, I thought this would be about half the film and the rest is everything falling apart and then somehow he cleans up his act.

Did Marty burn out after his Jake LaMotta bio, the same way Coppola did after Apocalypse Now? These were risky movies, driven by passion, bordering on madness. Did Marty and Francis lose their natural passion for making films because industry priorities dismissed 70's-style hyper-realism for sensational summer blockbusters and CGI spectacles? And why is Scorcese considered one of the greatest director when he really only made one truly superb movie?\n\nWhen I first saw Raging Bull in 1980 I immediately knew I was watching something that transcended the typical cinematic experience. Genius was shimmering out of every perforated frame flickering on the screen. Paul, Marty, Bobby, Mike and Thelma created something that was completely absorbing. The style and substance was perfectly fueled by a flawless emotional narrative. Every element was orchestrated just right. The audience was spellbound. We were watching greatness. A rare and unique organic creation. I'm still waiting for Robert Redford to correct a travesty of justice and hand his Ocscar over to it's rightful owner. And I'm still waiting for Scorcese to match his own brilliance. But that's like expecting Tarantino to top Pulp Fiction. There's a better chance Orson Welles rises up from the dead to one up Citizen Kane. \n\nAfter Raging Bull, Scorcese has made a string of pictures ranging from not bad to pretty good. All well-made, thoughtful and meticulously crafted films, but nothing special; certainly nothing profound. Contrary to popular opinion, Goodfellas is not a great movie. I was not swept away by the saga. I was annoyed rather by the fragmented non-stop soundtrack and incessant up-tempo style. Marty wasn't risking anything anymore. He seemed to be afraid of boring the audience. Perhaps he was trying to revive the 1940's never-let-up screwball-bouncing farcical Preston Sturges and co. comedies. But this is a mafia film. This should have been right up Marty's alley. It's been almost a quarter of a century since De Niro got his face busted in a boxing ring. Since the raw, robust and naive will-power of LaMotta's youth plunged into the pathetic, brutal, bone-headed stupidity of his later years. Similarly, Scorsese hasn't registered a knock-out punch since. Would his ensuing movies be considered great if someone else directed them? Would I have liked them all better if Raging Bull had never been made?\n\nThe Wolf of Wall Street is another exhausting affair. It tries too hard to excite and entertain us. It's afraid of slowing down, allowing us to ponder or examine the complexities of excessive greed, shameless wealth and unbridled capitalism. It desperately wants to arouse us. Like a neglected clown at a child's birthday trying to be loved and taken seriously while draining the life out of the party. Give Leo and Jonah an \"A\" for effort. They couldn't have tried harder if they broke out into song and dance every ten minutes. And they convincingly appeared to enjoy themselves freely indulging in coke, ludes and naked women every five minutes. It was nice of Leo to step back while Margot Robbie took her routine and obligatory, supporting-actress hissy fit. And you know a filmmaker has a lot of faith and confidence in his work when a superfluous narration track is added, to plug those terrifying noiseless gaps. Whatever happened to poignant, suspenseful, sure-footed, gripping, emotionally-arresting dramas that take you on a nervy, wild ride to a thoroughly gratifying climax? A truly great director from Kurosowa to, well, Scorcese-(circa 1979) would have plotted the rise and fall of a maniacal protagonist along deeper and more affecting lines even at the risk boring its audience for one minute.",

And understandably so, as this movie really takes its time to let you know that Jordan Belfort's life is just one big indulgence.\n\nWhat I love about the movie is pretty obvious to anyone who has seen it. First off, the acting is spectacular. Random characters with a mere five minutes of screen time feel like real people (AKA Matthew McConaughey's brief appearance). Scorsese goes out of his way to make sure that every character - major or minor - gives it their all. Personally, I have a soft spot for Jonah Hill, and enjoyed every moment he was on screen (the scene where his character and Jordan get high was probably my favorite scene; which is a bit self-contradictory if you continue reading). To go along with the characters would be the writing, of course. Terence Winter outdid himself with this adaptation. Though, it wouldn't be too much of a surprise if most of the actors improvised a lot of the dialogue on screen.\n\nWhat I did no like about the movie, however, would have to be the editing and overall story progression. It seems like Scorsese got real lazy with this one. Characters completely shifting positions between cuts and lack of ambient noise in many scenes gives the sense that the post production was incredibly rushed. Then there was the structure of the story. The events that actually progressed the story were found within the first thirty minutes, the two hour mark, and the end. Everything in-between feels very filler. It seemed like Scorsese really wanted to make it apparent that this guy was a real self-indulgent piece of shit, but this could be inferred withing the first five minutes. I'm not saying that these filler scenes were always boring or uninteresting. But I am saying that they were, for the most part, unnecessary. It also felt like the sub-plot involving the police investigation was just background noise compared to the onslaught of naked women and drugs.\n\nOverall, this was a great film that I would highly recommend. I cannot, however, see this movie being the most rewatchable film.",

            "content": "The Wolf of Wall Street is as savage a movie as Martin Scorsese has ever made. It's A Clockwork Orange and Caligula in the financial world, a movie about a man so caught up in ambition, greed, and addiction - to drugs, to money, to sex, to ego - that he doesn't even blink or notice as he ruins the lives of the people around him and drives himself into a massive downward spiral. He's gotten too high off the ride, and Scorsese sweeps us right along with him, letting us into this world not through a lens of judgment, but through the point of view of the man himself: stock broker Jordan Belfort, who got his start on Wall Street and made his massive fortune selling penny stocks and scamming the financial system, to blow more money than he could ever spend on a mansion, a yacht, hookers, drugs, and anything else his heart desired. We're entranced and horrified and wait in anticipation for a crash that, unfortunately, never comes to the extent that Jordan Belfort deserves. \"This is America!\" Belfort screams. The Wolf of Wall Street is the bastardization of the American dream. We watch with horrid fascination. \tThe movie is an indictment of corruption, but we spend the majority of it reveling right along with these white-collar criminals. On display here is, largely, extreme selfishness and self-gratification without consequence. Of the film, Scorsese has said, \"The devil comes with a smile.\"\n\nBelfort's descent from high ambition into total greed happens quickly. Wall Street is his training ground for ruthlessness. After being introduced to Belfort, we flash back to the days before his great success - to the day that arrived at a stock brokerage firm on Wall Street, and was told that he was lower than pond scum by his supervisor, someone making a few hundred thousand dollars a year. This amount of money is unfathomable to Belfort at the time. The movie's opening narration informs us that at the height of his success, he made $49 million dollars in a year - which really pissed him off because it was just $3 million shy of $1 million a week.\n\nOn his first day, suave broker Mark Hanna takes Belfort out to lunch. Belfort is eager to please him and to make a good impression. The restaurant takes up much of an entire floor and overlooks, through floor to ceiling windows, Manhattan's Financial District. Hanna openly snorts cocaine and orders a number of cocktails. He beats his chest and hums a marching beat. Nobody bats an eye. When Belfort seems hesitant to even drink a cocktail at lunch, Hanna laughs and tells the waiter that it's his first day on Wall Street. He'll come around.\n\nThe Belfort that Leonardo DiCaprio plays in this scene is characteristically consistent with his portrayal in the rest of the film, but here he is less certain and more genuinely eager to please. Note the glimmer in his eye as Hanna takes a liking to him. Note his hesitation and suppressed embarrassment as he glances around the restaurant before joining in with the marching beat, humming and beating his chest. In this one scene, Hanna, played by a smooth-talking and never hesitant Matthew McConaughey, infects Belfort with the ruthless selfishness that will be the ruin of everyone he comes into contact with (and himself). Hanna tells Belfort that his only obligation is to put meat on the table for his wife. The name of the game is moving money from your clients' pockets into your pockets. That it isn't advantageous to make the clients money at the same time, but to play off of their greed and addiction and keep re-investing their money into different stocks, making cold hard cash on commissions while they are only getting rich on paper. It is all a game where the only rule for the stockbroker is to keep pocketing money and never hang up the phone until a deal is struck that is in the broker's advantage.\n\nBelfort tells the subsequent story of his rise to success and wealth with sardonic glee, mostly through voiceover narration, sometimes as a direct address to the camera. As SEC officials are checking out his firm's documents while illegal trading is happening out on his company's floor, the camera tracks Belfort through the cubicles as he rambles off jargon about IPOs - and then smirks egotistically, saying that we're probably not following him, but the point is, \"Was any of this legal?\" His smirk grows. \"Absolutely not.\" He walks away. In an earlier direct address, he sips a drink out of a tall, expensive glass and tosses it and half of his drink casually into the bushes when he gets outside, without a second thought.\n\nBelfort seduces us through his narration and with his excessive lifestyle of instant gratification. We see his world through his eyes, and barrel through overstimulation and debauchery without consequence for the majority of the film. We almost never see the effects of Belfort's actions, because we see everything through his point of view. There is a scene near the end of the film in which Belfort recounts a drive home from a country club one mile away from his mansion. High to the point of incomprehension and loss of motor skills on Quaaludes, Belfort speeds back home in his luxury sports car. He recounts his drive home as if he didn't get a scratch on either himself or the vehicle.\n\nThe high of drugs have made him blind to reality. The next morning, he wakes up to police officers who show him the full extent of the damage caused by his nighttime drive. \n\nBut just because we see mostly just the intoxicating rush of excess and the wealth that Belfort amasses around him does not mean that we do not get a glimpse, if we step back, into the horrifying selfishness and inhumanity of his actions. A friend commits suicide, and he sardonically mentions it in narration and follows it with a quick \"anyway\" before moving on. His first wife catches him snorting cocaine off of his mistress' breasts inside of a limo, and Scorsese holds on a wide shot from across the street as they stand, distressed and apart, in front of the luxury hotel building. \"I felt terrible,\" Belfort says in his narration. The film then cuts to the inside of his apartment, and the narration continues to say that he asked his mistress to move in with him three days later, and she agreed. He and his fellow board members discuss inviting little people over to the office, so that they can throw them at targets as darts and bowl with them for fun. They refer to the little people as \"its\" instead of people to avoid liability. He loses all concept of the value of money, and it's terrifying to watch him arrogantly throw hundred dollar bills and whole lobsters off of his yacht after FBI agents as if they were scum and the money was nothing.\n\nBelfort does nothing for anyone but himself, and becomes so addicted to money, sex, and drugs that he pursues nothing else. The Wolf of Wall Street speeds through his mistakes and risks and faults with such blinders on that we don't even realize that we're watching a horrible downward spiral until Belfort hits the bottom. It comes as a surprise to him, as well.\n\nThat Belfort brought himself up from nothing and reinvented himself so boldly after the stock market crash is impressive, but his story is a perversion of the \"American dream.\" Still, we watch with fascination. He becomes a master of smooth-talking clients, smirking and laughing to himself at his own manipulation. Cheating people becomes an amusing game. And he rampages his ego in loud, boisterous speeches to his team in the office. He's training a whole herd of people to be just as selfish and amoral in their pursuit of wealth as he is. We are captivated.\n\nAs this all comes back to bite him - the bad behavior, the corruption, the illegal trades, the selfishness - the film descends into a haunting sequence of scenes, much to the credit of DiCaprio and actress Margot Robbie, who plays his blonde bombshell second wife, Naomi. A break-up sex scene between them in their bedroom is emotionally brutal. To end a film that presented almost nothing but frivolous sex, their final intimate scene is excruciating, and the look on her face is so completely vacant and spiteful. To end a film that presented up until nearly the end drugs as nothing but a fun, enjoyable high, Scorsese pulls back and we watch as Belfort pathetically rips open his couch to get at his secret stash of cocaine, which he snorts, unable to handle his emotions. For the majority of the film, we linger close by Belfort, engaging in his life. When he gets abusive and violent, Scorsese holds back. We watch from afar. The sequence ends with a car crash and one tiny tear of blood dripping down Belfort's cheek. He did this all to himself.\n\nThe Wolf of Wall Street is a wild ride of debauchery and excess that gives us a glimpse into the world and mindset of those who financially ruined the lives of many Americans. And though it is obscene and terrifying, it is a hypnotic ride indeed. The acting throughout the film is all first-rate. Leonardo DiCaprio has never been more ferocious. Jonah Hill has never been more despicable. Matthew McConaughey, in his minor role, makes a huge impact that changes the course of Belfort's life. And Margot Robbie gives an especially powerful performance, particularly in the final scenes mentioned above.\n\nIf the ferocious, direct, fast-paced, subjective storytelling of The Wolf of Wall Street doesn't feel particularly fresh or new, it's only because Scorsese has done this before (notably in Goodfellas and Casino) - but The Wolf of Wall Street proves that he's still the best at it. Scorsese and his team brilliantly show us the allure and madness of this world from the point of view of those living blindly within it. If you need the movie to tell you that these are bad people, that's not the movie's problem.",

It's my least favourite Scorses movie and i'm not sure if I'd give it another watch.\nThe screenplay is so overwritten with swear words that no other movie has had at such an unequal extent and unequal running time, and it makes the diaolgue sound so bizarre and absurd that it leads things astray in a ridiculously foolish way. \nAlso i've never seen a movie with so much screen time of overrated nudity, and it's understandable the content depicted is for the purpose of this movie being based of a true story, but the direction, writing and acting is confiscate with it's unequal and unnecessary lengths. \nLeonardo Dicaprio's acting was good part of the way, but bits of it weren't as great as it is in a lot of his movies. Jonah Hill's acting was fine also; it was actually far better than it is in some of his comedies, and something new for him. Margot Robbie is the beauty queen of the movie; the audience would have favoured more screen time for her as her presence in the movie delivered a bit of excellence compared to some of the other performances.

            "content": "The setting of the movie starts off close to Black Monday, the day in which the stock market crashed and confiscated the jobs of many people, including the job of a character named Jordan. Jordan Belfort, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is the perfect exemplification of innocence turned malicious with the influence of reality. After losing his job with the stock market crash, Jordan learns that in order to survive and live the lavish life he's always dreamed of, he's got to become a wolf, a thirsty beast in constant hunt for prey (which here is the money). With a brand new mind set to succeed no matter what, Jordan works his way up from selling penny stocks under a shabby company to creating his own company, Stratton. With the help of many friends and associates such as the character named Donnie, his right hand man, Jordan takes a company that started in an empty storage-like room to a multimillion dollar corporation. With success, money, and a change of mindset to a hungry wolf, Jordan is introduced to all the perks money comes with in society. His life is centered on the malicious and lustful things of the world such as drugs, women, and sex. His daily routines changed from working hard every day to rather smoking a line of cocaine daily, having sexual relations with hookers, lying, and influencing others to live this so called lavish life he lives. With money came massive power, a status in which seemed to allow Jordan to do whatever he practically wanted to. But sooner than expected, Jordan finds himself as a target amongst the police as they begin to invest in the illegal activities he had been involved with such as money laundering and keeping hidden accounts with a Swiss banker. I guess you can say that he received consequences for his actions, as he loses his Duchess wife Naomi and their child, his position as the CEO of Stratton, his partners, and his business deal with the infamous shoe company Steve Madden, and is sentenced to a few years in prison. But, it was neither the introduction nor the climax of the story line that interested me the most; it was the ending that struck me the true reality of the movie. Even though to the public's eye Jordan seemed to have lost everything he could, in reality he's still smiling at the end of the day as he maintained the two most precious things in his life, money and power. Because with money and power, Jordan proves to us that reality is not the reality everyone seems to have witnessed as the movie ends with him in a different high class level prison, allowing him to play tennis in luxurious joggers. So with that being the ending, the honest catch I got out from this movie was that society is cruel, but because it is also shallow, those with money and power can still win the heart of society and reality.",

            "content": "\"RICH & RAUNCHY\"\n\n2013 saw its fair share of raunchy comedies like This Is The End and We're The Millers but they have nothing on Martin Scorsese's audacious The Wolf Of Wall Street.  Jud Apatow bow down to your new king of foul language, sex, drugs, and all around insanity.  The mere fact that Scorsese made this movie and was able to get an R rating is a miracle.  The Wolf Of Wall Street is the years most shocking and sexually graphic film, definitely leave mother at home and don't even dream of taking the kids to this one.  You'll know why after only the first five minutes when Leo DiCaprio finds a creative place to blow cocaine into.  Yeah... he has a straw and he sticks it... oh just go see it.  You'll never look at him the same ever again, or many of the rest of the cast for that matter. \n\nThe story is based on the true life of Jordon Belfort who in the 1990's pulled off a huge scheme convincing investors to dump millions into garbage stocks making him and his employees rich beyond belief.  They threw huge parties, did copious amounts of drugs, had wild office group sex, did morally unspeakable things, and had no problem spending what was left on exuberant luxuries from sports cars to yachts.  The FBI eventually found them out but times were good leading up to the inevitable end.\n\nJonah Hill again proves that he's one of the finest men acting in Hollywood right now and can truly embody the characters he portrays.  I do believe he deserved the Osacar for Moneyball and he at least deserves recognition for what he did in this movie.  The kid has skills.  Leo also hits it out of the park, but I'll admit he's done better in the past and don't see him getting a ton of attention for this even though he really should.  The cast is huge so I won't get into everyone's involvement but I will say there wasn't a single one of them that I was disappointed in and all of them had some rather shocking and revealing scenes (fake or not) that left me wide-eyed and picking my jaw up off the floor. \n\nAt times you may feel like the sex and drugs gets to be too much, like we get it already, but the point of it all is you really can't fathom just how crazy it really was.  Don't get overwhelmed by it all, instead soak it up and just try to imagine doing all the things they did without imploding.  I don't know how they survived, honestly.  It's impossible to calculate how much cocaine they did, how much money they spent, and how many women these men got with and frankly I think if we did have a number you wouldn't believe it anyway. \n\nScorsese's recent films Hugo and especially Shutter Island didn't do much for me, but I'm back on board the Scorsese train now.  He's clearly in top form here.  Not only was the directing phenomenal but also the cinematography with its wide sweeping shots, richly lit sets, and high-energy camera movement.  The movie is a spectacle to be seen and a rare visual treat for a film of its kind.  Top all that off with a fantastic script, gorgeous production design, fine tuned editing, and a stellar sound track and The Wolf of Wall Street earns a top spot on the list of the years best films. \n\nFINAL SCORE = 5/5 Bear Paws\n\nWest Fisher\n\nMovieBears.com, Las Vegas\n\nNevada Film Critics Society\n\nThe International Academy of Film & Television\n\nwest@moviebears.com",

He was made out to be a cameo in the trailers, but actually ended up co-staring with Leonardo DiCaprio.  Matthew McConaughey was only a cameo.  Highly recommended for fans of Martin Scorsese.

What Scorsese did for Goodfellas he accomplishes with The Wolf of Wall Street and for me marks a career return to form after films like Hugo, Shutter Island and Bringing Out The  Dead. Wolf is hard hitting, belligerent, rude, offensive and comedically filthy, all of which are par for the course in a Scorsese flick. Wolf for me was likened to a smart mans Scarface as you witness Jordan Belforts rise and fall from financial juggernaut to a mere criminal. Highly Recommended.",

Well, what do you get when you cross director Martin Scorsese, Leonardo DiCaprio, and a bunch of Playboy bunnies?  Why, of course you get an incoherent, three-hour glorification of debauchery, drugs, and greed.  Truly, the only things which rolled the plot along (and the term \"plot\" is used loosely here) are the relentless strings of orgies and f-bombs.  \n\nJordan Belfort (DiCaprio) starts off as a Wall Street intern in 1987, right before the huge market crash.  He loses his job, ends up selling penny stock out of a garage, and eventually works his way up to penthouse apartments, mansions, beach houses, and 100-foot yachts.  Through his company, Stratton Oakmont, he makes a series of unscrupulous, downright illegal investments until he comes under the FBI's radar.  Rather than behave with more discretion, Belfort simply smuggles millions of dollars to Switzerland and amps up his hedonistic lifestyle.  When he wrecks his yacht off the coast of Italy, he is \"scared straight\" and decides to clean up his lifestyle, but it is already too late.  He has thumbed his nose at Uncle Sam too many times and gets ratted out by his Swiss banker.  His wife takes their children and leaves and, after he agrees to implicate most of his Stratton Oakmont partners, he is sentenced to four years.  When he is finally released, he ends up teaching sales seminars to wannabe marketing millionaires.  So much for \"plot.\"\n\nPerhaps the most entertaining part was when Belfort so got twisted on quaaludes that he could only ooze out of his country club to drive home and get into an inebriated brawl with his best friend, Donnie (Jonah Hill).  Moreover, the only character with any real depth is Jordan Belfort's father, Max (Rob Reiner). \n\nTruly mind-boggling is how this insufferable turd evaded an X-rating.  Michael J. Fox handled the subject with more wit and class in \"The Secret of My Success.\"  The \"Wolf of Wall Street's\" one redeemable quality:  it reminds us why we stopped watching dramas and switched to cartoons, monster movies, and Sci-Fi.",

I even felt a bit emotional, because some of the events in the film truly illustrate how life can be; it can be fun but also terrible. Leonardo DiCaprio as Jordan Belfort is flawless, and the main cast are incredible. This in combination with a great story results in a fantastic and realistic film, but it got some downsides. One thing is that the second part of the film is less funny, and the tempo is also a bit slower. The movie overall could have had even more entertaining things, it could have resulted in a higher grade from my perspective! The last thing is the ending, there's nothing wrong about it but it could have been more exiting or thrilling maybe.\n\nThe Wolf of Wall Street is a fucking wild film, and I really recommend everyone to see it!\n\nThe Wolf of Wall Street gets a 7.5/10",

            "content": "I love the boldness and brashness, the glorification sucking you in further and far more temptingly than GoodFellas, the big mind trick that this box of movie magic provides.  It's proof that Scorsese is at the top of his game, on a continuous journey of topping himself each time he does this.  The Wolf is an absolutely perfect example of a movie that is totally conscious of its viewer juxtaposed to projection - he is offering an opportunity for the victims to understand what they're victim to, and they can be part of the profiteering if they'd like.  You're both empathetic of the drive but hurt by the consequences.  It speaks to the heart of a modern world that feels threatened by Wall Street.  They are facing us, perpetrators vs victims, and we're left with our thumbs hanging, trying to decide how to feel about all of it.  Maybe it just is and we give up on judging it, or maybe serious policy is made as a result, but either way the audience is on a trip.  This is Leo's best work; should've been the Oscar grabber.\r\n\r\nIt's a challenging film to watch because it requires the audience to responsibly play along - the audience has a role to play, not an easy thing for the common viewer to take on.  We know we are indulging in wicked things, but we shouldn't try to contain ourselves or hold in our laughter.  We should allow ourselves to be these people, like we do in GoodFellas.  This appeals more to our desires than GoodFellas does; it's easier to get behind a man who wants all this power and isn't killing anyone to have it.  It's easier to get behind an orgy of naked bodies than it is a mass of murdered corpses.  We all want to be Jordan Belfort.\r\n\r\nDiCaprio and company are all in key, firing on all cylinders, adrenaline fueled in high octane performances that get the most out of each player.  Belfort screams on the microphone at the beach house party or in the office, he's all out there.  The Quaalude scene is magnificent, capturing sparkles of spilling alcohol, a swarm of pills tantalizingly spilling across the pool table as Belfort explains the appeal of this drug, Jonah Hill's Donnie spilling into his friends in extremely slow motion... then suddenly we're looking at a Steve Madden commercial, girls with big heads (not in vain, this will come back).   At this point we meet Margot Robbie's Naomi, the Duchess of Bay Ridge - \"I would let that girl give me fucking aids.\"  Jordan is all over it, not caring about the boyfriend she showed up with, or that he too is married.  She's the keeper, anyone will do anything for her, and he's going all out for her.  He's already got it all, what's not to want?  Donnie, higher than fuck itself, has noticed how hot she is from above, coming downstairs to masturbate in front of the party, much to his wife's (cousin) distaste.  \r\n\r\nI love the relationships, how Donnie finds Jordan, Jordan and his father Max (Rob Reiner), Donnie and the tough guy who lives with his mom Brad, a pair so distasteful of each other that it becomes the first serious crack in the operation legally.  Donnie starts off an impressively aggressive guy for someone living in the lower depths, upfront asking Jordan to hook him up with his lifestyle.  Jordan takes to him, and the two are like inseparable brothers the rest of the way.  Max is an oddball, having conversations with his son about bush vs shaved (he likes the bush), screaming at the telephone before picking it up in an almost English accent.  Reiner brings terrific charisma to the screen that instantaneously spells out the character without him having to earn it.  The diversity of personalities just has me smiling - Chester, Rugrat, Sea Otter, Toby.  These guys are fun, we wish we were part of the gang - Terence Winter is wise to include nicknames.  Look at the way Rugrat smiles when he learns a potential sale recently lost a loved one - these guys are shameless.\r\n \r\nTo this day I am mystified by the fact that somehow three hours goes by.  I've sat through 90 minute films which feel longer.  That tells us something about how relentlessly high the energy is from first frame to last, a terrific compliment to what may be Thelma Schoonmaker's crowning achievement.  Scorsese provides a lot of intriguing, not at all basic coverage - what must it look like for her to receive all that film?  And how does she contain it all with the sensibility that she does to tell the story as it is?  It's one of those things that seems impossible, requiring artists all working synchronistically on a frequency generating moment to moment creative genius at the highest level.  Scorsese is aware of the momentum at every beat, his camera shows it, Rodrigo Pietro spectacularly gliding across the office with the odd choice of song, \"Hey Leroy, Your Mama's Calling You\" from Jimmy Castor.  Right before this, \"I want you to deal with your problems by becoming rich,\" he declares in an inspiring monologue after Steve Madden fails to gain their interest.  \"You be telephone fucking terrorists!\"\r\n\r\nThe antics are another eye opener - tossing midgets at a bullseye, naked parade, orgies on a plane, or in the office, or in his penthouse, shaving a woman's head for money, firing an employee for washing his fish bowl and eating his goldfish.  We enjoy the fun and feel Kyle Chandler's FBI are being dicks, but at the same time we can't help but feel justified in wanting to see him nail Belfort's operation.  At the end of the day, Belfort is really giving us the finger, as directly stated in a shot when he's screwing over a family man on the phone, who's cleverly framed as the audience itself.  Jordan's new co-workers stand around him in awe of how he screws people into buying stocks that will fail on them, directly facing us as the phone is in the immediate foreground, playing the role of us; we are on that phone.  Jordan treats the conversation like he's fucking someone from behind, his sale being the orgasm, celebrating with a middle-finger hang up.  This ultimate blue-chip Kodak sale is intercut with a training montage as a room of 'senior vice-presidents' learn their phone script and how to equally screw buyers.  The office grows from a garage to Wall Street in a matter of a few cuts.  \r\n\r\nTerence Winter is all over this, and one of the most deceptively brilliant scenes is between Agent Denham and Belfort on his yacht.  Belfort refused to listen to his private investigator not to fuck with Denham, but his young cocky ego couldn't let the idea go that he was the powerful one here, and so he invites him to his yacht to see if he can maneuver him.  Denham plays into his hand, masterfully performed by Chandler, manipulating Belfort to believe that perhaps he has regrets about his career choice, maybe would've preferred going into stock brokerage like Belfort.  It's at this point Belfort gets into some nonsense about how he wants to help people like Denham out, which Denham reads as a bribe.  He takes this in for a moment, wanting to be careful, nodding to his cohort.  But he plays it too obvious when he asks Jordan to repeat himself, the moment passed.  However, their rivalry is established, they know each other now, hero and villain, and it's only a matter of time before they meet again in less pleasant circumstances.\r\n\r\nBelfort's reaction to the Lemmons requires all the tools in an actors kit, as far as what Eddie Redmayne had to pull out for Stephen Hawking's ALS.  It's just about two hours into the film and we get the feeling that something is about to happen, a noticeable absence of music as Jordan drives to a payphone to talk to his P.I.  Now Belfort's bribe to Denham is coming back to haunt him, he's finding out that the agent is all over him with bugs and taps.  Watch how the camera, attached to DiCaprio, follows the drooling drug victim to the floor as we viscerally experience this kick-in.  What follows is a performer falling into total physical and emotional embodiment, the result of incredible confidence and preparation as he crawls down the stairs to his car with something like a cerebral palsy equivalent.  And then he tumbles down brick stairs - the tumbling point of view shows a long staircase, the result shows a short fall - Scorsese is at the top of his game, and has more tricks like this coming.  Some audiences may be incapable of interpreting such ideas as Belfort's perspective showing him and his car getting home in one piece, weighed against another perspective showing they most certainly did not.  Belfort struggles to speak, fighting to get Donnie off the phone.  The only soundtrack at this point is Pop-Eye on the TV nearby, an image of spinach pumping him up inspiring Jordan to take coke and save Donnie, who is now choking.  Jordan gets by, Brad decides not to rat, but he is now heavily advised to give some things up, because all eyes are officially on him.  Scorsese gave us nearly two straight hours of music-filled adrenaline, then changed the pacing and momentum for this sequence, while not being any less entertaining.  It's a remarkable cinematic achievement.  The film continues this way, free of music, as Jordan tries to say goodbye to Stratton Oakmont, a tear-filled emotional scene (for them) as the kool-aid drinkers mourn his leaving the company.  And then it all changes, he decides he can't let go.  Denham learns the news, and the party starts again, on a yacht with \"Hey-Ho\" playing.  Now it's only a matter of time, but a rush of new adrenaline surges forth. \r\n\r\nAnd then comes God, Scorsese's favorite character, almost a deus-ex-machina when they rush across the sea on his yacht, against the captain's recommendation for fear of storm conditions.  All hell breaks loose in another wildly shot trip through twenty foot waves, an impossible circumstance with jet-skis and a helicopter flying off, more than just the broken dishes they anticipated.  All Belfort can think is that he doesn't want to die sober, tasking Donnie to get the Quaaludes.  They smash into the ultimate wave, cutting into the unexpected sound of \"Gloria\" as they are saved from their capsized ship.  Randomly, a plane blows up killing three people as everyone dances, nobody notices and it passes by as a near dream element.  Jordan Belfort feels he's ready to change his life, falling into the financial advice business with infomercials.  Denham interrupts one of these shoots, making for a far more interesting way of seeing an arrest than conventional.  Denham offers some legal advice, \"shut the fuck up.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of the film we see a mirror, we are Jordan's kool-aid drinking audience, sitting across seeing ourselves.  We're captivated, we can't deny we want to know his secrets, and he's spilling them out in an information session.  The idea of the telephone POV recurs in the most literal form.  It's one of the most brilliant endings I've ever taken part in.",

Because for all the good wrapped in these hours, there is a lot of room to fill. It's repetition--how many hookers do you need to see banged? How many lines of coke snorted? Ludes popped? The Wolf of Wall Street goes swimming in excess to the point that we as viewers become numb to the whole exercise.\n\nThen there is the hearty speeches delivered by Leonardo DiCaprio. He stands addressing his employees, delivering motivational speeches, and it's all the same BS, and they creak on and on, filling up these precious minutes.\n\nThere's something to be said for painting a deep, intimate portrait of the character of Jordan Belfort, but I don't know that The Wolf of Wall Street actually succeeds in doing that. Instead we get the standard rise-and-fall story--it's all surface-level. Actions that beget actions, arguments that fall into other actions, and actions that fall into arguments or hugs or what-have-you. \n\nAnd maybe there isn't anything to the character of Jordan Belfort except excess--but that's not a person that a 3-hour movie can sustain.\n\nBut despite the length, and the excess of excesses, and utter shallowness of everything, The Wolf of Wall Street maintains a sort of flow that works. Sure, it should have been an hour less--cutting the excess and some unimportant scenes would do a world of good--but every actor seemed to put their heart into their roles.\n\nWatching them on screen is just nice. It's comfortable. DiCaprio? He's always good and he's very good here. Jonah Hill finds himself excelling in a role that isn't a teen stoner comedy. Go down the list of actors with major screen time and it's just a pleasure to see them on screen. \n\nAnd so even as the collected whole is a lumbering piece of cinema unworthy of 3-hours of film, unworthy of the praises and accolades piled on it, the individual scenes fly by.",

I expected to not enjoy this movie mainly because I thought that it would be very technical in regards to the financial content. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the technical information was there, and it was delivered in a format that was both informative and understandable, even to the Wall Street dummies like me. I was a bit taken aback by the sheer volume of debauchery portrayed. I never thought I'd see a movie with more blatant and prolific drug use than De Palma's 1983 flick Scarface, but this movie wins that trophy hands down.

If we just look at the surface of the film content, some people may think that is cruel and unrespectable film since there has many foul languages being spoken out. Lots of sexual scenes have been showed as well. However, I do think those \"immoral scenes\" has been lightened up the main ideas and the mind of Jordon. Without those scenes, it can't really let the audience to feel which kind of life Jordon is living. \n\nIndeed, I do think this film has some educational feedbacks to teach people nowadays.\nFor example, in presence of drug abuse scene and sexual scene, Jordon's life looks impressive and well-regarded as he can get what he wants. However, after this luxurious life, he left nothing. Leonardo has risen up the movie so good because of the acting but the ridiculous thing is the other criteria are full of humors and sexual stuffs have turned into superfluous thing.\n\nAll in all, this film is a revolting, incredible work to show how a human can has so many transformations in his life.

The film decries none of these things, but it does decry them, and anything, really, in excess, and in particular the excess displayed inside the corrupted halls of Stratton Oakmont. The picture thrives on balance, even as it plays up Jordan's excesses almost to a breaking point. The film zooms well past the point of no return early on and will certainly offend many viewers with its unabashed depiction of wealth-induced narcotic, sexual, and verbal indulgence, but within that chaos is a purpose that trumps all of the visual and aural mayhem. It's easily one of the year's finest pictures and a must-see for audiences that can compartmentalize the film's structure and purpose and find the beautiful interconnect between them.",

            "content": "This year I have seen many acclaimed films, and while I've really enjoyed many of them, for a long time I have seen nothing that I have flat out loved. That changed with The Wolf of Wall Street. Told by some friends that it was terrific, and by others that it was downright terrible, I approached the movie cautiously, knowing I was in for a love-it or hate-it experience. As it turns out, I did very much love this movie, and it is probably my favorite film to come out in 2013.\nThis movie is one that is not for the faint of heart. For three hours, viewers witness Jordan Belfort's rise to riches, as well as his decline into a life filled with alcohol, drug abuse, and promiscuous sexual activity. The movie never shies away from these aspects, and in fact, many viewers left the movie believing that the filmmakers worked to glamorize them. While Belfort's life initially looks awesome, and his aggressive charm lures you into almost rooting for him, one thing that any viewer should understand is that you are not supposed to look up to any of these characters. For the most part, the film's protagonist and the supporting characters are amoral sleazeballs who desire to get rich with not a care to whoever they trample in their path to wealth. Once the viewer realizes that they are not supposed to idolize Belfort and his companions, they can better understand the movie.\nWhat really makes this film so memorable is the duo effort of Scorsese and DiCaprio. Scorsese is at his best, channeling that same energy and intensity that made Goodfellas an instant classic. DiCaprio feeds off of that, giving in my opinion his greatest performance yet as the charismatic, driven, and ultimately tragic stock broker Jordan Belfort. Throughout the films long running time, DiCaprio helped ensure that I was almost consistently captivated by the misadventures and ridiculous circumstances that plagued Belfort's life story. Among the many supporting characters, Jonah Hill stands out, giving his own best performance as the wild-eyed finance weasel Donnie Azoff. Hill nearly stole the show from Leo, which is in itself a feat. Finally Margot Robbie and Joanna Lumbly deserve special mention as the film's standout women who end up being dragged down by Jordan's relentless path toward wealth.\nWhile the film's buzzes with Scorsese's directing, and great acting, Terence Winter also deserves some credit for adapting Belfort's memoir into a lengthy and epic film. The movie functions as both a drama, and as a black comedy as Belfort and his gang bring about some ludicrous situations throughout the movie. The film's dialogue while incredibly profane, is darkly comic, completely absorbing, and very much in line with the decidedly morally ambiguous characters. My only gripes with the films is that even though it was entertaining throughout, it did run a bit too long in the end, and there was a lack of focus when it came to the films's central plot. While the movie did a great job in showing Jordan's rise to wealth and his subsequent rough relationship with the FBI, the movie never felt like it built up to a powerful climax. However I did appreciate how at the film's end, Belfort and his fellow wall street scum do end up being incarcerated for their sins, which in my opinion, shows the film's moral message. Overall this is not a movie for everyone, and those who avoid extreme content should steer clear of this one. However if you are an adult and open-minded viewer, you just might be enthralled by Jordan Belfort's sprawling, excessive, and irreverent tale. I know I was.",

Jordan Belfort is the repugnant stock broker who 'steals from the rich and gives to himself'. An ostentatious super-rich man dripping in excess, achieved through deceit and fraud, and we follow along on his rise and inevitable fall.\n\nThe whole movie is garish, every single wonderful second and screams of Scorsese style. It is not for everyone and certainly not the faint of heart given the prevalence of nudity, sex and drugs (oh, the drugs!).  It is loud, bold, and just shy of ludicrous but equally hilarious, anchored by the performances of Leonardo DiCaprio as Jordan Belfort and Jonah Hill, Belfort's right hand man Donnie Azoff.\n\nIt is nominated for five Academy Awards, a sizable number worthy of pride for all those involved. Though, if it doesn't win for at least one of the categories in which the picture is nominated, given the sheer undertaking of the film, then the whole award show is a sham because it deserves some recognition.\n\nI want to explain why, I want to reference scenes to prove my point, I really do, but if I did I would be spoiling the experience.

Martin Scorsese has managed to make his worst film. But what makes it so bad? Why do the masses seem to enjoy this film? Well so many questions to be answered and so little time. So here is my look at The Wolf of Wall Street.\n\nIn The Wolf of Wall Street DiCaprio plays Belfort, a Long Island penny stockbroker who served 36 months in prison for defrauding investors in a massive 1990s securities scam that involved widespread corruption on Wall Street and in the corporate banking world, including shoe designer Steve Madden.\n\nThe film starts off on a high note, I found the start of the film to be intriguing this is where we meet who I think the film should have followed in Mark Hanna played by Matt McConaughey. But as quickly as he is introduced he leaves the film. Thus starts the downfall of the film in what should have been a gritty, dark and dirty film about Belfort is more of a MTV True Life episode with actual actors. The comedy is dull at best and rehashed through out the film. We do come to see the insanity of this life style but the problem is that for most of the film that's all you see. It slowly begins to wear you down and there is little to no redeeming quality's. At the hour and forty five minute mark I found myself checking out. The film couldn't hold my focus. The film should have ended at an hour and forty five minute mark but it continued and much like the drugs in the film it started to hammer my sense. The few actors who tried to make the film better simply were not enough. Dicaprio once again stumbles into another role that isn't going to win him an award. I can't say to much for the other performances because I soon forgot the film.",

The cast were having the time of their lives, and the writing is really good. The direction is amazing, the plot is really good and there's no scene that wasn't necessary. It doesn't idolize the main character for what he's doing, which is wrong. It's hilarious, but the only problem I had, is that there's no emotional moment from the victims that got their money taken away from there, there's no scene of them either.

            "content": "Review In A Nutshell:\n\nThe Wolf of Wall Street tells the rise and fall of Jordan Belfort. This is the type of film that I am able to easily predict what happens at the start and at the end of the film, so instead of looking for these surprises; what I look for in a film like this are aspects like character development, interesting dialogue, and messages or themes that would make this film stand out from the rest. The Wolf of Wall Street was able to bring two of those three things.\n\nThe film featured a fascinating protagonist that Scorsese handles beautifully. Belfort's personality and the endeavours he gets himself into are handled in such an indulgent way, stretching out the film for almost 3 hours. Scorsese wanted this film to show us as much as he can about the character in order for the audience to gain a strong understanding and makes his personal vices to truly feel like crutches in his life; having at least the first hour and a half showing us the excess of sex and drugs that he lived through and the joy he gained out of it. If he summarized this into an hour and 45 minute film then this would have been a film that I could easily shrug off and forget in the near future. None of this could have been as effective of course, if it wasn't for the brilliant, energetic and charismatic performance from Leonardo DiCaprio, I have seen sides of his acting range that I didn't even know existed, though I do want to point out that his role in this film isn't very different from the ones he has already played, containing attributes like wealthy and charming, but at least here he pushes his own boundaries unlike the others. I can't say this film is my favourite from his as that crown goes to his raw performance on Revolutionary Road.\n\nOne of the other reasons why this film remained entertaining was its dialogue. It features strong profanity that captured both the character and the profession he is in. There are some wonderful back and forth in this film, particularly between Belfort and his second wife or Donnie. Whenever he has a conversation between them, it always creates either a sense of fun or tension. I also enjoyed listening to the exchanges between DiCaprio and McConaughey, as I was able to learn so much about the world they are in and what is required in order to stay alive and maintain a sense of sanity.\n\nMy issue with the film is its thematic concerns or messages, as I feel like this has been something that I have seen multiple times in films of this nature. It speaks about the American dream where anybody can just find success through hard work and taking chances. Belfort took a chance on a small business, then moved out and made his own; from there he became wealthy and famous. Though I was a little disappointed with the film's recycled themes, it is definitely better made film than Scarface, through its flashy and glamorous direction and a much better written timeline of events. Coming into this, I did somewhat hope for this film to impress me the same way that Barry Lyndon did, a film that also uses the rise and fall storyline, but sadly it failed.\n\nAfter just expressing my disappointments with the film, I hope you don't think that this is a bad film as it is far from that, but Scorsese has definitely delivered others that are better.",

Not only are they power house movies but their ability to be watched and enjoyed again and again, countless times, grant them the title of cinema masterpieces. The Wolf Of Wall Street can now join that list. Scorsese has always made monolithic films, shattered critical acclaim and broken all sorts of boundries since he began work in the industry, however Wolf Of Wall Street is not only one of his strongest efforts in the last decade, it may well be up there with the likes of Taxi Driver, Mean Streats and Casino. Dicaprio plays Jordan Belfront a multi millionaire play boy, with an huge addiction to sex, drugs and rock and roll and a hard on for the stock market. Wolf Of Wall Street, see's the story of a stock broker work his way through the ranks until creating his own company Stratton, who deal in selling shares and bumping their every customer. We see the,. essentially the rise and fall of a wild child and what a ride. Dicaprio is off the hook in this modern day Fear And Loathing, bringing not only a wide range of characterisation but hilarity also. But he's not alone here, the cast from hollywood big shots to a smaller time ensemble all pitch in award winning efforts and make this film come truely to life. Jonah Hill is majestic, Rob Reiner is stunning, Matthew McConaughey almost steals the show near the beginning of the movie. Even Joanna Lumley shows up to add a bit of brittish charm to the piece. Its a power house of performances, working from a spell binding script. Dialogue flows thick and fast, hilarious, vulgar, charming, hypnotic.One scene see's Belfort starting out in a small time company and within minutes rattle out a sales pitch that has you as an audience member sold. His speeches to his co workers are as empowering as they are encapsulating. The films strikes a brilliant balance between comedy and drama, vulgarity and violence, there is nothing this film does not have. One scene sees Dicaprio and Hill over loading on ludes to hilarious effect, in a scene that kept me laughing for well over ten minutes, before becoming incredibly distressing. The edit is pin sharp and precise. Not one moment of this film is boring and thats a feat conisidering its length. The camera work is stunning, the locations and gorgeous, the grade is shiney and glorious. Well lit, well acted, well edited and directed and the soundtrack is to die for, a mix of early nineties pop to Foo Fighters. There is nothing this film cant handle well. There are occasional niggles here and there, an annoying continuity error here and there, needless braking of the fourth wall in places and slight rounding up of plot issues in places leave this film from being close to perfect. However none of these are distracting in a way that will cripple your enjoyment. Its been a long time since i have enjoyed a movie this much. A classic if ever i saw one.",

Everyone's gets sucked in by this guy, including, apparently, Martin Scorcese, who took Belfort's own drug-enhanced accounts of his antics and added an extra Hollywood tweak. Real life footage of the company parties look boring; the real life 'duchess' is, well, plain; and Belfort himself is just a slime ball. Now building a career as a self-help guru passing on the 'secrets' that enabled him to amass a multimillion dollar fortune to less enlightened folk, 'making money is easy' he says. People attending Jordan Belfort's seminars ought to be aware of just one 'secret' and it's not the one he lectures about. Unless you can lie through your teeth while appearing to be a person of honesty and integrity, unless you can make promises that disappear even as a new thought enters your head, unless you are the sort of person who would sell your own grandmother for a better set of wheels, you will never be like Jordan Belfort (is that one or three?). Having said that the film is mildly amusing, in a Police Academy sort if way, although far too long and a little irritating to have Scorcese recycle the narrative format of Goodfellas and foist it on us again",

While I would not put this movie ahead of Goodfellas, I would put Leo's performance as way better than Liotta's. Up there with De Niro as Travis Bickle in \"Taxi Driver.\" It is much more comedic than any other Scorsese film, but some real drama where necessary and unlike the typical Scorsese violence, Martin replaces it with a lot of sexuality. This is shocking at first but considering the context, it would have to be necessary.

The movie itself carries a touch of an epic movie with preposterous scenes, colourful settings, crazy characters, pumped up egos, nudity, drugs, money, sex, lies, loss, failure, success and excessive lifestyles. Some critics has viewed the movie as an irresponsible glorification rather than a satirical takedown of Belfort\u00b4s life. DiCaprio responded that in his opinion the film does not glorify the lifestyle it depicts. I reckon the movies reeks from both. I sense in one way that Scorsese/Dicaprio were having a ball playing out everything they could and using Belfort\u00b4s craziness partly as an alibi to do whatever on the screen. For sure has both the real Belfort and the screenwriter added and changed things to make it look even more crazier than it might have been. The movie shows how easy it is to get caught up in the grab for success, where money rules and anything goes. But, the balance of it or rather the downside is not portrayed as much, which does create an unbalance in the film. With this said, Dicaprio is still giving us one hell of a performance and so is Jonah Hill as they are mostly in focus. Dicaprio is on a high literally when portraying Belfort and some scenes will stick in the back of your mind for sure. Like the Lemon scene and Belfort\u00b4s attempt to drive home. The movie has a high energy driven pace and I do like the idea of having Belfort talking to the camera in numerous scenes. Most of the female roles such as the beautiful Aussie Margot Robbie\u00b4s Naomi becomes undressed backdrops and they are more or less just pieces of meat to enjoy, which also creates an unbalance in the film. However, I reckon Scorsese wasn\u00b4t aiming at having really strong female characters to \"disturb\" the excess of Belfort. The end message is ultimately \"Money rules and anything goes\" which of course shows us no real moral agenda within the structure of the movie and that is of course something you can question.",

Hell yeah, definitely zoned out a couple times because of some boring stock broking plot that I would be lost half of the time. But what sucked me back in, was the amazing performances by the leads. First off, I know Leo wasn't going to win the Oscar (Matthew lost 40lbs. that is dedication) but this is without a doubt his best performance yet. He goes on an emotional journey as Jordan Belfort, a man who starts out as a lone wolf on Wall Street and after a few connections are made and his mentor Mark Henna (played hilariously and memorable by McConaughey) he becomes the anti-hero as he changes his entire personality. The transformation isn't what is mesmorizing, it's his charisma and business man confidence that wins everyone over. Same goes to Jonah Hill, as Donnie Azoff his friend/co worker who along with DiCaprio does his best work as well. The two are mesmorizing together and individually and once the FBI is on their case it only gets funnier for the two as well as more tense as their characters once again change their entire personalities. The supporting cast is great too as each and every cast member has their moment in the spotlight whether it is a laugh or a big plot twist that changes the course of the movie, everyone earns their pay checks. It may be full of sexist jokes, along with some throw away gags/plot holes that aren't nessasary, but when you have a cast this talented and this much energy,you can't look away. The minute Hill and DiCaprio take their first pill/snort their first amount of crack, that's when everything kicks into high gear and it gets awesome. Overall, this movie is not for everyone and it obviously did not get as much critical acclaim as Scorses and DiCaprio had hoped, but I liked it and can look past a few of its minor problems.",

DiCaprio's sense of craziness and humor makes this film hilarious to watch. One scene, DiCaprio goes full retard, but pulls it off. His physical movements and his face are all so funny, and with Scorcese's pairing and direction, the film pulls it off very well. From start to end, DiCaprio always has your attention, and he very well stands out to me as 2013's best lead male performance, and the funniest male performance I've ever seen. Leonardo DiCaprio has proven himself with drama, with romance, and now with comedy. Definitely one of my favorite actors now, his diversity is ever changing as he continues to act on. Brilliant, fun, and over the top, DiCaprio gives one of the best performances I've seen in a while, all the whole adding to the best movie of 2013.\r\n\r\n   The Wolf of Wall Street is a 2013 comedy drama written by Terrence Winter and directed by Martin Scorsese. It stars the brilliant Leonardo DiCaprio, stellar Jonah Hill, Jon Berenthal, Margot Robbie, Rob Reiner, Kyle Chandler, Jean Dujardin  and much more. Terrence Winter's writing is very good in this movie. While at times I thought the use of the f-word in every sentence was used only for comedy sake and for lack of clever writing, I still enjoyed it. The language is so frequent I didn't even notice it about forty-five minutes into it, and I enjoyed it very much. The plot is one heck of a thrill ride, a non-stop drug, sex, and hilarity filled joy ride that goes through Jordan's life as the most despicable guy on Wall Street. I never got tired of it and I think about the insanity almost every day. The three-hour long length of the movie might seem strenuous, but it wasn't for me and I always wish there was more to watch in this movie. It's the perfect guy movie second only to Fight Club, but I will definitely show this movie over Fight Club in my house any day now. Terrence Winter writes a movie that's long, insane, stupid, and crazy, and every second of it is engrossing and enjoyable to watch.\r\n\r\n   As I've said in previous reviews, I'm not the biggest Martin Scorsese fan. I enjoy a lot of his work, and I think most of it is good, rather than great. His editing style can get a tad bit (and when I mean tad, I mean very) annoying, and his lack of consistency or reason for a lot of his directing choices make his films very awkward to watch sometimes. But it makes me very happy to say that Scorsese knocked this film out of the park, and finally made a really great film. He channeled his awkwardness, random editing, and insanity into this film, maybe putting some weird direction here and there but it was not noticeable because it fit with the film. The atmosphere of\r\nthe film was always a bit crazy, and at times it also didn't take it self seriously, and when it wasn't making fun of itself, the script was making fun of the characters and everything else. Scorcese did have his touch of annoying, unexplained bad editing, and it was very noticeable in one scene, but at other times I didn't notice it in the film. Scorcese had a full grasp on the insanity in this film, and his comedic timing and cinematography were well used. Scorcese directs this film like no other, and every single second of the three hours was a joy to watch, and while wt times when the film was supposed to be serious, it lacked in the seriousness of it, but other than that excellent direction. It makes me very happy that Scorsese made a film like this, and in total it has become my favorite film of his, even beating out greats such as Raging Bull and Goodfellas.\r\n\r\n   The acting in this film was also very, very good. From Jonah Hill to Rob Reiner, all of the characters had a moment to shine and all of them had mastered comedic timing other than Margot Robbie, who was mostly in the film for Jordan Belfort's morality checks. As previously stated, DiCaprio is a monster who knows how to use over the top acting and make it work. I loved his accent, I loved his narration, I loved his facial expressions and I loved his step away from drama. He's an anti-hero who you should hate, but you can't help but root for him and love him. Jonah Hill plays his right-hand man, and he received an Oscar nomination for his role in this film. He is also very hilarious, but surprisingly, not as good as DiCaprio, but still excellent. Other actors such as Jean Dujardin had funny moments in the film, and Belfort's gang of loathsome stock brokers are all a blast to watch throughout. Spike Jonze also makes an appearance in the film, and I really liked him in it, too. In total, the acting in The Wolf of Wall Street is full-blown, overdone, rambunctious and completely perfect for this film.\r\n\r\n   From Scorsese's direction to Terrence Winter's writing, everything in this film is only one thing: insane. While the writing could have used less language for comedy, and the direction could've been a bit more serious when needed, not much is wrong with this film. Winter writes hilarious, smart dialogue, encompassing a man who doesn't deserve to be happy in a very joyful movie. Marty's direction also adds craziness to the film, telling Jordan Belfort's story as detailed as possible, which called for a lot of mad sequences and over the top film. The entire cast is great, and with Jonah Hill leading the supporting cast, I expected nothing less than comedic gold. Leonardo DiCaprio is the main man of the film, and without him, the film would not be the same. From start to end Leo leads the movie and pulls the audience along in through his shenanigans, and I needed more and more. I've seen Leo in almost all his major films, but nothing like this has ever come up from him on screen. I really did love this film, and I have to give cograts to the entire cast and crew, for it is my favorite film of 2013 without a doubt. And one of my favorite films of all tims. 10/10.\r\n\r\n   Please check out my podcast!

This movie has everything. Money is Jordan's life and it displays this very well as the movie is a three hour long portrait on Money, drugs, and sex and how it affects peoples lives for the worse and for the better.

            "content": "The film started off good showing Belfort build his empire from the bottom, thought that was interesting. Then once he's successful (30 minutes in the film?) it's nothing but two hours of nonstop sex, drugs, violence, and so on. I don't have a problem with this content, but it doesn't do much to move the story along. We get it, they like the party, but must it take so long to get the point across?\r\n\r\nI know it's sacrilege to say this, but Michael Bay got it right in Pain & Gain. Another film with lots of sex, drugs, and partying, but it moves the story along more efficiently. For example, when Paul Doyle (the Rock) gets addicted to drugs, he loses all his money which then causes the group to execute another illegal operation. It advances the story and presents us with another conflict.\r\n\r\nIn The Wolf of Wall Street, there's really no major conflict. The FBI is involved but it feels too much in the background as Scorsese wants all the partying to be the main focus. This then makes the climax feel rushed (if that silly boat scene was the climax). Although, I did like Jordan going undercover and found those parts to be interesting. \r\n\r\nSeeing more of the inner workings of the corrupt side of the business would have been nice, but what we get is way too brief. Another issue is that all the characters lack depth, maybe aside from Belfort. It's not that they are unlikable, but that they are uninteresting and don't change throughout the film. Everyone is boring as hell.\r\n\r\nThere's no substance to the film and overall it's a waste of time. I wanted a story with better conflicts and stronger character development, not a bunch of endless nonsense that really equates to nothing. All the partying isn't even related to the corruption of his business and the FBI involvement, which is where the focus should have been. \"We're coming after you because you party too hard!\" Also, how about showing us the victims of Belfort's operations, showing us more of what he did? The film doesn't know what it wants to be. A big pointless party? Or a crime film like we somewhat got in the last 30 minutes or so? The latter would have been nice, but instead we mostly get nonsense.",

Bellfort lives it up in every sense of the word: drugs, hookers, crazy parties, expensive restaurants, you name it! He is so charismatic, charming, \nand brilliant that I could not help but fall in love with the character. He is a stock broker who is very good at what he does, and takes all his associates with him on a crazy thrill ride! Leonardo is totally on fire in this performance. Never in my life have a seen an actor give such an intense and aggressively funny \nperformance. The film is a total satire, and it works. There is just no way this would have worked with a serious script. Jonah Hill is equally hilarious as Bellforts closest associate and first partner in his stock broker firm. The film is about three hours long and could have done with a few trims here and there. Overall, this film is an exercise in bad-taste and shamelessness, but it is so freaking funny and brilliantly done that I could not help but root  for Bellfort. He is not really a bad person, but he certainly relished in the high-life that his wealth afforded him! \nThere are some surprisingly emotional moments in this film as well, such as a tear-inducing speech he gives to his associates and a very intense break up he has with his shallow and materialistic wife. This whole movie is so intense both in its humor and kinetic energy, that it seems to leap off the screen and into your face. it is a wonder that this man is still alive after everything he went through!

This biting satire goes full throttle in panning the anti-ethics culture of wall street stockbrokers as well as the anti-capitalist legislation in the US which practically allows these monsters to get away with murder. In my opinion Wolf of Wall Street serves as a fine addition to the Scorsese gangster biopic series.The sense of tunnel vision these guys get is so effectively conveyed with the director never missing a beat in showing their disregard for empathy and morality in the face of another high, whether it be hookers, quaaludes, cocaine, heroine, money or throwing little people.",

In Wolf of Wall Street tries to be the Goodfellas of the New York stock exchange world. In Goodfellas you rooted for the villains and you wanted to be a gangster, and he aims for this same effect for the corrupt Wall Street broker played by Dicaprio. Ultimately he fails, and the movie in the good years goes on too long and really does not have enough variation to it. The support characters aside from Hill are not memorable at all and I couldn't careless what happened to them, but when you saw Sorvino and Dinero go to prison in Goodfellas you were crushed. The fall in Wall Street was just mundane and stereotypical. Dicaprio was fine, but many times I felt I could have been more inspired by his pep talks and I never really routed for him. Overall Wolf of Wall-street takes too long to get to the point and does not have strong enough characters to carry you on the emotional roller coaster that Scorsese has taken us in his previous epic masterpieces.",

The story gives us viewers a look behind the scenes of a stockbroker company, where drugs, money and decadency are primal and will eventually lead to a downfall. I enjoyed the film a lot. Some parts where really funny, and I must praise DiCaprio for his brilliant performance. Also starring Jonah Hill (Superbad, This is the End), Matthew McConaughey (Dallas Buyers Club, Amistad) and Margot Robbie. Want to make easy money?\n\nJordan Belfort (DiCaprio) is an ambitious young man when he joins the established Wall Street firm LF Rothschild. His boss (McConaughey) advises him to adapt a life of sex and drugs in order to succeed in the world of stock exchange. Unfortunately, Jordan soon loses his job because of bankruptcy as a result of Black Monday. In his next job Belfort learns how to earn money due to commissions in penny stocks.  As a result he decides to start his own stock exchange business with the help from his neighbor Donnie Azof (Hill). In the following years the firm expands and both men are adapt the decadent lifestyle of sex and drugs. But will their luck remain unchanged?",

I know the movie was showing how craven they were but it all became unintentionally funny after a short time. Leonardo was great as usual; an amazing actor who deserves an Oscar sometime soon.

He is the most energetic character in the movie, but not at all likeable.  I hope the movie doesn't make people want to be amoral stockbrokers, but I fear it will.",

Although the film is about serious issues, there is some really funny scenes, especially between DiCaprio and Hill who had great chemistry. The storyline goes from one extreme to the next, which is what made it hard to believe that it was based on a true story. The amount of money that the traders go through is ridiculous and the whole care free attitude had to come to a holt at some point. At nearly 3 hours long, the director done well to keep the movie interesting and a joy to watch. I never thought that I would say this, but it is in the same class as the original Wall Street which was a tough act to follow. A Great Watch!\n\nRound-Up:\nDiCaprio really showed that he is a top class actor with his performance in this movie. He really needed to dig deep to make this character believable because of the amount of drugs, cash and women that him and his friends went through, under the eyes of the law. Jonah Hill was an excellent choice to play DiCaprio's partner in crime who also showed that a different side to his acting skills. Even Matthew McConaughey was brilliant, with his weird expressions and phrases which were a great way to kick off the movie. Anyway, it's very hard to find anything wrong with this film, although some of the speeches on the microphone did drag on, but that's just me being picky. Its  definitely worth a watch! \n\nBudget: $100million\nWorldwide Gross: $390million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into there witty dramas about the crazy world of a stock trader who works hard and definitely parties extremely hard. 8/10",

For the Soundtrack, there were many Artists (Various Artists) that gave it their all to make The Wolf of Wall Street 5 Stars. Personally, I felt like the music was perfectly placed throughout the movie when it came to the Sex, the Drugs, and the Money. The Editor, Thelma Schoonmaker did a wonderful job with the overlaying of the score to the Motion Picture. Congrats to all of you! I give you my applaud, to the Actors, especially the Actresses, the Director, the Writers, the Editors, and the Various Artists that led The Wolf of Wall Street to be a 5 Star Motion Picture. As always, Martin Scorsese is a legendary director among many in the Streets of Hollywood. He brings his game to the tables and that is what makes him the Man of Movies. My favorite Actor Leonardo DiCaprio did a splendid job on bringing us the true reality of what it truly means to bring the Sex, the Drugs, and the Money.",

That said, it was interesting to see the story play out, and Leo is pretty good ranging from his different phases (although really people, it's so \"Oscar set\" but it doesn't feel like it's anything different from DiCaprio before.  Why should he win just because he has done work like this in the past, versus doing something bold and interesting?)  The rest of the ensemble, while fun (like Hill, Reiner, Favreau, etc) just really doesn't feel more than caricatures, and even worse than American Hustle since it was clear they weren't supposes to be.  Then there are the obvious plot problems.  If people know they are in a pump and dump scheme, wouldn't they catch on to Belfort?  Wouldn't the investors stop investing?

What really did it for me was DiCaprio's moments where he speaks to the camera, breaking the fourth wall explaining what is going on, it's like a direct invitation into the world of Belfort's dirty work. \r\n\r\nIndulging in excess, bad behaviour and general debauchery, this Oscar nominated movie boasts sharp writing and a phenomenal cast full of talent. They are impeccable delivering perfect performances, DiCaprio is at his A-game as is Jonah Hill too, plus Margot Robbie, P.J. Byrne and Cristin Milioti are spectacular supporting cast actors who shine as bright as their lead star. Best of all, this movie has a true life story worth telling, but running in at three hours long there were times where I felt some scenes were unnecessary or just too bloody long, although not long enough in the case of Belfort's prison sentence. Either way, some will want more, I felt it was excess but there are some truly brilliant moments worth mentioning.\r\n\r\nThe scene where Jordan and Donnie take a strong type of quaalude called the Lemmon-714, the aftermath is hilarious as Jordan essentially freezes, drools and crawls his way to his car, driving home unscathed, or so he thinks, and it's called the \"Cerebral Palsy\" drug effect. My favourite scene though is the leaving speech, you actually feel a little bit bad for Belfort, but then you think to yourself why after all the bad things, then of course he flips and states clearly \"I'M FUCKING STAYING\". \r\n\r\nWith over 500 f-bomb drops, drug and alcohol abuse like never before and pure style, The Wolf Of Wall Street has to be seen, and whilst I think it's not Oscar worthy aside from it's performances, the hype and reviews say it all, it's unmissable and intoxicatingly watchable.",

Jonah Hill did a good job playing his character and showed that he does have some acting skills. Movie is a bit long but worth is. Story is an based on a true one.

But I forgot this was a Scorcese movie, so that explains it. \n\nLeonardo DiCaprio is terrific as the debaucherous man-boy, Jordan Belfort. Jonah Hill is equally wonderful as his sidekick, Donnie. There's quite a few laugh out loud moments in this movie, and many of them have to do with these two vibing off each other. The outrageous and lengthy lude scene at Jordan's house comes to mind here. All of the acting is top-notch. Even Margot Robbie, who plays Jordan's second wife, is turns in a great performance. By seeing her in the opening scenes, my mind immediately thought she was there to just be eye candy. A brainless, one-dimensional character that had no real bond or relationship with Jordan. I was very wrong, and she had so much more to offer than what I originally thought. \n\nWOWS is manic, crass, and engaging. It pulls us into this crazy world of people with entirely too much money on their hands. It is one heck of a ride to sit through this movie, honestly. The movie doesn't celebrate the kind of lifestyle Jordan and his buddies lead, but it definitely has a lot of fun in its portrayal of it. I may not have understood a whole lot of what was being explained sometimes but it was nonetheless interesting. Sometimes you're not even sure if you should laugh or just shake your head in astonishment that this is what goes on behind the closed doors of those Wall Street offices. \n\nDefinitely worth seeing.",

            "content": "With Wall Street being as challenging as it is, \"Wolf of Wall Street\" serves as the one of the best movies gearing on Wall Street ever made.\n\nThat also serves for management skills. Everyone has the talent to influence their customers efficiently and professionally. There are necessities to show to people what to expect if they ever want to do anything with sales, management, or dealing anything that is in the business of money-making.\n\nOnce brokers start bringing in the big bucks, there are many risks that they start to take to become even more richer than they expect. Yes, the work place is not pretty in Wall Street. The foul language, the jealousy of other brokers, and the stress leads to negative effect. For Jordan Belfort though, he is the brokers motivational man to prove them that it is better to deal with problems by becoming rich than sitting around.\n\nMartin Scorsese's \"Wolf Of Wall Street\" is very realistic on the true story of Jordan Belfort (played by Leonardo DiCaprio). Belfort started his business Stratton Oakmont in an abandoned auto-body shop. He hires a bunch of brokers with very little experience and an assistant named Donnie Azoff (played by Jonah Hill) another inexperienced broker, however Belfort turns Donnie into his top assistant for how motivated he is to become rich.\n\nAs soon as Belfort starts bringing in hard cash, he starts to make so much money that he does not know what to do with it. As soon as he runs out of options, his money spending consists of drugs, hookers, alcoholism, expensive boats, and above all vulgarity.\n\nThe opening of a movie is Belfort throwing midgets at money targets and almost crashing a chopper since he is flying his chopper while being high on drugs. The opening basically already gives viewers an idea of what were going to expect in this three hour film. DiCaprio does some brief descriptions of his life, how rich he is, and briefly about how so many authorities are after him (will not explain why otherwise that would be giving away too much of the movie).\n\nWhat stood out for me in this movie is how someone like Belfort could take so many drugs and get through the day. How could he take cocaine, quaaludes, and morphine all at once. Does he have a schedule to plan them accordingly? Did he take some kind of chemistry course that gives him an idea of how the drugs work together? Or does he just evolve with the drugs over time? \"Wolf Of Wall Street\" has the answer to those questions. It also knows the effects of drugs and what quantity is over-dosing and dangerous.\n\nThis is one of my all time favorite movies. I have seen many films relating to Wall Street. Good and bad ones, however after experiencing this masterpiece by Scorsese, it makes viewers feel like they are just watching a movie relating to Wall Street for the first time.\n\nThis is the fifth film that Scorsese has worked with DiCaprio on. After working with DiCaprio for a variety of films including \"The Aviator\" \"Shutter Island\" \"The Departed\" and many more, Scorsese knows how someone like DiCaprio can deliver a knockout performance in a movie.\n\nAlso for DiCaprio I have realized that he also incorporates brilliant ideas to make this film successful. The chest beating scene with Matthew McConaughey (as Mark Hanna) and DiCaprio was an idea by DiCaprio. He realized that McConaughey's process before a movie to keep the attitude going was to do the chest beat. As soon as DiCaprio realizes this, he mentioned it to both Scorsese and McConaughey, they put in their film, and it just makes the film even more enthralling than it already is.\n\nOverall, \"Wolf Of Wall Street\" is one not to be missed. It is surprisingly still in some theaters and on DVD and blue ray. I recommend if viewers have the opportunity to see it in the theaters still see it there because it is the big screen experience. Be ready for the thrill ride of raunchiness and vulgarity but make it one to remember. Four stars.",

            "content": "The constant theme of Martin Scorsese's best work are the temptations of the flesh, never more aptly seen than though the prism of real-life subjects.  He's explored this through Jake LaMotta, Howard Hughes, Henry Hill and Jesus Christ, but in his new film The Wolf of Wall Street, Jordan Belfort may have the most savage appetite of them all.  Here, Scorsese turns his camera to the greed and avarice of the stock market boom of the late 80s that he sees in almost the same way as his great film Goodfellas, with a kid from the middle class who finds a short-route to riches and unapologetically enjoys the anything-goes lifestyle.  He wants anything and everything and gets it, no matter what.  Then, as Scorsese's subjects always do, must suffer for it.  Jordan races through life as fast as he can, acquiring anything and everything he can get his hands on.  Anything?  How about his own yacht with a helipad?  Of course, you'll need a helicopter to go along with it.\n\nLike Goodfellas, which followed the personal real-life story of an outsider into the world of New York gangsters, The Wolf of Wall Street follows the rise and fall of Jordan Belfort, who narrates his own story with the energy of a runaway bullet train.  At 22, he is a nice kid from the middle class who gets a job with a legendary Wall Street firm L.J. Rothchild under the tutelage of Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey) a wiry drug-addict who not only trains the kid, but lets him in on the secrets of quick success.  \"The name of the game,\" he tells Jordan,\" is moving the money from the client's pocket to your pocket.\"  This is a mantra that Jordan takes to heart, even if the client doesn't make a dime.\n\nThen, only weeks after getting the job, Rothchild hits a brick wall on October 19th, 1987 - Black Monday - forcing the grand old lady to close its doors after 90 years.  Without a job, he starts from the bottom at the only firm that will hire him - a meager penny-stock firm that works out of an auto parts garage.  Jordan makes himself a superstar by proving how easy it is to scam the client to make money fast.  He takes over the business, building it from penny stocks to Blue Chips to IPOs born on the backs of screwing their clients.  To his surprise, he finds a small patch of money hungry brokers ready to follow his lead.  Most visible is a pudgy Jewish kid named Donnie (Jonah Hill) who becomes his right arm. Donnie is a glutinous yin to Jordan's yang, an otherwise nice Jewish kid who tries to throw off that moniker by dressing as WASP-like as he can.\n\nIn no time Jordan has turned the tiny boiler room brokerage firm into Stratton Oakmont, an operation built on crooked investments from which flows money, money, money leading to mountains of drugs, rooms full of naked women, and every expensive toy under the sun.  He feels guilty about nothing, taking Gordon Gekko's mantra of \"Greed is Good\" and making it into a religious sacrament.  Jordan is a modern-day Caligula, a Roman Emperor who makes no apologies for his gross avarice, his drug addiction, his sex addiction or any other morally reprehensible machination that allowed him to get it.  In no time at all he has be biggest house, the biggest boat, the best sports car, the fastest plane, and mounds and mounds of drugs.  He even trades in his supportive wife (\"How I Met Your Mother\"'s Cristin Milioti) for a gorgeous blonde trophy wife (Naomi Robbie).\n\nIn our minds, possibly not to Jordan, there is always the dread that the party will come to an end.  We feel that, but Jordan constantly skirts disaster, especially late in the film when he desperately needs to get to Switzerland and takes his own boat instead of a plane.  The plane explodes in mid-air and Jordan comes to believe that he may be invincible.  We feel that too, even when a boy scout FBI agent (Kyle Chandler) start snooping around Jordan's books.  The scene at sea, incidentally, is a not-so-thinly veiled call-back to DiCaprio's role in Titanic when his boat is caught in a violent storm and it looks like The King of the World won't make it out of this one either.\n\nThe rhythm of the film is familiar to anyone who has seen Scorsese's films before, what is amazing is that it's always infectious.  We know that what Jordan and Donnie are doing is morally reprehensible, but there is something in the attractiveness of their behavior that makes us privately hope that they won't get caught.  In our own way we like these guys, and that may come from our familiarity with their other films.  DiCaprio, in particular, turns in his very best performance, throwing away his good-guy image as a man who lives by appetite alone.  There are notes here that DiCaprio has never been able to display.  Yes, he's good looking, but he isn't afraid to look like a jerk.  Here he is able to display his talent for slapstick in a scene in which Jordan ingests a 15 year-old Quaalude that sends his body into a fit very close to cerebral palsy.  That's no good when he desperately needs to get to his car to stop Donnie from making a fatal mistake.  What is surprising is that this scene is played for laughs and it works!\n\nThis is a movie made up of two or three dozen perfect moments like that.  Overall it's energy is charged by the pacing and by DiCaprio's in-your-face narration.  This is a raunchy, messy, but ultimately exciting film about one guy who desires everything and gets it.  If it seems a bit too long, that's only because it is playing to the theme of wretched excess.  The end of the film sends Jordan on a toboggan slide that seems somewhat inevitable, causing his reign as king of the world to end with a whimper instead of a bang.  Does he learn a lesson from all his sins of lust and greed?  What do you think?",

You can't believe all this happened, but it looks brilliant. 1987, and Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) becomes a stockbroker working for Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey), after Black Monday, Belfort is out of work, but he starts his own company, Stratton Oakmont, out of an abandoned garage, selling penny stocks for outrageously inflated prices. It makes him and business partner Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) millions in the space of a few years, and they lead an extravagant lifestyle, consisting of sex, booze and Quaaludes. But, it's not long before their activities catch the attention of FBI agent Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler), who starts investigating, and Belfort and Azoff have to find a way to hide their millions. There's some scenes here you cannot believe Scorsese would have his cast doing, but it makes for fascinating and entertaining viewing, DiCaprio gives maybe his best performance, this shows that he should stop doing serious, brooding roles and do more comedy, he has a brilliant talent for it.

Debauchery and corruption, irreverently portrayed in this movie, were commonplace elements in the real life of this man while he conned his way into fortune. I haven't seen a Scorcese film in a long time, and yet \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" turned up to match exactly the only expectation I had - a movie that entertains and engages effortlessly by way of the trademark cinematic quality and vitality of Scorcese, but also seems to be a residuum of redundancy since, in many ways, this is a similar work to past outputs like \"Goodfellas\", for example. Was there any need to make a movie with such potentially contemptuous portray of debauchery? Maybe Scorcese thought so because otherwise it would be much more difficult to deviate the viewer's attention away from the fact that this is just more of the same. The same narrative concept, the same energy and aesthetics while we follow the rise and fall of the main characters (or group of main characters) connected to a criminal activity, the only differences are the thematic context and tone. The truth is, so much debauchery makes the movie a bit too long and slightly boring. What's so interesting about it?\r\n\r\nBut redundant or not, \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" is one more example of Scorcese's fine cinematic craft, technically perfect, very well polished, exciting and funny, with rock solid acting all around, I particularly liked DiCaprio and Jonah Hill. After watching this epic portrayal of Belfort's life of excess, one might have the natural tendency to look for an explanation or meaning behind all that, but I think that the main premiss of this work is to serve as an engaging and funny cinematic experience a bit like \"American Hustle\". I think these two movies have relatively similar premisses, but David O. Russel's effort, itself with an imprint of Scorcese DNA, is a sexier, more organic, funnier and more appealing cinematic experience to me. I guess it's a matter of taste that will dictate which movie one likes the most.",

I totally respect the great Scorcese, but this movie is nothing but wall street stockbrokers doing  whatever they can to make money, taking every drug they can, trying to sound tough by unnaturally using the \"F\" word before every sentence, objectifying women, and having no personalities of their own, all worshipping the so called \"wolf of wall street\" Jordan Belfort. I know it's based on a true story, and it's supposed to just be an honest portrayal, but it seems to try to overdo and dramatize the wild lifestyle and illegal dealings of Belfort and his band of brokers.  I get from the portrayal that there is no good side to Belfort, and we really have no explanation of his actions except that he loves money and power (compare this to Christian Bale's character in \"American Hustle.\" At times he is likeable.) Maybe we are to assume that that's just the way he is.  Anyway, I found it a waste of 2 hours.  Scorcese's still the best, but I don't think he tried when he made this one.",

The film became infamous stateside due to controversy with the film being allegedly accountable for condoning/glamourising pugnacious behaviour and also for it's drug material. The overall tone of the film does not exactly promote the lifestyle of these characters who are so cartoonish they verge on being caricatures. 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is an intense film experience and it's always a delight to watch the film's leading ex-conman, Jordon Belfort (DiCaprio)'s depraved and repulsive antics, DiCaprio's screen presence is strong and his ability to carry the weight of the film on his shoulders shines through. Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) portrays Belfort's sidekick (if you will) gives justice to the supporting role. It's not long until Belfort's circle of greed expands among itself, with the FBI latching onto his master scheme with Belfort's contribution, it's long until the game is up which marks his demise of a lifestyle destined to result in jeopardy. Now, story wise, it's somewhat lacking, but if you can manage to get past that and relish some of the amazing set pieces and rowdy characters, the three hour run time will fly by. It's a film that's either loved or hated, rarely in-between. You'll either laugh, shake your head or frown upon the excessive unruly content, perhaps maybe all three at the same time! It's an unrelenting ride of hilarity and pure chaos from beginning to end. Scorsese on near top form, it's one you'll treasure for years to come.",

Instead of focusing on the enormity of Belfort's crimes, Scorcese really does come close to near-deifying the guy in an attempt to give DiCaprio another vehicle to shine in. 4/5 But outside of all that sanctimonious finger wagging, I fucking loved this fucking movie and I'd love to fucking watch it again.

            "content": "This is a movie that has created a lot of hype and I was very excited to see it; mostly because it's got Leonardo Dicaprio and I heard that he played a character unlike any he has before. Not only does Wolf of Wallstreet showcase the heights of Dicaprio's performance, but it delivers one of the best movies of 2013 with a brilliantly written script and oscar winning (sorry Leo) performances. There's just so much to talk about.\nLet me start off with the story; its an autobiography of the rise and fall of a stockbroker, Jordan Belfort played by Dicaprio. The story is well paced, smart and has a near perfect balance of humour, drama and suspense. This of course is complimented by the very well written script which makes it witty but also allows a lot of the best moments of the story to be taken from the actors' performances but i'll get to that later. For its lengthy two hour and fifty five minute run, I was never bored. I was entertained from start to finish and that's not a feat a lot of movies can accomplish. The script and acting just fluidly meshed together, creating an experience I was just captivated by. In fact, I was a bit worried about the length but as I was watching I completely forgot about checking to see how long the movie had left as I was so engrossed in what was going on. There are themes of love, sex, betrayal, friendship and drugs; they all compliment the satisfying story and helped to keep the tension.\nIn terms of performances, let's just get this out of the way; DiCaprio is amazing. This is a character unlike anything I've ever seen him play and he does it so well, it's scary. His enthusiasm, his anger, and the ability to portray such an unstable drug addict is something to behold. He's funny and charming for five minutes then he just switches to aggressive and pig headed and then switches to kind, caring and loving, all the while he's narrating. He showcased so many different emotions in this film that it's hard to say that he's not capable of anything. In fact, I feel as if the oscars are beneath him as there should be a higher award given for his performance. Jonah's performance as his right hand man is also great and they have great chemistry on screen with a lot of the humour coming from them. Speaking of humour; Dicaprio debases himself a lot during this movie; there's this one scene where he's high and he's practically crawling to his car that had me rolling. His level of commitment is just ridiculous because there was no music or dialogue except him rolling and making strange movements to try to get the car door open and it was one of the funniest scenes I have ever seen. There are also a lot of nude scenes for him, but I suppose the ladies would enjoy that. Speaking of which, this movie really approaches the borderline of a porno. There was so much sex and nudity involved, it's ridiculous, which so helped to compliment the themes of power and money. I imagine that this would also shun away certain portions of the audience which is understandable as I don't think i've ever seen a movie that has been so raunchy and vulgar in a very long time. I mean, in the first five minutes, Dicaprio is sniffing cocaine out of a hooker's back-passage. Scintillating stuff. So much thought was put into translating the book to the screen that the director should also be praised for his accomplishment.\nMost characters are memorable with their quirks and there was no weak acting; this is some top notch stuff. Even near the end, where there's a girl that was never mentioned in the entire story but was brought up as one of Belfort's first assistants forks out an emotional story which is heartbreaking. The movie just does this all very well; manages to keep all the characters interesting, no matter how little screen time they got. This, of course, was also the movie's flaw; they tried to introduce too much characters; so much that they could not keep up with each one and their various resolutions were unsatisfying. This is a minor gripe though, as the ambition of the movie can be appreciated. However, its the metamorphosis of Belfort that manages to carry the story from start to finish and it's so filling that you won't know or even realize that you missed anything else.\nWith the performance of a lifetime given by Dicaprio, a brilliant script and well paced movie with great performances from start to finish, there's no reason NOT to watch Wolf of Wallstreet. Sell me this pen. 9.5/10",

There were some unique shots throughout that are kind of typical of Scorsese style. Well its hard to be like this movie was awesome b/c it was about a huge d-bag and how easy he got off from wrong-doings-doesn't exactly leave u feeling all warm and fuzzy inside. Also, I thought the movie was rather overdrawn in some sequences (we get it constant hookers/sluts/drugs) and too short in others that were important(how he got clean, how he scammed ppl, his jail term)... To me I know it's supposed to be a cautionary tale, but by constantly showing those scenes glamorized and funny, it's like it's reveling in the glory of being a greedy asshole versus the consequences. It didn't send home the message properly which I think was that these guys get off easy because of problems in our justice system with punishment of white-collar crimes and its bad. More like the director made it seem fun to be bad and that the fbi were just sticklers and narks, not the right tone. I really didn't care for the main characters, in fact I find it hard not to loathe them and it really exemplifies the worst parts of America I think and gives a bad impression about stock brokers (who I'm sure aren't all this evil...I hope). He was pretty much like a white-collar mafioso big shot who was the biggest misogynist. He lived life ridic. in greed as tho he was invincible no matter who he hurt (clients, his wives, kids, friends, coworkers) he degraded women and small people, acted immature, did drugs, was rude to people on streets, completely unprofessional, etc... I don't know how ppl could be his friend, work for him, let alone marry him! If I ever become nearly as greedy or immoral I would really need to take stock in my own life and I'm not perfect but come on. In the long run though, I think he will get his own karma.Terrible part of movie is its based on a true story! That's why I think this story is important even if it wasn't told the best.",

            "content": "The fifth collaboration between Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio, The Wolf of Wall Street tells the true story of the rise and fall of Jordan Belfort (DiCaprio), a New York stockbroker who made it big in the wake of the financial crisis of the late '80s by shady and frequently illegal means. More interesting is what he does with his new found fortune: what follows is a heady tale of excess and debauchery based on Belfort's own memoirs.\n\nDespite the more recent financial turmoil, or perhaps because of it, the image of the '80s stockbroker has resurfaced for a new generation. Belfort's story strays into the early '90s, but the general aesthetic of the era has the same nostalgic feel, and the messages seem to be the same. Even if we openly loathe bankers, there's a voyeuristic fascination in watching their decadent lifestyle - or what we imagine such a lifestyle to be like: high stress, fast living, dubious morality and plenty of drugs and sex to boot. The Wolf of Wall Street gives its audience a welcome window into this world.\n\nThe story begins when Jordan arrives in the city as a bright eyed, newly qualified broker; having already achieved his youthful dream of working on Wall Street. After an initially unwelcome brief induction into a life of cocaine and lunchtime cocktails by his new boss Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey) the rug is pulled out from under his feet, and he soon swaps blue chips for penny stocks, trading shares worth a fraction of a dollar from a Long Island brokerage on a strip mall.\n\nUpon realising that these unlisted stocks can fetch a much higher commission than blue chips, he decides to go into business with a bunch of unscrupulous buddies who know a thing or two about sales, using their silver tongues to make millions by trading them on a massive scale, all the while trying to stay one step ahead of the law. For in truth he is committing outright stock fraud - the details of which are fairly complicated; even Belfort himself chooses not to bore us with the details with his tongue in cheek narration.\n\nThe stellar cast is rounded out by players including Jonah Hill, as Belfort's toothy associate Donnie, Rob Reiner as his complicit accountant father Max Belfort, and Jon Favreau as lawyer Manny Riskin.\n\nThe movie treads a thin line between satire and glorification, but Jordan is undoubtedly the hero of the piece, and the FBI agents on his trail the antagonists he must outwit. As an audience, we are invited to his party, and we witness nothing of the effects that Belfort's deceptions have had on those who were duped into buying his shares - bearing in mind these 'customers' are average people parting with their savings, not huge companies dealing in huge sums of money. This disconnection effectively puts us in Belfort's shoes: much as they must have appeared to him, they are mere voices on the end of a phone.\n\nBut Jordan is not portrayed as completely heartless. No matter how large his company grows, swelled with a never-ending number of skilled and promising applicants, his loyal gang of hometown reprobates are never left behind, and maintain high-ranking positions until the end. Even when arrested, and forced to wear a wire by the FBI, he attempts to warn Donnie, rather than let him incriminate himself.\n\nGratuitous drug use and sexual content aside, the film's vulgarity can perhaps be summed up by its smashing of the record for the most uses of the f-word in a mainstream non-documentary film, at the rate of around three a minute. The only film scoring higher is a documentary devoted to the word.\n\nMuch of the decadence is played for laughs, or at least as a showcase of extravagance, but coupled with the basic shock value of the actions themselves. One memorable sequence sees Belfort snorting cocaine to counteract the effects of a powerful sedative, paralleled with the Popeye cartoon playing on the television in the background.\n\nThe film does little to condemn Belfort - although his lifestyle unravels, and he is ultimately incarcerated, any true comeuppance is minimal. This is a reflection of the truth: Belfort's sentence was just four years, of which he served less than two, which, if the film is to be believed, were in a comfortable minimum security environment for white collar offenders.\n\nThese days, he still makes a handsome living as a motivational speaker lecturing on sales technique, and of course, anyone who gets their autobiography made into a Scorsese picture starring Leonardo DiCaprio must have lucked out in the long run.",

            "content": "Martin Scorsese is known for his lavish, over-the-top film extravaganzas just as much as he is for his gritty, \"real\" projects. 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is definitely in the former camp. The big budget, bloated look at the life of Wall Street conman Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) tests the boundaries with its content, as the three-hour piece is chock-full of sex, drugs, language and general debauchery - a true portrait of life on Wall Street in the 1990s. While the runtime is extreme, 'Wolf' doesn't feel as long as it is, considering all of the action packed in. 'Wolf' is the definition of a dark comedy - as the greed, sadness and roller coaster ride of Belfort's life includes plenty of parts that are cruelly ironic but funny to a point. Among the rest of the cast, Jonah Hill as Belfort's cohort Donnie Azoff, Margot Robbie as his second wife Naomi Lapaglia and Kyle Chandler as FBI agent Patrick Denham do respectable jobs, and a minor role by Matthew McConaughey is appreciated. Things that stand out about 'Wolf' include its editing - perhaps a strange aspect to highlight, but it's noticeable in this instance - and its soundtrack, which is very fitting. While there was plenty of controversy upon the release of the film for glorifying the life of Belfort, it's fair to say there's not a whole lot of glamor here, even if it appears so on the surface. 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is loud, obnoxious, witty and wild - it's not Scorsese's best work, nor is it his worst. It's a film worth watching just once in your life, to say you've seen it, but not much beyond that.",

I don't think we've ever seen greed, excess and all-around insanity portrayed on film quite like this before.  This flick holds absolutely nothing back.  Collaborating with Leonardo DiCaprio for a fifth time, Scorsese really brings out the best in one of this generation's more versatile actors.  Who the hell knew DiCaprio could be this funny?  Just as impressive is Jonah Hill, who gets to play an actual character here instead of yet another variation on his 'Superbad' role.  Scorsese throws more sex, drugs and profanity at the screen here than in all his other films combined.  Some will be in on the joke...others won't and will probably hate this movie.  For me, the only thing that kept this from being one of Scorsese's best was the length.  At three hours long they could've easily cut 20-30 minutes to keep the pace tighter and the film wouldn't have lost any of its punch.  Definitely not for everyone, but worth seeing for the brilliant performances.  And just keep telling yourself...this is a true story.",

Rothschild (Matthew McConaughey in a stellar brief key role that sets the tone for the whole movie), who lives high with a lot of casual sex and drugs until going to prison when firm goes bankrupt, shapes Belfort's future. After losing his job, he sells penny stocks at a small Long Island business and excels, leading him to start his own business with his salesman neighbor Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) that he names \"Stratton Oakmont\". The firm soon becomes the talk of the town and known for its employees' decadent lifestyle of sex and drugs. And we get a lot of it here. I have no problem with scenes of sexuality or nudity but here there is one too many to basically convey the same message so at some point it feels utterly redundant.  Cast includes Margot Robbie (in a breakout role) as Belfort's trophy second wife, Kyle Chandler as the FBI agent investigating Belfort and Jean Dujardin as a corrupt Swiss banker who helps Belfort get money out of the US. \n\nI must say I thoroughly enjoyed the first half of this dark comedy that had a proper mix of raunchiness and entertainment with an over-the-top (in a good way) performance by DiCaprio. But it just feels a bit repetitive after some time and loses some of its initial interest when the FBI gets into the picture. This could have easily been a two-hour movie (it is surprising that the initial running time was nearly 30-45 minutes longer!). As an example, there is one scene where DiCaprio and Hill get a huge dose of some old strong drug with DiCaprio having to drive stoned to a country club to call a private investigator and then returns home to find Hill run amok under the influence. While the acting is great, it is just far too long.  \n\nThere is a lot to admire about the movie and it is well worth watching if only for DiCaprio and some outrageous scenes (some of which are mouth-opening) but I am just disappointed as it could have been so much better given the talent involved. Adapted to the screen by Terence Winter (TV's \"The Sopranos\" and \"Boardwalk Empire\"). Nominated for 5 Oscars: Picture, Director, Actor (DiCaprio), Supporting Actor (Hill), Adapted Screenplay.",

            "content": "As much as I loathe Kanye West, I couldn't help but be pulled into the preview for this film, pulsating to the beat of his ever-so-tacky \"Black Skinhead\".  Add to it that Martin Scorsese (Hugo) directed this gig, and I almost wanted to see it in theaters.  I opted not to, because Oscar movies generally disappoint me.  However, when I finally saw it on Blu-ray, not only was I disappointed, I was borderline disgusted.  It's no secret that \nLeonardo DiCaprio (The Great Gatsby) is Scorsese's go-to boy for just about anything.  However, despite DiCaprio not really being able to pull off something non-crazy (exceptions: 'Inception' and 'The Departed'), Scorsese usually pieces together a decent film.  With this one, they both went for broke and the results were atrocious.  So many things to pick apart that I'm not even going to begin to.  The cast is stacked with talent - Matthew McConaughey (Mud), Kyle Chandler (Broken City), Rob Reiner (Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star), Jon Favreau (Iron Man 3), and  Jean Dujardin (The Artist) - but instead of lingering on those brief shining moments, it spends more time following DiCaprio and Jonah Hill's (This is the End) characters' drug-fueled sexual exploits than creating a film that you could even begin to care about.  Margot Robbie (About Time) leads a host of tramps that are on screen for no other reason than to shed their clothes.  There is not one redeeming quality about this film, and by the end, you're hoping someone dies in an epic way so as to almost justify three hours of your time being wasted.  Spoiler alert: no such payoff exists.  In fact, there is no real payoff at all.  It's a complete waste.  Sure, Leo goes bonkers and got another Oscar nomination, but to what end?  He'll never achieve greatness by basically playing varying degrees of the same character over and over again.  Hill also landed another nomination, but he's equally as Kirk Lazarus (if you get that joke, I give you props) in his role.  Honestly, what I'm most disappointed in - other than wasting three hours of my life on this mess - is Scorsese.  What a waste of talent on this piece of garbage.  Should have known it was going to be tacky and awful just by having Kanye as part of their marketing effort.",

There were just so many scenes that just had me laughing for minutes at a time even after the fact, which that by the time I was finished laughing, more hilarious scenes were added. Leo also did an amazing performance as the narrator of the movie to the point where he goes on to say \" Hell...what the hell am I even saying I'm probably boring you do death with all this. My point is: Was this shit illegal? Hell fucking yes.\" Based on a true story apparently, it was just brilliantly acted and directed.

It's like \"American Hustle\" because it takes two reputable actors (Hill and DiCaprio) and makes them very unlikable. It takes the run time from \"Casino\". And, the ending is basically copy-paste from \"Goodfellas\". There are some generally funny moments, but in the end, it boils down to a lot of sex, the F word, and drugs for 3 hours. And yes I get it, they're all criminals, but this is almost taking it too far. It's as if the film is just throwing F bombs, and boobs at the screen to see what gets a laugh out of you, and that is just juvenile from a director of this stature. I am glad I saw the film and gave it a try, but, that being said I found it very drawn out and would not consider watching it again. I love you Scorsese, I really really do, and I understand that every director is entitled to one \"dud film\". \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" is that dud for me.",

Many people seem to be shying away from the film because of the controversy surrounding it, including the accusation that it glorifies amoral behavior. What those people fail to realize is, that's the point; the film is portraying that lifestyle and we are supposed to be shocked by it.\nAnd Shocked I was by the film, which was unbelievably raunchy and coarse. I was totally swept up by the film, laughing my head off constantly. The performances, especially DiCaprio and Hill's are phenomenal and add to the energy of the film. \nAnother reason  people will shy away from Wolf is because of it's length, but the film moves remarkably fast and keeps you engaged the whole time. This is due in large part to Scorsese's direction, which is flawless and exhilarating; he's able to create a frenzied pace that is undeniable.  So ignore the controversy and forget worrying about the length; The Wolf of Wall Street is a must see and one of the best films in recent memory.",

            "content": "This might be, arguably, Leonardo DiCaprio's best performance yet.  Yes, I know what you're thinking: \"In a career full of incredible performances, how do you single out just one as someone's best?\"  That's a great question, and one that I really can't answer.  But Leonardo DiCaprio, as he is wont to do, hits a grand slam with his performance here.  The main difference is that, as opposed to his other performances, he seems to be having a blast here.  It seems like he really got to let loose and probably have more fun on set than he probably has been allowed to before.  I'm not saying that he doesn't have fun acting, but in this film it was even more apparent.  And it certainly benefits the character he's playing and the story the film is telling.  This a story about all the excesses, all the depravity, debauchery, the drugs, the sex, etc, etc, etc.  It's all here, just when you think the film can't get any crazier with its depravity, they up the ante.  The film, it could be argued, glorifies Jordan's actions and that's certainly a valid point.  My response to that, however, is that to show Jordan at the lowest of lows you have to show him getting to the highest of highs.  Not unlike another Scorsese film, GoodFellas.  So in that regards, I think the film is successful.  Because, in both movies, no matter how great things were for Jordan at his highest, there's only one place to go at your highest...and that's down.  And that's exactly what happened.  It would be glorifying his actions if, at the end of the day, he did all this illegal shit and didn't pay for it in the eyes of the law.  That's when people can go and say \"well if he did it, then I can.\"  The fact of the matter is that while, yes, he made millions and millions of dollars doing highly illegal shit, eventually he had to pay for it all.  I think that's really the point of the film.  All the excesses, all the partying, all that debauchery eventually caught up to Jordan, and by extension his company, and bit him in the ass.  With that said, the film is actually surprisingly funny, and it even has one of the funniest scenes of any film last year.  It's certainly got a very irreverent sense of humor.  So, if you're someone that gets easily upset over stupid shit, then this film's gonna drive you nuts.  But, that irreverent humor definitely was very entertaining and made what is an interminably long film, even though it doesn't feel like it, really easy and entertaining to watch.  What I thought about Jordan Belfort as a character is that he was a man who was willing to do anything, white-collar crime related, to get to where he wanted to be and that was to be a millionaire.  And the way he did so wasn't even through his own intelligence.  He didn't do this because he was the smartest, he did this because he was the shrewdest and he knew how to con/manipulate people into buying penny stocks for companies that aren't gonna go far.  He knew how to use his clients to get exactly what he needed, and he knew how to manipulate the system in his favor.  Another thing that's very noticeable about Jordan is that he had this weird charisma and way of motivating his employees to do just about absolutely anything for him.  He was definitely a great motivational speaker, if this film is any indication.  He could motivate any of his employees to give his mother cyanide and convince them that it's actually good for her.  Granted, things never got THAT far, though I'm sure that the real Jordan Belfort certainly embellished a lot.of his escapades.  But there's something about Jordan and his motley crew that sort of made me think that they were the Manson Family of Wall Street.  Of course, they wouldn't go to the extremes the Mansons did, but Jordan's employee would do absolutely anything and everything for him, so there's some weird cult leader thing going on with Jordan.  It's certainly not overt, but you can notice it.  The movie, as usual, is exquisitely shot as Scorsese is at the top of his game as a director.  I think the film could've used some trimming here and there, but all in all, the film is an easy 179 minutes to watch.  The humorous tone certainly helped a lot, and Leonardo DiCaprio and cast were clearly having a blast.  So this is a pretty damn great film if you ask me.  If you're, somehow, offended at the behavior the film portrays...then good, because that's the intention.  Great film and a testament to Scorsese's strength  and diversity as a filmmaker that he can go and do all these different projects when he could very easily do GoodFellas, or The Departed, over and over and over again.",

Probably that's why my expectations were set up very high. I cannot say that I didn't like it, but I found out that during the very long (almost 3) hours I wasn't too excited by the screenplay written by Terence Winter. The stars were on much higher level, especially Leonardo DiCaprio as Jordan Belfort, a New York stockbroker who runs a firm that engages in securities fraud and corruption on Wall Street in the 1990s.\r\n\r\nThe film has a real stardom with Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Matthew McConaughey, Kyle Chandler, Rob Reiner, Jon Bernthal, Jon Favreau, and Jean Dujardin. It is the fifth collaboration between Scorsese and DiCaprio and it is obvious that they like each other's style of work.  \r\n\r\nThis film was mainly criticized for its moral ambiguity, sexual content, presence of drugs, vulgarity, and use of animals - but still managed to gross over $387 million worldwide against a $100 million budget, and was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor for DiCaprio and Hill respectively, but failed to win in any category. It was the first major film to be distributed entirely digitally. The film also holds the record for the most uses of the word \"fuck\" in a mainstream non-documentary film (it was almost impossible to beat the South Park movie, but these guys did it with  doubling the time when you can use those words) . In January 2014 Jonah Hill revealed in an interview with Howard Stern that he only made $60,000 the film while his co-star, Leonardo DiCaprio who also produced, received $10 million. Hill was determined to work with Scorsese, and wanted to play Donnie Azoff so badly that he was willing to do what it took to get the part.\r\n\r\nI had a problem with being interested in characters who are interesting only when they were high - and that interest was in their heads only, because I do not think that the victims of these guys were so enthusiastic in financial dealings as they were. Not a bad movie, acting and directing were very good, but it had its own flows, especially regarding the screenplay and to be believable!",

It makes Eyes Wide Shut look like Barney the dinosaur. It has multiple NC-17 style sex scenes and more f-words than any movie to date. The main character is obsessed with his own hubris and the desire for more and more wealth. He screws people out of their money on Wall Street and shows no real love for anyone, only using them to fulfill his hedonistic lifestyle. The movie is a black comedy, and is quite hilarious at times, especially in a scene of a quaalude binge gone bad. I also felt the movie to be quite relevant. Given our sinful nature as humans, we are all prone to selfishness and the pursuit of our own happiness and ideals, even at the expense of others. Our consumer culture feeds the idea that we need to have more stuff, that our happiness is more important than anything, and that making a ton of money will fulfill that desire to be happy. Make more, spend more, get, get, get. The Wolf of Wall Street illustrates what happens when someone completely gives into that greedy, hedonistic lifestyle, living only to make more, have more, and feel pleasure at all times and at all costs. The result: self destruction. I thought The Wolf of Wall Street was an excellent movie. It made me laugh, it made me cringe, but it also made me take a good look at my life, values, and relationships. The hubris and downfall of Jordan Belfort reminds me of what's really important in life; not getting rich or taking from others, but loving and giving to those whom I love.",

This takes the fun and films, and does not forget his best tricks, but unfortunately it comes down to partying film\n\nOne surprise is Jonah Hill, who ceases to be an anti-social to get a role in part matches with their popular nerd roles, but now acting as more adult than his age (at the beginning, he dresses and acts like an old man) and sloppily. It adds to the character of Belfort when presented the opportunity and has its good moments. In addition, DiCaprio is a all-road that may lose a bit of charm than \"Django Unchained\" (where was the villain) but it fits any type of situation and he is quite funny in a comedy. Also the brief appearance of Matthew McConaughey is a downer for its short duration and is strange compared to the excellent performance of \"Killer Joe\". In this film McConaughey seems gesturing a little more, though undoubtedly he deserved a longer duration\n\nThe case of Jordan Belfort is undoubtedly particular, but belongs to the echoes of the maelstrom of Wall Street in the '80s, where President Reagan supported these frivolous trends (Have you seen the photo of the president with Frank Sinatra, or Michael Jackson?) while claiming a heavy materialism and conservative values. The next film makes it look Belfort as an illegal version of Donald Trump, and a politically correct film than \"American Psycho\". In this universe, a moderately agile person could handle, sell junk and make millions, which is what happens in \"The Wolf Of Wall Street\"\n\nThe film promises to narrate the rise and fall of this tycoon. Frankly, perhaps the best definition gave Matt Seitz (in his page \"Roger Ebert\"): \"Imagine the last thirty minutes of Goodfellas stretched out to three hours\" That is the virtue and the defect . Here Scorsese portrays Belfort with the charisma as which the director did their other productions, and providing a small group of gang. In the movie, Leonardo Di Caprio achieved (based on skillful leadership ) triumph over their poor and mediocre fellows, and then drag them to the same ball, getting an army of loyal followers that operate in the same way that he and live like him.\n\nThings work when approaching steps humor: all are eminently likeable, without annoying pretensions or ego swelling. There are excesses, but are not very visual, and in the background the protagonists are just a couple of dumbs but now with money and drugs and certain level of sophistication , so the comedy gears work great: just look at DiCaprio down stairs like babies (as he says) because the drugs do not allow him to walk, or in an exchange of thoughts with the owner of Swiss bank or one of the aunts of his girlfriend. Add up the directorial style with Off vooice, talking to the camera in an accomplice tone, collations of time, information, monologues, moderately competent soundtrack, etc. that add a touch on the mood or the general line\n\nWhile the film does not exactly qualify comedy but contains enough and kill you with laughter, on the other hand \"The Wolf Of Wall Street\" does not offer much more than that\n\n\nThis review continues on my personal Tumblr, which has no commercial purpose now\n\nhttp://reviewsandthecity.tumblr.com/post/73029171172/the-wolf-of-wall-street-film-review",

The movie has been nominated for Oscar in at least 5 categories including Best Film, Best Director (Martin Scorsese) and Best Leading Actor (Leonardo DiCaprio as Jordan Belfort, a New York stock broker).\nThe story is based on a book, which is true. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Jordan Belfort (as I write earlier), a man who made a lot of money hustling illegal financial deals. He worked hard and played full of tricks: copious drugs, profuse sex and unlimited arrogance. The action takes place In Wall Street like In title.\nThe movie is criticized by many people to have too much sex, drugs abuse and vulgarity. In my opinion, it is done extremely well and is thought provoking. A bit too long though.",

Its equivocation of the capitalist American dream with a testosterone-fueled orgy of masculinity proves quite brilliant.  A hilarious, yet dark film, The Wolf of Wall Street does not feature a single respectable character--they are all scum, ready and willing to sell themselves and those around them to the highest bidder.  \n\nWolf of Wall Street is about seeing life as a cost-benefit analysis without any regard to ethics or repercussions.  It follows the typical Scorsese arc of rise and fall along with the inevitable voice-over, but the subject-matter and the tone of the film are different enough to make this not feel derivative of his earlier works.  Here, Scorsese is working at the edge of drama and often spilling over into satire, and it is a damn funny film.  But one that also makes one slightly uneasy about the consequences of our laughter.",

Performance wise this movie is great. Leonardo DiCaprio, Jonah Hill and everyone in the cast is great. I believed everyone's performance. But with those performances there isn't really any character development. We get practically no character development with Gordon's wife, and before you ask which one I'm talking about both of them. The second wife had potential to have a lot of character development, but we get none. In the end scene we are suppose to feel bad for her but I don't. Now the problem most people have is the length. I thought I was not going to have a problem with the length but I did. A lot of this movie could have been cut off. All of the sex scenes were unnecessary. Bringing me to my other problem, too much sex and nudity. I'm not the one to complain when there is sex or nudity in a movie. But this over did it. To the point where I felt uncomfortable watching it. I wasn't bored in a lot of parts watching this. I was bored in other parts when the movie slows down. I was invested in the story, but that would break off when they show nudity and sex. The sex scenes could be cut off completely; there is no use for them at all. I did laugh in a lot of parts that made up for the boring parts. But the biggest flaw of the movie is the length. And I'm going to keep on complaining. It does not have to be three hours long. I really did want to love this movie. I wanted it to be in my top three movies of the year. But I didn't love it, I liked it. The movie was fine; I would recommend it to a lot of people. But I wanted to like this more than American Hustle, but I ended up liking American Hustle more. Would I still put this in my best movies of 2013? Probably, but I don't think it would be as high as I wanted it to. Maybe I need to see it again. I'll probably buy it on Blu-Ray. What a letdown.",

So, like many previous Scorsese films, we have a tale of the life arch of another psychopath.  The parallels between Henry Hill in GoodFellas and Belfort in Wolf are uncanny.  But while GoodFellas has something human about it all...this movie doesn't.  A glimpse into the sick word of these type of people is entertaining in a voyeuristic way but I left the film feeling a bit irritated.  Thinking on how DiCaprio and Scorese portray their efforts to make this film as some sort of crusade, I found myself thinking, \"did we really need another movie glorifying the escapades of another flaming narcissist/psychopath? \" Compared to GoodFellas, this story lacks any human quality.  There is no one in the film with qualities that are worthy of rooting for...or makes them the least bit likable.

The movie is way too long for this kind of genre and even though Scorsese is known for his long-winded movies, it actually hurt the movie this time around.

It is a thrill ride following the life of a drug-riddled, workaholic, money-driven sex-fiend, and it is such a relief to watch, as it doesn't take itself too seriously and takes you out on a captivating date.

All the elements of Scorsese are here;  We have a New York backdrop, we have a protagonist with moral ambiguity at best, and we have the invisible wall broken between audience and characters, as Belfort talks to us directly throughout the film.  Further, we get an inside look, a glimpse, into an underworld unfamiliar to most.  We say \"I can't believe I just saw that\", and we are fascinated with the sex, the drugs, the violence, and the crime, as we sit, safely in our voyeuristic theater seats, enjoying the spectacle.  These are all classic Scorsese elements, and I loved every bit of them.  Wolf parallels Casino, in many ways for me, in terms of how Scorsese tells his story, and how we respond.  In addition, We have an amazing cast of actors, DiCaprio and McConaughey of many, but of course, the big surprise here was the performance of Jonah Hill, who continues to amaze us as as his craft develops and hones.  I'm not sure if the high point was the prosthetic penis, or the incredulous Ludes overdose at the country club.  Indeed, Wolf was highly entertaining, I was pleased they did not edit the film down to a vanilla size, running close to 3 hours, and I will watch it again and savor all of its gritty insane Wall Street moments. My only small critique would be this:   I was left wondering if just a little bit of meat could have been added on to the bones of the \"pump and dump\", which is primarily the fraud that was committed here:  In other words, the operators, owned shares of their chop stocks, then sold over inflated shares to investors, then dumped their own shares, and thus, riches were made.  I'll have to watch Wolf a second time around to see if this was fully explained to us, or if it was glossed over.  It might be an 'in the weeds' detail that many folks would care less to know, but an important one in my view.  That said, there was plenty of bad to go around here, and I don't think the idea that Belfort was essentially a bad guy, but a guy that we care about, was lost to us.  Final critique, I wished we had a little more of an epilogue beyond the pen sales seminar in New Zealand.  Not so much with regard to Belfort.  The end of his tale, is morally ambiguous, and that is appropriate.  Did he change?  Did he learn from his mistakes?  Maybe not.  But, I'm left wondering about his wife, whom he punched in the gut, his daughter, who he almost kidnapped, his friends and colleagues who he ultimately betrayed to save his own neck.  What became of them?  Another 15 minutes would have been great, but that aside, another great film from the legendary Scorsese.",

Scorsese pretty much makes macho films and I like a few of them...not much into gangsters. This is a macho movie, but it's hilarious and a treat to watch.\n\nScorsese deserves some credit, but the real work begins with DiCaprio. A few years ago, I thought maybe Christian Bale had delivered the best performance I'd seen in The Fighter. DiCaprio, in this movie, may take the title. He's unbelievably high-energy in playing this man. Without a solid lead, I don't care who directs it, it's shit. DiCaprio's madness makes the movie (and how about DiCaprio and McConaughey sharing the screen early on. It blew the greatness fuse).\n\nJonah Hill is actually really good, as are most of the characters. Margot Robbie was relatively quiet before this film. Her career will explode. That's an incredible looking woman and her imdb page already looks a lot busier. \n\nMy one complaint is the length of the movie. At just under three hours, it's a little tough to stick with. That said, the first 90 minutes are so are hilarious, and there are enough babes to keep your attention. As things slow down, things get a little tedious and drag on, but I guess it's all part of a pretty crazy story.",

DiCaprio really gives his all in this performance, despite probably deserving the Oscar after his fourth acting nomination this year compared to McConaughey's first ever nomination and win, Dallas Buyers Club was just heart-breaking and only rarely does the Academy go all out on honoring a comedy.\n\nA thoroughly deserved with for Best Actor in a Comedy/Musical at the Golden Globes - this movie is hilarious, and with all due respect to the cast of American Hustle, this picture should have definitely won Best - Comedy/Musical. You can help but laugh at the side-splitting exchanges between Belfort with the corrupt Swiss Banker, Jean-Jacques Saurel (Jean Dujardin) when we see Jordan's life of luxury begin to descend from this point on. \"What I'm asking, you Swiss dick, is are you going to f*ck me over?\"... \"I understand perfectly, you American sh*t.\" The comedic timing at this point, honestly, was impeccable. I was cracking up.\n\nEven though it's long, you kinda lose track of the time. You're caught up in a wild that just doesn't seem possible how such a way of earning a wealthy lifestyle can be unnoticed by the feds for such a prolonged amount of time - and with so many loopholes.\n\nAlthough minimal, I was rather impressed with the brief performance of DiCaprio's on screen first wife Teresa (played by Cristin Milioti) truly capturing the tempestuous wrongdoings of her husband's greed and infidelity. But, the supporting (if not central performance) which truly exemplifies a man's love of greed and losing it all through descending into anarchy was Jonah Hill's performance. Now, I'm the first to admit, I'd never really seen Jonah Hill in a major, critically-acclaimed and I will have to check out Moneyball to confirm this, but, oh my god, Hill's comedic talents truly play up this name in this movie... so convincing as a young newlywed wanting a piece of the big time despite not even being 30 years old!",

Jordan Belfort was golden child of american's finanse world. Quick and stunning success brought him fortune,fame and the feeling of being above the law. Temptations and opportunities were all around and Belfort liked taking them. The most beautiful womens. The most expensive yachts.The most fancy drugs. A crazy party without even a shade of being responsible, followed by unavoidable mistakes and coustant desire to want more and more. Comption, bending law and messing with taxes.Couple more examples of Belfort's master movements.Pumped up and funny, bitter story of a man who always wanted more and eventually got what he deserved. Wolf Dicaprio is a proffesional addict. He belives that all man gotta do is to constantl reach for more, no matter the consequences, but when he falls, he does it in equally spectacular way, under the influence of drugs. The list of drugs that he takes everyday is as long as known to mankind. In Wolf's life dominant things are : money, cocain and sex.\nDespite love of his life at his side he keeps on cheating on her with himself : his passion and desperate need to balance on the edge of physical possibility. Dicaprio finally creates a figure,which can present the full of his actor's talent. Though probably he will be skipped during the Oscar gala once again, but his extravergant performance in his movie is worth remembering. Nobody expects happy ending and its abvious that in the final scene we won't see the Wolf standing on elegant yacht with a drink in his hand but the judgment day won't be that terrible.Belfort is indestructible and money still run the world. In my opinion Wolf of Wall Street is genius and grotesque portrait of american greed culture that impress insults, terrifies but also amuses.",

The film decries none of these things, but it does decry them, and anything, really, in excess, and in particular the excess displayed inside the corrupted halls of Stratton Oakmont. The picture thrives on balance, even as it plays up Jordan's excesses almost to a breaking point. The film zooms well past the point of no return early on and will certainly offend many viewers with its unabashed depiction of wealth-induced narcotic, sexual, and verbal indulgence, but within that chaos is a purpose that trumps all of the visual and aural mayhem. It's easily one of the year's finest pictures and a must-see for audiences that can compartmentalize the film's structure and purpose and find the beautiful interconnect between them.",
