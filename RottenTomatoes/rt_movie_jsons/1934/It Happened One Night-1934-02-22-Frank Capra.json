            "content": "\"It Happened One Night\" is often dubbed the original romantic comedy. This movie has clearly inspired many tropes in the genre over the years that followed it. I admire the film for its influence in this regard. As a movie, I felt like this is one of those movies that just feels a bit dated. The story is pretty good and the actors are delightful, but because it is the basis for the genre, it is hard to watch it without the lens that I have seen movies I like more in this genre before. This is something I can't control, but it makes watching the film just an okay experience for me in the modern age. Overall, it is an influential film that is a piece of history, but just not one of my personal favorites.",

            "content": "Hilarious jokes with a cute romantic dynamic.\n\nDirector Frank Capra (It's a Wonderful Life & Mr. Smith Goes to Washington) directed one of the greatest romantic comedies ever with It Happened One Night (1934)! It flies by for a quickly paced 105 of cute back and forth jokes that lead to a sweet little romance. Capra's direction is playful for lighthearted romance and stylish shots for the moody driving of the Night Bus. Joseph Walker's cinematography excels with the Night Bus headlights peering into the midnight darkness and pouring rain. Stephen Goosson's art direction shows off mossy trees and natural spaces for a lovely aesthetic for It Happened One Night.\n\nCapra's sterling direction held my attention. He kept the pace fast and jokes constant. He's got a moody atmosphere for every night scene and foggy forest, while keepings things bright for the daylight romancing. Gene Havlick's editing cuts scenes into concise romantic comedy moments for non-stop laughs. His fast cutting during the hitchhiking sequence is a riot. Sydney Moore's Night Bus dingy set decoration and straw covered outside is fun.\n\nWriter Robert Riskin crafts hilarious jokes, endearing romance, with really likable characters. Riskin adapts Samuel Hopkins Adams' cute short story \"Night Bus\" with charming playfulness to his romantic comradery and witty humor. Capra's humanist viewpoint helps Adams' narrative of an average reporter humbling a spoiled socialite as they get acquainted on a Night Bus. It Happened One Night is a fun concept for a meet-cute scenario.\n\nClark Gable is very tough and charismatic as the dashing reporter Peter Warne. He's gruff enough to feel realistically stern and disapproving, but kind enough to feel like a romantic hero. He's got great romantic chemistry with Claudette Colbert. Gable and Colbert have a similar scoundrel and spoiled brat dynamic as Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan in French Kiss to me. \n\nClaudette Colbert is lovely and hilarious as a spoiled heiress named Ellie Andrews. She's delightful to watch with excellent comedic timing, a cute face, and pleasant manner as she bums around for money. She's moving as she pleads for Gable to take her with him. I found Claudette Colbert charming as Ellie with a sweet sincerity, doe eyed innocence, and elegant grace.\n\nWalter Connolly is loud and crazy as Ellie's boisterous millionaire father Alexander Andrews. Roscoe Karns is creepy as the obnoxious sleaze that hits on Colbert. His bus passenger Oscar Shapeley is selfish and annoying in a fun appearance. Alan Hale's singing car driver Danker is hysterical. Jameson Thomas is just the type of dullard as King Westley to make Clark Gable look even cooler. George Breakston is heartbreaking as the bus passenger boy whose mother collapses. Ward Bond is a riot as the indignant first bus driver.\n\nComposer Howard Jackson's score is very playful and pretty. He fits It Happened One Night's sweet romantic comedy vibe. All the singing characters are a blast. Edward Bernds' sound design captures the voices clearly and provides neat ambient noises for the environment with croaking frogs and chirping cicadas. Costume designer Robert Kalloch made a cute striped suit and skirt with all sorts of robes and suits for Clark Gable.\n\nIn all, It Happened One Night feels highly influential to romantic comedies as the archetype of the rough guy ending up with the pampered girl.",

            "content": "From the director of the timeless classic that is It's a Wonderful Life, comes It Happened One Night, a wonderful film that is as charming as it is funny. While some parts are quite idealistic, it is essentially a screwball romantic comedy and a great one at that. The direction from Frank Capra is classy and dignified and cleverly gives us an insight into gender and class status, and the screenplay is sophisticated and funny. The humour still works, I found myself laughing when Clark Gable said \"now don't tell you're in love with the bus driver\" for example. The cinematography is beautiful and dynamic and the music is richly and sensitively scored. The acting is very, very good. Clark Gable looks handsome here, and he gives a close to hysterical performance as Peter, with his impeccable comic timing and witty humour. Claudette Colbert is lovely as Ellie, the spoiled yet somewhat independent heiress who Peter falls for. The two actors show great, charming chemistry together on screen, and they are terrifically supported by especially Walter Connolly as Andrews. The story is relatively simple, but I liked its simplicity, it was effective. Overall, a wonderful, funny and charming film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Frank Capra said that until It Happened One Night drama had four stock characters:  the hero, the heroine, the comedian, and the villain.\n\nWhat Capra did and you might notice he followed it in a whole lot of his films, the characters of hero and comedian are combined.  Not completely as Colbert gets a few laughs herself.  But in doing what he did for Clark Gable's character, Capra created a whole new type of screen comedy, the screwball and It Happened One Night set the mold.\n\nCapra's autobiography told the story of the making of It Happened One Night which in itself could be a movie. Capra worked for Columbia Pictures which at that time was a minor studio, along the lines of Republic or Monogram. As Capra tells it he had a vision about this story that Samuel Hopkins Adams wrote and persuaded Harry Cohn to buy it.\n\nCapra also had a stroke of good luck. Adolph Zukor at Paramount and Louis B. Mayer at MGM were looking to punish a couple of recalcitrant stars, Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable. The idea was to show these two what it was like to work in a small budget studio without all the perks of Paramount and MGM. In fact the description of Gable arriving to work at Columbia that first day, drunk as a skunk, is priceless. Capra dressed him down good and said that to his credit Gable came to work afterwards and couldn't have been more cooperative.\n\nAt some point Harry Cohn at Columbia was convinced that maybe Capra had something. He had in fact delivered for Columbia the previous year with Lady for a Day. So the publicity drums were beat.\n\nThe rest as they say is history. It Happened One Night won the first Oscar grand slam, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Actress. It won the first Oscars Columbia Pictures ever got and lifted it right into the ranks of the major studios. And it set the standard for screwball comedy.\n\nThe film could never have gotten off the ground were it not for the chemistry of Gable and Colbert. They're together for most of the film so if it doesn't click between the two of them, you have people walking out in droves. Colbert had already played a wide variety of parts at Paramount, ranging from Poppaea and Cleopatra to comedies with Maurice Chevalier like The Big Pond. Gable had played a whole lot of tough guys on both sides of the law at MGM. It Happened One Night showed he had some real comic talent, a flair MGM exploited in his roles from then on in.\n\nGable and Colbert did only one other film together, Boom Town for MGM. You can't get much more different than those two films. Boom Town had a huge MGM budget, Spencer Tracy and Hedy Lamarr as well, and a lot of special effects involving the oil industry and hazards therein. It's also a great film, but it's not a classic like It Happened One Night.\n113 out of 120 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

Colbert already is on the loose and is being pursued. Along the way, she runs into and must depend on Gable, who is quite glib and very funny. As the two of them make their way across the country, they find themselves in near compromising conditions. We have the famous \"Wall of Jericho\" where they sleep in the same bed with a bed sheet acting as a barrier. Colbert is defiant; Gable is flirtatious. Remember the famous scene where Colbert gets a driver to stop and pick them up by sticking out her exposed leg. Frank Capra gave us all these films about Americana and this is one that has captured our being for decades. The byplay between the principle characters is worth the effort.",

It is never dull, and the story keeps you off-balance so the viewer never can really be sure how things will turn out.\n\nA spoiled daughter of a very rich father, tiring of his gilded cage, finally runs off to elope with a daredevil aviator, who is in New York. The father hires a slew of detectives to locate her, but she manages to get on a bus with a reporter who has heard about her situation and wants a big story to boost his career. With that purpose, he helps the daughter on her way to New York, but plenty of things go wrong along the way. And to make matters worse, the father decides to allow the marriage to take place-but complications ensue from that.\n\nGreat character interaction and acting not only between the two leads, but between each of them as well as side characters make the story exciting, and the atmosphere of a dull, irritating bus ride and later running through the countryside is perfectly conveyed. Arguably one of the greatest of Frank Capra's movies.",

Watching it with no context, it is a rather dated lightweight rom com that managed to win best picture at the 1934 Oscars, though few of the best picture winners from the era have aged well.  My opinion of the film improved actually by watching the special features (the main reason I bother with DVDs anymore), particularly the commentary from Frank Capra Jr.  He tells a story of a picture that was not considered to be much of anything by its lead actress, who insisted she had to go on vacation in four weeks and the film simply had to be done in that timeframe.  The result of this hectic and frenetic shooting schedule was a film that FEELS frenetic in terms of its pacing, and it took someone pointing this out to me to see what an amazing, seat-of-your-pants thing it was that the film got made at all, let alone to the great acclaim it received from audiences and critics.  This certainly deepened my respect for if not my enjoyment of this film.  It's got some really funny sequences and is worth the watch!",

I had actually never seen Clark Gable in a movie before and found myself surprised at how slight and skinny he seemed. Most of the comedy has withstood the passing of time, though like most rom-coms they don't lean into it heavily enough to make the movie as funny as it could've been. Until this movie I'd been very surprised that I liked all the Capra movies I'd seen as he was a conservative with values that aren't held by anyone but the villains in some of his movies; this one was the first I'd seen where Robert Riskin was the screenwriter and it made much more sense after that as Robert (a  big liberal) apparently wrote Frank's earliest successes and Frank repeated them later. Of particular note to me was how much better this movie was than the Best Picture winner from the year prior as that was one of my least-favorite movies of all time; this one being extremely good cements my opinion that Cavalcade just sucked and that it wasn't representative of this era of movies.

            "content": "\"TAKES MY BREATH AWAY\" LOVE FILMS\nby Timothy J. Verret\n\nI'm as drawn to love films as a beautiful and majestic horse is drawn to water. I create so much about and from the notion of love that it sometimes is hard for me to take a decent, deep breath. Here are 10 (actually 11) films about love (or the lack thereof) that \"take my breath away\" and heal my still-sometimes-very-broken heart (BOTH!):\n\n1. SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE (1998):\nThis would indeed be my all-time favorite love film because it's got Shakespeare and it's got that message: \"Love is the ONLY inspiration.\" This film is inspired by a great and awe-inspiring love for acting, writing, directing, and how passion engages all of these things in one love film. Even if this film was not an ode to why Shakespeare wrote sonnets in the first place, the scene where Viola is onstage in a staged production of Shakespeare's ROMEO AND JULIET and William is lovingly looking at her from the wings is more than enough of a reason why I adore this love film. Viola loves William, William loves Viola, and the music takes us away to just this one moment of two looks and two smiles all looked and smiled in the name of a beautiful, all-encompassing love. That scene alone \"takes my breath way\" every time I see it. Even though this film is #10 on my all-time favorite films' list, it is solidly #1 on my all-time favorite love films' list (I guess you could say, \"so the last shall be first, and the first shall be last\" [Matthew 20:16]). 😉\n\n2. SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE (1973):\nSwedish director Ingmar Bergman is not known for gushy and silly love films, but this film IS a very serious love film because Bergman gives us both the glory and grime of a marriage dissolving. In true and typical Bergman fashion, each scene of this film is a very serious \"take my breath away,\" because the truth and turmoil at the heart of this marriage ending are about as real as my hand in front of my face. Liv Ullmann and Erland Josephson as Marianne and Johan give towering performances. I will never forget the scene where Marianne and Johan go to the lawyer's office to sign the divorce papers and literally get into a fist fight. After the fight (and the marriage) is over, they both with their tattered hair and hearts sign the divorce papers. This film is as stunning as it is sacrificial. Marriage IS sacrifice and when that's not there, stunning is any marriage's dissolvement. I probably could have listed a handful of Ingmar Bergman films that explore the theme of this kind of intense love, but I have to keep this list as brief as possible.😉\n\n3. MARRIAGE STORY (2019):\nVery much like SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE, this film is haunting and often horribly uneasy to sit through. Scarlett Johansson as Nicole and Adam Driver as Charlie give exceptionally riveting performances as a married couple with way too big egos (she is an actress and he is a theatre director and if that's not \"way too big egos,\" I don't know what is). I will never forget the scene where Nicole goes to Charlie's apartment and they are in the throws of so much anger and so much hurt that the walls of Charlie's apartment are about to come down. Johansson's Nicole delivers to Driver's Charlie the line that is THE line where love hoped to save this marriage and love can't save this marriage intersect, \"You're so merged with your own selfishness, you don't even identify it as selfishness anymore!\" That line \"took my breath away\" because I totally identified with it. A marriage on its way to a divorce is all about selfishness unidentified anymore. The proclaimed egos of both partners \"win out\" and when ego \"wins out,\" everything is \"lost in\" a marriage war of two \"way too big egos.\"\n\n4. THE DANISH GIRL (2015):\nIt's so cool that this film is #4 on this list, as #4 is my spiritual number. It's also cool that this film is #4 on my all-time favorite films' list, as well. The story of Gerda and Einar (Lily) Wegener is what love films should always be about: The sacrifice one partner needs to make for a marriage to survive (often times in a marriage, both partners have to make sacrifices). Gerda makes the ultimate sacrifice by accepting that her husband, Einar, believes he is a woman and wants to have an operation to become Lily, the woman he always was on the inside. Anyone else that I can think of in Gerda's position would have said in response to this, \"no way, no how….this marriage is OVER!\" Gerda loves Einar so much that she is willing to do just about anything (and she does) to keep their love alive. Alicia Vikander (Oscar winner for Best Supporting Actress) is an absolute and complete revelation in her performance as Gerda, and Eddie Redmayne completely and totally seals the deal in his performance in this film to make him my all-time favorite actor next to Joaquin Phoenix. I swear I could go on and on about how this film \"takes my breath away\" at every twist and turn where love is concerned but, once again, I'm needing to be brief here.😉\n\n5. YENTL (1983):\nVery similar to THE DANISH GIRL, this film is not your conventional love film. It's about a woman who loves this man who thinks a woman is a man, this man who loves another woman who is also a woman but since he can't have this other woman, the man asks a woman to marry this other woman so he can be close to this other woman, and a woman who this man thinks is a man marries this other woman, and if none of that \"takes your breath away,\" I'm not sure what ever would! This film \"takes my breath away\" because it's simply about the lengths and heights and depths we find ourselves reaching for in the throes (or thrown) of love. And because I am a huge Barbra Streisand fan and this is Barbra's best film EVER, I can't think of any other love film that pleases and excites me more than this one. And never mind that it is mainly because of Barbra Streisand and my love for her that helped me to believe that I could ever be someone someday who could love someone someday. Now, that \"takes my breath away.\"\n\n6. WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? (1966):\nWhile most in a million years would never call this film a \"love film,\" I do because it's a film about the absence of love in a marriage, the absence that is SO common in a lot of marriages, and an absence so penetrable that the married couple in this film actually make up that they have a child to keep the marriage bearable. Edward Albee's play and Mike Nichols' film adaptation are what I love most about stories where love has flown the coop (if it was ever in the coop in the first place), i.e., the dissection and probing of the insides of people who are losing their identity because love has become nonexistent while brutality and mean-spiritedness are what's left to exist. Elizabeth Taylor, known for her striking beauty, goes from \"riches to rags\" in her physical beauty and gives us an \"ugly\" Martha, a force of nature who is as forceful as she is vulnerable. Taylor, Best Actress Oscar winner) gives what I consider the very best female performance ever captured on film. Richard Burton as George and George Segal as Nick are also excellent, but it's the other female performance of Sandy Dennis as Honey (Best Supporting Actress Oscar winner) that makes this love film truly one that \"takes my breath away\" every time I see it….and I've seen it a lot!😉\n\n7. TESS (1980):\nIf there can be any love film that is truly lovely to look it, it would be this film. Based on Thomas Hardy's classic novel of the same name, Roman Polanski directed this film that makes the novel come breathtakingly and beautifully alive. This film \"takes my breath away\" not just because it's pretty to look at but also because it is rapturous and daring to expose seduction between a man and a woman as actually rape, and how that one act of domination produces shame that stays with the victim. I know that one's shame is to be nailed to The Cross of Jesus but for some, death is the one way, and maybe the only way, to be rid of that shame. Nastassja Kinski as Tess might not be the best actress who ever lived, but Polanksi knew exactly what he was doing by casting her in the title role. Because Kinski was a relative unknown and maybe because Polanski knew she wasn't the greatest actress around, it was precisely these two very things that allowed Kinski to inhabit Tess as bright-eyed innocent, and naïve. A well-known and a great actress would have destroyed these precious traits, so thank God Polanski and Kinski didn't. There's one scene of a closeup of Tess with the brightest yellow sun behind her that to this day, every time I see a sun like that, it \"takes my breath away,\" and I call it, \"the Tess sun.\" LOVE THAT! ❤️\n\n8. THE WAY WE WERE (1973):\nIt certainly makes sense that I would have two Barbra Streisand films on this list but even if I didn't love Streisand, this film would be on it anyway and probably most others' \"love film\" list. It's the ultimate love story of the girl over there and the guy over here and how there and here come together and we are all the better for being present to witness that. The odds are that two beautiful actors like Redford and Streisand couldn't possibly go wrong in a beautiful love film that ends with a closing scene that still \"takes my breath away.\" Streisand's Katie and Redford's Hubbell are looking at each other after having separated when famous Streisand takes that famous hand and famously brushes away that famous hair from Redford's famous face. \"See ya', Katie.\" \"See ya' Hubbell.\" See me balling my eyes out.😥😥\n\n9. CASABLANCA (1942):\nWhile not the film I would have included on my \"take my breath away\" love films' list, I'm including it because it's on the top of the list for two of my favorite people and because any film with an actor or actress with the last name of \"Bergman\" should be on any film list I compile (see #2 for that \"other Bergman\" film). That said, I have seen this film and I remember loving it very much. Many \"love film\" aficionado's are divided into two camps where this film's ending is concerned: One group wants Rick to let Ilsa board that plane to Lisbon with Laszlo for The Resistance, while the other group says, \"C'mon! Rick and Ilsa forever! We're not talking about The Resistance here! We're talking about love!\" This film reminds us that love doesn't always end as victorious as The Resistance, but what we cannot \"resist\" is that we loved in the first place. That is usually enough for any kind of love to take flight.\n\n10. IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT (1934) and SOMEWHERE IN TIME (1980):\nI admit I was torn between which of these films to include to round out the top 10 \"take my breath away\" love films, until it dawned on me that both films have something very much in common: The element of time when and where love is lost and/or found. IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT is simple enough to say love can happen one night, whereas SOMEWHERE IN TIME says one night is fine, but true love cannot be contained by the element of time. Love can happen one night, sure, and then more nights can happen after that, but sometimes you have to go \"somewhere in time\" to find that love again. Whether one night or \"somewhere in time,\" love alters us to our very core and we do search time and space to find it, but there are no guarantees that the Jericho Walls (reference to the ending of IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT) will stay up or come down when love happens in just one night or \"somewhere\" outside of space and time for a lifetime.\n\nNow, I'm not currently in a love relationship (unless you count Jesus) but if I were, my partner would need to have seen AT LEAST one of these films. If not, watching AT LEAST one of these films is essential if any partner who loves me expects to \"take my breath away.\" 😉❤️",

But, six years later, I gave a second try at it and… boy, my first impressions on one of the funniest classic romantic comedies ever made were completely wrong. In Miami, Ellie (Claudette Colbert), the spoiled daughter of a millionaire, runs away because her father wants to annul her marriage. At a bus to New York, she comes across a newspaper journalist, Peter (Clark Gable) and they of course hate each other, only to bond together during their runaway. The best parts about the movie are when she has no choice but to follow Peter's shoes, whether it's sleeping next to him on the bus, roleplaying in front of the detectives, hitchhiking, sleeping in the hay, or eating a carrot. As funny as those scenes are, the circumstance that she's on the run from the police, her fiance and her father and she could be left behind and get caught in any time creates tension as well as a connection between the two. Another great scene is at the wedding in the end just after her father reveals Peter's love for her. Not only is the payoff funny, but her decision to reject her fiance and ditch the altar during the matrimony is satisfyingly heartwarming. Even if you know what's going to happen, It Happened One Night is still a brilliantly-played, wonderfully funny love story and a quintessential example of the ultimate screwball comedy. If you love classic films, pop this movie in and give it a watch. \n\n(4 ½ Shirtless Clark Gables out of 5)",

This movie is one of only three films ever to sweep Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Lead Actor and Best Lead Actress.  Directed by Frank Capra, the movie is a charming comedy that teams two of the era's top stars, Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert.\n\nColbert plays Ellie Andrews, a spoiled heiress who recently eloped against her father's wishes.  He fears her new husband is interested only in the fortune that Ellie will eventually inherit.  He attempts to hold Ellie against her will while he arranges for an annulment.  Ellie escapes her confinement, boards a bus to New York and during the journey meets boozy newspaper reporter Peter Warne.  As with most good romcoms, the two are initially quite abrasive, but through circumstance they slowly warm to each other.  Peter eventually realizes who she is and agrees to help her reach New York if she will give him her exclusive story.  Colbert and Gable have a wonderful chemistry and an intimacy that transcends the rather light script.  \n\nMy one complaint with the movie was the use of two actors in their mid-to-late thirties playing characters that are quite obviously intended to be much younger.  In fact, twice when Colbert first meets Gable's character she is given the task of referring to as \"young man\".  It's a little much.  \n\nMuch of the dialogue is outdated but this film is still a solid one, and it evokes some great laughter as these two people find a new and mutual path together.",

            "content": "Frank Capra's Academy Award for Best Picture-winning It Happened One Night is a romantic comedy that can also be (and has been) fairly accurately described as a screwball comedy. Many decades after it was made, it remains frequently very funny, but as one of the last pre-Code movies it is also worth watching for its risqué aspects, which the following year it might not have gotten away with.\nIt happened One Night has a fairly predictable story that sees heiress Ellie Andrews running away from her father after he tries to have her marriage annulled and setting off on a cross country road trip for which she is spectacularly ill-equipped in order to reach her husband. She soon falls in with drunken newspaper reporter Peter Warne, and they take an instant dislike to one another: it doesn't take a great leap of imagination to work out how their relationship will unfold. And indeed Capra doesn't even bother trying to keep the audience guessing about where the film is heading, but provides a slightly mad-cap romp – written at the last minute on the insistence of his stars – in order to make the journey more interesting.\nWhat is striking about the film is that it thus revolves around a love affair between a single man and a married woman, something that the Code would almost certainly have not allowed. Or at least not in a screwball comedy in which Peter flippantly strips to his trousers in front of Ellie and later slaps her on the backside as he carries her across a river. By modern standards, the film is positively tame, but at the time it must have raised a few eyebrows. Especially as it concludes with Ellie abandoning her husband at the altar (their first wedding having been annulled) whilst her father looks on gleefully.\nNonetheless, this doesn't mean that It Happened One Night should be watched merely as a historical cinematic curiosity: it remains hugely entertaining. The on-screen chemistry between its two stars is palpable and Claudette Colbert is perfectly cast as the petulant Ellie, capable of being alternately irritating and endearing, whilst Clark Gable demonstrates great comic timing as Peter. The film is often very funny, from Claudette diving into the sea from her father's boat, through such scenes as Peter and her posing as an arguing couple to hide her real identity from a pair of detectives, to Peter's hilarious moment when Roscoe Karns' Oscar Shapeley tries to blackmail him into turning Ellie in for the reward her father has posted and Peter terrifies him by pretending that he's kidnapped her and wants his help in a possible shoot out with the cops.\nThe film is full of amusing moments. There's the hitch-hiking scene, the scene when Peter fails to thumb a lift after several attempts an Ellie succeeds by flashing her leg at a passing car, and Peter's brilliantly grumpy conversation with Ellie's father when he demands reimbursement for all of the belongings that he had to sacrifice whilst escorting her across country. In addition to the two stars, the story is filled with vaguely outlandish characters, resulting in great comedic performances from all concerned, including Karns but also Alan Hale as Danker, the singing car driver, Charles C. Wilson as Joe Gordon, Warne's newspaper editor boss, and Walter Connolly as Alexander Andrews, Ellie's possessive father (brilliantly, when he orders a telegram sent to the detectives he wants to track Ellie down, it begins with the line \"daughter escaped again\").\nIn amongst all of the jokes and comic set-pieces, the film is often quite touching too, such as when Ellie realises that she loves Peter and when – having returned home – her supposedly controlling father is sensitive enough to realise that she has found somebody other than her husband and promises to move heaven and earth to make her happy. It is often the little things that make the film great – the sing-along scene for example, which shows Ellie slowly shaking off her spoilt outlook on life. Much of this is down to Capra. A director who eschewed flashy techniques, he brings a perfect lightness of touch to the film and Joseph Walker's cinematography suits his style, with shots that allow the cast room to move. Despite its age, the film still looks pretty good, although some of the exteriors are obviously filmed on studio sets rather than locations. That said, the sets are impressively detailed and convincing enough. \nThe only way in which It Happened One Night hasn't aged well is in Alexander slapping his daughter's face and Peter suggesting that she needs a husband who will occasionally \"sock\" her to keep her in line: it's an alarmingly casual attitude to violence towards women that isn't comfortable. But when watching old films, it is inevitable that disturbing anachronisms will occasionally be found: they are the only sour note in a film that otherwise remains both funny and charming.",

Clark Gable has star quality and lights up every scene he is in. Claudette Colbert is nearly his equal and is more convincing before she actually falls in love with him. I really enjoyed the ending as she runs from her wedding and how Clark Gable discusses to his father in law how mad it would be to be love with her. The singing trapeze song on the bus was another highlight as was the initial scene with Clark Gable as he is drunk on the phone to his boss. They are both very different in their lives with Claudette Colbert's character having barely lived or been allowed to and never ever meeting a man like Clark Gable's character. A film about class and money and in the end the father understands what his daughter wants with more freedom and to love the right man.

            "content": "If you like romantic comedies, It Happened One Night by Frank Capra, is the film for you to see. It features a spoiled heiress, Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert), who escapes the control of her father and heads for New York to reunite with her husband. On the bus ride there she meets a recently-fired newspaper reporter by the name of Peter Warne (Clark Gable). They strike a deal that helps them both get what they want; but along the way they gain more than they bargained for… they fall stubbornly in love with one another. With phenomenal cinematography, thoughtful storyline, clever dialogue, top-notch acting, and endearing humor, this film will have you pressing play a million times over. Let's dissect all the wonderful elements that went into making this film so memorable. \n\tWhat is a good film without quality acting? A bad one… Luckily for It Happened One Night, the acting was up to par with the rest of the movie. With sharp, witty, bounce-back dialogue Gable and Colbert had a flawless on-screen connection. Even side actors such as Roscoe Karns who played Oscar Shapley did a wonderful job and played their parts well. Facial expressions were genuine and reaction time was generous! It was easy to remember the scenes where good acting stuck out, because it was the entire movie. One of my favorite scenes to appreciate the acting in the film was the one where detectives find Ellie in the camp home and she and Peter have to put on a show to disguise her. It's difficult to act as an actor or actress without the result feeling corny. But this scene wasn't corny at all… it was enjoyably ridiculous! Now let's get serious; acting is way harder than it looks. This is why I was so impressed with the natural and realistic portrayals of emotions in this movie. Claudette Colbert did a magnificent job in the role of Ellie Andrews. One scene specifically stuck out to me. It was near the end of the film, when she was getting ready for her wedding with King Westley. At first, she seems disconnected. She's smoking a cigarette, drinking, and feeling everything but happy on her wedding day. Her father notices she's not quite herself, he even says that she's changed, and coaxes a confession out of her. The way that she clings to her fathers coat in tears and the way she fumbles over her own words as she explains everything makes the outburst seem so real. Then, after her father shows her the letter Peter sent regarding payment, she immediately changes her tune. She goes from crying and heartbroken to carefree and cold shouldered. She holds back her tears and cheers to a \"never ending merry-go-round\" life with King. This attempt to shrug off her emotions and dive into a meaningless relationship is what some might call a rebound. Which sadly is a realistic coping method, and she does it so well! This film has also done such a wonderful job at character development. One example of this is shown through the character of Ellie Andrews. In the begging of the movie, Peter helps Ellie with nearly everything. Chasing after her stolen bag, sitting with her on the bus, rationing her spending, saying she's his wife to help hide her true identity, etcetera. She appears as helpless, careless, and naive. But further into the movie, during the hitchhiking scene, we see her true capability clearly for the very first time. After Peters failed attempts to halt a car, she succeeds on her first try. Perhaps this confidence and self capability could be a trait she picked up from Peter along the way. In addition to the audience gaining a deeper sense of who this character is, it also aids to the compatibility of her and Peter, since Peter is well grounded in the ways self reliance. We also see characters go through developmental stages such as denial. Particularly Gables character, Peter Warne. When Ellie asked him what he was thinking after they almost kissed he denied his feelings and hid what he was really thinking. He covered it up with a lie in the form of an insult towards her. We see Peter in denial again during the scene where Ellie confesses her love to him in the motel and he tells her to \"go back to bed\". Another character development tribute was defeat. This is shown in the climax of the film. Through the big misunderstanding between Ellie and Peter, we see defeat in both of them. Ellie intends to go through with her plans to marry King and gives up trying to be with Peter because she thinks he ran from her. Meanwhile Peter gives up trying to be with Ellie and buys back his love story because he thinks she turned herself in and took him for a ride. \n\tThe cinematography, done by Robert Riskin, was completely remarkable. It was truly notable in many of the intimate scenes shared between Colbert and Gables characters, which I noticed usually happened in the night and focused on the conversations they had just before bed. The first instance of this was when their bus got stuck and they had to lodge together in a camp home. Something about that scene, after the lights were turned off, was so beautiful. It wasn't simply one aspect of the scene, it was every aspect, put together all at once, that made it visually and mentally poetic. The lighting that resulted in rich black and whites, the silence between them and the quiet presence of what's being left unsaid, the beat of the rain on the roof and the imagery of it running down the windows, and last but not least, the framework created by the \"Walls of Jericho\" (as stated in the movie). The scene is still, yet has a truly cinematic flow to it. Riskin pulled off this scene and two more relatively similar to it, which is hard to do. Reiteration in cinema often comes across as repetitive and unnecessary. However, Riskin's execution was so subtly different each time that it felt like a whole new idea while still allowing audiences to feel the same things as before. It's completely genius. These three scenes have what one could call an \"evolution\", which is part of what Riskin altered slightly each time to prevent them from feeling too familiar. This so-called evolution is the rate at which the characters feelings for each other heighten. Within three beautifully filmed scenes, we see them go from butterflies and silence to deep love and outcries. Along with those three distinct scenes, I noticed an interesting part of the film where a sound transition played a role. It took watching this movie twice to notice it, but I believe that that simply proves how naturally it fit in. It's important to appreciate when a filmmaker pulls off an out of the ordinary task without it taking the audience out of the movie. When Ellies father is searching for her in a plane, the sound of the engine transudes into the next scene where Ellie is waking up in the camp home she's hiding away at. The audio of the plane carries a few seconds into the scene implying that her father is passing over the campsite. This gives a really cool effect because it tells the audience that she hears the plane and is completely unaware that it's her fathers search party. Later into the scene, detectives show up at her door and she and Peter put on an act to disguise her. This proves the theory of it being her fathers plane passing over the campsite. This movie really succeeded at involving the audience and bringing them into the movie. I think this is best shown through the climax of the movie when Peter is racing back to the motel to get there before Ellie wakes up. As a member of the audience, I felt the hectic motions of this scene. Elements such as short camera shots, fast transitions, train passings, loud audio of sirens, and car chases aided the chaotic flow of this part of the movie. The speed of the scene and the reaction time left for the audience to understand what's happening was well balanced and received the desired affect upon the viewers— anxiety. If you're trying to give the audience a feeling of frustration and stress, this tactic of allowing them to know something the characters don't is a clever way to do so. Audiences were overwhelmed and frustrated to see this big misunderstanding between the characters unfold. As for myself, I wanted to scream at the screen loud enough so the characters on it would hear me, understand, and change their ways. Sadly, this did not work.\n\tThis movie did a fantastic job foreshadowing. For example, during the bus boarding scene where Peter is talking with his ex boss in the telephone booth, the men surrounding him call him by the name of \"King\". They say things like \"Make way for the King!\" and \"Long live the King!\". Let's keep in mind that Ellie Andrews is married to a man by the actual name of King Westley. This casually hints that Ellie will end up with Peter and, if the audience pieces it together, gives the entire films ending away. Another time that foreshadowing is used is when Peter and Ellie are riding the bus and the band on board starts to play. The lyrics talk about a man who's jealous of another because he gets all the girls he wants, including his true love. The same could be applied to Peter and King. This foreshadowing is disguised by the joy of a sing-along song. It's interesting how foreshadowing can be so subtle yet so obvious. \n\tIt Happened One Night was a pre-production code film, which allowed it to get away with many things that it would not have if it was released after the Production Code Agency was in motion. Filmmakers had to submit their works to the PCA to receive a stamp of approval. If the film had elements that violated the production code, it would be denied approval and sent back with notes of necessary edits and adjustments to make it \"theater-ready\". Capra's film featured many of the production codes's no-no's including underdressing, two people (who were not married to each other) sleeping in the same room, smoking and drinking, crude humor (for its time) including a scene where Peter spanks Ellie, the idea of a married woman almost kissing another man, and finally, insinuative scenes such as the last one where the so-called \"Walls of Jericho\" topple. Despite the fact that it did not fit the production code, It Happened One Night was a huge success. It won five academy awards including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Writing Adaption. This was known as the \"Big Five\" and was the first film to achieve this accomplishment. Fun fact; Gable's Oscar was auctioned off for $607,500.00 and now belongs to the Motion Picture Academy. Colbert's Oscar was also auctioned but no bids were made… awkward. But the important thing to note isn't that Gable's Oscar is more valuable than Colbert's… it's that thing film was resoundingly magnificent and worthy of all the awards.",

There is not a lot of movies, in my opinion, that leads the audience on a trail of breadcrumbs the way this film does. Throughout the entire film, there is a sense of romance between our two characters, yet it is a very taboo romance. It is not your usual lovey dovey romance, it's more of a tough love. It is something about these two characters that really emphasize this. \n\nOur two main characters were an act of genius. Their personalities constantly battled in a fun and almost cute way. It was always foreshadowed these two would end up together, but the film was made in a way to keep the audience's doubt all the way up until the very end.\n\nNot only is this movie cute, but it also has a lot of comedic value as well. Comedic lines and actions that still hold up today, which is rare for older films.\n\nClark Gable and Claudette Colbert deserve every award for this performance. This movie was heavily carried by these two actors and throughout the entire piece their perform seemed to shine. A favorite scene of mine is when the two are sitting by the side of the road hoping to wave down a friendly driver. What actually happened was a fantastic perform from these two.\n\nOverall, It Happened One Night did a phenomenal job of creating a warm and fun atmosphere with the help of the comedic values, and the shining personality of its characters. For me, I tend to rarely watch movies more than once, but this one absolutely deserves another viewing.",

It Happened One Night was a very enjoyable film that grabs your attention right away and takes you on one hilarious ride. The best part of this film are the characters. the main characters chemistry is gold, the minor characters also stand out as every minor character shines in their little amount of screen time.

It Happened One Night created a cliche for romantic movies, the stubborn man and woman who hate each other because their so alike, but come from different backgrounds.

            "content": "It Happened One Night (1934)\nDirector Frank Capra\n\tIt Happened One Night is a good film for the time. It wonderfully portrays screwball comedy and is a blueprint for romantic comedies of the modern time. But certain factors of the film make it harder to see today. The chemistry between Peter, played by Clark Gable, and Ellie, played by Claudette Colbert, is fantastic and there quick wit flirtuos jabs at each other is replicated multiple times in todays Rom Com. But at the same time while it tries to be empowering to women doesn't quite hit that spot. \t\n\tThe acting done by Gable and Colbert is charming and also realistic with it being built in historical context. Gable, who plays a working class journalist, has to deal with Colbert's character, a born rich girl. Their interactions throughout the film shows how people in the 30's felt about each class, how the working class felt that the upper class is crude and spoiled, while the upper class just is trying to deal with their own problems and insecurities. Gable and Colberts build in the film to a romantic relationship gives off the hope of how good people in the world can still achieve their goals and deserve to be treated equally. This can also be seen in the amazing bus singing scene where people of all stages of life unite to sing songs with one another. Another theme this film plays off of is the city living vs the country living. Back in the 30's people started moving towards big cities and people would start to envy and detest people who lived in the city. In this film Gable and Colbert have to travel from the city into the country to find themselves and achieve their goals. This theme while being relatable isn't as popular in today's age. While this is one reason it doesn't hold up a bigger reason is the way Gable and Colbert interact with each other. In some ways it's charming and fun but other times it's demeaning to Colbert. We see Gable threaten to hurt Colbert and treat her as if she knows absolutely nothing of the world. In some ways this film was empowering for women in the 30's but in today's age this film does more harm than good.\n\tWhile this film is fun and the pacing keeps something happening every minute the film doesn't hold as well because of some political reasons. This doesn't stop it from being a charming movie that is entertaining and showcases how the relationships of classes with one another in a brilliant way.",

            "content": "If you've ever commuted by bus, you probably already know that the rides are usually long and boring with the passengers all turning to their phones for entertainment. With that in mind, it's interesting to see the road trip dynamic done well in It Happened One Night. The reason it's done so well is that it's a light-hearted screwball comedy and because it was wise to conform to the production code standards of the time. \n    It Happened One Night is essentially a screwball comedy that takes place as a road trip. It stars Clark Gable as Peter, the bitter journalist who's recently been fired, and Claudette Colbert as Ellie, the somewhat spoiled woman who's desperate to get away from her father.  Together they travel on a bus towards New York, along the way encountering all sorts of problems and mischief. There is a pleasant dynamic between Ellie and Peter that I think works because they are characters that are fundamentally different. This film being a romantic-comedy it's only appropriate to mention that it's one of those cases of Opposites Attract. The film's plot moves along nicey and it doesn't feel too long. The comedy sprinkled throughout, keeping the film light and wholesome. I would also point out that some of the comedy stems from the difference in times. I find the dynamic between Peter and Ellie dated, but that is what makes it comical to me.\n    The other thing that's noteworthy about this film is how it adheres to the Motion Picture Production Code. At a time that skeptics of the code were sure that any film that is under those restrictions was sure to do bad, this film managed to break those expectations. Much of this film's success stems from what I think is a classy approach to its themes. The romance between Peter in Ellie is a constant back and forth that never turns into anything too gratuitous for the audience. In particular, the scene where Peter and Ellie share a room, Peter takes the time to set up a sheet as a partition which he calls the \"walls of Jericho\". It's reflective of a time that was more modest in nature concerning the roles and privacy between men and women. Throughout the film, those tropes are seen. The traditional manly role the Gable plays in constant collision with the ladylike personality of Colbert. The language of the film is also pretty mild. At one point in the movie Peter lashes out at Ellie and exclaims, \"If you do, I'll break your neck!\"  I would say this line hasn't aged well; however, it makes me chuckle to think of its irreverence. Other than the film is mostly upbeat in nature. There is a scene that I would say pushes the boundaries of what the Motion Picture Production Code set, but if I were to guess, It was just enough to not warrant any huge backlash. That scene is, of course, the piggyback scene. \n    In conclusion, I think the film was well done. The romantic screw-ball comedy mixes all sorts of witty lines with silly situations that display a classic \"fish out of water\" trope.  I don't think there was anything about it that was over-the-top, It was quite moderate in nature. That being said, I think it's the fact that this film comes across as the definition of \"playing it safe\". That is it lacks any ambition, and overall has nothing more than simply an enjoyable quality to it. Not great, but not bad.",

There were many examples where material was hidden to the audience, but still implied, which I thought worked and it seemed like the director was trying to \"stick it to the man\", while also trying to make a Hollywood style film.  Three main examples I saw were towards the beginning, when everyone was on the bus singing and dancing, a flask is handed to a man, but he begins to open it out of the frame, and you never actually see alcohol consumption.  Or when Peter went off to fight the man that gave them a ride, they both drive off and are out of the shot/scene, then Peter reenters, bruised and the man is gone, but he has the car and there was no real sign of a fight.  The final example, is when Peter and Ellie get back together and head back to the cabin, they had previously setup blankets to divide the room, but since they were married, it was \"ok\" for them to be together in the same room, and thus, the \"Walls of Jericho\" were able to fall.  Overall, this was a classic and pretty predictable movie, but with what was going on at the time and how strict of code producers had to follow, I think they did a good job.",

I'm talking It's a Wonderful Life Frank Capra! Yes, you're pretty treasured It Happened One Night, but not by me. In fact, I really didn't care for you.\nNow hang on It Happened One Night, before you get a twist in your toga, hear me out.  I don't necessarily think you're a bad movie. You've even made me laugh, like the time Clark Gable was trying to hitchhike and every car passed him by, and when Claudette Colbert gets the next one to stop by flashing her leg, but he turns out to be a robber that steals all their stuff? That was hilarious It Happened One Night. \nBut, if I'm being honest, you're getting old It Happened One Night. Dated. Clark Gable gives a stellar performance of a misogynistic, abusive man who falls in love with the woman he verbally abused the entire film. You're whole plot reeks of Stockholm syndrome. You may be treasured as a classic piece of cinema, but to me, you're nothing more than a representation of the times. And, like most romantic comedies, you will fade into the distant reaches of my memory. It may just be my 2019 brain, but you lack substance It Happened One Night. I didn't care if the character's loved each other, I was just flinching, waiting to see if Peter was going to become violent with his harsh words. \nYou're a fine piece of history, but in the end, that's all you are to me: history. History to learn from, to reflect upon, not with praise, but with cynicism. Seeing how women were treated in these types of movies prove that they do not stand the test of time. You're no exception It Happened One Night. That's why, upon my last viewing, I just couldn't help but cringe. \nI'm glad people love you, It Happened One Night, just know that I just can't be one of them.\nAlso, It's a Wonderful Life was mediocre at best. \nSincerely,\nIan\n",

The film comprises a mismatched couple who intend to rebel live against societal rules because of love. The film paved the way for numerous movies that adapted romantic comedy themes, setting a new pattern to romantic films. The director applies the idea of irony in several instances in the film. For example, the director uses situational irony technique when Peter claims that he is good at hitchhiking. He tells Ellie that he is can quickly stop a car and ask for a ride. However, when no car stops despite him sticking his hands out. But, Ellie does it instantly by lifting her skirt. The director shows that Ellie utilizes her feminine characteristics, which turns to be faster than they anticipated. The directors of the film, called It Happened One Night uses literary elements such as imagery to develop the themes of the film. One of the forms of imagery the director uses is the walls of Jericho. The wall of Jericho refers to the curtain that Peter hangs between their beds. The audience can see the two getting dressed either side of The Wall of Jericho. They know that they are in the same room, and they appear to be imagining the intimate and sexy image of the other without clothes. This image of two lovers on either side of the curtain seems to be a romantic one. The director also utilizes the idea of symbolism in developing some of the themes in the film. For instance, the relationship between Peter and nature symbolizes feeling alive and freedom.",

Ellen Andrews is a spoiled brat daughter of a wealthy businessman who is fleeing her overbearing father to be with her husband King Westley. Pete Warne is an alcoholic reporter who accidentally falls into arguably the largest story of his life. Although their love story is not traditional, they do show they care about one another throughout their journey from Miami to New York. The symbolic Wall of Jericho, especially the falling of it at the end of the film, shows the barrier that Pete puts between the two of them that eventually cannot hold back how they truly feel for one another. Everything they put each other through eventually leads to them getting together and arguably the line of the movie.\nFather Andrews: \"Do you love my daughter?\"\nPete: \"YES!!

Frank Capra is one of the great directors of the 1930s and 1940s and this is possibly my favorite of his films. The presence of Clark Gable was enough to tell me I was going to have a fun time, his rakish charm is undeniable, and Claudette Colbert is a great comedic actress. I expected to love this film going in and I really did, it's a very enjoyable watch and one of the more entertaining Best Picture winners.\n\nSpoilt heiress ,Claudette Colbert, has fallen in love with the repugnant King Westley, in an effort to escape her domineering but well-meaning father,,. Her father is vehemently against this and in his rage he slaps her causing her to run away from him, news that reaches all of the biggest newspapers in town. Working at one of these newspapers is Peter Warne, Clark Gable, a sardonic reporter who has his doubts about love. He is sent out to investigate an unrelated story but meets  by chance on the bus and sets out to get the inside scoop without her knowledge. What follows is a very entertaining series of misadventures during which the two fall deeply in love and the requisite last minute admissions of love are given with  running away from the marriage she no longer desires into the arms of Warne.\n\nThere are many iconic sequences in this film with Claudette Colbert revealing her ankles whilst hitchhiking, the singing on the bus, the \"Walls of Jericho,\" Clark Gable shirtless and the two lying in the hay being just a few of the hugely influential scenes. These scenes have served as an influence on countless future films, from Mystic Pizza (1988) to Bandits (2001), because they are endlessly charming, sexy and oh-so-romantic. Revealing Gable's chest was rather risquÃ (C) at the time and was no doubt a big excitement for the ladies in the audience but even today it's a sensual moment as Gable's swarthy beauty is revealed for all to see. The hitchhiking scene is also fun as we see them really work together for the first time and the punch line works just as well today as it did at the time of release. I could go on and on about why individual scenes have a special magic to them but I will try instead to talk about the men behind the magic Capra and  .\n\nThe screenplay is incredible as it is all things at once, managing to balance Gable's acerbic lines with Colbert's more starry-eyed romantic dialogue in the second act. It is this balancing act which it pulls of so well that makes it a near-perfect romantic comedy being equal parts romantic and funny. The big moments in the film, Colbert's tearful declaration of love and Gable's harsh rejection and Gable receiving the news that she will be marrying King Westley and not him, have the right amount of panache but they never veer into hysterics and always remain light enough to keep the audience happy and invested in the central couple. This screenplay and that of Nora Ephron's When Harry Met Sallyâ¦ (1989) are sacred texts within the world of romantic comedies and their authentic charm and sweetly romantic dialogue are lacking in lesser offerings like Bridget Jones's Diary (2001).\n\nCapra's direction is also key to the magic of the film as the movie rollicks along at a pleasant pace and we never spend too long on one scene. The film also looks beautiful with Colbert and Gable's faces luminous against the darkness of the night sky and the faces of the bus-goers captured with a sense of love. You don't expect great cinematography or â~visionary' direction in a romantic comedy usually the dialogue and the acting is far more important but here one of the greats displays his ability to keep an audience invested in an admittedly thin plot.\n\nThe actors are fabulous, they earned both Best Actor and Best Actress for their work, and their chemistry is powerful. The guy and gal who love each other but won't admit is a common trope, it's even present in Shakespeare for god's sake, despite this it doesn't feel stale here. Gable is handsome, charming and confident but he is convincing when his face falls at the news that he won't be marrying her and Colbert's expressive little face is delightful when she lets go of her hang-ups and joins the sing-along in the bus. Their witty back and forth is impossibly pleasurable to watch and I would have gladly spent a few more hours with this wonderful pair.\n\nThis was definitely, in my opinion, the best film of 1934 and the Academy should be proud for rewarding a production that has brought so many joy and that's popularity has rightfully endured.",

I enjoyed the performances and the script, and it's refreshing to see a film made at this time that has so much respect for women and their choices. The heroine gets to make her own decisions and figure things out for herself, she isn't just a pawn being moved round a board, and she gets a lot of great lines too.

The writing is strong and witty especially which is clearly visible when it offers a similar gravitas to the supporting cast to factor in on drama and comedy too. It isn't shot nicely and the camera work could have been a lot better but it surely is edited perfectly. The execution by Frank Capra is apt for the script and bodes well with the tone throughout the course of it as he keeps it light and breezy. Clark Gable is as always convincing on his portrayal and so has been Claudette Colbert on her parallel role with him as a bratty celebrity. The only missing puzzle is the stakes that are projected in here are taken lightly by the characters and the makers which clearly isn't feasible at all. It Happened One Night is a soothing and independent night if not appropriately taken hold of.",

Es una maravillosa cinta que se niega a envejecer y que posee un encanto irresistible. \n\nCuenta la historia de una heredera malcriada que huye de su hogar (Claudette Colbert) y un periodista desempleado (Clark Gable), quienes se conocen en un autobús y terminan enamorados. \n\nEsta premisa tan simple, producida por un pequeño estudio en ese entonces (Columbia Pictures), casi fue rechazada por sus actores. Sin embargo, \"It Happened One Night\" terminó convirtiéndose en un inesperado éxito comercial en plena época de depresión económica y hoy en día, en una de las favoritas de los críticos, pese al cinismo y la neurosis contemporánea.  \n\nLa dirección de Frank Capra y el guion de Robert Riskin, aprovechan cada uno de los detalles que hacen de esta película toda una delicia cinematográfica.  Sus protagonistas mantienen una química imposible de superar, el número musical de \"The Man in the Flying Trapeze\" es de un delirio mágico y la imposición de \"Los Muros de Jericó\", así como la demostración de Colbert de cómo parar un auto, son definitivamente inmortales.\n\n\"It happened One Night\" obtuvo 5 premios Oscar, incluyendo el de Mejor Película, Mejor Director, Mejor Actor, Mejor Actriz y Mejor Guión.

Gable is a newspaper reporter who's been fired.  They find each other on a crowded train, and are forced to sit together.  They hate one another at first, but after spending time on a couple of busses, a car, in the haystack together, and in a hotel room divided by a clothesline with a blanket hanging over it ... well, you get the idea.   At one point he carries her across a stream caveman style, over his shoulder, and gives her a swat on the behind as they debate what constitutes a piggyback ride.   They confuse each other's motivations and split at the end, Colbert off to wed another (and in a very pretty dress), but we all know where it's heading, and this one is complete with a 'runaway bride' scene.  \n\nI don't know if the movie was worthy of sweeping the Academy Awards (and Colbert herself didn't think much of it), but it's still sharp with its dialog, and quite entertaining.  Aside from the main story line, it has a nice 'Capra' touch in having everyone on a bus (including the driver) singing verses of 'The Man on the Flying Trapeze' to pass the time.   I also smiled over this interchange after Gable's character had tossed some newspapers off the bus to make space for his seat:\n\nBus driver: \"Oh, fresh guy, huh?  What you need is a good sock in the nose.\"\nClark Gable: \"Listen pardner, you might like my nose, but I do.  I always wear it out in the open, where if anyone wants to take a sock at it, they can do it.\"\n\"Oh, yeah?\"\n\"Now that's a brilliant answer.  Why didn't I think of it?

I am shocked that this is a classic and won so many awards- shocked, to an extent. I'm aware that society was ~different~ back then but I can't just ignore the blatant sexism prevalent in films from this time. In the same way that a racist movie would infuriate me beyond my ability to ignore for entertainment's sake, the disgusting misogyny in this film made it nearly unbearable. People say, \"it was a different time!\" but I don't care. It's disgusting now, it was disgusting back then, and no art/entertainment gets a pardon just because it was a hit when it came out.\nDespite this film having a female lead, she was nothing but a plot device. How the main character could make a total of ONE decision of her own within the span of an entire feature film is truly beyond me. Summaries of the film cushion the plot with things like, \"she agrees to help him if he keeps her secret\" but in actuality this was a woman on the run from a controlling father who was threatened with violence into giving that sleazy reporter a story or else he would give her up to that controlling father. Literally romanticized Stockholm's Syndrome. This is described as a romance movie but there was nothing romantic about it. This is a movie about men wanting a woman to do what they want instead of what she wants. The word \"demented\" popped into my mind multiple times while watching in reaction to things these men would do to her.\n\n\nThe characters were really annoying, all of them. The things that were supposed to be romantic were just gross. There must be a million ways to make a story about a runaway heiress, you know? It's an interesting premise but it was executed incredibly poorly, with totally unlikeable characters and multiple disturbing dynamics in play. Plot holes so enormous even the male lead's gigantic head would get lost in them. Professional appearance, decent sound, standard cinematography- not a particularly artistic film. Weak story, poorly told, no character development besides developing them from strangers to creepy, controlling jerks. I hope no bizarre situation occurs in which I am ever forced to watch this again.\n\n4/10\n\nBye love you",

There are tons of funny and obviously influential moments, from the train scene where Colbert sits next to an obnoxious guy and Gable pretends to be her husband so the guy will go away, to the hitchhiking scene where she flashes her leg so a car will pick them up. The story, while admittedly a bit bloated at times, is full of witty dialogue and powerful symbolism, with the \"Walls of Jericho\" metaphor being the most obvious and potent one.

The energy of the movie ebbs and flows between quiet, reflective scenes and manic energy as Colbert and Gable gradually transition from finding each other useful, to finding each other indispensable. Until their budding relationship is undone through misunderstandings that throw them back into old patterns.\n\nThe couple isn't separate from their environment, but lives in a populated world where people interact (for good or ill) and we see how people lived and traveled in depression era America. The dialog is sharp. The mores perhaps a bit more nuanced and less black and white than we might expect looking back with what we believe are more sophisticated eyes. All in all; a delightful movie that sneaks in a few jabs at society.",

If one wants to see old fashioned cinema that requires little thought and instead requiring your heart, then this is the perfect film to go to.\n\nThe film follows the collision of two individuals and the journey they both take together; one is a rich spoiled girl and the other a smart-ass opportunist. Many of its narrative elements are clichÃ© but I was able to forgive all that as it was written and directed very well, instilling humour and tenderness in many of its scenes. The events they go through together are simply entertaining to watch; how can one not enjoy the scene where the two leading characters are fake arguing with another in order to get out of a tough situation? The character development in this film is also spread out sporadically, allowing it to come off as natural rather than something forced.\n\nThe crowning achievement in this film is its chemistry between the two leads, Peter and Ellie. Watching them both together was such a delight; I could simply listen to the banter and the small looks they give each other for hours. Not all of the credit is bestowed upon the film's writers, as the actors that portray them on screen and allow them to come alive are also worthy of such praise.

            "content": "So this is what a romantic comedy was like in the 1930s. What we have here is the story of a young heiress (played by Claudette Colbert) who is frustrated with her overbearing father, and his threats to have her new marriage annulled. So she hops on a bus to go be with her husband. On the bus she meets a reporter (played by Clark Gable) who agrees to help her with her journey in exchange for an exclusive story. I always find it charming when I watch an old film like this and see how they handle the modesty of the times. The whole \"walls of Jericho\" thing was a lot of fun, and it paid off in a great way in the final scene. The pair of lead actors are just wonderful. I was surprised how Colbert was able to make her character so likable despite being spoiled rotten. Ordinarily that is a character type that I hate, but she was so sweet it didn't grate on my nerves. Gable is playing that lovable loser who just can't seem to catch a break but I always find myself wishing he would. He plays the heartbreak scenes so expertly and it pulls at your heartstrings because you can tell exactly what he is thinking behind those strong eyes.\n\nOne of the challenges in any romantic comedy is creating good chemistry between the leads, and I think they did that well here. Between the scene where they are pretending to be married, and the scene where they are trying to hitch a ride, I was laughing quite a lot, but also convinced they had a real connection. I think what didn't work for me is that this story is so familiar. Obviously It Happened One Night probably did it long before any of the others where I've seen a similar theme, so it shouldn't lose points for that, but I just think there have been improvements made in the genre. There were moments where I thought this movie dragged a little bit as well, and that's probably because I knew how things would end and I was just waiting for it to get there. That being said, there are a lot of iconic moments in this film, some that I had seen many times before without realizing they came from here. The acting was top notch, and there were a lot of funny moments too. I don't know if I'll ever revisit It Happened One Night on my own, but if someone asked I would gladly watch it again.",

It surely doesn't take a genius to notice that it's a mighty tall order to make a movie that would still be able to rise to the occasion after eighty years, but Frank Capra and Robert Riskin don't seem to have too hard of a time doing just that.

As the first film to win the Oscars grand slam, it also serves as the blueprint for every romantic comedy and screwball comedy that followed. It is hilarious, charming, and most importantly, very well made. At the time it was being made, no studio wanted it. Eventually, Capra received the go-ahead, Gable was cast as a punishment for being an annoying actor, and Colbert was assigned after the studio offered her twice her normal paycheck. Pretty soon, Capra was a household name, and this best picture winner was cemented in history. \n\nThe first half of the film is the best. Filled with one hilarious antic after another, the first half serves as a comedic travelogue that obviously inspired \"Planes, Trains, and Automobiles.\" The second half sinks into romance that started the predictable plot of every romantic comedy EVER!!! It should be the most interesting, but it ends up being the least, mostly because it was the first in a LONG line of romantic comedies. However, the acting is top notch considering the bribery, and the character development is lacking, but that doesn't have any effect on the film really. The plot is mundane, but the screenplay is excellent, taking the overall idea and twisting and turning it into many different directions and places, all with great success.\n\nUltimately, this is one of the great films of Hollywood, and certainly one of the best comedies. With its long line of memorable jokes and setups, this film shows that everyone involved has real talent, and that a little sophistication makes any humor all the more appealing, something modern comedies should consider. It was a blueprint for romances and comedies alike. It is a film where I kept looking at my watch and saw that the film was only just beginning, and then leaped with joy in anticipation of what great thing would happen next.",

The variety of scenarios these two main characters go through in a course of several days is just too unrealistic.  I know, I know....  I'm supposed to simply not look at this realistically, but simply go with the flow of snappy dialog and old-fashioned charm.  And, to be honest, I did sit through the entire film, compelled to see if there would be any detour to what I viewed as its predictable trajectory.  No such detour(s).  That said, there was a certain charm to the hamminess of the actors' performances, and slap-dash vignettes.  Reading the \"inside scoop\" of how this film inevitably came about (on Wikipedia) did give me more interest than I may not have had initially.

She finds herself hiding on a bus sitting next to down-on-his luck reporter Peter Warren, deftly played by wise cracking Clark Gable. The story takes off in funny and memorable predicaments for this unlikely couple. Both Ellie and Peter are fiercely independent with their personal goals on the line and yet they are forced to completely depend on each other. Peter is not about to let his lead story escape and she needs him to help her get to New York and \"Westley,\" the weasel husband she married in haste only interested in her money. In the meantime, an array of colorful characters including Ellie's father bent on annulling her phony marriage, help make this film a wonderful screwball comedy. This Frank Capra film is the original road trip story packed with a fast paced dialogue by Robert Riskin who won the oscar for best screenplay. Gable and Colbert also deliver great performances that garnered both of them Academy awards! The scene in which they are stranded off the road and Peter teaches \"Brat\" (Ellie) the art of hitchhiking is funny as he fails miserably, until cool and collected Ellie succeeds in stopping a car by lifting her skirt and exposing her leg. Clark Gable munching a carrot with his mouth full in a fast talking performance according to Friz Freleng and Chuck Jones of Warner Brothers cartoons admitted was the inspiration for another iconic character, Bugs Bunny! \"It happened one Night\" is sheer joy to watch and director Frank Capra is at his best. This 1934 gem is why so many other films that came later, copied and recreated famous scenes from \"It Happened One Night.\" With very little money, Peter and Ellie register as a married couple to get a room only to hoist a blanket between the two beds; \"the walls of Jericho.\" This is a classic scene and a turning point in the story for the two sparring characters who are falling in love. Even funnier is when detectives hired by Ellie's father close in on the couple at the motel and they improvise a domestic argument to fool them, only to burst out laughing when the coast is clear. \"It Happened One Night\" is the first film to win 5 Academy awards including Best Picture. It should be part of everyone's movie collection. It was released on January 1st, 1934 and after 80 years, \"It Happened One Night\" is still fresh, funny and a classic screwball comedy!",

Frank Capra made movies that you walk away from feeling great; it may tug on your heartstrings at times, but by the time 'The End' comes up on the screen, you're sure to have a big smile on your face.  This is actually the first Clark Gable movie I have seen, and I have to say I was impressed by his acting abilities; he overflows with natural charisma, and at times, he has the swagger and confidence of an assertive drunk.  He shares a perfect chemistry with Colbert, and when they're playing characters pretending to be someone else, it's magic; there's a bit where they pretend to be in an abusive relationship, and it is quite hilarious.  There is also the famous hitchhiking scene which has been parodied and spoofed a countless number of times, and that is worth the price of admission alone.  This is a wonderful, feel good movie.",

Clark Gable plays Peter Warren, a rough around the edges New York reporter, who is a perfect working-class foil to Claudette Colbert's pampered rich girl, Ellie Andrews. The two engage in an unlikely but charming romance, that is rife with intriguing tension. You can't help but root for Ellie's underlying desire for freedom and real love.",

The first hour is pretty brisk and mildly amusing, then in the middle there's annoying singing session from which it never really recovers. The none-too-strong plot rounds off with a telegraphed ending and there's really little that's particularly memorable about the whole film. 6.25/10",

Proving that once in a blue moon they get it right, the Academy awarded this whip-smart screwball comedy all five of the year's major Oscars. To modern viewers, the plot framework of It Happened One Night, which tosses together cynical reporter Clark Gable and snappy heiress Claudette Colbert on the run from her cosseted life, might seem like pretty boilerplate stuff, but you don't need a high concept when you're dealing with wit this sharp. And if its ingredients look familiar now, it's because It Happened One Night has been imitated so often. So beguiling is the story and so charming are the performances, it has the power to make romantics of the most hardened of hearts. Resistance is futile.",

            "content": "As you probably know, I love watching classic films and about 95% of the time, I generally agree with the general opinion about them. But in the case of It Happened One Night, I find it to be probably the most overrated comedy of all-time.\r\n\r\nWhat's the story? Well, a spoiled rich daughter (Claudette Colbert) marries wealthy King Westley (Jameson Thomas), a marriage that her father (Walter Connoly) objects to. She ends up escaping her father, by jumping off a boat, and travels to New York to have a life with Westley. But on the way, she runs into the drunken, and usually fired reporter Peter Warne (Clark Gable), who recognizes her and sees this as a chance to make a huge story out of it. But the more they're together, the more they fall in love.\r\n\r\nIt Happened One Night was directed by Frank Capra, who would later direct the wonderful drama It's a Wonderful Life and the powerful Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. Capra is one of the most acclaimed directors, and I was expecting a whole lot out of this film. But sadly, I didn't.\r\n\r\nOriginally, no one took this film seriously. Clark Gable was punished by another studio to do this film, and Claudette Colbert viewed the experience as \"the worst movie ever made.\" Despite a slow start, the film became an overnight smash and would even win Best Picture and it's other big four, Director, Actor, Actress, and Screenplay. The films It Happened One Night beat out for Best Picture was The Barretts of Wimpole Street, Cleopatra (no, not Elizabeth Taylor), Flirtation Walk, The Gay Divorcee, Here Comes the Navy, The House of Rothschild, Imitation of Life, One Night of Love, The Thin Man, Viva Villa, and The White Parade. The films that lost were probably much better than It Happened One Night. The fact that both lead actors didn't want to be a part of this film shows how disappointing this film is.\r\n\r\nWhy is it disappointing? First, it's not really that funny. I did get a chuckle out of me in a couple of scenes, such as the famous hitchhiking scene, scenes where Gable and Colbert pretend to be a married couple, and \"The Man on the Flying Trapeze\". But many of the jokes, such as the \"Walls of Jericho\", seemed dated and the film turned into a horrific melodrama in the second half. I didn't want a \"I love you. I don't want to lose you.\" kind of thing in a comedy. I hate it when a film like this changes it's tone by surprise. It usually never works, though it did in Sullivan's Travels, but that's different.\r\n\r\nClark Gable is an excellent actor, if you watch him in Gone with the Wind. While he's likeable here (especially if you're a woman and you like muscular bodies), but the \"cuteness\" didn't always work. Claudette Colbert, like  Gable, was likeable as well, but became really annoying in the second half. Everyone else did very little to make the film better.\r\n\r\nWhile I did enjoy some moments, I was let down by It Happened One Night. The comedy is bland, the acting is bland, and the fact that Hitler and Stalin loved this movie is a disgrace to Hollywood cinema, plus the fact that Gable's carrot-eating inspired Bugs Bunny (Bugs is much funnier, by the way.) Supposedly, this film inspired such comedies such as Bringing Up Baby, but Bringing Up Baby easily kicked It Happened One Night's butt. I suggest  you watch Bringing Up Baby instead.",
