            "content": "Call me crazy, but what was the point of making this? It kind of seems like the whole point of Pinocchio was circumvented just to be all weird and \"dark.\" But what it actually is... is annoying. There are musical numbers, and they are forgettable. About the only memorable part for me was the peg leg sailor and he was not enough to make sense of this unnecessary remake. I'm sure the original was just as preposterous, but tricking some wooden sentient horror into drawing on some worthless circus contract is obviously not a legally binding document. But I guess in a world where wooden demons run amok without being burnt or studied immediately you should forgive the obvious stupidity happening in all crevices. It has decent production value, but it is just so superfluous that I cannot say it is something you should spend your time on.",

I love the mature, dark twist! Although, I was confused by two details. Like, why Geppetto was so old when he was raising Carlo, or what happened to Candlewick. Besides that, this film was AMAZING!! Especially the ENDING!!! This film was a 2-hour-long, stop motion animated MASTERPIECE!! It was BEAUTIFUL!!! BRAVO!! BRAVO!!!",

Duas obras de arte que foram feitas de forma #majestosa e linda. Mas as duas s\u00e3o bem diferentes em suas #estorias #roteiro e #enredo e muito bem constru\u00eddos. A 1\u00aa tem uma ternura gostosa e envolvente. Agora qui ele e mais sombrio tanto que todo o desenho \u00e9 mais sombrio e escuro. Mas a sua artes, cores, fotografia e constru\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00e3o muito envolventes. Aonde temos o artes\u00e3o e escultor Gepeto com seu filho, mas quando est\u00e3o trabalhando em uma igreja um avi\u00e3o solta bombas e ela atinge a igreja e acaba matando seu filho. Ent\u00e3o Gepeto cai em um po\u00e7o sem fim de depress\u00e3o, se tornando um alcolotra. Em paralelo temos o grilo falante e em uma noite uma fada aparece e vendo a amargura de Gepeto da a vida a Pinocchio e incumbe o grilo de ensina-lo e vigia-lo. E Gepeto no inicio n\u00e3o o aceita bem porem com o tempo. Quando Pinoquio ia a escola, at\u00e9 que come\u00e7a a matar aulas e acaba descoberto por um dono de um circo ganancioso e malvado e tem seu mico do mal. Assim enganam Pinoquio, e v\u00e3o de cidade em cidade fazendo apresenta\u00e7\u00f5es e atr\u00e1s deles esta indo Gepeto e o grilo e acabam na barriga de um monstro marinho. At\u00e9 o momento que Pinocchio tamb\u00e9m acaba na barriga e reencontrando Gepeto eles conseguem fugir, porem o dono do circo quer vingan\u00e7a. E vemos o ato final. Muito emocionante e voc\u00ea esquece de que se trata de um desenho e parece real. Uma \u00f3tima fotografia, estoria, enredo e roteiro. Emocionante. E tem tamb\u00e9m o mundo dos mortos, mas Pinocchio n\u00e3o morre e toda vez que vai a este mundo ele retorna ao mundo dos vivos.\nRoteiro e enredo Magnifico Maravilhoso.\nVale apena assistir? Com certeza.\nNota: 9,25",

I also was bothered by the mix of ignorance - what is work? - to almost being a savant - immediately understanding what it means to be in debt and to work to send money back home. On the other hand, a positive was that physically Pinocchio stayed a puppet throughout - always himself.",

This version is told in a new mystical and darker way set in fascist Italy amidst World War II as the backdrop. Del Toro's imaginative take is full of visual splendors and wonder with its dazzling animation and effects. It also features a beautifully written score and songs by the film's composer Alexandre Desplat. Some of the highlights from the film include Pinocchio's song Ciao Papa, Geppetto's song My Son, and Better Tomorrows sung by Ewan McGregor who is the voice of Sebastian J. Cricket in the film. Guillermo Del Toro brings a fresh perspective on a well-known but creepy children's literature with visual flair, astonishing effects, and supported by a great voice cast. It is a remarkable masterpiece in animation.",

A visually stunning, thought-provoking, masterfully told piece of stop-motion animation that's dark, funny and darkly funny that deals with themes of death, mortality and rebirth and whose final scene genuinely hit me in the feels. Also, it's weird that we've had two Pinocchio films in 2022 that have poop jokes. At least here, the poop joke in question is relevant to the plot whereas the one from Disney's live-action remake only exists so that we can make memes insulting its quality. After spending years in development hell, Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio finally delivers a Pinocchio film that truly stands out without suffering the issue other Pinocchio films had about feeling insecure because of the high bar set by the Disney classic. Damn, 2022 really was a good year for stop-motion animation, wasn't it? And this certainly ended the year for the criminally underrated form on a high note. Whenever I feel insecure as an animation fan, because of that damned ghetto, movies like this and Puss in Boots 2 come along and I'm glad because they give me a reason to keep coming back. May 2023's batch of animated films continue this second renaissance of sorts for animation that began with Spider-Verse.\nP.S. There wasn't any room to mention it in the main review so I'll say this, the songs are nice. They're no Nightmare Before Christmas or even the underrated Corpse Bride, but they are pleasing to listen to and generally serve their purpose. \"Ciao Papa\" was the most memorable.",

Counter to the current trend in motion pictures from Hollywood; this adaptation dares to point to the past and take it a step further by honoring the original novel from 1883 in painstaking stop-motion capture. This frame-by-frame approach demands a story that holds up to the inevitable microscopic scrutiny. There's no room for fluff or filler. Guillermo Del Toro tells a story that sells itself because he knows that stop-motion capture can't cover up what feels cheap.",

La historia recuerda un poco a El Espinazo Del Diablo y El Laberinto Del Fauno por transcurrir despu\u00e9s de la primera guerra mundial durante el surgimiento del fascismo. Del Toro usa la f\u00f3rmula de esas dos pel\u00edculas ofreciendo una trama fant\u00e1stica con un aire metaf\u00f3rico y filos\u00f3fico sobre todo por la creaci\u00f3n de Pinocho que es como la resurrecci\u00f3n del hijo de Gepetto. El Pinocho de esta versi\u00f3n se asemeja al del cuento en su personalidad ya que se muestra testarudo e ingenuo, pero que a lo largo va aprendiendo lo que es ser un buen hijo. La animaci\u00f3n se lleva todo el cr\u00e9dito por su calidad artesanal y ser visualmente muy vanguardista ya que el estilo de Del Toro se le nota bastante. Esta pel\u00edcula es otra gran prueba de que la animaci\u00f3n no es solamente material infantil, la animaci\u00f3n en realidad es arte y un artista tiene toda la libertad de realizar su arte como le plazca. Esta pel\u00edcula es una obra de arte animada con una bella historia sobre la vida, la muerte, la juventud y la familia. Mi calificaci\u00f3n final para esta pel\u00edcula es un 9/10.",

            "content": "A tale as old as time since chipped onto the pages, Pinocchio represents one child's innocence that can be either taught out of pure love or manipulatively taken advantage of. But when imagining the wooden puppet's perilous journey of self-wonder and worth, it's imperative to emphaticize with him rather than being stuck through a potential creep show. Disney introduced their version considered a classic and acclaimed as definitive for generations to be introduced to the story in their childhoods. Memorably up top, while most other adaptations never capture such appealing magic because of the uncanny valley being brought to life which joins a portion of those that looked frightened over a living puppet in contrast to embodied purity that could only be rarely drawn just right. Though their live action remake doesn't really count since it's pretty much a CGI update with the narrative ridiculed but the heart remains. So, it's agreed that Pinocchio's story is best enjoyed just as told animated.\n\nDarkly creative filmmaking storyteller Guillermo del Toro conceptualizes a different medium that has yet to truly tell the story in another artistic direction, especially being more faithful towards the darker roots that surrounded the original tale. The stop-motion craftsmanship takes few years of painstaking perfection, which only presented on rare occasions, prolifically frequently through Aardman and Laika as their consistency releases a picture every few years. Even though the storyline offers an edgier differentiation, it would be insignificant if it wasn't told in stop motion since animated numerous times and imagined rather creepily on camera unappealingly. Del Toro apparently captured the true heartening essence with the production enabling actual interactions with the materials that helps connects with the characters than just projecting them. Unsure how much of the original tale is preferably told over different iterations as carriage of the messages it provides as supportive nurtures for growth, but the way del Toro read \"Pinocchio\" is truth, proving that grim fairy tales can still have much of a praiseworthy impact if told and embraced just right (experienced via \"Pan's Labyrinth\").\n\nGuillermo del Toro's \"Pinocchio\" fulfills its promise questioning our familiarity towards the story stemmed from certain sources with an elaborate character study that's been taken notice as each of their narratives been rounded to the fullest, particularly without restraining on certain topics stunningly visualized across appreciative boldness. Disney broadened their classic a bit hinting towards a larger story that's fully shown under del Toro's scope in the beginning serving as existentially thoughtful origins and the ending being differently fated under agreeably stylized continuation of Pinocchio's meaningful presence attempting to spell a speculated legacy afterwards \u2013 possibly stirring a folktale. On unfamiliar territory, it not only warms over the father-son dynamic prior to what we're used to but also thrills and eventually shocks in realization how it all falls. Then the conclusion prolongs as proper closing with subtleness also being a step backward-forward in prepping the eponymous character as finalizing his independence.\n\nThe essential core characters, with minor counterparts shifted differently, are well treated as this version is just as respectful from shared familiarity. Pinocchio, Geppetto and the Cricket (formally named Sebastian J. Cricket (SJC) in this picture) determines in what direction in defining a paraphrased narrative soul, positioning them as a test in getting this right aside from the structure that functions the same with events either seamlessly added or omitted. They not only provide freshness as they're written with humane realism in their behavioral motives just as (ironically) Pinocchio being a regular boy sought for love and curiously representing innocence borderlinking otherworldliness, SJC learning selflessness over his property from an observer's perspective, and Geppetto, being the most to sympathize, is a lost soul trying to feel what he lost again with silent declaration to cherish the time given under a second chance. Respectively, Gregory Mann, Ewan McGregor and David Bradley capture those characters exceptionally between recognizable profile and rawness towards realized definitive depths. Although, it may be factual considering its period, Geppetto's allegiance may be seen off-putting as it paints over his methods in dealing with his sudden rejuvenation in life, but reluctance is sensed and gets turned from acceptance over his blessing.\n\nAfter a decade of pre-production before finally bringing his vision to life, expressing his inspiration and personal connection, Guillermo del Toro's \"Pinocchio\" is a remarkable achievement, leveling as the best stop-motion film to ever witness over its painstaking delicacy by passionate enthusiasm, dedicated to the original storytellers that inspire us to tell stories just as they did. (To clarify, del Toro dedicated this to the memories of his parents, honoring their love poured into the father-son dynamic in the film). It stars a nice cast that acknowledges the classic and furthers its legacy through their performances contributing towards the titular boy's growth, then nicely touched by the music composed by Alexandre Desplat and the original songs arranged as counterparts to the known music through another adaptation. There's inevitable comparison plus competition to the earlier release of Disney's live action remake, but this has proven to be a direction that Disney should've accepted when updating one of their beloved masterpieces, which easily ranks this fresh take closer to that cherished classic. Artistically, it's the best animated film of the year by effort with a strong statement announced across its well-deserving accolades, while raising the impressive bar for its medium.\n\nIf you grew up with Disney's animated \"Pinocchio\", and it was probably how you were introduced to his story, it's possible that's more preferable to watch and still remains as more suited when introducing film plus the fairy tale with the attached message. It also aligns chronologically considering that del Toro watched that, inspired and been personally connected to what the film presented, hence his passion into embracing one fairy tale's original darker roots which he excelled in targeting the suggested audience than just grown-ups. Although those who admired his previous works would enjoy this more than children without any caution, whilst equipped with prior appreciation towards the medium. You have a classic to watch, then you have a broadened narrative with depth much closer to the original writings \u2013 and now realized less horrible than the donkey twist \u2013 backed up by the astonishing artwork.

I have never been a fan of other Pinocchio films or stop-motion animation, but I was blown away by this movie.\n\nThe story is new and inventive while also being true to the source material we all know. The movie is not just about a puppet whose nose grows when he lies. It is about the delicate and short nature of life and a father trying to cope with the loss of his son. The added depth of Geppetto's relationship with Carlo helped set the tone for the entire film.\n\nAllowing Pinocchio to start as a shell of Carlo and a burden to Geppetto is character development at its finest. While it is not the most rewatchable film, it is the best iteration of Pinocchio's tale that I have seen.\n\nBest Character: Cricket\nBest Scene: The final afterlife\nBest Quote: \"The one thing that makes life precious, you see, is how brief it is.\" - Death\nBest Song: Ciao Papa\nBest Piece of Score: Carlo's Theme\n\nAdditional Note: How in the world did Netflix release this film and Marmaduke in the same year?

This version is by far the best recreation out there, and I love the dark take on it. It's not ashamed to cover the dark side of Italy's government and children in World War 2, and it shows the time through a child's lens, which I thought was exceptionally clever.\nThere were a few issues, however, sometimes the songs lack and feel out of place, and during the whale scene in the end, there were a few moments I found myself chuckling instead of tensing up, as some moments were a bit goofier than intended. However, the strength of this movie I feel is the character design.\nThe characters are impeccable, and paired with excellent voice actors. Specifically, Death. Every scene she was in, I found myself marvelling at every ounce of her appearance. Her sister as well was absolutely beautiful, and Pinocchio's character looked and moved so well. There were so many incredible details to not just the character models that made me stop the movie just to look at them.\nThe animation in this movie puts Coraline and Kubo and the Two Strings to shame. Both I believe are excellent displays of stop motion, and this one just blew them out of the water with how smooth it was. From the first moment to the last, each movement was so fluid I actually questioned if they'd used motion capture. It's a visual masterpiece, that much is for sure.\nStory-wise, it's intense. I don't really know how much a kid would enjoy watching this due to the crazy paternal issues it covers. You will actually find yourself accepting that some characters are going to die in certain scenes, or that they'll never see each other again, just because of how incredibly well-done the tensity is. \nIt has its issues, but doesn't everything? I would highly reccommend this incredibly well-done movie, it's beautiful, fluent, and would impress any gothic-lover out there.",

I was particularly interested by the choice to not make Pinocchio a real flesh and blood boy, which emphasises that you don't have to conform to something to be loved, a theme throughout the movie. I also think the claymation (?) style really fit the serious but light tone and was amazing to look at. Especially pinnochio's design and bubbly demeanour. And I'll admit, I did tear up at the part where Pinocchio came back to life. Overall, I'd say this was a very enjoyable movie, much moreso than the Disney version.",

The Disney live action remake was, as is to be expected at this point, utterly worthless, serving only to remind you how good the original was, and how you should be watching that instead. On the other side of the coin, we have Guillermo Del Toro's long awaited passion project, a stop motion adaptation that, while not being a direct adaptation of Carlo Collodi's book, definitely leans more heavily into the material. This is the kind of Pinocchio film we needed to see, one that's not only beautiful to look at, but also dives into the dark side of the fairy tale, presenting the titular lead as well-intended but mischievous, friendly but rebellious, curious but gullible. Unlike the Disney remake, this one is a true morality tale where Pinocchio is exposed to the horrors of the world and afterlife and actually learns something. He finds out about the importance of family, of the dangers of trusting unscrupulous characters and, above all, of mortality. The time and location Del Toro's sets it in is perfect for the kind of story he's trying to tell, and it genuinely feels like you're going along on a grand and scary adventure with somebody who's acquiring knowledge and insight every step of the way. On top of that, the animation itself is beautiful, proving that, no matter how good CGI gets, it will never replace practical effects. In a year when we seen the worst a Pinocchio adaptation could be, we also seen the best it can be. Thank you Guillermo, we needed it.",

It reaches high level of sophistication with topics of death, which I chose to watch with my ten year old and about the beauty of life being a wonderful gift bestowed on us. I am slightly positively bias because I enjoy all of Guillermo's movies but if you have never seen one of his many masterful movies, this is a must watch. I also recommend watching the making of the film to appreciate even further the arduous work that went into making this fantastic movie.",

While I don't personally think it is the very best, I think it is among the best the genre has seen this year, especially since a lot of animated movies were a bit underwhelming this year. I have always had such an admiration for stop-motion animation as an art form and think this movie looks really cool the whole way through. I think this is a dark spin on the classic story and del Toro explores some really interesting and grown-up ideas here. For me, the movie did feel very bleak at times but I ultimately felt the emotions it wanted me to and was glad I experienced it. Overall, I think it is a feat from an animation perspective and an inventive enough spin on the story to justify its existence.",

Del Toro's passion for the project and his deep personal connection to the character makes it one of the most compelling adaptations out of the many that exist and also embraces some of the darkness of the original tale with themes such as grief, loss and war. It is visually stunning and unique with its stop-motion animation style and Alexandre Desplat's score and original songs are beautiful and disctinctive for the exclusive use of wooden instruments, and 'Ciao, Papa' is definitely going to earn quite a few noms. Also, the star-studded cast is flawless!",

Really? threatening to kill the main characters? Who is that doing anything for?\n\nOverall the more mature themes (not just the facism) were jarring, mostly didn't add anything to the film.

That's like having Concentration camps in Cinderella.  This is \"Pan's Labyrinth\" all over again.  Shoehorning horrible real world events in fantasy.  The stop motion animation is brilliant, pity that Geppetto stinks as a puppet maker as Pinocchio looks horrible and is basically named through the whole movie. Also, how old was Geppetto when he had his kid?  He looked 60 to 80 when Carlo was 10.  Then another 10 to 20 years pass for the pine tree to grow as big as it was when he cuts it down.  So is Geppetto like 100?  I love the stop motion but was there nothing in the budget for a younger looking Geppetto?  Just sayin'.",

I have not seen Robert Zemeckis' take on the character, but I've heard very bad reviews about this one, so I'd recommend this one in that case. I found this to be the best Netflix animated movie of the year, the best Netflix movie of the year, the best kids movie of the year, the best animated movie of the year, and so on. This is a really great film. If I had to name one thing I didn't like about it, it would be the villain, who is not charming at all and pretty flat.

Granted, the original serialized, sometimes picaresque morality tales by Carlo Carlodi in the late 19th century are dark, brief narratives with little cohesion as well (at the end of one, Pinocchio is hanged!) It's evidence that Del Toro was inspired more by those than by more rosy retellings. His heart is in the right place, but moving the story forward into Fascist Italy  is a less than an inspired move because it adds another heavy theme that threatens to overwhelm the less complicated marionette-into-boy themes. It could have been handled well if the people-as-marionettes subtext had been leveraged more adroitly, but for once, Del Toro seems to have missed an opportunity that was staring him in the face. The question of when human clay becomes a person is a big one, and it would not have been at all wrong to toss that against fascist dehumanization, but even the Candlewick moment falls flat as a son who can't please his father moment than what it might have been. In the end, the voice acting and casting is fantastic, the visuals are stunning, but the story wanders too far afield.",

            "content": "I did not like it much. Although the animation itself is fantastic, the characters: faces and costumes including scenography are all too dark. The original story on its own is already dark gray, now placing it all that close to the horror genre gives the entire movie a creepy feeling that is basically artificial, because it is adding virtually nothing to the story. The same with Mussolini's basically add-lib, it does not fit properly and gives nothing back. With all that the last third of the movie, once you try to ignore all above, gets the firmer consistency, but everything else is clumsy. I would expect animation to be clumsy not the story that is the extension of the original story.\n\nFor me it simply does not work. For example, the emotional connection to fascist Italy is too weak to evoke any true emotion, and the story on its own develops nothing there. Adding to that, Geppetto seems to be always in the same mood, just a few facial expression used, and other characters are equally one dimensional, which is maybe ok for that sort of animation, but it is kind of strange that they all look wooden when Pinocchio is made of wood itself. and the story is about a wooden puppet. I did not like it much and I will not watch it again. Horror elements must be used more carefully in any movie, and if they are not properly attached to the story, they look bad, because there is nowhere to go, you just have a creepy feeling and that is all that there is to it.\n\nEmotional background here is given by the cricket and a few quite pointless but very complex songs. It is too weak and as soon as it does not work, cricket is working in just a scene or two and ends up being hurt more than once, and songs are virtually not working at all, so there is nothing to change the constant emotional link between the characters that is evolving very little throughout the movie. The only that is changing the role is monkey but that is not enough in any sense.\n\nA few details are too close to blasphemy too, and I was afraid the the movie would start having that elements too, but fortunately this has been avoided. Still that feeling that I do not know what comes around the corner and how far the director would go, and Toro is able to go far enough, and the fact that it is still a story for children is giving it all a problematic aspect that I could not ignore. I just did not feel comfortable watching it and I did not get anything in return.",

A new take on this beloved character who we all have known our whole lives. The wooden boy who wants to be a real boy! But this new take puts the rehash elements to the side and gives us a dark origin story to Pinocchio. As he is brought magically to life and deals with the struggles to live up to his father's expectations. \n\nToro's Pinocchio has amazing stop motion. Scenes move fluid as it tells this complex story. The dark themes hit. Especially the beginning scene of Geppetoo and his son Carlo. The voice acting is very good here with Gregory Mann voicing Pinocchio. Who obviously steals the show as the movie goes on. I was very unsure at first but as the movie went. I started to enjoy this version of Pinocchio.\n\nGuillermo del Toro's Pinocchio is a good watch from the comfort of your very own home. Highly enjoyed and would for sure watch again. The story, acting and music in this movie are top notch. Might not be my favorite animation film of the year but it will for sure rank high on my list by the end of this year. \n\nGuillermo del Toro's Pinocchio gets a 4.5/5 \u2b50\ufe0f\nNow I have yet to see Disney's live action version of Pinocchio\u2026but I haven't heard the best.

Some big emotions for really young ones though.  \n\nI'm so glad that films like this are still being made. The collaboration between the Jim Henson company and Guillermo del toro had me glued to the screen from the first moments. It felt like some of the brilliant movies made for children and young adults in the 80s and 90s.\n\nSongs aren't that memorable but for me this isn't a big deal. I thought they mostly added and never felt they should have been left out. Bearing in mind the target audience here, the songs and humour were well enjoyed in our family.\n\nA film about imperfection, naivety, the darkness of the world, love, and friendship.",

Of course, the scene shows the character and the actor, as genuine as ever. When hesitating to send his wooden boy into the world, clutching his tiny gloved hand tightly and fighting back tears, Hanks is surprisingly moving as an animated co-star. As well Pinocchio must learn to follow his conscience, know right from wrong, resist temptation, and prove himself brave, honest, and selfless. His creator/father, Geppetto (Tom Hanks), and his caretaker, Jiminy Cricket (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), already model these qualities to make this movie a must watch.",

But I think Ewan McGregor was the stand out for me here, he's truly the heart and soul of this film and makes for a fantastic narrator. Each character feels layered and important within each story arc. \n\nThe animation is also absolutely superb. It was such a joy to look at and I love how creative it got at points. The animation always keeps the film interesting even if the story isn't in the moment, which is rare here. The visuals and animation are some of the best this entire year have had to offer, and it's definitely a lock for at least a nomination for best-animated feature at the Oscars. \n\nOverall I was blown away by this one, it falls into some convenient moments and cliches but overall this film stayed centered and delivered a deeply emotional and moving story. Del Toro absolutely outdid himself here and it's definitely my favorite animated film of this whole year. This is easily the best version of the Pinnochio story we've ever received.",

Reinstating a tragic back story to David Bradley's Geppetto and re-setting the film now against Mussolini's fascist Italy in the 1930s, Guillermo del Toro and Patrick McHale's cinematically literate and informed screenplay remains faithful to Carlo Collodi's book, but with the theme of death and loss placed firmly at its core, and re-imagined through del Toro's horror-tinged lenses, this becomes a fresh and visually stunning re-telling of a familiar story layered with tensions and fantastically grotesque creatures like the redesigned Dogfish or the beautiful yet scary Wood Sprite/Death which have del Toro's signature all over them. Ewan McGregor's amusingly pompous Sebastian J. Cricket brings unexpected comedic moments to a barely PG film whose Pinocchio, voiced by Gregory Mann, is now fused with the DNA of Frankenstein's monster, while Stromboli morphs into Christoph Waltz's Faustian Count Volpe and Paradise Island is transformed into a military training camp for young soldiers. Gorgeously rendered via stop-motion (and a frontrunner for best Animated Feature at this year's Oscars), it has colour palettes and textures that contribute to make everything looks amazingly sumptuous with thoroughly thought out production designs and details that will reward repeated viewings. Together with Alexandre Desplat's lush, lullaby-like score and a few musical numbers that feels organic to the altered storyline, what we have here is a complex and nuanced film with a much darker and more idiosyncratic tone. It certainly is a long way away from Disney, and for once, all the better for it.",

            "content": "I just finished watching \"Guillermo Del Toro's Pinocchio,\" and it was by far the best adaptation I've ever seen. I'm not being unduly melodramatic when I say it's almost perfect; rather, that's how I feel about it. We are all familiar with Guillermo Del Toro's \"alchemic\" storytelling style, which gives fantasy and horror movies a richness of emotion and theme. His use of storytelling is demonstrated in this movie. In addition to The Shape of Water, Pan's Labyrinth, The Devil's Backbone, and Cronos, he created a lot of my favorite movies. I think his Pinocchio will be featured as well.\n\nIt's not the same story that Disney gave us to know and love. I've seen several different retelling of this tale, and I'll be honest: I didn't like Disney's live-action adaptation. But this version is one of the greatest I've seen thus far. It's pretty dark, gritty, violent, yet emotional with tons of heart. After watching the Pinocchio movie, I was feeling a wide range of emotions at this time. Despite being a fantasy movie, Del Toro infused reality to the story, which is why I enjoy it. Pinocchio is a wooden puppet that, as everyone knows, comes to life and sets off on a journey to discover what it takes to be a real boy before really becoming one. Despite being a puppet, he is depicted in this version as a young child already who is learning about the harsh truths of life and how merciless and unforgiving the world can be. As well, the fact that adults are not always the finest role models for us is another thing he is learning. And as a result, we saw a boy's adjustment to his surroundings as well as his eventual development into a person who is more humanitarian than others.\n\nThis adaption captures the realistically bitter-sweet relationship between a child and parent, which is something that most people can identify with. This is relatable to adults, simply grownups, and even parents. It is not just for children. Additionally, it demonstrates that not all kids and parents are flawless and that sometimes we can be callous and unkind. However, it is up to us how we choose to react, which makes this adaptation incredibly humanistic.\n\nI also have the utmost respect for Alexandre Desplat, who composed the soundtrack and original song for the movie. I can absolutely see myself listening to it more regularly because it is masterfully written. The fact that stop-motion animation was used for every single second of this film is another appealing feature. This is without a doubt one of the greatest works of stop-motion, a rarefied and irrational art form that allows him to preserve the texture of his live-action work while controlling the appearance of everything in the frame.\n\nA fair warning that this movie can be too intense for children to watch, and I strongly encourage adult supervision, but in a way. However, in a way, this could be fun because the movie has the potential to be both funny and moving. When the credits started to roll after seeing this movie, I was brought to tears and overwhelmed with wonder. It drastically changed how I saw the concept and realization of an individual having emotions and thoughts by reflecting from this movie.",

Easily better than the version Disney put out this year! The movie is exquisitely crafted. It's visually stunning, the stop motion is perfect and some of the best I've ever seen, plus the actual lighting and cinematography is gorgeous (as usual for Del Toro). I loved the design and look of the characters and sets, and creates such a unique atmosphere alongside Desplat's stunning musical score (and some great songs). It had a sort of \"Luca\" vibe to it that I really liked (although this is better). I loved how Del Toro told the classic story of Pinocchio that we all know, but wasn't afraid to delve into the darkness of it. The characters were all very distinct and memorable, and all bright to life by some excellent vocal performances from an all star cast! The standout to me was easily Ewan McGregor's Cricket, but I also really loved the casting for Pinocchio and Geppetto. Their relationship is the core of this film; it's both heartwarming and heartbreaking as Pinocchio wrestles with his conscience and emotions. The film is a remarkable piece of art that captures the horrors of fascism and celebrates the relationship between father and son. The animation, music and storytelling are all top notch making this an unforgettable cinematic experience. I highly recommend this, although it may not be as kid friendly as the Disney version is\u2026 this one is much more mature; it's both dark and whimsical at the same time! (Animation is not just for kids! It's a form of art; a form of storytelling, and this proves it!) Check it out on Netflix, it's easily one of the best animated films this year! It's pure magic!",

The voice cast was very selected, and the musical element of this movie was often sporadic and short lived, which actually accentuated the narrative rather than driving it, I think many children's film makers could learn a thing or two from this style of musical film making. \nThe stop motion was masterful, and the character's and set designs were both breath-taking and rather left a sort of sadness to all of the characters. The setting was changed slightly and that change added to the overall sad nature of a wooden puppet who seemingly can't die. \nSurprised at how much I enjoyed this as a fan of classic myth and legend, definitely one to watch",

Not even a new born baby.\n\nIt's a bit far of the real story but I still love it.\nI love the way Pinocchio is so contend by being himself. Carlo is kind of sheepish in comparison. Pinocchio just suddenly comes to life, and he know very little about the world. He don't really know what's good or bad from the start, because nobody explains it to him and assumes he should know all about anything, in spite of \"he just got here, wtf\" attitude. It's hilarious. But he don't know better. Discipline won't help on this wooden kid. But he evolves all the way as a boy do. Or any person would.. \nI se what the original story wanted to tell: Behave and do as you're told. But Pinocchio by del Toro tell it differently: Be who you are and never stop learning.\nSo with this wonderful Pinocchio. He can't help he don't know what fire is. He just got there.\n\nAs for wooden people, this Pinocchio certainly not one. Heads op, this is the new Christmas movie for me. \nThis is a puff of freshness to an old story.",

If given more free expression in this regard, as opposed to dampening the essence of his stories with visual style, they might one day make a truly great del Toro film.\n\nPinocchio is not a bad film, but del Toro didn't direct it so much as exert suffocating and ubiquitous control over it. Whilst evenly paced, this feature is too long with its take home messages overplayed with conceited and misplaced symbolism and metaphor. There is no appropriate metaphoric similarity between the crucifixion of Christ and the loss of Geppetto's son, or the misadventures of his creation, Pinocchio. The musical numbers come across as contextually misplaced too because it's not a Disney film, and they're pretty flat anyway. \n\nThe characters occasionally feel only tenuously linked as well; as though some scenes were there to serve a  purely by-the-numbers approach to storytelling. Where their respective scenes should make them more cohesively involved and essential to the story's themes, they feel vaguely disparate and empty. In particular is the flat but inoffensive comic relief of Sebastian. He really doesn't seem to serve any other purpose and is basically not significantly involved as a moral compass for Pinocchio, yet is able to claim his wish to resurrect Pinocchio because he told him to do his best. Hmmm\u2026..right. \n\nThe nods to fascism are misplaced too. Were they intended to serve as metaphor for toxic father-son relationships? Or intolerance toward individuality, and accepting people for who they are? Or just plain old bad parenting? Who cares, it's too heavy handed either way and detracts from the heartfelt and simple messages so flawlessly conveyed in the 1940s original, about the importance of being true to yourself and others. \n\nI can't say I know who the intended audience for this is either. It's okay for kids but it's themes like coming to terms with death and loss are not exactly going to entertain them. As for everyone else, well if you've seen the 1940s version, (and much like del Toro's Nightmare Alley remake too) then there's really not much to recommend.",

First off, the stop motion animation looks absolutely spectacular and is easily the best animation from a film that I have seen all year. I desperately hope this wins Best Animated Film at the Oscars this year. Del Toro made a great decision when he decided to set the film against the background of the start of WWII and the rise of fascism as the film's core message talks about staying true to yourself regardless of what other people or leaders think of you or how you look. The story does take some creative liberties here like removing anything to deal with donkeys and pleasure island and instead replacing them with an Italian Youth Camp which accomplishes the same goal and after having a bunch of Pinocchio adaptations recently a change of setting is very much appreciated. The voice acting from everyone is great especially Ewan McGregor, David Bradley and Gregory Mann. Mann and Bradley especially have some great chemistry together and Mann has a beautiful singing voice. All of the characters are interesting to follow especially Christoph Waltz's Count Volpe who was one of the more interesting characters presented here. The score from Alexandre Desplat is whimsical and wonderful while also having that dark element in there which compliments the tone of the film greatly. The humor also tends to land a lot here as there were many jokes and moments that got me but the film also leans into its darker setting a lot as well with some very heavy scenes here and there. This is easily the best animated film to come out of 2022 so far so definitely check it out.",

Now I'm a fan of the 1954 Pinocchio, and I'll say right off the bat that this is not a remake! Don't be foolish and think that, because this is an adaptation of the book more than anything. This movie took some creative liberties, some really good creative liberties, in fact. The movie is set during World War II, in an Italy under Mussolini. War plays a huge role in this film, and I think Del Toro did a good job of taking the basic ideas from the original story, and expanding on them. For example, a certain island setting from the original story is not present in this film, but in its place is a genius substitute that serves practically the same kind of purpose in a way. Every character is interesting and the worlds are very dense with details. While having a dark tone, the movie also finds a way to be upbeat and charming at times. Also, the music is great, the musical songs are pleasing to the ear. Best of all, the visuals are stunning, the puppets capture emotion even though they're puppets. This movie beats Disney's remake by a long shot, and I hope it gets lots of credit for that. Watch this movie if you like the story of Pinocchio, but expect differences and a darker tone. Your kids will like it, and you will love it. 10/10 totally recommend.",

With the countless fairytales that have existed, I understand the appeal to return to the proven classics, but I feel like Pinocchio needs a break.\n\nThis is already the fifth adaptation of the little wooden boy (just since 2002). I'm feeling a little fatigued, even with a film as beautiful as this. Don't get me wrong; this was a different take in some aspects, but it's still the same story at its core.\n\nThis was a beautifully animated film with some twists from the previous versions I've seen (but you can only go so far from the source material while still claiming it's a retelling.) The voice cast was phenomenal; I instantly recognized so many voices in a way that helped solidify the film. I became used to McGregor, Swinton, Waltz, etc., as these characters, in some way, their real-world personas (while not the same), helped you become part of this mystical world.\n\nIt seems to be a popular storytelling device to \"tell a new story\" through the eyes of another character. While that sometimes works, I think it traditionally needs to be more of a departure from the original to work well. I'll never question del Toro's directorial abilities; even in stop-motion, it comes through. He has a style that is easy to describe but hard to explain; most of the time, you know, when you're watching one of his films.\n\nI will say this isn't necessarily a \"children's\" version of the film; it's darker in tone than some that have come before it. In reality, most fairytales are far darker than their film counterparts.\n\nFor more reviews and my YouTube channel, please visit linktr.ee/Overlyhonestmoviereviews\n\nFollow me on Letterboxd, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube.

Del Toro shows that what most stories don't, the beginning before Pinocchio and how Gepetto lost what was most precious to him.\n\nDel Toro shows perfectly and beautifully how the world isn't perfect, and neither are the characters. Mistakes, faults, regrets, addictions, and even mister grasshopper, the conscience of Pinocchio, that isn't what you think he would be at the end.\n\nEven del Toro has made Pinocchio more dark toned, it still has the many moments of dry humor, that will make the story lift up from its darker pages. This, in combination with the characters, and all other aspects, makes it a memorable journey, and even you thought you knew the story, many moments will surprise you, as does the ending.\n\nThe half star I took away, is one that I think made the story somehow too heavy. The world war two theme that arises now and then, gives a strange feeling of uncomfortability. One in which Pinocchio is a questionmark. Even the creativity is amazing with this theme, the darker tone of WW2 and the death of many, makes it like the movie is taking a choice to the wrong side. It leaves a feeling of contradiction in not knowing how to feel about, amazing or terribly wrong. Maybe a bit of both. And maybe that's the purpose of del Toro too. \n\nNevertheless, the movie is a gem and I appreciate del Toro's achievement in unlocking Pinocchio from its stranglehold of Disney. Refreshing, beautiful, dark. Well done del Toro.",

It is not just a simple rehash we have seen multiple times but offers a more profound tale. Additionally, it delivers a multi-dimensional story about father and son. Moreover, it is a much darker tale that tackles gritty and mature themes. This film finally delivers an origin story for Geppeto, showcasing his life as a father before tragedy hits, thanks to the war brought by Mussolini. The voice cast is outstanding, but the stand out is Ewan McGregor, who narrates the entire film as Pinocchio's ally. His delivery has so much heart and soul, which delivers a tone that will tug at heartstrings. This stop-motion visual is a cinematic masterpiece with plenty of charm and creepiness to keep you engaged. It is complemented by a soundtrack that will make you smile as it takes you on a father-son journey. The close to two-hour runtime is the only thing holding it back from perfection.\n\nI give Guillermo Del Toro's Pinocchio 4.5 out of 5 stars. It is a refreshing departure from what we have seen a million times about a wooden boy with no strings attached. Start streaming it on Netflix on December 9th.",

The story is deeply moving as Pinocchio, voiced by David Bradley, struggles to stay true to his father Gepetto's wishes while also trying to find his path in life.\n\nThe animation style is unique for a del Toro film, blending elements from his other works to create something entirely new. The colours and visuals are stunning, giving justice to the grim world of 1940s Italy.\n\nThe characters are distinct and memorable, each brought to life with the help of excellent vocal performances. While Gepetto and Pinocchio take centre stage, their relationship is the true star of the film. The relationship between this father and son is both heart-warming and heartbreaking as Pinocchio wrestles with his conscience and emotions.\n\nThe music also adds to the atmosphere, creating an additional layer of emotion that helps bring the story together.\n\nGUILLERMO DEL TORO'S PINOCCHIO is a remarkable piece of art that captures the horrors of fascism and celebrates the bond between father and son. The animation, music, and storytelling are all top-notch, making this an unforgettable cinematic experience. Highly recommended! (NOTE: Parents, take care. This might not be the most suitable movie for young children.)",

This doesn\u2019t take away from the movie earning class status to an adult audience, but it is not the a movie that your child is going to want to see over and over other classic fairytale movies.\n\n95 out of 100",

Interesting characters, great settings. Kind of fun having Pinocchio look like an actual wood carving. All the characters are done well. Small deviation is this is set in fascist Italy, so we do see war and Mousillini. Goes a little long. Pinocchio is an annoying boy throughout the movie - not really picking up the life lessons he's being put through. My only annoyance is I have no love for Ewan McGregor - but luckily his voice isn't around too much.\n\nWorth the Theater visit while you can. It's a Netflix production, so will be streaming soon, but the graphics and imagery deserve to be seen on the big screen.",
