    "summary": "Slow-witted Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) has never thought of himself as disadvantaged, and thanks to his supportive mother (Sally Field), he leads anything but a restricted life. Whether dominating on the gridiron as a college football star, fighting in Vietnam or captaining a shrimp boat, Forrest inspires people with his childlike optimism. But one person Forrest cares about most may be the most difficult to save -- his childhood love, the sweet but troubled Jenny (Robin Wright).",

            "content": "There's a scene in Forrest Gump that encapsulates the film. Jenny, who is dying from an STD, asks Forrest if he was scared in Vietnam. Forrest then tells Jenny about the stars in Vietnam, the sunset he saw from the shrimp boat, and the mountain lake from his cross-country run. Forrest even mentions a desert sunrise so stunning that he didn't know \"where heaven stopped and the earth began.\" \n\nForrest sees the beauty in everything. He took a question about fear and spun it into poetic gold. This is why we love him. His attitude and childlike wonder towards life represents humanity at its best. Something to aspire to. Based on the novel by Winston Groom, and adapted by the amazing Eric Roth, Forrest Gump is an opus about the power of optimism and how to endure life's pain. Forrest Gump masterfully depicts the hero's journey with amazing plotting and structure. It's a journey I want to take time and time again. \n\nRobert Zemeckis is a pro storyteller and crafts each scene with the right amount of humor, nostalgia, intensity, and human emotion. The framing device of Forrest telling his story is perfect. We get to live inside Gump's head and see a heightened version of reality from his mind's eye. It's a dream, fairy tale, magic trick, and memory all in one. \n\nForrest Gump grew up in Greenbow, Alabama during the 1950s. Zemeckis paints Greenbow with Norman Rockwell idealism. Childhood is a time of wonder but Zemeckis doesn't let us live there Scott free. Forrest has to deal with a single mother, a low IQ, leg braces, and bullies. Zemeckis is genuine about the story he's telling. Only a director that earnest can pull off a joke about Mrs. Gump banging the school principle and make it work. \n\nAll of these characters come from a place of Southern Boomer love and affection. The genius of Forrest Gump is the contrast between Forrest's naive innocence and Jenny's cynical life crisis. We get two opposite journeys in one. Forrest is the vanilla protagonist and audience stand in. He's an ordinary man who experiences the extraordinary. Forrest Gump is wish fulfillment. He's a country boy that sees the world. He's the feather that floats in the wind. \n\nForrest isn't focused on the destination, he's just in love with the journey. His heart may pine for Jenny and Greenbow but Forrest makes the best of where he is. He embraces the now. James Cameron once said that a movie doesn't have to be possible it just has to be probable. The byproduct of Forrest's low IQ and social awkwardness is that he has extreme focus. He can assemble a gun and play ping pong better than anyone. He can run from coast to coast and keep a pace. \n\nForrest pops up in so many historical moments that we half expect him to reveal the Watergate scandal that led to Nixon's resignation. This explanation is enough for the audience. In the army, Forrest finds a second family. Bubba becomes a brother to Forrest. \"I gotta find Bubba\" is the ultimate heartbreaking plea. Lieutenant Dan becomes the mentor and father figure that Forrest needs. Dan is a no nonsense bad ass who challenges Forrest and grows to respect him. \n\nThere's a scene where Forrest is recuperating at a VA hospital by enjoying ice cream. This moment is interrupted when Forrest receives a stack of \"Return to Sender\" letters that he sent to Jenny. This is classic Zemeckis. He gives you bliss one moment and breaks your heart into a thousand pieces the next. With Zemeckis we never know what we're gonna get.\n\nLieutenant Dan goes through the crazy character development that Forrest doesn't. After getting both his legs amputated, Dan becomes a shell of himself. He's a cigar-chomping drunk with a crisis of faith. He hates that Forrest saved his life. Dan has a lot of reinventing to do. When Forrest buys a shrimp boat, Dan agrees to be his first mate. \n\nThere's an amazing scene where Forrest and Dan survive a hurricane. When the storm clears, the duo have more shrimp then they know what to do with. Peacefully floating in the water, Dan thanks Forrest for saving his life and then makes his peace with God. Dan gets new legs and a new lease on life.\n\nJenny spends the whole movie running from her demons. She tries to fill the void left by her abusive childhood and only half succeeds. She returns home to Greenbow but she's not ready to stay. She's not done running. Forrest is crushed and the only way he can deal with his pain is to run. He runs for three years and eventually his heart begins to heal. \n\nWhen Forrest sits at the bus stop at the beginning and end he's wearing the old pair of Nikes that Jenny got him. To Forrest, the little things in life are the big things. At the end of Back to Future, Marty is rewarded with a better life. Some people don't like this ending but this is classic Zemeckis optimism. Forrest goes through hell and he gets rewarded for it. This is the hope of the film. We want to believe that every disadvantage contains an equal or more powerful advantage. We want to believe in the spiritual concept that all things work together for the good. \n\nWhen Forrest reunites with Jenny it's the healthiest we've seen her the whole movie. She has finally found peace. At the end, Forrest walks his son to the bus stop and the movie comes full circle. Zemeckis doesn't just wrap a present, he puts a bow on top. 1994 was a great year for film and against distinguished competition Forrest Gump won six Academy Awards including Best Director, Best Screenplay, and a second Oscar for Tom Hanks. \n\nIs Forrest Gump really that good? I believe it is. Alan Silvestri composed an amazing score and the film features a remarkable song list from the 1960s and 1970s. Forrest Gump may not be for everyone but it hit me right where I live. Robert Zemeckis and Eric Roth's ode through 20th century America is as sweet as a box of chocolates. And that's all I have to say about that.",

            "content": "Undoubtedly, one of the greatest films of all time, Forrest Gump, does everything well. The cinematography and visual effects are great; there was nothing that made me question the director's choices. It's a touching story about Gump's journey through life as a disabled man who is also incredibly dutiful, hardworking, and, in some ways, wise. He never complains, and he just does, and I honestly like that way of life, which is simple and fulfilling. The story is mostly that of a slice of life because it's quite literally just Gump's life, but there is also a lot of drama, action, and history throughout the movie, which is why I think anyone can watch this movie and enjoy it. The characters were written beautifully. Many people seem to despise Gump and Jenny's relationship, but I believe it is one of the most profound love stories ever written. Juxtaposed, the two characters are very different people who go down very different routes in life. In the end, they finally get together, even though they have clearly loved each other for a long time. To analyze the relationship between the two would take a whole essay, but trust me, it's a tear-jerker. The performances by all the important characters were also great, but especially Tom Hanks, who plays Gump really well; he really came off as authentically disabled.",

The VFX are incredible, as well as production design and every other technical detail, such as editing. Man i miss a score like this one, so iconic and with so much emotion.

            "content": "Forrest Gump is my favorite movie of all time. Over the course of the film, you watch Forrest Gump's life. You watch young Forrest go from leg braces, to by the end of the film, running around the country for three years straight (literally), as well as pretty much everything in between. Seriously, the man plays for two different sports, serves in the military, becomes a shrimp boat captain, invests in a company that makes him a BILLIONAIRE, and a whole lot more. The thing that has always stood out to me about Forrest is his unshakable view of the world. As narrow and misunderstanding he may be, he sure does have a beautiful look on life, and it all pays out in the end. I have very seldom ever found myself tearing up during a film, but this film sure nails the emotions it wants to project to its audience. Forrest Gump will make you happy, sad, scared, disgusted, angered, laugh, and everything in between. This film is a very well-rounded story and the performances from the whole cast are extremely believable and makes you ever more invested in the events that the movie welcomes you into. I would be remissed if I did not give praise to the film's incredible editing. The film spends a lot of time showing famous events in the world's history and does a fantastic job of editing Forrest into the real clips in an awe-inspiring way, which just further invests me as a huge fan of world and American history. From exciting cameos such as Elvis Presley, John Lennon, and JFK, to amazing recreations of events like the guerilla warfare in Vietnam, this movie was not very short of perfection in integrating history into the movie's plot. Last but not least, this movie told a very intriguing love story. Jenny and Forrest are lifelong friends. During the whole movie, Forrest romantically pursues a relationship with Jenny, while Jenny is confused and is very on-and-off with her feelings towards Forrest. When he tells her that he loves her, she replies \"Forrest... You don't know what love is\". That moment perfectly describes they're entire relationship. Although he may be misunderstanding about things, and may be confused at points in his life, he's always known that he has loved Jenny. Jenny has been traumatized her whole life and is not ready to love until the very end. I am serious when I say that the last five to six minutes of the film are really a tearjerker with some of the most beautiful lines of dialogue I've ever heard in a film. Overall, this film is a masterpiece to me and it doesn't get much better than this. I totally recommend if you have not seen it already.",

To begin with, Tom Hanks gives a very good and unforgettable performance in this film. Tom Hanks' role, Forrest Gump, is a plain and slow-witted country kid. We learn about his life, his everyday sayings that help him get by, and how he casually participates in some of the most major events of the 1960s. it's Simple, yet nice. It's a touch too direct and emotional for my tastes, but it's powerful. It's not profound, but it's rather pleasant if you don't think too hard about it. It's amazing to watch how true historical events are mixed into the storyline and film, and it also adds a brilliant humorous element to the film. It's a beautiful film. due to historical truths and a pleasurable experience It's a beautifully created work of art. for the film's cast members' one-of-a-kind performances It's a fantastic story in which the good guys win. Be open to the ideals of the time period as well as the unique and pleasant sense of humor.\n\nIf I had to add anything, I would advise people who are easily triggered by historical events to avoid certain parts of the film because historical events are depicted in the film, primarily flashbacks to the beginning that do not come across as kind when it talks about the Ku Klux Klan (Ku Klux Klan), and I would also suggest hiding some scenes from children because there are scenes that suggest a sex event is about to occur. and includes scenes of bulling and battles that may not be suitable for all viewers. However, you must be of mature to comprehend and accept some ideas till then. You'll also need a sense of humor to appreciate Gump's activities.\n\nAs a result, I would recommend that people watch this film because all of the cast members give outstanding performances. The story above, in my opinion, underlines the most important messages that we should all remember throughout our lives. Instead of focusing on your weaknesses, examine your opportunities. Make the most of what you've got. Always give your best effort, respect others, and be willing to learn from others. This will be a wonderful movie for you if you can dig all of the stuff I described earlier and go with the flow. You must be in the right mood and state of mind to enjoy it because this film will truly fully immerse you.",

            "content": "Warning: Spoilers\nForrest Gump, I think is a beautiful film. Never too schmaltzy, but there are some genuine tearjerkers like Forrest at Jenny's grave. The cinematography is stunning, the costumes are lovely and the scenery is gorgeous. The music is also very calm and relaxing, perhaps adding to the tone of this film. The screenplay is well crafted, and the story is simple. But what made this movie was its simplicity; it never tries to be too complex and is consequently moving. The acting is just as impressive; whilst Tom Hanks's accent is a little awkward in places, my only real criticism of this movie, he gives a truly remarkable performance, though I do think Morgan Freeman deserved the Oscar more for Shawshank. Robin Wright gives possibly the best performance of her career, and Sally Field is very dignified as Forrest's mother. The scene stealer though is Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Dan, a very moving and insightful performance. Overall, an extremely good movie, I will admit I wasn't sure whether I would like it, but the simple answer is this, I do. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "It's not every day that a movie released will still maintain relevancy nearly three decades later, but Forrest Gump has proven itself to be a timeless movie and a blockbuster of its time. I have watched this movie numerous times and have somewhat of a habit of going back and watching this movie at least once every couple of years. I love the way that Forrest Gump's story is told by Forrest's naivete so that throughout the story we can infer what happened through the imagery and inferences. To those who are on the fence about watching this movie because it looks like it would be dull, I urge you to reconsider. This movie is extremely close to what I would consider being a masterpiece of its time due to the versatility of the scenes, the story that it wistfully guides you through as if you were spectating Forrest Gump's life in real-time, and my favorite part of this movie, the character development.\nThere is not much more that I enjoy in a movie as much as I enjoy seeing a character grow and change throughout a movie whether a character reaches a goal and is a different person because of it or even witnessing a character's descent into madness. This movie's character development had me enthralled with the storytelling skills and development of the characters Jenny, Forrest, and Lieutenant Dan. Jenny's character in this story plays an important role in Forrest's life as a love interest that he is constantly chasing through the bounds of the common trope of unrequited love. In the beginning, Jenny found Forrest as a genuine love interest, but throughout the years she grew distant from him perhaps looking for something more than what she had. We watch Jenny go on these adventures throughout the film as if she were searching for something that she had been missing or dreaming about but she never really seems happy with herself. She has then reunited with Forrest again near the end of the film and it is at that point that she finds out that what she truly missed out on was a comfortable life with Forrest. Tom Hanks performed the role of Forrest Gump exceptionally well to the point of becoming synonymous with him. Forrest does have some character development, but not in the traditional personality changing way that we often see in films and shows. Forrest changes others through his interactions, but he remains the same innocent and kind-hearted man as he was in the beginning. Lieutenant Dan however is a very strong case of character development done right. Upon meeting Lieutenant Dan, he appears to be a goal-orientated man with confidence, but after having a traumatic event happen to him, he feels degraded and cheated from his destiny by Forrest. However, we can witness Lieutenant Dan recuperate from his tragic downfall and come back stronger, and happier than he was before through events orchestrated, albeit accidentally, by Forrest again.\nAgain, this movie is the basis of what I would consider being a perfect example of movies done right with the correct execution of character development. For this reason, Forrest Gump has solidified itself in the rankings of my favorite movies I've watched to date.",

It covers the time period from the \u201850s to the \u201880s, with the titular hero inadvertently immersing himself in Vietnam, Watergate, Chinese diplomacy, and a variety of other scenarios.  The film is helped along by a great performance from Tom Hanks, a colorful story, some fantastic dialogue, wonderfully creative visual effects and a memorable soundtrack.

            "content": "Combining elements of comedy, motivation to satire. Forrest Gump, a film directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring veteran actor Tom Hanks, manages to instill very deep moral values \u200b\u200bin every scene. The film, which was made in 1994, deserves to be called the best film of all time. The film, based on the novel by Winston Groom, tells the story of a man named Forrest Gump. Forrest who since childhood was considered a stupid child with an IQ of 75 has a unique life story. Having been belittled by everyone, Forrest continued to go forward with a stupid label by others against him. Forrest Gump is an epic film that makes the audience realize that behind the shortcomings there are many advantages in each person. The nature of the main character Forrest Gump can certainly be a good example for everyone. So what kind of traits can we imitate from Forrest Gump's character?\n\n1. Loving Parents\nWe can see how much Forrest Gump loves his mother. In the film he is willing to swim from the ocean and run through the city when he hears the news that his mother, Mrs. Gump is sick. Forrest Gump certainly realized that his mother's struggle could not be reciprocated with anything. The mother who always supports Forrest in the midst of his shortcomings makes Forrest realize that his mother is his hero\n2. Always positive and optimistic\nAlthough Forrest Gump is known as an idiot character in the film. But his stupidity is not a problem for a Forrest. He keeps going and always thinks positive. Don't complain and always try. In the film, Forrest Gump always shows his positive nature in any situation and in any crisis. Can you copy this?\n3. Never give up and be generous\nOf course, if you have watched the Forrest Gump movie, you will realize how generous the character Forrest Gump is. After he managed to create a shrimp company with the initials of his friend Bubba Gump Shrimp Corporation. He and Lieutenant Dan, a character frustrated by his disability during the Vietnam war, started a shrimp fishing business. After repeatedly failing to catch shrimp at the beginning of his search for shrimp. Forrest Gump didn't give up. He tried many times and of course failed many times. Until one day his shrimp catch was successful and together with Lieutenant Dan he managed to create the most successful shrimp fishing company in his city. Forrest Gump, who seemed to be a very successful businessman, didn't feel happy.Until finally he handed over his company to Lieutenant Dan and gave his income to the Bubba family, his best friend who had motivated him to start the shrimp fishing company\n4. Good promise holder\nBubba is a black man whom Forrest met when he joined the military. Forrest and Bubba's relationship is quite unique. It's said that their friends don't seem too close. But this is the other side of the Forrest Gump movie. Bubba, who when he was with Forrest, always talked about the world of shrimp, of course, for many people who listened to him talk about shrimp, it was quite boring. But not with Forrest, he always listened to Bubba talk about shrimp and Bubba's dream that when he finished his military duty he would set up a shrimp company with Forrest. But unlucky, Bubba died on the battlefield. Until it was left Forrest with his promise with Bubba to set up a shrimp fishing company. Instead of burying the promise. Forrest kept his promise to his best friend Bubba by successfully founding a very successful company, the Bubba Gump Shrimp Corporation. Forrest's promise and dream with Bubba finally came true\n5. Don't forget friends and best friends in any situation\nThe next Forrest Gump trait that you can emulate is that he always helps anyone. You can see it in the film even in critical times when Forrest and his troops are attacked by the enemy. Had separated well with his best friend Bubba and Lieutenant Dan. Forrest did not want to stay silent, he finally returned to the battlefield and saved his friends who were still alive even though they were full of wounds. No exception for Lieutenant Dan who he saved even though he had to lose his leg in the end. Lieutenant Dan, who was frustrated with his disability, was angry with Forrest. But again Forrest did not want to forget the Lieutenant Dan. He accidentally meets Lieutenant Dan who turns into a beggar in a wheelchair. Forrest, who at that time was a hero of his country, certainly felt sorry for Lieutenant Dan. Over time Forrest managed to raise new hope for Lieutenant Dan by getting him to join his shrimp fishing company. Lieutenant Dan joins in until Forrest gladly hands over the company he built to Lieutenant Dan. An extraordinary trait.\n6. Faithful in love affairs\nNot only comedy and motivational elements in the Forrest Gump film. Of course the romance drama between Forrest and Jenny can be a good example for everyone. The single love story between Forrest Gump and Jenny seems to break the audience's heart when they see how loyal Forrest Gump is to Jenny. Although he had been separated several times for a long time and many times Forrest Gump was rejected by Jenny and many times he saw Jenny's bad side. Forrest Gump remained standing faithfully waiting for Jenny. He still loves Jenny with all her flaws. Until finally he and Jenny got married. But the marriage did not last long because Jenny had to leave the world early due to a virus due to her wild life. Forrest Gump must have been very sad, Jenny's long-awaited love finally ended briefly. For Forrest Gump, Jenny was his first and last love.\n7. Good father\nAt the end of the story, Forrest Gump who has become a father, gives his best love to his son. He applies the love he gets from his mother who is also a single parent. Without Jenny's presence, Forrest Gump performed his role appropriately to be a good father to his son. This film deserves to be watched and imitated in our daily lives because there are so many valuable messages and moral values \u200b\u200bthat we can follow in this film. This film, which has been nominated for 13 Academy Awards, you must watch this at least once in your life!!!!",

As for the movie's uncomplimentary view of the counterculture, there was plenty of bad as well as good about the 1960's-divisiveness, racial and other hatred, violence, the spread of venereal diseases, etc. But not only the left gets skewered.

            "content": "Forrest Gump: A Simple Man in a Strange Land.\n\nThis week I watched the 1994 film Forrest Gump. Directed by Robert Zemeckis, the film stars Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise and Sally Field and tells the story of a mentally disabled man named Forrest Gump who lives through and witnesses many crucial events of the 60's and 70's and with his innocent, hardworking yet simple nature seemingly lucks into a very successful life. Around Forrest are many people going through the turmoil of the times and while their lives are affected negatively by the tumultuous culture they cannot help being positively influenced by Forrest's simple and sweet nature. What struck me most about The film is what a straightforward and honest approach to filmmaking it is. The story manages to be heartwarming and uplifting without sugarcoating any aspects of what happened in the 60's and 70's and portraying what life was like for many who were young adults at the time. Each and every aspect of filmmaking is masterfully done and every trick in the book is used in it's impressive technical side but it's groundbreaking achievements and magnificently utilized tactics do not point us toward awe inspiring spectacle but instead draw us even nearer as an audience to the harsh realities and human lives that it portrays. I think the movie works so well because it is not attempting to be blatantly nostalgic and not trying to be saccharine about its subject matter but it uplifts the spirit and moves the soul in its soaring heights and devastating lows. It is the drama of life presented in a very real way with one central thing elevating it and lightening all the terrible things we see and hear throughout the course of the film: Forrest Gump. By centering on such a fascinating character that is completely unaffected by the chaotic world around him, who holds stubbornly to his old fashioned values and walks through life with simple goals that are not swayed by the tide of cultural upheaval around him, the film creates a new and powerful way to look at the events of the 60's and 70's but also a unique and meaningful way to look at life itself. The film is set in the 60's 70's but it is not tied down by a single time period. Forrest is a man apart from his time and thus apart from any time. The themes and characters are timeless in the questions they ask and the struggles they face and so a film set so conspicuously in such a crucial time in history is able to speak to what came before and what will come after it in an eloquence that only its title character could provide. Yet another masterclass in good filmmaking in all respects (and recipient of six Academy Awards) all of its many achievements are as nothing to the heart and person at its center and each aspect points in its own way to the man at the heart and succeed in effecting us as an audience much like Forrest Himself affects those around him: innocently and unassumingly taking us along on a journey that will move, amuse and even inspire. Sweet and heartwarming without losing any emotional push for it, Forrest Gump is an achievement in portraying a unique perspective on the world that draws out all of its joys and sorrows in a very poignant way. The film truly is like a box of chocolates, you might not know what you're going to get and you may not always like it but the experience is an enjoyable mix of sweet and bitter and the aftertaste is truly satisfying.\n\n\nForrest Gump, through its clear direction and talented and dedicated performers and artists, excels at portraying not only the world of Forrest Gump but the world through his eyes. Of course the flow and unity of vision in the film must be attributed to the director Robert Zemeckis and the value of the story lies with the inspiring adaptation work from Eric Roth but if I were to choose two people who defined the spirit of the film for me and truly seemed to understand and convey its themes and messages it would be Tom Hanks himself and composer Alan Sylvestri. The truth of the matter is that without Tom Hanks there would be no Forrest Gump. The words of the character and his life are all printed out in the script but it took an extra special performance to truly hit home how special Forrest really is. It is not an understatement when the poster for the film says \"Tom Hanks is Forrest Gump'' because that is simply how it is. Even with his recognizable face and presence Tom Hanks becomes Forrest Gump, portraying all the simplicity and innocence, loyalty and love that Forrest has in the only way possible. That is why Tom Hanks is Forrest Gump because it could not have been anyone else. I've already said that every aspect of the film points to the man at its center and rests on his character but the character rests on Hanks and he carries the weight with wonderful skill. As Tom Hanks hides in plain sight in the film so does Alan Sylvestri's truly inspiring score. In all ways it is as simple and sweet as the main character but while it is sometimes happily so other times its simple strains can be truly heartbreaking. Each theme is so successful in creating the emotions necessary. The simple bouncing melody that represents Forrest's relationship with his mother, the tragic and somber strains of Jenny's theme and the triumphant brass whenever Forrest is running. Of all the things that give us the lens to see the film through Forrest's eyes it is the score that hides unnoticed most of the time but keeps its spirit of innocence amidst many songs of the time that appear on the soundtrack. The mixing of the pop music of the time with a simple mostly piano instrumental score is the spirit of the film captured completely on the musical spectrum. Surrounded by the culture just like Forrest yet maintaining its beautiful symplicity and emerging at the end as the element that tugged at our hearts even if we did not realize it. In all aspects the film pulls off the enormous feat of placing the audience in the heart of so many turbulent events of history yet keeps us safe in the peaceful protection of Forests honest and well meaning outlook. Forrest comes in contact with some of the worst parts of society and some of the hardest parts of living and yet he keeps going and is not swayed by all that goes on around him and thus we the audience can watch knowing that terrible things may happen but we can still rest in the quiet comfort that is simplicity. This was all said without even mentioning the cinematography, production design and ridiculously unnoticable visual effects and other strong supporting performances throughout the film. Forrest Gump is a masterclass in all aspects of filmmaking and it has a great amount of merit because of it but at the end of the day its biggest achievement is the story it tells with those elements. \n\nWith a film that covers the highs and lows of three decades of a man's life, one can expect many deep questions to be asked and timeless lessons to be learned. One of the central messages of the film is hinted at in its very first shot of a feather blowing in the wind until finally resting at Forrest's foot as he sits at a bus stop. It is then said explicitly as Forrest mourns at Jenny's grave. He says to her  \"Jenny I don't know if Momma was right or if. If it's Lieutenant Dan. I don't know if we each have a destiny, or if we're just floating around accidental like on the breeze, but I, I think maybe it's both. Maybe both is happening at the same time.\" The genius of the opening credits of the film is that it portrays this Idea literally while still lending to its message. The feather floats for a long time going in all directions, quite accidental like on the breeze but it finally and inevitably ends up coming across the main character. That was its destiny. And at the end of the credits one almost can think that by brushing the foot of our protagonist the feather is passing the nature of its existence on to Forrest as he recounts the story of his life, a life that he seemed to luck through. Unaware as a feather and just as poised to be blown wherever the winds of his fortune blow. Yet his life is not one happy accident after another. He still has a destiny. That which he sees and pursues. In his simple straightforward way, Forrest is pursuing his destiny much as a feather on the wind. The film's presentation of contrast between the old world of Forrest's and the new world of the sexual revolution gives ample opportunity to ponder a simple question: Does Forrest belong in the world he lives in? In other words, is this no country for Forrest? Yes the question is posed in another more explicit way in No Country For Old Men but hidden beneath the Drama of Forrest's life and the humor and heartbreak of his incongruence with the rest of the world is the question of belonging and Forrest's is an acute case of this predicament. Such is the depth of the question that it can only be pondered and it is too distant for a concrete answer on paper so I can't even begin to try and answer it. Suffice it to say that there are so many spiritual, cultural and human themes in Forrest Gump, so many joys and sorrows of the human experience that its depth can be pondered long after the Film comes to an end and before that, with so much substance as backdrop, creates an almost overwhelming cinematic experience.\n\n\nAt the center of every great drama there is the human person, full of flaws and doubts, misgivings and mistakes but all the while continuing to live their lives for better or worse. The central character of this drama is Forrest himself, so apart from the cares and troubles of the world and yet still doing his part to ease some suffering as he goes through his incredible journey of a life. Blissfully unaware of how truly terrible life can be, Forrest nevertheless experiences so much of the sorrows of life and comes close to so many terrible events that devastated the 60's and 70's. Forrest's relationship with those around him and to the events that surround his life is best summed up in his own words \"I may not be a smart man but I know what love is\" He feels compassion for such men as John F. Kennedy and John Lennon even though he can't fathom as to why they would be killed. He fights bravely in Vietnam and saves many of his fellow soldiers' lives even when he can't even begin to grasp that there is a terrible war going on around him. He cares for his girl Jenny, always looking out for her good even if he doesn't understand what tragedies have filled her life. Forrest Might be mentally unaware of all the events surrounding him but he is very aware of the people in his life and he reaches out to them in the only way he knows, with love and compassion. The two that are most affected by this are Jenny, the love of Forrest's life and Lieutenant Dan, his commanding officer in Vietnam. Both are victims of the time they live in, caught up and swept aside by the culture and the current events. Jenny grows up with an abusive father and when she gets nowhere with a folk singer career she embraces the hippie lifestyle and lives a life of destitution and despair. Lieutenant Dan was saved by Forrest in Vietnam but protested furiously, wanting to die with his men. When he loses both legs to injuries sustained in the battle he too starts a destitute life in Washington D.C. Throughout her life Jenny has come to Forrest for comfort but it is clear that because of her upbringing she does not know how to love a man like Forrest in the right way. She finally realises this and when Forrest asks her to marry him she declines and leaves the next day. Finally after three years she sends a letter to Forrest inviting him to visit her. It appears that after so much time she has finally learned why her life was so drastically different from Forrest's and is living a quiet life as a waitress and caring for her son Forrest Jr. The two finally marry and live their days happily until Jenny dies from sickness. Though Jenny lives a wild life apart from Forrest, his calm and simple presence through it all finally brings her around to recognizing the good in life. Lieutenant Dan is perplexed by Forrest's honest to goodness attitude during the war and afterwards becomes angry at Forrest for it as the two live together for a time. Lieutenant Dan states to Forrest that it was his destiny to die in Vietnam and that Forrest took it away from him. When Forrest goes to start a shrimping business Lieutenant Dan joins him, keeping a promise he made on whim that if Forrest ever bought a boat then he would be his first mate. Through Forrest's influence, Lieutenant finally realises that his life is worth living and at long last finally thanks Forrest for saving him in Vietnam. In taking a choice that may have seemed against a real \"destiny\" Lieutenant Dan and Forrest make their fortunes in a characteristically unexpected way and run a successful shrimping business. Through his childlike simplicity and love, Forrest's life was able to give hope and purpose to two who had none. The characters of Forrest Gump could be relatable but only to a select few. The truth of the matter is that they live human lives, lives that anyone can connect with and be moved by.\n\nForrest Gump is incredible. A mix of bitter and sweet, joy and sorrow, laughter and tears, tragic historical events and flights of whimsy all with its title character in the center, telling us the story of his wonderful life. Though its narrative is powerful it is nearly outshined by the prowess with which it is told. Direction, performances, music and visual effects all bringing a deeply personal story to glorious life. With a strong backbone of cultural, personal and spiritual themes, the narrative hits very deep and can resonate with all people. Of the characters only one thing can be said. The highest compliment I can give: They are human. After watching the film I thought \"this is now one of my favorite films\" and in the course of writing this essay I realized just how much can be said about it. What can I say except it is a true piece of art that tells a genuinely moving story.",

            "content": "Forrest Gump is a 1994 film directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring Tom hanks and Robin Wright.\n\nForrest Gump (Tom Hanks), a slow but simple man from Alabama takes us through decades of his life, which includes various historical settings but all the while his heart is on Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), a childhood friend.\n\nFORREST GUMP was released and quickly became a huge hit and ended up winning many Oscars. Today, for whatever reason, the film seems to be hated by many people because of the movies it beat out. I've never really understood putting too much importance on Oscars or any other award show and I really don't understand why one movie must take a beating just because of what films it beat out. ORDINARY PEOPLE takes a beating because it beat RAGING BULL. Something like DANCES WITH WOLVES takes a beating because it beat GOODFELLAS. Then there's FORREST GUMP that takes a beating because it beat out PULP FICTION or THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.\n\nAs far as the film itself goes I think this is a great one. I've always liked how the film took a look at a simple person's life and a simple person who is always in very big situations yet never really understands it. There are countless bits of dialogue that are remembered by mans and they've entered the public IQ but the one dealing with knowing what love is is the one that always caught my attention as far as what this film is about. To me Gump goes through all these historic things yet it's always his love for Jenny that is the heart of the picture.\n\nI thought the story itself was quite great and especially how we take a look at American history through the 60s, 70s and 80s. I know some people make this a political movie but I've always found that to be rather foolish. The film has a wonderful soundtrack to highlight the various eras that are shown and we also get some clever use of CGI to put Gump in the presence of people like JFK and Richard Nixon. The screenplay hits all the right notes and there's no question that technically speaking the film is impressive.\n\nThen there are the performances that really make the movie. Hanks picked up his second Best Actor award and while I personally would have given it to Paul Newman for his performance in NOBODY'S FOOL, there's no question that Hanks is great here. He certainly nailed that \"simple\" man and there's not a false moment in the performance. Gary Sinise is wonderful in his role as is Mykelti Williamson in his small bit. Robin Wright Penn is the perfect opposite to Hank's character and Sally Field is good as well.\n\nNo matter what people say, FORREST GUMP is still a wonderful little gem that has a lot of great things in it.",

The best thing about this movie is Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump. He's so captivating and so likeable that you're invested in every part of his journey whether it's the bullying he receives, his services in the army, his romance with Jenny or his shrimping with Lieutenant Dan, another underrated part of the movie with such amazing character development. I was invested in Forrest's story the whole movie and that ending is sad. I think the movie is a bit too long.

His character's only point is to present a fresh lens on America circa 1955-1982.  He experiences way more of key points in history and culture than anyone possibly could, and then calls them out for what they are.  American Boomer culture is actually the main character here.  Does it work?  Maybe - as much as any unconventional narrative can.  And maybe more so if you are a Boomer.",

It was certainly long, probably even too long as some of the scenes of him being a part of history seemed unnecessary and poorly done like the Black Panther thing, but this was such a cultural phenomenon that I was certainly lacking as a well-rounded person for having avoided it for so long. I was surprised by a lot of things, most notably Tom's very narrow head. I watched this after seeing the Back to the Future series & recognized some Zemeckis characteristics in the way the narrative was framed, what with the bootstrapping protagonist. I don't think Sinise deserved an Oscar nomination for his role, though Hanks absolutely did; the decision to pile all of the negative characterization in the movie onto the girl who simply didn't love the protagonist back seemed heavy-handed and rather bizarre, as they portray her as his only real problem his entire life by showing him going through everything else without any true difficulty as they used the narration to provide his rationale for decisions to do things like rescuing his friends in the war. The narrating was obviously very good with the southern accent and the jokes, but it really was excessive as they couldn't make it through a single scene without it. Plenty of other movies use the framing of the character re-telling the story to someone else, but having so few scenes without it made the movie almost into an audiobook where you could close your eyes and never lose track of the plot. I also expected a bit more from the Oscar-nominated special effects as the historical footage had lip flap problems that relatively amateur anime dubs of the same era were conquering. Still strong viewing material, and clearly an excellent production.",

She sleeps with Forrest and then years later invites him over to tell him that he is the father, all the while knowing she is going to give up the ghost. She only marries him when she knows she hardly has any time left... It's kind of hard to watch really.

            "content": "Forrest Gump is one of those feel-good Hollywood movies that grows on people within age. Based on a novel, the film follows the life of Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), a mentally-handicapped savant from Greenbow, Alabama who rides through waves of the second half of the 20th Century: meeting Elvis Presley, joining the University of Alabama's football team, meeting Presidents Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon, enlisting in Vietnam, joining the ping-pong tournament, fishing for shrimp, and even jogging across the United States. During which he starts an on-again off-again relationship with Jenny (Robin Wright) and they have a child, get married and she dies of AIDS. While not without its sappy and corny moments, the film has plenty of heart in all the right places. The best parts are Hanks's performance and his epic 30-year journey edited with him in present-day sitting on a bench talking to random passengers. It's so mesmerizing hearing his Southern accent as he tells his story and it makes you want to listen to him even more. The worst parts involve Jenny, who I believe takes advantage of Forrest and leaves him in the dust to pose for Playboy, snort cocaine, and join the Black Panther party. She doesn't even notice the fact that he traveled from one country to another just to see her again. On top of that, Jenny is probably the least interesting character in the movie as she holds accountable for its sugary syrupy moments and cliched lines. Despite my complaints, Forrest Gump is still a great all-American breakfast with just the right amount of eggs, bacon and short stacks. \n\n(4 Shrimp with Ping Pong Paddles out of 5)",

We see Forrest from a young boy, a college footballer, in the army, a shrimp captain before becoming a figure for many. It's a very sweet movie interspersed with how Jenny gets drawn into many difficult life choice. Forrest longs for her but Jenny only at the end of her life understands. Watching Hanks as he talks to Jenny at her grave is very emotional as is his sadness over many in Vietnam including Bubba. The film has many funny moments as well as using songs of the era really well. Robert Zemekis has directed the film using great visual effects and CGI enabling  Forrest to appear with many key figures including presidents and John Lennon. The scenes in Vietnam with the gun fire and explosions give a sense that you are there.  The running scenes with the many spectacular scenes of America is a great love letter to its beauty. Visually stunning. Forrest never totally knows what his destiny is but ultimately many people benefit from him being in their life.

There are no faults in the way he played Forrest. The film also has an amazing plot and message. For Forrest to not only have survived polio, but also to be most likely (even though not mentioned in the film) on the autism spectrum or to have autism, shows how anyone can do anything. The heartfelt story also had amazing little tie-ins to the time period, like how Forrest inspired Elvis's dancing, or how Forrest called in The Watergate Scandal. I actually laughed at the later moment, finding it very amusing. Also including moments and groups, such as the Vietnam War, The Black Panther Party, The War Hawks and Peace Dove, and the multiple assassinations/assassination attempts were so important to add as they helped define the period, were seamlessly added into the plot. Also the moments of Forrest, not realizing the severity of the situation he is in, but just wanting help someone, are very heart warming and show how we must all treat each other with respect. For example: When he picks up the African-American student's notebook and hands it to here, not caring about what could happen, or knowing about the situation that was really going on. Or when he goes back and saves the men, even when he is looking for Bubba and could die in the line of fire, especially Lieutenant Dan. \nThere are only two moments I find fault with (even those are minor and have reasoning behind them). One: When Jenny leaves Forrest the last time, it was confusing onto why she left him again?. But it is in her character to run away and not confront her problems, until she does at the very end asking Forrest Gump to marry her, giving her an arc. and Two: How his boat, Jenny, made it full circle without a driver and crashed into the dock? It makes no sense, even if you factor in current and wind. But the moment is funny, especially how Hanks causally delivers the lines that follow, so it is fine.\nAnyone who is breathing has to see this before they die, or they will regret.",

            "content": "Forrest Gump (1994) is a movie that follows a man, Forrest Gump, with a low IQ who keeps accidentally finding himself in many important and historical moments. This movie is full of intertextuality with real life, such as the Vietnam War, The Black Panther Party, and the Ping Pong diplomacy. I believe that the intertextualities in this movie help the director present the movie's political stance. A movie's political stance is the thoughts that the movie tries to instill in people's minds to either teach them something or make them act a certain way. In order for a movie to have a political stance, it needs to have an ideological position \u2013 a system of beliefs. The politics and ideology of Forrest Gump are ones that advocate for simplicity and patience. Through the form and content \u2013 where the form is the way the movie is shot and content is the dialogue \u2013 one can notice that the movie is saying that leading a simple life, being an honest person, and not complicating things like Forrest, can lead you to accomplishing great things. \n\tThe movie's political stance is not one that can be noticed easily since it relies on macro narratives, where the audience need to look at the bigger picture and link all the events of the movie together to understand what idea the movie trying to spread. It feels like the movie itself was conscious of its themes of simplicity, but Forrest was not.  Forrest was often unaware of the importance of the events happening around him such as the Hippie movement or being dragged into the Black Panther Party, however, everyone else around him was. Jenny, Forrest's love interest and his first ever friend, was aware that the successes he reached to, such as being awarded the Medal of Honor and being really rich due to his shrimp business, was due to the fact that he was an honest man who always did the right thing. Forrest's patience for Jenny to love him back ended up in them starting a family.\n\tJust like any other movie, Forrest Gump relies on elements such as irony, foreshadowing, and architecture to present its plot and political stance. I found it ironic how when Forrest started telling his story to people, he explained the origins of his name to a black woman. This is ironic because he was named after his ancestor, the founder of the The Klu Klux Klan, a hate group that targeted African Americans and supported slavery. The irony of this scene, however, sets the floor for the political stance to start forming, since Forrest thinks in the simplest way to the point where he did not realize that it is probably not a good idea to tell an African American woman that he was related to the founder of the KKK. \n\tForrest Gump relies heavily on foreshadowing. It was foreshadowed that Forrest and Jenny would eventually end up together from the beginning of the movie when Jenny and Forrest were sitting together on a tree branch and then Jenny holds his hand and tells him to stay with her a little longer. When Jenny and Forrest went to different universities, Forrest would visit her in her university. One time, Forrest saw her in a car with another man and they were engaged in a sexual interaction however it seemed to hurt Jenny. Forrest stepped in and pulled the man away from her even though he could have ended up in a fight with the man. This scene foreshadowed two important things, first, Jenny would end up in a lot of abusive relationships, and second, Forrest will always be loyal and protective of her no matter how much it would hurt him. Moreover, the movie also relies on referencing itself in order to foreshadow upcoming events. This can be seen in the scene when Forrest rides the bus on his way to the army and no one would let him sit next to them except for Bubba. The movie is refencing itself because a similar scene happened in the beginning of the movie when Forrest rode the bus on his way to school and only Jenny would let him sit next to her. This self-referencing foreshadowed that Forrest and Bubba were to be best friends and that Forrest would remain loyal to him.\n\tMoreover, the movie uses its architecture to foreshadow and build up its political stance. The architecture of a movie consists of the buildings and the lighting of the movie \u2013 in other words, it is the design of the movie's environment. Forrest and his mother live in a big house in the rural Alabama. Rural areas are characterized by simplicity and honesty. Forrest living in a simple environment foreshadows that Forrest himself will grow up to be a simple man. Since children are the product of their environment, and the accomplishments of one are a product of who they are, then the environment you grew up in causes your accomplishments. Forrest living in a rural area helps the movie's political stance because all of Forrest's accomplishments are due to simplicity.\n\tForrest Gump is a brilliant movie that uses many aspects of films and links them together in a unique way to present its political stance. The political stance of Forrest Gump is leading a simple life and having patience can lead you to accomplishing great things. The movie presents its politics through the use of irony, foreshadowing and architecture. I really enjoyed this movie and I would recommend others to watch it.",

The simplicity of this film is the main reason to love it. This is a movie of a heart-breaker of oddball wit and startling grace. There's talk of another Oscar for Tom Hanks.In a college dorm with Jenny, who lets him touch her breast, the virginal Forrest ejaculates instantly, losing her interest and his self-respect. In the Army, Forrest saves his captain (Gary Sinise), whose legs are later amputated, and the captain resents him. Forrest is everything we admire in the American character - honest, brave, loyal - and the film's fierce irony is that nobody can stay around him for long. Zemeckis doesn't fall into the trap of using Forrest as an ad for arrested development. He knows the limits of a holy fool who can't understand the hypocrisy of postwar America that this picaresque epic so powerfully reveals. The peace-love pretensions of the '60s are skewered as neatly as the greed decades that follow. But there is something of Forrest that Zemeckis would like to see rub off on us: his capacity for hope. It's an ambitious goal in this age of rampant cynicism. Godspeed.",

There's Forrest Gump who's played by Tom Hanks with an IQ right below average. But his mom let's Forrest know that there's nothing that can hold him back. He's is made fun of in school and no one will let him sit next to them on the bus. He has to wear leg braces, has a crooked back, and does not have too many friends. One girl, Jenny tells him he can sit with heron the bus. Jenny ends up being Forrest's best friend and crush. Unfortunately, for Jenny we find out her and her sisters are being sexually abused by their father. Jenny ends up with a lifetime of drug and alcohol abuse that unfortunately costs her life. One day, Forrest and Jenny are walking to school and there are some mean kids calling Forrest stupid and throwing rocks at him. Jenny yells to Forrest \"Run Forrest, Run!\"and  he breaks the braces off of his legs and runs incredibly fast. Throughout the movie Forrest meets many celebrities, including: Elvis Presley, President Kennedy, President Johnson, President Nixon, and John Lennon. Although, the best people he meets along the way are Bubba and Lieutenant Dan , his Vietnam war friends, Bubba wants to own a great shrimp boat one day.  Bubba is similar to Forrest, he also has a learning disability.  Unfortunately in the Vietnam War, Bubba dies, and Lieutenant Dan loses his leg in a huge attack. Forrest was saving soldiers including Lieutenant Dan from running in and out of the battlefield. For his bravery, Forrest ends up receiving a  medal of honor. Down the line, Forrest ends up saving Lieutenant Dan again. He finds him in New York, a depressed alcoholic. From there Forrest and Lieutenant Dan go on to pursue Bubba's dream and establish the Bubba Gump shrimp boat in honor of Bubba. The shrimp boat ends up being a huge success for Forrest and Lieutenant Dan. It ends up making them a whole lot of money. Lieutenant Dan's depression goes away and he gets himself a fresh new pair of prosthetic legs. Towards the end of the movie, Jenny comes back into Forrest's life. She realizes she is not well and is dying and comes to tell Forrest that they had a kid together. Forrest takes care of Jenny up until her last day. From then on out, it's just Forrest and his son Forrest Jr. At the very end of the movie, Forrest forgets about everything and just runs, very very far. Until he gets aged features on his face and a huge beard.  In my opinion, the movie Forrest Gump is a must watch and has a very empowering theme to it. From the famous lines in the movie to the humorous and emotionally powerful scenes, it's an overall iconic and legendary film. The reason I liked this movie the most is the meaning of the movie, at least what I got out of watching it, is to never give up!",

            "content": "On July 6, 1994, Paramount unveiled Robert Zemeckis' Forrest Gump in theaters. The Tom Hanks satire would go on to win six Oscars at the 67th Academy Awards, including best picture. The Hollywood Reporter's original review is below:\n\nForrest Gump is not stupid. Although his IQ is 75, he sees the world far clearer than most. Through his decent, childlike eyes, we too see things in a less confused and muddled way. In this cheerfully straight-arrow moral tale, Tom Hanks stars as the \"wise fool\" Forrest Gump and delivers yet another Oscar-level performance. Paramount will win sensational box office with this Robert Zemeckis-directed film. \n\nRaised in the '50s in rural Alabama by a single mother (Sally Field), Forrest, being \"different,\" must fend for himself, struggling against not only perceived expectations but boyhood bullies. He unwittingly finds that he's blessed with a talent \u2014 he can run like the wind, which wins him a football scholarship to play for Bear Bryant at the University of Alabama. And there's no stopping him after that.\n\nAn uplifting saga about one young boy's earnest and good-natured attempts to overcome his disabilities, Forrest Gump is also a cheeky social satire of the past 40 years of U.S. social-political history. Eric Roth's screenplay, adapted from Winston Groom's novel, nimbly intertwines Forrest's life with the seminal social events and players of the past several decades. Unassuming Forrest, with his golly-gee enthusiasm and inbred decency, encounters the likes of Elvis, George Wallace, presidents Kennedy through Nixon, Dick Cavett, John Lennon and Abbie Hoffman as he graduates from 'Bama, fights in Vietnam, competes in international ping-pong, founds a shrimping company, engages in philanthropy and jogs cross-country. \n\nContrasting Forrest's unassuming innocence with the upheavals and rancor of the times, the film is a wisely goofy commentary on the stupidity of smartness. \n\nWhile Forrest's foray's into the dens of the big and powerful are cheekily amusing, the film ambles along over a deeper, darker layer: Forrest's love for his childhood girlfriend, Jenny (Robin Wright). An abused child, Jenny's life path is a desperate wander to find solid ground. She falls prey to every social movement and fad of the times; unlike Forrest, whose unwavering strength and sense of right and wrong protect him from being caught up in social slides, Jenny's genuflections reflect her lack of firm values and inner confidence. \n\nTo some extent, one could argue that Jenny symbolizes most of us. If any criticism might be leveled at the film, it is that its most heart-wrenching moments are too adeptly skirted, but, then again, that's in keeping with Forrest's strength. Highest praise to Zemeckis, who has reached a higher maturity plane with his gracefully, technically eloquent direction. \n\nCarrying his torso in an erect, straight-arched manner, Hanks' body language is all-telling. With each strange or perplexing situation, Hanks erupts with the smallest twitch or turn, signaling Forrest's deep-seated disapproval or, in special other cases, his gleeful, thankful wonderment. Mykelti Williamson, as Forrest's simple-minded G.I. buddy, is also outstanding, while Gary Sinise is sympathetic as Forrest's bitter platoon leader, legless after the Vietnam War.",

When cruel Jenny asked him how was Vietnam, he didn't talk about violence and blood, but about the sky at night.\n\nInstead of thinking about the meaning of life, Forrest says us to do something about it.

            "content": "Heartwarming and sentimental.\n\nRobert Zemeckis' Forrest Gump (1994) is a sweet romance drama with a distinctive comedic style. Tom Hanks' narration is fun and strictly from his mentally challenged character Forrest Gump's childlike perspective. This keeps Forrest Gump innocent as a film, but thoughtful for the audience who know the historical events are real and have meaning.\n\nMy major gripe with Forrest Gump is its ridiculous bloated run-time. It could easily have lost a whole half hour to ease the audience into this story. It's takes awhile before much of anything interesting happens and focuses too much on silly moments in Gump's life.\n\nI do think there is a fair criticism to be made about Hanks' performance as just using a simple minded man as a means to awards praise. This movie does little to make you understand Gump's perspective until he says he may be stupid, but he understands love to Jenny.\n\nI like Tom Hanks' warm and likable performance, but Forrest Gump is stolen by the charismatic and tragic portrayal of a Vietnam veteran Lieutenant Dan by Gary Sinise. He captures the humor and depression of his situation that makes the movie feel so real, even though it's all a fantasy.\n\nYou can say that Robin Wright is great as Jenny, but her character is detestable, as she uses Gump when she needs him, but does not offer any kindness in return. Jenny is a complex figure in cinematic history. She is important to Gump as she is his friend, but you wonder why she never feels as real as Hanks' quaint man. Sally Field is at least supportive and kindly as his odd mother.\n\nBoth Forrest and Jenny feel more like representations of their era instead of complete characters. Forrest is the all American athlete and Vietnam veteran that turns into a businessman and family figure. While Jenny is the abused girl that turns into a victimized woman, who engages in drug addiction and the hippy lifestyle until her world is turned upside down and she has no options left but Forrest. I question the moral of Forrest Gump as it never feels clear if they are saying there is a God or not like Jenny says, or if everything is up to destiny as Dan says. I think that Forrest's whole life is all random chance encounters and dumb luck, so was there really a message at all?\n\nAnyways, Zemeckis' direction is stellar and focused. Forrest Gump is easily one of his greatest films. Alan Silvestri's score is dreamy and romantic with a healthy amount of sentimental nostalgia for the past. The soundtrack to Forrest Gump is killer and very representative of its generations throughout the film.\n\nOverall, Forrest Gump is an undeniable classic movie in Americana. I think it has some flaws, but it is always entertaining.",

            "content": "I couldn't tell you how many times I have seen this film and yet I have never been disappointed or bored by it. It's lovely and impressive all at once the way it weaves together a decade spanning story featuring nearly every major historical figure and event of those eras and a sweet personal story of a man's love for a troubled woman. Tom Hanks' performance in the lead role is genius and great actors like Sally Field and Gary Sinise make their mark in small but memorable roles. The term feel-good is used to describe a lot of movies that possibly don't deserve it but this is a fantastical but genuinely heartwarming tale that mixes dark humor and slapstick to create an unforgettable film.\n\nForrest Gump, Tom Hanks, is a man who mentally isn't entirely there but his love of life and willingness to try anything allow him to be successful and as he encounters the Vietnam War, the Olympics and the run across the United States he succeeds. The one goal that he struggles to achieve however is obtaining the affection of the love of his life, Jenny, Robin Wright, who has been sexually abused by her Father and faces drug addiction, suicidal thoughts and prostitution as she grows older. Throughout the film we see their diverging paths and when they are finally reunited it is bittersweet but the final scene of Gump dropping his son of at the bus stop is a tear-jerking moment.\n\nThe lead character is an oddity because he doesn't really face any obstacles in achieving great professional success, we are aware that some of those around him snigger at him cruelly but he is unaware of this and is able to become a war hero and shrimp millionaire with very little effort. Even the difficulties he faces in getting Jenny to love him are largely her battling her own demons while he waits for her to come around but this all magically works and he is one of the most compelling heroes ever written. The iconic lines in the film \"Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get\" and \"Run, Forrest, run\" are entertaining. But the screenplay also allows for some very dark moments such as when it is implied that Jenny and her sisters have been sexually abused and that Forrest's Mother will have to provide sexual favors to the school administrator for him to continue attending the school. \n\nJenny is interesting in that we understand her tragic backstory and we see her trying to strive to achieve something greater, she joins several protest movements, and because of that her failures hurt. When we realize that she is a prostitute attempting to play music instead of stripping it is devastating and her resistances to the interventions of Forrest are frustrating from an audience perspective but also understandable as she wants to be able to save herself instead of relying on a man. We see her intermittently, when compared to Forrest, but her influence over him is always felt as his desire to be with her triumphs over all other goals in his life and the tenderness he feels for her is felt by the audience as we see their son, a product of their love, with the same joy that they do.\n\nThe direction of this film was surely difficult as a lot needs to be stuffed into the film without it feeling overwhelming and the story needs to be whimsy and sentimental but at times dark without feeling tonally all over the place. Zemeckis directs the film so that is always compelling, funny, touching, sweet and most importantly, human, the tone of the film never feels like it wavers too dramatically even though it does often shift and Zemeckis' ability to capture all of those emotions is perfectly suited to a very emotional film. Hanks also walks a tightrope as a character who could very easily be offensive to those who are  mentally disabled, to some his portrayal is, but I think he pulls of Forrest's rose-colored lens attitude extremely well and handles both the comedic and dramatic elements that the performance requires with care. These two talented professionals bring to life this difficult to execute story.\n\nConsidering this film within the context of 1994 I still genuinely believe that this was the best mainstream film to come out of that year, yes there is a lot of love for The Shawshank Redemption (1994) and Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994) but this has to walk a harder balancing act and it pulls it off extremely well. In terms of more independent films to come out that year I would say Three Colors: White was a great black comedy but it was unlikely that something so out there was going to get a Best Picture nomination without a bully like Harvey Weinstein pushing it. This is a brilliant film that everyone should see and it's one of those Best Picture wins that has aged well.",

I must admit to not been particularly endeared to the actor although I have seen several good films in his filmography.\n2) The running time of well over 140 minutes has always put me off.\n3) Clips showing Hanks as the title character, Forrest Gump muttering phrases such as 'Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know quite what your gonna get..'\n\nAnyway actually watching it took me through the interesting life of a fictional character Gump, a man with low I.Q. but who has lived closely through several notable points in U.S. history up to 1994.\n1. Elvis Presley's dancing routine which a childhood Gump inadvertently introduces to the King whilst limping in leg braces.\n2. Serving in the bloody battlefields of the Vietnam War. Single handedly rescuing half his platoon and introducing fascinating characters including his wounded Platoon Lieutenant Dan Taylor (Gary Sinise).\n3. Meeting several U.S. Presidents including JFK as a member of his college football team, and Richard Nixon when being awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.\nIn the process witnessing the Watergate break in whilst staying at the Watergate Hotel at the recommendation of Nixon!\n4. His 'love' interest throughout the film Jenny Curran contracting an incurable virus in the early 1980s after a lifestyle of drug addiction? AIDS?\n5. A segment including a TV interview with the late John Lennon.\nIt was funny seeing Gump interwoven into old footage of famous people from the past 40 years or so.\nDirector Robert Zemekis, the man who brought Back To The Future to cinema audiences was behind this film and crowd pleasing elements of that film can be seen in Forrest Gump.\nTom Hanks delivers a great performance showing and narrating Forrest Gump's life on a bus stop bench to fascinated passers by.\nThe running time actually goes quite fast.\nThe supporting cast including Sinise deliver excellent performances and add to Gump's fascinating lifestory.",

A movie that makes you feel whatever it\u00e2(TM)s supposed to make you feel. And finally, a movie that you feel a connection with. It took me awhile to realize it, but the more I thought about it, Forrest Gump actually fit all those qualifications and more. I also love to do impressions and Forrest Gump is one of my favorite impressions to do. Its got an incredible soundtrack, its endlessly quotable, the special effects are unbelievable, you learn a lot about American history (which makes it a perfect classroom movie), every actor gives a great performance, it makes you laugh, it makes you cry, and it even makes you think. There\u00e2(TM)s also a religious aspect that I personally appreciate. Honestly, how can anyone not love this movie? Well it has received some backlash, but I still don\u00e2(TM)t get why. Most people probably don\u00e2(TM)t even know that it\u00e2(TM)s based on a book. A book that\u00e2(TM)s drastically different and doesn\u00e2(TM)t compare to the movie at all. People point out that it has a bad moral, that the romance is one sided, that it\u00e2(TM)s too feel good. First off, Forrest is not meant to be a character who goes through a lot of character development. He does what people say, but he helps people by doing it. He\u00e2(TM)s caring, protective, and always does the right thing despite his limited intelligence. Second off, the romance is not too one sided. Jenny comes from a difficult upbringing and its very likely she\u00e2(TM)d make bad decisions. Forrest was always there for her even when she wanted to push him away. And in the end, they were better together then apart. Third off, \u00e2too feel good.\u00e2? What does that even mean? I don\u00e2(TM)t know about you, but I\u00e2(TM)ll take feel good over relentlessly depressing anyday. Forrest Gump even managed to win Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor Tom Hanks, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Visual Effects, and Best Editing at the Academy Awards among some pretty stiff competition. While some people might not understand it, Forrest Gump is my favorite movie. It never fails to make me laugh, give me hope, and the ending makes me cry every time I see it (every time).

Brilliantly portrayed by Tom Hanks, Forrest Gump simply makes you feel good as a movie goer. It can make you believe in America even when you can view it as an ugly place. It can make you believe in love with a concept of Destiny even if you are jaded. This film has a sense of magic and innocence that few films will every be able to claim and it is for that reason that it is one of the best romantic comedies of all time. The film focuses on Gump who only cares for one woman Ginny (Robin Wright). Ginny is plagued by selfishness and cares of the world and Gump walks forward in the world dreaming to have her in his life. While he finds success being selfless she finds failure in selfishness. The result is a masterpiece that travels through America's past and any lover of history can immediately appreciate that. Gump is simply good film medicine for a troubled soul. If your feeling sick take this prescription and watch it again as needed.",

            "content": "This is one of the movies that made me love movies in general. Probably the movie I rewatched the most, and still rewatch it to this day. Forrest Gump is basically the dream American, but with a twist, which is him being slow. He has seen it all, done it all. So this can count as my love letter to Forrest Gump. I will break it down, act by act, **with spoilers**, of course. It starts with the first act, obviously. The first act introduces us to Forrest and his nature, as he tells people on the bus stop about his life. The whole story is told this way. It starts by telling us about his mother, which is his absolute role model. In this part of the movie we learn that Forrest's mom would go as far as possible to do anything for him and that he is not the sharpest tool in the shed to say the least. We also get introduced to his soon-to-be love of his life. And we get introduced to her as being the only one that accepts him out of the kids in his class. This part is mostly fun and it starts shfiting into the second act when he is well into his teens. The second act starts when Jenny leaves for the first time, and Forrest will go in the army. There he meets in similar fashion to Jenny, Bubba. He rambles on about how he wants to make a fish shrimp. Soon Forrest loses Bubba in the Vietnam, and saves his lieutenant, Dan Taylor. Dan is not happy that forrest saved him in the least. He believed that he was  meant to die on the battlefield like all his ancestors. But that obviously wasn't the case now. He then goes through a phase where he learns how to paly ping-pong and becomes an insanely good player. This second act is still fun, but it starts getting sadder and more self-aware. Not to mention he inspires John Lennon's Imagine and several other American and worldwide trends or culture, as he does throughout the ntire movie. This act lasts up until Forrest tells the man on the bus stop that he is the owner of Bubba Gump Shrimp Company. After this I'd say the movie takes a turn for the more emotional. His mother passes away and that deeply affects Forrest. Jenny comes back to him one day, after all this time he's been thinking about her, only to leave few days later. This is where he began running for three years straight, becoming a worldwide phenomenon. He runs all across the country and one day, he just decides to stop. This has a meaning behind it, which is that he felt like he had enough. He had enough of being alone, of running in life alone. And after that Jenny invites him to her home, where he sees Jenny had a child with him. Here's where Tom Hanks shines the most in the entire movie. The truly heartbraking look on his face is absolutely amazing. Well-deserved academy award for best actor in my opinion. They shortly after get married, and everyone is there, especially Lt. Dan, who has basically taken over his Shrimp Company by now. Not long after getting married, Jenny passes away due to AIDS. This also happened during the first AIDS outbreak in 1982. The movie ends with Forrest taking his son to the bus shool and waiting there for him until he eventually comes back, right after another insane moment from Hanks, when he talks to Jenny at her grave. Forrest Gump is a complex movie. This movie ranges from a comedy to a drama to a war flick. It goes through all those aspects and absolutely owns them. Forrest Gump feels like its own thing. A story that was significantly changed from the soure material. This is one of my favorite movies and I am for sure 100% biased when I say this, but, Forrest Gump is one of the best movies I've ever seen. If you somehow haven't seen it, do it. The beautiful score, cinematography, acting and amazing storytelling will hook you right up.",

Tom Hanks, the actor who played Forrest the main character, won just as many awards as the whole movie like the academy award for best actor and a lot more. The reason I believe that Tom Hanks got all of the awards he did is because he is an outstanding actor and one who I believe could play any role he is given and could do it outstandingly due to his always amazing performance and natural talent.

Critics pan it's sentimentality though I believe it is part of its charm and that the movie actually may be one of the greatest tales of the 20th century. Despite this, it is truly the character Forest Gump, whom is one of the greatest literary heroes of all time, and the actor who play's him, legendary actor Tom Hanks, shine in this film, along with Forest's mother who is an incredibly strong and kind woman whose only wish is that Forest is not outcast from society and is given the same opportunities as everyone else. Therefore, Forest Gump is a truly great film which outlines the rich history and culture of America during the 20th century while also telling a compelling story of an unlikely hero and his love Jenny.",

Alan Silvestri's beautiful score has always resonated with me, and represents life itself. What makes the film so incredible is the fact that Forrest Gump was just a normal guy waiting for the bus, but with a truly amazing story.

His innocence, though, also makes him oblivious to the bad around him. You feel your heart hurting when Forrest's innocence leads him to heartbreak.\nThe acting in this movie is amazing and convincing. Even the characters with only a few lines deliver their lines so well. And Tom Hanks, well, he's Tom Hanks. Incredible actor, everyone knows. I do though, want to really appreciate how well he played Forrest. The voice he had for him was consistent throughout the entire movie, during cheerful and sad scenes. And even the way he walks, acts, the small gestures. All this leads to creating character depth in Forrest.\nMy one complaint in this movie is that they push for too many historical events to happen. Especially during the end. Forrest's story is 70% historical events, and 30% of his actual life. And Jenny's life completely represents historical culture, with nothing personal to her in it.\nIn the end though, this movie is charming and humorous. You see an innocent man grow and change, and hear his humorous narration of major historical events that he lived through. Although this movie isn't one of my absolute favorites, I would watch it again.",

This film teaches you that the simpleton can succeed because he doesn't think too much and doesn't really question the core values of society.  That's sort of an evil lesson.  Good people in this film suffer because they aren't content to accept things as they come ... like being crippled in a war and stuff like that.  Really, to hell with this movie.  Robert Zemeckis is really a terrible director.  There was a time when I was really fond of his output, but perhaps the bulk of that credit should go to Bob Gale.  His direction of this film is about as pedestrian as it comes.  I noticed during the Vietnam War sequences that almost every other shot was just a row of guys walking in a line.

            "content": "Rock n' Roll, Woodstock,and Vietnam. We've all heard about these these incidents whether it was in our history class or from experience. Now, imagine we go back in time and relive these moments that changed our nation's history from the 50's to the 90's. Can you see it? Well how about reliving it through the eyes of a man who has a below average IQ of 75.\n\n    Forrest Gump is a simple-minded man with not the brightest brain. Although being as simple as he is, Forrest finds himself floating through different historical events that doesn't seem to affect him. Such events as the Civil Rights Movement, Ping Pong Diplomacy, John Lennon's Assassination, Watergate Scandal, and countless other phenomenons of our history's culture. With touching the many lives of the people he meets along the way; you can't help to smile, laugh, love and even cry when meeting this remarkable man from Greenbow, Alabama. \n\n    The main character, Forrest Gump, is played by none other than the academy-winning actor Tom Hanks. Hanks stretches how elaborately versatile acting can be when given a character so straightforward and child-like. From his delivery of speech to the way he portrays himself, he makes you believe that you are actually being introduced to this extraordinarily naive man. Even when it comes to comedic or dramatic affairs in the film, Hanks delivers it to his full potential and performs it as we would expect Forrest would. \n\nAlong with an exuberant cast, Gary Sinise plays the supporting role of Forrest's Lieutenant from Vietnam and eventually a life-long friend. His character, known as Lieutenant Dan, believes he has a certain purpose in life. But upon meeting Forrest he soon finds his own destiny has been shaken by him. From showing raw emotions of a paralyzed war vet to warm companionship of a best friend Ginise has us fooled, along with Hanks, by making us believe there are no limits when it comes to acting. \n\nNot only was the acting beautifully displayed, but so was the cinematography and film editing. Being that this film goes through our nation's history, there are real clips of our past moments that were once captured on film with Forrest edited in it; such events as Integration and talking to the President (JFK and Nixon). Even though it may not be completely accurate, the film editing flawlessly captured these moments with Forrest interacting within our history. And the cinematography beautifully captured some of the most breathtaking landscapes that can be found in our country.  \n\nEven more so, the editors added popular music of the specific time period into the film which added to effect of actually being there. From Elvis controversially introducing Rock n' Roll in the 50's to The Bee Gees grooving to disco in the 70's, it brilliantly enhanced people's' reactions in the given moments.\n\nAlong with the brilliant use of music comes the superb directing done by Robert Zemeckis. At the time he had little no background of directing dramas, however he does it surprisingly well. By encapturing various scenes so unforgettable and simply extravagant, he created one of the most beautiful stories ever told. \nWith all of these highly acclaimed features of the movie it's no wonder that it won 6 academy awards, including best picture. It became a picture, no, a story that touched our hearts in the sweetest way. Forrest Gump may have had an IQ of a child at best, but he is nothing less than remarkable. His story is one that is highly achieved and incredibly hard to believe; almost to the point that you have to see it in order to believe it.",

He drifts through the events of his time like the feather that oh so metaphorically dances with the wind thoughout the film.  You have to hope that Zemekis intended Forrest to be hated, but his film craft would lead you otherwise.  \n\nThis film is certainly delightful, and has quite the sense of humor.  It's acted well, and it's even written well.  But the myriad of circumstances that unfold throughout the film makes you wonder what this is supposed to be.  Is it a dream?  Or a farce?  What does Forrest want, other than the childhood innocence that Jenny grew out of years before?  We'll never know, and we probably shouldn't want to either.

I think that in their adult lives Jenny used and manipulated Forrest in every chance she got. I really hate her character. There is a scene which I loathed where Forrest touches Jenny's breast. Imagine if the gender roles where reversed where the male takes sexual advantage of a woman who's IQ is below the norm. The reason I'm giving this movie 3 stars is that you don't see Tom Hanks in the role but you seem to be watching a real person and that is the greatest compliment that an actor can receive.",

References were made in all forms of media, people were quoting the lines on a daily basis, even a restaurant chain was born from its fame. Coming back to view it now, separated from all the hysteria that surrounded it, I find myself significantly less impacted by the story. Suddenly I find inserting Tom Hanks into archived footage with presidents to be a little cheesy. Those lines that gained such fame start to grate on me because I've heard them so many times now. It's not a fault in the movie, I just can't mentally turn back time to recapture the wonder. That being said, clearly there was something special that touched the nation so significantly to get me to this point. Although it's worth mentioning that even when it was brand new I was never totally in love with this film.\n\nForrest Gump is still a nice story, so I don't want to totally criticize it. What works most for me now is the contrast of Forrest's top tier life with that of Jenny and Lieutenant Dan who continue to hit rock bottom. If you actually think about it the lesson of the movie is a bit strange. Don't think, do what you're told, and life will fall into place? But I'm not sure if Forrest's life was supposed to be any kind of moral lesson, and thankfully he never says anything to elevate himself above others. Despite the extremely detailed walk through history, in reality this movie becomes a love story. Every moment spent in that love story is excellent, and I kind of wish Forrest didn't go so many long stretches without coming into contact with Jenny. Perhaps my biggest complaint about Forrest Gump is the amount of little moments in history they try to shoehorn into his life. It's fine when he's competing as an all-american football player, but inventing t-shirts and bumper stickers? It gets ludicrous after awhile and continuously reminds me I'm just watching a movie. I can watch Forrest Gump if someone wants to, but I'm probably never going to choose it.",

With Captain Dan railing against God thru a storm, and the deeper satisfaction found afterwards - a solid theme visited by many characters here and translated to us, the audience, as an offering of the way to inner peace thru such forgiveness -\nI found that a transcendent and revelatory theme.\n\nDespite the craftsmanship of famous historical scenes being edited with Gump in them, I found these creative, but tedious when they should have been humorous. Simply hiccups in a solid film.\n\n Throughout, I still was impressed by many elements of the story commenting on our American culture in those times. \nThe duality of the army culture vs the civilian culture, the high divorce rate and impending sadness of the 70s into the 80s, and Forrest taking up running to deal w the break up - all these were experienced by me and my family. I found that secretly cathartic, helping me see that it was not a singular experience to me, and that even this filmmaker understood it. Bravo Mr. Zemekis! You touch a soul here, and I'm grateful.\n\nAnother stirring scene was early in the film when Jenny revisits her dilapidated childhood home, and inadvertently revisits her dilapidated childhood, throwing rocks at the house as an emotional statement - brilliantly cathartic in its powerful, poetic imagery.\n\nDespite some faults, it's a solid, powerful, emotional film well executed and resonant to its audience.\n\n4 famous boxed chocolates out of 5",

This in turn, has made the movie become a part of American culture as well. After 20 years, the film is still quite good, but does it hold up? While there are problems with the film, there is no doubt denying that the movie is well-recognized into popular culture; even if one has not seen this movie, it is still recognized for what it is worth. \"Forrest Gump\" is an entertaining movie that despite the problems, people need to see at least once in their lives.\n\nThe story involves a man named Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), sitting on a park bench, waiting for the bus to arrive. As time passes, he tells random strangers his life story. This includes him becoming both a football and ping pong hero, becoming the captain of a shrimp boat, serving in the army, and running across the country. All the while, Forrest falls in love with Jenny (Robin Wright), the girl of his dreams, for whom he is waiting at the bench. And that's all I have to say about that.\n\n\"Forrest Gump\" is definitely a good movie to enjoy. The story, based off the book by Winston Groom, is a simple and humble tale about a man who not all that smart, but he sure made an impact. The dialogue is notable for having some quotable lines, and the conversations that are taken place feel like they are straight out of an adult conversation. Robert Zemeckis, who directed the feature, did a great job at handling everything, both on and off the set. The acting is particularly incredible, most notably from Hanks, who won an Oscar for his performance; the supporting cast does a fine job as well, and should not be forgotten. Alan Silvestri provides a nice and calming score, while the soundtrack provides some nice rock n roll tunes. Finally, the movie has some great special effects for the time.\n\nHowever, there are some problems with the film in general. For one thing, while the story is nice, there are a lot of questions being raised while watching the movie that are left unanswered. For example, near the end of the movie, Jenny gets sick, which ultimately leads to her death. Why couldn't she tell Forrest the truth, instead of leaving the answer ambiguous to the viewer? A minor nitpick is that the film can be a bit overrated because it definitely shown its age, but it's still a good film. Also, there are a lot of historical inaccuracies which will pull the hairs out of historians who see the movie.\n\nIn the end, \"Forrest Gump\", while suffering from problems, has maintained a certain cultural status amongst the general public, but it cannot be denied that it is a good movie nonetheless. This is definitely a movie that needs to be seen, even if you have already seen it.",

The character of Forrest is one you really do root for through your the course of the story. It's a very unique and well directed film, with a great original screenplay. It's charming and entertaining. Sometimes it does become a little overly sentimental, and the story gets a bit silly at times. The movie is consistently engaging and well made movie. It is one of a kind, but never becomes too far fetched. It is a simple and effective story of a lower intelligence man who finds he possesses a great deal of talents.But Forrest Gump is a smartly made and re-watchable movie that even tugs at a few heart strings. Forrest Gump gets 4.5/5 stars (A).",

            "content": "An at times overly sentimental favorite that just keeps running, Forrest, running, Gump & Company still says very little but nevertheless maintains its aw shucks charm and history-retelling whimsy in the post-9/11 age. Though the film panders too much to a Disney-fied sense of nostalgia and romanticism, there's no denying the compelling decades spanning narrative, murky message and all. Yes, Forrest Gump proves childlike and syrupy, but so does the title character, which all involved knew all too well and played to the hilt. What this collective gets wrong, however, is in insisting that the film is weightier than it actually is. There appears to be a heavy-handedness but where does it lead the audience?  To the fact that ignoring the harsh realities of life paints a dishonest historical portrait? Regardless, it's an intriguing concept that's beautifully presented and amazingly acted. Ridiculously ambitious, this often offbeat but always entertaining gem mostly hits the mark. At times, Groom's story as adapted by Eric Roth seems like a blue collar Zelig. Woody Allen's 1982 mockumentary at least ruminated on individuality and American ideals amid the historic cameos.\r\n\r\nIn this 20th anniversary re-release of the Oscar winning PG-13-rated dramedy based on Winston Grooms celebrated novel, simpleton Forrest Gump (Hanks) accidentally finds himself present at many historic moments while searching for his true love, Jenny (Robin Wright). \r\n\r\nHaving crafted Back to the Future into the almost quintessential time travel classic and Who Framed Roger Rabbit? into the greatest live action-animation mash-up ever, Robert Zemekis handles the epic scope and monumental scale special effects (still quite effective, mind) with a strong but ingeniously creative hand. Sure, he creates an easy-to-swallow feel-good pill but - without a suitable actor to play the main man - this would all be for naught. Thankfully, Tom Hanks gives a nuanced performance of a very simple man.  When he finds out that he has a son and tears up in asking if the boy is as 'slow' as his father, the result proves heartbreaking, heart-tugging, and heart-soaring in just mere words. It's a masterful turn, perfectly played such that any impressionable qualities get overshadowed but his eternal heart and optimism. Corny? Yes. Forgettable? Not a chance.\r\n\r\nBottom line: Super is as Super does",

They represent a majority of the film's enduring identity, with a certain amount of charm attributed to the seamy, not-quite-there execution of the archival footage, but it's often a case of too much of a good thing. His silly contributions during the continent-spanning run that seals the second act are particularly egregious - good for a very quick snort, but ultimately damaging to the story at large. It's got a big, heavy heart though, and that carries it a long way. Tom Hanks, of course, is to thank for a great deal of that, but Gary Sinise is almost just as good in his cigar-chomping, world-loathing, hat-hanging support role as Lieutenant Dan. A one-of-a-kind classic that may have been just a smidge overrated at the time it was released, its cornerstone scenes still hold up very well and the classic cast of characters may as well be family at this point.",

            "content": "Forrest Gump is the kind of film that shouldn't work on any level.  It's as manipulative as a film can ever be, pulling strings and begging the audience to cry, and the entire event is drowned in sticky-sweet syrup.  And yet - incredibly - Forrest Gump truly works.  It is not without flaw - in fact, it would be nearly impossible to count down all of its many problems - but this film succeeds in being an entertaining, whimsical, and - at times - quite beautiful portrayal of life, love, and 20th century America.  And while one would be quick to point to director Robert Zemeckis in regards to the film's success, or perhaps Eric Roth's screenplay, or even Winston Groom's book upon which the film is based, I think the reason this film works, is because of Tom Hank's legendary performance as the title character.\n\nForrest Gump is a slow-witted Alabama native.  But indeed, he has extraordinary talent, and an intriguing life story to tell to whoever will sit next to him at the bus-stop.  \n\nDespite being embraced by - seemingly - everyone, Forrest Gump actually fared less well than critics.  It holds a 72% on Rotten Tomatoes, which is a good score, but not a great one.  This is largely because Forrest Gump will not appeal to the cynical.  And Lord knows that film critics get enough hate as it is, but there's simply no two ways about it: Film critics, generally speaking, are more cynical than the average movie-goer.  Those willing to accept the occasionally preposterous nature of the film and the sometimes cloying sentimental tone will find a lot to enjoy.  But if you've never quite cottoned to the sappier efforts of Steven Spielberg or renaissance Disney, you may find Forrest Gump to be an eternal 142 minutes.\n\nOne of the problems with Forrest Gump is that the film goes to exceedingly great lengths to make Forrest as endearing and likable as possible.  And honestly, it wasn't necessary; he's already a likable character.  Additionally, Forrest Gump just seems to be an expert at everything.  When we learn he's an incredibly fast runner, we buy that.  But after we learn he's incredible at putting guns together, playing ping-pong, etc., things get a little stale.\n\nOn top of that, Forrest Gump also has a running gag in which Forrest turns out to be the originator of several pop culture staples, from one of Elvis Presley's dance moves, to the creator of the \"smiley\" face, etc.  Forrest Gump spends so much time winking at the audience, one begins to ponder the likelihood of contracting an eye-lid blister.\n\nIn spite of the film's many problems, however, Forrest Gump is a good film, largely thanks to Tom Hanks.  His performance adds an element of genuineness and sincerity to the picture, thus balancing the syrupy sap.  On paper, the Forrest Gump character comes off as cloying, but when you see Tom Hanks portray this character, it not only works, it comes to life.  This is not a case of a great performance making a decent film worth seeing.  This is a great performance that elevates everything surrounding it.  It gives the movie a classy nature that makes the sentiment feel earned.\n\nThere are genuine moments of beauty and grace.  In fact, some sequences are almost stunningly beautiful.  When the film eases back a little on the sweetness, it has an old-fashioned appeal to it, and an unmistakable charm in the aesthetics of the picture.\n\nThe visual effects are superb.  Forrest Gump seamlessly blends with the archival footage in an effect that still holds up today.  Even more impressive - to my eyes, anyway - is the effect used for a character who has lost his legs in the war, and must function without them.\n\nI've already praised Hanks' performance, but the rest of the cast is worth noting too.  Robin Wright plays Forrest's love interest, Jenny, in a more serious role.  She captures the depth of the character, and is never as annoying as she might have been in less capable hands.  Gary Sinise as Dan Taylor delivers a performance that's absolutely marvelous, and even giving Hanks a bit of a run for his money.  Sinise's performance is powerful and gripping.  Sally Fields portrays the most charming of the cast, Forrest's mother, in a sweet but memorable supporting role.  Michael Conner Humphreys and Hanna R. Hall portray young Forrest and young Jenny respectively in excellent child performances.\n\nAlan Silvestri's score is very pretty, but it receives an absurdly little amount of screen time.  It gets two major appearances (other than the credits), and that is the very beginning, and the very end.  You hardly hear it at all the rest of the film, which is largely populated with obnoxious, time-period-accurate, pop and rock songs.  While they are interesting from a stylistic point of view, they are simply atrocious from a musical one.  They end up stealing a lot of screen time that would have been better served by Silvestri's much more palatable musical score.\n\nForrest Gump is heavily flawed, but it has some wonderful moments.  Tom Hanks gives the performance of his life, and despite too much sweetness at times, the film is a real charmer.  The acting is great, the screenplay is great, the score is great, and the characters are great.  The over-sentimentality brings the film down a bit at times, but it's hard to imagine that too many people would leave Forrest Gump without feeling at least a little better about life.",

The writing is kind of clever in how it weaves Forrest's life through several major events of the latter half of the 20th century, but it's also a little too happenstance.  Yet it's such a fantastical story, and is told with such a sense of whimsy, that it's hard not to be charmed by it.  Featuring Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, and Sally Field, the cast is quite impressive.  And the soundtrack is extraordinary, really capturing the various times and places of Forrest's adventures.  While Forrest Gump tends to be a little too quirky and lighthearted for its own good, overall it's still incredibly entertaining and fun.",

The screenplay by Eric Roth is heartfelt. And the score in this movie I personally love the score because it gave a heartwarming vibe to it. And the effects are excellent. \"I'm raving that \"Forrest Gump\" is the movie triumph that became a phenomenon.\"",

Its been 20 years since it came out, but I loved it even as I watched it for the first time in 2014.

Tom Hanks won an Oscar for best actor in his role as Forrest Gump and was able to bring life and believability to his character in a way that only he could do. The storyline begins and ends with a symbolic feather floating endlessly to tell the story of the life of the simple and charming Forrest Gump.  As Forrest revisits his childhood beginning in 1952 when he got leg braces put on which he referred to as his \"magic legs\" which leads him to hip dancing with a young Elvis Presley who later steals his moves and is televised doing the dance. In 1961 Forrest goes to college and makes the All-American Team while playing football at the University of Alabama and he meets President John F. Kennedy. While he is in college the University becomes one of the first to be desegregated and Forrest makes an appearance on the news when he is shown picking up the books of one of the first black students to attend the school. In 1966 Forrest enters the Vietnam War where he is awarded a medal of honor presented by President Johnson. The story continues through the 80's and includes many historical events in between. Film editing included live action film with actual footage from the white house to simulate Forrest at the white House, this was done in many scenes adding to the realness of the movie. \"Mama always said life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get,\" a symbolic quote from the movie sends the message that regardless of the situations Forrest found himself in he stayed true and humble to his southern beginnings.",

Tom Hanks plays the title character, a mysterious, kind-hearted man sitting at a park bench, telling random strangers the story of his life. Hanks gives himself over to the role, providing a charm to the simple minded man. Set alongside some of the most pivotal moments in American history, Zemeckis is not afraid to place his main character's image in actual archival footage, creating an authenticity to the stories that Forrest tells. Gary Sinise gives a career highlight turn as Lieutenant Dan. Because of its blend between comedy and real life events, with sincerity and depth in both the performances and the screenplay, \"Forrest Gump\" remains a benchmark in American cinema.",

He won millions of dollars from a shrimp boating business. But his (possible) destiny is to live happily with childhood friend Jenny (Robin Wright). He tells most of the story to people at a bus stop, who laugh at and perhaps pity Forrest because of his clinical stupidity. Everything that happens in Forrest's life is preposterous enough to keep me interested, but I couldn't stop wondering what the point of the film was. There's a vague theme about destiny represented by a feather. Luckily, Forrest spells it out for the audience. Trust your instincts and see where they take you. However, even Forrest's mother could not explain what \"destiny\" is. Tom Hanks was fine and played a respectful portrayal of the mentally handicapped Forrest, but did he really deserve an Oscar for this one? (That's rhetorical. I don't care anymore about to what and whom the Old Fart Academy awards.) Nothing about Forrest Gump, the movie, shattered my expectations or touched my heart. I'm only grateful that it inspired the lost gem of a Weird Al parody, \"Gump.\"",

It goes from when he was just a little boy to who he is now. He had a lot happen in his life, not to mention that he is mentally retarded. \nThe story starts out as Forrest when he was younger and how he had trouble getting into a public school because he wasn't has smart because he was mentally retarded but his mother convinced the principal. Forrest was made fun of but he had his best friend and only friend Jenny. When Forrest was older he played college football because he was good at it, he could run very fast. Then he went into the army made a friend Bubba but Bubba died, he won the Congressional Medal of Honor. Then he went home and saw Jenny and was with each other for a while then one morning she just left.  Forrest got into the shrimping business and made a lot of money. He went on a run through the U. S. because he could. Couple years later he met up with Jenny and found out he had a son bout 6 years old. Turns out Jenny had cancer and died but Forrest and his son lived happily down the road. \nThere's Forrest, Forrest's Mama, Jenny, Bubba and Lieutenant Dan. They were all the main characters. All played a big role in the movie. \n  There are many different settings throughout the movie. Forrest's house, Vietnam, on a shrimp boat, on a road traveling through the United States, and many different places. Many important places throughout the movie. \nI think it is one of the best movies of all time. It funny and has a really good story to it. I'll give it a 5/5.",

There's an abundance of \"try not to cry\" moments, and the final ten minutes leave me with the most stinging heartache every time.

The film, is charming, well-acted and plays on Forrest's, \"smartness\". Robin Wright Penn is alright too, but Hanks always steals the scene; basically every scene. Sally Field's Mrs Gump is a wonderfully tender and quotable character, amazingly acted, while Gary Sinise's war veteran oozes pain in the most elegantly tragic way, and too, Mykelti Williamson's eagerly shrimped-out Bubba Blue is wonderful too. But maybe the most important part of the film's production is the special effects team, who, even if Gump had been played by a bad actor, would have still given Forrest Gump a sweet nostalgic feeling. \n\nLet's just say, Forrest Gump, overall, is a nostalgic, charming, well-acted tear-jerker that   is wonderful in every way.

It's a film that deftly mixes nearly every genre into one epic tale, yet never shies away from the importance of small moments. But with this much love, cynicism and (some deserved) scorn aren't far behind: terms like \"on-the nose\" and \"syrupy sweet\" come to mind. But what's the advantage of this cynicism when it's so rewarding to just sit back and enjoy? At its core, Gump is pure Hollywood magic that deserves to be treasured.\nEssentially a biopic of a fictional character, Gump is first-person-perspective storytelling with a protagonist who sees much but perceives little...at least not in the same way we do. Swimming in historical fiction and even magical realism, he impacts American history: presidents are met, classic songs are heard, Vietnam wars are fought...yet Forrest's gaze is set on one thing: love. It's silly and whimsical, yet consistently surprising to see Forrest navigate through life with such sincerity and tenacity.\nLest we neglect how technically impeccable the film is. The aesthetic is simplistic and gorgeous, and the effects (missing limbs, altered historical footage) are light years ahead of what they should be. But these things are rarely mentioned because they aren't the point. Zemeckis wants the movie to be the same as its hero: simple, random, sincere. Gump's unconditional love, overwhelming kindness, and na\u00efve determination got him wherever he needed to be, and that journey leaves him and us in stitches, while never abandoning hope. Manipulative? Maybe...or maybe it's just great filmmaking.",

It has this realistic and magical mood that I don't quite have anything to compare it to, like, it shows this amazing life this person had and how much he learned from it, and how much he inspired people while doing simple things without even knowing it, but it doesn't break the boundaries of reality. The story ventures into many areas while revisiting events of the past, making it quite familiar, but also dropping you in to possibly get a feel for things that have happened or what it was like during the time. At the end, everything is tied up and understood, we've learned something, saw some action, some terror and some drama. The movie has so much to offer and is extremely satisfying.",

His story is told through a combination of na\u00efve innocence, cultural strife, and social influence.  The film did a great job mixing it's an emotionally in-depth story with thoroughly detailed characters.

Ou que tem uma das hist\u00f3rias mais divertidas e emocionantes de todos os tempos. N\u00e3o h\u00e1 o que dizer sobre este filme, que para mim, \u00e9 um dos grandes trabalhos cinematogr\u00e1ficos de todos os tempos.\nTalvez o mais incr\u00edvel em \"Forrest Gump\" \u00e9 que o roteiro de Eric Roth (principalmente o roteiro) e a dire\u00e7\u00e3o de Robert Zemeckis se desenvolvem de acordo com a mentalidade do Forrest, ou seja, h\u00e1 cenas meio infantis, di\u00e1logos meio bobos (\"Idiota \u00e9 quem faz idiotice\"; \"Forrest, corre!\") e at\u00e9 mesmo o desenrolar da trama \u00e9 t\u00e3o inocente e puro (igual a mentalidade do protagonista) que o resultado final se assemelha a um conto de fadas. Na realidade, este filme \u00e9 um conto de fadas sobre um garoto com problemas mentais que consegue muitas conquistas ao longo de sua vida enquanto enfrenta importantes acontecimentos da hist\u00f3ria americana, como por exemplo a luta de Martin Luther King pelos direitos dos afro-americanos, a terr\u00edvel Guerra do Vietnam, a morte de pessoas importantes na hist\u00f3ria dos EUA (como a do Presidente Kennedy e a do John Lennon), entre outros. Estas datas hist\u00f3ricas s\u00e3o t\u00e3o bem retratadas no filme, que o Zemeckis consegue contar toda a hist\u00f3ria americana dos anos cinquenta at\u00e9 os anos noventa em menos de duas horas e meia: algo de extrema compet\u00eancia. \nA interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o de Tom Hanks como o Forrest \u00e9 absolutamente encantadora. Sua express\u00e3o doce e pura e a sua recita\u00e7\u00e3o maravilhosa o levaram a ganhar o \u00d3scar de Melhor Atua\u00e7\u00e3o Masculina no ano de 1994. Al\u00e9m disto, \"Forrest Gump\" tem \u00f3timos e discretos efeitos especiais (que tamb\u00e9m venceram o \u00d3scar), uma trilha sonora arrebatadora, e sem falar do roteiro que opta em seguir a capacidade mental de seu protagonista com o m\u00e1ximo de compet\u00eancia.\n\u00c9 um filme extremamente maravilhoso, um cl\u00e1ssico dos nossos tempos e tem uma das hist\u00f3rias mais belas e mais bem contadas entre todas j\u00e1 produzidas por Hollywood. N\u00e3o tem como n\u00e3o se emocionar e n\u00e3o gostar!",

Very few things can even come close.\n\nGump, played by an astounding Tom Hanks, is set up to look and seem like someone who isn't quite smart. Indeed, his principle tells his mom that poor young Forrest's IQ level is below normal.\n\nTo which his mother replies, \"Well, what is normal, anyway?\"\n\nSuch is the journey of this amazing movie. It is a comedy. Or a drama. Or some kind of dream, some kind of realization. A feeling. A state of mind.\n\nIt begins with Gump sitting on a bench at a bus stop. He starts to tell his story to anyone who will listen, and even some that don't. The former group includes us.\n\nWe are instantly hooked. The thing about Forrest Gump is that he's just SO goddamn lovable, we just can't get enough of this guy. \n\nSo he relates his life story to people. It's fantastic, really, the way the movie is done. And many people say that Forrest Gump is a story about an intellectually challenged individual who works hard to make things right. But I don't see it that way.\n\nThis is a boy, and later, a man, who is pure. Not innocent. Pure. He doesn't see the world through the lens society put in front of him. He sees it through his own eyes. In many ways, he's a lot smarter than any of us. He sees the true right and wrong.\n\nOf course, he manages to get himself involved in pretty much all the great historical events spawning the 70s, the 80s, and the 90s, including Watergate, John Lennon, and saving countless lives in Vietnam.\n\nAnd throughout all of this, the star in his life, the one thing that keeps him going, is a girl named Jenny (Robin Wright).\n\nJenny was the girl who let him sit next to her on the first day of school. She defended him from bullies. She opened up to him about her father. They had a special tree they would sit in and talk while on. She's the kind of friend everyone should have but only Forrest Gump did.\n\nA running gag in the movie is that Forrest can run literally like the wind. He uses this to, seemingly without effort, get a football scholarship. He also saves numerous lives in Vietnam (including Lieutenant Dan Taylor, played by Gary Sinise) by simply picking them up and running them to safety.\n\nI cannot stress how good this movie is. It takes the audience on an emotional, intense ride that reaches deep inside us and flicks on a switch we didn't even know was there.\n\nBottom Line: The film was extremely great, thoroughly deserving of the six Oscars it won. It's message is clear: Some people try so hard to fit into the society they are in and live a good life like that. Most of them fail. Forrest, on the other hand, was pure, intelligent, and just tried to be himself, to be what he knew he was. And look where that got him.",

His portrayal or Forrest Gump is as emotionally powerful of the film itself and is his sweetest character. Tom Hanks was absolutely perfect for the role.\nAlso, Robyn Wright and Mykelti Williamson created strong character additions to the story and made it a culturally wide story, but the best support came from Gary Sinise whose talent as an actor vocally can only be overshadowed by his skill at playing a crippled war veteran that we're happy to see just because Forrest is, and his skill at hiding his legs and relying on his arms to do all the work is excellent. His performance is also iconic.\nAlso, there's the always sweet Sally Field in another great performance.\n\nForrest Gump also benefits from Robert Zemeckis' sympathetic way of handling such subject matter, his directional skill and the fact that his film features such an excellent soundtrack. Forrest Gump hits emotionally hard, and makes me cry today for different reasons than it did 6 years ago, and it's just a beautiful film.",

They become the best of friends, but unfortunately Bubba did not have the same luck as Forrest when it came to returning home.

He got a football scholarship, ran for almost 3 years, and met the President of the United States on many occasions. \n\nThis movie was very entertaining. I believe this movie was made to entertain, but also had a bit of a theme. This movie showed a lesson about how you can overcome anything, any obstacle, if you,are willing to be with the one you love. It also shows no matter how dumb you are, or no matter what kind of disability you have, you can accomplish amazing things. \n\nThis film was also amazing because of what went on behind the scenes. If were not for this movies spectacular lighting and camera shots, this movie would not be as good as it was. One of the best camera shots this movie had is when Forrest was visiting his mothers brave, and it was a low angle shot with the light of the sun coming down through the tree. This movie did a great job if keeping the shots interesting to keep the viewer awake. \n\nThis is one of my favorite movies. Mostly because I can relate to most of it. I love this movie because it has drama, romance, it's funny, and it's got action. Although this movie was not based on a true story, Forrest Gump inspires me to go above and beyond what I think I can do.\n\n- CE, 8th Grade Student",

I didn't! I thought it was ludicrous, made my face cringe, and contained dialogue that was so unsophisticated and simple that a one months old would be able to comprehend this film. Seeing Hanks photo shopped into photos and clips with those famous celebrities and events, including the introduction of the black girls into segregated schools of Alabama, is inane. For a man of a 75 IQ to tell an extraordinary tale like that is ludicrous, especially with the limited vocabulary. There are so many questions that also remain, like, what was his major in college or how did he even get into college academically or how did his father die? A good film covers those questions with answers of any sort of way. I do not, will not get this movie, nor its legacy. I have no desire to recommend or watch this movie again. There are MANY better movies from that year of 1994, as well from 1990's, as well as of all years. Just ridiculous this overrated film is! Ugh!",

Zemeckis weaves Hanks into archive footage and his combination of satire and sentimentality is what makes this masterpiece so beautiful and effective.

            "content": "\"Life is like a box of chocolates...You never know what you're gonna get,\" explains Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) in \"Forrest Gump.\"  This quote is especially true throughout; the film shows the trials and tribulations of life through one man's journey.  Director Robert Zemeckis (\"Back to the Future,\" \"Polar Express\") brilliantly captures this quest using major events in 20th century American history.  This production, based on the novel by Winston Groom, seizes viewers' attention with magnificent special effects, extraordinary acting, and a one of a kind plot. \n\nWhen people hear \"special effects,\" explosions are often the first thoughts that come to mind.  And although special effects might not appear to be a part of a movie that portrays a man's life; one always says that looks can be deceiving.  The effects of this movie are what give it astounding character. While there are some explosions throughout, the film's effects go far beyond fiery combustion and into the realm of historic events.  For instance, one scene portrays Forrest meeting and shaking hands with President John F. Kennedy. However, President Kennedy had been assassinated long before this film. The special effects are what allowed scenes like these to be possible in \"Forrest Gump.\"\n\nThis film does not rely on animation alone to create a memorable picture.  The acting displayed in this movie by Tom Hanks (Forrest Gump), Robin Wright (Jenny Curran, Forrest's long-time crush), and Gary Sinise (Lieutenant Dan Taylor, Forrest's Lieutenant in Vietnam), is truly captivating.  With award-winning performances from the whole cast, Hanks still manages to shine above the rest.  Hanks does an exceptional job playing the lead role as Forrest, a man of below-average intelligence who has a deeply compassionate personality. His acting is what captures the audience to feel the emotion of the movie. These occasions present an emotional appeal to the viewers, made possible because of the spectacular acting.\n\nThe last component in making this movie so successful is the plot.  Plot is often one of the key factors in a movie being defined as successful or unsuccessful.  \"Forrest Gump\" works along a specific plot, which becomes apparent throughout the film.  The plot is revealed slowly but surely within a series of flashbacks of Forrest's life during the whole picture.  It accomplishes a difficult task in keeping the audience engaged and pondering its message during its entirety.  The screenplay relies on its moving scenes to create a successful comedy, drama, and action flick all in one.\n\n\"Forrest Gump\" is a provocative tale.  Although the Academy Award-winning storyline is fiction, it incorporates real life scenes and provokes the viewer as he or she watches Forrest in distinctive situations, making them happy, sad, and even angry at times.  It achieves this all while teaching important morals that should be a part of everyone's lives and also giving a mini history lesson.  This picture leaves a lasting impression long after the credits stop rolling.  The audience feels touched by the film \"Forrest Gump\" which has become a classic and audience favorite.",

            "content": "\"My Momma always said that life was like a box of chocolates. You ever know what you are going to get.\" - Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks)\n\nForrest Gump is an absolutely amazing film that was nominated for and won many academy awards. Tom Hanks won the Golden Glove for best actor, and Robert Zemeckis won the olden Globe for best director. Gary Sanise won a few awards for best supporting actor, and was nominated in the same category for a few other awards. It won so many prestigious awards besides Golden Globes too. It truly is one of the greatest and my highly praised films of all time, and it deserves all of it. The film is creative as it gets, and an absolute masterpiece. Part of it's brilliance is how historically accurate it is. Forrest Gump is a perfect mixture of an epic drama, romance, and a drama-comedy. \n\nForrest Gump (Tom Hanks) is a slow-witted man that happens to witness and influence important parts of American history in the 2nd half of the 20th century. Forrest has influenced parts of American history such as teaching Elvis the \"Elvis Pelvis\" dance. His legs were in braces when he was a boy, and he couldn't move them. Elvis was playing a song for him, and he started dancing, but he could only move his pelvis because of the braces. Elvis liked the dance and started to use it. That is the first example of something he influenced in the story.\n\nThe most important part of the story was when he became a war hero. There were a few people that became part of his life that he would influence history with. His friend Bubba who died in the war, who was his best friend he named his shrimp company after. He started the shrimp company \"Bubba Gump\" with Lieutenant Dan (Gary Sinise).\n\nDan had a family member from every generation fight and die in a war, so he feels like that is his destiny. When Forrest saves him he feels like he was cheated out of his destiny. He wanted to die and be honored, but now he doesn't have any legs. He starts to live off of the government, and has lost all faith in God. There is a scene where he is telling Forrest that you cheated me out of my destiny. He was being irrational because it is impossible to be cheated out of a destiny, if God has an exact one planed for you. What Forrest should have said to him is that you are wrong you were destined to survive that war, and in the future you will learn why when all of your pain has passed. I for one don't believe everything is planned. I believe only some things happen for a reason. Certain things I think don't happen for a reason. There is a mix of both, and if everything was planned you wouldn't actually be in control of your life. That is one lesson that Forrest learned at the end.\n\nThe film is also a beautiful romance. Forrest has been in love with his childhood friend Jenny (Robin Wright) ever since he first saw her when he was little. Now that they are adults he wants to be with her, but she is really disturbed. She has become part of the hippy crowd, and she takes a lot of hallucinogens. She gets into many abusive relationships partly because of the damage done from the abusive relationship she had with her father. Her father ruined her life, and everything was sour because of him. She won't be with Forrest because she hates herself, and she loved Forrest too much to hurt him. He doesn't have the intelligence to see that she isn't perfect, or to even see that she is completely flawed. That is the really emotional part of the film, and the romantic part. I like romance in movies as long as it isn't really cheesy stuff, and it is actually deep and emotional. That type of stuff I think is really well acted, and hard to do.\n\nThe film is a hard one to make and to be in, and it is total genius. One of the most creative masterpieces of all time. A classic that will never die.",

Amazing use of special effects that blew my mind and made me want to get into movies. The screenplay is brilliant.",

The cinematography compliments the innocence of the character by putting the viewer on the level of the characters involved. Another aspect that makes this film truly remarkable was the plot itself. It has no real goal, it simply weaves this unlikely character through a tapestry of history, acceptance, and love. Its a truly beautiful story. Robert Zemeckis absolutely swept me off my feet with this film. I've seen many of his films of course, who hasn't, but I was just blown away by this film. Performances by Robin Wright and Tom Hanks are amazing. The chemistry between the two is like a movie romance that we haven't seen in a very long time. Sally Field is another great performance that can't go unnoticed, she is this safety blanket that protects Forrest from the evil of the world. A magnificent landmark cinematic triumph!",

Although he was an under average person Forrest in terms of cognitive functioning, he had plenty of support and nurturing from his mother.\n \nBe yourself, everyone else is already taken\nOscar Wilde\n\nEnemies or people who try to humiliate, intimidate, damage you can turn out to be your most powerful asset, as in the case with forest's bullies who introduced Forrest to college by helping him to lose his leg braces and helped him to obtain his college degree through football, they meant to hurt him and humiliate him, but this forced him to pray and unleash a new Forest. (very parallel to the story of Joseph in the book of Genesis. Genesis 50:20.",

You never know what you're gonna get.\" \u00e2\" Forest Gump.\n\nForest Gump is not just a movie it is art, which bounces around in comedy, romance and drama. The na\u00c3\u00afve life of an individual who touches lives and influences his nation as a whole. Robert Zemeckis balances this movie in such a way that when you think you are getting swayed in the comic area he moves to romance, the moment you start to smile at blind love, he switches to drama/intrigue which captivates you.\n\nThis movie has everything for everybody and its delivery is such that you remember the movie more for the adventures of Gump than his effects on America\u00e2(TM)s history. Many Visual effects were used in the movie to incorporate Gump with historical American footages, like when he met President Kennedy.\n\nThe movie is based on the 1986 novel of the same name by Winston Groom. The book and the movie do have some similarities and differences, the movie itself is based on the first 11 chapters of the book then skips to the end, some of the other occupations that Gump was involved in were omitted. \nSome parts that were not in the book were also added like his need for leg braces, also his autistic level in the book is more than what we see in the movie.\n\nThe film is about an overly naive autistic man, named Forest Gump (Tom Hanks), whose life between his birth and the time he found out about his son Forest Jr. ran through American history, touching lives and influencing others.\n\nThe most interesting thing to me is that Forest Gump was the man responsible for revealing the Water Gate scandal during Nixon\u00e2(TM)s regime (this is bogus mind you).\n\nWinning six out of the thirteen Academy Award nominations, among the six awards, Forest Gump won Best Picture, Best Actor (Tom Hanks) and Best Director (Robert Zemeckis), the movie also won Three Golden Globe awards for Best Drama Picture, Best Actor (Hanks) and Best Director (Zemeckis)\n\nForest Gump was a financial success, recouping more than 10 times is 55 million production cost, this movie has stood the test of time as a classic that all should have in the shelves. It is also recognized by the American film Institute, The film ranks 37th on their 100 Years...100 Cheers and 76th on their 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition). \n\nwww.lagsreviews.com",
