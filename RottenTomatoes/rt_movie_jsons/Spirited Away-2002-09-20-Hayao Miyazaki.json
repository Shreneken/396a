Thru incredibly patient detail, Ghibli's artists bring to life everything from accurately portraying the feelings and physical movement of a young girl, to landscapes and environments full of detail that are so typical of the respect given by Japanese Shinto. But more importantly, the story in \"Spirited Away\" addresses the hallmark issues of modern Japan; issues which are incredibly human, and universal.\n\nA coming of age story, this animated movie brings to light almost all the important challenges that we face today: Everything from bravery in the face of disaster, the value of generosity and friendship, respect and patience for others... I continue to draw inspiration and see depth in this film years after having first seen it. \n\nJapanese culture is known to be one of hard work and excellence, and \"Spirited Away\" presents that solitary, dedicated life to a tee. Another great theme in Japanese culture is the important ability to befriend enemies and adapt to change. But perhaps it's greatest insight: that whatever you have lived, no matter if forgotten, stays with you and empowers you, is perhaps this movie's most important lesson. One that is transmitted with the greatest care and consideration; something that is deeply lacking in our society today.\n\n\"Spirited Away\" is a shining example of excellence in story telling, and will stand as a benchmark for filmmakers for ages to come.",

            "content": "This will be my last review for 2022. Where do I even begin? If I ever did a Top 10 list with the greatest films I have ever seen, Spirited Away would easily be in the top 5. It is, undoubtedly, one of the greatest Japanese films I've seen, one of the greatest animated films, and certainly of the greatest films I have ever seen in my life. Probably one of the best of all time, as well. In contrast to Pixar and Disney, who already suffer from sequel/spinoff fatigue, repetitive themes and familiar plots (that elicit the same feelings all the time), Studio Ghibli manages to create true experiences. I don't mean to blame Pixar or Disney (they are both excellent in their own right), but movies from Studio Ghibli always make me feel something, whether that is happiness, sadness, awe, fear, melancholy, anger. Their animation is beautiful, absolutely gorgeous eye candy. Their characters (mostly female heroines) are always fleshed out and well developed. The plotlines are stupidly profound and engaging. The themes they present are relevant and thought provoking. I almost don't want to watch them, because I'm overcome with sadness when I realize that the beautiful adventure I witness will be over soon. Studio Ghibli are special. Their works communicate with the viewer, they make the strongest viewers (of every age, that is) sentimental, they make you feel like a child. They make you proud to still enjoy animation. They are timeless masterpieces. And Japanese cinema overall (along with Italian) is the only one that makes me so emotional. As for the movie itself, I cannot say much, because this is an experience that shouldn't be spoiled. The animation is astonishing, the characters lovely (I absolutely adore Kamaji and I would die for him), the story intriguing, Chihiro herself is a perfect protagonist because of her imperfections. Needless to say that the soundtrack created by auteur Joe Hisaishi is wonderful (I love his works very much and I consider him equal to John Williams). Hayao Miyiazaki himself makes perfect use of the story and Japanese folklore to convey a strong story of courage and determination. He is currently one of my favorite directors. I plan on watching Studio Ghibli's other works in the near future. For now, I recommend that you all stop what you're doing and go watch this masterpiece. This is what true cinema looks like",

It is a very unique and intriguing story that makes you wonder if it was a legend that people passed down from generation to generation. I also really enjoyed the music in the film. Beautiful pieces of sound that brought a different life to the film. Overall, it helped me think in a different way than I had before I watched the film.

Her family is in the process of moving to the suburbs, and they explore the nearby area when they make a wrong turn getting to their new house.  It turns out to be quite the fateful event because Chihiro soon finds herself in a spell-filled world of spirits.  When her parents transform into pigs, it's all up to her to find a remedy and form an escape plan.  Now anime is admittedly a big blind spot for me.  For years I dug my feet in and refused to watch it because there's such an extensive number of options that I didn't know where to start.  It's the same reason I've never really explored Bollywood.  However, I am making small steps to fix that, and I am currently enjoying the ride with my first series, Evangelion.  I decided to watch arguably the most acclaimed anime movie of all time, and Spirited Away is nothing short of wonderful.  Now, even though I am pretty green with anime, this is one of maybe two anime features I've watched in the past.  It was back when I started seriously getting into movies, so I would guesstimate that to be about fifteen years ago.  After all, I was looking at lists like the IMDb top 250 at the time, and this is universally rated highly, so why wouldn't I watch it?  I'm pretty sure I watched the dubbed version at the time, which is not something I did this time around.  Rewatching this was a great experience because I remembered next to nothing about it other than that image of a train ride with the masked character, so it was like I was watching it with fresh eyes.  Right away, this story entices you with mystery.  Sure, these are kind of terrible parents, but their shortcomings are the means to take you to this incredibly well-thought-out world.  They do a fantastic job of pulling you in because they don't take any time at all to lay out the rules.  This is a land where literally anything can happen, and you have to go along for the ride.  Oh, the parents are pigs now?  You don't have time to think about it because now there are ghosts, talking frogs, and a man with six extendable arms.  You can call this the Japanese Alice in Wonderland, and that would be fairly accurate.  I would argue that this is far more substantial because there is so much more character growth that comes with interesting character choices that are made throughout.  The world-building in this is nothing short of incredible, and this is a place that feels lived in at every turn.  This is a movie that fires on all cylinders.  The animation is standout, the score is terrific, and the pacing is taut.  Even if you were like the old me and resisted anime, you should make an exception for this one.",

Western clothes in clear contrast to the traditional uniform she wears once she \"becomes\" Sen.\nThe change coincides with the meeting with Yub\u0101ba who, thanks to a magic spell capable of stealing identities and memories, takes part of her name away (\u5343 Sen is the first character of \u5343\u5c0b Chihiro).\nThe dualism in \"Spirited Away\" (tradition and modernity, East and West) represents a strong conflict that converges in a profound crisis of identity. Haku is unable to remember his real name; No-Face is looking for a place to stay and be accepted; the River Spirit needs to be purified in order to return to its original form.\nThe confused cultural hybridism disorients and frightens the young protagonist who, however, finds the determination and the courage to assert herself and accomplish her coming-of-age. Chihiro/Sen will go back to wearing her old clothes, reaffirming her Westernized identity, but only after having rediscovered her roots, Japanese tradition, and the intrinsic authenticity of her physical and spiritual journey.\nIn \"Spirited Away\" we find all the themes dear to Miyazaki: environmentalism, socialism, the ambiguity of good and evil. But, also, the critique of capitalism and globalization, which deprives the meaning of imported ideas and discredits the local ones.\nBut \"Spirited Away\" is also, and above all, a visually splendid, delicate, rich and sincere film; perfectly edited and marvelously portrayed by its animated characters. It is a masterpiece of craftsmanship that finally consecrates Miyazaki's genius internationally, not only for animation but for cinema in general, spreading his aesthetic throughout the world.",

The landscapes and food in Studio Ghibli movies always appear sublime. Chihiro (Daveigh Chase), a ten-year-old who is lashing out because she doesn't want to move, is thrust into the dreamscape after only a few minutes in an abandoned amusement park \u2014 her parents (Michael Chiklis & Lauren Holly) gorge themselves on unattended food, quickly morphing into ravenous pigs. Spirited Away nails the subtlety of intertwining overarching issues \u2014 environmentalism, consumerism, modernity vs. tradition \u2014 into the whimsical coming-of-age story. Kamaji (David Ogden Stiers), \"the spider-man,\" is the epitome of a Ghibli character \u2014 he's supernatural with an arch in his relationship with our protag and possesses a big heart. There are countless scenes where Miyazaki flexes his animation muscles, but my favorite comes with Haku (Jason Marsden) when he's in dragon form. It'd been a decade since I last watched this movie and it reminded me of what had made it so special. 20 years later, Spirited Away is still a must-watch and (so far) my favorite Studio Ghibli story.",

Director: Hayao Miyazaki, Kirk Wise.Producer: Donald W. Ernst, Toshio Suzuki\nWriter: Hayao Miyazaki. The work received many awards and nominations for the Oscars and for good reason. Hayao Miyazaki tells the story of a girl who quietly got into the magical world and saved her childhood friend and parents from a sorceress.I want to notice how the world of spirits displays the emotional experiences of the girl and how filigree the director was able to show them.After the parents move, \u0422hihiro enters the world of spirits, the parents mutate into piglets and the girl gets a job with the witch, saves the spirit of the river, breaks the curse. The tale is somewhat similar to the fairy tale Alice in Wonderland. An excellent combination of animation and frame detail, you can catch any freeze frame and the picture will be beautiful. Smooth movements achieved by hours of work were not in vain, along with perfectly matched composition, the picture came out excellent.

This is coming from someone who was delighted by Howl's Moving Castle, blown away by Princess Mononoke, emotionally devastated by Grave of the Fireflies and touched by the simplicity of The Cat Returns all but to name a few. Spirited Away is a mystical, charming and truly enchanting animated fantasy, even with the long length and some slow moments. The animation is absolutely stunning, both the hand drawn visuals and the CGI graphics give an ethereal charm to the film. The characters move more than convincingly and the colours are beautiful. The music is also outstanding, I loved the simplicity of the piano and the drama of the more dramatic parts. The story is a pleasure, I know people have complained of some loose ends, but it is an original, touching and charming one I feel. I also loved the characters. Chihiro, voiced with real enthusiasm by Daveigh Chase, is sulky to begin with, but she is also brave and resourceful, traits I like in young heroines. Lin is kind and sympathetic, and Susan Egan who was also in Porco Rosso was unusually sensitive as the character. Jason Marsden is charming as Haku, and Suzanne Pleshette is perfect as the grotesque Yubaba and as her sister Zeniba. Overall, I loved Spirited Away, it is really charming. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

There are many things that I gain it from watching this animation.Whether it be, great characters, that change positively throughout or climax scene which so outstanding. And a little weirdness, which keeps it interesting.That I said, I also can't wait to show it to my friends or other who never watch it before. I know they will respond to the depth of feeling and art and just good storytelling. If you watch it maybe kids or older will find it fun and heartwarming. There is excitement without seeing violence (though the giant baby does threaten, and the dragon shows up hurt badly). Cannot recommend highly enough. Spirited away is the all time blockbuster movie.This movie has great role models and messages. Great for kids who love weirdness ,and I think every all of ages can watch it Just not for overly sensitive kids.\n\nThis animation are using the 2d hand drawing all of movie ,and you will see most of place and building tone is red and orange color palettes.And the director make a noteworthy character such as No face and Susuwatari. No-face and Susuwatari are the most popularity characters of this animation that is referenced of many stuffs such as stationary,accessories or clothing etc.If you talk about what is the director's propose,I will conclude it for you.From my opinion,Spirited Away is an imaginative fantasy film. and can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Since there are several layers of content and difficulties.There are a variety of symbols that can be understood. And if you watch it again at different ages.The meaning will change depending on your age.\n\nIn the last,this animation reflects me to see many sides of human like a greed and else. Then finally of this movie they just want to show that it's hard to growing up. There are many obstacles we need to face with. But finally, we all pass through.",

The detail on the buildings, the liveliness of water, the deliciousness of food, everything is drawn(?) to perfection. \n\nBut to me, this movie was a bit hard to follow. Maybe it's because I kept dozing off for minutes at a time, but it's really just a confusing storyline. What, with spirits, animals, hatred for humans, etc. it's really different from any other movie I've ever seen.\n\nSpirited Away also has one of the greatest scores I've ever heard in my entire life\u2026 and I've seen over 600 films so that's saying something. This score is really moving and can definitely bring tears to yours eyes in seconds.\n\nHowever might I note that this film literally made me sad for a cartoon dragon\u2026 like\u2026 if that isn't good writing I don't know what is! Hayao Miyazaki is magnificent and I'm glad my first film by him got to be his most famous one! \n\nHonestly, what's not to love about Spirited Away? It has everything you could ever want from an animated film! No wonder it's rated so highly. Can't wait to watch this again sometime! Also yes, I did shed a few tears at the end of the film. 9.5/10 from me",

These universal themes are mixed with magic, monsters, myth and legend.  Don't turn away at this point - it could be like a lot of other cartoons but it isn't.  You grow to love and hate the extraordinary characters and the scenery is the most gorgeous I have ever seen in an animated feature.  You could put any still from the film on your wall and just sit and admire it.\nThe score is splendid too and the song over the closing credits (in Japanese) will make you weep; maybe that's because by the time you get to it, you will know you're in the presence of greatness.",

            "content": "I watched Spirited Away as a kid, when my then-weeb sister forced me to. We had to share our computer time and she forced me to sit there and watch this. I didn't like this film at all, and was constantly throwing a tantrum at every scene. First of all I had never liked anime, probably my sister had heard about this from school. And secondly I could have been playing browser games instead of watching this. But now when I look back at it, this is one of the best anime films I have watched. However, since I saw this film over twelve years ago, my knowledge is not very fresh and I might make some mistakes while writing this review.\nAs I have grown into becoming an artist now, the idea of this film has started to make sense. The film begins in an absolutely surreal manner. The idea behind the girl's parents turning into pigs after eating like them is quite scary, which is exactly what the film wants us to feel. I remember I was thinking why she doesn't sit and eat with them. I have always been such a foodie, I might have as well ended up like them if I were there. And then this girl had to run away and live among the monsters. Each one of them was traumatising, except the woman whom Spider-Eggman convinces by giving her a roasted lizard.\nNow I won't go too much in detail for the characters or the story, since I don't think I remember anything correctly. As I write this review I am getting occasional glimpse of some scenes, particularly the slime monster one. So all I'm gonna talk about are the other aspects of this film. First of all, this film is a dream for any postmodernist art lover. The idea of random things happening, the characters who can only exist in a fever dream interacting with the girl and the old woman - everything about this is like something Salvador Dali would be proud of.\nThe only problem I had in this film is from the plot holes. I could be wrong since I watched it so long back, that too while throwing a tantrum and not wanting to watch this film (I have completely forgotten the part where the black Shy Guy meets the girl; I believe it happens in this film?). The part where the girl tries cleaning the muck from the bath and the slime monster gets upset and start chasing her; how do they suddenly become friends? Just because the monster got tired from chasing her? That scene has never made any sense to me. Also who was that boy who came in the beginning? How come he never got to do the work the girl was doing, irrespective of whether he himself was a monster or a human? Either way it makes the film look like a nightmare, which I'm pretty sure it wasn't trying to.\nSen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi (this is the actual name of this film) is the first and by far the only Hayao Miyazaki film I have seen. Even though I don't know much about his signature style, this film gave me a vague idea of how he is different from the conventional anime artists. In case all his films are like this, I'd really hope to see them all. And I'd personally want to apologise for the bad time I gave my sister while watching it.",

Im an average middle class family man working a full time job and raising my children. Time is precious to me, I don't get much free time to sit down and watch a movie. I have been using rotten tomatoes for yeas now to help me pick good movies. I have built Tremendous faith in Rotten Tomatoes Audience score, if more than 4000 audience members have reviewed a movie and it has a rating of 70 or above its going to be a good movie worth watching. And if the audience gives a score in the 90's if going to be a Fantastic Movie!!!!  Until Now this movie STANK!  300,000+ audience reviewers with a score of 96% persuaded me to spend $16 bucks (renting wasn't an option through Amazon Prime) I literally feel like I got scammed on this one. This movie scored higher than Toy Story, WALL-E, and Moana, HOW this movie is garbage, I can't get my time or money back and this is the first time Rotten Tomatoes has let me down. How so many people loved this movie baffles me. I think I got scammed on this one.

I loved My Neighbor Totoro and it's one of my favorite animated films and I liked it because of a significant difference between the films. My Neighbor Totoro is rooted in real life and yet you see the world through the imaginative eyes of a child mixing reality and imagination. The few scenes that are actually fully based in imagination are incredibly powerful because of this and make your jaw drop. In Spirited Away there are no scenes of awe because the entire movie is based in a incredibly elaborate fantasy realm. This movie is like a mission impossible film with Tom Cruise running without stopping for 2 hours. It's cool at first but then you stop feeling as though something intense is going on as the whole film is intense. Overall, it's worth a watch as my opinion on the film is certainly unpopular.",

            "content": "A young girl's journey in search of bravery.\n\nHayao Miyazaki's family fantasy anime film Spirited Away (2001) is a coming of age masterpiece of hand drawn animation. Every scene like in Spirited Away is like a flowing river of paintings, lovingly hand drawn by Japan's Studio Ghibli. Miyazaki's direction is incomparable really as he juxtaposes frightening bath house chases with tranquil train rides over water for his spirit world adventure. \n\nMiyazaki must have overlooked this entire picture's production from start to end as everything is sublime from Ghibli's radiant lighting, vibrant color palette, fluid motion, and tender emotion in every frame of Spirited Away. Few films will ever measure up to the legacy Spirited Away has left as every anime film after it is compared to it. Spirited Away is animated perfection for all ages to marvel at forevermore.\n\nHayao Miyazaki's writing is phenomenal fun with affectionate empathy for the feelings of a little girl moving to a new town, only to lose her parents to a curse that transforms them into pigs. Miyazaki's story bears timeless themes about growing up and moving on from our past, so that we might look bravely towards the future with new eyes and a strong heart for change. \n\nMiyazaki's anime narrative is fascinating as he parallels a girl getting whisked off to the spirit world, forced into an evil witch's contract as a bath house maid for spirits with the scary feelings that come with moving. Her various encounters with spirits, witches, dragons, frogs, and pigs represent the many anxiety inducing scenarios we must face in life with a thorough uncertainty. I appreciate how Miyazaki's words shape Spirited Away's story into a triumph of courageously rising to challenges like meeting strangers, facing danger, acquiring work, befriending people, falling in love, finding yourself, and growing up. Spirited Away is a lovingly crafted anime for anyone to relate to Chihiro's emotional odyssey.\n\nTakeshi Seyama's editing is strikingly cut with hard cuts from action sequences to quiet passages of reflection that I really like. Seyama's steadfast editing has long held Miyazaki's pictures to nicely paced adventures and finely cut feature lengths. Spirited Away is a long 125 minutes that you'll never notice the run-time, because Seyama keeps it moving from strange new dilemma to new sequences quickly. Atsushi Okui's cinematography is perhaps his finest camera decisions with breathtaking wide shots of the water viewed from the spirit train. His mysterious shots for the nighttime at the bath house are riveting.\n\nNorobu Yoshida's production design is mesmerizing from the spirit tunnel that appears to be an old abandoned train station, the intricate bath house for spirits, the decaying carnival for souls, the peaceful spirit train to the serene woods, and the little car Chihiro's parents drive all have neat designs. Yoji Takeshige's art direction is beautiful with flowing water leading into large baths or a dragon flying through the air above water. Spirited Away is like feeling the air brush past your face with a cool breeze. Thomas Baker's effects are crazy for No Face's engorged belly and magical transformations from man into dragon with this glittering shimmer.\n\nJoe Hisaishi's transcendent piano driven score for Spirited Away is simply divine. You are captivated by every note and melody. Hisaishi's music captures the freedom and innocence of youthful wonder, first love, and a sense of adventure. He also finds a frightening eeriness for the scary sequences with a thundering roar of fear cascading over you with unsettling grace. I guarantee everyone seeing Spirited Away will immediately fall hopelessly in love with Joe Jisaishi's lovely score.\n\nI should mention that I adore the English Dub of Spirited Away. Daveigh Chase is wondrous as the brave girl Chihiro with her sympathetic voice and endless expressiveness. Jason Marsden is likable as the enigmatic Haku. His serious guidance is as involving as his quick expressions of adoration for Chihiro. He's just perfect as Haku. Suzanne Pleshette is excellent as the fearsome witch Yubaba as well as the kindly witch sister Zeniba. Suan Egan is amazing as Chihiro's fiercely independent and helpful friend Lin at Yubaba's bath house. Her lively personality and iconic voice always delights me to hear again.\n\nLauren Holly is nice as Chihiro's passive sounding mother, while Michael Chiklis is great as Chihiro's excitable father. David Ogden Stiers is really outstanding as the stern boiler room warlock Kamaji with a sweet softer side as he warms up to Chihiro as Sen. John Ratzenberger even cameos as the flippant foreman.\n\nIn the end, Spirited Away is a movie worth watching to cheer you up and let you appreciate life with a renewed vigor.",

Para nosotros como observadores externos la est\u00e9tica y comportamiento pueden parecer alienantes, sin embargo en ellos he encontrado palpables similitudes con el actuar de las personas. \n\nEntre lo delirante de los seres que habitan la temporal morada de Chihiro, emergen din\u00e1micas sociales, valores, ficciones, costumbres, antagonismos, como una sociedad encapsulada. As\u00ed pues de nuestras alucinaciones, nacen la justicia, las naciones, el sentido de la verdad, el bien, la identidad... como primates delirantes arrojados a un jard\u00edn esf\u00e9rico mayormente verde y azul.\n\nUna tristeza inicial que con el pasar de los a\u00f1os desemboca en los mejores casos en sabidur\u00eda, conforme nos aclimatamos al mundo que nos rodea, tal como sucede con Chihiro.

A\u00fan as\u00ed cada escena se siente llena de prop\u00f3sito y cuidadoso pensamiento, cada l\u00ednea de di\u00e1logo es significativo.\n\nCon su mundo fantasioso, surrealista, para algunos bizarro, El Viaje de Chihiro en m\u00ed ha proyectado una imagen sumamente realista de mi experiencia como ser humano, pues ha estimulado nociones tempranas, profundas y persistentes de mi consciente y subconsciente\n\nUna obra que ha tocado las fibras m\u00e1s entra\u00f1ables de mi ser.",

The parents made the dumb jass mistake of eating food where their was no one there serving or cooking and they themselves turned into pigs. The little girl knew something was up but the idiotic parents were like nope and they kept eating. So the actual movie begins by the little girl having to save the parents and work super hard for the mistakes of what their parents did. So throughout this entire movie I just felt bad for her because her parents put her through that. And guess what at the end of the movie SPOILERS the parents got all garbage with her saying hurry up and she should've been like excuse me i just saved you but nope. The parents knew nothing about turning into pigs and no big celebration or reuniting in a cheerful manner between the kid and parents. None of that. And I know what you're thinking. This isn't a Disney movie but technically on the US version it is dumbjass. Anyway this movie was good but that one key factor ruined it for me.

Each character was given so much personality, even the little soot spiders weren't treated as two-dimensional.\n\nIn a way the whole film felt like a dream, in that it is seamless. It flows, effortlessly, from scene to scene, from emotion to emotion - straight from terror and tragedy to comedy - without the subtle bump that wakes you up, that lets you know that the makers of the movie and the creator of the script had wanted you to be crying but now you really should be laughing. It was so LIFELIKE. Sometimes in real life the most grim moments contain honest elements of comedy that do not seem out-of-place. But trying to put that sort of convoluted emotion into a film creates a very thin line that too many have fallen off of.\n\nThere was no part of the film that felt fake, or rushed, or shaky; the intensity of the story line and the determination of the lead character was obvious throughout. More than causing interest, this movie made me FEEL. I was sucked into the drama. I can rarely say that a movie made me laugh and cry without feeling like an idiot, but the caliber of this picture is so high that I don't even feel embarrassed. I laughed. I cried.

The characters are fascinating and creative, the plot is engaging (simultaneously dangerous, whimsical, and enticing), and the animation is flat-out second to none. Contrast Spirited Away with the studio's follow-up film, The Cat Returns, and you might join me in wondering how the latter has anywhere near the same degree of critical acclaim, unless it's just spill-over that has lingered after the sublime move-going experience that is Spirited Away. Takahata's a genius, but Miyazaki is really the only director that can make deep Japanese folklore so enticing for an international audience (looking at you, Pom Poko). (5/5)",

A girl went to a place that is different from reality because people could use magic and there were a lot of unique living things. Her parents changed pigs by eating food from a different world. As she worked in a hot spring to save her parents, she met a boy and the boy helped her adapted this place. She grew up through extraordinary adventures. \nWhen I watched it, I loved this film and it was wonderful. First, I liked the expression to depict building, water, landscape, and people. I have watched other films by Hiyao Miyazaki a lot. They have different and individuality styles according to films. It was interesting to find different points and great for visuals. Moreover, I was satisfied with the fantasy point because I cannot do it. So, by watching this film, I wanted to experience and see the adventure and fantasy-like flying the sky.\nI think the music contributed to the big parts of \"spirited away\". Always music help people focus on the film. The music of spirited away is love steadily from people. Although people do not watch a film, they already know the music. I also listened to music before watched the film. When I listened to the music in the film, I was surprised. After the movie watched it, I can imagine the scene of the film and make me feel happy.\nIn the film, the direction did not just make this animation for children. He wanted to give special messages. He criticized the old culture of Japan in a hot spring. In the past, women had to serve men. Also, the film described the damage of the environment for people to dump trashes in the river. It is good to find implications in the scene. I recommend it to people.",

The parents made the dumb jass mistake of eating food where their was no one there serving or cooking and they themselves turned into pigs. The little girl knew something was up but the idiotic parents were like nope and they kept eating. So the actual movie begins by the little girl having to save the parents and work super hard for the mistakes of what their parents did. So throughout this entire movie I just felt bad for her because her parents put her through that. And guess what at the end of the movie SPOILERS the parents got all garbage with her saying hurry up and she should\u2019ve been like excuse me i just saved you but nope. The parents knew nothing about turning into pigs and no big celebration or reuniting in a cheerful manner between the kid and parents. None of that. And I know what you\u2019re thinking. This isn\u2019t a Disney movie but technically on the US version it is dumbjass. Anyway this movie was good but that one key factor ruined it for me.

The people involved in projects of this size are just incredible. They have great patience to make each painting by hand.\nThe story is very well written and the protagonist's journey is well developed and very noticeable from the ways that she demonstrates throughout the journey. The characters have charisma and are very original in their own constructions. The world in which the entire film is set is so rich in mythology that we ask several questions, but the film is under no obligation to answer them and this is very pleasant because it makes it full of possibilities.\nIt is a story with a beginning, middle and end, but with short pauses that make us breathe at the right time and make us reflect on the previous event. It's amazing how you identify with the character and that is because she is like us. And because of that fact, we grew up with it.\n(How nice to see Chihiro's growth.)",

Suddenly a boy called Haku  (Jason Christopher Marsden) takes Chirico to safety. The poor girl realizes that she is in a spirited world and she starts working in the hotel there. Chirico will do anything to get out but along the way she makes some friends. \n\nReview\nThis is an artistic anime and i think the spirits look very weird and creative. The director (Hayao Miyazaki) has made Chirico feel like our friend and we really get to know some of the characters. Because I am not a huge fan of anime movies this was hard to review however I can see why people would like it.",

Watch this movie. It has far exceeded my expectations despite the constant praise it has gotten, and deserves every award it was given and will go down as by far one of the best animation films in history.

To me, it's a great film with some of the most memorable characters in the studio's history, but it's not even close to other Ghibli films. Hayao Miyazaki is an expert creating wonderful, compelling characters, to the point where we forget that the story those characters received might make very little sense. Spirited Away is that movie that you watched when you were young and it changed your life, but everytime you rewatch it you wonder what was so great about it in the first place. ",

At some point, even Chihiro stops caring and abandons the search for a substantial amount of time in order to help a stranger. This made the film seem unbearably long.\n\nThe only reason why I don't feel like the movie was a complete waste of my time, is because it is very popular and it is good to have an opinion on popular movies.

She enters the spirit world of Japanese folklore, a world of gods, and spirits, where everything you think you know is wrong.\n\nIt ranks on several of the best films of the 21st century lists in the top five (and that placement is more than deserved). If you've never watched an anime, this would be my suggestion on where to start. If you enjoy it, you can move onto Princess Mononoke, My Neighbor Totoro, Akira, Howl's Moving Castle, Grave of the Fireflies (careful, this one can make even the toughest person shed a tear!), or a countless list of others that offer up something that traditional American animation doesn't.\n\nThe best thing about foreign animation is that you don't have to rely on reading subtitles; most have been dubbed in English (oftentimes being a seamless transition).",

The use of magic felt inconsistent, the parents were punished but never had to learn anything (because they were turned to pigs arbitrarily to advance the plot), and the climax of the movie of the girl looking through the pigs to see if her parents were in the group, was just a gut feeling, not choice that she made out of the knowledge that she obtained from the rest of the film, as would have happened in a decent movie.\n\nIf Spirited Away was released now with computer graphics, it would be mocked and dismissed as trash, because the only two decent characters in the film were the hungry garbage ghost, and the dragon kid. The whole thing needed a rewrite, and should have had much more of a \"Willy Wonka\" vibe in my opinion, with the child learning from the mistakes of the adults in her life or something.",

            "content": "- Your imagination will be Spirited Away by this epic fantasy -\n\nSpirited Away is bizarre. So unlike anything I'd seen when I first watched it, and I'm not particularly into Japanese anime. Little did I know its director, Hayao Miyazaki, would become such a world-changing part of my love for movies. Having watched it (so many times!), I can now say that Spirited Away is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen.\n\nIn this curious and lovely tale, Chihiro (Rumi Hiiragi; Ponyo, From Up on Poppy Hill), grumpy about moving to a new home and new school, apprehensively follows her parents into what appears to be an abandoned theme park. But once the sun sets, a hidden world comes to life and Chihiro realizes, to her horror, that her parents have fallen under a dreadful enchantment.\n\nIn order to earn her parents' freedom and escape the enchanted world she had stumbled into, she must befriend a charming crew of different creatures and serve in a bathhouse under the mysterious witch Yubaba (Mari Natsuki).\n\nSpirited Away is gorgeous, yet grotesque. You never know whether a scene will portray a glorious sunset over a bridge, or a gigantic river god vomiting the sludge of a thousand years' pollution. Somehow, the heart and skill of the Studio Ghibli team manage to balance the quaint and adorable with the dark, disturbing, and weighty. There is always something happening in each frame; I guarantee you can watch, re-watch, and keep re-watching because (like all Miyazaki movies) it is crammed full of surprises and delights.\n\nMiyazaki is one of the most important cinematic warriors for children and feminism today. Most of his animated tales feature brave young women, usually children, and they are masterfully complex. Miyazaki's women are neither damsels nor dominatrixes, and his children are portrayed just as children are in real life: learning, growing, tiny versions of real people. Nowhere is this more apparent than in Chihiro's story.\n\nI freaking love this unique coming-of-age tale about the power of love, trust, and kindness to overcome darkness, greed, and loneliness. It's full of dragons, ghosts, monsters, and the most adorable dust bunnies I've ever seen in my life.\n\nI was absolutely spirited away.\n \n----------\n\nEditor's note: While there is a solid English-language dubbed version of Spirited Away, this reviewer recommends the Japanese-language version with English subtitles to best capture the spirit of the strange and interesting characters. Certain voices and tones are quite different in the English version, which could make a big difference to a first-time viewer's experience!\n\n----------\n\nThis review was first published on Narrative Muse, http://www.narrativemuse.co/movies/spirited-away.

The plot is very thick, the animation is great, and the characters are very interesting.  One thing was a bit off.(SPOILER ALERT)  They don't explain a few things.  For example, a lot of the magic e.g.Chihiro being glued to the ground in the beginning or how she faded or how her parents turned to pigs or how if she held her breath on the bridge she couldn't be seen.  I also wondered about some of the characters' backstories, especially the boiler man's and Haku's.

This film has some odd concepts like parents turning into large pigs that overeat, or odd creatures, or not breathing while walking over the bridge.

            "content": "Spirited away is a wonderful movie, that is able to teach you and deliver many messages no matter how many times you watch it. It is about a girl named Chihiro, who is moving into a new house but her parents turn down the wrong road. She ends up losing her parents and traveling the spirit world alone with a boy named Haiku and a girl named Elizabeth to help her and look for her parents who have turned to pigs. The main point of spirit away is how good conquerors evil. Spirited Away is a extraordinary, movie because it is able to express different emotions throughout the movie, Although different scenes can be a little intimidating, the graphics are extraordinary and are able to capture a very detailed panoramic, with a beautiful artful balance between terror and joy, and each character if just filled with so much personality and not treated as a 2 dimensional object. However it can be breathtaking, it can also be so intense at times that your heart seems to stop and then rest go into a resting pace again.\nSome scenes in Spirited Away can be very intimidating at times, such as being a young girl who has to face a crowd of jangling, wildy variegated horde of frogmen, river-dragons, nameless ooze-beasts, radish giants, and above all, the witch Yubaba, A huge-headed, bejeweled monstrosity who steals names and memories. Chihiro (who is the young girl) has to face these horrifying monstrosities, which make her believe at first that she is dreaming, and has to eat spirit food so she does not have to disintegrate with the spirits yet. She is at a young age she, and really should not be the one to suffer from her parents doing, Luckily she is able to have friends that are willing to help her along the way. This captures such an amazing tale of how one little girl can go be strong and courageous just because she wants to save her parents. (Not only does she want them but she needs them.)\nThe graphics in Spirited Away are extraordinary, It really shows how Miyazaki (The producer) is able to portray wit and playfulness and charm mixed into the proceedings. The cool part about it, it is all hand drawn and then it is all digitised. \"Yet it has a dazzling quality, which has a fleetness and lightness in the way that switches from the close-up on a deft little sight gag or a sweet character observation, sweeping out for a breathtaking panorama of an extraterrestrial landscape imagined with  passionate detail and specificity. The whole film in a way felt as if it all was a dream and that is seamless. It flows without any effort  from scene to scene, from emotion to emotion straight from tragic to comedy.  This shows that it took a long time to actually create this masterpiece, before they digitize everything they have to hand drawn the characters and their amazingly detailed surroundings, which probably took them awhile to put so much detail into one paper and then making a movie out of it with perfect meaning and fantastic graphics, it is just mind boggling. This is why Spirited away is one of the most mass appealed and was one of the best animated movies that was able to win the top prize at the Berlin festival.\nThis Breathtaking movie puts so much personality into characters that even little things that you can treat as objects have a personality of its own. Spirited away is adjusted for all audiences especially american audiences. Spirited away's breath and heart, gave it the appeal that should touch all american viewers. This film is able to truly transport their viewers outside themselves-- or deep inside. But even the small soot balls in the film have a personality and are their own characters. Even though some things like soot balls you wouldn't think you could give them personality but Miyazaki (The producer) is able to think outside the box and give objects and things there own personality and make the movie a lot more Child-like and puts a little bit more character into each of his characters he comes up with which really brings this horrific movie together, without him this movie probably would not have been such a great success.\n    This film is so captivating, yes some parts of the film can be intimidating but this brave young girl is willing to risk everything to save her parents. The graphics are superb, each picture was hand drawn with a lot of detail and then digitized which is why it was considered the top winner of the Berlin festival. Each character was not treated as 2 dimensional, the characters all have their own little personality including the small soot balls that would carry the lumps of coal into the fire with their small little arms and legs. Spirited Away is such a wonderful and moving movie  in so many ways, each scene flows so seamlessly, without abrupt stops. There are times in the movie where you can cry and not feel like an idiot, because it is such a work of art that is able to pool a lot of meaning into this movie.",

I do wish that there was a bit more logic or explanation of how this spirit world works, because that was the part that I could not follow.   It\u0092s interesting how this film walks just on the edge of being too scary and strange for kids, but also feels like it is totally targeted at kids.  As an adult there were some elements that felt a little too childish in their execution, but I connected with the characters just fine.  This also might be the best dubbed voicework I\u0092ve ever heard on a Miyazaki movie (I\u0092m not a big fan of subtitles.)  The line delivery is much more natural, instead of feeling oddly rushed and stilted.  My only real complaint about Spirited Away is how odd the world was, to the point that it felt like there were no rules to how it all worked.  When a person can be randomly cut in half and then be fine two scenes later, I start to wonder if this world makes any sense at all.  Again, I respect the elaborate and unique world created in Spirited Away, I just prefer my fantasy worlds to still have some type of logic in them.  All that said, it\u0092s still my favorite Miyazaki film because I was genuinely invested in the story and definitely never bored.",

Miyazaki's use of spirits is always inspiring and wonderful. All these different creatures are so interesting to watch how they interact with each other. \n\nThose black fluff balls are so cute. Seeing the inner workings of the bath house is mind boggling. There's so much that seems to be going on. This movie is about a lot of things. But mainly it's about a girl who is becoming independent and mature.  \n \nThere's some really well thought out original ideas in this movie that are just really inspiring. I loved the whole metaphor of the big slime creature who came and got washed up. It turns out he was overly materialistic and greedy stocking up on all these things he didn't need and in the end after he got washed up, he left a clean spirited man, leaving all his gold and possessions behind. \n\nThat whole concept of the spirit train really hit me when I saw all these working class spirits getting off I guess to go home. And then I got to thinking, maybe in the afterlife, some people continue working and never go to paradise. It was a pretty haunting thought. Just like always, love trumps all can fix any situation. The mouse and the bird characters were so cute. And seeing the difference of how the two witch sisters live is a very important thing to note, because in the end it dictates there personalities. Hearing that the guy's voice of Haku is the same one who does voices in Skyrim, was great. I can't help but feel kind of worried for Chihiro, given that her life doesn't seem like it's the greatest since. Her parents don't seem to care too much. But knowing that she's still protected by the hair tie they gave her, is a nice touch and a great way to end the movie. \n\nOverall, amazing film. One of the most beautifully animated films ever to come out. Once again, Miyazaki and his team took me on another wonderful cinematic adventure filled with joy, humor, charm, and important lessons in life. This is a great movie about a girl beginning to blossom and get out of her shell and become a teen.",

This is so far overrated by the groupthink of critics that are afraid to step out of the box to go against the grain of their elitist community.  It is still a great movie.  However, it is nowhere near my expectation of a 10/10.\n\nThe film is well written, well produced and has some stunning visuals.  The animation is a little too \"choppy\" for my comfort.  The depth of the story and characters are very strong, definitely making this a great animated film.  The story is complex and pure fantasy.  This is not Disney fare.  However, the story became too complex for my taste.  The beauty of My Neighbour Totoro was the simplistic aesthetic of the story.  This plot has 2-3x more characters and plot twists that are largely left unexplained.   \n\nThe film is bizarre.  Much more so than My Neighbour Totoro, which was likely the most bizarre children's film I had ever seen.  This would never have been produced in America as it is so far off the historical, Hollywood box office formula for children's movies.   \n\nSpirited Away should be a benchmark for other animators to follow.  I believe it will hold its place in the history of animation for decades to come and could very well be an epic, if it is not one already.",

An enchanting mix of urban and legend. Top-notch animation, full of color that's not lacking in personality. Enticing conflict, high stakes, and three-dimensional antagonists. And, above all, absorption into a fictional world jammed with all sorts of monstrous characters having their own humanity. It all keeps you at this mesmerizing state of mind. It all feels familiar, distant, absurd, scary and magical, all at once, all the time.\n\nThere's few films I'd recommend as passionately and universally.

The animation is wonderful, the music is brilliant, but it is far more than just a children's film.  It has enough symbolism and deeper meaning to appeal to an older audience too.  One thing that did surprise me was how scary the film is.  Watching the film now was terrifying compared to when I watched it as a child.  Maybe you could argue that the main character Chihiro is quite annoying at first, but I think this is imperative to her character-arc.  She transforms from an irritant to a self-assured, confident young woman.\n\nRead my full review here: http://goo.gl/l7OECu",

            "content": "Beguiling and breathtakingly crafted, one of the best animation creators living today,  Japanese filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki has done it again by creating another master piece after his well-known film Princess Mononoke with his new animation Spirited Away. This animation Spirited Away conveys its audience to another realm and universe to edify us, on how to find our true selves. \nAs breath-taking as it is, this animation is often compared to an animation we all know, \"Alice in Wonderland\". This animation revolves around a sullen, whinny ten year old girl named Chihiro who wanders to a different realm of spirits, gods and mysterious creatures. Chihiro enters the realm when she flees after seeing her parents turn into pigs after they had devoured some spirit food they had randomly found in an abandoned town. As she runs away from all the bizarre events happening, she meets her first friend, Haku (a river god) who later helps her find a job at the Bath house. It is important to keep in mind that the bath house is the main setting for this animation, therefore it holds a lot of significances of how Chihiro finds her true self.\n Working in the bath house and having to lose her name \"Chihiro\" to Yubaba (the spirit owner of the bath house), Chihiro has to take on a new moniker of \"Sen\" and learn how to not be a jackanapes girl she used to be when her parents was there to spoil her. Being \"Sen\" Chihiro does not forget her real name, therefore she is not like Haku who does not remember his name, as a result of forgetting his name, he is under the control of Yubaba making himself who he really is not.  \nOne of the messages that Hayao Miyazaki wanted us to get out of the animation itself is never forget your identity, who you are or you will become someone who you aren't like Haku. Hayao Miyazaki also uses the Bath house as a symbol of the Japanese identity so that the Japanese people do not forget their history and who they are. Another Message that we get from this animation is greed. In this animation we see many forms of greed but Chihiro never showed any greed and at the end, she was better off than those who were greedy in the animation. \nI want to say that this is by far this is one of the best animations created. Why? The reason is how this film was made. Instead of using and relying on computers and technology to help draw the frames of the animation, Hayao Miyazaki draws each and every one of the thousand frames there is by hand. It is also amazing how the Japanese voice actors Miyu Irino (Haku), Rumi Hiiragi (Chihiro), Mari Natsuki (Yubaba and Zeniba) and Bunta Sugawara (Kamaji) can put the liveness into this animation. To record animations, it takes a lot of skills. Why? Because the cast has to be able to match the characters mouthing with their vocals to make it seem as if the characters are actually talking. In general, the Japanese cast does an amazing job by portraying their emotions and vocals into these characters therefore, this animation to me was one of the many animations that I found amusing and enchanting.  \nIn Most of his animations, Hayao Miyazaki focuses on the theme spirituality. As this animation Spirited Away progresses, we as the audience may get enchanted into this realm along with Chihiro and be able to find our true selves. Through Spirited Away Hayao Miyazaki provides his audience with a light that will help us guide our way to find our true selves through the dark. By finding our true selves, we can fully understand our true identity, and open the doors to self-acceptance.",

The characters are so interesting, it's troy is so creative. All of the spirits and ideas, aren't based off of any previous work, and the creativty is incredible. The political symbolism is very interesting, and sheds light on an important subject in Japan that I don't want to spoil. This film is amazing and can easily be compared to classics like Gone With the Wind, The Godfather, or even Casablanca. It's truly a film that you must experience in your life.",

That film was good, but this film was incredible.\n\nThe world that 10 year old Chihiro get's into is forcing me to go into it as well. One of the most creative films I have seen, with an incredible story and superb craftmanship.\nThe style is one thing, but Miyazaki is an amazing storyteller aswell. Mystical, engaging and not a flat moment. I believe that my attention was completely focused the entire playtime - there is no scenes I did not like. The monsters and creatures, the details, the fast pace, the story - I dig everything. I was left spellbound.\n\nReal life seem boring directly after watching it, this is a world that almost put's LOTR-stuff on a lower shelf. Heroes, bad guys, transformations and incredible creatures all participate - everyone of them got an original look or feature - the deapht of originality seem endless. Weird would be a wrong word to describe the film for me. It's certainly different - it really use the fantastic element of fantasy that animation can bring to it's fullest.\nThere are some hidden messages here, mostly clear for older audiences, but this must be one of the best kid-flicks ever made. I'm actually really glad it's hitting cinemas in Norway in just a couple of weeks with Norwegian dubbing. Every pupil of primary school should be given the opertunity too see this.\n\nLong avaited films for me, or films that I've kept on hold for a long time often disappoint, but this one delivered and turned out to be one of my top favorites.\n\n9.5 out of 10 adventures.",

The visual language has a lower tonal intensity than most recent Disney or Pixar productions, but it is effective in telling the story with a measured pace and meaningfulness.  \n\nThis story reminds me of Narnia, with the wardrobe as the portal in and out of another world.  However, the theology is quite different. This is solidly based on an animism tendency, perhaps with various shades of Shinto.  There is no transcending God.  Instead, there is the humanistic empathy and compassion as the emotional atmosphere, while the Duty and Love as the twin cores of the value.  \n\nThe most remarkable aspect is the value of \"work\" - here is the menial slavery of cleaning floors and bath tubs - as the savior of one's own spirit and others.  Our heroine's work did not have much value nor glory, yet she was transformed by the hard-work. \n\nThere are some similarity of negative values such as the gluttony and greed, and a gentle goading to the overweening maternal instinct. \n\nThis is a very good movie for children and adults!",

And there are a lot of unique Characters and some points to enjoy this movie. This movie was filmed in 2001 and won many prizes like Japan Academy Award as Best Song, Berlin International Film Festival as Golden Bear and it won Academy Awards in Best Animated Feature in 2003. This movie was showed in several countries other than Japan and America. Second, there are a lot of unique characters in this movie and these characters implied the feature of human today, so I recommend you to watch this movie with these knowledge. For example, No-Face is human's desire itself. So, No-Face took a lot of money and approached Chihiro. If Chihiro succumbed to the temptation, she would be swallowed by No-Face. Another example is Chihiro's mother. She has really cold personality even to her child. It reflected the typical mother today. It means they both work and have a strong self-reliance and demand it to their children. Third, this movie is really deep. It has a lot of interesting scene that you probably don't notice. Haku said that if you forget your real name, you couldn't go back to real world. When Chihiro went to Yubaba's office, she wrote her name on a paper, but she took a small mistake unconsciously. It mean she started to forget her name. Animated movies have a lack impact? That's not! This movie is really clear and significant. Finally, this movie is really interesting, deep and also include great animated views and expressions, so I like this movie and I think you'll like it!",

The movie would make you think about life a few hours after watching it.  This movie is VERY symbolic about the meaning of life and the hero's journey of conquering yourself and your own fears. Although modern day Disney movies also do this; frozen, they just seem to fall short with the power and volume of the message.  Anyways, I don't think this movie deserves a fricken 97%  but I'd give this movie a 90+%",

This setting - unmistakably Japanese - provides endless amounts of nourishment as a massive showpiece of imagination, attention to detail, fancy, delight and cultural lore. There's more going on in the backdrops of Spirited Away's throwaway scenes than many of its contemporaries can manage to plaster up-front and center. It's a bit less focused than Princess Mononoke, which preceded it in the Miyazaki timeline, but that's because it's such a decidedly different, strange creature altogether. Here we're taking the time to embrace and celebrate the inherent weirdness of Studio Ghibli's world, where I could happily sniff daisies and people-watch for the rest of my days. The primary storyline is steadfastly unpredictable, twisting and writhing like a wild beast caught on a leash, but is able to, with time, pluck most every last plot thread and leave us all with a deep sense of satisfaction. Ambitious, fiery, awe-inspiring and diverse, it's worth repeated viewings amidst audiences of all ages.",

Many have rejoiced it as the shining example of the perfect Japanese animation. I sadly couldn't embrace the beauty that many seem to find in it. As of now, I have seen the film 4 times, and with each viewing I seem to gain a much better insight on its appeal, but it is still far from the general acclaim.\n\nSpirited Away features an easy to follow story of a girl who ends up working for a spiritual bath house in order to save her parents, who have transformed into pigs. The events that happen throughout the film are certainly inventive, blowing away the imaginations that many animators or directors try to bring to life in animations. My primary issue with the film is its complexity in its themes. It is only during my previous viewing that I gained some sort of understanding on what Miyazaki was trying to explore. Spirited Away discusses the importance of hard work, that in order to get what we want, it must be earned. The film also explores the concept of identity and how when under the contract of your employer, one loses it. This was something that I felt, was true to life and also original in terms of cinematic themes. If only the film makes these easier to grasp, I wouldn't have too much of a problem with this film. The film is driven by these themes, rather than its superficial story, and if a film is going to take this route then it should make the road easier to drive on. The film also featured a couple of moments that dragged the pacing but fortunately it wasn't abundant enough to be labelled as a major issue.\n\nThough most of what I have just said has been negative, the film does have its merits. The film is a visual delight with scene after scene of jaw dropping beautiful shots that rivals the best from Studio Ghibli. Another positive element was its musical score, with every couple of minutes had me in a state of merriment or grief; precisely hitting the emotional impact of its characters. The voice acting in this film was strong, I have seen Spirited Away in both Japanese and English and each one being remarkable.\n\nI had hoped that maybe this time my opinion would drastically improve, but that was not the case. I highly doubt this time that my opinion would improve any higher, given that I have already seen this 4 times, but I definitely will not stop coming back to this film as its staggering visuals and blissfully beautiful score blew me away with each viewing.",

I will use one word to describe it - wonderful! \r\n\r\nIt tells the story of Chihiro Ogino (Hiiragi), a ten-year-old girl who, while moving to a new neighbourhood, enters the spirit world. Stumbling on the food street in that world, her parents are transformed into pigs by the spell of the witch Yubaba (Natsuki), and Chihiro takes a job working in Yubaba's bathhouse to find a way to free herself and her parents and return to the human world.\r\n\r\nMiyazaki's script was based on associate producer Seiji Okuda's ten-year-old daughter, who came to visit his house each summer. Production of the animated film began in year 2000 with a budget of US$19 million, but during production, Miyazaki realized the film would be over three hours long and decided to cut out several parts of the story. I wish I could see the rest of the story! English version of the film was supervised by the Pixar director John Lasseter, a fan of Miyazaki. Screenwriters Cindy Davis Hewitt and Donald H. Hewitt wrote the English-language dialogue, which they wrote to match the characters' original Japanese-language lip movements. I haven't seen that version, I enjoyed the original with subtitles.\r\n\r\nJust to say that this is the most successful film in Japanese history, grossing about $270-350 million worldwide. The film even overtook Titanic (at the time the top grossing film worldwide) in the Japanese box office to become the highest-grossing film in Japanese history with a \u00a530.4 billion total. Critics just love it, as the audience, and this animated movie is considered one of the best films of the 2000s decade and one of the greatest animated films of all time winning the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards, the Golden Bear at the 2002 Berlin International Film Festival (tied with Bloody Sunday) and is among the top ten in the BFI list of the 50 films you should see by the age of 14. But , even if you are over 14, better now than never!\r\n\r\nIf you want an amazing out-of-this-world story, excellent animation where technology is kept at a level to enhance the story, not to \"steal the show\", perfect voice acting, meticulous editing, outstanding music... and many more things... please, spend over 2 hours watching this masterpiece!",

            "content": "Watching Spirited Away feels like opening a special gift. It is a film of such startling imagination, originality, intelligence, and emotion that I feel inexplicable joy. This movie starts with a young girl named Chihiro, who's really bummed out about moving to a new city where she won't be able to be with her old friends. Her mother and father are ready to move into their new home However, a wrong turn on the road leads them to a mysterious, abandoned theme park. Or so they think. It turns out that the family has stumbled upon a passage to the spirit world, with Chihiro's parents transformed into livestock after unknowingly consuming the food of the spirits without permission. Frightened and utterly alone, the only way for Chihiro to survive in this strange new world is to toil and work herself raw in a bathhouse run by a wicked sorceress.\nThe animation is so fluid and organic, the character design so colourful and twisted\nIt emphasizes on the beauty of traditionally drawn animations which in our times right now are being replaced by computer generated ones that lacks the colors, emotions, and depth of every line, texture, and detail that traditional drawing offers. The film is deeply dreamlike in places, particularly the scenes which take place in or around water and which are complimented. Miyazaki is not only good at dealing with light, but his darker tones are extraordinary too, from the thick sludge spewed forth by No-Face to the fire that spews from Yubaba's mouth. \n\"Once you have met someone you never really forget them. It just takes a while for your memories to return\". This is a famous quote from this movie. Every time when I think of this sentence, it remids me of the story filled with characters and moments that capture the essence of adventure.",

Intended for a 10 year old female audience, this proved to be the ideal target market for Miyazaki to play with, because while it remains 'safe for children', it does not shy away from the darkness, as our loveable Chihiro races through the strange (often terrifying) bathhouse of spirits, trying to break the pig curse placed on her parents and find her way back home. And don't forget the characters! A giant baby! Bouncing heads! Paper men armies! Adorable dust bunnies! Witches with faces the size of your body! That thing in the elevator! And literally hundreds more! But nothing can beat the disturbing No-Face, a complex lonely spirit who adapts the personalities of whoever he consumes, arguably the greatest character invention of all time. Which is why Spirited Away will always be remembered as Ghibli's most defining, essential piece, and not only because it's the most successful film in Japanese history or the studio's first Oscar winner, but because it's a modern day classic comparable to Alice in Wonderland, allowing the viewer to go as deep as they want to regardless of age. And that's simply perfect. \n\nTo read the rest of my 'Worst to Best: Studio Ghibli' list, click here: http://juicenothing.blogspot.co.uk/2014/06/worst-to-best-studio-ghibli.html",

            "content": "Really enjoyed this one. Released in 2001 Spirited Away is the story of a young girl names Chihiro (Daveigh Chase from Lilo & Stitch). Chihiro and her family come across an abandoned amusement park where her mother and father eat foods intended for spirits turning them into pigs. Chihiro is befriended by a friendly spirit named Haku (Jason Marsden) who shows her how to survive by working in a bathhouse made for the spirits. The animation is simply amazing in this one. Although, the story does get a bit bizarre at times its a sweet story about a little girl learning about life and growing up. It also has a nice little romance subplot about love conquering all thats sweet to watch. Overall, I really really enjoyed this one and find it now as one of my top three Studio Ghibli films! It's a strange, but worthwhile ride!",

This proves that Miyazaki's imagery is unforgettable. Seeing it now I could appreciate the beauty and the depth of the story, of course, therefore I'm glad I waited this long to watch it again. I simply love how Miyazaki acts as an authoritarian. He forces us into his world, we are completely subject to his artistic and creative choices, and he sends the message that either we believe whatever goes in his mind or we waste the opportunity of identifying with a beautiful creation. Spirited Away is that: a unique depiction of Miyazaki's most deranged corners in his creative intellect blended with a clear critique to the shallowness and ambition of the new world.",

So what if this is simply a tale of a girl named Chihiro who grows up in the spirit world through acts of selflessness? I accept archetypes. I am here to indulge in the undeniable beauty of the film's animation, and Miyazaki's imagination failed to disappoint. Don't misread what I say about the story as the movie being thoughtless, for how Miyazaki portrays characters is strongly connected with how these characters perform or develop. Humans turn into pigs for eating the spirits' food, while the gold-greedy spirits who work in the bathhouse resemble frogs. There are the spirits in the market square outside of the house that look near identical -- black, ghostly, faceless. The spirits on the train aren't much different, except they are dressed like travelers from an early film noir. One of these spirits, No-Face, wears a white mask to appear distinguished, and grows fond of the loving Chihiro (who loses her name in the bathhouse and becomes Sen). There are the two witches, Zeniba and Yubaba, that represent good and evil, respectively. Yubaba runs the bathhouse, with the assistance of her spirit slave Haku, whose forms include human and white, bird-legged Chinese dragon. The foreman of the house utilizes his infinite number of arms to direct water flow in each bath. He is also in charge of an army of ash mites that throw coal in a furnace to heat the water. I'm too sick to organize this information in any way. It was a joy to watch this.",

            "content": "The winner of the 2001 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and arguably the most critically acclaimed film to be produced by Studio Ghibli, Spirited Away was only the second of Hayao Miyazaki's films I had seen after witnessing The Wind Rises.\n\nWhen I walked away from Spirited Away, I walked outside the cinema into a world where everything seemed colourful and beautiful to me. I had my spirits lifted greatly by watching the film and experiencing the magical dark mystery of it, and I earned a new appreciation for the power of animated cinema and the skills of Hayao Miyazaki as a film director. \nSpirited Away is admirable for a lot of reasons, and it was the film that went to show me the endeavour of strength than anime cinema could have on a viewer. It did take me a little while to get into the swing of things because at first I found that the dark fantasy theme of the film was a little creepy. As I got sunk into the film more and more this feeling gradually faded away from me though I still knew it was there, but at the same time as having a certain sense of childish fear as a response to the darkness in the story, I also found it to be one of the film's greatest traits. Spirited Away respects its viewers enough not to degrade the darkness of its material down to a childish format. And while some viewers will find the dark nature of Spirited Away to be creepy, those who will appreciate the magical sense of mystery in it will truly enjoy the film.\nI wasn't expecting Spirited Away to have the kind of impact on me that it did, but I was more than very pleased with the film. Its interpretation of the spirit world is excellent because it leaves audiences on edge about how to truly feel about it. While as a whole it depicts the spirit world as a dark place where black magic dominates with strength and leaves the people around to suffer under the tyrannical rule of the monetary focused with Yubaba. There is always a certain tension in Spirited Away due to its unpredictable and dark nature, so when the plot dynamics face a more optimistic light it is a feeling that viewers should truly treasure while they can. The mood is constantly intense in Spirited Away, and when it turns more positive for protagonist Chihiro, audiences are likely to feel the same thing. For an animated film, Spirited Away easily manages to have viewers empathising with its main character by having them feel the exact same thing as her, albeit from a third person perspective, so the feeling the viewer gets from watching Spirited Away is magnificent.\nSpirited Away is unforgettable because of the complicated way that it depicts the spirit world. There is no way to tell what is going to come around the corner in Spirited Away because it could be literally anything. In a world where humans are turned into animals and forced to work under the rule of Yubaba, audiences are likely to end up raising a lot of questions which cannot physically be answered due to the mystery of the spirit world. The way it depicts the universe for better or for worse is just incredible. No live action film has ever depicted the spirit universe as well as Spirited Away did, and the fact that Hayao Miyazki took on the challenge with Studio Ghibli is excellent because they tackle the visual aspects of Spirited Away and its subject matter head on with honesty and ambition, and without fail they succeed in creating surreal and mysterious entertainment which is also thought provoking. It raises a lot of questions and brings out a lot of mythological elements such as dragons, ghosts and magic, and it touches upon them in the manner they are written to be without turning them into commercialised chilidish characters, so Spirited Away is a film I would recommend to children who are ready to take a step closer to the darker strengths of storytelling.\nDespite a budget of a mere $19 million, Spirited Away features the some of the greatest quality anime that I have ever seen. The movements of the characters is very organic, and the entire universe of the film is very colourful. It captures a lot of detail for the scenery and the characters with the best animation available from Studio Ghilbi, and as well as maintaining the consistent quality of detail and colour, it makes use of some moments of top-notch three dimensional animation which is very visually pleasing. Playing of the two dimensional style of the standard Anime style, Hayao Miyazaki manages to use its two dimensional characters against the backdrop of many three dimensional effects and scenery in certain scenes which makes the strength of the animation in Spirited Away all the more effective. The immense colour in Spirited Away is exceptional and very vibrant, lighting up the screen and captivating the viewers.\nAnd the dedication of the voice cast makes the entire experience more powerful, and it fuses with a strong musical score to ensure that Spirited Away is appealing from both a visual and auditory perspective. The musical score in Spirited Away made the entire experience more atmospheric as it kept the feeling up on the magnificent scale that the story had reached for while also enhancing the mysterious and intense nature of the story. The musical score maintains the same mystery as the film during its darker moments and optimism while it plays out its uplifting scenes, so it is constantly in tune with the mood of the story well.\n\nSo Spirited Away is definitely the greatest anime film I have ever seen because with Hayao Miyazaki's ambition and the hard work of Studio Ghibli, the film creates a lot of unforgettable imagery which makes the surreal tale of dark fantasy excellently animated and unforgettable for the magical effect it has on viewers.",

Each of the characters are fully realized and all have their own flair, from Chihiro to Noface to Yo Baba to the giant baby. All of the aspects of the film are good, but two are astonishing. One is the visual masterpiece put together, that includes everything the bright exuberant color palate to the effective use of camera making some really cool shots. The second was borderline oppressive in how much there was of it, and that's originality. Miyazaki weaves together such a never before conceived, wholly original world it was almost distracting from the story. This all being said, Spirited away is one of the best animation movies, and changed the way I see Miyazaki, 4.5/5",

The beautifully animated feature is nothing short of a masterpiece and is close to perfect than 99% of movies I've ever seen. If you haven't seen it, then I recommend you stop everything you're doing and watch it. If you have and didn't like it. *sigh*. After watching it after probably five years, I can't truly say this is a top five or even as high as top three best movie ever.\n\n This movie is the definition of what movies should be. It has everything a person should ask for in a movie and much more. If you can get past the fact it's animation and that the theme is foreign, you'll will enjoy a movie that not only will live you stunned but will could captivate you. This movie is made by of the best animated directors of all time and a director that has never made a bad move. He's one of the only directors I've seen where he's never made a rotten movie. If there was such thing as a Hayos version of a Nolanite...I'll be the defintion of one. Spirited away is his bread and butter. It brings together everything special about this director. I don't know how much I can say besides, everything in the movie is almost perfect. \nSide notes\nThis movie isn't only the best of Hayo's historic franchise, its the best animated movie I've ever seen. If you love animation, then there's no way you'll not love this. It has everything I wanted in an animated movie. Its funny at parts, inspiriing, and has some bleak action. The movie overall is an A to me and will go down in history as \"Top five best movie ever\". 9.8/10",

Spirited Away's visual style is magnificent, truly a triumph to behold. The films story takes the familiar, Alice in Wonderland, idea and totally turns it on its head by creatively telling the story with more dramatic twists, heightening the film to masterpiece quality.

            "content": "A movie called \"Spirited Away\" has been watched many people in the world. This is my favorite movie created by Hayao Miyazaki, who is one of the most respectable Japanese directors in the world.\r\n\r\nThe heroine of the story is a girl who is 10 years old, called Chihiro. The story moves with the process of her maturity. In the movie, there're meetings with various kinds of people and creatures that are recognized as \"Japanese Gods\" or those who were created by Miyazaki originally. Through life in strange world, Chihiro learns a lot of things which are needed to be an adult. This point is one of big themes of the movie. Miyazaki implies that people cannot avoid facing the independence from parents and entering to a society where they have not belonged when becoming an adult. Also, we can find a message that is related to destruction of nature. Because actually this movie has quite a lot of themes, and the more we watch it, the more we can find new aspects of messages from Miyazaki.\r\n\r\nI mentioned the story above, and now I will say something about the artistic side. Ordinarily, movies created by Studio Ghibli are composed of tremendous numbers of layers. This is a traditional way to make an animation. Actually \"Spirited away\" is no exception and it is important point to make movies more better. In all cases of Ghibli, hand-drawing is used in the creative process. By this, creaters who have professional drawing skills can express their sensitive feelings into a layer. Then, as a result of gathering professional works, the great movies such as \"Spirited away\" are born and have fascinated people's hearts. Furthermore, these movies are closely-linked to its music. In many cases Ghibli music is created by Jo Hisaishi, the world-famous music composer. He has a preeminent sense of expression and he can express Japanese emotions exquisitely. ''Spirited away'' can be said it is a remarkable example to show perfect harmony between image and music.\r\n\r\n After watching this movie, I felt a sense of nostalgia and a curiosity that I had felt in my childhood. So this movie has not only messages suggested by Miyazaki, but also a mysteriousness of Japan. It has still charmed people even if they are not Japanese. you will think about some things like the experience at a river near your house, or a mysterious world next to you after you watched the movie. Then at that moment, you may be \"spirited away\".",

In trying to free her parents from the spell that casts them into living, breathing livestock, and in trying to keep herself out of danger, she must brave the being known as No-Face, Yubaba's giant baby, and Yubaba's twin sister, Zeniba. The animation matches the quality of Miyazaki's previous work and contains a much more entrancing story that \"Howl's Moving Castle\". Miyazaki has a way with developing large amounts of characters in all his films, which makes them so entertaining to watch. He creates these fantasy worlds that are fully formed, with their own laws and rules, and then brings these worlds to life through the stories that are told in them, often filled with heroes and adventures, an unsuspected damsel in distress and evil ugly witches that can be conquered through friendship rather than destruction. \"Spirited Away\" is my favorite Miyazaki film yet, with \"Howl's Moving Castle\" being the only other film of his that I've seen, but already I enjoy the story-telling much more than I anticipated and even though I have zero affinity for anime, these films transcend that styling and create a genre of Japanese animation all its own.",

They succeed in making Sin feel very believable and lifelike in her actions as a teen girl.\n\nThe world Spirited Away presents is weird, and even after sitting through the whole movie, more questions will remain a mystery than answered. Although this can be seen as a deficiency, I see it as a pro. The world is so magically beautiful and unknown that, having answered no questions, it will stick in your head a long time after watching - keeping you wondering.\n\nThe story doesn't amount as much to the magnificence of this movie as the animations and fantastical world do, and is a mere classical child narrative. The protagonist heroine gets in trouble because of a mistake, is brought into a prickly situation by an evil character, but the resilience of the good-natured heroine - and some good-natured helpers - win out over evil. The story is not bad, considering Spirited Away has a child audience, and even add enough nuance in its characters to make them more interesting than black-and-white stereotypes.\n\nThe use of the theme of love and it's effect on the story is clich\u00e9 here and will not surprise anyone in any way, but is not mellow and its subtle enough to be enjoyed by an older audience.\n\nSpirited Away is a top-notch movie for children and can equally be enjoyed by an older audience. It successfully connects with a dual audience and should be applauded for that.",

            "content": "Let's say that you take a wrong turn into a tunnel that lands you into an abandoned town. Not to mention, your parents are turned into pigs. What would you do? Arguably one of Hayao Miyazaki's greatest movies, Spirited Away, tells the story of how a 10 year old girl goes on a quest to save her parents inside a mystical land many know as the spirit world. Despite being a Disney movie, Studio Ghibli worked hard to deviate from that restricting title and created a name all for itself.\n\nHaving seen a lot of Miyazaki's work, I can safely say that this is one of the best movies that he has ever created. I grew up watching Studio Ghibli films and have recently branched off into a lot more anime. While this movie was created early in his career as a film maker, it really sets the quality of his work at a high standard. It was his third well-known movie, after \"Princess Mononoke\" and \"My Neighbor Totoro\". After these successes, people started paying attention to his other films and realizing that they could find more of these magical worlds.\n\nIn the story, Chihiro, a little girl that just lost her parents to the spirit world, must fight to gain them back. She meets a friendly boy named Haku who helps her get a job at the place where the evil witch, Yubaba, keeps her workers and trespassers of the spirit world captive. She is the one that originally cursed her parents and the only person that can break the spell. However, this is no ordinary bathhouse. By day, it appears to be an abandoned building, but by night, it turns into a prestigious spa that is used by strange creatures from Japanese legends. No matter how friendly the face, Chihiro is terrified and cautious of them all.\n\nMiyazaki does an amazing job of making his characters grow and mature, while making them strange enough but still well developed to create a magical world. Chihiro starts out as a bratty little kid who is too scared of facing anything in the real world, but when she is faced with life or death situations, she grows as a person and becomes more confident in herself. She discovers a new side of herself that allows her to gain courage and save her loved ones. Miyazaki creates hundreds of fantasy creatures, each serving a purpose in helping Chihiro grow, no matter how obscure. They are all given a place in this world he has created which helps shape this mystical land.\n\nHe also creates a fun story for all ages to enjoy. In no other movie will you find a bathhouse inside of a spirit world with a witch that steals your name to keep you prisoner and turns your parents into pigs. Neither will you find a river spirit that has forgotten his name, and can shift between a boy and a dragon. It is astounding how strange everything is, but how much sense it makes. It doesn't live by the classic Disney name, instead veering away from princesses, fairy tales, and \"true love\", but stories of growth and struggle.\n\nLastly, the film score in the movie was phenomenal. It was composed by Joe Hisaishi, a renowned artist that has written music for many of Miyazaki's films. He was the student of Takeo Watanabe, a legendary composer, and seems to have followed in his footsteps of greatness. All of the music for this movie, except for the last song, was played by the New Japan Philharmonic, a very prestigious ensemble. The pieces vary from soft and serene to action packed and lively. It showcases Hisaishi's work and brings together the entire movie. \n\nAll in all, Miyazaki's movie is one for the ages that everyone should watch. The movie as a terrific plot with creative characters. The score is very imaginative and delightful to listen to, whether accompanied by the movie or not. \"Spirited Away\" teaches us lessons of finding ourselves, stepping out of our comfort zones, and helping those in need. It is a very inspiring movie and a work of art, one of the best I have ever seen.",

            "content": "I don't hate anime! Seriously, I don't. And yet, the reputation this movie has suggests that anyone who doesn't hate anime will certainly love Spirited Away. Well that surely isn't the case. Many start their reviews of Spirited Away by saying how this was their first anime. This is not my first anime exposure, but it is my first Studio Ghibli, Hayao Miyazaki experience. And I was not pleased. \r\n\r\nI have found a great source of entertainment in anime TV shows. The street racing show, Initial D, is a wonderfully constructed human drama, with plenty of cars! It's not fair/possible to compare Spirited Away to the reality-based Initial D. Secondly would be the mind-blowingly great Cowboy Bebop. Don't be fooled by the name, the show is possibly the deepest piece of television I have ever seen. On the surface, Cowboy Bebop might just seem like a simple Sci-Fi/Western/Noir show, but it's so much more. Intellectually, Bebop puts Spirited Away to shame.\r\n\r\nSo what to take from these first two paragraphs? While this is my first Hayao Miyazaki movie, this certainly isn't my first introduction to anime. And I can say with confidence that I have seen much better in my very limited experience. \r\n\r\nThe story centers around a young girl named Chihiro. On the day her family is moving into a new house (which means no friends and a scary new school for her); the family happens upon an abandoned theme park. Chihiro is apprehensive about exploring this park, but her parents insist. They wander the deserted stalls, until they come to one filled with delicious food. Her parents start gobbling it up ... like pigs. But Chihiro is still nervous; she walks away from her parents and runs into a boy named Haku. Haku warns Chihiro to get out of the park, before it's too late. But it already is too late. On returning to her parents, Chihiro finds them transformed into literal pigs! She is then thrown into an insane world, where she must find a way to transform her parents back, and get out of the nightmare.\r\n\r\nSpirited Away appears to be the natural place for novices to start when it comes to Hayao Miyazaki. I was no exception. In some ways, I was very impressed. It takes an incredibly active imagination to come up with this world the movie lives in. So while I would call the movie a clear success in representing Miyazaki's imaginative filmmaking, I would also call it a jarringly poor example of storytelling. The movie is well over 2 hours long, and there really isn't enough story to support 90 minutes. The entire scene with the \"stink spirit\" is largely pointless and drawn out. The entire sup-plot with No-Face goes nowhere, and takes up a lot of screen time. There just isn't enough plot to merit a movie of this length. I honestly don't know why this movie is so well loved. It's just one random scene after another. Sure the world is interesting to behold, but that's about all the movie has to offer.\r\n\r\nAnd yet it seems that anyone who doesn't like this movie has to wring their hands and fret over why they don't love \"the great Miyazaki's magnum opus.\" Well I'm sorry to say it, but \"the great Miyazaki\" doesn't have a very good or very deep story on his hands with this one. The ending of the movie doesn't really explain enough, and leaves a few questions unanswered. Like why does everybody hate humans? What kind of creature is Lin, because she sure looks like a human to me? If Haku is a spirit, why does he take on the visage of a human boy? How does Chihiro even know that none of the pigs are her parents at the end? There are plot conveniences galore, thanks to the fact that the movie exists in a fantasy world. There are no ground rules, so anything goes. Whatever the plot requires can be conjured out of thin air. How convenient. These, along with a host of other questions, really grinded my gears. \r\n\r\nBut let's be honest, if this movie wasn't so highly regarded, and if it wasn't made by the god-like Miyazaki, then none of these problems would even be an issue. But then again, if this movie wasn't so highly regarded, and if it wasn't made by the god-like Miyazaki, then I would have never watched it. \r\n\r\nThe movie's calling card is its visuals. And those don't disappoint. I give Miyazaki all the credit in the world for dreaming up this universe. And then to translate that dream into a reality on screen is highly commendable. Visually, it's a piece of art. Though not exactly a piece of art I would actively seek out.\r\n\r\nSo yes, Spirited Away can be celebrated for its incredible world and inventive visuals. But it cannot be applauded for a quality story or great symbolism. Maybe I don't appreciate this movie as much because I just finished watching the afore mentioned anime series, Cowboy Bebop, less than a week ago. Honestly, Bebop is a piece of art that makes Spirited Away look like something created by a scared and confused child. Spirited Away doesn't do much dramatically. It doesn't have great symbolism (or maybe it had such deep symbolism, that it went right over my head), and it doesn't say anything about life on nearly the same level as Cowboy Bebop. Maybe it's not fair to compare the two ... then again, Spirited Away is considered one of the pinnacles of anime, so I don't think any comparison is off limits. Bebop is what really got me fascinated in anime, and it's one of the main reasons why I watched Spirited Away. Both are considered masterpieces within the genre, so I was expecting a lot out of Miyazaki's film. \r\n\r\nThere isn't a whole lot to say about the vocal performances. All of them are perfectly acceptable. The girl who voices Chihiro in the English dub is a bit annoying at times, but overall there aren't any complaints regarding the performances.\r\n\r\nThe musical score by Joe Hisaishi is perfectly pleasant stuff, even if it does begin to blend into the woodwork in the middle portion of the movie. The opening title scene is very well scored with a beautiful piano theme. The only other time the score sticks out is in the scene where Haku and Chihiro are flying through the sky near the end of the movie. That was a show stopping piece of music that I will definitely seek out.\r\n\r\nIf this review comes off as me hating on the movie ... then I guess I got my point across. I'm sorry, but I didn't like this film. I actively disliked it. It just seems like one of those movies that you aren't allowed to hate, simply because everyone else loves it. In fact, for 20 minutes after I finished the movie, I tried to rationalize reasons to love this movie. I eventually gave up. I can see why some would like this movie ... even love it. But it certainly isn't for me. I'll give Miyazaki another shot with Princess Mononoke and Howl's Moving Castle. But I'll go into both of those movies with tempered expectations. Maybe I'm wrong about him, and I hope I am. Then again, if Spirited Away is the best Miyazaki has to offer...\r\n\r\n\"Once you've met someone you never really forget them.\" 4/10",

The film opens with ten-year-old Chihiro riding along during a family outing as her father races through remote country roads. When they come upon a blocked tunnel, her parents decide to have a look around -- even though Chihiro finds the place very creepy. When they pass through the tunnel, they discover an abandoned amusement park. As Chihiro's bad vibes continue, her parents discover an empty eatery that smells of fresh food. After her mother and father help themselves to some tasty purloined morsels, they turn into giant pigs. Chihiro understandably freaks out and flees. She learns that this very weird place, where all sorts of bizarre gods and monsters reside, is a holiday resort for the supernatural after their exhausting tour of duty in the human world. Soon after befriending a boy named Haku, Chihiro learns the rules of the land: one, she must work , as laziness of any kind is not tolerated; and two, she must take on the new moniker of Sen. If she forgets her real name, Haku tells her, then she will never be permitted to leave.\nMy Review\nIf this is the only film that master animator director Hayo Miyazaki directed and written that got an oscar man this Ghibli fan is piss. For quite a while now i have been watching many Ghibli films because i was on the search for good anime not so violent and without nudity anime's. But now i know i have not only found great anime films but great films in general and deserve great recognition and praise. I believe that everyone should watch a Ghibli film,for they are great films with small(and sometimes intense violence) but on most occasions are just beautifully crafted and complex kid's films that deserve Oscar's. This is Spirited Away. Spirited Away is a wonderous Fantasy that revolves around a young girl,Chhiiro,trapped in the spiriit world. When her parents undergo a mysterious transformation(into pigs) she must call upon the courage she never knew she had to free herself and her mother and father to the human world. This film is without a doubt inspired by Alice in wonderland but is a little different in way's i like and enjoy the movie for. This film is filled with astonishing animation and epic adventure,it is a dazzling masterpiece that must not be forgotten. I give the spirit world in Spirited Away a 5 out of 5.",

            "content": "(****)  First some back story.  I've been trying to see this movie for years, but unfortunately I live in a college town.  Why does that matter?  Well, in Athens we have a great local chain of rental stores called Vision Video.  They are still thriving in the Netflix era because they have such a massive selection and are located in a town full of educated and, admittedly, hipster young folks.  This store is the source of most of my film-watching.  Every time I go, I browse through several movies I've been wanting to see and maybe some new releases, but I always make a point to see if Spirited Away is checked out.  For the last four years I've never seen it available, until a few days ago.  I finally got this DVD in my hands and went straight home to watch it, hoping my expectations weren't too high from all this waiting.  My friends, they weren't.\r\n\r\nSpirited Away is the best piece of animation I've seen in a very long time.  After the first viewing, it has already made its way into my top five or so of all time.  That's saying something when you consider that favorite cartoons is probably the oldest list I ever came up with.  The Lion King still rests comfortably at the top, but this one is now in the ranks.  My first exposure to Miyazaki put me in a place I haven't been in since childhood, a fantasy world where things look strange and unfamiliar, and the rules don't necessarily make sense.  The level of creativity in this movie has been lost from American animation for a while.  We tend to just put an anthropomorphized animal into a conventional story line where all the characters and scenery are fairly recognizable.  The art of high fantasy has lately been restricted to novels or comics, with movies giving way to slapstick adventures of some brightly colored CGI character traveling through a brightly colored world trying to accomplish some goal which is secondary to the visuals and laughs.  The funny part?  This movie's visuals make CGI look like child's play.\r\n\r\nMiyazaki is sort of a traditionalist in many ways, including his embrace of traditional Japanese culture.  HIs main accomplishment in this area is showing the power of hand-drawn animation.  There are some digital aspects to this film, but they are only used for certain effects, with the vast majority being drawn.  We need more of this today, because right now CGI just hasn't been able to reach the level of detail and intricacy that a real cartoon can.  I don't know enough about either to say why, but it's obvious in the results.  Cartoons can still make people look like people, rather than weird caricatured guys with giant heads and small bodies or the like.  Miyazaki adds another level of detail and realism which beats out most of the recent Disney animation.  One of my favorite scenes was when Chihiro was putting on a shoe and kind of struggled a little bit getting it over her heel.  I was happy to see this mentioned in the special features also, because it stuck out to me as an awesome attention to detail.\r\n\r\nRight, so, plot.  The main character, a 10 year old girl named Chihiro, follows her parents through a suspicious tunnel and ends up in a spirit world.  She soon finds out that she is trapped, and has a long road and a lot of hard work between her and getting home again.  She becomes a cleaning lady at a bath house for the spirits (sort of a spa situation) and slowly transforms as a character from a whiny baby to a mature and determined heroine.  She works under the dictatorial owner of the house, Yubaba, who is sort of a wicked witch character with a soft side for her baby.  She also makes friends with a boy named Haku, but is never quite sure if she can trust him.  The movie unfolds in many unexpected directions as she continually tries to find some way to get back home while also treating those around her in a just and loving fashion.\r\n\r\nThe wise and touching values expressed in this movie absolutely floored me.  Hard work, independence, and care for your neighbors, friends, and even strangers are the primary themes.  I feel like this movie is much more responsible than most of what children in America are being taught today, sort of a \"be an annoying brat and do whatever you want to\" mentality that has spread through family comedies recently.  Spirited Away teaches about being willing to work for your goals, never giving up, but taking the time to stop and do the right thing on the way.  I could almost see Miyazaki and my grandfather sitting on the front porch discussing how people used to be in the good old days, when everyone worked hard and everyone loved one another.\r\n\r\nAnyway this has stopped being a review and turned into a love-fest.  If you get a chance to see this film, please do.  It will restore your faith in animation and in humanity.  Also, it will make you feel like a kid again, and that's the best high in the world.",

Read the film info for a proper story explanation but basically a girl enters a spiritual world and has to rescue her parents who have been turned into pigs. Sound interesting? Or does it sound freaky, weird, random and trippy? With all the top ratings it received, I figured it deserved a try. It gets full points for imagination and the soothing soundtrack compliments this fantasy world beautifully. However, it's bloody difficult to get into when all this random shizzle is going on. Children may have a good time since they can enjoy the animation and the wacky events this film throws at you, having less interest in deeper plot details. I had my own ideas about what this girl's adventure represented, which turned out to be wrong, but I thought it would have offered a satisfactory explanation (acknowledging the fact that what I predicted had already been done in 'Bridge to Terabithia'). Thanks to Wikipedia, you can research all the themes and running metaphors after which did a little to increase my appreciation of it. \n\nThere is a shock factor from all the magical creatures and environment so the less you know beforehand, the happier you're going to be going into it. The data doesn't lie, 97% on rotten tomatoes suggests that my opinion is the odd-one-out but I believe most people I know personally would feel the same way.

Spirited Away is the most beautiful, heartwarming and imaginitive anime movie I have ever seen. Miyazaki is a mastermind like no other and created in my opinion a pure masterpiece of art. \n\nThe animation is out of this world. The colors flourish, the backgrounds burst out creativity and detail, the movement and expressions these people make are as realistic and genuine as I could have ever hoped for. The animation is spot on perfect. Spirited Away has an incredible personality all the way through in every single pixel. I have never seen anything like it. Only Hayao Miyazaki himselfe can create this kind of  fantastical imagery.\n \nThis movie has some of the finest and most memorable characters in any animated movie ever. The characters are beautifully written and to say they are likable is an understatement. I love these characters they are amazing! They all develope through the story and find their place where they belong. Chihiro learns the importance of trust, judgement, courage and kindness. She meets some of the most pure, caring and original characters I have seen in any movie to date. She forms frienships that nobody can break and it gives me tears to no end. \n\nI have to say I am a sentimental person and I have grown more sentimental as time goes by. Spirited Away just made me realise how kind and helpful people can really be. That under the hard skin there is a beautiful and breathtaking core. Never judge a person because they all have something special inside them. I cried and cried like a little baby and I`m not afraid to admit it. This film had such an emotional impact on me that I never anticipated. You just care for these characters so incredibly much. \n\nYou can really relate to these characters and Chihiro reminds me of myselfe in many ways. I think that is what really hit my heart. The tale itselfe is wonderful and spectacular in every sense of the word. \n\nToy Story was my favourite animated movie ever but I am positive that Spirited Away just beat it. I love this movie simply love it. This is the best animated movie ever made and I would go as far to say that it`s in my top 10 favourite movies of all time. \n\nThe masterfully crafted movie that captured all of our hearts. Thank you Hayao Miyazaki for giving us arguably one of the best movies ever made.",

            "content": "Having co-founded Studio Ghibli in 1985 and directed 11 films himself, the highly unique animator Hayao Miyazaki has announced his retirement. The forthcoming \"The Wind Rises\" will be his last venture, so it now seems like a good time to look back at arguably his best film.\n Chihiro is a 10 year old girl who is moving to a new neighbourhood when her father decides to take a short cut and gets the family lost in an abandoned theme park. Helping themselves to food that's on display, Chihiro's parents are transformed into pigs and it soon becomes clear that they have stumbled into an alternate reality. Chihiro is then forced to find a way to free herself and her parents and find a way back to the human world.\n Quite simply, Miyazaki's \"Spirited Away\" is a triumphant, fantastical, masterclass. Not only is his hand drawn animation as gorgeously refined and refreshing as ever, but his storytelling incorporates everything from the mythical to the magical, taking us on a truly breathtaking visual and intelligent journey. As his later film \"Ponyo\" would channel the likes of Hans Christian Andersen's \"The Little Mermaid\", here, Miyazaki has undoubtedly crafted his version of Lewis Carroll's \"Alice In Wonderland\" and it's in this similar realm of imagination that he is able to flourish. We are introduced to a myriad of fantastical figures from Gods, Spirits and Witches to a Sea Dragon, an enormous baby and strange little coal miners, known as \"Sootballs\". Despite the rich hand drawn animation, though, it's not all played for fun. It's a rights-of-passage tale about the progression of a child to adulthood while finding the time to comment on the economic downturn of Japan and the increasing loss of it's culture to the western world. It's this very complexity that makes this Miyazaki's near masterpiece. The only issue with the film is that it's overlong, resulting in periodic disengagement - especially for younger viewers. It's runs just over the two hour mark and this is with several parts of the story cut out- the original version of Miyazaki's story would have run over the three hour mark. That being said, this is still one of animation's true classics and thoroughly deserving of it's Academy Award for Best Animated Feature in 2002.\n A breathtaking tour de force from one of the finest and most imaginative storytellers that animation has ever seen. Sadly, there will be only one more outing from Miyazaki but thankfully we've had to the pleasure to enter into his creative genius at all. Such accomplished cinematic experiences will be sadly missed.\n\nMark Walker",

            "content": "After My Neighbors the Yamadas, Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki were working on this huge project, and not only did this project become the highest grossing movie in all of Japan, it was so good, that it won Academy Award for Best Animated Feature in America, earning $200 million dollars worldwide, and earning the title Picture of the Year for the2002 Japanese Academy Prize. It has become the film to rival all films in Japanese animation history, and since then has become one of the greatest pieces of work ever made in its original form. And without this film, it is likely to believe, that no one would ever hear of Hayao Miyazaki or Studio Ghibli or where these films were coming from if it weren't for this movie. \n\nThis film has far exceeded my expectations in every category regarding animation, that it is by far my all-time favorite animated movie, and at least one of the top 10 all-time personal favorite films on my list. It is none other than both Studio Ghibli's and Hayao Miyazaki's grandest poetic masterpiece and best adaptation of a coming-of-age story, Spirited Away.\n\nWHERE, DO I EVEN, BEGIN?\n\nThe plot starts with Chihiro and her parents moving into a new town and in a new home. While trying to get to their new house, they end up getting lost and coming across what seems to be an old abandoned theme park, until Chihiro is forcefully separated from her parents, while ghostly-like spirits start appearing out of nowhere, as a boy named Haku tells her that she is in the spirit world and that he can help her out of the spirit world as long as she obeys and does what the sorceress Yubaba tells her to do, and it's basically a story where Chihiro needs to be strong in order to rescue her parents and get back to the human world.\n\nI can already tell you that I'm literally jealous of this film to the point of despising it, a sort of, \"so good, it has to be bad\", compliment, one of the highest compliments I could possibly more or less give a film. \nI'm jealous of its likable characters, I'm jealous of its original story, I'm jealous of its unbelievable animation and visuals, the music, the colors, everything in this movie is just PERFECT, FLAWLESS, INCREDIBLE AND PHENOMANAL. One of things especially the music, is one of my favorite musical scores that Joe Hisaishi has ever composed. \n\nThe main thing I focus with this film is that it is nothing but imagination, creativity and above all else, originality, and I love every single second of it from start to the end credits, whether in English or Japanese, though personally I do like some things in English than I do the Japanese version, but that's beside the point, Miyazaki has done a phenomenal job bringing one of the best works ever to film history that it has become a groundbreaking point for people everywhere who has seen it. There are no problems, no interruptions, no annoying characters, it is a simply a beautiful masterpiece. It's fun, its creative, the kids will enjoy it, adults will enjoy it. I've gone on and on about it long enough, check it and decide for yourself.",

Characters in this world include, an evil witch, the witches abnormally large baby, a man who has more than his fair share of arms, and a monster who can't talk unless he eats someone.

I felt lucky to see this Miyazaki masterpiece with a charming story, wonderful animation and unforgettable characters. I loved every moment of Spirited Away that I felt that I could make a movie inspired by this film. The soundtrack in Spirited Away is unbelievable. The main theme starts out with a piano and then is taken over by the Japanese orchestra that right away gets me into a mood of watching the rest of the movie. Spirited Away not a typical animated musical comedy with funny sidekick characters to make the audience laugh with annoying jokes or a moment when the main character singing about his/ her feelings, But more like its own movie with its own story set in a Japanese bath house in the spirit world. When ever I tell someone  like my parents about Spirited Away, they tend to ignore the film or despise it. I don't understand why? Do they prefer CGI films instead with a used story or they only watch movies that are only made in America. Then a thought came in my head about why Miyazaki release this film in Japan. since Spirited Away was a huge hit in Japan, Miyazaki wanted the whole world to know about this film so they could learn more about the Japanese culture while watching this magnificent film. I think that's why Spirited Away is such a glorious film because it's educational to watch not just about the story or animation, but more one the world and culture that Miyazaki made towards the audience. Spirited Away is what I call a masterpiece in cinema because it's trying something different than the rest of the other usual American successful film. Spirited Away is a MUST see film for everyone of all ages.",

His movies are never short of magical.\n\nThe story is about a little girl named Chihiro who is moving to a new area with her parents. They get lost and take a side road. Eventually they end up at an abandoned theme park. Chihiro parents at this point decide to explore it and it brings out the kids in them. Soon the two of them come across a fantastic smell. A smell so good it makes them starving. Her parents follow said smell. In a local pavilion there is a heaping of food. Together they eat and eat and eat some even enticing Chihiro to have a bite, though she never does.\n\nOnce her parents finish eating they turn into pigs. Dirty, stinky and fat. Chihiro soon meets a man who says he is able to help her parents and turn them back to humans. As the story goes on Chihiro comes to face with a magical world. Things are not what they seem and her quest to save her parents becomes an adventure.\n\nThis movie really has an Alice in Wonderland feel to it and that is what makes this movie so great! The animation is stunning and the story quickly draws you in. While not technically a straight Disney movie, it should be considered as one the best in decades. Great movie for kids and adults. Miyazaki adds certain details that only adults would understand which makes the movie so much better. It had heart, action, love and teaches a lesson.\n\nI give this movie a 9.5/10 Run do not walk and rent/buy this movie you will enjoy it. Definitely on my list for top animated movies of time!",

However... Spirited Away engrossed me from the beginning, and I know that if it was based on a literary counterpart written in the finest way imaginable, one could STILL not imagine how beautifully exquisite and perfect this story is. From the initial mystery regarding Chihiro's surroundings, to her struggle to navigate through the new and mystical world she finds herself in in  order to save her parents, and then, almost forgetting her main task in order to selflessly help Haku, with even Yubaba feeling regretful for having to test Chihiro in the end - Every aspect of this story is compelling and enchanting. Every emotion experienced by each character is masterfully imposed onto the viewer, but not forcefully, just naturally. \n\nA masterstroke of modern cinema.\n\nSimply beautiful.",

It's from the highly acclaimed Miyazaki, but I must say I'm missing the hype. The animation is beautiful, and has many techniques I've never seen before. The pure atmospheric beauty of this film makes up most of my rating. I later encountered a set of stills from this, and it's like a two hour painting. So I will fully credit Spirited Away in its animation. The earliest flaw I noticed was the dialogue, the copy I had was the dubbed version, but the dialogue in it wasn't even on par with a Dreamworks movie. Those at least have social satire for the older crowds, here it was about on the level of a Disney channel cartoon. The screenplay felt set up purely for a kids crowd, which is why it shocks me how many adults have personally connected with this. The story is about a ten year old girl who stumbles into a world of creatures, and gets a job in a bathhouse for them. Some parts of what happened next felt like Miyazaki just BS'd as he went along. Went way to far into fantasy, and decided it can pull off any crap it made up. I strongly felt this when Haku learns his real name, which was a scene that frustrated me. While the story was not creative, the characters were. Miyazaki did have some lively ideas in the sense of character creation. The end of the line though is that I felt this was much more for kids, and while I can appreciate it, I believe it's over rated on a global scale.\n\n3 stars--",

There is a lot of symbolism and background to the characters. There are many things that Westerners need to know about the Japanese culture to understand it, such as, the Japanese believe everything has a spirit and even the name \"Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi\" (Literally, The Mysterious Disappearance of Sen and Chihiro) starts with the word \"sento\" (bathhouse) and Kamikakushi has the symbol for spirit in it, so it's an insight into a different culture that most Westerns never see.",

            "content": "A Coming of Age Story for all Ages\nA Review by Calvin Joseph Kranig\nAt a time when 3D animation ruled the big screen with such films as Monster Inc. and Shrek, Spirited Away came as a shining beacon of why 2D animated were still relevant.   With Spirited Away Hayao Miyazaki(Director and Writer) and Studio Ghibli have created a masterpiece by which all future anime films will be measured against. It is a visual treat and an excellent example of 2D hand drawn animation at its finest. Hayao Miyazaki creates a breathtakingly imaginative new world that only helps immerse the viewer into the plot of the film. The story is a classic coming of age story, and invokes memories of Alice in Wonderland. It is a terrific film for the whole family to enjoy, and is an excellent introduction into the anime genre. \nThe movie begins with a ten year old girl, Chihiro(voiced by Daveigh Chase), and her mother(Lauren Holly) and father(Michael Chiklis) driving to their new home. Along the way the father  decides to take a short cut on a dilapidated old path which leads the family to an old abandoned theme park and they begin to roam through the streets while Chihiro begs for them to go back. Chihiro's constant whining at the beginning of the story can become quite annoying, and for some, this might ruin the movie right from the start.\nIt is there for a very good reason however in that it sets up Chihiro's character as that of any ten year old girl. If she was perfect from the start there would be nothing to build upon; there would be no way for her character to grow. Chihiro's whining to return to the car might be annoying but it turns out to be good advice as Chihiro's parents find a food stand and begin to quickly devour the food that mysteriously is still there. Chihiro walks away towards a bath house and runs into a boy by the name of Haku(Jason Marsden) who yells at her to return across a stream that she and her family had crossed to get to the theme park. As Chihiro runs back she runs into her parents who are now... Giant Pigs! Chihiro whines in terror(once again), and runs back to the stream to find its been turned into an ocean. The movie really start to pick up here as a boat comes across full of spirits. Chihiro runs back through the park, and finds that it is also full of spirits.\nShe runs into Haku who begins to help her get her bearings in this new fantastical world. He helps her get a job at the bathhouse from the evil witch Yubaba(Suzanne Pleshette) , but it comes at the cost of her name which she is forced to change to Sen. It is this beggining to the movie that begins to draw comparisons to Alice in Wonderland.\nIt is in essence the same story. A little girl is dropped into a strange world full of strange creatures and must find a way to get out. However, this is where the comparison ends, because unlike Alice in Wonderland, Spirited Away has an actual storyline and is not just a collection of wacky scenes. In Spirited Away the main protagonist develops into a new character as the story progresses, and faces the constant conflict of having to savee her parents throughout the movie. This gives the story direction which is something that is not present in Alice in Wonderland, and therefore makes Spirited Away the superior film. The beggining of the two movies might be similar, but the the rest of Spirited Away couldn't be more different than Alice in Wonderland.   \nThe beginning Spirited Away quickly segways into the middle part of the film which consists of a bunch of character developing scenes that showcase the good, non-whining, side of Chihiro as she toils away in the bathhouse.. These all lead up to the big finale where Chihiro is forced to save her parents. \nAlong the way Chihiro's character grows into a perfect role model for any ten year old girl. She showcases her altruism, and goes from being a self centered whining little girl to being a caring individual. It is a beautiful story that ranks up there with the best coming of age stories out there. \nThe movie also succeeds in hurdling a major trap that most Japanese animated films fall into, and that is the disastrous occurrence of a poor japanese to english dub. The characters mouths match what they are saying a majority of the time, and there are few instances where you sit there wondering if your watching a Godzilla movie. The great dubbing of the film into english does not add much to the film, but it more importantly does not detract from it either. \nSpirited Away is an instant classic, and everyone should watch it at least once in their lifetime. It showcases a beautiful coming of age story that teaches children the benefits of altruism. It has memorable characters and scenes, and above all, it is a perfect example of the beauty of 2D animation.",

Spirited Away utilizes the greatest asset the medium has to offer in the art direction; it's not trying to look like reality, it's letting us explore a new world so much unlike our own.\n\nThe images on screen, rich with symbols and metaphors tell the audience so much about this place without a word. Miyazaki's directing makes the protagonist feel like an extension of the viewer, the point of view camera angles emphasizes the urgency Chihiro feels in this new frightening environment and the dark tones in the beginning really lead to a genuine feeling of being alone and scared while remaining highly intrigued.\n\nEvery scene interjects yet another level of mysticism, just as more answers are revealed more questions follow. The balance that Miyazaki walks is so perfectly crafted, you can rest assured from the introduction to the film that you are in for a well-paced ride.\n\nThe consistency of the characters throughout allows your own perspective to change; the landmark achievement of this film is taking your interpretation of a frightening and serious world into a warm and inviting home. The writing is so brilliantly masked by the \"Pixar\" like charm; that questions about your own identity will still linger far after the closing credits.\n\nOn top of that each character has a fulfilling arc to add, and the honest emotional ties formed with these animated characters are such a propitious surprise. Sounds and animation was the bulk of communication for the first thirty minutes and it created such a personalized tone open for interpretation for any viewer.\n\n\n\nHowever, the mystery and intrigue of the world unfortunately met a climax far before the actual plot did. Around the hour and fifteen minute mark the film lost a great deal of surprises; I liked the world but it was nowhere near as compelling.\n\nThis could be overlooked but the actual conclusion to the plot which was absolutely terrible! For all the intelligent symbols and extended metaphor in the rising action to cop out at the end with a deus ex machina ending of true love between two ten year olds being the catalyst to save everyone brings such a clash of shallow writing to the otherwise insightful and meditative first two thirds of the script.\n\nWith that being said, Spirited Away is a sincere achievement in animation. Using the advantages of the medium, thought provoking writing, and awe-inspiring art direction; Spirited Away is a timeless film that shouldn't be over looked.\n\nWritten by Zach Morrissey",

Sometimes, you're having a dream in where you were chased by strange monsters in strange places and the only way for you to get rid of it was to wake up.

The beautifully animated feature is nothing short of a masterpiece and is close to perfect than 99% of movies I've ever seen. If you haven't seen it, then I recommend you stop everything you're doing and watch it. If you have and didn't like it. *sigh*. After watching it after probably five years, I can't truly say this is a top five or even as high as top three best movie ever.\n\n This movie is the definition of what movies should be. It has everything a person should ask for in a movie and much more. If you can get past the fact it's animation and that the theme is foreign, you'll will enjoy a movie that not only will live you stunned but will could captivate you. This movie is made by of the best animated directors of all time and a director that has never made a bad move. He's one of the only directors I've seen where he's never made a rotten movie. If there was such thing as a Hayos version of a Nolanite...I'll be the defintion of one. Spirited away is his bread and butter. It brings together everything special about this director. I don't know how much I can say besides, everything in the movie is almost perfect. \nSide notes\nThis movie isn't only the best of Hayo's historic franchise, its the best animated movie I've ever seen. If you love animation, then there's no way you'll not love this. It has everything I wanted in an animated movie. Its funny at parts, inspiriing, and has some bleak action. The movie overall is an A to me and will go down in history as \"Top five best movie ever\". 9.8/10",

Chihiro finds herself lost in the spirit world after her parents are transformed into pigs by a malevolent witch, and she must gather her strength and courage if she hopes to save them! SPIRITED AWAY transports us to a fantasy world that is filled with strange and magnificent creatures who are brought to life through Miyazaki's captivating animated style. Chihiro's journey is a timeless story of self-discovery and the coming of age, where a young girl first discovers love and compassion by acting outside herself. Miyazaki uses traditional storytelling techniques to paint a unique new fairy tale that children of all ages can relate to, while keeping with its Japanese origins. The sometimes horrifying creatures that Chihiro encounters each represent a stage of childhood that she must overcome, and bring with them valuable lessons that she will use in her budding adolescence. SPIRITED AWAY provides childlike wonder for kids and adults alike, and is a masterpiece of modern animation. \n\n-Carl Manes\nI Like Horror Movies",

Therefore I try to give films an honest rating, there are only a few of my favorite movies that are 10/10 movies, those being, for example, the lord of the rings films, the green mile, and a few others, Spirited Away is one of them as well. I think I was maybe 10 or 11 years old when Spirited Away popped up on cartoon network, I caught maybe the second half of it but I was enthralled so (get this, so old fashioned) I grabbed the newspaper and looked through the TV schedule to find the next viewing. I ended up watching it every time it was on TV until they stopped showing after like two weeks, my dad thought it was unhealthy for me and encouraged me to go outside anyway. I ended up forgetting about the movie for a long time, and I mean a long time. As a grew up I kinda picked up bird watching as a hobby and am actually now turning it into a profession, but I remember doing some research on barn owls and watching a video where the top rated comment was \"barn owls always remind me of no-face from spirited away\" holy crap, I've heard of that movie, yeah, it was that one on TV years ago, gosh I need to watch that again. I got my hands on the movie and as I sat down to watch it, for the first time in like 9 years, I thought to myself, \"hmmmm... I hope this movie still appeals to me now that I'm almost 20\" two hours later, there's me wiping tears from my eyes, grabbing my computer and looking up every other ghibli film out there. It was like I was immediately addicted, I needed my fix of ghibli films so I, eventually, over a year or so, got my hands on all of them; honesty, most of them are quite fantastic as well, especially mononoke and totoro. But back to this movie; as someone who watched dragon ball z and digimon and pokemon and anime like that and eventually grew out of it, I was completely astounded at how 'real' this film felt. No, obviously, the things that happened in the film took place in a fantasy world that was expertly crafted and just stretched the imagination beyond belief, but the characters felt real, they were tangible and believable, I connected with them and I cared about them because their emotions were earnest and connected with me so vividly. The character development was fantastic and that was one of the things that made it such a joy to watch. And some people might say that the story is haphazard and confusing; I didn't think so, I think the things that were unexplained in the films or ambiguous were meant to be that way, it adds to the mystery of it, and that's another that I loved so much; being able to make those decisions for yourself as to what you believe the writers implied. Not only that, but the animation itself was absolutely fantastic! The most visually breathtaking drawings and scenes I've ever seen are from this movie. And, as a musician and student of music, I'd like to say that Joe Hisaishi absolutely perfected this film with his impeccable score! Since I first re-watched it almost a year ago, I've probably watched it 5 or 6 times since and I just cant get enough of it. I listen to the soundtrack all the time and it's just beyond beautiful, as I mentioned before. This film is an absolute treasure, many people write off animated films before they give them a chance, but this is a film that could easily be translated into a live action film with real actors and it would work just as well; the medium with which a film is presented doesn't always dictate the quality or style of the film. I never thought that an anime film would be one of my favorite films of all time but indeed it is, I will watch Spirited Away a hundred more times, and when I have kids, I'll make sure it's one of the first films they watch as well.",

In SPIRITED AWAY humans are secondary to an imaginative world of creepy supernatural beings shaped in the bizarre forms of  monsters of all sorts.  Chirhiro, the spunky little heroine, and only human, at the centre of SPIRITED AWAY must confront these strange lifeforms, otherworldly spirits, in order to save her parents who have both turned into giant pigs.  Will she manage?  Two hours of supernatural Japanese artwork reveals both the lessons learned and consequences that  are the result of walking through unknown, perhaps even forbidden land, in Japan's eerie take on Alice In Wonderland.
