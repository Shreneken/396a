Tolkien's iconic novels.\n\nThe film picks up where the previous two films left off, with Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continuing their journey to destroy the One Ring, while Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) lead the armies of men, elves, and dwarves into battle against the forces of Sauron.\n\nThe Return of the King is a true epic, with breathtaking battle scenes, stunning visuals, and an emotionally charged storyline that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. The film is also a fitting conclusion to the trilogy, bringing together all the threads from the previous films and delivering a satisfying payoff to the audience.\n\nThe film was praised for its technical achievements, including its visual effects, cinematography, and sound design, and was awarded 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Song.\n\nOverall, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is a masterful and breathtaking conclusion to one of the greatest cinematic trilogies of all time. Whether you're a fan of the novels or not, this film is a must-watch for anyone who loves epic, action-packed, and emotionally charged cinema.",

I'm so sick of it. Also, the lands are too emtpy, the distances are too short and Eowyn's bellicose posturing is not criticized. Still, it's a great movie.\n\nTip: watch the EXTENDED EDITION. It's much better than the standard one.",

            "content": "A Classic Epic Fantasy Film and a Excellent Conclusion to The Beloved Trilogy. The acting is phenomenal across the board along with an amazing music score just like its predecessors. The cinematography is very well done in this. The only problems I would say is that there is ALOT more green screen and CGI in this one compared to the other 2 that had a lot more practical effects and on location scenes and it looks out of place compared to the other 2. There is a couple scenes in this as well that are oversaturated with CGI and the scene with Legolas taking the elephant down is stupid (And the only time I would say that about a scene in this trilogy). The editing is very well done in this though just a tad below the other 2 which also goes hand in hand with really the only dent being this films pacing is not as good as the other 2. It's still good pacing but the 6 minute opening with Smeagle's backstory and the 15 minutes after Aragon is crowned King feel like they are slow and don't really contribute anything to the main journey and aren't needed and make things drag at the start and end a bit. The other issue is while the scenes with Froto, Sam & Smeagle are good in their own right they go own awhile and we've already seen this in Two Towers so it feels like even though its needed for plot we've already seen it and king of makes things drag a bit. Though the amazing battle scenes more than make up for it. If that was the only issue and not the other 21 minutes than it wouldn't really be a problem. Overall this is a somewhat bloated Classic Fantasy Epic that everyone will enjoy to an all time classic trilogy.",

Throughout the years, I have seen all the cartoons, listened to the books on tape, played with the lead figures in the 1970s as an early teen, etc. Back in early and mid 1970's, there wasn't a ton of LOR imagery and art. It was mostly in your head. This was before the Dungeons and Dragons explosion. Peter Jackson did an excellent version of these books. The characters look just like you imagined as a child reading the books. The introduction of the female elf character, in my opinion, even enhanced the stories and was well acted. I wished Jackson had carried all this quality into The Hobbit series that he made a little too much like a fantasy video game that was all over the place in parts.

The script is incredibly well written and the slick dialogue is performed masterfully. From \"I am no man\" to \"For Frodo!\" to \"My lady!\" and many more, there are chill-inducing moments due to smart writing.\n\nWhile it is emotionally draining to complete the trilogy, it is equally fulfilling. There is a lot packed into these 10 hours of film (non-extended editions). Though long and complicated, Return of the King wraps up the best trilogy ever made with elegance.\n\nBest Character: Samwise Gamgee (Top 5 most selfless character in all of cinema)\nBest Moment: The \"My friends, you bow to no one\" scene\nBest Quote: \"I can't carry it for you, but I can carry you!\" - Sam",

It is funny, thrilling, sincere, thought provoking, sad and ultimately relatable.\n\nThe good vs bad story has been told over and again in cinema, but yet from the J R R Tolkien epic Peter Jackson has created the absolute epitome of this genre. \n\nThe characters are all perfectly cast and perfectly played by each and every actor from the main cast to the extras. To name a few Vigo Mortenson as Aragorn is sublime, Ian Mckellan as Gandalf is fabulous and Elijah Wood as Frodo is true the nature of Frodo and his age defining quest.  \n\nTo conclude, it is without doubt cinema at its very perfection and as I have already mentioned, we shall never see its like again. \n\nA heartfelt and sincere thank you to Peter Jackson, for creating such an incredible and beautiful piece of visual art that has defined cinema as we know it. \n\nNi 'lassui En",

This is packed with more thrills, more emotion, more epic battles and spectacular effects, and more poetry than even the first two wonderful films. Everyone from the cast brings their A-game, and everyone gets their moment or two to shine. This leg of the journey is fraught with tension, frights, and brings you to the edge of your seat.

            "content": "\"The Return of the King\" is by far the most moving, inspirational, and epic of Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings Trilogy movies. The movie plot is compelling with themes of friendship, strength, and loyalty. Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee continue their quest to destroy the One Ring at Mount Doom led by Gollum. Gollum becomes more cunning and sneaky than ever. Gandalf the White, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli regroup with Merry and Pippin in Isengard, and they learn that Sauron is planning a full-scale attack on the largest city of men, Minas Tirith in Gondor. The rest of the Fellowship prepares for another battle to hold Minas Tirith against an onslaught of the armies of Mordor. A distress called is sent to Rohan, and King Theoden is able muster a large army of Rohirrim, to set out for Minas Tirith. After the free people's victory at the Battle Pelennor Fields, the Fellowship what remaining forces of Gondor and Rohan that they have and storm the Black Gate to distract the Eye of Sauron's gaze and buy time for Frodo to finish his quest. The movie set for Minas Tirith, The City of Kings, is very gorgeous. The lighting of the beacon is authentic. The costumes, weapons, armor, props and movie sets are very well tailored by the film crew. The special effects for the army of the Dead (oathbreakers), Gollum, Shelob the spider, the mumakil, the eagles, Sauron's Eye, the fellbeasts and the trolls are breathtaking and incredible. The movie visuals for Minas Tirith, Pelennor Fields, Osgiliath, The Grey Havens, Mordor, The Black Gate, Mount Doom, Minas Morgul and Shelob's Lair are spectacular. King Thedeon's speech at Pelennor Fields and Aragorn's speech at the Black Gate are some of the best movie battle speeches ever. The heroism and romance are incredibly moving. Gandalf's speech to Pippin about death being another path to take in life is so emotional. Sam Gamgee's devotion to Frodo is something that can show what true friendship is. The battles are amazing and always heightening the tension. The tension for the siege on Minas Tirith is so highly anticipated. The acting and the cast crew are superb. Sir Ian McKellen is flawless in his role as Gandalf the White. Viggo Mortenssen is at his charismatic in his role as Aragorn. Sean Astin captures Samwise Gamgee perfectly and is able to provide the character's heart. Andy Serkis provides a stirring and great performance as Smeagol/Gollum. Orlando Bloom as Legolas and John Rhys-Davies as Gimli carry their roles very well. Elijiah Wood gives a great performance as Frodo Baggins descending into corruption with an incredible talent. Dominic Monaghan (Merry) and Billy Boyd (Pippin) still make a great duo. David Wenham is particularly good in his role as Faramir. John Noble gives a brilliant performance as the tragic and broken Lord Denethor. Bruce Spencer was wonderful in his role as the treacherous Mouth of Sauron in the extended edition. Lawrence Makoare was incredible in his role as Gothmog, the orc lieutenant from Minas Morgul. The rest of the cast including Bernard Hill, Mirianda Otto, Karl Urban, Ian Holm, Liv Tyler, Cate Blanchett and Hugo Weaving are perfect in their roles. The Battle of Pelennor Fields is still the most spectacular and epic battle sequences in Hollywood movie history. The visual effects of battle at Minas Tirith are stunning and perfectly executed. The incredible scope of the battle with the special effects, sounds, and many close-ups of pieces of the action make for an exciting scene. The final stand at the Black Gate is so emotional involving and is done so with vision beyond imagination. The many endings that follow are brilliant.",

The filming was also excellent, and the special effects were very well thought out. The music was well synchronised with the atmosphere, which gave the impression of living the scene.

The Ride of Rohirrim is not a Deus Ex Machina as it is constantly being built up on the other side.

I personally think Two Towers is the best for its scope and better exploration of some of the characters, but while it is still great Return of the King is better than Fellowship of the Ring.\n\nMy only slight disappointment is the ending, it does feel overlong and bloated for me, almost as if there was more than one ending filmed. That said, what does make the ending at least watchable for me is the way it is shot, the marvellous score and the performance of Gollum.\n\nDespite this minor discrepancy, Return of the King is extremely good and in my view one of the better Best Picture winners last decade. Peter Jackson's direction is very impressive here, and the scope is massive and just dazzling to watch. All three films of the trilogy are very well made, but Return of the King defines the term epic. The cinematography is mind-blowing, the scenery is superb, the costumes and make-up are well tailored, the effects are superb and don't distract too much and the lighting is authentic.\n\nThe score is phenomenal. Fellowship of the Ring had some ethereal, rousing, haunting and charming themes, whereas Two Towers was somewhat darker and more complex. Return of the King merges these together and the result is a perfect mixture of charm, darkness, etherality and complexity. The story is compelling with themes of friendship, strength and loyalty, the screenplay is well-written and literate and while the film is very long the three hours or so fly by seamlessly. The characters are engaging, Aragorn is even more interesting here than he is in the previous films while Gollum continues to steal every scene he appears in.\n\nThe acting is very good. Orlando Bloom(who I can find dashing yet uncharismatic and bland) and John Rhys-Davies are given less to do but do carry their parts very well, and Elijah Wood is likable enough. Sean Astin captures Sam perfectly and provides the heart of the picture, and Viggo Mortenssen is at his charismatic best here. Ian McKellen is perfectly cast, while the design of Gollum is still superb and Andy Serkis is equally phenomenal. I was slightly disappointed by the lack of any Sarauman, but I was more than I was satisfied with the final result.\n\nAll in all, an outstanding entry to a great trilogy. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

And when it does, you better not blink because you'll miss something.\n\nSome things I thought while watching:\nI counted two wilhelm screams\u2026 as stated before, it's not a proper fight scene without one!\nGimli is still the best character, Aragorn is still awesome, and Legolas is still performed poorly (acting wise).\nI rather liked Smeagol\u2026 he was cute(?) for a minute there. Plus he's a master class deceiver and that's pretty sick\nHow many times is Sam going to say \"Mr. Frodo!\"\nThe SCORE!!!! I will never get over how the score(s) made me feel. The emotions start stirring HEAVILY\nWow Frodo was the absolute worst the entire first two movies but hey maybe I like him in this one\nI've said it once and I'll say it again, Gandolf is FAST like he's apparently 24,000 years old and dude can sprint!!! It's insane\nPLEASE JUST LET GO!\nSo THATS why it's called The Return of the King!\nGood heavens this ending is devastating.\n\nIt's good. It's great even. Honestly, it's amazing.

It adapts by far the worst source material of the three and really pays the price for it with one of the worst cases of deus ex machina in movie history (the ghosts); the director thankfully chose to excise the worst chapter of writing Tolkien ever produced, that being the Hobbits returning to the Shire to find that Saruman has taken it over, but a lot of the buildup to Frodo's eventual character-ruining refusal to destroy the ring was internal and wasn't conveyed in the movie. We are instead left with a protagonist (who had already become worthless halfway through the second movie) making a heel turn long after all respect for him had been lost.   I think a few of the Oscar wins this received was based on accrued appreciation for the trilogy as a whole and a lack of significant competition in '03. There was still plenty to enjoy here, especially the epilogue, and making this movie at all was a tremendous achievement by the filmmakers.",

            "content": "This is my third and final review of the trilogy. In the first movie's review I called it an RPG game and mentioned on how the world building was done adn how great the visuals were. In the second review I said it was like watching a book come to life and talked about the character development and philosophy/message the movie gave. In this third review I have called it an art and here I will talk about the story and why it will be remembered not just as a masterpiece, but also as a legacy. Keep in mind that all the reviews have been written separately but all of them imply to all three movies.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings is one long story that has been divided equally among three movies. Because of this there is virtually no major difference between the them, and all the three movies have received almost the same ratings. Normally in trilogies the stories do not directly pick up from where the last one left but rather these are three different stories, because of which it is possible to have two great movies and one movie which does not live up to them (Sam Raimi's Spider-Man, Christopher Nolan's Batman, the original Star Wars trilogy, Godfather etc), or there is one great movie while the other two don't live up to that (Zack Snyder's Superman, Star Wars prequel and sequel trilogies, Jurassic Park etc).\n\nHere the risk was much bigger. Since there is just one story, either the entire trilogy would have been good or the entire trilogy would have been bad. This is why the movies were so long. The story is set in a fantasy world and not everyone has read the original books by JRR Tolkien. So Peter Jackson had to elaborate every minor detail. There should have been no questions left. The audience should've had a clear idea of what they were watching. Normally such things are only possible in TV shows which are book adaptations like Game of Thrones or The Man in the High Castle since they have enough time in their hands to explain everything. This, however, was a movie series. This is the reason why the runtime is so long. The total runtime of the trilogy is 10+ hours, and 12+ hours if you watch the extended cut.\n\nAnother major problem that could have plagued this movie, if it wasn't addressed, was the number of characters and the fact that all of them were in different places doing different things. There were some minor characters right in the beginning of the story and some in the middle. All of them had to be humanised, something which is possible only if we get to know more about them. Because of this the story is moved forward such that we are made to care about all of the people. While we ask what happened to Gimli and Legolas in the battle, we are also worried that Frodo has been tricked by Gollum and is about to be eaten by a giant spider. The direction does not shift in the bias of any of the characters, otherwise the ones the audience cares about would have been left behind. People often make fun of the half-hour long epilogue shown in the end of The Return of the King, but imagine if it was not there. So many characters would have received vague endings. This was meant to assure that all the good characters got good endings and the bad guys got bad endings.\n\nI'd also take a moment to talk about Gimli and Legolas' relation. In the beginning they both hated each other but later on they grow to become friends. This is another great message that the movie sends us. In my previous review of philosophy I didn't mention it because it was seen in this movie. It talks about how we hate some people based on their appearance, their beliefs, their way of life. But we end up becoming friends with those same people once we actually interact with them. People were never meant to hate each other. This is something we are taught to do. This is also seen when Aragorn unleases the Army of the Dead. They never wanted to work with the living because of their hatred, but when one of them came forward and made the request, they gave in. It is these small moments that show the humanity in all the characters.\n\nAnd finally, what makes it a legacy? Today everyone knows about The Lord of the Rings. Gandalf is the first thing someone imagines when they hear the word \"wizard\", in spite of there being a more popular book adaptation movie franchise which is literally about wizards. So many RPG games have their stories set in the manner of \"some characters with different abilities go out on a dangerous yet exotic adventure\". Elijah Wood has become world famous for his role as Frodo Baggins. Gollum, in spite of being the same annoying character found in all fantasy movies, is more popular than Jar Jar or Dobby. All of this is possible because of the way the story unfolds. Everyone who was evil was simply so because of the circumstances, and those who were good were because of how much the story emphasised on their actions. This coupled with great direction and a good world building made it so popular.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings is one of the era defining movies of our times. It looks like a painting brought to life, one that we used to look at in fairy tales and nursery rhymes. It is the first thing that comes to someone's mind when they think of a fantasy adventure set in the medieval era. The patience of the creators and the fans is what made this trilogy so powerful. I really hope we get to see more such adaptations of books that we haven't heard about. This one has made a benchmark that will be hard to reach in the near future unless a miracle happens.",

Upon finding that Sauron plans to strike the city of Minas Tirith, the heart of Gondor, Gandalf and Pippin ride to the city only to find Denethor, a madman in control of the city who is totally unfit to be the Steward. Eventually, the forces of Gondor, Rohan, Eriador and Mordor all coincide at Minas Tirith for the largest and in my opinion, best battle not only in this saga, but in all of cinematic history. Every scene in this movie holds weight to it, it is my favourite in the trilogy and seeing Aragorn finally take his place becoming King of the Reunited Kingdom always brings a tear to my black heart.

In terms of acting as the Climax of the Trilogy, is most certainly contains the most adrenaline-pumping sequences, almost all of them top-tier excellent, and the emotional payoff to this Trilogy is highly effective.  The performances are solid-to-excellent across the board, and as before, the Artistic and Technical merits are both outstanding.  Like the others, it has stood the test of time, it now being 18 years old at the time of my review, and while I am certainly open to the idea of more Middle Earth content existing to expand upon this Tale (some games like War in the North and Shadow of Mordor doing a surprisingly good job), I genuinely hope they don't attempt to tell the Lord of the Rings (proper) ever again, as it might very well be impossible to do better than this Trilogy did.  It's inspirational, it's emotional, it will make you cheer and will make your eyes watery, and all three of these have rightfully gone into the History Books of Cinema.",

But that doesn't matter one jot whatsoever, as the story wraps up in arguably the best way - at least to watch - possible. It has so much heart and feeling to it.\n\nThe story involving the characters of Elijah Wood, Sean Astin and Andy Serkis remained the most interesting to me, I was very satisfied with how it concluded in regards to them. I also enjoyed the bits we got of Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen & Co. All that added to the beautiful look and creation of the film, with the world coming alive splendidly.\n\nIf I were to nit-pick further, I would say the run time is slightly too long. The pacing is absolutely fine, very good in fact, but I coulda done without a few of the many end scenes - a lot of which are necessary and welcome, but a couple could've been left out to allow the viewer to imagine how the world continued. That's just how I feel mind, I'm sure I'm one of only a few that think that way.\n\nBack onto the positives: how about those battle sequences? Astonishingly good.

After the first two parts followed the journey of the fateful ring and served as an ideal set-up for the final chapter, The Return of the King brings along everything we love: Action, emotional moments and, for the time, unthinkably artistic images and great visual effects.\n\nAs in the first two parts, the cast does not stand out for individual performance. It's the whole collective that makes the difference and once again shines with its unique chemistry. Above all, the interpersonal relationships come out even more in the third part. Frodo (Elijah Wood) and his loyal gardener Sam (Sean Astin) provide several scenes in which their unbreakable friendship and affection for each other becomes clear. Especially in the conflict with the malicious Gollum (Andy Serkis), these are constantly put to the test. Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn always seems like the insider protagonist. He acts very altruistically and never leaves the side of his allies. In interactions with the cheeky Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom) he also has quite funny moments. Ian McKellen is a fixed presence in his comeback as Gandalf, as he so often is, and makes us forget his absence from the second part with his wisdom and authenticity.\n\nEach part of The Lord of the Rings is special in its own way. What sets The Return of the King ahead of its two predecessors is that the story is told out in the almost three hours of running time. As a result, intense scenes take place almost every minute, which are captivating the audience. Contrary to other fantasy dramas, this one also does not contain too many cheesy moments. It is nevertheless a pity that the few female roles in this film are mostly reduced to these. Nevertheless, Peter Jackson has created a masterpiece with this trilogy that is still unrivalled, especially in terms of the visual factor. For the manageable resources available in the early 2000s, The Lord of the Rings paved the way for the technical revolution in Hollywood. The Return of the King is a closing chapter to this breathtaking three-parter.",

The visuals, sets, makeup, costumes and music are just as perfect as the previous movies, all the cast give expressive emotional performances, the stakes are incredibly high so it leads to an exciting and suspenseful movie, there are so many excellent character moments especially with Sam and Aragorn, the battle sequences are genuinely the best ever put to movie, it's perfectly paced with no boring parts and it's so emotional. Those last 30 minutes made me cry hard. This is how you end a trilogy. It ends the story and journey for each characters in an emotionally satisfying way and I could gush about how perfect it is for hours and hours. Also, that \u2018For Frodo' line is the best line in the trilogy.",

I never sensed any of the main characters were in any real danger and I knew they would be protected by their plot armor at every turn. All the main characters go through all this combat and all these battles where the odds are against them, and yet they emerge with hardly a scratch. Each of these movies is too damn long. You can't convince me this movie definitely had to be over 4 hours. There was plenty that could have been trimmed. And if they didn't want to do that, they desperately needed to break each of these films up into 2 movies. That said, the world-building is as good as any movie. The giant elephants and eagles and dragons and trees are all pretty cool. The story is just a bit too disney-like to me. The characters have minimal flaws and are never short on altruism or bravery. The characters are just not that believable. These are good movies but IMDB has all 3 of them in the top 15 all time. I would never put any of them that high. Still worth a watch at least once.",

            "content": "Peter Jackson's The Return of the King is one of those good fantasy films to end one of the most popular trilogies. Frodo (Elijah Wood), Sam (Sean Astin) and Gollum (Andy Serkis) travel to Mount Doom in Mordor to destroy the One Ring, only to be betrayed by Gollum. Gandalf (Ian McKellan), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and the other Fellowship members team up with Theoden's army from Rohan, the Army of the Dead and the great eagles to defeat Sauron's army. Meanwhile, Arwen (Liv Tyler), worrying about the fate of Aragorn and Middle-Earth, chooses mortality and slowly dies during the war, only to live in the end. Normally, I don't get invested in these epic fantasy films or television series because it takes time to sink into the environments and characters before I confuse one name over another, like Brego (Aragorn's horse) with Snowmane (Theodon's horse). So when I see The Lord of the Rings (a franchise that contains hundreds of Hobbits, elves, warriors, monarchs, wizards or Orcs and has three-plus hours worth of films), I have to recognize the actors' faces or research them before I learn their character names, specifically for minor ones. However, that does not mean I can't watch The Return of the King and enjoy myself, especially if it's really good.  While I got invested in the epic battle in Pelennor Field with the Mumakil and Fell Beasts, I had resentment for the giant eagles which could have taken the Hobbits to Mount Doom and have them drop the ring in the lava. Also, unless you weren't suckered into seeing the extended cut, you ended up scratching your head wondering where Saruman (Christopher Lee) went since The Two Towers. Nitpicking aside, I enjoyed the action, the character interactions, the costume design, and the emotional ending. \n\n(4 Extended Blu Ray Versions out of 5)",

For this whole trilogy, it is about the journey and the end instead of the phrase \"Its about the journey, not the end\" and I think that it's about the journey and the end really sums up the whole trilogy. I love the character arcs in this film I really do to see Frodo change and to see Aragorn change really makes me feel good inside to see that I have experienced something truly amazing. This is one of the best films ever made and every aspect of film making is at its best in this film nothing will top the quality of this film in my opinion. I think of the whole trilogy as the three acts for Frodo the Fellowship is the first act exposition and the inciting incident and The Two Towers is the second act, rising action and Return of the King is the climax and the resolution that's how I think it is for everyone else it is the normal three act structure for everyone except for Frodo in my opinion. I just can't stop talking about the fabulous score it just is amazing and I don't know how some can not like at all. These films really challenge the morals of everyone in them especially Frodo with the ring. I love the costumes they made for the whole trilogy and I just learned that they filmed these back to back which is very interesting and I think that is the only film to ever do that. I love how all of the storylines just smoothly weave themselves together. If there is one actor that deserves an Oscar more than anyone in Hollywood right now it Andy Serkis I will preach it until he wins for motion capture because he is better at motion capture than some actors working today. The buildup to the battle/war at the end is amazing and will be one of the best battles ever created and put to screen. I love Elijah Wood's acting in this he has such an emotional range in this trilogy and it is kinda sad that he got snubbed. I love the spider sequence so much there is to much tension and suspense in that scene and the tension and suspense are created amazingly in this film and the set design I absolutely loved for the sequence. I love the final battle/war so much and when they are fighting and the score kicks in and it feels amazing and that's when you feel like you have waited for this since the beginning of Fellowship. That will remain my favorite battle of all time and this has some of my favorite scenes of all time and it will remain my favorite ending of all time and it will remain the best ending of all time in my opinion. The ending really paid off after we have been with everyone through this whole trilogy it is kinda sad to not see them in anything else. I can safely say that this is the best trilogy of all time and I have so much nostalgia for the whole franchise and I hope they release the Fellowship next year for the 20th anniversary. One thing I will say is that spoilers if you haven't seen it just read the next paragraph I love that they crown Aragorn and give the hobbits the respect that they need and deserve because without them they couldn't have returned the ring.\n\nI love the score and I will keep praising it until I die because dang if it is not the best score of all time and the most iconic in my opinion. The sound mixing and the sound editing is amazing in the war at the end with all of the action and the sound and the score it really feels like you are mixed with the amazing cinematography it really feels like you are there with them. I love the location for the final battle it looks amazing looking at New Zealand and the whole set looks amazing. Like before the color grading is amazing and looks amazing against the New Zealand background. The script is amazing and one of my favorites and the character development I absolutely love and finishing the character arcs just fills me with joy inside. I love the action in the final scene and it is better than some of the action films nowadays and the action in all is fabulous and it has two of my favorite battles of all time. The makeup and prosthetics look amazing, so much better than what the Hobbit did. Overall I would recommend this to everyone on the planet.\n\ud83d\udcaf%",

High praise to the music throughout echoing the fantasy, the fighting and the impact of the ring. The cast is excellent with a script coming straight out the pages of Tolkien's book. Its hard to name a stand out as everyone does a great job, i enjoyed Sean Astin as Sam, Frodo's companion, Viggo Mortensen offers class and Ian McKellen is always watchable. The battle scenes containing so many characters and must have taken a long time to edit and the camera pans across many different angles as we look from a birds eyes view and close ups. Its looks and feels very dramatic. The make up of the army from Mordor is extremely impressive as a very horrific look. The emotional scenes strengthen the film, and i did tear up as Aragorn says you bow to know one to the Hobbits. The film is very long and could have finished earlier, but we need the sense that the Hobbits get back to real life and things try to get back to normal. It is fine for Sam but Frodo holding the ring has changed. The film feels very mythical and religious. Spiritual elements echo through the film. Frodo and Sams adventure leads to a spider which is a very frightening scene feeling very tense. One of the best fantasy films ever made, you sense the love of being involved from the actors, to the production team. A well deserved Oscar winner.",

Fellowship introduces us to the franchise, Two Towers gives us arguably the best character development and plot advancement, and Return of the King is essentially a three act epic within a larger three act epic; you could argue it's the \"ring cycle\" of fantasy cinema. The third instalment is a monumental piece of filmmaking, masterfully written and acted, visually everything about the film is breathtaking, and each plot strand ties into one another so incredibly well, as it has done since the Fellowship all went their separate ways. Elijah Wood absolutely knocks it out of the park as ever, portraying Frodo's gradual descent into the ring of power's control, and the physical and psychological toll it takes on him with absolute aplomb. Ian McKellen is always a domineering presence on stage or screen, and there could not have been a better cast for Gandalf if they had tried, this is where he really comes into his own as the kind hearted, yet fierce and noble white wizard. Whilst every cast member was spectacular, particular kudos has go to Andy Serkis, whom has become synonymous with the mentally unhinged Gollum/Sm\u00e9agol, and seeing him portray the character's pre-ring self and subsequent descent into madness was an absolute joy. Visuals and acting aside, the real star of the show is Howard Shore's magnificent score, he must go down as one of the all-time greats of film composition, as the LOTR trilogy film score is one I could just sit and listen to on repeat. I could sit and gush about what makes this such an incredible achievement in cinema until the cows come home, all you need to know really is this: Lord of the Rings is a masterpiece of a trilogy, and anyone who thinks otherwise just doesn't understand it.",

With the movie focusing on the destruction of the almighty and powerful Ring, that corrupts almost all that touch it and Frodo was tasked with the deliverance of it to Mount Doom. On the way there, he met the fabled Gollum who was a hobbit once born in the same shire, but got corrupted by the Ring. Sam and Frodo met him on their adventure, and since Gollum knew the way to the volcano better than both Sam and Frodo he lead them to there. The Gollum and Sm\u00e9agol battle was brilliantly played out, and it started my love/hate feelings for the character. Gollum was the corrupted version of Sm\u00e9agol, and he desire for getting the ring kept growing throughout the movie. The movie was the best of the trilogy in my opinion, and it was a beautiful coda to this masterpiece.",

The Dead King and co. are a well realised, visually cool bunch of deus ex machina and Gandalf steeling Merry for death is a beautiful moment. The final battle flows extremely well, it's nothing tonally alike to the filthy last stand at Helms Deep, this is trained army vs trained army. The focus of Aragorn's conclusion to be crowned rightfully King is satisfying and the right icing on the cake. \n\nRegarding the extended edition, it's made weakest of the three only insofar as the theatrical of Return of the King is the most complete and impressive of the three. However, the opening scenes of Sauron are the most required and missed from the theatrical and I'm in favour of the many endings of this film because after 11 hours of movie, it earns the right to take an hour to draw to a close.",

            "content": "Epic and majesty!\n\nThis review will be not so much about The Return of the King, but about the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy as a whole, because it is perceived by me as completely and unanimously as possible. I cannot divide this global history into parts, and therefore I will speak about everything here.\n\nSince I last watched The Lord of the Rings, 6 years have passed, which is probably the biggest break, and I decided to rediscover Middle-earth. Moreover, the Fellowship of the Ring recently celebrated its 20th anniversary. First time watching it with subtitles. I watched, of course, the director's versions, which I strongly recommend to everyone. If you have not watched the director's cuts of this trilogy, then you cannot assume that you have watched The Lord of the Rings at all. This is one of the few films where the theatrical versions are not really complete, which affects the perception.\n\nI see no point in writing something about this, without a doubt, the greatest film trilogy. Everyone knows everything and so - these are films in which all the elements converged in the best way: the script, director's work, camera work, cast and acting, special effects, makeup, costumes, music, atmosphere - absolutely everything! And such an epic saga was not filmed either before or after. Even Peter Jackson himself failed to repeat his success in The Hobbits. Everything that can be good in a movie is good here. The Oscar record speaks for itself, because at that time this award had not yet discredited itself.\n\nEven the Russian dubbing here is one of the best. This time I watched, of course, without him, but on some scenes I specifically included dubbing in order to listen and compare. And almost everywhere it is flawless! As if the original voices spoke in Russian!\n\nI actually just found out this year that there are people who don't like The Lord of the Rings! For me it was a surprise. Paradoxically, with each viewing, I love these films more and more and always find something new in them and somehow rediscover them. Not a single part seems boring or drawn out to me - everything is in its place.\n\nAnd The Return of the King, which is a whopping 4 hours long (I have never seen longer films), looks at all in one breath. I love long films in general, but other long films like The Godfathers, Once Upon a Time in America or The Irishman don't compare to the ease of watching the third Lord of the Rings. I don't know how the creators managed it, that 4 hours fly by faster than when watching some one and a half hour movies.\n\nSome blame the ending separately for the delay, but I think this is absolutely unjustified. In such a large-scale epic, there cannot be a quick end, because all the storylines must be closed. And 40 minutes of denouement was not even enough for me personally. The final scene is synonymous with the phrase \"light sadness.\" This is perhaps the only fictional universe on the screen that I really really did not want to say goodbye. Yes, I would generally watch these films for ages, if there was such an opportunity.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings is truly great. This one definitely deserves the status of a cult classic. I give the highest score to each film and the entire trilogy as a whole! Unconditional masterpieces!",

A bunch of battles happen and then the One Ring finally gets destroyed as Gollum is thrown into the fires of Mount Doom while he holds it. Aragorn becomes king, everybody is happy and they all bow to the 4 hobbits.\n\nMy head hurts just thinking about this film and all of the things that occur seemingly for no reason as we interact with people who have reactions and motivations that don't seem vaguely understandable. I needed something, something to care about and this film gave me nothing. The ring is evil and must be destroyed so that Sauron can't take over the world but why do we spend so much time getting to Mount Doom and why do there have to be so many extraneous plot elements. The same screenwriting team worked on this film as all the others and they seem to have abandoned all attempts to humanize the characters and explain the plot developments. Those were the only reasons that I liked The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) and with a complete absence of that in this film I really couldn't connect.\n\nAs with the first two films the visuals were dazzling and I have no criticisms of the special effects used and everything looks beautiful. Unfortunately these visuals weren't in service of a great or even coherent story. Films like Blade Runner (1982) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) use gorgeous visuals to draw you into dark stories that comment on our place in the world as humans and our relationship to technology, this film has none of that depth. Why couldn't Peter Jackson who made a great film in Heavenly Creatures (1994) explore something deeper than good vs. evil over a lethargically paced 2 hours and 40 minutes.\n\nLiterally the only moment that shook me out of my stupor was the kiss at the end but that was my lizard brain talking as I had been thinking about how great The Bridges of Madison County (1995) was instead of torturing myself with this movie. Had any of the female characters had more screen time, we see Arwen have a vision of Aragorn and her son and at the end she is Aragorn's prize, maybe I could have engaged. Eowyn technically carries out an important action but we don't really spend any time with her and Otto and the lesser actress Tyler get nothing to work with. Oh my, Lost in Translation is a better written and directed film than this.\n\nThis may be the worst Best Picture winner ever, I'm serious it's worse than Gandhi (1982) and The Broadway Melody (1929). At this point I'm seriously annoyed that this is a thing that even exists, let the fans have their books but don't inflict an entire series of films on the human race. Don't see this unless you absolutely hate yourself because it's a real chore to get through and you are left with nothing at the end of it.",

            "content": "Fifteen years since The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King was released the effects of this movie have never been more apparent.  The level of influence this movie has is almost as big as its trophy case; or, 11 Oscars, 4 Golden Globes, and numerous other awards.  This was the event that brought geek culture to the forefront of the minds of Hollywood's directors.  Even today, a decade and a half later, the Marvel Universe has Middle Earth to thank as it dominates the box office with both \"Geeks\" and \"Non-Geeks\" flocking to theaters worldwide.  No longer are superheroes, magic creatures, or fairy tales things for nerds.  The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, specifically The Return of the King destroyed the stigma around the genre and word \"Geek\".  More than just a great ending to a timeless saga, the release of this movie was a cultural movement and catalyst that brought about changes not only in the movie industry, but throughout the world\nThe anticipation leading up to this concluding chapter was that of legend, and director Peter Jackson does not disappoint with this final film.  Through the effective use of character development, music, and attention to detail, the themes from the Lord of the Rings saga by J.R.R. Tolkien's masterpiece are brought to life one last time.  Hailed by critics the world round, Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King exceeds expectations and becomes an instant classic.  \n\tThe level of character development in The Return of the King cannot be understated.  The depth that Jackson goes to with each individual character over the course of the 200-minute movie help us to better understand individuals and their important roles in the story, as well as transport us to the land of middle earth for a front row seat to the war to end all wars.  The film opens up with a flash back of Sm\u00e9agol's life pre-Gollum.  The typically CGI (Computer Generated Image) Andy Serkis gives us a quick glimpse of a once playful, and loving Hobbit right before the ring takes hold of him and transforms him over the course of close to 500 years into the evil Gollum.  This scene is key as it gives insight to the level of power the ring has, and the immense burden taken on by the ring bearer.  Towards the end of the movie this is illustrated nicely by the markings around Frodo's neck from the chain on which he carries the ring.  Although the physical changes are the most obvious, the emotional changes we see in the hero are even more shocking on screen.  \n\tFrodo is a character we see change over the course of the trilogy as the ring takes its toll over the course of the year long journey.  Physically speaking Frodo appears weak and depends more upon Sam and Gollum to make the trek.  His emotions change as well, as the naturally cheery hobbit becomes more impatient, and less trusting, as well as more shrill and critical of Sam.  Just as the ring, and his travels have taken a negative toll on Frodo, The Return of the King does a magnificent job at illustrating quite the opposite for Samwise Gamgee.  \n\tPortrayed as the dimwitted friend, or clumsy sidekick at the beginning of the saga, Samwise takes very seriously his charge to watch over Mr. Frodo.  Going against his shy and  reserved nature, Sam's transformation is wonderfully completed and portrayed by Sean Astin.  The hero of The Goonies, Rudy, and other films has his crowning and most famous performance here as he proves once a fool doesn't mean always a fool.  Even when Frodo casts Sam away under false pretenses, Sam obeys but quickly forgives and comes back more determined than ever to destroy the source of Frodo's delusion.  Countless other examples of Jackson's masterful use of character development bring this movie to life better than any other in the trilogy.  We can see this influence throughout cinema today as well, as audiences are no longer satisfied with explosions and fight scenes alone.  Even the simplest stories now feature extremely deep character development and transformation.   Tony Stark wasn't always the caring, emotional individual we see in recent films after all.  \nThe extended edition of these films gives even more insight to character motives, and personality traits.  One of the best examples of this is in a scene where the last remaining soldiers from Minas Tirith follow Aragon to the black gate in an effort to draw Sauron's eye and give Frodo the best chance at destroying the ring.  The deleted scene shows the Mouth of Sauron come out to meet the group, and he gives them a \"token\".  He then throws Frodo's Mithril vest at Aragon and talks about the torture they inflicted on him.  Even something as small as this gives us a better understanding to why the fellowship thinks Frodo is dead, and they fight with increased raw emotion and vigor.  The effects used to enhance this scene such as slow motion, camera angles, and music create the perfect blend of emotions.  Jackson's strong supporting cast each help create the perfect environment for an epic hero story such as this.  \n\tThe London Philharmonic under the direction of the great Howard Shore play an integral role in the experience that is The Return of the King.  The perfect blend of strings and wind instruments polish off the majesty of the Elves, while the strong percussion and deeper brass instruments create a tangible tension in the air during the monstrous battles, or any moments involving the fearsome Uruk Hai.   The music almost goes unnoticed at seemingly insignificant parts of the film, but when paying close attention as one must in this film, true fans of Tolkien will realize the vital role the music plays in this final chapter of the saga.  From the playful recorder melody that is the Shire theme song, to the unmistakable powerful percussion and thunderous tubas in the Isengard theme, this score features a full spectrum of instruments that Shore has arranged perfectly to bring to light underlying themes and help the audience make connections between scenes, as well as help us follow the intense web of storylines found in Lord of the Rings. Jackson uses the music as well as subtle transitional tricks to help the viewer understand where they are in the story as it bounces between the paths of the remaining members of the Fellowship. \n\tWatching The Return of the King one will come to appreciate the seemingly minute details that really tie the story together.  An excellent example of this comes in a scene where Frodo and Sam find themselves in the tower Cirith Ungol.  As Frodo lies stripped of his clothes by Orcs, we see his body covered in scars that we can connect back to previous experiences he has had along his travels.  Specifically, the scars left by the Morgul blade from the Witch King of Angmar at Weathertop.  From the little tears in the costumes or props, to the amazing work done by the Foley artists to bring the cringeworthy sounds like Gollum biting into a fish, or the ear-piercing sound of the Nazgul, all contribute to the magic.  \n\tThe focus of this movie is obviously on the acting, and Jackson has stressed that although a large portion of this movie is CGI the acting and people involved should drive the story.  That being said, one cannot go without mentioning the unbelievable, and awe-inspiring aspect of the movie that is the special effects.  From the grotesque creatures and gigantic structures, to the small hobbits that are the focal point of the trilogy; all aspects of the CGI realm big and small are done flawlessly.  One leaves the movie almost forgetting that Elijah Wood, Sean Astin and company aren't actually three feet tall.  No detail is too small for Peter Jackson and the rest of the genius minds that make up the production team. \n\tNever before has the story of the unlikely hero been so well illustrated.   Each character deals with different challenges, and the way they respond to said challenges determines their fate.  In a movie with plenty to offer us, J.R.R. Tolkien and Peter Jackson do a wonderful job at subtly teaching us life lessons that never fade from relevance.  This instant classic-- while entertaining and loveable at face value-- takes on whole new meaning for those fans willing to ponder and interpret this cinematic masterpiece.  Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King takes its place among the greatest movies in cinematic history thanks to the memorable characters, the timeless soundtrack, and the masterful display of detailed special effects.  Peter Jackson has cemented his place as one of the greats with this closing chapter of the beloved classic saga.",

Gollum is particularly funny in this one. \n\nIt's so upsetting to see how that one king loved his son Boromir but loathes his other son. Wow. That scene with the king eating like a pig, his son and the soldiers charging towards their death, and Pippin singing was iconic. That was masterfully done. \n\nAll the dead army scenes were amazing. What an amazing feeling that would be to have a ghost army as your ally fighting by your side. That battle scene was crazy! That one orc that comes out on horse from the gate was one ugly motherfucker. \n\nI can see why this movie is regarded as the best of the three and is seen as one of the best movies made. It's supremely epic in scale. The plot thickens and gets better and better as time goes by. What's great about this one is that there's a lot of character development going on. You really get to see everyone's true potential. Even the little hobbits.",

            "content": "Voglio fare una recensione unica per questa trilogia cercando di essere il pi\u00f9 breve e conciso possibile. Intanto parto col dire che \u00e8 la Trilogia fantastica per eccellenza, ormai divenuta cult, perfetta sotto quasi ogni aspetto. Ogni cosa \u00e8 resa al meglio e non ci sono difetti dal punto di vista tecnico; regia di Peter Jackson perfetta, fotografia bellissima e effetti speciali da paura. Le scenografie, le ambientazioni, il trucco e i costumi sono eccellenti. Le musiche e il montaggio delle musiche azzeccatissimi. Dal punto di vista narrativo nulla da dire anche perch\u00e9 non ho letto i libri, purtroppo. Il personaggio che pi\u00f9 mi \u00e8 piaciuto \u00e8 stato Samvise, interpretato da Sean Astin che \u00e8 stato semplicemente magnifico; senza di lui Frodo non avrebbe fatto tutto quello che ha fatto, il vero Eroe della trilogia, soprattutto nell'ultimo film (\"Il Ritorno del Re\"). Spettacolari anche Ian McKellen (Gandalf), che ha regalato diverse perle divenute cult, e Andy Serkis che ha interpretato Gollum, personaggio bello e brutto allo stesso tempo. Di grandissima potenza i dialoghi di Gollum che ha due personalit\u00e0, Smeagol (il suo nome originale) e appunto Gollum. Ottimi anche gli altri personaggi. Gli ultimi 50 minuti del terzo film sono di una intensit\u00e0 pazzesca, perfetti sotto ogni punto di vista. Tra i tre film ovviamente ho preferito il terzo ma son tutti e tre fantastici, trilogia UNICA firmata Peter Jackson.",

The huge battle scenes are slightly frightening but are definitely fun to watch and it's very satisfying to see the good guys outnumbered and backup coming to drive all the orcs away. I'll say that it's the best film in the trilogy because of how good an ending it is. If I had to give an order, it would be this as #1, the first as #2 and the middle one as #3. All of them are phenomenal and there's no doubt about it. This is my favorite, but not by far because of what I said. Again, Peter Jackson does an incredible job directing and creating the film so well. The screenplay adaptation is extremely well written for the screen based of the book. This definitely deserves to be a winner of eleven Academy Awards which this and only two other films have won. That definitely shows how good it is. Overall, it's an emotional and satisfying ending that fans will most surely enjoy and is again, phenomenal.",

            "content": "The problem with imagination is that it is an individual event, a unique subjective experience that a single person experiences completely alone. Those who enter into the realm of Art, Fiction, Fantasy, and any degree of Story-telling agree (willingly or no) to take that personal act of creation and primal nature and share it with the community of human beings, each of whom has his or her own imaginative context. It is a bold act of sacrifice, self-confidence, and faith (spiritual, one could argue) to thrust the contents of one's subjective reality into (to borrow from Douglas Adams) the Whole Sort of General Mish Mash. People who do so deserve respect for the mere creative act, the ability to foist forward what they believe is true. From Homer to Bill O'Reilly, this concept of personal creation, what Tolkien called Sub-Creation, is the essence of modern human existence, and we owe it to each other to respect the right to creation history has granted us.\n\nTherefore, in defense of both Tolkien (whom some on this website have maligned) and Jackson (whom many have maligned), I forward that both are imaginative creators in their own right, with different and completely acceptable offerings to the world. Those who cannot tolerate either for \"mediocre writing\" or \"atrocious film-making\" should offer forth their literary or cinematic offspring instead of cunningly-worded diatribes of their deep dissatisfaction with all that does not conform to their inner reality. Then, we few who believe in and trust the creative ability of all will be able to see how those critical inner realities (so authoritative in exposition) match up with the rest of our perceptions.\n\nTolkien was an enormously talented, intelligent, and imaginative man, one whose stories, though unpolished by experience, still managed to attract a worldwide audience and devoted following with their luster. Jackson's movies took the sheen and inherent value of Tolkien's stories and placed it in a visual medium, a place where fans of LOTR could witness and love the events and people they held so dear. Of course Tolkien's story is imperfect; of course Jackson's movies aren't as full as we wish them to be. Their great successes are that they still manage to capture our imagination, to move us, to take genuine truth and isolate it in a world outside our ken, a place where we see ourselves better against a foreign backdrop. Both have created and done so masterfully, with the intuitive grasp that is termed \"genius.\" Tolkien would have had much at issue with Jackson's movies, where plot incongruities, lapsed character development, and visual splendor overshadow the philological and melancholic overtones of his book. Jackson admits he finds much at issue with Tolkien's book, including a lack of clear character motivation, extended and largely extraneous dialog, and heightened language not suited for Hollywood. But Tolkien, despite his perfectionist griping and loathing for any film version of his book, would respect Jackson for continuing the act of creation, for taking his modern-day mythology and spreading it to as many people as possible. Jackson has taken the beauty, the scope, the complexity, the richness, and the loss that permeate Middle-Earth and shared those leitmotifs with the world. Tolkien's characteristic \"niggling\" would have prevented any such attempt (even Jackson's), but in the end, his heritage lives on in beautifully conceived and executed films.\n\nI do not ask others to stifle their opinions of this movie or any other. Indeed, continue to express the direst and bleakest of your frustrations with the creative power of others, as it may lead you to actually do some creation yourself. Remember though, that the great evils of history, from Satan to Hitler to Sauron, are never capable of creation -- only twisting, mutilating, mocking, deforming, and misapplying. Be open to the vision of others and what they have to offer, especially when that offering comes in the virtuosic shape of Tolkien's writing or Jackon's movies. Look for the True in the Secondary and how it manifests itself everywhere once you recognize it.\n\nThis movie receives a 10 from me because it not only maintains incredible faithfulness to Tolkien's themes (and yes, events may deviate in completely separate and dissimilar media) but it asks intelligent viewers to look deeper into the circumstances of its own creation and beauty. From the loyalty of Sam and the weight of epic history to the sacrifice of Arwen and the never-completely-won nature of war, Jackson's movies capture the essence and heart of Tolkien's tale, with the benefit of the director's own imaginative fruit as well. The world owes Mr. Jackson its gratitude, as he has created another world and another reality that so many can, do, and will cherish.\n\nOne final word: There are few who would not rather be wandering in a far green country rather than dwelling in their own Circles of the World.Overall, I am disappointed, though not surprised, by the negative criticism of this movie. Indeed, this criticism exceeds the offering of alternative viewpoints and the expression of other cinematic possibilities and sinks into the realm of bitter invective. So many armchair critics are currently competing with avid Tolkien, Jackson, and movie fans alike in order to espouse the \"true\" value of Peter Jackson's landmark movie trilogy. For it is a landmark event in cinema history based on its sheer size and careful attention, praise and evisceration apart. The issue that greatly irritates me and pushes me to write is that many of the negative reviewers on this website have such limited room in their imagination that they cannot conceive of a world outside their own narrow framework. I find that a most sad reality in light of the legacy of Tolkien, Jackson, and all good story-tellers -- to create, to engender, and to nourish the growth of any and all imaginative ventures.",

There are so many great moments in this film: Frodo and Sam's interactions with Shelob, the giant spider; the battle of Pelennor fields, where Sauron's armies throw  everything from giant elephants known as Mumakil and the Witch King of Angmar at Gondor to destroy the world of men; and the final push to destroy the ring at mount doom. The Return of the King raps up a great story of bravery, love and proof that no matter how small or insignificant you think you are, you can change the world for the better.

            "content": "Lord of the Rings: Return of the King - is a spectacular achievement from an ambitious director. Peter Jackson saved the best for last in his rendition of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. He takes the stride and confidence of The Two Towers and amplifies it with more emotional weight, even more so than the Fellowship of the Ring. The impact is truly overwhelming. It's the final push that you make once you realize that you're out of breath, such can be said about this last outing. I can't stress enough the amount of caffeine you need to finish the 3hrs and a half epic, not because you'll be bored of it but due to the amount of stimulation and jaw dropping moments, you realize then how much straining it does to your eyes and mouth. \n\nThe battle of Minas Tirith alone, is enough to demand your attention. All points in the trilogy leads to this battle, a melting pot of the saga if you must. The majestic white city that surrounds a cliff point peak is so surreal and beautiful to behold that one will be surprised of its production. Not a single shot of this city screams false. The siege of the castle itself is glorious; competing catapults from both parties - damaging towers, damaging siege towers, a flying rock against running soldiers, desegregating everything to rubble that of which tumble on the civilians and soldiers below. Then comes the dragons that pierce through the air with a screeching sound, managing to fright, grab and drop soldiers off to their impending doom. We get a burning battering ram, armed trolls, siege towers, etc. The Rohan horses also adds a nice human touch. One feels the charge when they start stampeding all of their evil enemies. If this is all just too overwhelming, we get treated with even more and more scenarios, all of which are bigger than the last and all at the same battlefield. Don't fret however, we do get quiet and nuance moments throughout the battle; the scene when Gandalf talks to Pinpin about death being just another passage that \"we all must take\" is poetic and timely. There's a moment that I must not spoil involving the series beloved female character, Eowyn , whom after witnessing her beloved fall, fights with the Witch King and his dragon. One of the most crowd-pleasing moments this series has offered.  \n\nThe rest of the film carries along just fine. We experience the psychological burden of Frodo's quest and Samwise comes to fruition as Frodo's bodyguard/friend. There's even a scene where he carries Frodo up the mountain. Poignant and powerful that scene was.  \n\nAt the end of it all, I'm glad that I've experienced a film like this. This is an experience that demands multiple viewings. Thank you Peter Jackson and to his massive team (including actors and actresses) that worked so hard to bring this story to life.",

            "content": "The Return of Inspiration\n\nFirstly, this is a review of the final third installment of the The Lord of The Rings trilogy. If you have not seen both The Fellowship of The Ring and The Two Towers, stop right now and go watch those, then come back and read this review. The Return of The King is not only a masterpiece but a historical landmark in the world of filmmaking. The Film was accredited with eleven Oscars, tying it with Titanic as the film with the Most Academy Awards for any film in history. Any typical fantasy depicting the theme of \"the greater good\" has historically been plagued with coming off as hoaky or cringeworthy at best. This story has earned its place as one of the greatest allegories of greater good vs evil because of the various scenes showing mankind's struggle between good and evil. Remember, this is a story that follows imperfect people pushing for the greater good.\n\nAt the conclusion of the previous film we came to understand the overall theme in this story, that \"there is some good in this world.... and it's worth fighting for.\" This is important to keep in mind, because in the final film, shit is going to get out of hand. This is the first film where we meet Denethor, the Steward of The Kingdom of Gondor as well as Boromir and Faramir's Father. Denethor is a tragic character. Although he has good intentions, Denethor is unable to cope with the loss of his eldest son, Boromir. Being stricken with bitter grief and resentment, Denethor sends Faramir to a grim unnecessary and unwinnable battle. When he sees that Gondor is surrounded by enemies and that Rohan has not come to their aide, Denethor bellows to his people \"Flee for your lives!\" In the end, his fate is sealed when he abandons all hope completely.\n\nThen comes King Denethor's foil, King Theoden. Theoden and the Rohirrim look on the ensuing battle, there is a seemingly endless number of orcs in the valley below. Initially you can feel the shock and terror by the expressions of characters when they first see the great host. King Theoden imparts his courage to the Rohirrim as they exclaim \"Death!\" to their enemies. So as to say, \"We know this is where we die. Not only do we accept it. We will embrace it. We will not die in fear, we will fight until our last breath goes out like a candle in the wind.\" King Theoden, however is slain in battle by the Witch-King. Even though he failed to make it through the battle alive, he died with an air of contentment. He was worthy of remembrance and died with honor and glory. His final words show his readiness to die, \"I go now to my Fathers. In whose mighty company I shall not feel ashamed.\" These two characters contrast each other, showing us that holding onto hope can mean the difference between a miserable or a fulfilled life. \n\nLife and Death is one of the most compelling themes that this Movie serves to its viewers. There comes a point to where Pippin and Gandalf are awaiting the enemies to break down the gate where they're at. It's quiet. Pippin tearfully says, \"I didn't think it would end this way.\" But Gandalf, having experienced death himself is able to comfort the little Hobbit. He explains, that death is a path that everyone must experience but the journey doesn't end there. There will come a moment when we will see \"white shores and beyond. A far green country under a swift sunrise.\" Pippin is relieved and smiles, saying \"Well, that doesn't sound so bad.\" Gandalf's beautiful words motivate us to embrace death simply as the next great journey.\n\nThe absolute best moment of this entire trilogy comes when Frodo and Sam are climbing Mount Doom and Frodo's body has gotten so fatigued that he can't go on any longer. Sam tries to comfort him with memories of home. Frodo is so broken at this point that he reveals he doesn't recall the taste of food, the feel of grass on his feet or even the feel of the wind on his face. Sam is the very embodiment of goodness here. He cries \"Then let us be rid of it! Come on Mr. Frodo! I can't carry it for you! But I can carry you!\" Sam throws Frodo over his shoulder and carries him up the mountain. But even the best of moments can fail as moments later Frodo would betray Sam. As Frodo contemplates throwing the ring into the fire, his will is finally broken and he succumbs to the Ring. After everything that has been sacrificed for this cause, Frodo chooses to keep the ring for himself.\n\nIn conclusion, this film is more than meets the eye. Historically it has become the very movie that officially launched \"nerd\" culture into the mainstream. This is the least hoaky or phony film that I am aware of. The way it was written, shot, directed, composed and acted has made a lasting effect on audiences around the world and on myself. The resulting effect on me has been the deep desire to be faithful and hold onto hope of the good in life. In the end, this film has earned its place among the greatest films in history and absolutely earned every single last award it won.",

I think he will be the most underrated, at least his performance. Not sure I can say anything else except, I didn't like the last two as much as the first, but they're still so well done and extremely great, especially when you realize they came out every year, that they are still something for other movies to reckon with. I don't know how anyone could think Star Wars, Star Trek, etc are BETTER than The Lord of the Rings. (Not sure if I need to say this, but I will. I'm talking about franchises, not trilogies, as well as franchises as a whole, not just a part (trilogy) of a franchise.)",

The story is very strong for the first half of the movie, but as things progress, the CGI takes over and the battle sequences just get silly. The plot itself does move away a little from the original text towards the end, but it is quite understandable why certain parts was not filmed. Plus, there a moments that you think the the films has ended, and then it carries on which does get quite annoying the third time it happens as things just begin to drag on. In the end, the Lord Of The Rings trilogy is an amazing piece of cinema that will remain a classic piece of work, but I will always feel that this entry is nowhere as strong as the proceeding two, which is a shame for the finale.",

Even though I had seen these movies before, I felt like I had once again gone on the epic journey with Frodo and the rest of the fellowship. And the end both brought excitement and a heavy longing to my heart.\n\nFirst things first - I can now say with hindsight that The Two Towers is the slump of the trilogy. And that's not to say it's anywhere near a bad film - it just feels like the slowest and least exciting in comparison. When I first saw these films I had become fatigued by the end of Return of the King, but upon this viewing, it actually invigorated me with energy (and that's including an extra 30 minutes of the extended scenes)!\n\nMary and Pippen have so much more to do and so much more development in this one. And it brings a further depth to the ensemble of characters. Frodo coming to the last torturous moments of his journey really amp up the suspense and emotional level of his and Sam's trek. And the gigantic battle in Gondor is handled with better pacing and more exciting spectacles in my honest opinion. There is an over all feeling of less meandering as everything builds up and finally falls to a close.\n\nI laughed, I grew silent with sadness, I jokingly made fun of the \"multiple endings\" - I did and felt it all while watching this. And not for one moment did I get bored or lose interest. Throughout the 4 hours I was filled with complete cinematic and fantasy joy.\n\nAnd so, as Aragorn was crowned and spoke his final lines to the Hobbits I was filled with an extra ounce of happiness - because these films, do indeed, bow to no one.",

Winner of 11 Oscars, including a much-deserved Academy Award for Best Picture, it tied \"Ben-Hur\" and \"Titanic\" for the most Oscars won by a single film and holds the record for biggest sweep in Oscar history. The film's sheer epic spectacle is unmatchable for a film of this scale. Outstanding performances by the cast, including Elijah Wood as Frodo who is struggling more and more with resisting the One Ring, and we can feel his pain with how far he's gone since his homeland. Sean Astin, once again, doesn't cease to amaze me with his amazing performance as Sam Gamgee, whose loyalty and courage to support his friend to the end is unsurpassed by even superhero sidekicks in comic books. Andy Serkis shines again as the monstrous Gollum who gives into his lust for the Ring. The battle of Pelennor Fields is done as incredibly epic and spectacular as any of the world's greatest war films. Howard Shore's Oscar-winning score in this sequel as incredible as the past two films and his and Annie Lennox's Oscar-winning song \"Into the West\" is one of the best and most heartwarming ballads I've heard in film. Peter Jackson outdid himself with his trilogy and his final film shows how passionate he was about his work of bringing JRR Tolkien's books to life like never before. Even if the film's over three hours long, not one minute is unenjoyable. One of the best films I've ever seen and one the best films in history.",

This movie has been criticized for having a lot of endings. Even though I felt breathless by the end I really can not think of a better ending because a movie of this scope was always going to have a long ending to tie all the knots, this is so the characters complete their character arcs, in Aragorn's case being king, in Frodo's and Bilbo's case finally getting themselves rid of the ring and thus starting a new life and in Sam's case not being afraid and shy anymore. The emotional climax in this movie is when Aragorn is crowned king and he tells the hobbits that they bow to no one and everyone else bows to them and it almost,ALMOST had me in tears. I'll give this movie and the trilogy as a whole 5/5. The trilogy as a whole is my second favorite movie of all time.",

            "content": "And thus we reach the inevitable third instalment of one of the greatest trilogies ever made. Third instalments have a strange legacy. Barring a precious few, the third in a series is often the weakest link. Alien, Spiderman, even the Godfather, these series have a great original, an equally amazing sequel and then an underwhelming threequel. Yes, that's a word. And after the mighty previous two in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, no one could have blamed cinemagoers for expecting the worst when buying their tickets for The Return of the King. But it takes all of 30 seconds to realise that tradition does not apply here.\u00a0\n\nAfter embarking on his mission in the first film, Frodo is now closer than ever to his goal of destroying the One Ring in Mordor. His companion/life partner Sam and their guide Gollum are endeavouring to help him get there but Sam's suspicion of Gollum continues to grow. Gandalf takes Pippin to Gondor with a message for the steward and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli ride with Theoden to join forces with Gondor to fight Sauron's armies.\u00a0\n\nBy now the characters are well worn grooves for their actors and each of them fit into them perfectly. Even Elijah Wood whose character, despite being the principal, has the least to do dramatically, manages to maintain a fantastically restrained performance which, whilst lacklustre for the most part, fits his character to a tee. Other have more to do such as Viggo Mortensen whose character is struggling with the notion of becoming king and Sean Astin whose friend likes his new friend better than him. Despite initial disappointment about the double-act of Merry and Pippin being broken up, the separate journeys they each take allow their characters to find a new steel and reach new depths of emotion. The other double-act of the series is still alive and well, however, as Legolas and Gimli try to out-do each other in battle, drinking and general shenanigans. Ian McKellen stands out as always, showing that Gandalf may not have everything under control for the first time since Moria. All around the cast perform admirably, giving their all in every circumstance which adds to the immersive experience created by their director.\u00a0\n\nFans may have been worried that there was nowhere else for Peter Jackson to go. After covering the exquisite cinematography side in Fellowship and the sweeping epic side in Towers, what else was there to do? A lot, it seems, as Jackson pulls out all the stops to create an epic film which focusses as much on the intricacies of battle as it does on the grandeur of the surrounds. Every shot counts and every moment matters under Jackson's keen eye, whether its a slow motion montage or a terrifyingly tense encounter with a giant spider, Peter Jackson seems to have an instinctive feel for Tolkien's work in terms of mood and tone. He blends comedy with tragedy and tension with sentiment with a deft touch which makes you think that he wrote the thing himself.\u00a0\n\nHoward Shore once again brings the thunder as he continues and expands his incredible score. It's hard to imagine the Battle of Pelennor Fields without his amazing soundtrack backing it up. In fact, some moments, such as Faramir's ill-fated attack, rest completely on the emotional stirrings of Mr. Shore and he comes through in spades.\u00a0\n\nThe screenplay is just as versatile as ever, weaving deftly between sentiment and comedy without becoming stagnant or unnecessary. The restraint of the screenplays has been a trademark of the entire series, resisting the urge to spell everything out for the audience, rather letting them figure it out for themselves. It steers well clear of becoming overly preachy as well, as a film with this sort of content can become as well as staying away from an overdose of fantastical phrases which could turn away the less fantasy inclined viewers.\u00a0\n\nIt's impossible to write this review without mentioning the source material. Tolkien's epic tale was written nearly fifty years ago yet it is still able to captivate readers to this very day. Adults and children alike have been captivated by its fantasy world and the mythology behind it and, most importantly, without it we would never have these amazing films.\u00a0\n\nDefining Scene:\u00a0\nThe Rohirrim ride on Pelennor Fields. Gets me every time.",

            "content": "Review In A Nutshell:\n\nOne hell of a film! The Lord of the Rings has concluded with The Return of the King, an epic scaled film filled with battles and drama that many franchises fail to deliver. I want to simply get this out of the way before moving on to this review, The Return of the King is not a better crafted film than The Fellowship of the Ring; it may display its elements at a much grander scale, it does not carry the same power that the initial film was able to deliver. Despite from what I have just said, this is a majestic film that leaves audiences a feeling of both physical and emotional satisfaction.\n\nThe Return of the King follows the events of The Two Towers; Isengard has fallen, Rohan and Helm's Deep was defended, and the two hobbits (Frodo and Sam) have reached closer to the land of Mordor where they will destroy the ring. The previous film handled three storylines in such an unsatisfying and distracting way, constant cutting back and forth between each story too frequently, but The Return of the King manages to tell its multiple stories with improved precision, letting each one linger enough for the audience to completely engage themselves in and transition at the perfect emotional point. It was because of this that I was able to care so much more for the characters, the new set of characters that appeared in the previous film have now grown on me and created a sense of weight on me, which I feel whenever they are endangered during battle. For a long and expansive film, it manages to not let itself feel complicated to sit through, challenging audiences through emotions rather than intellectually (which is not really necessary for a film of this type) through immense character development and previously established themes. The film brings the audience back to the level depth that was found in the first film, reaching out for the internal troubles that carry with Frodo; how the Ring has continuously and gradually affected him, which would all come together by the end, where the film shows the emotional and psychological aftermath of his personal journey.\n\nThe battle scenes in this film are gloriously large and abundant, featuring top notch special and practical effects that lets audiences be drawn into its world; escaping our troubled reality for another that is equally fantastical and emotionally moving. The defence of Gondor was the best out of all the battles in the film, it shows Jackson at his most peak when it comes to handling visual effects, showing just how ambitious, dedicated and talented he is as a filmmaker. His influences of epic filmmaking is certainly in full display here, taking homage to them without coming off as a thief; obvious examples of these homages are George Lucas' Empire Strikes Back and Mel Gibson's Braveheart. Similar to Lucas' Return of the Jedi, Return of the King is an epic film; it isn't the thrill and warm action-drama blend of the first film, and it is not the dark and story building mixture of the second film; this is a film that is all about the much larger picture, the climax that we have all been waiting for, ensuring that even the smallest of scenes would remain with the epic atmosphere that is demanded.\n\nThe film's score, composed by Howard Shore, reaches beyond of what is expected; it creates a sense of excitement that never at all feels overbearing, and it creates emotional impact that never feels manipulative. It has the power to keep our skin activated with goose bumps for an extended period of time, primarily held by the grandness of the score. It keeps our mind and body constantly locked to what is shown on screen, regardless if what is being shown is uneventful. During the end of the film, we find a scene where Aragorn has been titled as King and he approaches the hobbits in the crowd; the hobbits initially bow to him, but instead he tells them \"You bow to one\", then he bows along with everyone behind him to the four hobbits. The scene alone can choke one up, but the addition of Shore's score, it conjured up tears in my eyes, simply waiting to fall; one of the rare instances where I display this sort of emotion.\n\nThe performance from its cast is wonderful as expected, particularly during its ending, where the characters are acting with subtlety, forcing to use their emotional range as a performer rather than their physicality. I do not need to dwell into the performances, because honestly it is just as great as the previous two films and to break it down here in this review would be futile.\n\nThe Return of the King is a satisfying conclusion to an amazing trilogy. It has surpassed anything its audiences, even the hardcore fans of the novels, have ever expected. The trilogy's influence can be felt in almost all of the films that have followed it and for a film to have that power is deserving of a high spot in the history of cinema's greatest triumphs!",

            "content": "After two break taking installments, 2003 was the year when Frodo\u00b4s journey to destroy the Ring got to an end thus supposedly ending Middle Earth\u00b4s story. \"The Return of the King\" become the most profitable installment of the trilogy and also earned 11 Oscars, tying \"Titanic\" and \"Ben-Hur\" for the most earned Oscars, including Best Film. Is \"Return of the King\" the best installment of the series? \nAfter the end of \"The Two Towers\", the majority of the Fellowship reunites until Gandalf learns that Sauron is planning to unleash his Orc army in Minas Tirith, capital of Gondor, thus beginning the final battle for Middle-Earth\u00b4s fate. Meanwhile, Frodo, Sam and Gollum are on the final segments of their journey to Mordor but Gollum's intentions may no longer be to help his master fulfill his quest. \nBy the end of \"The Two Towers\", audiences expectations were higher than ever  for a epic and worthy finale to this beloved and long story and thankfully, this final chapter succeeded in that aspect. By this point, it's redundant to mention all the greatness that Jackson archived with this trilogy (you can read about them in my reviews of the last installments) but still \"The Return of the King\" has some new elements worth to be mention: It counts with numerous well made battle sequences, some characters managed to still count with some character development and Jackson used the 3hr runtime wisely (excluding that 20 minute Epilogue) thus my problem with the pacing goes away mainly because the film is either focused on gigantic battle sequences or the intriguing relationship between Frodo, Sam and Gollum. Even if \"Return of the King\" gets a lot of things right and is an epic ending to this beloved trilogy, I believe that in comparison this is the weakest film of the trilogy mainly because of two reasons: 1) Excluding the Frodo, Sam and Gollum storyline, this film had almost no story, \"The Two Towers\" pretty much ended the rest of the story in a clever way and now the rest of the Fellowship is in the middle of numerous battles which are a distraction for both Sauron and the audience at times. 2)  After the third act is over, at about the 3 hr mark, this film gives us 20 minutes of Epilogue with the now famous \"8 endings\" when they are not necessary at all other than providing some fan service to lovers of the source material. I know that people had ton of emotion when they saw those endings but for a movie they really drag and I believed that if Jackson had ended this film at the 3 hr mark it would have make \"The Return of the King\" an even better film, I know that every single fan of the source material will disagree with me because they want to see those happy moments after battling for the fate of Middle-Earth but that's my opinion as a non Tolkien fan. \n\"The Return of the King\" is a fantastic ending to a fantastic story but unfortunately drags a little with that last 20 minutes. If you are a diehard lover of Tolkien\u00b4s work you will adore this final chapter no matter what. One of the best third/final installments of all time and one of the best fantasy films ever made.",

The cinematography is as charming as its predecessor, which segregated parts of the story taking place at a few different place of Middle-Earth are systematically broken down into chronologically inter-related events. While the setting of the Middle-Earth gets abruptly darker as Frodo and Sam set foot into the evil realm of Mordor, hope still prevails across the land of Men as Gondor and Rohan join forces to fight one last battle with the Orcs. In conclusion, the third part of the story relishes on the courage of Men and celebrates the ever resilient spirit of perseverance and bravery while facing tough times.",

What sets this movie apart from the others is the finality of it all. Yes, there are 3 or 4 end scenes in the last 20 minutes, but I look at that as a celebration of the accomplishments of this series. Not only is this movie solid from beginning to end, but it has some of my favorite moments in cinema history (SPOILER WARNING): the shot of Aragorn leading the undead army into battle, Faramir's troops charging into battle with Pippen singing in the background, and, of course, \"You bow to no one.\" If you haven't seen LOTR, you're doing yourself a disservice!",

Far too often in the LOTR series I think the story builds up these great idea's or characters and them lets me down whenever something big is supposed to happen.\nFor example: The Ring Wraiths.  Great name...great design..great backstory and they do a good job of showing how afraid of them everyone was.\n\noh...let me put it out there that I never read the books and I think any discussion of the books is irrelevant since I'm watching a movie and that's what I'll judge it by. Back to the wraiths..\n\nI LOVED these guys and couldn't wait to seem them flex their muscle (or bone).  In the first movie, a big wave in the river washed them away.  In retrospect it wasn't even all that impressive.  I'll call that a flawed execution of the idea (water will get rid of them).  There was a scene where they came upon the hobbit in a derelict tower and I don't remember anything cool about (I need to rewatch these films I agree..it's just I've never been interested enough to spend that much time again).  ANd finally at the end of the film during the big battle scene it looks like we're going to get to see them do something really cool and what happens? He gets killed before he ever does anything cool. \n\nGandalf?  HAH!  I love the idea of the most powerful wizard and he certainly looks the part but aside from one scene where he was swinging his stick what giant magical things did he do?!  He made his staff into a giant flashlight.  That's it! I waited hours upon hours to see him make a big flahslight?!  Huge let down!   Yes the Balrog was cool and he has a great line in the scene but we don't get to really see what makes him so magical.  \n\nI've got more but I'm sure no one will read this.\n\nI want to add that I am shocked by how much I absolutely love the 2 new Hobbit movies (Hobbit and Desolation of Smaug).  Hell..I give those films 5 stars.  Love them and I can easily say that I think Desolation of Smaug is the best of all these films.",

            "content": "Favorite film of all time, even beating out the Godfather Parts 1 & 2. Everything about it is pulchritudinous and the story is phenomenal. The dilemmas the story brings about seems archetypal but hey, it's in the world of Middle Earth. The characters, especially Aragorn, Gollum and even Sam, were perfect. The complexities that lie within them were portrayed... perfectly (sounds redundant right?). The bounds of friendship, duty and what it means to live upon a world you care for were explored beautifully in this film. Even though I preach peace instead of war, the war scenes in this film is just jaw dropping and amazing. I wanted to be part of it and reminded me it's worth it to fight for the world you love. On other terms, a lot of people say the film is too long with an ending that seems to be relentless. You have to look at the films as whole and see it as a celebrated achievement and how everything comes down to. It's a film that come to full circle as the story finally ends. The Lesnie's cinematography and Howard Shore's music sweep you away into this fantastic place and hell, it did it's job. Even the side stories along with the two main story arcs were integrated well and even packed a punch.\n\nI have to go more in depth with the characters and story because this film deserves its merit and praise. Peter Jackson did an amazing job making these numerous characters valid and memorable characters. Each one of them has depth and contribute to film in a dynamic manner. The character of Aragorn stole the show in my perspective. Viggo Mortensen sold that role of the mix of a Jesus figure, prodigal son/ King Arthur vibe. He was damaged and he came back to the throne, not for the power. He came with the intention to unite men again a danger that would threaten their way of life and the world they love. Even the characters that were dicks were memorable. I love Bernard Hill's Theoden. He was one that redeemed himself when it counted. His speech was memorable and the way it was filmed and captured in the screen was purely breathtaking. I love how the story tackles every aspect of life without feeling like it was being shoved in our faces. Of course some stories are more valid than others but it should be that way. But, it gave enough to us to where it satisfies to that perfect degree. It's the perfect overall film, that encompasses everything.\n\nThe only gripe I had about the film but was resolved in the extended edition was a few scenes that were left out in the theatrical release. The first one was Saruman's demise. That scene flowed well with the narrative and I'm pretty sure the audience would have been okay to see the Saruman issue resolve the way it should have been. The way he die was symbolic and fulfilling. The theatrical has him locked in his tower forever but the big gap of that is how in the hell would the Palantir be in the water if Saruman is locked in the tower. Another one was that Peter Jackson chose to omit the scene with the mouth of Sauron. The scene had the emotional weight and gave Aragorn and the men of the West (with one elf, dwarf, wizard and two hobbits) more of a reason to take on the army. It justifies them going all out taking out as many of Sauron's forces. I understand why Jackson kept it out so it is simpler to have them buy more time for Frodo but the gap is that Aragorn and Gandalf do not know that. It would've made sense seeing the mouth of Sauron bring the armor of Frodo out and say the hobbit is dead. Either than that, everything is perfect.\n\nPeter Jackson created not just a film, but a grand art in itself. I can't think of any film that did what the Return of the King did in its standard. Looking back upon Citizen Kane, Ben- Hur and like I said the Godfather, it did everything better and set upon a new standard for film for generations to come.",

            "content": "\"Prepare for battle!\"\n\nIt's very rare when a third chapter, especially the finale chapter of a film franchise, raises my spirits up. Previously, my favorite final chapter film was Return of the Jedi, but with JJ Abrams and Disney working on a new trilogy, Return of the Jedi is not the last film anymore. Now my favorite final chapter is the final chapter in the LOTR trilogy, The Return of the King, a finale that truly raises the bar in creating epic adventure movies.\n\nAs Frodo (Elijah Wood), Sam (Sean Astin), and Gollum (Andy Serkis) are closer and closer to Mordor to destroy the One Ring, the Ring begins to take a heavy toll on Frodo, making it really difficult for Frodo to trust his companions, especially Sam, who's still suspicious of Gollum's part in the journey. Also in Middle-earth, the Battle for Middle-earth begins, and Aragorn (Viggo Mortenson), with an extremely outnumbered army, leads the ultimate battle to defeat Saruron's armies and reclaim the throne of Gondor.\n\nAlso appearing in this great film is Ian McKellen as Gandalf, Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd as Merry and Pippin, Orlando Bloom as Legolas, John Rhys-Davies as Gimli, Bernard Hill as King Th\u00e9oden, Hugo Weaving as Elrond, Liv Tyler as Arwen, Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, Miranda Otto as Eowyn, Karl Urban as Eomer, David Wenham as Faramir, Ian Holm in a small role as Bilbo, and John Noble as Denethor, Boromir/Faramir's father and the Steward of Gondor.\n\nYou'd think that with a franchise like LOTR, something this bog would fizzle out after the first installment. But Peter Jackson, an extremely dedicated director who's the most obsessed fan of Tolkien's source material that I've heard of, creates the ultimate finale, creating, according to film critic Peter Travers, \"a film epic in which all future epics will be judged.\" I strongly believe that there hasn't been an epic this epic since William Wyler stunned us with that glorius chariot race in Ben-Hur and David Lean's excellent cinematography-filled wonder in Lawrence of Arabia. \n\nI've said it before, and I'll say it again; Middle-earth is one of the most fantastic worlds ever created in film history. With the new Hobbit trilogy already confirming this fact, it's safe to say that the stunning New Zealand locations will be hard to top when creating incredible and fantastic worlds in cinema. From the stunning cinematic shots of the green grass to the dark and murky world of Mordor, Middle-earth has never been the same. The best cinematography in the whole trilogy; nuff said.\n\nWhile my favorite battle sequence in the trilogy is Helm's Deep in The Two Towers, the action sequences here are still mind blowing, with the huge standout being the Battle of Minis Tirith and the Pellinor Fields. The sequence is at least 30 to 40 minutes long, and with each passing minute, I'm stunned. I don't think any other film director can match intense, epic battle sequences as incredible as what Peter Jackson has pulled off here. Other strong sequences are Sam's fight with a creepy-looking CGI spider named Shelob and the climatic showdown on Mount Doom alongside Aragon's battle at the Black Gate. \n\nWhat succeeds more than these already excellent battle sequences is the story. As with the RT consensus, it's \"emotionally powerful.\" The characters are developed at the highest level, to the point where we root for the good characters in the movie, especially Frodo, Sam, and Aragorn. Some have complained over the multiple endings explaining the fates of the characters, but as for me, I was still impressed. I wanted to find out what happened to these great characters, and they're endings were handled perfectly well, maybe even making some cry in the case of a certain number.\n\nHelping make Return of the King the already incredible experience it is is the acting. I'm not going to write a lengthy paragraph about how great each actor/actress is here, I'll just they that each one involved did a truly fantastic job and creates that emotionally powerful finale that should not be missed. Standouts here include Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortenson, Bernard Hill, Miranda Otto, John Noble as the mad steward, and especially, Andy Serkis as Gollum. What surprises me the most about this is that no actor didn't receive an Oscar nomination when the film literally won about every other award in the book, including Best Picture. I could picture Viggo and Serkis receiving Best Supporting Actor nominations at least. The Academy can be really stupid sometimes...\n\nAnd last, Howard Shore's score for this excellent final chapter is Shore at his all-time best. Shore uses the great themes present in the first two that were already fantastic and scores a heavily, emotionally satisfying score that's one of the best scores I've heard in the past decade or so. I'm also impressed by the closing song by Annie Lennox, \"Into the West\", one of the most moving songs I've ever heard in my life. Music plays a huge part in handling this phenomenal final chapter, and Shore's music definitely doesn't disappoint here.  \n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Return, simply put, is the greatest final chapter ever made in a film franchise, better than Back to the Future III, better than Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2, and better than The Dark Knight Rises. Peter Jackson proves he's definitely the filmmaking genius here, with some visually excellent battle sequences, an emotionally powerful story, and compelling acting and characters. Even with The Hobbit films (which are still great even if they're not up to LOTR standards), there's no doubt in my mind that Peter Jackson will be the modern George Lucas when it comes to wowing us at state-of-the-art visuals and excellent stories. I'm really stunned here!\n\n\"Send these foul creatures back into the abyss!\"",

The story is so touching and I the first time I saw this movie I started to cry. The Lord of the Rings trilogy is much about us humans as it is about evil; it shows us that we can live together even though we are different. The extended edition of The Return of the King got much more logical things than the original, even though it's almost 4,5 hours long. The CGI are in fact in my opinion greater than in The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers, but there are some vague practical effects, but I don't really care because the movie is awesome! The ending in The Return of the King is in level with The Dark Knight Rises and Inception; it's spectacular as it is touching. I totally cried in the ending. It's extremely hard to illustrate my feelings about The Return of the King, because that would only result in an emotional response.\n\nThis movie is both dramatic and spectacular.\n\nThe Return of the King gets a 10/10.",

            "content": "*THE OFFICIAL BETTER THAN JUNO SEAL*\n\nI honestly have no clue why so many people love dungeons and dragons, and the Middle Ages.  They're so lame and corny that it makes Drake seem cool.  I mean seriously, these films suck.  Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the King is an adaptation of J.R.R Tolkien's book of the same name.  While I have tried countless of times to read it, I just couldn't get into it.  It seems rather bland.  So, nearly 50 years since the books release, King of the Bronies, Peter Jackson, hath claimeth the mantle to create the film.  I've tried watching these films countless of times, but I always fall asleep.  Not because they're boring.....Well, they are very tedious.  But mainly cause I start the film at 9pm and it goes well beyond my time limit.  I'm not doing this on purpose, but I just forget to watch it until it's pretty late.  So I watched it fully.  It was bad, very bad.\n\nFirst off, I won't discount the special effects, costume, or set design.  The reason being is that.....well, it's amazing.  It feels like a true dungeon and dragons film.  Unfortunately, this film is weighed down by some hilarious dialogue.  \"One does not simply walk into Morador\" being probably the cheesiest of them all.  Seriously, at some point, you'll feel like you're watching a bunch of seriously handsome nerds role playing.  People say the adventure was the greatest thing about this film, but they're wrong.  If I were to watch people walking across a mountain or lake or grassland, I'd watch one of those Discovery channel \"Meet the Buzamboo tribe of Africa\" specials.  I'm watching a movie, and I'd prefer if there was more to it than walking and a small burst of fights.  \n\nSeriously, this could have been one of the best movies ever made. That's right, I'm saying it is not. Even the casual movie fan (movie fan, not one of the mindless herd) has to admit that he/she can sense the fear in the producer's hearts behind every scene in this movie. They took a great risk in making an expensive trilogy like this, and they did not want to get the short end of the stick. The result is a compromise; a combination of good effects and good acting counterpointed with unnecessary cheeze-ball action and, well, bad acting. The result is a bizarre movie with brilliant scenes followed by terrible scenes.\n\nElijah Wood. I had trouble at first putting a description to his particular form of bad acting. I came up with the phrase, \"blank acting\", because he always has that one blank look on his face. You know the one, and the example that comes to mind is the look on his face in the scene where the ring \"accidentally falls through the air and lands directly over his finger\". A friend of mine found a review that had a better description than mine: \"What he does is not acting, it is face-making, and anyone can do it\".\n\nOverall, it's a beautiful film to look at.  The sets, CGI, and some of the acting (particularly Sean Bean as the tragic knight) were pretty nice.  Unfortunately, there is a stupid script with some horrible acting (Elijah Wood as the Frodo)  It was a daring move.  You know, adapting a beloved book series (which I couldn't read), but I'm just not a dungeons and dragons type of guy.  I mean, I can understand some of the love it gets, but it's not my cup of tea.  It may be a technical beast, but it's also emotionally shallow and empty.\n\n2.5/10",

            "content": "Providing fans with the emotional last chapters of their heroes' stories - iced over with perhaps the most impressive battle sequences ever put to film - Peter Jackson does no more than deliver the epic masterpiece that was expected of him.  Fair enough, the continuous endings are a little annoying after a while.  But in my opinion, they were deftly handled and sealed the movie perfectly.  The idiots that complain about the ending sequences are probably the same idiots that complain about Harry Potter doing the direct opposite.  The movie is very long, but anything shorter would have been a crime.  Although just like the other movies, it isn't entirely without its flaws.  Again, Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas, just get a little too far-fetched in their warrior perfections.  I also think the whole story with Merry becoming a soldier was all but wasted, serving little importance to what the rest of the script projected, and so was basically an unnecessary add-on, just to remind us that he still existed.  Conversely, however, I really like the emphasis the film makes on Pippin and Galdalf's friendship, and although the drama-triangle between Frodo, Sam, and Gollum, does have its low points in forced, comedic distractions, their final plight with the giant spider and Sam's heroic return is incredibly satisfying.  Basically, there's too many good and bad points to list here, so I won't bother trying.  It basically comes down to whether you're a fan of the series.  If you are, then 'Return Of The King' is yet another fantastic movie, based on a fantastic book, and since these films never sacrificed character and spirit for sheer, ground-breaking spectacle, one can easily invest themselves into its grand-scale story of good triumphing over evil, and the enduring quality of friendship, so as to ignore its minor downfalls, and love it for the brilliance it really is.",

This finale features the best visual moments of the trilogy (and that is saying something), the CGI, locations, sets, and models all blend seamlessly together. Somehow after 20 years this movie looks better than anything released today. What makes it so spectacular is that the massive, world shaking moments never for a moment cause the narrative to waiver. The attention to the characters that we've come to love is at the forefront of even the biggest spectacles. The last 40 minutes bring the emotions out like you wouldn't believe. Seeing beloved characters reunite and then finally part ways leaves audiences emotionally wrecked, regardless of how many times you've seen it. Return of the King will leave you exhausted and satisfied, and even after 4 hours (if watching extended) you still won't quite want it to end.",

Obviously because they were adapted from one of the quintessential fantasy novels. I was completely blown away by all three films. Everything was done right in these films. Fantastic acting by people I thought wouldn't do well. Attention to detail. Amazing soundtrack. Characters you care about. Emotional and fighting scenes well balanced. Im probably one of the last people to actually watch this and I wish I saw it sooner. I have nothing but praise for these films  do I'll stop here.

I actually watched the movie twice, and at the end of the second time I watched it, the whole audience still gave a standing ovation after all these weeks of showing. It's really just THAT good. Great directing, great editing, great script, superb acting and wonderful score. Although the movie was long, it was worth every minute as no scene seems to be a filler. From the defeat of Isengard all the way to sending Frodo to the Undying Lands, Return of the King is simply a 3 hour and 21 minute masterpiece.

Be prepared for a lot of intense plot to come right at you. It's full, but it's all full of good stuff. \n\nBy this point, we've met all the important characters (although John Noble as Denethor is a character I love to hate). This allows for us to get right to the plot, and it moves swiftly, but not so fast as to ignore context or the emotional weight of the movie's events. \n\nAfter all the grand battles and desperate climbs up Mount Doom, the movie does give you time to relax and let go. It seems to end in several places, only to cut to voiceover narration, and yet another scene. I love hearing what happens, but don't tease us, Peter Jackson! That said, the ending is very sweet and emotional, bringing even the toughest football players to sniffles. \n\nAn epic end to an epic franchise. \n\nEXTENDED VERSION: Extended is right! This version is a solid four hours long, with a lot of extra material in the first act. It's good stuff, giving us more insight into Aragorn's journey through the Land of the Dead, and some great extra battle scenes at the Pelennor Fields",

The character development and alternate scenes of the battles made you feel like you were watching a completely different film. The visuals on this trilogy were fantastic that it made me a fan of New Zealand Landscapes, which by the way, occupies my desktop and mobile wallpapers.\n\nPeter Jackson has done a phenomenal job at translating the books into the next trilogy that has been competing quite well with THE trilogies of all trilogies; Star Wars Episodes IV, V and VI. This is a film that will do you well to learn the in and outs of if you're a student of filmmaking.\n\nReturn Of The King has done a great job at wrapping up the trilogy in a sweet little package. The battle at Pelennor Fields was just amazing both story wise and visually. Frodo's breakdown was told beautifully.",

            "content": "The story begins with a reminder of how the hobbit Smeagol came to possess the Ring of Power, D\u00e9agol killing his friend who had found it in the bottom of a river (where he lost many years before, as seen in the first film, when some orcs killed Isildur, who had cut his finger on the Site Sauron Barad-dur, which ended the War of the Last Alliance, and had kept the ring despite the warnings of Elrond). From then continues the story where it left as Gollum leads Frodo and Sam through the entrance near Minas Morgul, where they see their armies from the war.\nAfter the victory in the Battle of Helm's Deep, a company of soldiers of Rohan, with Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Th\u00e9oden and \u00c9omer went to Isengard, Saruman's citadel from which the attack had left. The found completely destroyed by the Ents, and returned to reunite with Merry and Pippin. Among the ruins of the city, Pippin found Saruman's palantir, Gandalf quickly took custody (in the extended version DVD, there is a deleted scene showing Saruman and Grima. Gandalf breaks Saruman's staff and King Theoden Grima invited back to Rohan. Saruman Grima mocks, and this, full of anger, take a dagger he had hidden and kills him. Legolas mistakenly shoots an arrow that falls to Grima and both die. Sees Saruman falling from the terrace of the tower and when it hits the ground you drop the Palantir that had hidden. then finds Pippin).\nAfter the victory celebrations, Pippin was very curious to see again the stone and Gandalf took her from her sleep. He saw in it the eye of Sauron, who tried to get information from him, but Gandalf was able to act quickly, without revealing anything substantial Pippin. Pippin, however, they came to see something important: a white tree. The Wizard understood that it was the White Tree of Minas Tirith, which meant that Sauron was planning to attack Minas Tirith. Gandalf left immediately to warn, and Pippin was also to protect the city. But when he arrived he found the Steward Denethor II saddened by the death of his favorite son, Boromir, and completely indifferent to everything else. Feeling partly responsible, since Boromir died defending, Pippin offers his services to Denethor as a soldier. Also, distrusts Denethor Gandalf as he knows that comes accompanying Aragorn, who must regain his throne as heir of Isildur, which would mean the overthrow of Denethor, who reproaches Gandalf who wants to use a shield against Mordor attack then Aragorn take the throne. For all this Denethor refuses to follow the recommendation of Gandalf to ask for help from Rohan, but Gandalf decides to invoke the aid of Rohan and Pippin sends light the beacons of Minas Tirith. Aragorn noting the communication request for help Theoden, who despite having hesitated to intervene (as Gondor did not help in the Battle of Helm's Deep and Saruman in other attacks), finally decides to gather his army to go to war.\nRohan forces take a few days to gather his riders, before leaving for Minas Tirith; Theoden laments at not all subjects respond to the call and you will not have enough forces to defeat Mordor, but decided to continue the underway. Aragorn receives a mysterious visit Elrond: Arwen daughter saw a future that could have children with Aragorn and that the decided to stay in Middle Earth, so Elrond offered its help in the war reforging the great sword Narsil that had defeated Sauron at the time (the fragments of the sword that were preserved for centuries in Rivendell, were reforged into a new sword called Anduril, Flame of the West), and reminding you that gun Aragorn get military cooperation the dead (they had to fulfill a promise made to King Isildur). With this sword, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli leave the rest of the army of Rohan and became embroiled in a cave where dwells the army of the dead. These ghosts Isildur had promised help but it is not provided, so that after his victory over Sauron's cursed that even after death, they had no peace. Only if one day you paid your debt could. Aragorn claimed his aid, promising as King of Gondor to give your debt as discharged.\nGollum, meanwhile, having told Frodo that Sam wanted to keep the ring, for what he would ask to take it at some point, took the bread that was left, left crumbs on Sam's clothes and charged him having eaten everything . While repeatedly hitting Sam Gollum, Frodo and Sam suffers decompensation saw it, they offered to help with the Ring, Gollum and Frodo manages to make him suspicious of Sam and apart from your trip, just as it did enter the pass of Cirith- Ungol and Shelob den. Still, managed to break free and attack Gollum. Gollum claimed to be innocent, that the Ring forced him to do what he did, and then told Frodo to what would eventually Mordor to destroy it. Gollum struck again, but fell into a ravine. Shelob Frodo caught after that, but was chased away by Sam. Sam thought Frodo was dead by the poison injected him and took the ring to continue the mission, but then came a few orcs. Sam hid, and orcs found and took the body of Frodo, who commented that he was not dead but only unconscious for several hours. Sam infiltrated his fortress and released, and continued their journey disguised as orcs.\nDenethor and Faramir sent on a mission to failure to retrieve a stronghold of Minas Tirith Osgiliath, previously conquered by orcs. Faramir suicide mission accepted this only by his desire to show his father that he was also a loyal and competent warrior, and hurt by her father open preference was always for Boromir. His group just returned alive, and was about to be annihilated by the nazgul, but for the help of Gandalf and Denethor to see his son wounded by several arrows mad, believing him dead. While the bulk of the Mordor forces advanced on the city, Denethor was with his son to burn alive at the stake. Gandalf was able to retire from the fire at Faramir, who was still alive, but Denethor was incinerated.\nMordor forces could hardly be contained, and the great battering ram Grond tore down the gates of the city. When his victory seemed near, appeared on the horizon the riders of Rohan, who returned to match the situation. Then Mordor was powerful reinforcements: an army of southerners (Haradrim) with war elephants, and with much effort got rid of some.\nThe battle seemed to lean in favor of the army of Theoden, but then this was mortally wounded by the Lord of the Nazgul, who ordered his flying creature that would feast on the flesh of the fallen king. Eowyn appeared to defend and was also defeated by the specter, which reminded him that no man could kill him. Merry Then came up behind him and plunged his dagger into the calf; Eowyn removed his helmet and revealed he was not a man but a woman, and immediately went through his face with his sword. The Witch-king finally disappeared, beaten not by a man but by a woman and a hobbit.\nThen there were also several Mordor pirate ships expected to dock in Osgilliath docks, but to the surprise of the orcs, those boats down Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, who had taken the approach. With them was the army of the dead, which wiped completely Pelennor Fields: all kinds of creatures that Mordor had led to war were pulverized in seconds.\nAfter the battle, the king of the dead Aragorn claimed his promise to free them. Gimli advised not to, Mordor was still a danger and they were very helpful, but Aragorn kept his promise and paid their debt considered. The spectra disappeared.\nGandalf said, during a discussion, to resist the attacks was useless since Mordor was much more powerful and ultimately prevail. His only hope was that Frodo had succeeded in destroying the Ring. The only way they could help was marching towards the Black Gate to keep Sauron's attention focused on them, and distracted from the presence of Frodo and the Ring in its own territory. All survivors marched to the Black Gate, where Sauron Aragorn demanded to surrender, but instead the doors opened and she appeared dark lord's army, and a sea of ??enemies surrounded them.\nFrodo and Sam finally reached Mount Doom, where Gollum reappears to retrieve the ring. But once at the edge where Frodo could pull the fire ring and destroy it finally succumbs to his power and claims it for himself. Gollum came then and although Frodo was invisible, I pulled over and rips your finger to remove the ring. Between them was disputed between the edge and fell for him. Frodo could grab the edge, but Gollum and the Ring fell into the flames and were destroyed. The tower collapsed Sauron, the big eye exploded Mordor sank into the ground and all the orcs fled.\nGandalf rescued Frodo and Sam of Orodruin (Mount Doom) riding on the back of Gwaihir, Lord of the Winds, and the hobbits were honored in Gondor during the coronation of Aragorn as king. Then they returned to the Shire, where Sam married Rosita. Frodo wrote his memoirs, leaving the end of the book Sam and finally sailed to the Undying Lands with Bilbo, Gandalf, Elrond, Galadriel and the elves remaining. The film ends with Sam's return home, where they await their daughter, Rosita and her little baby, after firing his friends at the Grey Havens. Sam says, \"Well.'m Back\", (words that also ended the novel), come together at home, and closes the door.",

That leaves like 25 minutes of movie so let's just say it's Frodo staring and close-ups of that Elvish guy. \n\nThe visuals are yet again stunning but after about 6 hours of them before this one even starts, the effect begins to wear off. It doesn't help that the majority of this one is CGI either- the realism fades the more it's used until it all just feels like a demo for a computer game- you don't even get to play it for yourself. The other films avoided that but this one is just animation overkill.\n\nFor me it's a disappointing conclusion to a trilogy that has such remarkable beauty throughout but also so many damaging flaws. Even though so many people must have put so much heart into it- it still feels heartless in comparison to the source material. Most action flicks are heartless but this one aims for more but sadly just doesn't make it.",

Con esta triolog\u00eda, Jackson se convierte para mi en uno de esos casos en los cuales no puedo decidirme a se\u00f1alar que es mejor, si el libro o las peliculas. Con sus notables diferencias, cada uno es capaz de atrapar a lectores y espectadores, haciendo olvidar las variaciones en la trama o los detalles perdidos. Es un cierre espectacular a las 2 peliculas anteriores. No por nada dicen que El Retorno del Rey fue el peor problema que pudo tener Geroge Lucas cuando quizo hacer la nueva trilogia de Star Wars, como alcanzar tan notable resultado? Como es logico, esta es la pelicula que se llevo el reconocimiento de todos los premios (12 oscar, por ejemplo), eso que no compitio en ninguna categoria de actuacion por motivos logicos. La musica de Howard Shore son verdaderas sinfonias en tiempos modernos No puede faltar. 100% recomendable.",

And while he must deal with Gollum / Smeagol, Frodo what most want is help Smeagol / Gollum, but what he wants is to kill Frodo and his loyal friend Sam and get the Ring / Precious for himself, attracting both Hobbits to a deadly trap closer to Mordor, where all that is evil lives. And Aragorn must accept his destiny as the true King of Middle Earth and fight the last war that will change everything, the greatest army of all is together to destroy the human kingdon. \nA film full of love, tension and a great battle between good and evil, which will arrest you, even if you have not seen the other movies.",

It has been called the number 1 movie in 2003. Today it is still one of the top rated movies ever!

Overall though the movie is highly acclaimed and many critics and audiences alike loved it!\n\nPlot Summary-\nBeing the third and final film, the film hits the ground running. Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Theoden King and Gandalf arrive at Isengard. They find that the Ents, Merry and Pippin, have taken over and destroyed Isengard. All Gandalf needs to do is get the information he needs for Saurman the White, who is hiding in a tower at Isengard. After exchanging a few word with Saurman, his servant Wormtongue comes up behind his and stabs him. Saurman then falls off the tower and falls on a spike and dies. Pippin sees that Saruman dropped a fortune ball looking thing. He goes and picks it up and almost immediately Gandalf comes and takes it from him. That night, Pippin does a few things, that makes Gandalf take him to Minas Tirith. Then the king of Rohan decides that if Minas Tirith calls for help, they will answer. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas decide to take the Paths of Death to attempt to get the help of a ghost army. Then, Merry rides to war with the Rohan army, only to be dropped of at Helms Deep. While all of this is happening Frodo, Gollum and Sam are slowly making their way to Mount Doom. There is a betrayal and one member of the group is left behind. The other two have a fatal encounter with a giant spider named Shelob. Will Frodo destroy the ring? Will Aragorn take his rightful place as king? What will happen to Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas on the paths of death? What happens with Merry and Pippin? Watch the movie and you will find out!!!\n\n\nAwards won\nIn the 76th annual Academy Awards, Lord of the Rings, Return of the King was nominated for 11 oscars! In the end Return of the King won every award it was nominated for!!! It won Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Original Score, Best Original Song, Best Sound Mixing, Best Art Direction, Best Makeup, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing and Best Visual Effects. Overall the trilogy itself had won a total of 13 oscars!!! And I feel like they deserved each and everyone of them! The movie has amazing special effects, amazing music and amazing acting. The movie itself is just a amazing work of so many amazing people! They all worked their butts off to make sure the movie came together and came together wonderfully. So yes I do believe the film deserved the Oscars it won, I even believe that it should have won more.\n\nThemes\nReturn of the King has many themes, but the main theme is that a little person could make a BIG difference. Frodo and Sam are these little people that lived in a perfect happy little place. Then Frodo is given the duty to go and take the Ring of Power to Mount Doom. Merry and Pippin manage to become soldiers and help fight Mordor's armies. These little people aka Hobbits manage to many things that older and bigger people couldn't do! Through out the movie they are underestimated, but they just keep doing bigger and bigger things. Sure they are not the smartest or the biggest, but all the Hobbits manage to do amazing things\n\nTechnical Elements\nThis movie is probably half special effects and awesome battle sequences, which makes the movie even better! Where do I start? Well there is a pretty epic battle sequence that takes place at Mina's Tirith. They animated 10,000s orcs to represent Mordor's armies. Then there is a incident that involves flying heads and rocks, so all that was CGI and animation. Also there is a incident that involves a giant spider named Shelob, so the fight was her was almost all CGI, but it looked pretty real. I could go on forever describing all the special effects, but I'll move on. The overall look of the film was really cool, it looked neat and real. I think the fact that almost all the landscape was real helped the movie look even better. The music like always was beautiful, it caught the tension and all the emotions of the story. Without the music the movie probably would have not been as good as it was. Return of the King would be almost nothing without the technical effects, but because of them the movie is the best it could ever be.\n\nOverall opinion\nI ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! This movie will always be on the top of my list. I'm a HUGE Lord of the Rings fan and this movie made me very happy. It followed the book pretty well, except a few points, but I won't get into that. The movie is just the epic conclusion of a original and fantastic story. I feel like there is no way to make it better! I would recommend this book to any one who loves Lord of the Rings, for it doesn't disappoint. Also any one that wants a original and different story, because that is exactly what Return of the King is. Anyone that enjoys fantasy full of dragons, wizards and elves, I think would definitely enjoy this movie. Overall I think very highly of the movie and it will always have a special place on my heart. \n\n-MD, 8th Grade Student",

            "content": "The Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King (2003)\n\nRating: ? Stars or 86/100 (86%) *SPOILERS*\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is the epic, sleek, and long final installment of Peter Jackson's LOTR film trilogy. Since The Return of the King's blockbuster debut in theatres, way back in 2003. Jackson's collection has grown and swelled into one of the greatest trilogies ever created in the film industry. The only trilogies that may have Lord of the Rings beat are The Godfather, The Matrix Trilogy, The Dark Knight Trilogy, and the original Star Wars films (for sure). \n\nIn the beginning, the film somewhat drags on... and on, and on, and on... The first 45 minutes to an hour is nothing but flashbacks, visions, and waking up in a cold sweat from bad nightmares. I understand that it is all used for setting up the final 2 hours of the film, but some casual fans may have nodded off in the beginning.\n\nHowever, the film's action and awe sparking moments starts seemingly out of nowhere and last until the movie's final minute. Aragorn, with the company of his fellow side kicks Legolas and Gimli, enter a mountain to request the aid of a brigaide of dead warriors seeking redemption and following orders from the King of Gondor himself, Aragorn. Soon after, Smeagol convinces Frodo that Sam is after the ring, which is confusing because the most obvious thing in the entire movie is how in love Sam is with Frodo. Bromance x100. Anyways, shortly after, Smeagol tricks Frodo into entering a cave on the way to Mt. Doom in Mordor. Frodo soon realizes that a large spider inhabits the cave. After a struggle, Frodo escapes the cave and tosses Smeagol off a cliff in a skirmish. Continuing, the spider trails close behind and sticks Frodo with her poison gland. Then this giant ass spider wraps his ass up in a good country mile of spider web, only to flee due to Sam's return and heroics with his erection.. err-ehm, I mean sword. Then, the battle that the past three films has been leading to takes place for a solid hour, hour and a half, being led by Gandalf the White and at LEAST a quarter million horses. The battle is epic to say the least. \n\nBy The Return Of The King, I am sick and tired of hearing and seeing Pippin and Charlie from LOST's little hobbit ass. \n\nIn the end, Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King satisfies without reaching too far and trying to accommodate the expectations.",

What Jackson has done, is make movies so epic that even people who havnt read the books can be drawn in to a fantasy world that is so amazing and created with such scale, you cant help but be amazed. The conclusion to the trilogy is the best of the three spectacular movies. the battle sequences are the greatest ever committed to film, and the story finds its conclusion. One of the best movies ever. Anyone want to disagree? And you need good reason.",

The film picks up right where Two Towers left off with Sauron planning his first attack on Middle-Earth to try and conquer it. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam are being led by Gollum/Smeagol to Mordor in order to destroy the ring without realizing that Gollum has a secret plan to get it for himself. Like most finales to film series, most of the characters have already been developed and a majority of the film turns into a bunch of action sequences to create closure in the series. However, despite the action sequences, the opening is the dullest part of the film. Other than the interesting scenes with Gollum (including how he got the ring in the beginning of the film), nothing much really happens other than preparing for battle and it takes way too long. Nevertheless, once the action scenes actually started to happen, I completely forgot about the drab opening and was fixated all the way to the end. Once again, Gollum is the star of this film. The way Andy Serkis portrays him is just off the walls good. Also working for the film was the action sequences. There were moments that were exhilarating and so exciting that I had a huge grin on my face. I also dug the climax of the film which had to be the best part of the movie. Once all the action dies down, the story starts to slow down again. There were many scenes that they could've removed, but I didn't really mind because I was really enjoying the aftermath scenes. Overall, if you liked the first two Lord of the Rings films, you will not be disappointed with this magnificent conclusion to an astounding trilogy.",

From the outstanding scenery, to the amazing visual effects, this film does deserve the many Oscars it won (which I believe broke a record for most awards won). Peter Jackson is a genius, who manages to keep the audience entertained the whole way through! Not only is the crew fantastic, but it is the actors who make the film complete, and add so much more to this film. It has been a great journey watching these three films, and I hope Peter Jackson continues to make magic on the silver screen for many years to come. I can't wait to see The Hobbit now!",

            "content": "The return of the king is a nice ending to a beautiful trilogy, wining eleven Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director, this movie is just too good an ending and if you are watching this trilogy, just look forward to the ending where you get to see, the ring destroyed (in the most unbelievable twist, that is if you have not read the book) and Aragon rise to the throne that he was meant to be upon.\nHere is what The Fellowship of the Ring movie was heading to, an ending that will remain the minds of movie watchers for years to come.\n\nThe movie has a massive number of visual effect shots that triple and double that of The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers respectively, these shots can be seen clearly as the movie nears the end with the battles at Rohan which were quite filled with many CGI implementations and look forward to when Aragon goes searching for new recruits, there you will another set of visual effects\n\nThe film and the novel differ so much but that doesn\u00e2(TM)t deter the film from its professionalism in the master art of storytelling, from the hand of Peter Jackson. The movie show cases an intense directorial work, which you just have to be impressed about. The actors were just charming but in this movie three people stole the show, Elijah Woods (Frodo Baggins), Sean Astin (Samwise Gamgee) and Viggo Mortensen (Aragon).\n\nThe movie tale continues from where Two Towers left up, Frodo and Sam are nearing Mordo and getting close to destroying the ring of power. The other members of the fellowship (which have united by the end of The Two Towers) went out to save Gondor from the hands of Sauron\u00e2(TM)s army, the battle at Minas Tirith.\n\nAs all this is going on, Elrond (Hugo Weaving, Agent Smith from the Matrix and V from V for Vendetta in 2005) approaches Aragon and tells him, the only way he can win this fight to save Gondor is if he wills the sword Anduril and claim that, which he has been running from; claim his Kingship. \nHence the name of the film/novel \u00e2The Return of the King\u00e2?\n\nMaking over a billion dollars from the box office, The Return of the King, sold more tickets than its previous two counterparts. Although The Fellowship of the Ring is considered by most to be the best of the three, this movie ranks second.\n\nAfter you are done reading this, it is not complete yet till you go and get the DVD Extended version box set of The Lord of the Rings and make sure you get the novels also.\n\nThe Oscar wins for the movie at the 76th Academy Awards in 2004 were: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Original Score, Best Original Song, Best Visual Effects, Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, Best Make-up, Best Sound Mixing and Best Film Editing. \n\nwww.lagsreviews.com",

Like the first one there is an issue with length (not as much though) it could have benefited slightly with some time shaved off. But that's a very small issue, the different character stories all happening at the same time - it could've been too overbearing but there's breathing room and each character is making clear progress. There's also more back story to 'Gollum' and how he first came into contact with the ring. There's also a more of a psychological edge to the third film with a battle of wills carrying greater importance this time.\r\n\r\nUnsurprisingly visually it's great again - some of the green screen stuff is a tad rough. The action is intense and frequent as well as 3 huge battles that open the scale of the world yet again. Acting is great again with 'Serkis' and 'Astin' being the stand out two carrying the film to a satisfying ending.\r\n\r\n'Return of the King' concludes the trilogy is fantastic style there's a larger psychological edge this time around and yet again memorable battles and scenes.

Late appearances by Cate Blanchette and Ian Holm as Lady Galadriel and Bilbo Baggins respectively were also welcome.\n\nThis is very much a film that knows how to tug on the heartstrings. The friendship shown by Astin's Samwise Gamgee towards Wood's struggling Frodo Baggins, particularly after the betrayal by Gollum, kept the audiences emotions high for the finale, when the surviving Fellowship - Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and Gandalf - storm the black gate of Mordor ahead of the rest of the army, showing the strength of friendship.\n\nThat makes it all the more heartbreaking when the Fellowship splits, not through disaster, but by the same method that any friendship group splits - through time.\n\nAs reunions and farewells come and go alarmingly rapidly towards the end, the emotion is kept high right until the end.\n\nAnother scene which to me added to the emotion was the appearance of the Eagles to deter the Nazgul from their pursuit of Frodo and the Ring. It holds to me the same sort of emotion that the appearance of the Hammerhead Rhinocerous in James Cameron's Avatar has in the final battle - Nature fighting back. I've always been partial to that.\n\nI could go on forever, but the basic gist is that this is a fantastic film. And a satisfying conclusion to an amazing trilogy.",

            "content": "I'm going to come right out and say it, The Return of the King is the best conclusion to a trilogy I have ever seen. The movie is literally overflowing with content. Full of equal amounts of action and drama, Peter Jackson absolutely nails it! He is somehow able to handle dozens of characters and multiple plot-lines. And unlike the second movie, he balances everything perfectly.\r\n\r\nThe journey is taking its toll on Frodo and Sam. Even if they rid themselves of the One Ring, and make it back to the Shire, they will never be the same. With no clear way to get into Mordor, Gollum suggests they use a secret tunnel he knows of. He is actually tricking them; in this tunnel is Shelob, a giant spider. Gollum plans let Shelob kill Frodo and then take back his \"Precious\". Meanwhile, a crucial battle for Middle Earth is about to be waged. But Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas need help. They venture into the Paths of the Dead to recruit an army. Sauron's army lays siege on man's last hope, Minas Tirith. Frodo escapes Shelob and presses on towards the fires of Mount Doom.\r\n\r\nI cannot praise the story, direction, and acting in this movie enough. Starting with the acting. Elijah Wood, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Andy Serkis, and Ian McKellen all give phenomenal performances. All of these actors are able to bring their characters story arcs to a satisfying end. Of course they are helped out by some wonderful writing, but the actor's performances cannot be taken for granted. The supporting cast members also hit all the emotional marks. Of special note are Orlando Bloom, Miranda Otto, Bernard Hill, and Liv Tyler.\r\n\r\nBut none of this would have been possible without the steady hand of Peter Jackson. How he is able to hold it all together and give us an Oscar winning movie us almost inconceivable. It's very common for the third movie in a franchise to be the worst. And almost always, if it had two great movies coming before it, the third movie will disappoint. But I honestly can't think of anything disappointing about this movie. The level of excellence that Jackson was able to maintain throughout this trilogy is staggering.\r\n\r\nThe movie is 200 minutes long. But somehow there is always something happening. There are never any dry moments. The action is intense and frequent. Jackson gives us the scale required for this to be a satisfying conclusion, but still keeps the action character driven.\r\n\r\nEverything in this movie is executed to perfection. And The Return of the King has 11 Oscar wins to prove it. There is a bit of controversy about the ending. Did Peter Jackson really need half an hour after the action ends to tie up the loose ends? I'd say absolutely. With such a long ending, the audience doesn't feel like it's been shorted in any way. And Jackson pulls it all off flawlessly. The entire movie is so emotionally powerful. When I saw this movie for the first time about 2 years ago, I cried at the end. That was the first time I had cried during a movie in a very long time, and I haven't since then. That's how powerful the ending was for me. This movie and the entire trilogy hold a special place in my heart. Flawless!\r\n\r\n\"My friends, you bow to no one.\" 10/10",

It's based off the third book from Tolkien and is my personal favorite.  It's filled with more stunning visuals and great effects.  There's a good amount of action as well including a nice final battle scene.  The script is smart and wraps up all the different storylines nicely.  I loved the opening scene which gives us a light on Gollum's backstory.  I thought the bromances between Frodoa and Sam and merry and Pippin are a bit passionate, but what happens in the shire, stays in the shire.  When I first saw the film in theatres I had to drain my dragon badly and kept getting tricked by the ending scenes.  These final scenes are glorious and ends the three film epic in a grand fashion.  Peter Jackson did a great job all around through the trilogy as Director.  The top notch cast reprises their roles including Elijah Wood, Ian McKellan, Viggo Mortensen, Liv Tyler, Sean Astin, Orlando Bloom and of course Andy Serkis as Gollum, my favorite character.  This time around, the film won eleven Oscars including Best Picture.  While it's a looong journey, The Lord Of The Rings: Return Of The King is one of the best third parts to one of the greatest trilogies in film.\r\n\r\nGets A-List Rating of: A-List Approved!     \r\n\r\nyoutube: youtube.com/Wesida515\r\nfacebook: facebook.com/Westroopalist\r\ntwitter: @WesAlist",

ROTK had so many copy-paste-battles it was easier to spot the \"photoshops\".\n\na little side-rant: I've heard people calling \"The Hobbit\" is like a video game. everything Legolas does looks like a \"video game\" it makes super mario feel like gritty realism.",

T^T  We love you!  ...There's nothing that's awesome about this movie that isn't awesome about the book -- aside from almost perfect casting and stunning visuals, and near-perfect execution all the way down to voices and oliphants! As with the Two Towers, Frodo is the main setback, being emo and whiny about having volunteered and leaving all his heroic qualities that made him man up in the first place back in the books and in the Fellowship of the Ring. Aragorn seems to have left some of his own self-confidence back in the pages of Tolkien but makes up for it in an otherwise great representation and command of the screen and delivers a riveting speech - I was ready to go die fighting Mordor to buy time for furry-footed halflings. Gandalf is the shit as always - it's not his fault that we don't understand why he didn't just call in the eagles to *get* the hobbits there, or why he didn't use his crazy awesome powers sooner to help in the fight - that's Tolkien's fault.  Gimli and Legolas are on-point as always and ready at just the right times with some comic relief.  Elrond still looks perma-angry, and who can blame him when some mortal's after his daughter, Mr. Anderson? I'm disappointed that more time wasn't spent on character development and less time on a seemingly endless run from point to point so we can fight over the ring some more like has dominated the flow of the last 2 movies - but action junkies must be catered to I suppose. Other than that and Frodo's whininess this movie is epic - like the book it's based on. Not perfect, but so close to perfect that you might not notice.",

The Godfather trilogy, the original Star Wars trilogy, the Spider-Man trilogy etc. I kept my expectations low going into this movie because the third film of every trilogy usually disappoints me. After I walked out of this movie I could only think one thing. This is not only the best LOTOR film, but also one of the greatest masterpieces ever put on film! The scale is larger than the other two LOTOR films, the battles were just as large, long and epic, and every character is done justice in the script and with the performances of the amazing cast. Notable characters that I enjoyed watching were Andy Serkins as Gollum, and Elijah Woods as Frodo. Every scene with these two characters were extremely well done! Gollum was already suspenseful  as a character, but Frodo really shines! The burden of carrying the ring really changes Frodo from the Hobbit we met in Fellowship. He has grown as a character and I really love how Elijah Woods portrayed him! Once again this film is an ensemble cast, and every character has their own moment to shine. There is a reason why this film won eleven oscars, and that is because it is one of the finest films of this era! I went into the theatres and sat through 4 hours! Yes this film is almost 4 hours long but you know what. I wished it were even longer than that! I am really going to miss the many adventures and battles that this trilogy has to offer, and I hope that everyone will enjoy this film as much as I did! Peter Jackson has created one of the greatest movie trilogies of all time! Thank you Peter Jackson, and all the cast and crew that were involved in this trilogy! You have created something truly special!",

In the third and final chapter in this amazing trilogy Frodo has almost completely finished his quest to destroy the one ring in Mordor. As he gets nearer to completing his quest war rages on. Aragorn, Samwise,Merry, Legolas, Gimli and Gandalf must fight off army's from Sauron.

I think it'd be a safe guess to say that the Academy probably felt that, given each of the three movies came out a year or less apart, it would probably be a bit unfairly premature to heap the customary awards on either of the previous films until the whole trilogy was completed, also because the trilogy really represents one story in three parts rather than three separate stories.  As for the film itself, I didn't find it as entertaining or emotionally satisfying as the previous two, between which I really don't have a favorite because I think both Fellowship of the Ring and Two Towers delivered about on-par with one another given that they had different things to bring to the saga.  The problem with this third entry is really in the adaptation because, even with its length, there is a lot of relevant story that had to be left out (or so I've heard) so no matter how long they draw it out, the ending ultimately feels a little abrupt.  Still, like its predecessors, it's a monumental achievement that, put with its predecessors, is worthy of the Tolkien name.",

While he stands out for me, all the other acting is almost equally as powerful and the character development is outstanding. The screenplay is clever and original and there is no reason why i would dislike this film in the slightest. Truly, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is the most powerful of the trilogy.",

Now with Lord of the Rings I like to view it as a Epic split into 3 parts. So if you haven't seen the previous two don't bother till you do. In this film we get the final stretch of our heroes journey. I can explain more but doing so will give away some the films amazing moments. This film brings everything home to an entirely satisfying conclusion. It's epic, intersting, funny, and mostly sad. The last hour will have you choking up. Peter Jackson masterfully keeps the tension throughout to film down to the last minute the conflict is resolved. The dialougue amazing. The music essential and entirely in sync with the film. Most of all it the story of friends, love, amd never giving up that really brings everything to life. 4 hrs is a little long in the tooth but you won't notice it. The great thing is these extended cuts really make everything much more better. Everyone does really well but special mention to Sean Astin who brings the film full circle.  This one of the biggest epics, best finale, and ultimatley best trilogy of all time. You would be wise to watch them. Even if you hate them and you'll thank me afterwards. I afterall got my sister to warch them and now she loves them!",

            "content": "Although I have seen all of the Lord of the Rings films before, I had never read the books, and so recently I decided to read them. I then thought it might be fun to watch each film as I complete each part of the story. And so, having finished \u00e2~The Return of the King\u00e2(TM) we come to the third and last of Peter Jackson\u00e2(TM)s films. For the record I have to say that I watched the extended version, available on DVD and Blu Ray.\n\nNOTE: There may be spoilers in here; if you haven\u00e2(TM)t seen the \u00e2~Fellowship of the Ring\u00e2(TM) and \u00e2~The Two Towers\u00e2(TM) please skip this paragraph.\n\nWe begin with some back-story on how Smeagol came across the ring; how it corrupted him and turned him into Gollum. Sam and Frodo are still on their way to destroy the ring and Gollum is still steering them along his chosen route into Mordor. A route that may work to his advantage. Meanwhile the rest of the fellowship is reunited briefly at Isengard before being split again when they ride to Rohan. They hear that Sauron\u00e2(TM)s forces are on the march and they intend to attack Minas Tirith, a city of Gondor. Gandalf takes Pippin directly there after he steals a look at Saruman\u00e2(TM)s \u00e2~seeing stone\u00e2(TM) which is linked directly to Sauron. Gathering their forces, King Theodin and Aragorn set off towards Minas Tirith, only for Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli to leave them and take another path there. Aragorn has had word that he must fulfil a pact made by his ancestor if they are to succeed at Minas Tirith. With the city under siege, all seems lost as Sam and Frodo are split asunder by the cunning wiles of Gollum. I think that\u00e2(TM)s enough to whet the appetite\u00e2\u00a6 for now.\n\nYet another epic film with tremendous scope; Peter Jackson and the many others that worked on this really did an excellent job! Yet again, the original music by Howard Shore is tremendous another great score with some really great themes, following on from the previous two films with great aplomb. As far as performances go, well everybody did a great job but those that stood out (for me) were; Elijah Wood as Frodo, Ian McKellen as Gandalf, Sean Astin as Samwise \u00e2~Sam\u00e2(TM) Gamgee, Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn and Bernard Hill as Theodin (King of Rohan). Also worthy of note were; John Noble as Denethor, Billy Boyd as Pippin, Dominic Monaghan as Merry, Orlando Bloom as Legolas, John Rhys-Davies as Gimli/Voice of Treebeard (briefly), Liv Tyler as Arwen, Miranda Otto as Eowyn, David Wenham as Faramir,  Christopher Lee as Saruman, Karl Urban as Eomer and not forgetting Andy Serkis as Gollum/Smeagol.\n\nThe book could very easily have been made into two films; there is such a lot that happens and so many twists in the plot that it might have benefitted if that were the case. But we\u00e2(TM)re not here to speculate I guess; although it does depart from the book in many respects, I did find that most of the important bases were covered. A film which has some tremendous scenes of epic battles but also some very tender and thought-provoking moments as well. For me the most powerful scene was where Denethor has sent his son, Faramir, to his doom and is eating a meal while Pippin sings a haunting ballad. The intercutting of the images of battle with Denethor and Pippin safe in Minas Tirith and the haunting melody over the top makes for a scene that has stayed with me since I first saw it back in 2003. I did find it did tend to drag a bit towards the end, but other than that a very fine film that is a fitting end to a great trilogy.\n\nSteelMonster\u00e2(TM)s verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.\n\nMy score: 9.4/10",

            "content": "The first time I saw this movie, I was turning 11, and I saw it for my birthday.  It was the first Lord of the Rings I saw in theaters.  When the movie I ended, I wanted to cry because LOTR was over.  And at 11 years old, I couldn't exactly realize how good of a note the trilogy ended on.\n\nThroughout the years, I've come to the conclusion:  'The Return of the King' is my favorite movie of all time.  Peter Jackson's finale to JRR Tolkien's famous books is the best ending I've ever witnessed to a series.  This movie hits everything on the point in all aspects.\n\nThe action is amazing in this movie.  From the Battle of Pelennor Fields to the final stand against Sauron, the action is breathtaking.  You can even include all of Sam's inspiring fight scenes and also Osgiliath.  There is a huge amount of action, but this action does not define this movie.  What does define this movie is the emotional acting.\n\nAmongst all of the praise and all of the awards this film garnered, the performance that stands out the most in this film is Sean Astin as Samwise Gamgee.  When people ask me who my favorite character is in LOTR?  I always answer Sam.  Why?  Because Sean Astin gives the most inspiring, emotional, and heartbreaking performance of the entire trilogy.  As the sidekick best friend of Frodo, Sam is the yin to Frodo's yang.  He is the sanity to Frodo's INsanity.  And he made me cry... multiple times.  As did Frodo.  Their chemistry and struggles are what make LOTR so special.  Their final struggle to the top of Mount Doom is what defines 'Return of the King'.  Their final act deserves a standing ovation.  \n\nLastly, Howard Shore's score is amazing.  Every piece during every scene truly puts out the emotion that is within the film.  The combination of all three movie scores is one of my favorites of all time.\n\nThis will ALWAYS be my favorite film of all time.  Always.  Because it is one of the few which hits every emotion in me and breaks my heart the second the screen goes black.  I don't care what anyone else says, because hell, in my opinion, this could possibly be one of the top five films of ALL TIME.",

            "content": "Return of the Jedi is the Lord of the Rings: Return of the King's cautionary tale. After the triumph of Empire Strikes Back, Return of Jedi failed to deliver on the promise of the second film in the Star Wars Trilogy. Fortunately, because of the minimal catharsis provided by the first two LOTR movies, LOTR: Return of the King adds emotional resolutions to the already fantastic locations and special effects promised from the first two LOTR movies. By upping the emotional ante, The Return of the King delivers the punch set up by the first two movies, and places the Lord of the Rings at the top of the Trilogy Pantheon. Peter Jackson has finished the fantasy genre's benchmark, in what will be one of the greatest motion pictures of all time. \r\n\r\nThe Return of the King returns us to our story slightly after the Two Towers Ended. After the victory at Helm's Deep, Gandalf (Ian McKellan) and the others turn their attention to Mordor and Sauron. After an accident, Gandalf and Pippin (Billy Boyd) travel to Minas Tirith, the capital of Gondor. There, the two encounter Faramir (David Wenham) and Denethor (John Noble), Faramir's father and the steward of Gondor. Most of the others are preparing for the great war with Sauron. Theoden (Bernard Hill), Eomer (Karl Urban), Eowyn (Miranda Otto), and Merry (Dominic Monaghan) are preparing Rohan's horses for battle. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) continues to assume his responsiblities as the heir to the throne of Gondor, and takes Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) to recruit, um, powerful allies. On the other end of the adventure, Frodo (Elijah Wood) is being carried by Sam (Sean Astin) and Gollum (Andy Serkis)to the secret entrance to Mordor; all the while Frodo becomes more wary of who he can trust as the ring's power grows.\r\n\r\nThe Battle of Helm's Deep was a truly unrivaled spectacle in The Two Towers, which makes is shocking that the Battle of Pelennor Fields surpasses it. For one, there are several new types of creatures added to the battle, including ghouls, oliphants, horses, multiple orc species, and flying dragons which are integrated seemlessly into the battle. Jackson elects to have different groups arrive at different times to sway the battle for good or for evil. Each new arrival packs a different type of punch as well as challenge for each side. The dragons elevate the third dimension to literally new heights, and Minas Tirith is a fascinating city complete with levels, which adds more tension every time a new level is breached. By adding little victories/defeats inside a greater battle, the Battle of Pelennor Fields generates multiple genuine character moments in the midst of the massive battle, thus making it the new standard for how a battle needs to appear onscreen. The combined effort of makeup, special effects, acting, cinematography, and directing have crafted a visual masterpiece.\r\n\r\nNot that the special effects were done. The best CGI spider I have ever seen appears halfway through the movie, equal parts terrifying and insurmountable. Gollum's rough spots have been ironed out, reinforcing the shock that he is not an actual creature. The Eye of Sauron is also an awe-inspiring spectacle. When couple with the first-rate makeup, art, and cinematography, LOTR: Return of the King is unmatched in terms of generating a feeling from an image, background, or musical score.\r\n\r\nWhat elevates the Return of the King over its predecessors is the long-awaited resoultions for every character and the manifestation of themes set up over the course of two epic movies. Themes like female equality, inner salvation, true friendship, embracing your destiny, and even the smallest creature can change the course of the future all receive varying levels of payoff throughout the Return of the King. The character evolution finally sees the end: Aragorn becomes a strong leader that others are willing to follow even into hopeless situations, Sam becomes Frodo's fierce bodyguard gardener, and Merry and Pippin get to prove their worth to the battle. Each little victory widens the smile of the audience bigger and bigger. \r\n\r\nLots of the credit goes to the tapestry of actors, who get to shine brightest in the Return of the King. Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Elijah Wood, and Ian McKellan generate very complex emotions and several scenes of payoff for all the time we have spent with them, but the big standout is Andy Serkis. His Gollum is such a fully realized character: in one scene he can be viewed with pity, awe, anger, and mysetery with one simple evolving stare. Although LOTR is a team effort, Serkis is the star. All of the other actors add the right amount of emotion to each of their characters, as much a credit to the writing as it is to the actors. \r\n\r\nNew Line Cinema took a huge gamble on the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. They let Jackson film all three movies at the same time, and invested enough to bankrupt the company if it flopped. Fortunately for New Line, the investment paid for itself and then some. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is a culmination of the vision of JRR Tolkien and Peter Jackson and the efforts of several hundred actors, writers, and workers. These people of Middle Earth can rest easy knowing they created the first great Trilogy of the new milennium, as well as the first Oscar-winning fantasy picture. The Lord of the Rings proudly stands alongside some of the greatest movies ever created. Once \"The End\" flashed across the screen, I experienced a euphoria I have never experienced since, and might never experience again.",

            "content": "It's been a really long while since I had seen this trilogy. Going back to Middle Earth was as enjoyable as was the first time I saw this at the movies, when I was on my early teens.\n\nI've seen all the extended versions these last two days and I've opted to review the \"trilogy\" as a single movie, because in the end, that's what it really is.\n\nTo take on the gargantuan task of adapting Tolkien's work is just a mindblowing concept. It takes someone with a frickin ginormous pair of nuts to even dare to approach such books. I'm not a HUGE fan of the books, but I enjoyed them fair enough, so taking the elephant out of the room right now, this is a movie based on a book. It's not the book. If it was the \"book\" it would loose the purpose and would be downright impossible, so things had to be taken out, introduced and done on a different way. What's more important is how you do the approach to the source material, and Jackson and his crew do exacly what it should: the message of unity amongst diverse people, with different ideals, different creeds, how someone so little can achieve something so big, the ecologic message, the love for all things man can do of good, etc etc is all here, all proud and glorious. And obviously the main story and quest don't diverse that much from the original book trilogy.\n\nThe screenplay is sharp and very very ambitious, for it tackles so many genres that it could turn into a huge festival of random happenings but it's fortunently focused and it all feels consistent. There's comedy, love stories, warfare, adventure all over and even dowringht chilly horror and atmospheric moments. I really appreciate people who can blend so many approaches altogether, without loosing focus on the essential. There are flaws though, sometimes sequences are a bit repetitive and happen a bit too often and the dialogues can come as corny and cheesy to almost unbearable levels at times but it's passable and pretty much all of the actors deliver really well the difficult tasks they had at hand.\n\nOne thing that accompanies the script really well is the superb cinematography. Not just the gorgeous shots of New Zeland but how many moods are created on all situations with fantastic lighting, brilliant set designs, lively costumes and a good blend of CGI landscapes with natural environments. Middle Earth feels alive and no character feels out of place in it. Some things haven't quite endured the test of time. Studio lighting sometimes comes way off on character's faces on CGI heavy sequencies, it's evident the chroma used on some scenes and sometimes the mix of natural light and digital on both real actors and digital creatures creates a very distracting mix. \nThe CGI is superb after all this time, specially when the creatures are still. They have tons of details on their expressions and are all very well design. But when things get moving.... boy, things get hairy now 10 years later. It's all too blurry, feels unnatural and you can spot for miles what is animated and what's not, creating a very messy blend. Nevertheless, at the time this was made, I was in complete awe, but nothing like having something livelier, characterized in front of you, but hey, given the creatures you see that would be just impossible, no?\n\nSoundtrack is memorable, I was humming the tunes all the time, for I remembered them all this time later and helps the audience to indentify where they're at and with whom.\n\nGoing into more detail would be painful on such a huge movie with so many ideas, genres, characters, action set pieces, etc. But this is indeed a masterpiece of recent times and changed many things. Not only is this a nearly flawless technical ride, way ahead of it's time when introducing on how Gollum came to be and with many other inovations on the FX department, but it also never forgot having heart, soul, giving every character the attention it deserves, respecting the source material, getting across a universal message for all ages and for all creeds, leaving a huge smile on your face with contempt. This is cinema. When you get out of a movie theatre and have learned something or felt something that makes you a richer person, being 10 or 80 years old, then the filmmakers have completed their goals. And LOTR has plenty for everyone and even spare for the naysayers.",

Tolkein's classic fantasy of the War of the Ring and last battle of Middle-Earth is a story that gripped me from the first days that I began reading \"The Hobbit\" in 6th grade.\r\n\r\nPeter Jackson, also a life-long fanatic of the books simply took the imagery of his imagination and transferred it onto the big screen in what I believe to be the greatest adventure/fantasy film EVER created.\r\n\r\nThe rich texture of the film and the precise attention to every detail of the story, right down to the sets, costumes, armory, even the way the actors portrayed the characters were as close to perfection as I have ever witnessed in a film.\r\n\r\nWinner of ELEVEN 2004 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, the accolades were really a testament to the achievement in cinematic history that all three \"Lord of the Rings\" films encapsulates.\r\n\r\nThey are NOT to be missed!\r\n\r\nAll three movies are Rated \"PG-13\" for intense epic battle sequences and frightening images.",

The Return of the King might very well be one of the best movies ever made. This movie is 4 hours long, yet every second of it is riveting and emotionally brutal. There are few movies that can make me cheer, cry, and scream so many times. This movie is filled with emotionally devastating scenes as well as universally empowering scenes that make this the most emotionally demanding movie I have ever seen. It deserved every one of it's nominated and won Oscars. The acting is truly incredible as is the cinematography and effects. The scale of this movie, in my opinion, has yet to be beaten by any movie. This movie builds so incredibly up to one of the greatest second halves of any movie ever made. Basically, Disc 2 of the Extended Edition is the most chaotic film experience any human being can have. It is empowering, devastating, and you are literally biting your nails with intensity in the movies climactic scenes. There are so many scenes in this movie alone that would make my \"favorite scenes in movie history\" list. It is amazing in every right, and is one of my favorite movies of all time, as well as being a filmmaking masterpiece alongside it's predecessors. 10/10",
