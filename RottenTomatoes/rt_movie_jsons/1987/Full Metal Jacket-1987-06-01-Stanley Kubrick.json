    "summary": "Stanley Kubrick's take on the Vietnam War follows smart-aleck Private Davis (Matthew Modine), quickly christened \"Joker\" by his foul-mouthed drill sergeant (R. Lee Ermey), and pudgy Private Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio), nicknamed \"Gomer Pyle,\" as they endure the rigors of basic training. Though Pyle takes a frightening detour, Joker graduates to the Marine Corps and is sent to Vietnam as a journalist, covering -- and eventually participating in -- the bloody Battle of Hué.",

Kubrick masterfully tells two stories in one film; one of the dehumanization soldiers go through, and one of the realities of war, and it's the shocking speed at which these two stories flow into each other that makes the viewer also realize that a boot camp is far from the real thing. Amazing sets, some quality cinematography and great acting pull it all together. Sure, this movie doesn't do anything new or have a very interesting message, but it's rock solid all around otherwise.",

The screenplay was really good and i have nothing to add to that. Its not really my kinda movie, but i really appreciate the filmmaking behind this whole movie, because it is mind blowing for 1987.

Sometimes it was also really bad, the soldiers would just drop dead when shot at long ranges. The actors seemed as if they just tripped over nothing and fell to the ground. If more attention was put into acting the movie would've been much better, but it was good for the year it was made.\nOverall I think that the film was okay. There were some parts I enjoyed and some I found to be quite boring. I understand that the movie is from 1987 which was a different time, but it's just not for me. I thought as for the quality that it was directed pretty nicely, but the music was lacking at times when it could've made the scenes more intense. I would recommend the movie to younger viewers because it's nice to be educated on what happens at times of war. I would give the movie a 3 out of 5 because the drama didn't have the type of effect on me that I thought they were aiming for. I did think that the movie was well directed, but more music to increase dramatic effects would've given it a higher score.",

            "content": "The acting was one element that stood out to me because the sergeant who was instructing them was quite harsh. Joker constantly curses all the time, and I wouldn't be able to keep a straight face if he said anything else, just like Pyle couldn't stop laughing. I was already laughing at the beginning of the film since I had never heard a sergeant in a movie cuss someone very harsh. I was surprised that they had no prior experience with marine corps training, yet all of the trainees in the video acted as if they were genuinely training to go to war. My overall reaction to the film is that it's incredibly entertaining, but there's a lot of violence in it that I can't tolerate because I don't usually watch violence films. I'm giving this movie four stars out of five since it's a fantastic film with the only drawback being the violence throughout the conflict. I couldn't bear the thought of someone being shot and fighting for their life. So, a tiger warning for those who don't enjoy watching violent movies.  The first half of the film is definitely my favorite since it's really fun to see them struggle and the sergeant always cursing them out to hurry up. While the second part of the film is still full of action and violence, which I dislike, it was still fantastic. The film's quality was excellent, and it was well-made. Even though it was produced in the 1900s, the graphics were excellent. The story's plot was also beautifully written and easily understandable.",

It made it shows what boot camp was like because not everyone experiences it and showed a unique take on the Vietnam War. The acting was very entertaining and the movie shares a message. \nOverall the movie was very entertaining in the beginning but my liking started to drift away and I started to find it boring but that was probably because I was distracted. The beginning of the movie showing basic training was funny because of the characters. I do recommend this movie to anyone interested in wars or specifically the Vietnam War. The movie was great in the first half than in the second. I would give this movie a 3.5/5.",

A Clockwork Orange? The Shining? None of them. The true greatest work of art by Stanley Kubrick is Full Metal Jacket. His take on the Vietnam War gives us a joker (Matthew Modine) and his life in the military during the Vietnam War. To start things off, the film's acting is spectacular. The performances from Matthew Modine, Vincent D'Onofrio, and especially R. Lee Ermey are all fantastic. R. Lee Ermey especially simply because he does a great job and gives us a memorable performance as the no nonsense drill sergeant. The music throughout the entire film fits the Vietnam War theme. Last but not least, the cinematography is nuanced throughout the entire film especially during the film's climax. Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket is intense, artistic, and even darkly comedic. The way Stanley Kubrick made the film is so perfect.",

The movie did get a bit repetitive for me in the second half but never too much that it started being annoying. Overall a pretty masterful work.",

Lee Ermey's portrayal of the drill sergeant is iconic and copied but never equalled. Vincent Donofrio's portrayal of Private \"Pyle\" is not only the best of his career, but among the best you will see.  The second half of the movie is a look at the front lines from the perspective of Matthew Modine's character.  This is among the most dark and realistic portrayal of war ever filmed.    Kubrick's Direction and cinematography make this hard to watch at times, but worth the investment.",

The takes are long and filled with lengthy tracking shots, slow zooms and methodical pans, all traits of his later work.  Dealing with the devastating dehumanization of war on its participants, the film is essentially told in two parts – Marine basic training followed by combat in Vietnam.  The first portion features powerful performances by R. Lee Ermey as the sadistic Sergeant Hartman and Vincent D'Onofrio as the object of Hartman's abuse while the second half deals with Private Joker (Matthew Modine), a Marine journalist covering the war at the time of the Tet Offensive.  Where does the film falter?  Not for one second does the film look or feel like Vietnam, despite the dying palm trees spread around the shooting locations.  As well, the soundtrack (Chapel of Love, Wooly Bully, Surfin' Bird, etc.) is totally out of place and wince-worthy.  All in all, it's a decent movie – just not decent by Kubrick's standards.",

Full Metal Jacket is a harrowing, violent and foul-mouthed film, yet it is superbly done. True, one or two parts may lack tropical realism, but the atmosphere the film creates is extraordinary. The film looks excellent with skillful cinematography. The script is very well crafted and does have a sense of realism, while the story is compelling with the transition from the training at the camp to the bombed Vietamnesse city smoothly done. I am with those who thinks the first half is better than the second, but that is not to say the second half isn't good, it is more than good, but the first half really was outstanding. Kubrick's direction as always is superb, as is the acting especially Lee Ermey and Vincent D'Onofrio.

My ratings for Full Metal Jacket went up and down like a rollercoaster ride while viewing. It started as a 4 ; then going up to a 5 to only later drop to a 4.5; the 4.5 became a 3 but don't panic! My rating ended in a 4.5. I still cannot decipher why I cannot give it a full 5 but forget numbers. Full Metal Jacket is officially in the top 5 of Kubrick films. War films are nothing new but it's how you make something repetitive look new where you find cinema. He captures the dehumanization of a man in war.\n\nEvery scene has an important message and we see a blend of cynical humor, (surprisingly) heart, and disaster all in one. Full Metal Jacket does a full damn circle. Raftman begins timid, not really getting in on the war action until the end when he kills the sniper. He yells loud and proud with curse words how happy he is for murdering the enemy.\n\nJoker expresses his desire to shoot a gun at an early age yet he's conflictive thoughout the film, whether it's not wanting to join in on the soap-beating of Private Pyle or leaving the sniper to die on her own.\n\nAnimal is known as this rock with zero f**ks, a killing machine yet we almost see this as a facade of a man who is suffering on the inside from the war and whether or not he shows it, there's still some human in him.\n\nPyle is an interesting character. We experience the slow destruction of a human finishing in the climatic bathroom scene.\n\nIt's the ending for me. One can't help but chuckle to soldiers marching by burning buildings while singing a Mickey Mouse chant. But, the laughter is short because it is actually chilling. These men still are \"kids,\" who went into a controversial and unnecessary war extremely soon in their lives and in the process lost a huge chunk of their being, yet there is still a tiny percentage of childhood left in them. Talk about an ending. Also, one can't help but hear Gunnery Sergeant's Hartman voice saying, \"What is this Mickey Mouse horseshit?!\n\n\"In short, I'm in a world of shit yes, but I am alive and I'm not afraid.",

            "content": "One of Kubrick's later films, I really consider this film his best attempt to portray the ramifications of war since his early Paths of Glory. The plot of the film follows American soldiers from their first time army train camps to their horrifying experiences in the Vietnam war. The film is distinctively divided in two parts, the first, where we are presented the difficul times of some soldiers named Gomer Pyle, Joker, Animal Mother etc. in an army camp, and their training by psychotic Gunnery Seargant Hartman (R.L. Ermey, in what I believe to be one of the greatest acting achievements in film and some of the best character acting on the screen, I cannot get enough of him) up until the murder of Hartman by Gomer Pyle, who lost his mind after incessant bullying by his peer and harsh training, and the latter's suicide. Up until the ending of the first part, the film maintained a rather dark comical tone, with some harrowing moments, but overall excellent improv by Ermey. The second part of the film follows the soldiers in an attempt to fight off Vietnamese troops, and despite losing friends, they manage to clear the area, but with serious casualties, such as their mental health (important to note that the camera always follows Private Joker and the repercussions war has had on him). The characteristic ending follows the soldiers in a burning landscape marching to their base while singing the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse song, quite ironic, innit. I have nothing but praise for everything, from the carefully adapted screenplay that takes a rather cliche story and elevates it to a whole new level, to technical achievements such as cinematography, art direction, editing and art direction, the sigature Kubrick direction and amazing work from the cast. Only complaint is that after the end of the first part, the tone of the film shifts so suddenly that it takes a while to get used to it, it just feels like the two parts are two different movies. But overall, great film, possibly one of the most darkly comical, harrowing, hard hitting, best examples of war cinema to come out in the 80s. YOU LITTLE SCUMBAG, I GOT YOUR NAME, I GOT YOUR @SS.",

            "content": "A remarkable, yet uneven war classic.\n\nStanley Kubrick's war drama Full Metal Jacket (1987) boasts a brilliant first half condemning the American military's brainwashing training and toxic masculinity, meanwhile the second half leans into American racism and patriotism as an excuse for imperialism. It's a strange watch. I honestly wish that Kubrick had just stopped Full Metal Jacket at the climactic bathroom scene that is burned into every viewer's mind instead of carrying on with a generic Vietnam movie. The first half of Full Metal Jacket remains one of the best war films ever made, while the second half is hard to watch for the endless casual racism and sexism delivered by hothead white male stereotypes. \n\nFull Metal Jacket is certainly worth watching, but turn it off once you get halfway. You'll know when. The most gross racist stereotype of an Asian hooker comes on screen right after Full Metal Jacket's best scene. Stanley Kubrick, Gustav Hasford, and Michael Herr's writing leaves much to be desired. Their words during the training feel real and intense coming from a contemplative place, while all the crass jokes feel immature by any standard. I'm still disappointed by Kubrick allowing such despicable, racist trash into his film. Full Metal Jacket ranks as Kubrick's second worst film only after the boring Barry Lyndon, but that film at least has class.\n\nStanley Kubrick was a legendary filmmaker for his vivid storytelling, entertaining movies, thoughtful commentary, long panning shots, The Kubrick Stare close-up shot, and impeccably edited films. His direction is peerless at his peak. This is why it's so odd that Full Metal Jacket is such a lopsided film with questionable editing from Martin Hunter. His cuts in scenes are engaging, but you could easily cut down a half hour of Full Metal Jacket and lose nothing. It's 116 minutes for no reason. Douglas Milsome's cinematography is excellent with steady panning shots revolving around the barracks or along the firing line. The wide shots during the warzone combat in the second half are much shakier. It's no Spartacus.\n\nVivian Kubrick's score is something of an oddity. Her synth heavy music completely changes and elevates all the training in Full Metal Jacket's first half. On the other hand, her obnoxious drum choices and noises distract from the shootouts instead of making everything tense and suspenseful.\n\nIn all, I recommend Full Metal Jacket, but feel free to turn it off halfway.",

You never feel too invested in the characters, as little is fleshed out about who they are and why we should care. It ends on a somewhat anti-climactic and melancholy note, showing the pointlessness of war and the cost it takes in human lives. My main gripe is that it never truly \"feels\" like we are in Vietnam, due to the fact that it was shot in England with only a few imported palm trees to maintain the illusion. Too much gray and not enough green jungle to really make it look like Vietnam rather than a set in near London. Still a well made film and worth your time.",

If you want to be a person who feels smart by quoting a bad movie then by all means use this one. But if you'd rather go with a movie that was done better, had a clearer message, and is much less embarrassing to quote, go with Platoon or Apocalypse Now.

            "content": "It's hard to evaluate this film on it's own merits when considering the fact that one of the greatest directors of all time, Stanley Kubrick, made it and I recently saw The Deer Hunter (1978) and Apocalypse Now (1979). I will try to do that however as I still feel that divorced from the specter of those two elements this film doesn't completely work. I wasn't as disturbed as I should have been and I felt that a lot of the acting aimed for the sort of over the top pastiche that became iconic in a lot of Kubrick's other films but didn't quite reach it. It's not on the level of Barry Lyndon (1975) or A Clockwork Orange (1971) but it's unfair to ask for that level of quality with most films. This isn't a much watch unlike Kubrick's other work and I would recommend that you watch most of his other films before venturing to see this one.\n\nPrivate Joker, Matthew Modine, and Gomer Pyle, Vincent D'Onofrio, go through boot camp under the tutelage of Gunnery Sergeant Hartmann, R. Lee Ermey. Hartmann proves to be extremely tough and he turns all of the recruits against Pyle due to his being overweight which causes him to be physically and emotionally abused and ultimately commit a violent act. We jump forward to 1968 in the second half of the film as we see Joker become a journalist for The Stars and Stripes who write military propaganda. His relatively carefree life is interrupted when an attack on his marine base and he and other writers are left to defend themselves amongst the rubble. Eventually they discover that the sniper who murdered one of their friends is just a little girl but Joker is still pushed to kill her at her own request.\n\nThe scenes in the film that work best are, in my opinion, those that come in the second half of the film. The first half felt like it was stealing from Catch-22 (1970) and MASH (1970) with the satirical elements it incorporated and while Ermey's performance is deserving of it's iconic status I felt he was a touch overused. The second half settled down a little and chose to satirize propaganda and then show the dark effects of the war on innocent people. I was emotionally impacted by the scenes that feature people being devastated by warfare and while other films show death and destruction better Kubrick at least shows he can make a film in which he is emotionally engaged. This may be a controversial opinion because I understand that a lot of people are big fans of the first half while they think the second drops into mediocrity, I would still tend to disagree.\n\nI suppose another thing I felt was missing from this film was an interesting visual style. Every other Kubrick film looks amazing and you feel as though the director has focused each shot intensely in an attempt to execute his outlandish vision. Cinematographer Douglas Milsome also worked on three of Kubrick's other films so he clearly knows how to make a film look beautiful but this film just looks sort of blah. Even Platoon (1986) looks better than this film and I have many problems with that film relating to how the director deals with the material he is working with. Not every film needs to look incredible to be affecting but a large part of the reason why Kubrick films are so brilliant are their visuals and you expect to see something new and exciting on the screen every time you watch one of his films.\n\nIn the end I would say that this film is worth watching even if it's not a masterpiece because it's still post Paths of Glory (1957) Kubrick and we should treasure his work as he only provided us with a few great films but truly great ones at that. I am going to watch the only Kubrick film I have not seen this afternoon and I hope that it is better than this film but if it were on the same level I would still be able to appreciate it in some ways because it would still be better than most films.",

            "content": "(98/100)\nFull Metal Jacket is a perfect story about the duality of man, what it means to have individuality and what group mentality does to you. These two themes are excellently portrayed in forms of war and sex. Joker is the character that the audience latches on to because he is the physical embodiment of going through the phase of being individual or to have a group mentality. His decisions throughout the entire movie are determined by his own interest, except for the moments when he does something questionable, beating up Pyle for example. He does this not because he wants to, but because he is encouraged to, he does keep his individuality, portrayed by a peace sign on his chest. When Joker loses his individuality and truly becomes a mindless killing machine, his peace emblem is covered, he has lost his individuality. This moment is perhaps one of the greatest moments in cinema history and the entire movie drives towards showing this moment. All of the events with Pyle becoming insane, the soldier in the helicopter shooting innocent women and children and the U.S. soldiers having sex with Vietnamese prostitutes, while Joker is sitting of to the side saying nothing, are in direct correlation with the ending scene. This is really what makes this movie a great piece of cinema. Clear direction and a focused script really drive the narrative and the cinematography was also great. Overall, Full Metal Jacket is one of the best movies of all time and a clear indignation of what not to become as a human person, whether you are in a war or with a group of friends having a party.",

I picked this up at my local library on blu ray and watched it on a friday night. On the way home, my dad asked me what movie I got, I showed him the blu ray, and he was like \"that's a very good movie\" and yeah that was all. Watching Full Metal Jacket, it didn't remind me of other good war films I've seen. It was very different from Saving Private Ryan, Dunkirk, Hacksaw Ridge, it is really unique, probably the most unique war film I've ever seen. The storytelling and the elements in the story about the Vietnam war really made it raw. That's how I'd describe the movie, raw. R. Lee Ermey really gave one of the best performances in history in this movie, in my opinion. Even though he was on screen for about 15 minutes, he made those 15 minutes so intense, so great, and gives the movie dark comedic scenes. I think his performance as Sgt. Hartman is one of the best performances of all time. Vincent D'Onofrio's performance as a private that struggles in the beginning of the movie because of military training camp being too hard for him, and R. Lee Ermey's character being a hard mentor, challenging Vincent D'Onofrio's character physically and mentally, it is really compelling stuff. The part where he shoots Sgt. Hartman, then shoots himself, is one of the most jaw dropping scenes of all time. The look on Vincent D'Onofrio's face in that scene haunted me for the rest of that night. There is also another main character in this movie named Joker, (that's his nickname). He is in this military camp with Vincent D'Onofrio's character, and he goes through this camp, watching horrific things happen, you really get into the shoes of this character. The next acts of this movie is Joker going to Vietnam and experiencing the war. This part of the movie was really different from the first part back on Parris Island. A lot of people thought this 2nd part of the movie was not as good as the first part, but I thought both parts were great. The Vietnam war was portrayed so rough and raw in this movie, it was pretty breathtaking. The message/allegory of this story was so beautiful and 100% true, it really makes me look at war differently. The only issue I have with this movie is that I thought the movie really dragged at the middle of the film. Not much things were going on, there wasn't really much of a direction either, it just kind of felt like the story was going nowhere. Other than that, I thought this movie was really good. 9/10",

            "content": "Gran bel film firmato Stanley Kubrick. La pellicola è una di quelle in cui la storia è si importante ma la cosa più rilevante è il messaggio, la critica, che il regista vuole lanciare. In questo caso Kubrick si scaglia contro la guerra e l'addestramento militare che trasformano l'uomo in una macchina di morte, fatta solo per uccidere e infatti lo possiamo cogliere nel finale quando Joker uccide la ragazzina e i suoi compagni gli dicono di essere un \"duro\", o anche nel momenti in cui i personaggi difendono la base e nel mentre scherzano tra di loro. Il personaggio più umano è quello di Matthew Modine, ovvero Joker, e nonostante questo anche lui è diventato una macchina, non è più un uomo. Bellissimo il fatto che sull'elmetto, quindi sul cervello, avesse la scritta \"Born to kill\" e sul cuore avesse una spilla che rappresentava la pace. È stato bravissimo, ma Vincent D'Onofrio (Palla di lardo) e R. Lee Ermey (Sergente Hartman) sono stati strabilianti. Bella la colonna sonora, grandiosa la regia e anche la fotografia. Filmone.",

            "content": "This film is one of the first that comes to mind when thinking of all of Kubrick's masterpieces, and it's not hard to see why. For starters, the setting brilliantly captures the tense atmosphere of Marine Corps training to prepare for war. This is best demonstrated when looking at the character Leonard Lawrence, better known as Private Pyle. Over the course of the first half of the film, Sargent Hartman, the brutal drill instructor, belittles him for being slow-witted and overall just not prepared for battle. To make matters worse he decides to punish the rest of the Marines for Pyle's mistakes. This is first seen when Pyle smuggles a doughnut because he could not deal with the feeling of hunger. Hartman retaliates by forcing the entire cabin to do intense exercises, causing them all to dislike Pyle. Tired of all of Pyle's screw ups, the entire bunk gives Pyle a beating. By each getting a towel, filling it with a bar of soap, and proceeding to hit him in the stomach repeatedly while others hold him down. After feeling immense pain and realizing that everyone hates him, Pyle loses all emotion and becomes a killing machine. Hartman and the others are very proud of him and all seems well until the next night. Private Joker, one of Pyle's fellow Marines, hears a noise in the restroom and decides to investigate only to find Pyle loading a rifle. Joker tells Pyle to go back to sleep and put his rifle away or else they will be in a world of shit. Pyle responds with, \"I'm already in a world of shit!\", and proceeds to repeat various chants that were spoken on their marches. After hearing all of the shouting Hartman storms in and proceeds to yell at Pyle and belittle him more. Void of all emotion and thought, Pyle shoots Hartman in the chest, killing him. Realizing what he had done, Pyle spends a few minutes reflecting, only before putting the rifle in his mouth and blowing his brains out. While all of this is very malicious and depressing, it is very realistic and corresponds to the tense environment of war to the point that it is almost beautiful. The training portion of the film is one of my favorite parts of any movie to this date earning this movie an easy five star rating. The section that illustrates war in Vietnam is also well made, but is honestly quite forgettable when looking at the first half of the film. Yet, this is still a movie that I would recommend to anyone, whether they typically enjoy films of this genre.",

Up until Pyle shot himself, I had assumed that this story was about Pyle. It was interesting to me that the perspective seemed to change in each part of the film. The first part seemed to be more from Pyle's perspective, to then set up the second part of the film being from Joker's perspective. It made me feel intrigued by the psyche of the men in the military. It made me also feel concerned for how the constant negating and invalidating affects these men. The pace of the film was also interesting. Things sort of seemed to have a slow build in the beginning up until Pyle's emotional turn took place. For me, the same thing happened in the second part of the film when Joker and his crew were backed into a corner with the Vietnamese. In both parts of the film, it was interesting that there was this slower-paced nonchalant approach to setting up these stories, however, once things got going we very much-so \"zoomed in\" to the conflict in the story and what was going on. Music was a big part of the movie, however, in these moments Kubrick chose to have no, or very little, music be a part of them. For me, it allowed me to be more attentive to what was going on and what was at stake.",

Matthew Modine at the centre of it pulls it off swiftly and smoothly but is overpowered by a stunning performance by Vincent D'Onofrio despite of just being a supportive character.

            "content": "Maybe not as good as it's been talked up to be, but still a solid war film. \n\nBased on Gustav Hasford's novel The Short Timers, the film's first half details the volunteers' harrowing boot-camp training under the profane, power-saw guidance of drill instructor Sgt. Hartman (R. Lee Ermey, a real-life drill instructor whose performance is one of the most terrifyingly realistic on record). Part two takes place in Nam, as seen through the eyes of the now thoroughly indoctrinated marines. Ironically, Full Metal Jacket was filmed almost entirely in England.\n\n\"Full Metal Jacket\" was one of the movies that was talked about when I praised films such as \"Hacksaw Ridge\". Apparently, this was the war film to behold, as it was just as good, if not better. I recently got the opportunity to view this movie and by that, it means I was in the mood for it and I saw it on Netflix. I really don't think this film is as good as its reputation suggests it is, but it's still solid. It's certainly the best film ever made, but it's certainly not bad. I guess it's just dated if anything. \n\nI'm not sure if this is a complaint or not, but this really did feel like two different films. The first hour of this film took place at boot camp. It felt repetitive, it dragged a bit, and even though it ended shockingly, it still wasn't enough for an A+ film. Then, when the second half came on, it became an entirely different film. In fact, all the weight the first half had became meaningless. So essentially, this was two different movies. I guess that really is a problem in the end, because by that point, why care about anything that happened in either half? \n\nThe acting wasn't that great. The only real solid performance from here was Matthew Modine's performance. I actually thought he did a really good job. I thought his performance stood out amongst the rest, especially when other ones stood out negatively. A lot of the performances in this movie were less than adequate. They were either cheesy, cringe worthy, laughable, or just downright awkward. I don't think the best cast was chosen for this film, regardless of what the persona of their character was supposed to be. \n\nAlthough it's not the most visually grossing or hard hitting war film, it boasts these concepts and ideas that are pretty tough at times. The overall language and what was acceptable to say back then is completely different than it is today. I liked seeing that difference in past cultures and how we acted compared to how we do today. It also showed some things that did show that war is ugly. It's not pretty, it has its moments, and I think this film showed those aspects well.\n\nIn the end, this isn't the best movie by any means. It's good, it has its fair share of problems. Maybe it's a bit dated, but maybe it was really good for its release year. In the end, I'm fairly neutral with it.",

            "content": "Full Metal Jacket is not just about war, but rather the psychology behind it. A smart move from the legend that was Stanley Kubrick. We've all seen many war films, a genre that is well explored from a variety of different conflicts. Full Metal Jacket however chooses to go behind the scenes and focus on the training process that changes well intentioned men into trained lethal killers. You could easily split this in half and have two separate films, the first half being more psychologically charged whereas the latter showcasing the brutality of warfare. A ridiculously serious drill sergeant practically bullying a trainee marine so harshly that it slowly turns him into an unstable psychopath. That right there, was some really good psychology and made the film so much more interesting. Sure the Vietnam War scenes were depicted with a substantial amount of fire, blood and guns but it was the first half that really captivated me. Vincent D'Onofrio was the stand out for me, both convincing and expressive through his face. Matthew Modine was good, probably his best performance. Lee Ermey deserves recognition just for somehow managing to not lose his voice from all the shouting. Characterisation was present, perhaps not fully fleshed out as I would like but was just enough for me to care about them. Yet again though, it's the technical marvel that wins...Stanley Kubrick. His directing style is so damn flawless. The nice clean long takes, actors looking directly into the camera, slow motion deaths (particularly in the sniper shootout)...he is just phenomenal. Script was sharp as well. A great section of dialogue where our lead character wears a peace badge and a helmet that says \"born to kill\" for which he describes represents the duality of man. That really stuck with me. So whilst it might feel like two separate films (due to that ridiculously quick transition), it's hard not to appreciate everything that's shown to us. Another hit from Mr. Kubrick.",

The first half of the film focuses on the training of a platoon of marines on Parris Island, in the U.S.\nOne of the recruits Private Lenny Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio) struggles with army life and the loud rule of the Sergeant (Lee Ermey).\nFor about an hour of the film we see the portly Lawrence be for want of a better word be bullied by his commanding officer and fellow recruits before he snaps. \nThe warning signs are all there. The raised eye facial expressions that are a trademark of Kubrick films (A Clockwork Orange and The Shining spring to mind.)\nThe recruits become competent users of killer weapons and are warned by the Sergeant himself in one scene how ruthless killers like Lee Harvey Oswald were trained to shoot by the US Marines.\nThe second half of the film is set in Vietnam itself in a variety of locations.\nHere the film became confusing as it drifted from one set piece to another.

There were still flashes of greatness, but it didn't gel into a complete story as well as I expected. However, the themes were effectively conveyed. You really get a feel for how damaging war can be on the men who must fight it, and what the military is compelled to do in order to keep those men fighting (even in a lost cause.) The final confrontation of the film is devastating and I love how it wraps things up and pays off on things foreshadowed up to that point. In fact, the more I reflect on the movie, the more I recognize its brilliance. I wonder if, upon further viewings, I might find that this is truly a 5-star classic. The only thing that makes me skeptical about the quality of Full Metal Jacket is Matthew Modine. I don't think he's the best actor for this role, and he doesn't really \"become\" the character. Everyone else seems perfectly fit to the film (particularly Lee Ermey as Gny. Sgt. Hartman) but he stands out as an actor delivering an uncomfortable performance that doesn't work as well as I would like.

I think this is why a lot people say that the boot camp portion is better than the larger portion of the movie that actually takes place in Vietnam.\n\nSpoilers: It's not.\n\nThere is a difference between being anti-military and anti-war, neither opinions are clearly right or wrong and that (among some other themes, masculinity being the other most obvious one) is what this movie is about. In boot camp we all want to be Joker. He's the intellectual, sarcastic one who understands \"the duality of man\" after all. \n\nBut when you get on the ground Animal Mother starts to make a whole lot more sense.\n\nOverall I think it could have been a bit better if it had sunk into a more definitive style and the voice over could have been removed without losing almost anything of importance.

I was with this film it doesn't get the best deserve that it should be. As my only favorite of Stanley Kubrick and I  give every single of his film a perfect 10 because of what I really desire and films that Stanley Kubrick brings into cinema. Clockwork Orange is very simple and yet fun to watch. Full metal jacket is doing the same thing. And is trying to make fun of the horror of war that is the only topic that Stanley Kubrick is bringing into this film genre. Full metal jacket is a must watch for everybody to see you to witness what man has to fear and yet of  what is fearless. One of the best executed films that I ever seen that brings in the Vietnam war which it is a fake that the government has to bring in it to the American people. From Boot Camp to war. This is a strong telling of what is soldier went through to Vietnam. And yet deserves the recognition that Stanley Kubrick absolutely deserves and his film. \n\nGrade \nA perfect 10",

The concept of insanity lures in both movies and are shown in very successful ways both times. The first half of \"Full Metal Jacket\" blew me away and I enjoyed every single insult that came out of the mouth of Sergeant Hartman's mouth, who were beautifully portrayed by R. Lee Ermey. The second half, however, was a bit disappointing, because it took some time for me to get used to the new warfare surrounding, which wasn't really present at all in the first half of the movie. Matthew Modine is really good in the movie and he is without a doubt the best thing in the second half of the movie.

But it's hard to call this a war film, as there's no one to root for, or sympathize with, or identify with.  This is certainly a Kubrick film: masterfully crafted and interesting with naturalistic performances and provocative images.  But it's also something less: in its negativity and cynicism and dehuminization, it's more of a nihilist jaunt through violence and depravity than an artistic statement.  There's no real tragedy, only the fate of poor Gomer Pyle, probably the unique spirit that can't survive in the army.  Instead of hinting at his themes, Kubrick has his \"Joker\" shout them at you, informing his conversant that the peace symbol and \"born to kill\" on his helmet represents \"the duality of man\".  \n\nPerhaps Full Metal Jacket is about nothing more than how humans can kill and be killed.  Or perhaps it's a meandering and ultimately toothless attempt to satirize war by having monstrous men do monstrous things on camera.  But what we'll never know is why Kubrick slowed down so suddenly, how the man who once wished to film Napoleon with 50,000 real soldiers settled for R Lee Ermey slinging violent language at young men.  How can the same man who made 2001 make Full Metal Jacket after Apocalypse Now and The Deer Hunter already existed?  What happened to the compelling and heroic humanity of Paths of Glory, or unstoppable craftsman of The Shining?  It's safe to say we'll never know.  \n\nBut as for Full Metal Jacket, there's blood, there's yelling and there's death.  There's men who are mere cartoons of men, foreigners who amount to nothing more than whores and cowardly snipers.  Lacking the dynamism and sheer brilliance and beauty of every Kubrick film from Paths of Glory to The Shining, Full Metal Jacket just doesn't measure up.  You'll laugh at first, until you realize that a man is being tortured on screen, and then you'll hate the rest of them, and you might just wish that they all die, or better, that they all get killed, which is apparently all that humans can do according to this movie.",

That was not the case for me watching Full Metal Jacket.  I found that it was the complete opposite actually.  This movie is somewhat split into two totally different parts.  Kubrick depicts a group of Marines during their experience in boot camp, with a downright brutal drill sergeant.  You follow these guys through all of their training and day to day routines getting ready to get their assignment and get shipped off to Vietnam to fight for the country.  This is actually the part of the movie I enjoyed the most.  When they actually get to the war I felt the movie starts to drag a little bit.  Maybe it was just that the boot camp was so intense and the story of Private Pile so engrossing and somewhat disturbing towards the end that I just thought the movie could have honestly ended there.  This movie surely isn't for everyone, I do not feel it is a classic war movie, but it is solid nonetheless.",

Full Metal Jacket is directed by Stanley Kubrick and is an outstanding film that features excellent performances from all, terrific cinematography and a well matched score to really improve and work with the tone of this film. I thought this was my least favourite Kubrick film and i still really enjoyed it. My only problem with full metal jacket is that, i don't care about the characters that much, except for Vincent D'onfrio's and when he killed himself halfway through the movie, i was a little disapointed, he was by far my favourite character and he was killed off like that. i don't think it was a bad choice for the way the film was going, but i definatley would have liked it a tad more if he were in it until the credits. So, i really enjoyed Full Metal Jacket. What's your favourite Kubrick film?",

It had the misfortune of being released during the mid-80's/early-90's Vietnam movie wave so it got lumped in with middling-to-shitty movies like \"Hamburger Hill\" and  \"Casualties of War.\"  Watching it separate from that period, it's Stanley Kubrick at the top of his game and a perfect bookend for his \"Paths of Glory.\"  The Parris Island sequence is so strong that absolutely nothing that comes after it, even the relative novelty of urban warfare in Hue City, can hope to top it, but the second half is more impressive on a purely technical level (tons of single-take sequences, somehow turning the Eastend of London into a pretty fair facsimile of Phu Bai and surrounding areas, a scarily mean performance from Adam Baldwin as a sort of proto-Jayne Cobb) while ramping up the black comedy to 11.  We'll just ignore how \"Me so horny\" got perverted into every white and black asshole's opening comeon to Asian girls (these morons don't know that credit ratings aren't sexually transmitted), but it says something about Kubrick's greatness/genius/whatever as a director and writer that so many images, lines, and other snapshots from \"FMJ,\" \"2001,\" \"A Clockwork Orange,\" and \"The Shining\" are forever ingrained into Western pop culture.",

            "content": "Apparently my general opinions on this movie are pretty common: I loved the first half and enjoyed the second half a little less. There's a number of reasons for why, but I think the main one is that the first half has this propulsive quality to it that the second half just lacks.\n\nEvery scene in the first half just zips by because of the drill instructor Sgt. Hartman, who just never lets up, screaming constantly so it's impossible to look away even for a second (this is especially because R. Lee Ermey is so magnetic in the role). The pacing of the first half feels flawless; the audience still needs to feel small moments of reprieve out of necessity, and so those are provided for in the scenes between Pyle and Joker. You really feel for Pyle in those scenes, and get this sense that he's a gentle giant, this poor ignorant guy who just needs someone to be there for him when he's relentlessly tortured by Hartman. Joker provides that kind relief that Pyle (and the audience) needs in between exhausting scenes with Hartman. And then that all ends when Pyle is assaulted by his fellow Marine volunteers, and Joker reluctantly takes part. It's pretty tragic because Joker doesn't realize at the time that if he had stood up for Pyle, if he'd stuck by him in his hardest moments, maybe what inevitably happens wouldn't have happened. And yeah, we haven't even talked about that final scene, in which Pyle kills Hartman and then himself. Just crazy, man. I sort of saw it coming that he would go crazy, but I somehow thought the movie wouldn't go there, and it did.\n\nThe second half has a lot of standout images and dialogue that make it far from pointless. Adam Baldwin's character, Animal Mother, is an interesting guy because it's pretty damn heartless until the end, when he vows to get revenge on the sniper who killed his friends, and then in the last scene, when he's disgusted by the thought of killing a little girl. There are some funny lines, like Joker's talk about the peace sign and the 'born to kill' writing representing the 'duality of man,' and there are some interesting, thematically strong interludes, like when one soldier reveals that the guy sitting next to him under a blanket is a dead Vietnamese soldier, brought back as some sort of sick prize. All of these moments of originality and thematic potency are especially powerful because of Stanley Kubrick's direction. He shoves you into all of these scenes and forces you to confront them; when Rafterman records the man with the pet Vietcong carcass on camera, we see it from the camera's point of view, so it's like the twisted soldier is telling us directly. There are a lot of moments like that in the movie, when people seem to be staring right at us, especially at the end, when the wounded sniper girl looks up at us and begs us to shoot her. And then there's the whole recurring idea of the 'thousand yard stare,' and Joker's final action in killing the young girl and achieving that stare. His choice to kill her, while merciful in a way, is dark because we've seen him resisting darkness the whole movie, and we've hoped that maybe he could make up for his role in Pyle's bullying. But finally he kills the girl, and it's ostensibly merciful, but it sure looks like execution to us.\n\nSo there are a lot of images in the second half that are great and carry a lot of emotional and satirical heft, even if that meaning is as reductive as \"war sucks,\" something that tons of movies, like Apocalypse Now, have already done. And the shapelessness that makes me not like the second half as much has been said to have a point. War, after all, is shapeless and confusing and chaotic and messy. Still, just because a movie's unpleasant (exaggerating for effect here) structure and pacing are that way for the express purpose of making a point doesn't mean they're enjoyable on a shallow level, and I like my movies to be at least somewhat entertaining on a shallow level. There's a ruthless efficiency to the first half that's inevitably missed in the second level, even if the formal elements continue to support the tone of the respective sections.\n\nOverall, this was a movie I really enjoyed, with a kickass, tragic first half with a unique setting in a boot camp, and a second half that was a little less enjoyable because of its slow-paced shapelessness and the absence of Ermey and Vincent D'Onofrio. Still, there were enough vivid images and nice dialogue throughout the second half that it made up for most of its shortcomings and delivered an adequate second half to an ambitious, dark story.",

            "content": "By 1987, numerous Vietnam films have arrived to the silver screen, the most notable example being Coppola´s \"Apocalypse Now\", \"The Deer Hunter\", and Stone´s \"Platoon\". So what could Kubrick offer? The answer: The polarizing \"two films in one\" movie \"Full Metal Jacket\". \nWe follow the training and service of some young men who are eager to \"fight the good fight\" in Vietnam. \nOut of all the short list of Stanley Kubrick films, this is the film that I consider the most peculiar and experimental as I find the choices Kubrick made bizarre but extremely fascinating. \"Full Metal Jacket\" is this intriguing version of the Vietnam War that has solid acting with the best being R. Lee Ermey in an iconic role and Vincent D´Onofrio; the dialog is extremely sharp edge and vulgar but surprisingly is hilarious at times and mostly memorable, Kubrick´s most distinctive use of music as they are widely popular songs or highly irrelevant to the war setting, an uneven pacing that at times takes you out of the experience but at others it flawlessly works as it literally throws you into the scene, the cinematography is as gorgeous as most Kubrick films, a distant and omnipresent storytelling that creates this cynical style, the themes are executed extremely effectively, some of the visuals are haunting and realistic, and Kubrick provides his most experimental directing as most of the time it is fast and feels like the whole film is a montage. The biggest criticisms the film are that the first half is incredible but the second is dull and forgettable, of course the most iconic and memorable section is the first half and while the second half never reaches that level of quality it also has some memorable moments, particularly the climax of the film. The other criticism is the overall feel of the film (some Vietnam vets consider it extremely accurate but others consider it a fantasy take of the war) because it is not like other Vietnam films where they are set in a jungle and have more moral dilemmas; it is an odd way to present war but I believe that the film is not about Vietnam but about war in generally due to its dehumanization themes (actually the visuals are more reminiscent of urban warfare and the War on Terror, which is scary considering this is a film from the 80´s).  \n\"Full Metal Jacket\" is an experimental take of the Vietnam War that feels like two great movies smashed together via montage. While it is by no means one of the Kubrick´s greatest, it is not one of the weakest. It is funny, haunting, heavy on themes, and the most interesting Kubrick film (directing wise).",

            "content": "Even though Full Metal Jacket was made in 1987, Director Stanley Kubrick had already been around for a long time--for example, he's known for filming the largely satirical Dr. Strangelove in the early 60s. His filming ingenuity only got better as time went on, and Full Metal Jacket is proof of this fact. In this movie, Kubrick relied heavily on a soundtrack to tell the narrative through the technique of satire. I believe that this soundtrack is used to establish an ironical relationship between the audience and the characters in the movie. In other words, Kubrick uses the soundtrack as an ironic plot device. For example, the choice to use \"The Chapel of Love\" while the men are at war serves to either make fun of or emphasize the desperate attitudes of some of the soldiers experiencing post-traumatic stress. In other words, the movie indirectly makes fun of steadfast patriotism when war instead really promises mental insanity.",

            "content": "Review In A Nutshell:\n\nWhen we think of war, the images that come to our head are the smoke that slowly breathes out of a fired rifle, the red blood that stains the green uniform, the flash of an exploding grenade; these are dark images that fill the puzzle of war's brutality and horror, but what these images do not show is the horrors that lurk underneath; the human spirit fractured in order to fulfil their duty as soldiers. Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket stands along with films like Apocalypse Now, The Thin Red Line, and Paths of Glory where war is seen through the eyes of the soldiers and how their experiences have affected them internally; the unseen soul.\n\nThe film begins with the sight of men sitting down and having their hair shaved completely off with faces of both sadness and uncertainty. It is the U.S. Marine's first step in attempting to take what is most precious of them, their identities. It is the idea that each and every one of these soldiers will be identical fighting machines, despite the drill instructor denying this, to strip them completely of what they were and instil a new perspective on yourself, your brothers, and your enemies. The film then takes us to the intimidating introduction of their drill instructor, Sergeant Hartman, a man who response only to sheer volume and intensity, constantly searching for flaws and anomalies in the soldiers' systems and destroying them little by little. This is also where we get to see these soldiers further lose themselves, through the replacement of their names with nicknames that are far from who they really are, aside from maybe Joker, whom which probably impressed the Sergeant despite his disrespect. During this introduction is also the time where the audience is formally introduced to Leonard Lawrence, who is better known in the camp as Gomer Pyle, as a connection to his inherent dimwittedness and innocence; he becomes the Sergeant immediate target because he knows Gomes Pyle is not right for the corps but since he is already present and unlikely to quit, he has to do the best he can to push him to his highest limits. Gomer Pyle's journey through the training is one of the most terrifying experiences I have ever seen, showing how a fresh young face could fall so low in human spirit; a soul that has suffered psychological and emotional torment, betrayal from his once loyal and respected brothers, having to endure demanding and straining physical training, it all adds up in shaping what he would ultimately become, a soulless monster. The end of this half delivered one of the most gasping moments of the entire film, the bathroom massacre. A slow moving Joker flashes his light on Gomer Pyle, revealing him in possession of a live cartridge that is then locked and loaded into his rifle. It is clear that the training he has endured has pushed him too far, deprived of happiness and consciousness, knowing only his duty as a marine corps, to kill. It is the horrifying image of his wicked stare that shivers the audience's bones, not the loaded rifle itself; it is the idea that he has gone too far to find salvation, and it was only in the sound of his once precious name that a glimmer came to his eye and decides to end himself once and for all, sparing Joker's life. It is a moment that stays with you long after the film ends, reminding you of the many Gopher Pyles out there walking and causing pain to those undeserving of it.\n\nThe second half of the film then turns to the big stage, Vietnam and the war that deeply affected everyone that took part in it. It still follows in the eyes of Joker who works as a correspondent for an American newspaper, Stars and Stripes, which aimed to report news, boost soldier morale, and sway the minds of those unconvinced of America's involvement in the war; it is an element that Kubrick only covers minimally, but hearing it spoke volumes to me; displaying more of what the war really is, without having to actually show it. It would have been fantastic if Kubrick further covered it. After a suicide squad attempting to infiltrate their base, Joker was assigned to the \"shit\" with his photographer Rafterman, and from there we experience the true nature of soldier warfare; the unpredictability, the paranoia, the destruction that surrounds them, all coming to together to slowly destroy the innocent mind of our protagonist; a person who had a sense of balance, surviving the war with killing in his head, \"Born to Kill\", and forgiveness in his heart, the peace symbol, retaining that part of himself that keeps him sane. The film subtly throughout this half, question the true agenda of the soldier's stay in Vietnam, told from the perspective of the soldiers themselves through documentary-like interviews that show honest and thoughtful responses. The film then leads to a gripping climax of a sniper picking off their platoon, one by one. It is a tense situation that ends with harrowing imagery. It is revealed that the sniper is just a young girl, and through this Kubrick scares us with the idea that children were raised and trained in order to fight for their causes, youth losing its innocence far too early, wanting her life to end rather than ask for medical attention; it is a frightening scene that shows just how damaged our world is. Ending the film, is a slightly touching scene of soldiers marching in the night, singing out loud a song from their beloved childhood; holding tight a piece of themselves in order to get through god-awful war.\n\nFull Metal Jacket may not be the most obvious film in regards to Kubrick's sense of visual and audible flair, but the film's grounded visual take on the war is meaningful and terrifying. During the film's first half, it captures the uniform and tightness of military training, a zone where anarchy and natural movements are absent. During interior scenes, we get a layer of darkness that connects with the gradual loss of the souls of its subjects, coming off more like a mental asylum rather than a barrack; very few films could capture this without becoming too stylish in its imagery. The second half of the film opens up with a larger canvas, displaying the destructive conditions of the war; with sights of crumbling buildings, flaming interiors, and abundance of dirt. The film still manages to be a spectacle without forgetting the film's most important subjects, the characters. The second half spends a fair amount of time with the camera closer to the ground, along the feet of the soldiers, like as if we were trying to take cover from enemy fire, a paranoia of having our heads stand too high; it maintains a sense of uneasiness that correlates with the emotions of its characters. Kubrick almost strips the whole film with vibrant colours, keeping the film feeling deathly and soul crushing; pushing dark greens and dusty browns, the colours that immediately bring to mind the conditions of war.\n\nThe haunting score by Vivian Kubrick, under the alias of Abigail Mead, dominates the film's scenes through generating dark and atmospheric emotions that elevate the film's themes and tension; just listen to the rumbling seedy tones during the bathroom massacre. The same goes for the sniper sequence, with music that crawls under our skin and feeds dark and fracturing emotions. The combination of Kubrick's score and Americana soundtrack gave the film that sense of balance and flavour, coming off as different from the other films that cover the same ground; it never tries to over-dramatize its scenes, instead the score reaches for the darker depths of the film's characters without drama elevation, while the soundtracks are present to create a hilarious satire of America's presence in the war.\n\nMatthew Modine is the film's protagonist, Private Joker, but I felt his performance was a bit underwhelming as compared to others that have led in a Kubrick film; the writing certainly makes his role feel interesting but his performance rarely ever elevates it. The shining star in this film is an actor who only appears during the first half of the film, and that is Vincent D'Onofrio playing as Gomer Pyle; a transformational performance that captures the essence of his character perfectly.\n\nFull Metal Jacket is an example of a war film attempting to be more than what it plainly is; it showcases the inherent nature of war and its effects on the human mind and soul. It tells a story that is not restricted by a conventional three act approach, and it features a stand out performance from D'Onofrio as the lovable turned deadly, Gomer Pyle. I think I'm going to love this film for a long time.",

He'd explored space with systematic corruption and boredom, and the insane, hysteric horror of a human mind and condition. Both of those are his 3.5-star masterpieces. His best work belongs to the battlefield of the war genre. In that field he'd explored the consequences of stopping yourself from following commands and get framed and shot for cowering, and the satiric reason why we need to learn to \"stop worrying and love the bomb.\" Now before his final project of \"Eyes Wide Shut,\" he returned to the battlefield one more time to add another the story to the chronicles of the Vietnam War, and it'd resulted to be his best masterpiece.\n\n\"Full Metal Jacket\" explores the process of a new recruit entering from boot camp to the battlefields in the U.S. Marine Corps. The first 20 minutes were the recruits' training period. It was a masterful exposition with the cast only saying things that are around under the category of \"Sir, yes sir!\" to R. Lee Ermey's not-so fictional character when he was a drill instructor at that time the film takes place. He stands out and shines the most out of the cast when his performance is so good that it's probably the best of the film. He was also expressing a theme with a message to be analyzed and he had Vincent D'Onofrio as his volunteer to help out that message to the unfortunate outcome: D'Onofrio's character was mirroring a bit of how Jack Nicholson's character gone through in \"The Shining,\" but by the subject of the expressed theme of hypocrite bullying.\n\nNow for the main story that'd took the next 93 minutes was the main setting: fighting in the war on tour. Matthew Modine's character James Davis is the story's narrator going over how haunting and violent the Vietnam War can from what he'd experienced from commander of the recruits with a thirst to see combat to \"later becomes an independent-minded combat correspondent.\" We'll be soon get in combat side-by-side with his old comrades from Sergeant Hartman's (R. Lee Ermey) boot camp, when he's nicknamed the Joker - representing some of the film's occasional light-hearted humor.\n\nThe way how Davis's experiences in the war were constructed in the film was nicely done as usual in the war genre. The effects of combat, including the power and energy from the actors pretending/acting like they're in the war, and the performances are what a war flick reload to keep the power going.\n\n\"Full Metal Jacket\" is a nice addition to the Vietnam War chronicles with the usual qualities at their efforts to match the pounding of a war's battlefield, making this war drama Kubrick's best masterful work in exploring more in the process of serving a war while at the same time rarely reminiscing few of his past explorations, with stuff to express.

The Vietnam act suffers from Kubrick's obvious struggle in effectively filming combat zones and firefights, but his narrative is constructed so well in its bleakness and despair that it doesn't matter too much. Juxtaposition of period rock music is unsettling as well.

Though moments tend to drag here and there, Kubrick contributes his signature vision to the film that exists in all of his work and differentiates him as one of the greats.

Lee Ermey as the drill sergeant from Hell and Vincent D'Onofrio as the Marine trainee who undergoes a seriously frightening mental breakdown (the bathroom scene is impossible to forget).",

Whether it be focusing on the exploitation of soldiers from their peers in \"Paths of Glory\" or laughing to the nuclear gallows with \"Dr. Strangelove,\" it was obvious that Kubrick preferred cynicism over warmth. 'Full Metal Jacket' most certainly follows Kubrick's cynical perception, a movie that reflects the Marine Corps deconstruction of the human being to become a natural born killer. Thematically, Kubrick's anti-war message is one that has been told time and time again. However, and with the help of the hilarious Sergeant Hartman (Ermey) - a character that continually shouts disgusting simile's and metaphors that creates an enjoyable balance of dark humour - Kubrick's deliverance of this recycled message is undeniably riveting. Besides Ermey's performance, Kubrick's ability as craftsman most certainly elevates the somewhat tiresome material. Not only is the direction spot on but also the meticulous touches to the lighting and music that contribute to overall harrowing affect (especially during the sequence where Pyle commits suicide; the lighting, the direction and music all combine perfectly to reflect the descent into violent madness). \r\n\r\nHowever, while these themes are portrayed with power, there are times where you feel Kubrick is being too cynical or simply too simplistic. Surely all Marine Corps are not systematic to point that there is no room for some gesture of humour or characterization? I know Kubrick is representing the  deconstruction of humane qualities contributed from war, but such a focus makes the story at times rather dull (this is quite noticeable in the second half with the spark of the Ermey missing and the audience are left with a group of uninteresting cold-blooded killing machines). Besides these shortcomings in the second half, Kubrick's direction of Nam's battlefields are once again riveting. Revisiting the tracking shots he adopted in 'Paths of Glory,' Kubrick places the camera in a position so the audience are invited into the films battle depictions against the backdrop of the beautiful destructive scenery. Rather than giving the audience the benefit of an omnipresent vision, Kubrick situates the audience in the soldiers position which creates a realistic feel that many war films seem to lack. Fundamentally, while Kubrick's vision at times is too cynical, \"Full Metal Jacket\" features a great amount of enjoyable black humour and a craftsman at the top of his game.",

But even setting these aside, Full Metal Jacket never really starts from a war perspective. It starts with the scrutinizing life under a drill sergeant(incredible performance by R. Lee Ermey) and slowly eases into the war scene. However even during war, the scenes slowly eases into the heart of the war. The cinematography is beautiful and if you notice, most of the shots have been taken during the golden hour where the best lighting for films are possible.

The film is based on the novel 'The Short Timers' by Gustaph Hasford and portraits the training and actual combat action of some young marines during the Vietnam War. Kubrick is a master in storytelling by showing hard facts mixed with well-chosen music. A couple of scenes will be glued to your memory. This 'Full Metal Jacket' is a must-see classic. Starring Matthew Modine (The Transporter 2, Weeds), Adam Baldwin (Predator 2, Independence Day), Vincint D'Onofrio (Men in Black, The Cell) and R. Lee Ermey (The Texas Chainsaw remakes, Willard). \n\n1967, Senior Drill Instructor Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (Ermey) trains a load of U.S. Marine Corps recruits in their boot camp. His iron fist will discipline the boys. One of them is James Davis (Modine), who is given the nickname 'Joker'. He dares to take a stand and considered to be in charge of his fellow recruits. Another is the clumsy overweight Leonard Lawrence (D'Onofrio) who earns the nickname 'Gomer Pyle'. He suffers the most from Hartman's boot camp training. With some help from 'Joker', he does seem to improve. But when Hartman discovers that 'Gomer Pyle' has stashed away a jelly doughnut: the whole squad is punished for his deeds...\n\nThe following year, 'Joker' has become a war correspondent at the Vietnam War. When the Tet Offensive kicks in, he joins a platoon of Marines on a deadly mission. There he sees one of his of boot camp mates and meets machine gunner 'Animal Mother' (Baldwin). Will they live to tell the tale?",

The film takes place during the Vietnam War, with the first half focusing on basic training and the second half on the soldier's experiences in Vietnam. The first half is really where the film shines, having a clear message with so very humorous insults from R. Lee Ermey (who was a real-life drill instructor). When the film switches over to Vietnam, however, the film gradually goes downhill. There are a bunch of little short segments, most of them not being important to the story at all, but there are so truly great moments, especially the helicopter scene. Also, alll of the battle scenes are extremely well done, especially the final battle between the soldiers and the sniper. Full Metal Jacket isn't a perfect film, especially with it's disappointing second half, but it's truly great scenes mostly make up for this.",

Based off The Short-Timers, a semi-autobiographical book by Gustav Hasford, Full Metal Jacket follows a US Marine platoon going through training, later transitioning its focus to two Marines of the platoon in the Tet Offensive during the Vietnam War.  The film does tons of detail exploring the steps that are taken into becoming a Marine, including following orders correctly, moving through obstacles quickly and flawlessly, remaining organized, preparing weapons correctly, and remaining close to the squad the soldier is assigned to.  The film, like many masterful war films, uses tons of graphic violence and personal conflict in order to add realism and humanity to the story in order to prevent Full Metal Jacket from going into generic war film territory.  Stanley Kubrick uses his unbelievable genius to craft a film that says \"war\".  He does an incredible job by giving audiences heart breaking battle sequences that also shock them rather than entertain them (thank God, because war is disgraceful).  Kubrick, Michael Herr, and author Hasford craft a script that expands Part I, and contains elements of Part II and III, yet omits Part III.  Part II isn't that engaging or as interesting or psychologically disturbing as Part I, but is still a key element to the story, even if it's message isn't that great.  The acting is stellar, most particularly R. Lee Ermey as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, a ruthless, mean, foul-mouthed drill instructor who actually was played by a US Marine drill instructor who was in service during the Vietnam War, and Vincent D'Onofrio as Private Leonard \"Gomer Pyle\" Lawrence, an overweight, clumsy, incompetent, slow-witted recruit who in fact becomes the focus for Sergeant Hartman for his flaws.  In fact, R. Lee Ermey's scene where he chewed out the new recruits was mostly improvised, despite the fact that Kubrick never allowed his actors to improvise, although he allowed a few to do that, R. Lee Ermey's being one of them, which helped show off the brutality of his character, especially to D'Onofrio's Pyle.  In fact, this scene should've gotten him an Oscar nod, same goes for D'Onofrio.  Vincent is able to capture the recruit going from a troubled man, to an insane, creepy, and flawless recruit whose unpredictable in every corner.  The change in D'Onofrio's character shows that people can change even before they go to war (nonviolence anyone?), and that training can have negative implications in them and/or their platoon.  A must-see, especially for anyone who's against war.",

Kubrick's ability to blend moods, specifically within the first 40 minutes, is at an all time high, presenting to us some hilarious yet intense drill instructing from the one and only R. Lee Ermey. On a deeper level, it illustrates the complete deterioration of the troops in the Marine corps to the point of losing their last remaining shreds of humanity, leaving them lifeless, killer husks.

My favorite Vietnam movie is We Were Soldiers, second is Hamburger Hill, and although this movies good, it dosent come close to them in my opinion. The first half of the movie at boot camp was not as good as I expected, and kinda let me down although it was funny, but the second half made up for that. It shows how inhumane war turns soldiers, and is graphic and suspenseful. But the acting isn't great, some lines are poorly written and some things are overdone.  Also I didn't like the scenes where they shoot at the buildings because of how the whole 4 story wall of the building would seem to explode in dust and exploding shells.  And thats not the only thing that largely exaggerated.  Not the best Vietnam war movie but pretty good, and it nice that it includes a rural battle setting, which is a good change from other Vietnam war films.",

Lee Ermey was so believable in the role as a drill instructor...but that's because he use to be one and a lot of his lines are improvised. It's a truly haunting movie and once I tune in my focus never leaves the movie whenever I watch it. It's a truly compelling movie and I don't get why a lot of people say the second half ruins it, I think it adds a lot too it. The soundtrack too is great, especially during the war scenes, their not really what you'd expect to hear in a movie like this and it's just great. It's probably the most realistic Vietnam War movie of the 80's.  It's a really great movie.",

We follow a bunch of new recruits in the American marine core, during the Vietnam war, it opens light heartedly enough, country music highlighting a montage of hair shaving and outstandingly whitty monologues from Lee Emery as the iconic Gunnery Sgt Harmen, howeven soon the trials of war and the pressure and treatment of cadets become too much for some members. Flash forward some time from that and we are stuck with a few of the team as they plough through Vietnam, killing innocents and making videos like superstars. If that seems like a huge leap in synopsis its because this is very much a lop sided film. The first section is tremendous, up there with some of his best work, brilliant cinematography with continual moving shots, give the film a subtle sense of pace and Lee Emery's performance alone with Vincent D'Onofrio totally roll the ball forward, giving us a training session worth remembering. It manages to balance everything right, comedy, brutality and satire all with an underlying disgust as the sequence comes to a brutal conclusion. Kubrick's film then jettisons us forward with little mention of anything prior apart from the characters of Private Joker, Matthew Modine and Private Cowboy, Arliss Howard. Here we the film turns fully satirical, honing in on how biased the american propaganda was that not even their own troops fully understood why they were there, in a round about way summing up what the rest of the world was thinking at the time. It's not that the second half is bad, quite the opposite but put side by side with the first and it is so mismatched you cant help but be jolted out the movie for multiple viewings. It feels almost like the first section should be the entire movie, however with its length, Kubrick feels the need to bundle in the next part, either that or the complete shift in tone is intended to make us feel the way we do. Regardless it is jolting and takes a lot of repeat viewing until getting used to the step. The entire film looks, sounds and illuminates perfectly, the subtle music throughout the piece give a sense of time, pace and emotion, while bookended with iconic, of the time songs. The war torn Vietnam is also outstandingly realized, industrial wastelands strew with fire up the side of buildings as snipers and booby traps lay waste to soldiers, really give a sense of guerilla warfare. Yet the film isnt perfect, the majority of characters are very one note and alienating. This adds a peculiar air to the piece but at times seems a little jarring, there at times seems like there is a little too much filler, the film packs such a punch, however its so prolonged that the effects start to wear off after the hour mark. Its brilliant and fun and diabolical all at the same time, its just not the tightest effort ever committed to cinema, which is a shame because when this film is good, it is really fucking good.",

Kubrick's craft as a director is never more present with his perfectly engineered camera angles and set design. Kubrick made a point to never make the same film twice and in context of some of his other pictures, there are some awe inspiring sequences he pulled off.

            "content": "War is not worth wasting our youth\n\nFull Metal Jacket is about the idea that war is not worth wasting our youth. It tries to prove this with two stories: the first is the marines training for deployment, the second is the marines in action in Vietnam.\n\nThe first story, the marines training for deployment, is told with two external plots: that of the not so bright marine Pyle trying to finish boot camp and the second is the entire class of marines trying to graduate. The class of marines succeed in graduating, but Pyle does not. He goes crazy after the harsh treatment meant to harden him to become a killer and commits suicide. So this story gets to the point that preparing for war is inhumane and not worth wasting our youth.\n\nThe second story is about the marines fighting to win the war in Vietnam. This is told with two plots: that of winning the war and the second of the declining morality of the marines. The war is not won, it ends ambiguously as the marines win a small insignificant battle and return to camp while the morality of the marines shows a constant decline and ends with our hero committing murder.\n\nThe movie is a great testament to the anti-war movement and a visual essay on the meaninglessness of war. But it is not a very engaging story. The first half of the movie makes a tight dramatic point that training marines to be killer has some inhumane consequences and proves it with Pyle's suicide. But the second half doesn't have an overall story arc to hang its hat on. The status of the main external plot of winning the war is left ambiguous. So the moral decline of our hero who has to commit murder at the end doesn't create as much meaning since the murder doesn't get us any further in winning the war.\n\nOne can argue that that's the point of the movie, is that these atrocities are senseless and meaningless. And that is true. But in terms of a dramatic story, the meaning of the action is lost because the filmmakers abhorred making winning the war into any resemblance of a real plot.\n\nIn the first half of the movie, Pyle's suicide is juxtaposed with the success of class of marines all graduating. Thus it makes the point that his suicide is not worth it for us to successfully train marines. But in the second half of the movie, Joker commits murder but this action is not juxtaposed with progression of any other plot. So the action loses the chance to create meaning through a consequence for his actions. It feels like the movie was cut off without any real resolution, like another 15 minutes were missing.\n\nhttp://www.storycharts.ca/story/115042/5898536285634560/Film/Full_Metal_Jacket",

First off I must say I really liked the 1st half of this with the boot camp scenes. R. Lee Ermey is fantastic as Sgt. Hartman and he seriously acts like a hard-nosed drilled sergeant which really helps the performance. The boot camp scenes show the cruel toughness of solider training. However, the psychology with Private Ryan wasn't talked about enough to truly see what he's going through. And one big thing the boot camp scenes could have done was flesh out characters but, it misses out so we barely know these characters and we can't feel symphony for them on what they're going through and that's when the movie goes downhill. The fight scenes are fine but it was hard to give a darn because we barely give a darn about the characters. So I think this movie is alright. But many people have different opinions than I do, so check out this movie and see what you think of it.",

            "content": "Full Metal Jacket is a unique offering in the world of war films: an apolitical two-segmented movie that depicts the dehumanizing training that turns Marine recruits into killers and their subsequent service in the Vietnam War during the Tet Offensive. Add this unique nature with memorable characters and moments as well as an insightful examination of military training and you have an instant classic.\n\nThe film is split in two very distinct portions: training and warfare. The first section depicts potential Marines undergoing brutal training at Parris Island prior to deployment in Vietnam in 1968. Here, the recruits are subject to the whims and desensitizing tactics of their tough drill instructor (portrayed by former USMC Gunnery Sergeant R. Lee Ermey in a legendary performance). After the completion of boot camp, the film changes direction to follow Stars and Stripes reporter \"Joker\" (Matthew Modine) as he takes part in the Tet Offensive and the Battle of Hue City in Vietnam. The first is more famous and slightly better and more engaging than the second, but both are enjoyable and keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nFor me, the film needs to be memorable in order for me to like it AND watch it more than once. That happens due to great characters and unforgettable moments, and Full Metal Jacket provides both. For characters, there is a cast of rough, tough, individual Leathernecks such as independent, duality-loving, combat seeking \"Joker\", well-meaning, slightly dim, overweight \"Gomer Pyle\", nihilistic, aggressive \"Animal Mother\" and several others. What will you remember about this movie? An infamous opening sequence featuring a funny and coarse introduction from Gunny Hartman, a frequently-quoted Vietnamese prostitute, an insensitive, unstable, highly quotable door-gunner, and several profane boot camp cadences, along with many other instances. \n\nThe most powerful theme of Full Metal Jacket (and its difference from other war films) is its study of military indoctrination. In the movie, indoctrination provides two results: successful transformation into a Marine and a killer, or total failure resulting in a psychological time bomb. Joker is the former: he begins as a standout recruit, the one who refuses to hold back his insightful, sardonic comments even at the expense of rebuke or Gunny Hartman's fist and rises to become platoon leader during boot camp. In Vietnam, he is the reporter who wears a helmet saying \"Natural Born Killer\" and a peace symbol and seeks the gritty truth at the behest of his superiors, who want to boost moral even if it means tweaking news headlines. By the end of the film, Joker becomes a combat veteran, witness to the brutality of war and difficult moral decisions and bearing the \"thousand-mile stare\", his mark as a killer. Pyle, on the other hand, finds himself the ultimate target of Hartman's wrath due to his weight and incompetence. His failure throughout boot camp and the constant psychological and physical abuse he endures leads to tragedy for him and the platoon.\n\nFull Metal Jacket is gritty and unflinching, and while not as violent or containing as much combat as other war films, there is brutality nonetheless. However, it is an excellent war film that I consider one of the best out there and one that you will certainly not forget.",

Matthew Modine is in one of his best role, presenting a steadfast young man with the rare quality necessary to get through marine training with all his head. A young Vincent D'Onofrio, almost unrecognizable, gives us a performance of a lifetime with incredible realism. R. Lee Ermey is the quintessential army drill sergeant, a perfect performance. Adam Baldwin plays a shallow role, but gives it his best.\n\nThe bad. Nothing.\n\nThe ugly. Giving loud orders in an echoing building while sneaking on an enemy.

            "content": "War! Huh! What is it good for? Okay, you get the shtick. It was roughly ten years after Vietnam War that the Stanley Kubrick film Full Metal Jacket was released. At this point, two landmark war films about the same war were already released, with universal acclaim: Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now and Oliver Stone's Platoon. Somehow, Kubrick manages to plow out the inevitable comparisons to such films by creating an equally effective war film. Need not worry. The rest of the review will not be answering, \"What makes this so different from the others?\"\nBased on the novel The Short-Timers by Gustav Hasford, the film primarily follows, and is narrated by, a fierce journalist simply known as Joker (Matthew Modine). We witness his, along with various other U.S. Marines', endeavors through boot camp on Parris Island and brutal warfare in 'Nam. Leading the platoon of privates on Parris Island is a no-nonsense (mind you, that is an understatement) drill sergeant known as Hartman (R. Lee Ermey). Among Joker's fellow comrades are Cowboy (Arliss Howard), Snowball (Peter Edmund), and Gomer Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio). Throughout the boot camp process, Hartman trains his men to grow an instinct to kill or retaliate, lest they land themselves into, \"a world of shit.\" Immediately following all training events are the Joker's mishaps in Vietnam with Rafter Man (Kevyn Howard), Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin), Touchdown (Ed O'Ross), and even an old friend from the island. These mishaps range from TV newscasts and Vietnamese hookers to deadly battles with guerrilla fighters and snipers.\nA war film under the two-hour mark is inevitably packing a lot into the punch, and somehow, the whole film comes together remarkably, by the end (which plays out with one of the many hilarious chants sung throughout the film). By the time the Joker is in Vietnam, he bears a peace button and a helmet with the words, \"Born to Kill,\" written on it. When questioned about this combination of attire, the Joker explains that it relates to the duality of man. This duality of man is the essence upon that the entire film touches. Understand that, during Vietnam War, not every soldier volunteered for the job. The draft forced hundreds of thousands of U.S. civilians to throw away their lives in order to kill for peace. What a joke, that is. Joker, perhaps one of the many who was drafted, decided to make a social statement by wearing both the button and the helmet. That is one example of many in the film, where writer and director Stanley Kubrick throws just enough pieces of the puzzle at you, for you to conceive of the rest through some thought. Again, it is a remarkable job on Kubrick's part.\nMatthew Modine gives as much as the film allows him to give for his performance as Joker. He is clearly caught in this duality of man throughout the entire film, in instances such as wailing a wrapped bar of soap on Pyle's belly to nobly burying or killing those of any side of the battle. While most of the soldiers have had their minds wiped clean of any morality, Joker still has a tight grip on the peaceful side of man. Admittedly, most of these perceptions are given by how Kubrick shot and wrote certain scenes, but Modine does well in those instances where a normal soldier would act on his instinct, while instead he stands, almost stunned by his uncertainty on which side of the duality to follow.\nOther Marines, such as Adam Baldwin and Arliss Howard, play their parts with passable conviction, but the two actors who truly stand out from the film are Vincent D'Onofrio and R. Lee Ermey. You may have heard that the boot camp scenes are much stronger than all that follows. In terms of overall power, I cannot concur, but acting-wise, I would absolutely agree. Without giving too much away, these two solely have more screen time than Joker does during the training process (which occupies a little under half of the film's duration). As previously mentioned, Sergeant Hartman does not put up with anyone's bullshit. He will squeeze your testicles until they pop and grow into bigger, stronger ones. Here is my personal favourite Hartman quip, which Ermey improvised: \"I bet you're the kind of guy who'd fuck a guy in the ass and not even have the goddamn common courtesy to give him a reach around.\" You do not fuck with Hartman. To be fair, R. Lee Ermey was a retired drill instructor who eventually landed the role of Hartman, after working as a technical advisor for the film. He was perfect for the role and it certainly showed.\nMeanwhile, Vincent D'Onofrio plays Leonard 'Gomer Pyle,' a slow-witted private clearly not cut to be a Marine. More likely a draftee than anyone else, he nevertheless tries to follow by the rules, but never consistently does so. One small mistake results in Hartman spraying his saliva all over Leonard's face and humiliating Leonard while the rest of the soldiers do extra labour. The tension between Leonard and Hartman grows stronger and stronger as the film progresses, even when Leonard discovers his knack as a rifleman. D'Onofrio, a character actor, plays simple-mindedness so tenderly. For every mistake that Leonard makes, you cannot help but pity him because D'Onofrio did not mean it! Maybe the actor's strength does not truly shine until the last scene on Parris Island, which recalls the best scenes of Jack Torrence in The Shining, another classic Kubrick film.\nWhat an awesome movie. I did not stress this earlier, but what makes the film so effective in wrenching your guts is the dramatic transitions between grim descents into madness and disparity, and lighthearted shenanigans among friends. Kubrick is having fun with the idea of a war film. He is not there to talk simply about the duality of man. The Marine Corps is not all about killing for peace. If it were not for art pieces like this film, those who never joined any branch of the military would not really understand the family element of the Marine Corps. The chants stick with you from boot camp to the worst days of warfare, and while you're trying to save your ass, wasting anyone or anything that gets in your way, these songs will keep your hopes high. While your soul may be dead, your spirit will still be alive.",

We follow Joker from basic and when we see him in Vietnam he meets back up with one of his friends from basic. From there it's a little random with two firefights that break out and then the end.

Contrapuntal music was used exquisitely at the most appropriate pin-points within the film, perhaps making the film more enjoyable yet aesthetically intriguing when juxtaposed next to the brutality of war. Story seemed better and much stronger in earlier stages of film, as I really cared more of the outcome of the first part, in comparison to the second part. Laurence in particular, struck a chord which plucked violently in a penultimate scene - as you really build up a weird empathy while in training process, but a subtle twist begins to lurk underneath, which made him the most interesting character, in the most interesting part of the film, as no other war-flick has delved into this side of the pre-war quite like Full Metal Jacket. Great Film.",

Master film maker Stanley Kubrick brings to life a haunting vision of a war both physically and mentally. This film was also the final in a string of excellent films showcasing the Vietnam war from The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now and Platoon. \n\nThe Deer Hunter focused on the emotional side, Apocalypse Now on the psychological side and Platoon on the true to life real physical events. This film brilliantly blends all of these together for one of the definitive motion picture experiences of the 1980's.  Kubrick's precision direction helps bring out the truth to humanity's deadly nature from the hard knock bootcamp of marine trainee's in the film's first half to the deadly battle ground that was Vietnam in 1968. \n\nThe film's first half within the boot camp is a truly deep and traumatic experience showcasing what can happen to a man when he is pushed to far and eventually just breaks. That man was brilliantly played by Vincent D'Onofrio first as a mere happy go lucky overweight marine in training, but due to his lack of skill is pushed and psychologically broken by his peers to the point of committing murder and suicide in the haunting nighttime washroom scene.\n\nThe film's main protagonist however was played by Matthew Modine also giving an excellent performance as 'Joker' the marine who claims he is \"Born to Kill\" however it may merely be an attempt to look like a badass as this claim is truly put to the test upon entering the battle grounds of Vietnam. His character is also psychologically evolving from the boot camp to the war but he learns to face fear and conquer it and to become not afraid.\n\nKubrick put together some of the most excellent war sequences I have seen on film. And unlike previous 'Nam films rather than this being a jungle ambush warfare style war film he took the film to the streets and civilized areas. This film is truly a classic film on all levels and one that has left a lasting impression on cinema, it is haunting, groundbreaking, dramatic, action packed and pure Kubrick.",

But, it's still one of the best Vietnam war films ever made, and despite what some people say, the second half of the film in Vietnam is just as powerful as the explosive first part. In Parris Island in North Carolina in 1967, a group of privates including Joker (Matthew Modine), Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio) and Cowboy (Arliss Howard) are placed under the command of Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey), who is brutal and draconian. He particually picks on the bumbling Pyle, who can't seem to anything right, but just as it looks like Pyle is starting to show improvement, he goes psycho. A few months later, Joker is in Vietnam and writing for Stars and Stripes magazine, and he is sent from Da Nang up to Hue just in time for the Tet Offensive, and there he's reunited with Cowboy and he meets the gung-ho Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin). Kubrick would famously not travel outside the UK, so his Vietnam ranges from Sussex and Norfolk to the Docklands or London, and it's bloody convincing too. He gets the best out of his cast, and he handles the action scenes well, with the climactic battle being bloody and quite suspenseful.",

            "content": "Kubrick surprisingly only made two films in the 80s . His follow up to The Shining, well-made as it is, is not without certain flaws and is by no means top-drawer Kubrick. However, it is punctuated with incredible moments in spite of its shortcomings, including a grueling opening-act which details marine training at Parris Island and ends with a hair-raising showdown between a grunt and a gunnery sergeant. Also, the film's bloody climax, with its inconclusive clash between the American forces and an enemy sniper, is simultaneously tense, frightening, ironic and meaningless.\n\nThe story (taken from Gustav Hasford's novel The Short-Timers) opens with a bunch of green marine recruits undergoing military training at Parris Island. The drill instructor Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey) is a ruthless, motor-mouthed loony who relentlessly humiliates and desensitizes his boys, so that when he has finally stripped them of their humanity he can rebuild them as single-minded killing machines. Among the bunch is happy-go-lucky Private Joker (Matthew Modine), and the vaguely ridiculous (and ridiculed) Private Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio). As the recruits near the end of their grueling training regime, Pyle finally cracks under the strain and kills the gunnery sergeant, before turning his gun on himself. The action jumps forward to find Joker on a tour of duty in Vietnam. He is by this point a military journalist who has seen some pretty unpleasant sights during his time in 'Nam (and is divided by his experiences - notice his Born To Kill helmet and his Peace buttoned jacket). The platoon he is part of becomes involved in a street battle in the ruins of Hue City near the film's climax, where they find themselves pinned down and picked off by a female Vietcong sniper. Finally, after much panic and bloodshed, darkness falls and the marines retreat into the night singing the Mickey Mouse March.\n\nWhere Kubrick really hits his target is in his depiction of the emotional change within Modine's character, and in his cold and cynical (and authentic) view of the dehumanization that results from being subjected to warfare. Women and children become acceptable targets for the gun-toting soldiers; fear of death gives way to callous indifference; violence becomes normal; horrific deaths and injuries become commonplace to the point of disinterest. No-one in the film can remember the cause they're fighting for or, if they can, they never refer to it. It's just one side versus the other, locked in a costly, savage stalemate, as they enter into violent engagements simply because it's expected of them. The lack of real location work is a problem - Kubrick wouldn't film outside England, so the final gun exchange in Hue City was actually shot in a disused London factory yard, complete with imported palm trees. Also, the film is so intentionally detached from compassion that it becomes hard to relate to anyone in the film. While we're supposed to be shocked by the utter indifference with which people are killed or injured during warfare, the total refusal to present a glimmer of feeling or sympathy makes the film's second half as icily distant as it is bloodthirsty. \n\nFull Metal Jacket is certainly powerful and potent, but it really is a tale of two halves. Kubrick's specificity in examining the psychology of the solider is so unrelenting and, dare I say militant; the second half doesn't have the same urgency, which leaves the viewer with a sense of deflation.",

Private\"Joker\" -played by Matthew Modine, and Private \"Pyle\", as in Gomer Pyle, played by the brilliant Vince D'Onofrio. It's a chilling portrayal of the realities of war, but a masterful interpretation of a soldiers life in the Marine Corps. Even though \"Joker\" is a journalist, he arms himself with an M16 and fights back against Vietnam insurgents, in what is a scene that seems to bring back an element so familiar in Akira Kurosawa films. That wide, anticipating shot, that proves to be an effective way to keep the audience in suspense. \n\nAll in all, this is a perfect war film.

Basically the movie is split up into two different sections; the first following the young volunteers at boot camp, ran by an absolutely stellar performance by R. Lee Ermey, who is in fact a drill instructor in real life. The second half being in Vietnam during the war, where you get some great action footage, along with a taste of what Kubrick thought the war was like when the men weren't risking their lives on the battlefield. You have to mark down Ermey's performance as insanely great and realistic, along with the rest of the cast which includes a very young group of actors that nail their performances as soldiers in training. The storyline is great, and the acting is superb. You don't get a whole lot of action until the final 45 minutes to an hour of the film, but let me tell you, it is intense war action. Notably one of the most watched and loved war films, and it should be. If you have never seen this film, you need to, it definitely set the bar for war films to follow. 4.5/5 JD",

One character that is the 'vessel' for the film is Pvt. \"Gomer Pyle\" whose short life in the film is a testament to both Kubrick's psychotic storytelling and the rapid mental decay of an alienated killer that is eerie and haunting, but vividly true. Kubirck, Herr and Hasford's script is impeccably detailed, memorable, skillful and witty while the action is thrilling and close-range. The ending is pessimistic, powerful but at the same time strange and bizzare and holds the film to consistent last note. Full Metal Jacket is Stanley Kubrick's most audacious film as he directs the scenes and music to have instant tonal shifts that represent the real confusion and psychosis that surrounded the real war. But aside from its messages, the first half hour solidifies the recurring humour (I mean its 10 whole minutes of all-out insults that were completely off-script) and black comedy that is the best parts of the film.",

We see the conditions troops are faced with in boot camp and on the battlefield and how war turns into hell, but mainly we follow the squadron of Private Joker (Matthew Modine) and how he tries to keep his buddy Private Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio) alive in boot camp, and then serving his duty as journalist in the war. The plot is pretty basic for a war film, but it's executed greatly, though the first half is way better. \n\nACTING:The acting is awesome. Modine does a great job as Joker and D'Onofrio does a brilliant job of Pyle. I can feel the change that takes place in Pyle during his boot camp days. Other great performances were R. Lee Ermey as Sgt. Hartman, Adam Baldwin as Animal Mother, and Kevin Howard as Rafterman.\n\nSCORE:The score was mainly cheesy 80s music and military songs, but they seemed to fit the moods just well.\n\nCAMERAWORK:This had some of Kubrick's famous camerawork in it, but not much.\n\nOTHER CONTENT:This had most of Kubrick's best perks and feels in it, but I can tell what people mean when they say that it's overrated. You can't feel Kubrick's presence in here as much as some of his other works; in fact, if not for the first half of the film, it would have been just another war movie that no one would've acknowledged as anything more than generic, Oscar-bait. It's still a great film, but it just doesn't live up to the potential Kubrick had.\n\nOVERALL,a great Kubrick film with a greatly executed plot, awesome acting, fitting score, classic Kubrick camerawork, and a great first half, but without the first half, the movie would've been pretty bland.",

Joker where we witness again the brutality and absolute horror of war this time on the battle field through death, sacrifice, and bloody vengeance. Although my opinion is that this film is so skillfully captivating on both parts, the first part of the film is simply more interesting, cohesive, and shocking to the viewer. That being said, this film is another undeniable classic film from Kubrick and a war film I would strongly recommend to anyone.",

As a \"cinephile\" my choice was to endure them only once, just to know what one of the most overrated directors in the history of cinema was up to. I duly watched FMJ at the time of its original release and did not enjoy it. Back then it felt like a late arrival, saying nothing new after Apocalypse Now and Platoon. Devoid of the emotional impact of those two other movies, dry, slow-paced and boring.\n\nLast night, I stumbled upon it on TV and out of curiosity I decided to give it another try, should my previous impression been marred by youthful ignorance. Alas not... In fact, years of movie-watching just enhanced my dislike for what looks more than ever like an half-baked, over simplistic war movie.\n\nAs everybody knows, FMJ is basically two movies stuck together, with little relation to each other. The first half takes place during a brutal boot camp, with lots of shouting and humiliation from a sadist drill sergeant, leading to \"tragic events\" of some sort. The second half takes place in Great Britain, standing for Vietnam and failing miserably at the task.\n\nIn no way the cold, gray UK could be mistaken for a sub-tropical country. In FMJ the actors keep their long sleeves down, no sticky heat, profuse sweating or ventilators flapping. \n\nBesides being infamous for its fake, chilling location, the second part is almost ludicrous in every other aspect. From the dialogues, which sound like a parody of macho war movies, but are in no way funny, to character non-development, to sexist use of local prostitutes - not once, but twice.\n\nWe are shown twice what is basically the same scene (and the only female presence in the movie): a young Viet prostitute soliciting Joker and friends. Same scene some 15 minutes later, only this time the prostitute is pimped out by a local guy.\n\nI could ask many questions about this movieâ¦ For instance if Kubrick was supposed to be over-meticulous and detail crazy how did he missed the fact that the UK does not look like Vietnam? How did he missed the fact that he has the same scene twice in the movie? etc...\n\nIn the poster's photo we have a helmet with \"Born to kill\" scribbled next to a peace sign, signifying the duplicity of human nature. This convey the full message you should get at the end of the movie, so you can spare yourself some time just taking a good look at the poster. If you want to add an additional layer of \"meaning\", perhaps you can infer that mankind (in the shape of main character Joker) is \"naturally\" good but can be trained to become \"bad\". Hardly a brand-new, mind-blowing concept.",

On the first viewing, the film's dual narrative baffles, and when it moves to Vietnam, the viewer is left yearning the first half's brilliant dark humor and R. Lee Ermey's incredibly intense performance (his frenetic opening monologue will never be outdone). But on further viewings the film's intentions become clearer, and rewards the audience. Kubrick was always interested more in ideas than characters (2001 being the perfect example), but Full Metal Jacket gives much space for the characters as well, and in time you learn to feel empathy towards them. While the film is complex, multi-layered, filled with great performances and near-perfect, the duality of the narrative still remains a bit strange, making it feel like Kubrick actually made two films and just blended them together, but not seamlessly enough. But as a whole this is still a great achievement and one of the best war films of all time.",

Philosophical debate about whether the individual right to violence, the dehumanization of society, where people turned into a submissive creature began Kubrick in the movie \"A Clockwork Orange.\" The theme of the individual as a puppet in the hands of the History of Rock and unknown, was present in one way or another, in his next tape \"Barry Lyndon\" and \"The Shining.\"\n\nCirculation director for the novel \"About living\" Gustav Hesforda about the Vietnam War, on the one hand, it was natural, and on the other - is not so essential. And the fact that Stanley Kubrick chose to recreate all the fights not the Asian kind, and in specially constructed scenery in England, shows not on his whim, desire comfortably and slowly think through complex panorama camera and driveways, almost rhythmically organized pyrotechnics simulating explosions . Director wanted in the first place, to create his image of the Apocalypse on Earth that would be different, for example, koppolovskogo in the film \"Apocalypse Now,\" also tells the story of Vietnam.\n\nFor Kubrick - is just one of the soldiers (we can recall that back in 1958 he made a truly impressive film \"Paths of Glory,\" the soldiers of the First World), only a special case in history, instead of which could be any other example of mass inhumanity, of the mechanical work on the destruction of people. \"Born to Kill\" - this is the inscription on the helmets of the young marines who first pass drill under wild Sergeant Hartman at Parris Island. System teaches killing, suggesting that it was not otherwise possible to survive the war. The second half of the tape powerfully argues that in a general massacre of humanoid creatures that are already in place as well-developed and adjusted to each other part of the infernal machine, like a bullet placed in Full Metal Jacket, no one can rely on the fact that survive until dawn, or even the next minute. Born to kill automatically becomes destined for death.",

The funny thing with this movie is how Stanley Kubrick delved into more harshness and the making of the hard boiled military machine for those who could hack it and those who fought against it, but basically became elite killers. The acting is good, story riveting, shocking, and also depressing, so not for the feint of heart.

The performances are brilliant and Kubrick again uses long shots making the scenes more engaging.

We never know what's waiting for them or what lives they want to lead. We never see them as humans. There is character development in FMJ but where are the human qualities that bring characters to life. \n\nThe first half is a visceral experience, the punishment and brainwashing of the marines is provocative, and the minute goes by quickly. Two characters drive this act, their relationship is one that develops and verges on trust, the whole time Leonard is becoming the \"killer\" Gunnery Sgt. Hartman want him to be while simultaneously being brainwashed. The devastating affect the process has on Leonard leads him to kill himself and the Gunnery Sgt. Here Kubrick is telling us about the harsh transformation of an ordinary man who becomes a killer, it's an unnatural transformation. Leonard's arc is a metaphor for how unnatural war is as a whole, especially for the human mind. Kubrick isn't just telling us war is a bad thing, it's an abnormal thing. The repeated marches suggest the monotony of the craft, perhaps the mindless repetition plays a part in the solder's alienation.\n\nThe second  half is a grand mess, it has no emotional resonance nor structure. For a director is renowned for precise planning, Kubrick's genius is absent in the second half. It's completely disorganized and without an objective. \n\nThe first half is enough to carry the film to a positive rating, for it has substance and style, both evenly balanced. There's a beautiful silhouette of the solder's climbing an obstacle, and the imposing Gunnery Sgt. Hartman is too charismatic to ignore. The second half is very disappointing, Kubrick obviously tries to maintain his themes but they are too enigmatic. The audience has nothing to care about.",

Full Metal Jacket is perhaps his most condemning of war and it may be his most effective and believable since Fear and Desire. It's easy to think that its specific setting in a war where the soldiers don't have a grip on reality, treating it like a holiday, and the locals are debased by the fighting on their soil is unique to the Vietnam War. However, while it may be an effective critique of that debacle, it is a strong polemic against all war and more generally, its indictment is of anyone who glorifies a lack of compassion. It is this that the film satirizes, especially in the boot camp that tries to take away agency and free will. And satire it is; often as much a caricature as Dr. Strangelove and as exaggerated as A Clockwork Orange. Our only heroes are those who strain to maintain a sense of humanity and it provides a fitting bookend, not only to the film, but to Kubrick cinematic career, that the last act shown is someone regaining his sense of agency in the small way left available to him.",

To me, the first half was enjoying, and the second half was a masterpiece. In other words, it was art. I also loved how it used a better equipment to make the movie look good other than that crappy CGI like most people uses in other thrilling movies.

From phenomenal direct Stanley Kubrick, we get Full Metal Jacket, a realistic portrayal of the Tet Offensive, the turning point of the Vietnam War.  The movie, without a doubt, is a two-halfer.  The second half is an accurate look into the Tet Offensive's impact on the war, but ends on a strange note (probably because Kubrick is so strange).  But the first half of the movie?  GREATEST 45-50 MINUTES IN FILM HISTORY.  The vulgar dialogue, the emotion, the camera angles.......everything is spot-on.  R. Lee Ermey's portrayal as the stringent Sgt. Hartman is one of film's most interesting and humorous performances to ever hit the big screen.  Every little line that Ermey spits out of his mouth is guaranteed laughter.  Altogether, this is a fantastic production that is worth the watch; it is easily one of Kubrick's finest works.\n4.5 out of 5 stars",

            "content": "This is one of the best war (or anti-war) films that I have seen. It is a tale told in two parts. In the first part we follow green recruits as they go through basic training on Parris Island. It is the first part of the story that introduces us to two truly unforgettable characters: Drill Instructor Hartman is a terrifying figure who uses both verbal and physical abuse to mold his men into Marines. Hartman is superbly played by real-life ex-Marine R. Lee Ermey, and not a single word of his seems fake or contrived. The second unforgettable character is Pvt. Leonard Lawrence, better known as Pyle. From the first time you see him on screen you get the feeling that something isn't right. The overweight recruit takes the worst of Hartman's abuse, is humiliated, betrayed by a friend and finally completely broken down until he becomes the picture of quiet madness. The first part of the story ends with a shocking act of violence that shows what can happen when you ask ordinary men to become killing machines.The second part of the story finds Joker (the character who narrates the film) in Vietnam, now a Sergeant and a writer for Stars and Stripes. His job is not as much about reporting the truth as it is about boosting morale. Joker is a walking contradiction, a Marine who wears a peace button, yet has \"BORN TO KILL\" written on his helmet. In this part of the story we meet another memorable character, Animal Mother, an unbalanced individual who while standing over the bodies of two fallen comrades says without emotion, \"Better you than me\". The last shots of Marines marching through fiery ruins while singing the Mickey Mouse Club theme song could best be described as haunting. If war is hell, then these are the damned.A great script, great cinematography, a solid cast and a good soundtrack all brought together by a great director. This film stands above all other Vietnam War movies, rivaled only by Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now. Full Metal Jacket is a film that everyone should see at least once, although it retains it's power even after repeated viewings. A truly great film",

Pyle in the bathroom scene. Simply put, the boot camp sequence is one of the best individual movie sequences of all time.\n\nThe combat part, while not as good, is still fun enough to watch.

However, and there is the director's beloved use of symbolic icons which were sometimes blatant, and sometimes very subtle.\n\nKubrick's eye for cinematography shines once again, along with some outstanding camera work, usually answering questions a viewer may ask when something within the frame is noticed. This goes as well for the more blatant symbolic icons.\n\nWhile the musical score is scarce (though silence of course adds to the excitement of the intense scenes), it's a great score when it does get put to use.\n\nThis is another successful movie by Kubrick, and while it perhaps isn't my personal favorite, it is undeniably fantastic and maybe even near-flawless.",

In Full Metal Jacket, the narrative is strong, subversive, terrorist, violent, intimidating, \"forces\", \"involving\" and \"start\" sensory experiences in a mental process immediate and concrete. And 'with these realities that man, master and prey of their senses must necessarily be measured. E ', the same man who loses his gender-biased to rise and transmigrate to the Subject / History - The protagonist / narrator. So I understand. Kubrick does not like to present itself often, is the 1980 Shining, Full Metal Jacket in 1987. Seven years, seven long years, but why? Because, probably, the \"Monolith\" needs time to add a new / true piece movie universe. I like to think that all of Kubrick's work, has pledged to defend a eusociality pestered with micro / macro economic Powers / politicians. The film. The instructor Gerheim protagonist of the novel \"The Short-Timers\" by Gustav Hasford referenced Kubrick, is transformed into the fearsome Sergeant Hartman Ronald Lee Ermey /. Who Hartman? Remember the '\"I Want You for U.S. Army?\" With the index pointing Uncle Sam? Well, Hartman is the son of that idea degenerated. (Hartman who are out there?) It 'a military instructor was born to destroy the human personality with appurtenances. It 'so good as to become a victim of its own \"royalties\". Following Pyle will make a wonderful essay by the lessons learned from Hartman. And 'assisted in this performance by the famous 7.62 caliber Full Metal Jacket! In the second part of the film is to tell the soldier Joker mistakes / horrors of an army in disarray. Many scenes are strong and many truths still shrouded in mystery / So, Kubrick offers his reflections to the public and it does work pouring in severity, technicality, fussiness. How much did the fight against communism? I do not know. One thing I know. Many soldiers could not tell the Song Huong the perfume river / as many children of the same bank of the river have not yet achieved. Luckiness!\r\n\r\nITALIAN VERSION\r\n\r\nSông Hương \\ il fiume dei profumi /\r\n\r\nI lavori di Stanley Kubrick proiettano lo spettatore, inevitabilmente ed aggiungo fortunatamente,  in realtà storico-temporali certe, vere, propositive, prive di mistificazioni e se aggiungo dinamitarde sotto tutti i punti di vista,  non penso di essere lontano dalla sua \"mente\". In Full Metal Jacket la narrazione è forte, sovversiva, terroristica, violenta, intimidatoria; \"obbliga\", \"coinvolge\" ed \"inizia\" le esperienze sensoriali in un processo mentale immediato e concreto. E' con queste realtà che l'uomo, padrone e preda dei propri sensi deve necessariamente misurarsi. E', sempre lo stesso uomo, che perde la sua connotazione di genere per assurgere e trasmigrare in Soggetto/Storia -  Protagonista/Narratore. Così mi par di capire.\r\n\r\nKubrick non ama proporsi spesso, Shining è del 1980, Full Metal Jacket è del 1987. Sette anni; sette lunghissimi anni, ma perché? Perché, probabilmente, il \"Monolite\" ha bisogno di tempo per aggiungere un nuovo / vero tassello all'universo cinema. Mi piace pensare che tutta l'opera di Kubrick, è impegnata a  difendere una Eusocialità continuamente minacciata da micro/macro Poteri economico/politici.\r\n\r\nIl film.\r\n\r\nL'istruttore Gerheim protagonista del romanzo \"The Short-Timers\" di Gustav Hasford a cui fa riferimento Kubrick, si trasforma nel temibile Sergente Maggiore Hartman \\ Ronald Lee Ermey /. Chi è Hartman? Ricordate l' \"I want you for U.S. Army?\" con l'indice dello Zio Sam puntato? Bene, Hartman è figlio degenero di quell'idea. (quanti Hartman ci sono in giro?) E' un militare istruttore nato per distruggere la personalità umana con annessi e connessi. E' talmente bravo da diventare vittima dei suoi stessi \"canoni\".\r\n\r\nIn seguito Palla di Lardo darà un meraviglioso saggio di quanto imparato da Hartman. E' coadiuvato in questa performance da una calibro 7.62 la famosa Full Metal Jacket!\r\n\r\nNella seconda parte del film è il sodato Joker a narrare gli errori/orrori di un esercito allo sbando. \\ Molte scene sono forti e molte verità ancora avvolte nel mistero / Dunque, Kubrick propone le sue riflessioni al pubblico e lo fa riversando nel lavoro severità, tecnicismo, pignoleria. \r\n\r\nQuanto è costata la lotta al comunismo? Io non lo so. Una cosa la so. Tanti soldati non hanno potuto raccontare del Sông Hương \\ il fiume dei profumi / così come tanti bimbi la riva dello stesso fiume non  l'hanno mai raggiunta.\r\n\r\nLuckiness!",

The basic training sequences focus upon the brutal mentoring of Sgt. Hartman (R. Lee Ermey) and the slow-burning madness of Pvt. Pile (Vincent D'Onofrio). That part is eerily brilliant, but once the war scenes begin all the interesting characters are taken away from us. What remains is a group of ciphers who dully clunk around without a semblance of narrative or theme to make the viewer care about what happens to them.",

Lee Ermey or Vincent D'Onofrio should have won the academy award for best supporting actor because they were so intense and shocking in their forty minutes on screen that they become the greatest part of the film, especially considering R.

            "content": "Full Metal Jacket is a classic movie about the Vietnam War. It is made by Stantley Kubrick, my personal favorite director, and therefore has many of Kubrick's trademark styles. The movie (for me, at least) consists of three parts. The first part is about the marine's  boot camp. The second part is all of the action and battles in Vietnam. The third part is about the main character's battle with a lone sniper hidden in a building.\nPart one is definitely where the movie shines. The boot camp scenes are the undisputed best scenes in the movie. Kubrick really gets to display and showcase his incredible talent as a director. Examples are how there's perfect symmetry with the beds and the footlockers in the men's rooms. It's so perfect, it's practically jaw-dropping. We also get to meet Drill Sgt. Hartman. He's so over-the-top and hillarious that you can't help to get sucked into the movie. Vietnam veterans that saw this movie and said that the boot camp scenes were incredibly realistic.\nPart two doesn't live up to the perfection of part one. In part two, Full Metal Jacket turns into an average war movie. Kubrick shows off less of his skills in part two, and several montages of battles are shown. It's still great action and well-directed, but it's dissapointing to see such a wonderful movie become so..average.\nPart three is the last thirty minutes of the movie. Kubrick's talent is able to shine again in this part. Every shot by the sniper becomes very cinematic, and is shown in slow-motion. This gives the movie a more gritty and grueling feel. You can almost feel the pain that the soldier's feel when they struck by the bullets. The ending of the movie is very satisfying and shows that this is more than your average war movie.\nIn summary, Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket is a very well-made movie. It's a classic that is very thrilling and very fun to watch. I'd recommend this movie to anyone that is interesting in war movies or the Vietnam War itself.",

            "content": "Full Metal Jacket is often described as 'uneven'.  I agree.  On the whole, many (re)viewers consider the first act meticulous, the second aimless, and the third farcical (or adjectives to similar effect).  I have no issue with such assessments.  Occasionally, a review will tie these observations together and make the assertion that Stanley Kubrick lost his way and made a total mess of the movie.  That's where I have to disagree.\r\n\r\nKubrick was nothing if not an extremely competent filmmaker.  Others might be rightly accused of ineptitude, but in his films, the absence (or presence) of anything onscreen is unquestionably intentional.\r\n\r\nIn that light, I see the first act (the Parris Island training) as an indoctrination not only for the draftees, but for the audience.  At the end of the training we, like Joker and company, will be prepared for what's to come.  We'll have 'squared our shit away' in an organized fashion, and our constitution will be a clear, highly polished, meticulously crafted reconstruction of our former naive perspective.  At the end of the training, our inner child (Pyle) will be dead, along with the architect of our re-creation (Hartman), whose continued presence would stand in the way of claiming this new vision as our own.\r\n\r\nThe irony of the second act is that our newly sharpened senses are focused on the ambiguous mess that is the lot of a correspondent in Da Nang.  While a perfectly serviceable war rages all around, we're sentenced to a menial existence taking handshake shots for the newspapers, chasing 'bush' shots at USO shows, and coming up with clever articles carefully crafted to convey just the right impression about what's going on around us.  Danger consists of a negotiation with a hooker going wrong, and we yearn for a chance to 'get out in the shit' and do what we came here to do.\r\n\r\nWar comes to town in the third act in the form of the Tet Offensive, and finally we can get down to the mission we've come to conduct.  It's a cheat, though, and we learn that in the business of war there are no winners, no losers, no glory, no real indignity, and especially no John Wayne on point to lead us to victory, just the slogging and the grinding and the merciless pounding of war like a sledgehammer on the anthill we inhabit.\r\n\r\nAll our preparation has been for naught.  It was all pointless.  And that's where I so often find myself with Kubrick's movies.\r\n\r\nBy removing the last chapter of Anthony Burgess's original novella, Kubrick cheats Alex of an epilogue in which he abandons his destructiveness, and leaves him a deterministic psychopath.  Kubrick's Jack Torrance arrives at the Overlook Hotel unbalanced and spirals into a fatalistic void, bereft of the good nature Stephen King imbues him with at the start of his novel, and denied the redemption he achieves at its end.\r\n\r\nKubrick didn't even have to tailor the original content in this case.  Hasford's 'Short Timers' came as ready-made grist for the nihilistic mill that would become Full Metal Jacket.  A reliable source can be quoted as saying there is no point.  Their observations of life's horrendous insensibility prove it.  Nothing you can conjure, let alone accomplish, will make any difference.\r\n\r\nSeems a bit sterile to me.  I'm not saying the movie should have been made to my order, but it would have been nice if it'd said something!  As it stands, not even the film is aspiring to overcome the futility of it all, which in my mind absolves me of any responsibility for investing the effort in  it.\r\n\r\nSo at the end of it all, Full Metal Jacket is like the prettiest present under the tree, wrapped most meticulously in the most beautiful paper and adorned with the most impressive bow.  After all the excitement of unwrapping it, however, it's just an empty box, and even THAT (as near as I can tell) isn't supposed to mean anything.",

That's because on first viewing of Full Metal Jacket, you will be very puzzled about what just happened, but on a second you won't be worried about story and you can sit back and appreciate the quality of the film.\r\n\r\nAs many of you may know, this film is split very distinctly in two halves.  The first being basic training for new marines, and the second being an excerpt from Joker's service around the time of the Tet Offensive.\r\n\r\nThe first half is generally everyone's favorite, because it represents what war can do to someone even before they reach battle.  Also, of course, because of Sergeant Hartman, brilliantly portrayed by R. Lee Ermey.  While many would like to credit Kubrick's story for this part, I feel that at least 75% of it's greatness is owed to Ermey, as he either wrote or improvised every line of his dialogue.  This part of the film creates a complex emotional mood, as Hartman gives the audience laughs mixed with sudden anxiety and grief due to the things he says to his recruits.  Also, some will laugh at lines others don't such as when he tells Private Pyle \"if God wanted you at the top of that wall he would've miracled your ass up there.\"  \r\n\r\nIt's a very valid argument to say that this half could have been a movie by itself, if extended to show more scenes of recruits on downtime, etc.  However, I feel that this would have detracted from the mood.  The engrossing nature of this part of the film is due mainly to the feeling that the marines are always training, and are relentlessly under the pressuring watch of Sergeant Hartman.\r\n\r\nThe second half of the film shows a portion of Joker's service, which is initially relaxed but is quickly interrupted by the Tet Offensive.  This portion attempts to represent what being at war was like, even if it isn't in the absolute worst part of battle.\r\n\r\nSo why is the movie split, and why will it probably seem a bit unsatisfying on the first viewing?  Because it wasn't meant to be a Hollywood version of Vietnam, but rather the real version.  I originally thought this movie was far fetched, but I've since learned that it is one of the most accurate depictions ever made.  A friend of mine's father, who fought in Vietnam, couldn't watch FMJ because it was too real.  I also had a neighbor who confirmed the attitude of the film, that a soldier is (or at least was) trained to think nothing of taking human life.  It's you or him, so you better shoot straight and not think about it.  That's what this film is really about:  dehumanization to the point that killing is just like steering left to keep from running off the road.",

It starts at the USMC's 1st act of civilian deconstruction, moves to boot camp, then to war itself. However, Kubrick adds slight subtleties of the human that remains inside the \"killer\" throughout the film.\r\nAs well, the soundtrack is infused with the late 60's and early 70's popular music as well as ominous instrumentals that is heard during the film's most dark and white-knuckled moments.\r\nYou can definitely see influences from \"Full Metal Jacket\" in other war movies that followed this brilliant film. I know I may piss some people off by saying this but this may be Kubrick's best.",

            "content": "A deep look into the making of an American soldier. Full Metal Jacket tells the story about two recruits that serve training in an island during the Vietnam War. Gunnery Sergeant Hartman is the island drill instructor whom has a no bullshit policy and makes all the best soldiers he can, but Private Leonard Lawrence seems as slow-witted and can't learn the basics of discipline. So what does the instructor do? Punish the rest of the soldiers until the slow-witted Private becomes a better soldier. This causes the rest of the team to tackle him one night which makes the Private more disciplined but Private James Davis (the narrator) sees a mental breakdown which may costs him his life. \r\nThe film is an excellent tale of how soldiers are stripped down from everything to make them perfect little robots. I seriously love the first half of this movie because is a drama about how low can the human consciousness can go towards brainwashing. I love the scene in which the drill instructor screams at the camera, you won't feel, you won't cry because it shows how much pressure you can put to a human being that may lead to a mental breakdown like it happened to Private Leonard. The performances were freaking epic in this movie.  The one whom stole the show in this movie was R. Lee Ermey as the drill instructor because he was so hard-core in this performance, so damn serious. I'm amazed he said the phrase, \"I grouch out you eyeball and skull f*** you!\" without any hesitation. The performance of Private Lawrence by Vincent D'Onofrio was really scary and thought provocative. I seriously low the scene in which the drill instructor makes the rest of the soldiers, except for the private, make push-ups simply for the private's incompetence. It shows how cruel the training system can be because you are not punishing the person whom you should punish. I love the other private's story in which he train to maintain his sanity through all the shit he has to go through this war. The film is about not just about the Vietnam War, but about the morale battles this soldiers are going through inside their head in order to be alive in more than one way. The climax of this movie was freaking epic because it shows how much apathy we can show to our enemies even when the enemy is gunned down, it shows that in war there are neither heroes nor villains just a lot of things that we don't need in this world. I like the symbolism the Private puts on a peace sign and a born to be killed on his helmet, showing the duality and complexity man can be in this world. \r\nNow the problem I had with this movie is that they were telling two stories at the same time. The first half of the movie looked like a drama, but the second half of the movie is like any war-documentary type of movie. I mean the problem I had with the second half of the movie is that it kind of loses the powerful writing, characters and story that it had on the first half of the movie. I mean for the rest of the platoons you just don't care for, you only are for the three characters that I mentioned. I know something was missing in the second half of the movie. \r\nThe film was directed by the infamous Stanley Kubrick. It is an adaptation of the 1979 novel The Short-Timers by Gustav Hasford. Full Metal Jacket was nominated for eleven awards worldwide between 1987 and 1989 including an  Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, two BAFTA Awards for Best Sound and Best Special Effects, and a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor for Ermey. This was Kubrick's last war film and penultimate movie that he directed. \r\nYou are a person whom enjoys slow war movies then this is the movie for you. If you love drama/war movies that have two plots at the same time and don't care about the pacing then go and watch this movie. This is a must-see movie to all Stanley Kubrick fans. The film is not for kids for drugs, adult topic, and graphic war violence.",

            "content": "Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket is one of the greatest and most honest films about war ever made. Descending neither to the level of gung-ho shoot-'em-up or self righteous anti-war screed, it instead earnestly tells the unflinching truth about the hell that is war, and how men deal with it. In following one James T. \"Joker\" Davis (Matthew Modine) on his journey from wide-eyed recruit on Parris Island to battle hardened veteran in the battlefields of Vietnam, it shows us what it means to be an American soldier in wartime.\r\n\tThe first thing you should understand about this movie is that Kubrick does nothing halfway. Instead of a half-baked montage of training scenes as music blares, we spend nearly half the movie on watching the characters go through the Corps' basic training beginning to end. The drill sergeant (real life Marine Corps drill instructor R. Lee Emery) uses language that will make polite company spontaneously burst into flames. When a man is hit by bullets, red sprays in every direction. And when someone takes a life for the first time, you will see their face harden as a part of them changes forever.\r\nThe second thing to understand is that Kubrick is not interested in protesting our involvement in Vietnam, demonizing our leaders a la Oliver Stone, or making our soldiers into traumatized, debauched frat-boys a la Jarhead, but neither does he have any intention of shying away from hard truths. Full Metal Jacket is completely open about the fact that a large part of military training is taking away any qualms you have about killing, including making you see the enemy as less than human. It frankly acknowledges that when one of our boys got a come-on from a whore, his first response was most likely \"How much?\" And it does not try to make combat look glorious, heroic, or anything else but terrifying and bloody.\r\nThirdly, this movie wants you to understand that despite the dehumanizing effects of what they go through, our troops are still thinking, feeling human beings. They understand that they are in hell, and that every day could be their last. They turn to humor, nihilism, false bravado, or their fellow soldiers. Some men find ways to distance themselves from the insanity of their situations. Others, like Joker, embrace the contradictions of their existence. And at the end of the day, each man is just glad to be alive.\r\nSome have complained that the second half of the film is shapeless, and lacks an overarching narrative.  And they're right. Except for the presence of Joker, and the setting in Vietnam, there is no common thread holding these scenes together. But that's the point. The second half isn't about a battle, or how America lost the war. It is simply a record of one man's experiences in Vietnam.  Real life doesn't follow a set plotline, with rising action, false crisis, false dawn, real crisis, resolution, and maybe a twist or two that no-one saw coming. A combat tour is not always a journey of personal development and self discovery, and it is rarely a series of ever more dangerous missions culminating in an explosive climax. \r\nThere have also been complaints that the film's message was 'muddled' or that its message was too little too late.  Some of this criticism comes from critics I greatly respect. But once again, they are missing the point. Full Metal Jacket is not an 'issue' movie, or a 'message' movie. It is not for or against the Vietnam War. It seeks neither to glorify war and justify our actions in Vietnam, or to preach about the evils of war and why it must be avoided at all costs. It only seeks to show the reality of combat.\r\n And I suspect that for some critics, this is the sticking point. They want a clear stand on the morality of the war, preferably against it. I can understand this. Many of them were proud participants in the anti-war movement. They want to hear Kubrick, who for many of them is practically an idol, agree with their views. Or like a college professor grading a student's essay, they want to know \"Just what is your position on the subject?\" But part of the beauty of Full Metal Jacket is that it doesn't take a side or tell us what to think. It doesn't want to advocate a position or alter our opinion on the war. It only wants to show us the reality of it.\r\nSo if you watch this movie, do not expect nonstop action and heroics, discussions about the wisdom of American foreign policy in Southeast Asia, or even a unifying plotline for much of the film. But expect to gain a greater appreciation for those who have been through the hell that is war. And expect to be impressed.",

            "content": "Full Metal Jacket is one of the greatest war epics ever and its a mind boggling movie by Stanley Kubrick and is one of the few incredible films that defined him as possibly the greatest directors in history.  The story is not just another war film, its a film that shows you the true horrors of war and how it changes a man, how it can drive a man insane, and how they deal with the pains and horrors of war, and Stanley Kubrick captures one of the best visions of war I have ever seen, and it truly shows the viewer the risks they take if they ever consider going to war.  The cast is genius and great, Mathew Modine is good but I think the real genius comes from R. Lee Ermy and Vincent D'Onofrio are the real genius and are the real performances I will remember when I remember this film.  The war scenes are incredible, and what makes them even better is they do not use all these special effect to create a great war film, they just use the tools and knowledge that make it realistic and great.  many people claim that the first half of the film is great and the second half stinks, but I disagree, while I found the first half at the boot camp to be much better, the second half shows the real horrors of combat and is  true genius, but I just found that other than the film Jarhead not many war films show this great of scenes that also show the pain of training for war.  My favorite Kubrick film is A Clockwork Orange, but that is not to say this was not one of his best, and this film is honestly one of the war films that will be remembered until the end of time, and I really think every person who has ever experienced war will find this film even more emotional and great than I did.",

The transformation from civilian to disciplined killer during the Vietnam era is scary in its accuracy.  There are so many brilliant notable performances throughout with two I'll mention.  R Lee Ermey as Senior Drill Instructor Gunnery Sergeant Hartman is amazing and very real and this is due in large part because he is a Marine and was a Drill Instructor in the Corps.  Fat body Private Leonard (Golmar Pyle) played by Vincent Da'Onofrio is nothing short of brilliant.\nThe second part of this film is in the Vietnam, in the shit, in the field, in combat.  We follow joker as a journalist following a grunt platoon.  What follows is jaw dropping with the cinematography, musically with the score and songs, and the dialogue.  This is one of my favorite films of all time and not just because I'm a Marine.  A masterpiece amongst masterpieces from Stanley Kubrick.  10/10 from me.\n\n\"Graduation is only a few days away, and the recruits of Platoon 3092 are salty.

Full Metal Jacket follows a platoon of US marines through the dehumanising and brainwashing effects of boot camp to the traumatic effects of the Vietnam War. Similarly too many other works of Kubrick, Full Metal Jacket is a dark satire but this time on war. The opening act at boot camp is darkly brutal but at the exact same time darkly funny. R. Lee Ermey (who plays Gunnery Sergeant Hartman) in his mostly improvised role, is fantastic delivering an endless array of quotable lines. The dehumanising effects and brainwashing that are clearly evident is disturbing and shocking as the marines are insulted and made to feel worthless. Much has been said that the first half is by far superior to the second half but this does not turn out to be entirely true.  The second half is full of tension (the sniper sequence is excellent), expertly staged war sequences (the urban warfare sequences are intense) and some marvellous cinematography (which was actually shot in England). The performances are sensational, particularly from Vincent D'Onofrio and Matthew Modine, the soundtrack is awesome (featuring Nancy Sinatra and the Rolling Stones) and Kubrick's anti war film leaves you with one major message-War is hell.\r\n\r\n4.5/5.",

The critics loved it, but they also loved Full Metal Jacket, as do I. It is my second favorite Vietnam War piece next to the immortal \"Apocalypse Now.\" Full Metal Jacket is not only a Vietnam movie, it is essentially TWO separate movies in one. Which makes it quite original and intriguing.\n\nThe first half is the training of a group of Marines under a drill sergeant played by R. Lee Emery. True or not, I don't know, but in this training the Marine's humanity is forcefully stripped in order to turn them into killing machines, thirsting for violence. I don't want to spoil anything, but geez, Watch Vincent D'Onofrio's character at the end of this segment. Probably the creepiest part of a war movie I've ever seen.\n\nThe second half is the Vietnam War. Where the main connecting character, Private Joker, is now an army-employed journalist. This segment starts slow, and is a letdown after the de facto climax of the previous segment. The sole reason I'm rating this only 4/5 stars (I only review movies I LOVE). \n\nIn this segment the star is by far a buff and blood-lusting \"Animal Mother\" (Adam Baldwin's iconic role, unless you're a geek like me and watched Serenity). I gotta admit. I have a sac, I have testosterone, and watching Animal Mother fire an M-80 machine gun practically disintegrating buildings, made me feel pumped. Of course, then there is the final horrific segment where the platoon Joker is with wounds a young Viet-Cong female sniper. Again, I don't want to spoil what is a fantastic ending.\n\nThis movie is a must-see for any 1.) Vietnam war-movie buff 2.) Lover of good movies. Oh it's hardcore even as war movies go, but it's GOOD hardcore and one of the treasures on top of the pile of my movie collection.\n\nMatt",

            "content": "\"Me so horny. Me love you long time!\"\nKubrick's film is both brutal and thought provoking but still not his best in my opinion. \nPlot: Set during the Tet Offensive, the first half takes place on Parris Island, South Carolina, one of the most brutal boot camps in the country. The story follows a group of recruits that are subjected to humiliation and grueling exercises. One of the recruits, nicknamed Pyle because of he is naive and dim witted, is repeatedly taunted by the drill sergeant. Unknown to the sergeant, Pyle is actually mentally unstable. Pyle is helped by a recruit nicknamed \"Joker\", but even his helping won't stop the terrible event that unfolds. The second half takes place in Vietnam where Joker, now a Marine Combat Correspondent, sees the horrors of war that will forever change the way he thinks.\nDirected by Stanley Kubrick(2001: A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange, Spartacus, The Shining), Full Metal Jacket is a fantastic Vietnam war movie, but not the best in my opinion. Platoon and Apocalypse Now take that spot. The best performance by far is R. Lee Ermey who is hilarious yet brutal as the drill sergeant. The cinematography is absolutely fantastic and the action scenes are very well done and extremely realistic,but I really wasn't that impressed with the script for some reason. I just didn't really care about any of the characters. I really liked the first half of the film,but second part just sort of dragged on until the end which is very thought provoking sad and saying what it is would ruin the whole movie. But despite some parts I didn't really find interesting, this should still be regarded as a classic. Total Score: 8.0/10",

Nascido para Matar é obviamente dividido em dois atos - o primeiro, superior, mostra um grupo de recrutas da marinha sob o rigoroso treinamento fascista do Sgt. Hartman (em fantástica interpretação de R. Lee Ermey). Algo incomum em sua obra, Kubrick cria um personagem que estabelece uma relação direta com o espectador através do malfadado soldado Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio). Seu sofrimento e sentimento de exclusão preparam o terreno para a segunda parte da narrativa, na qual vemos as máquinas de matar na qual os recrutas foram transformados.\n\nEnquanto a segunda metade da película acabe muitas vezes caindo no lugar comum de tantos outros filmes de guerra (propulsionado também pela falta de um protagonista marcante), o desenrolar dos momentos finais é especialmente impactante. A vertente de Kubrick ainda se mostra neutra, mostrando os efeitos devastadores do conflito (mais em termos psicológicos do que físicos), mas evitando criar uma obra condescendente ou moralista.",

All this mainly thanks to R. Lee Ermey's and Vincent D'Onofrio's performance. The film is far less interesting after they leave.\nThe second half isn't as bad as most people say, and it does fit with the first half to an extent. It's simply the fact that the second part is completely outshined by the first, and we're left with a sense of awkward bemusement as we watch what turns out to be a good film after being promised a great one by the boot camp section.\nOverall I'd say it's one of Kubrick's lesser works, but it's still good stuff and it has some of the most intriguing and memorable dialogue in film history.",

Much more depressing and sadistic, and it figures that I'd like it more haha. Very heartfelt performances, great music from the period, and even the battles are different, since most take place in cities and not in the jungles. Dunno if I like this better than Apocalypse Now, but then again, can we really consider that to be a \"Vietnam movie\"? Its setting is during the war, but does not really portray it. This one unflinchingly does. Kubrick is perfect, as always. This was only nominated for adapted screenplay...*sigh* Kinda thought R. Lee Ermey shoulda won an oscar for this, and Kubrick, but hey, what do I know? I'm not in the Academy, nor do I ever want to be. Sorry, don't mean to rant. Great, great film!",

This film could have cut a few scenes off to lower the run time because towards the second half of the movie came to a bit of a stand still. There is an obvious change in pace and acting between boot camp/HQ and the battle zone so there is no corny or cheesy acting/ plot changes going on. Story is simple, but its the character connection that moves this along. The beginning gives a background to how our main marines started out. There is some pretty obvious parts but it didn't bother me that much. Its not all out shoot everyone because its cool, its all revenge/payback with true meaning. Dialogue was a great balance between humor and drama especially for a war based film. 4.5/5",
