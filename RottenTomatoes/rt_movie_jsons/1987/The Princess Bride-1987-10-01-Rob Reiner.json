The producers and actors are able to twist a \"damsel in distress\" film and make it into something extraordinary that never fails to keep viewers on the edge of their seats. Cary Elwes and Robin Wright envelop every part of their characters gracefully and indulge the audience in sweet romance. While Mandy Patinkin plays Inigo swiftly and effortlessly and Wallace Shawn portrays Vizzini who gives the film an idiotic yet comedic environment. Unknowingly becoming an outstanding movie of its time The Princess Bride continues to captivate younger viewers even today.",

Filled with drama, suspense, comedy, action and, of course, romance, it is packed with wonderful characters, iconic dialogue, solid performances from top to bottom from a fantastic cast, an effective score from Dire Straits front man Mark Knopfler, and enough nods to the swashbuckling films from decades earlier to keep audiences entranced from start to finish.

The production design is pretty cheap, the cinematography is fine at best and pretty uninspired at worst, and the score is pretty cheesy all the way around. That being said, though, the tone is what makes Princess Bride works-at no point does this movie want you to take it seriously and that's why it has endured so well.\n\nThe screenplay and comedic performances are where Princess Bride really shines. There are so many iconic lines and bits in the film, it would be futile to try to compile the list here of times I smiled or laughed. The ensemble cast was full of lovable characters spouting iconic lines of dialogue, definitely worth revisiting again and again. I have to point out the child acting performance of the boy who played the boy being read the story. His line delivery was pitch-perfect, and I laughed out loud more than a few times at his running commentary on the story.\n\nThis movie is so fun and I adore it, but as a finished product of cinema, I've definitely seen better. But that definitely doesn't mean I don't love it.",

Of course, Reiner deserves only half the credit, because his film brings to life this unusual, inventive story and screenplay by William Goldman.  Cary Elwes and Robin Wright are perfectly cast, and Many Patinkin deserves special kudos for his outstanding performance.",

            "content": "Another quarantine film appreciation class with my kids was a hit (\"Labyrinth\" also got a thumbs-up. \"E.T.\" got a Meh). From writer William Goldman (\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" \"All the Presidents Men\" \"Misery\") and director Rob Reiner (\"This is Spinal Tap\" \"Stand by Me\" \"When Harry Met Sally\" and also \"Misery\") comes a very subversive fairy tale send-up. It's charming and wimiscal enough that the kids will love it and it's witty and subversive that adults will love it even more so. What makes this parody film unique is that while Goldman and Reiner are certainly poking fun at fairy tale tropes, they also tell a fairy tale with genuine charm and sweetness. Compared to other parody films like \"Blazing Saddles\" or \"Airplane\" which are entirely mocking and ridicule, \"The Princess Bride\" is at its heart is still a fairy tale love story. I won't bother summarizing the story, since I'm assuming everyone has already watched this film, but \"The Princess Bride\" boasts a stellar cast, led by then unknown Cary Elwes (\"Robin Hood: Men in Tights\" \"Glory\" \"Days of Thunder\" \"Stranger Things\") and Robin Wright (\"Forrest Gump\" \"Moneyball\" \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" \"House of Cards\"). The scene stealing supporting cast has SO many iconic moments! Wallace Shawn shouting \"Inconceivable!\" and the battle of wits face-off. Peter Cook's speech impaired clergyman. Mel Smith's throat clogged Albino. Carol Kane and Billy Crystal as the bickering Valerie and Miracle Max. Mandy Patinkin's Inigo Montoya is the main standout in the cast, who's performance still gave me chills when he has his final confrontation with Christopher Guest's six-fingered Count Rugen. Patinkin brings a level of emotion to the film that brings unexpected depth and heart. Then there's the enormous Andr\u00e9 the Giant, who pretty much steals every scene he's in. I also usually dislike wraparound  or story bookends, but Fred Savage and  Peter Falk are wonderful as a grandfather and grandson reading the story together, which affords lots of opportunities for commentary on the story and to even skip over the boring parts. The film's Once-Upon-A-Time feel is greatly aided is a lush score by Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits and beautiful  photography by Adrian Biddle (\"Aliens\" \"Thelma & Louise\" \"V for Vendetta\") that gives the film a timeless feel. On the downside, the film's villains seem underdeveloped and not all that interesting. Also, the film does have some pacing issues where the story drags a bit at times. Still, those are minor quibbles for a film that really does deserve its status as a classic film that both kids and adults (for different reasons) will enjoy. FUN FACT: Andr\u00e9 the Giant called almost everybody on set (be they director, producers, co-stars or crew) \"boss\", a technique he employed to defer to people he liked and go some way towards counteracting the way he would tower over them.",

This film is an absolute embarrassment and I cannot recommend it  to anyone of any age. \n\nUsually I am in agreement with Rotten Tomatoes and their opinions about movies. But when they score The princess bride a 97% and give it a \"certified fresh\" sticker, It calls into question their entire website and career choice. This film has it all. Poor acting, embarrassing set design, cringe worthy characters, tinny music and a terribly written storyline. Let's first start with the acting. Im imagining the casting session where all the candidates showed up and auditioned and they just picked the worst ones. They acting was nothing like i'd ever seen before. The lines were delivered with less than no emotion. The facial expressions resembled pieces of sour tart fruit. The body language was flaccid and unconvincing. The way the actual movie was portrayed was a disgust to the entire motion picture art. It is a mortification that this movie stands by others. \n\nLet's now divulge into the actual storyline. The Princess Bride is about a forbidden love story between a princess and a farm boy. Shocking and predictable. I can appreciate where the story was trying to go, poor farm boy going through extreme lengths to get the desirable girl of his dreams. But the cheesy and mediocre rendering of this is why the movie is so bad. The trenching through the forest, the wine test and sword fights. If I ever have to hear the word \"inconceivable\" said so many times in a row by a fat wrinkled man again I will slam my tongue in a car door. This was an annoying film, which, when studied for an English assignment and made to watch over and over again, became torturous and agitating. I cannot express how notoriously bad this film was. It was very cliche. The poor, up for debate handsome, farm boy charms the princess into being with himself instead of the intended prince bachelor. I think someone dies, though I can't really remember, I don't want to remember.",

            "content": "More than 30 years ago, audiences were introduced to a movie that has become one of the greatest and most beloved romantic comedies of all time in The Princess Bride.  This cinema classic has stood the test of time.  It's still just as enjoyable today as it was when it originally debuted in theaters in 1987.  Whether one is a fan of the comedy drama or fantasy and romance, The Princess Bride is able to appease audiences of all three genres.  So what is it that makes it such a timeless work?  It all starts with the writing.  It's a simple love story with more than enough romance, sword fighting, and satire to appease both male and female audiences.  Along with the writing, the acting of Cary Elwes and Robin Wright (and their supporting cast) and the directing of Hollywood legend Rob Reiner play their own role in the movie's success.  And now in its 31st year as one of the movie industry's greatest movies, the bonus features included in the latest re-issue make it that much better.  The writing behind The Princess Bride is one of the biggest factors in the success of the movie.  This movie isn't the first time that a movie has ever been adapted from a book.  That the story would actually be told from the book in the movie itself is in itself a funny joke.  [Rob] Reiner doesn't mention anything about this in the additional commentary, but one can't help but laugh at the thought that here is a story being told on screen within the context of a movie that has been adapted from the same book being read to the then very young Fred Savage.  Staying in that same vein, the movie does change a few things here and there.  But for the most part, it makes a valiant effort to stay true to author William Golding's book by the same name.  Knowing this serves to make the movie that much more enjoyable.\n\nThe writing behind The Princess Bride is enjoyable as it tries to stay so close to the original book by William Golding.  Add in the acting of an all-star cast and the movie becomes even more enjoyable.  The chemistry and comedic timing of Cary Elwes and his castmates makes for so much laughter throughout the course of the movie's near two hour run time.  Those laughs brought on by the cast's acting are clean laughs.  As Reiner notes in the commentary, it's clean enough for audiences of all ages to enjoy, which is part of the reason for the story's longevity.  Audiences will also thrill at Rob Reiner's comment in the bonus feature, \"True Love: The Princess Bride Phenomenon\" that no one but Cary Elwes and Robin Wright could play the roles of Wesley and Princess Buttercup.  And audiences will agree with that sentiment, too in watching the new interview included in this new edition.\n\nReiner's commentary and his sit down with Elwes and Wright add so much more context to the acting and the writing that makes The Princess Bride such a wonderful adaptation.  His sit down with Elwes and Wright are new additions to this newest edition of the classic flick.  Along with it, this edition also culls the special features from the movie's previous DVD releases for the first time.  There's also a new feature title, \"Love is Like a Storybook.\"  It offers a more in depth look at specific elements of the story, making for that much more appreciation for the whole thing.  All combined, the bonus features and the commentary make this classic story that much better.  Add in great acting and equally impressive writing, and it goes without saying that The Princess Bride will continue to be a fan and family favorite for another quarter of a century.",

The type of humor that this movie uses is a sarcastic, witty humor with simple lines. \n\nDon't leave this review believing that this is a bad movie, I am simply explaining its simplicity. The movie starts with a farm boy and a girl falling in love and the farm boy having to leave to make money. The woman is left to believe that her farm boy was killed by the evil pirate. She is forced to move on and marry another man. Before the wedding, she is kidnapped by three men. Her farm boy comes for her rescue in a disguise and takes down the men, one by one. He reveals himself to her and they are finally brought together again. They are trying to escape from the King's men who are trying to find the Princess. They are caught and Wesley is held in a torture chamber. The two men from the beginning of the movie come to help Wesley escape and get the princess back before she marries the King. At the end, Wesley and the Princess are happy together forever. \n\nI recommend this movie to you if you enjoy a good romantic comedy. Don't watch this movie if you are looking for a crazy, King story. ",

One of the was a swordsman who has a cocky nature and finds himself losing to the protagonist later into the movie. The \"leader\" is an intellectual that also has a cocky feeling to him, who actually dies due to his intelligence taking over his choices. The last of the three is a giant who is not cocky like the others, but he is not the smartest out of them. He is a great character to add although he might not be the best developed, he does bring light to the other characters. The giant is 100% viable due to his size it wouldn't be surprising in real life. The story started with a farmer boy who later develops to a protagonist for a princess. The protagonist doesn't necessarily have a cocky personality, but he does have a really humble heart, and he does find peace within the rest of the story. The whole story basically revolves around a princess and a lover storyline. That doesn't have a lot of holes, and is very enjoyable. This movie is old but it still satisfies my movie tastes. Overall The Princess Bride is a well developed movie with a great character development that will prove to be one of the best literary adaptations in my books.",

The Princess Bride is a predictable yet enjoyable movie, and although almost every twist and turn was seen by the minds predictions they chose the still entertaining ones. If you are expecting a grand epitome of ideas then this movie is simply not for you, but if you simply want to watch a movie for fun this no look further. The plot follows a basic premise a love story torn apart and brought back together by fate and will. A man who lost his bride, who also happened to be a princes, must  overcome three men. When he does so he finds his love but waits to reveal his identity to her. When he does so they venture off on a sort of reunion trip. The prince whom the princess was supposed to marry finds then and takes the princess away. Seeing the other man as a rival he lies to the princess and takes the man away to a torture dungeon under the castle. The man almost dies but is saved by two of the men from earlier. Together the three storm the castle, defeat the prince, and reunite the princess and her love. The story it's time when it needs to and has many enjoyable confrontations between the characters. The characters you want to die die, and the characters you don't want to don't. My only strife with this film is the weird and unnecessary subplot that takes place in the background between a grandson and his grandfather. The story will pause for a few minutes to show annoying and unwanted banter between the two to display that the whole story is actually just a tale. Overall, if you can take away from it's biggest weakness you can find a good watch. I would recommend this film to anyone with spare time.",

It's the classic tale of a man saving his woman through many obstacles and challenges. The movie starts with a boy who is playing video games in his bed. His grandfather then comes in and decides to read him a bedtime story. It starts with Wesley having to travel across the sea and the story takes place later with three men kidnapped Buttercup to start a war. As the three men travel with Buttercup Wesley is after them and defeats each man one by one. The story continues as Wesly and Buttercup go through a few obstacles themselves like quicksand and huge, aggressive, possums. They then run into the King and Wesley gets knocked out and placed in a torture basement. Andre the Giant and Inigo take Wesley out of the basement and plan on taking Buttercup back from the King. They do so by causing fear in the first line of defense through Fizzik in a costume on fire. Wesley gets Buttercup back from the king and Inigo gets his revenge on the six fingered man for killing his father. All while taking a throwing knife in the gut. It ends with everyone running off in white horses and everyone lives happily ever after. As the Grandfather finishes the book and leaves the room, the boy asks if he can come back tomorrow to read the book again. \n\nThis adventure filled comedy is a classic to many people including myself. I think the choice of actors is great especially with Andre The Giant portraying a giant with a sensitive side to himself. This movie is filled with comedy scenes, especially when Wesleye outsmarts Vizzini which he then proceeds to knocking out and dying from his cockiness. For most of the movie you do forget that the Grandfather is reading this story to his grandson. This movie is a perfect 5/5 stars, and is very deserving of this rating through the acting and storytelling. \n",

This movie was Ok but it was amazing, why was that amazing? Well I'll show you everything why. A kid plays the NES and then his grandfather comes in and gave him a present that was a book and he starts to read the book and the kid seems to enjoy it. The humphrey and Buttercup fell in love but then left each other, then the king wants to marry the lady but he feels like something could happen, But Buttercup doesn't like the king. The king or humphrey want to date Buttercup but then things get frisky. She got kidnapped by a guy, a giant, and a man. She had to escape but he mentioned that there are shrieking eels but they caught her and then they sailed for the canyon. They climb up a mountain and find a new place before the prince can find her. Someone had to distract the prince. They both talk for a bit. And they start to duel and the spanish prince won. The guy starts to get mad and tells the giant to hit him with the rock but failed. And they start to wrestle. He finished the giant and the swordsman and he runs to the kidnapper meanwhile the other knights chase after him and track him down and they meet and they talk it out the hard way. They do a wine roulette and the spanish prince won. Meanwhile the knights try to find the princess.The Spanish prince was actually a thief and he kidnapped the princess. She pushed him and she falls too but they survive and they fall in love. The knights are still on the search for the princess. While the thief and the princess kissed. And the kid wants to skip it. The thief and the princess saw the knights coming for her, and they went to an evil forest and stayed safe for the time being. They drowned in quicksand but made it out alive. They got attacked by a rat and she manages to do something and they kill the rat. And then they got caught by the knights and they start to get separated. The thief was silenced and he was then taken to the place of despair. The princess is now in the castle and now trying to be queen but then a lady confronted her but it was a nightmare and runs to the king and says that she loves Westly but the king thinks she shouldn't love him. The king then starts to think that she would have to let go of Westly and then leave the princess to herself. The kingdom starts to get rid of the Thief forest but the Guy and the Giant survive out of the Kings demands of rebuilding a new kingdom and come up with a plan. The king gets mad and sends the princess to get westly and sent her to her dungeon and trying to torture Westly. So the man and the giant are on a mission. And then the kid interrupted and Westly died and things got bad. The 2 got him and took him to a nearby old wizard to heal him. Westly lives and they help him. The bride then prepares and things start to turn. The Wedding starts and then the battle begins and the giant scares them with a fire trick. They went in the castle and the spanish guy fights some guy who looks like Napoleon III. The spanish guy almost got defeated by Napoleon III and keeps fighting him until Napoleon died. Westly and Buttercup fell in love and kissed, the villain and Westly start fighting. Westly roasted the villain. The villain has surrendered and Westly won the fight. and then the whole kingdom is saved. Westly and Buttercup reunited and they both fell in love and became king and queen and they fell in love. And they all lived happily never after. The Grandpa left and the kid told him he loved the book. The story for this is alright but it did have some funny parts in it. The characters are mostly known from other films but the characters fit good for the film even the villain didn't die this time. This movie completely struck as the best movie of the century, I'm sure no one can deny it too. I can say this movie is amazing no matter what. 9/10",

With another story going on in the book grandpa was reading. The storyline of the book is filled with love and princesses and pirates and kidnapping. The sick boy is accompanied by his grandfather who decided to come over and watch him, whilst reading one of his favorite books \"The Princess Bride\". At first the boy is uninterested and doesn't really want to read the book with his grandfather until his grandfather began reading and the boy got more and more interested as the story escalated. Within that story they were reading, it spoke upon this young couple who was in love and very much head over heels about one another. Until one day, the young man leaves and never returns, leaving the young woman heartbroken and sad. The journey of this double storyline film is engaging, interesting, and very humorous. \n\nIn my opinion, there should've been more scenes of the boy and the grandfather reacting to the scenes of the storyline. Aside from that, the soundtrack and dialogue was well followed through and executed well. Although the effects of the fighting/acting scenes weren't THAT believable, it still entertained me, the audience. \n\nSo to recommend this film? Yes, it is worthy to watch. This film has a family feel to it, meaning it can be watched with children, adults, elders and etc. The storyline within the storyline is eye catching, and the details are specific with a reasonable length of the movie.\n\nThe Princess Bride, approved by me. A fun, thrilling, love story film with good dialogue, humor, and a not too slow storyline. The perfect move for just about anybody. Although it is an older film, it still has an engaging feel to it. \n",

I am not a huge fan of fantasy movies which I guess would maybe make me a bit biased for reviewing this but I think I just had very high expectations because of things I had heard about it. I would have to say though that I did like how they made this whole world into a story that is being read by a grandpa to his grandson I thought that was sweet. It was cute to see the transition of the little boy listening to the story going from ew a love story to asking his grandfather if he could come the next day to read it to him again. Some things though that I did not quite love about the movie were the kind of cheesy humor I just was not really amused by and the name of Buttercup being given the princess bride I would have to say kind of threw me off because when her name was first said I thought it was for her horse. I think there were probably a lot better options for the name of a beautiful princess bride than Buttercup. It was a really corny title and I just couldn\u00b4t take the scene seriously when they were addressing her with that name. Furthermore, the movie was not bad and I would be willing to give it another shot sometime if a person was a fan of fantasy I think you would most likely enjoy this film a little more than I did.",

The film stars Cary Elwes as Westley, Robin Wright as Buttercup, Mandy Patinkin\nInigo Montoya, and Andr\u00e9 the Giant as Fezzik.\n\nThe story was creative and enjoyable, especially from how it was told, but if I had one problem it would be that I wish they focussed on the adventure aspect a little more then they did.\n\nThe acting was strong and even at times whimsical, especially Mandy Patinkin's great portrayal of the character Inigo Montoya.\n\nThe characters were fun and portrayed well, from Wallace Shawn's extremely entertaining character Vizzini to the persevering character of Inigo Montoya. The only two characters who I found to be a little annoying at times were Buttercup and the grandson, but luckily they didn't distract me from the film that much.\n\nThe sets and costumes were very strong and detailed, especially with the look and design of the castle.\n\nThe music was steady and filled its purpose, but I do wish that they focused on it a little more instead of just pushing it to the side.\n\nThe comedy in my opinion was hands down the strongest aspect of the film, especially the scenes involving the main characters talking to the side characters.\n\nThe film I also found to be really entertaining, and I hope to watch it again soon.\n\nOver all I give it a\n8/10\n\n\"My name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die\"",

            "content": "A delightful romance fantasy tale!\n\nDirector Rob Reiner's fantasy romance comedy The Princess Bride (1987) is a sweet product of its time. It takes Mark Knopfler's very 1980's style music and a quaint framing device of a grandfather reading a bedtime story to his sick grandson. William Goldman's story is a fun romance drama about true love with a ridiculous comedy style where nonsense happens because it's fun. Reiner's direction is fanciful and fun at all times. The cuts to Peter Falk's narration are neat as is the epic journey within The Princess Bride's brief 98 minute run-time.\n\nPeter Falk is awesome as the kindly grandfather reading to his bratty, yet eager grandson. Fred Savage plays the grandson with a willful ignorance many young boys have that slowly reveals him to be a thoughtful young man that yearns to be more emotionally open. His grandfather teaches a valuable lesson about love, appreciation, and adventure! Falk is one of The Princess Bride's greatest attributes as his portrayal is so gentle, witty, and adoring towards Savage that he endears himself to you immediately. I love Peter Falk as Grandpa in The Princess Bride.\n\nCary Elwes is wonderful as the heroic Westley. His charm and charisma are dauntless as he effortlessly delivers hilarious dialogue and quirky insults. Robin Wright is lovely and loyal as Princess Buttercup. Her devotion to and chemistry with Elwes is excellent. They play well together.\n\nMandy Patinkin is riveting as the sword master Inigo Montoya on the hunt for revenge after his father's murder. His fencing duel with Cary Elwes is one of the best in cinema history as is his climactic moment with his foil Christopher Guest's cruel Count Rugen. Their duel is fierce and directed beautifully by Rob Reiner in a serious dramatic way. Montoya is my favorite character in The Princess Bride as you are endeared by his quest and entertained by his compelling performance.\n\nI have to mention Montoya's criminal travelling companions. The lovable Andre the Giant is so quaint as the simple-minded and good-hearted Fezzik. It's cool watching The Princess Bride and seeing this hulking gentle giant have fun with his friends. Wallace Shawn is gut busting as the abusive and arrogant Vizzini. His challenge of the minds with Cary Elwes is perhaps the best writing in the film.\n\nI do not like Chris Sarandon as Prince Humperdinck. He's kind of generic and has less charisma and presence than the other brilliantly cast actors. At least Mel Smith gets a funny cameo as the sadistic Albino. On the other hand of Sarandon is the comedy Billy Crystal as Miracle Max. He gets such a memorable and ridiculous cameo that you cannot forget Crystal as the potion swindling Miracle Max in The Princess Bride. Overall, the cast of the film elevates the comedic to genuine dramatic moments like Montoya's redemption or Elwes' romance with Wright. At the same time, the comedic moments will keep you laughing even though there could be more jokes.\n\nIn all, The Princess Bride isn't Rob Reiner's best direction, that would be Stand by Me, nor his best comedy, that would be This Is Spinal Tap; however, The Princess Bride is always a pleasure to watch. It continues to be a dreamy experience of enjoyable fantasy adventure, silly comedy situations, and sweet romantic encounters.",

The Princess Bride is a film which tries to do a lot of things and succeeds at all of them. The romance between Buttercup and Wheatley is genuinely effective - I wanted the two characters to end up together, unlike many movie romances where I don't care. The comedy is also effective, in large part thanks to the snappy dialogue - I don't amuse easily, and the scene where Vizzini is trying to guess which glass is poisoned legitimately made me laugh. As an adventure film, The Princess Bride is one of the best I've seen recently, with a fast pace and the occasional well-choreographed action scene such as the duel between Inigo Montoya and the Man in Black. The heroes are even more memorable than the action, with the snarky Wheatley, the honorable, revenge-obsessed swordsman Inigo Montoya, and the bumbling but well-meaning giant Fezzik. My only real criticism of the film is that Buttercup is bland compared to some of the other characters. On a final note, given that many adaptations are criticized for unfaithfulness, this film is as close as possible to the author's vision for an adaptation - William Goldman pushed for a film adaptation of his novel and wrote the film's screenplay himself.",
