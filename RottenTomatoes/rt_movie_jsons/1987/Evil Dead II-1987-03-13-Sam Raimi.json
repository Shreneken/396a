It's the ultimate horror comedy that has it all: humor, gore, and unforgettable characters. Bruce Campbell's portrayal of Ash Williams is a standout performance that truly brings the character to life in a better way than the original. His acting skills are top-notch and make the film a lot better. This movie is a wild ride from start to finish, offering pure ridiculous fun that is sure to leave you highly entertained. The amount of gore featured in the film is staggering, making it one of the bloodiest horror films ever made. It's not for the faint of heart, but for fans of the genre, it's an absolute must-see. Evil Dead 2 is one of the best horror films ever made, and it's easy to see why. It's a horror comedy that stands out from the rest, with its unique blend of humor and terror. If you haven't experienced this cult classic yet, you're missing out on one of the greatest horror films of all time.",

Which doesn't mean he can't be serious.\nYou can laugh at his grandiose funny moments, but you can also take him seriously.\nIt's very rare for a character in a horror movie to go through such character development.\nOne of the few horror movies where I can believe that the character is as strong as his opponents.\n\nThis film is incredibly creative and the practical effects are still worth seeing today.\nIn the fights between Ash and Henrietta and Ash and rotten apple head you can see what you can do with the right budget.\nThe secondary characters also worked well in the film and I love how Army of Darkness is built on.\nThe plot isn't the focus, but Ash's development into a unique character that has gone down in pop culture history.\n\nThis film has endless iconic scenes.\nE.g. the scene where Ash saws off his hand, the dance scene of Linda, the head scene of Linda, the fight against Henrietta and rotten apple head, the scene where Ash replaces his hand with a chainsaw, the scenes with Ash's possessed hand, the surprising one end, etc. But what was funny about the film? The plot isn't funny, and the characters don't make many jokes. Most of the scary scenes are also the funny scenes.\nIt's the implementation.\n\nEven the exposition scene is visually beautifully implemented.\nEven the demons still look impressive today.\nThe practical effects never disappoint in an evil dead film anyway.",

This is the pinnacle of the series, it takes everything that was setup in the first film and builds upon it. The third film has a more action orientated and the \u2018remake' more of a horror leaning, the series is probably the most similar of the following franchise entries. This is not a remake of the first but the first 6 minutes is a recap. The rest is a rollercoaster of horrific images and stunning effects considering the budget with insanely over-the-top acting and enough dark humour to keep anyone happy. Thoroughly excellent film, memorable and entertaining.",

I'm sure you could talk about the brilliant defiance of convention as Sam Raimi and co-writer Scott Spiegel played off not only their contemporaries, but the film's direct predecessor. But I don't want to talk about any of that, I want to talk about how this is the best horror-comedy of all time without needing any in-depth analysis or criticism. \n\nIt's got gruesome gore without ever sacrificing an explicitly fun tone. There are stopmotion effects that rival anything that Harryhausen put out. It's got a guy pinning his severed hand down to the floor with a copy of Farewell to Arms. The cinematography is creative and plays directly into the demonic presence with a Looney Tunes flair. And most importantly, it's helmed by Bruce Campbell, who gives a marvelously entertaining performance as Ash, with the physical control to sell a B-movie homage with action trimmings, and facial expressions that would make Jim Carrey envious. \n\nWhere the budget was limited, the production team used what they had to craft a film that presented itself as not only tongue-in-cheek but reverential of the classic horrors that came before. It's a film that's never not fun, even when it's soaked in blood. In fact, particularly when it's soaked in blood. (4.5/5)",

            "content": "Absurd camp horror of the highest order!\n\nDirector Sam Raimi's horror comedy Evil Dead 2 (1987) is a hilarious spoof and sequel to The Evil Dead. It's very much like Raimi parodying himself with heightened shots where the direction is constantly chaotic and ever changing. Evil Dead 2 feels like Sam Raimi thought what if Ed Wood had directed The Evil Dead? Raimi's direction is so exaggerated and unhinged that I'm impressed he could come up with so many wild shots. I prefer the slightly more serious tone of The Evil Dead that also has irreverent humor and startling black comedy with Raimi's fog filled direction and innovative shots. However, Evil Dead 2 is just as great and inventive with the strangest and fiercest vision for filmmaking you can imagine. It's a funny black comedy and a fearsome horror movie when it wants to try harder.\n\nWriters Sam Raimi and Scott Spiegel reimagine The Evil Dead, but with a bigger budget for all of the outstanding practical effects. There's bloody gore again, but with a sillier tone to keep Evil Dead 2 lighthearted most of the time. The story redoes The Evil Dead to start Evil Dead 2 with Ash possessed and insane. Every angle to shoot a film is used within Evil Dead 2. I swear this has to be one of the most creative and fun loving movies ever crafted. Sam Raimi really outdid himself with the outlandish visuals and playful ideas.\n\nPeter Deming's cinematography looks incredible with these moody establishing wide shots of the fog covered cabin in the woods to the intense close-ups. The way the camera rushes of wind through the forest or the house like the evil spirit is chasing Ash is exhilarating every time it appears. Editor Kaye Davis uses the fastest cutting style for all of Evil Dead 2's chaotic and sharp cuts. It's incredible and mind boggling that she put together all these seemingly unrelated shots into such a coherent and pleasant horror comedy for the ages.\n\nBruce Campbell's magnetic charisma, sheer will power, perfect comedic timing, suave heroism, and ruthless violence as Ashley J. Williams is a pleasure to watch during Evil Dead 2. He gets to talk to himself, cut off his own hand, and rave with a mad lunacy we hope to never experience. Bruce Campbell earned his cult classic horror icon status with The Evil Dead, then charmed viewers once more with his erratic and captivating hero Ash. Campbell is beloved for his genius comedic delivery of lines like, \"Groovy\" with total seriousness or his visceral violence against the paranormal beings surrounding Ash and Annie.\n\nSarah Berry is lovely and sympathetic as Annie Knowby. She is as smart and violent as Ash, which makes Annie Knowby a fantastic final girl until the last second she's on screen. What a neat heroine Sarah Berry plays as she brings Annie to life with a cool confidence, panicked screams, vicious attacks, and intelligent occult whispering. Kassie DePaiva is captivating as the redneck girl with an attitude named Bobby Joe. She's very pretty and intriguing as she roams around the forest with her idiotic boyfriend Jake, whom Dan Hicks portrays with a zeal for intense reactions.\n\nArt direction from Randy Bennett and Philip Duffin creates genuinely beautiful haunting moonlit nights to shine down upon Raimi's cabin in the woods. All the smoky fog builds atmosphere and suspense until the ghosts arrive en masse to terrify Ash. Elizabeth Moore's set decoration crafts a Necronomicon, book of the dead, among all the rocking chairs and woodland furniture. Everything looks dusty and ancient by design. All the ruined wood and occult ritual offerings really tie the cabin's aesthetic together nicely.\n\nComposer Joseph LoDuca returns to score Evil Dead 2 with a similar grandeur to his symphonic orchestrations and a playful whimsy for the more comedic moments throughout the day. The fierce sound design is pretty wild with voices echoing from all over to sound more spectral when a character is being haunted by one of the ghosts. Wendy Bell and Mike Trcic's make-up wounds look wonderfully realistic as well as for all the ghostly faces throughout Evil Dead 2.\n\nIn short, Evil Dead 2 is another horror comedy masterpiece from Sam Raimi featuring some of his most daring direction ever. It's 84 brief minutes of astonishing creativity, clever wit, and fun loving playfulness. Evil Dead 2 is the perfect spooky and cute horror picture to start of Halloween season with Raimi's black comedy and grotesque horror images, then you'll see some serious chainsaw and shotgun action.",

            "content": "To whoever owned Prime Time Video, I am sorry that I bootlegged this VHS from your store in 1989 or so, because I was renting it so much that I wanted to watch it every single day. It was years until I saw\u00a0Evil Dead\u00a0and this movie formed so much of what I wanted out of movies. A camera that flew through walls, actors willing to destroy themselves to entertain you and geysers of bottomless buckets of gore.\n\nDino De Laurentiis put up the money and asked that the film be similar to its predecessor. Director Sam Raimi and writer Scott Spiegel must have thought, \"We'll show him,\" and totally remade the first movie but whereas that one had no budget and felt like some maniacs in the woods near Detroit, this had a budget and felt like, yeah, some maniacs in the woods near Detroit.\n\nThis one replays the first one in like five minutes: Ash Williams (the returning Bruce Campbell) and his girlfriend Linda head to a cabin for the weekend, but instead of romance, they find the tapes of\u00a0archaeologist Raymond Knowby and the words from Necronomicon Ex-Mortis that bring demons to their little lovers' log cabin. Linda gets possessed, Ash decapitates her with a shovel and then proceeds to go bonkers for most of the movie.\n\nMost of the movie is Campbell battling himself, his own hand -- and later body -- turning against him. It's the kind of movie where a man can chainsaw off his on hand and then make a chainsaw appendage, say \"Groovy\" and it's somehow -- even years and years later -- cool.\n\nSpiegel and Raimi wrote most of the film in a house in Silver Lake that they shared with the Coen brothers, Frances McDormand, Kathy Bates and Holly Hunter, who the character of Bobby Jo is inspired by.\n\nI'm looking forward to seeing this at the drive-in this weekend if only to feel the sheer joy I once had watching this. I've never seen it surrounded by others and can't wait to see how others react to it. I know that it's gone from a small movie to an accepted classic in the years since I watched it every day, but it's still that movie I copied all those many, many years ago.",

Where Evil Dead (1981) was unsettling with its horror, Evil Dead II (1987) increases that unsettling feeling with the horror and adds that comedy into the mix. It can be such an odd experience watching as you half freaked out, and half comedically amused.\n\nYour enjoyment of Evil Dead II (1987) will determine if you like Sam Raimi as a director, as this personifies his work and him as a director, embracing the whacky side of horror. It is a film you have to embrace, and to be honest it is quite hard not to. It is bigger than its predecessor, like most sequels are, however bigger does equal better on this occasion as the gore and violence is increased as well as the range of practical and special effects.\n\nYou will not be bored watching Evil Dead II (1987), it is such a unique film, especially in the genre with how it makes you feel, and to top it all off it has a very surprising, yet intriguing ending.",

The effects are noticeably better than Evil Dead and the gore is plentiful but still some of the effects leave a little to be desired. It is a fun movie that has echoes of the 1950's b movies but with much more gore. It takes some of the tropes and the dark elements of Evil Dead as well as the main character and then comedically mixes them together. What you get is a fun rollercoaster ride that is not a horror film but almost a full parody of the original Evil Dead. Worth watching but don't go into this thinking you are going to watch a sequel to Evil Dead.",

Although the film is a continuation, the story is essentially a remake of the first film, but with a bigger budget, better special effects, and better actors. The key players return for the sequel, notably director/co-writer Sam Raimi and lead actor Bruce Campbell as Ash, both much more polished at this point in their careers. Filmed seven years after the original, Raimi had directed the bigger budgeted Coen Brother scripted comedy \"Crimewave\" and Campbell had three films under his belt (including an appearance in \"Crimewave\"). Two other talented folks who joined the sequel. One was cinematographer Peter Deming, his first film, who'd go on to become Raimi's regular DP as well as going on to shoot major films such as \"Twin Peaks\", \"Mulholland Drive\", and \"From Hell\". The other major addition this sequel was special effects artists Howard Berger, Robert Kurtzman, and Greg Nicotero, who following their work on \"Evil Dead 2\" formed KNB EFX, who have done everything from \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" to \"The Walking Dead\" to \"Reservoir Dogs\" to \"Misery\". Beyond the film being superior to the original on a technical level, it's much funnier far more clever than the original. The dancing stop motion skeleton doing a Fred Astaire-like dance, Ash doing battle with his own severed hand, or this hilarious ending that sets things up for a wonderfully absurd sequel all make this film a very cheeky take on horror film tropes. Campbell really ups his comedy chops for this sequel, particularly when it comes to some very funny slapstick bits involving his hand \"turning bad\" and his mock heroic moments (which he'd go one to perfect in the third film in the series). The practical special effects and the complete absences of CGI offers old school horror fans a lot of nostalgia and retro charm as well, particularly director Sam Raimi's brother, Ted Raimi, as the Possessed Henrietta in the torn hag suit. Those are the parts everyone remembers about \"Evil Dead II\" but the sexy tobacco chewing Bobby Joe, played by Kassie Wesley, is a lot of fun, as is her hillbilly boyfriend Jake, played by Dan Hicks. Interestingly, Bobby Joe was inspired by Holly Hunter, who was a roommate of Raimi in the 80s along with Joel Coen and Frances McDormand. He wrote the part for Hunter, but producers overruled him and wanted someone \"sexier\". Overall, \"Evil Dead II\" is a classic. It's more openly comedic than the first film, but still manages to be scary and is a rollercoaster of fun, even if it is absolute fluff. FUN FACT! When Kurt Russell first met Bruce Campbell on the set of \"Escape from L.A.\" the first think he said to Bruce was, \"Say 'work shed'\".",

But this one is worth the watch, if nothing else than for the scene at about the 30-minute mark where the protagonist (played by Bruce Campbell) cuts off his demonically possessed hand with a chainsaw, later on attaching said chainsaw to the amputated stump by means of a contraption hastily crafted in the cabin's garage.

The problem here is that it is almost exactly the same as the 1st film, The Evil Dead, but worse and lower budget. Is it a bad movie really? Yes, and no not really. Some things are awesome, some things are beyond stupid. It's a delicate mix, but the developed charm of the cinematographic style is just Tops. It does some things so well, and it creates an eerie atmosphere and some nasty stuff, and right after the \"recap\" beginning it starts off Very well. It's a horror-comedy, not to be mistaken as a comedy-horror, and It is worth a watch if you like the 1st one For Sure. It is just a shame they bought some rag cabin for 5000 and used it Again for the Entire 2nd movie. Did the first make any money, and this was a cash grab?

Evil Dead II raises the stakes by introducing outright slapstick and one-liners into the mix. Consequently, the \"scare level\" of the movie drops a notch. It is still possible to be unsettled by Evil Dead II, but far less likely than by its predecessor. It's interesting to note the way Ash changes between The Evil Dead and Evil Dead II. In the former, he's a geeky guy who ends up being a reluctant hero of sorts. In the sequel, he's a none-too-bright macho dude who's out to get the \"Dead-ites\". By the end of Evil Dead II, he has an impressive arsenal of weapons, including a sawed-off shotgun and a chainsaw. Evil Dead 2 is a worthy sequel to the first Evil Dead, but the tone is so different you must go in with a perspective. ",

There is little to no plot and the film only loosely follows the original film's story while essentially copying every scene (such as the bridge getting taken out, tree rape scene, etc.) It did keep me entertained, so I'll give it that (favorite scene was the chalk outline of the chainsaw), but the frenetic pacing of the scenes gave me anxiety that had nothing to do with horror and I was a little glad that it's a shorter film.",

So at a certain point I don't understand how it could ever lose.\n\nEvil Dead II constantly feels like they had all these different gory effects, special creature models, and ugly masks lying around and just threw them all in randomly. You could almost play this film on random shuffle and it wouldn't change much. Bruce Campbell goes all out in his performance. I kind of wavered between hating and loving his character, but I think some of that's intentional.\n\nRaimi uses some neat camera tricks to build tension, but the first person camera chase gets overused a lot in Evil Dead II. Perhaps the biggest reason I didn't like this movie was because I didn't find it funny. I think there's plenty of weirdness going on, but it's never straight-up irreverent or silly. Again, I didn't HATE the film, it's just one that was not at all made for me. I think I see what others enjoy, but those things didn't work for me.",

(Except, again, the awfully cheap jump scares, which is just a talentless way of scaring the audience) The acting is horrendous and hammy (yet again), there is no atmospheric tension (yet again), and the movie's scares solely rely on jump scares and gore, which is the worst kind of horror, the plot is extremely simple yet it has many plot holes (Less than the first one however), the solution to the film's main problem is abominable (It made even less sense than in the first one), the structure/ outline of the story is pretty bad too. It is cheesy, silly and poorly made, with awful acting and many filming and continuity errors.\n\nI have nothing more to say, except that i'm even less excited for ''Army of Darkness'' than i was after watching ''The Evil Dead''",

Its beats are certainly too similar to the original's though which is really the only issue with this otherwise classic film.\n\nIt  feels more like a reboot or re-imagining than a strict sequel and, as it's essentially the same film as the first one in many ways. That's unfortunate firstly because it takes away from seeing this after just seeing the first and secondly, because, um, this one is better and kind of renders the first null and void. Okay, so it's not that extreme but still, 'Evil Dead 2' could have been every bit as good as it is without also being so repetitive. \n\nStill, it's so much fun- movies are rarely this much fun. I'd pick this over just about any conventional comedy flick that you throw at me. It's hard to really care about the film's repetition when I'm continuously grinning like a sugar-fueled child whilst watching it. \n\nHere's what should happen- there should be another Evil Dead and it should star Nic Cage and then no other film will ever need to be made. One can dream.",

            "content": "Evil Dead II is a sequel to Sam Raimi's first film The Evil Dead, also directed and co-written by Sam Raimi, and it stars Bruce Campbell in a comedy horror film about Ash and his girlfriend going to a cabin, they accidentally summoned a creature that is unknown to the outer world, and it possessed his girlfriend. Ash killed her, and realized that he couldn't get out, so he has to find out a way to get out. Even though The Evil Dead is the scariest movie that I've seen, I watched Evil Dead II more than the first one, and the reason that still is the same reason, is that Evil Dead II is surprisingly better than the first movie. The weird thing about it, is that even though it's better, it's not the scariest film that I've seen. The reason for that, is that the movie focused on not only the horror, but the humor too. It has a great balance of them, but the only way for me to think that way, is if the movie is just a horror film, that's it. I know that the first one is supposedly a horror film with some dark comedy in it, but I think I took it more seriously on the \"black comedy\" parts. Anyway, back to the movie. The acting is an improvement from the first one, and the writing is impressive. The direction by Sam Raimi is excellent in it that I have no idea how he did that in some scenes. There are more special effects in it, and it really cool to look at that they really took the time with their vision to come true. The plot is more well thought out, and the character development is better than the first movie. The score Joseph LoDuca is very creepy, and the action scenes are always great to watch. Evil Dead II is a rare sequel that is better than the first film that is a horror classic to me.",

If it's a sequel then the recap of the opening doesn't fit together with the first film and thus continuity-wise is just sloppy and confusing. But if this is actually a reboot, the opening still doesn't work because it seems really rushed if we're supposed to pretend the first film didn't happen and this is a fresh new timeline we're being introduced to. And why call the film Evil Dead II if it's a reboot?\n\nAs with the first film, I find this one despite its moments of brilliance to be overrated. The moments that are brilliant are genuinely brilliant and hilarious, and in this film we see Ash starting to show the characteristics of the character we've all come to know and love. But in terms of plot and story all I can say is Evil Dead II comes off as damn sloppy. The funny moments are genuinely funny and brilliant, but stringing some funny moments together doesn't necessarily make for a functioning narrative or movie.\n\n6,5/10",

It starts off with what seems like a recap of what happened in the first movie. But, some things are missing. In this version Ash and Linda came to the cabin alone, without the other 3 friends. I don't see the reason behind this, honestly. Anyways, the actual story of the 2nd movie starts literally where the first one ended and from there on it's one hilarious and brutal ride! This part is much more humorous than the first one, although less gory, but with much better practical effects, as well as few obvious cgi ones. And that's exactly the reason why I prefer this one over the first one. It's much less serious and has some truly hilarious scenes that will make you laugh out loud! The acting is also noticeably better. The characters are okay. No improvements, except in Ash, who is becoming more and more likeable! The direction is, again, amazing! The camera work is fantastic! I really love the look of this movie. All in all, a truly brilliant sequel to an already amazing movie that delivers on every level!

This was due to the fact that the original was owned by another production company (the company who released the original in cinemas). So sadly Raimi could not re-use some of his footage shot for the first film, this was re-shot this time dealing with only two characters Ash & his girlfriend. This leads nicely into the film as it practically picks up where the last one left off. Better Writting, Better Production, Better Acting (still some dodgy), & the same creepy atmosphere. This is one of those times when a sequel surpasses its original, an all round better made & more enjoyable film (in my opinion).",

            "content": "I like this movie, but I really wish it wasn't so much of a comedy and that it wasn't a remake. Raimi's first movie was WIthin The Woods. The he did a remake and called it The Evil Dead. Then he did a second remake called Evil Dead 2. Then a comedy set in the past. Now we have a third remake of the same movie. I wonder if we'll ever get a proper sequel? \n\nThe film starts with a remake of The Evil Dead. Events and characters are changed, and it's shorter, but remember that in remakes events are always changed around. After the opening we get a longer version of the story. This still means it's a remake. Look at the remake of Friday The 13th. In the original it's Jason's mom who's doing the killings. In the remake, just like in Evil Dead 2, we get an alternate version of the first movie summed up in 10 minutes at the beginning, and then the movie continues with Jason Voorhees showing up, which didn't happen until Friday The 13th Part 2. But even then the new Friday The 13th movie, what happens in it didn't happen in any other movie. It's a new story. So you'd call Evil Dead 2 a remake for the same reason you wouldn't call Friday The 13th (2009) a sequel. Both are remakes.\n\nWith that said, it's a fun movie. It has the same mood that Ghostbusters has, only this has tons of gore. The only thing that disappoints me about it is wondering what could have been if Raimi had the confidence to make a respectable sequel to his best film. If you look at the way Raimi's career played out it seems the only thing he liked about The Evil Dead was the funny expression on Bruce Campbell's face.",

            "content": "Bloody, silly, but above all, \"Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn\" is an innovative film that puts too many modern horror films to shame. Having never seen Sam Raimi's original two masterpieces of the Evil Dead series until this year, I must express some regret in having waited so long. At the same though, I'm kind of glad that it took me so long to get to \"The Evil Dead\" and its sequel/reboot (there's debate about this: is it a sequel, is it a reboot, or is a rebooted sequel? Who cares, watch the damn thing). Mainly because horror films of the 2010s have budgets comparable or above what Sam Raimi had in the 80s, and yet, all we get these days are jump scares. \"Evil Dead II\" strives for so much more, it's very difficult to put into words. Mainly because the film nails the basic constructs of a horror flick: atmosphere - check, make-up - super check, predictability - absent, blood- you bet, tone of insanity - definitely. Take, for instance, the scene with the stop-motion of Ash's deadite girlfriend, not only was that unexpected, but it looks like a bizarre version of Tim Burton's \"A Nightmare Before Christmas\" (and I'm starting to think Burton was influenced by \"Evil Dead II\"). There's lots of creative moments that you never see coming (one that I really liked was when Ash looks at himself in the mirror.) Not all of the effects look good, especially compared to today's standards, but at least it was an attempt! Seriously, like, why aren't writers/directors watching this and taking notes? I know that studios are merely going by what's \"hip\" and because they know that if they spend a million dollars on a movie and manage to create a compelling trailer that tells you ALL of the movie's plot, then they'll make 3X what they spent by the first weekend. In conclusion: We need MORE Sam Raimi's!!!!!!!!!!!",

The violence and one liners in this movie are hysterical, it was way too goofy for the mood surrounding the movie. One thing I did like more about this one is that there were no annoying zombie girlfriends cackling. Bruce Campbell nails his character in this one like he did in the first and gives a funny but great performance as Ash. The other characters were fun to watch and all but I was way more focused on Ash. The animation was once again very cool and funny (wasn't at the time but is now) and very creative looking. The ending was a bit ridiculous but at least it set itself up for a sequel rather than just ending there.

Then, there is Campbell's amazing physical performance that virtually renders his character a live-action cartoon - also on speed - and deservedly earned the actor cult status. Theodore Raimi is also great as a genuinely freaky possessed old woman.

Raimi has created his own form of directing style within his \"Evil Dead Trilogy\".A directing style that involves a shake-cam that is pushed with maximum impact through it's environment so that it may give it's viewer a roller-coaster feel.This directing style is by far the most entertaining way to interpret a horror film.  \n\nThough the film has a major cult following it is still considered among many film historians and the general public as one of the greatest horror films of all time.The film is very famous for popularizing the horror-comedy genre and is also considered by many to be one of the fathers of horror-comedy films.Regardless of the films comedy status it still manages to deliver us with unstoppable unexpected scares which made the original film a legendary horror masterpiece.The scares (like the original) comes at very unexpected moments and that is what makes the film so exciting!.Another aspect of what makes the film so brilliant is the special effects.The increased special effects done by Vern Hyde, Doug Brunswick and Tom Sullivan must have truly been a groundbreaking achievement for the horror films that came out at the time.\n\nThe film itself could not have been so jaw-dropping if it wasn't for Bruce Campbell's unbelievably iconic performance.Campbell has the ability to be incredibly funny,iconic,lovable goofy and unfathomably cool.Campbell also showed the horror cinema that the protagonist of a horror film can actually be more lovable than the antagonist itself.This film also proves to it's viewer that a horror film can create one of the most iconic figures known to the world of cinema,which tended to be a unbelievable case for some critics.Even the film's leading cast must be admired for going through the trouble of wearing the incredible make-up effects that was created by Mark Shostrom.\n\nThe phenomenal aspect about this film is that every time I show it to a different person they get the exact same reaction to it that the previous person had,and this reaction you will understand once you have seen the film for the first time. In this review I can actually not even express or describe the sheer intensity to what degree I actually love this film.I have seen this film more times than I've seen my favorite film. So what does that actually tell you?--This film will always have an undying love from me that no other film can do.This movie is by far the most entertaining horror movie ever made!.To me its my favorite horror movie of all time and is my second favorite film of all time!. This movie is truly well....Groovy!",

In many ways it tends to feel more cheesy, and has a lot of questionable acting mainly from its secondary characters that at the end dont feel nearly as important or as likeable as the ones in the first movie, but the overall feel and insane premise that the movie offers, is hard to think of tose flaws as anything but puny things that dont really hinder the enjoyment and the bizzarre and often exagerated moments.",

The answer: Make it funnier and gorier. This is not just one of the best horror movies ever made. This is one of the best movies ever made PERIOD. It's constantly funny, constantly gory and the chainsaw hand is just constantly...well, groovy. Ash is a much stronger character than in the first one which is definitely a big improvement which just saw Ash at the sidelines like a coward as his friends become possessed one by one. The scene when Ash's severed hand taunts him will always be my favourite. As with the first film, the practical effects are amazingly good. Because of the bigger budget, they could do a lot more in terms of the effects, even getting Sam Raimi's brother Ted to be Henrietta was awesome. The quotes in the movie have become synonymous in pop culture and shows that you don't need to be Arnold Schwarzenegger to deliver awesome one-liners. Overall, the movie is a massive improvement over its predecessor and gave me high hopes for the third movie which is for another time...",

            "content": "Sam Raimi's Evil Dead 2 is not only an insanely comedic counterpart to its more serious (and tree-rapey) predecessor, but it's a great sequel that keeps what terrified audiences six years beforehand and expands on ideas related to the Necronomicon, a book that, when read aloud, summons the undead. Here, the undead is actually a sole entity with no real flesh until the climax of the movie. The less we talk about that flesh form, the better. It is far more intimidating as this formless being we sometimes see from its own perspective, as it knocks downs trees and doors to reach its target. There's a musical chant that accompanies the being, ascending demonically as it gets closer. When it reaches a target, it torments and swallows the soul of the body, then occupies the body, becoming a zombie. The zombies themselves look like those of Dawn of the Dead, but the Evil Dead franchise is where top-speed zombies are introduced. There are jump scares and there is blood. Blood does not bleed out of bodies. It blows out like an oil well. The first time it happens -- when the hero Ash (Bruce Campbell) shoots his possessed, severed hand -- is timed so well that, despite how sick the red and black blood looks, I laugh.\n\nThe undead can possess inanimate objects too. For the first half hour, Ash is all alone in the cabin, aware of the danger that's waiting to consume him. The undead controls the piano so it plays by itself, a mirror so that Ash can rival his own reflection, and a deer head to taunt Ash when his chair collapses. Ash sometimes wakes up to \"discover\" he was only dreaming. Instead of determining whether his sanity is shattering or the undead is just toying with his mind, I laugh along with the antics. That deer head scene is flat-out slapstick. First, the deer head cackles at Ash, then a lamp, clock, bookcase, every object in the room. Then Ash laughs with the undead, and entertains it some more. For more evidence of slapstick, again, Ash fought his possessed, severed hand, with violence straight out of a Tom and Jerry cartoon. Once other people enter the scene, the film drags for a little while. I don't expect anyone except my hero to live. That's okay, because before the climax, Ash becomes a classic action star by attaching a chainsaw to his handless arm and exclaims some catchphrases. And when a portal is summoned to send the undead to another dimension, the film ends on a science-fiction/fantasy twist you would see in a Twilight Zone episode. I have loved this film for so long that the cons don't mean a thing to me. The fast-paced cinematography, claustrophobic setting, and psychotically silly violence are all I need for comedy-horror.",

            "content": "Honestly, I watched the first Evil Dead movie awhileeee back, so I really don't remember as much as I would have liked to, but I do remember the essential bits. It's not really needed to have the predecessor fresh in the memory for Evil Dead 2, but it probably would have helped. Any way, here's my opinion on the bizarre, blood soaked Evil Dead 2.\n\nThe film is a reprise of the original basically. It's along the same lines when it comes to story, as the movie follows Ash, who has found himself alone in a haunted cabin up in the woods after his girl is taken by the witches and made into one. As Ash fights to fend off the haunted monsters that roam the land of the cabin, the cabin owner's daughter and a party she has brought with her make their way to the cabin, only to find out about the horrors going on. Ash and the rest of the group go insane, in what seems like a never ending battle for life against flesh eating zombie-witches and possessed trees of evil. It's ridiculous horror by Sam Raimi, but there is a ton to like here.\n\nBruce Campbell is one of the many clear cut examples of badasses that Hollywood has to offer, even at the current stage of the game (probably). Here though, is what I always remember him from. It sucks knowing that I had the opportunity to meet the guy at a signing once, but walked right past. If only I watched Evil Dead 2 prior to that day, my ass would have been lined up without thinking. Not to say I love the Evil Dead movies, but some of the stuff in this movie makes Campbell one of the coolest acting icons still around. At the same time, it wouldn't matter what he stars in into the future, I'm always gonna picture the man with a chainsaw for an arm and a boomstick slinged on his back. Sure it's B-Level Acting, but that is the charm of this insanely campy and goofy horror.\n\nWhen it comes to horror, Evil Dead is nothing scary (atleast that's how I feel). To me, it feels like a dark, gorey comedy, and an homage to stereotypical horror movies that seem to rinse and repeat the same premises. It takes this redundant concept and hammers it into your head with over the top screams, eyeballs and fountains of blood. For every serious seeming bit, there's a whole 'nother scene popping out at us to remind us that the whole movie is pretty much a farce. If this is in fact Sam Raimi's initial intention, then he sure is a clever film maker.\n\nAs for the direction, I gotta say I love some of the visuals in this movie. A lot of the crappy effects in terms of the monsters and the stop motion is silly yet smile inducing, and the long single tracking shots in the beginning are actually damn impressive. There are a lot of shots, along with other choices made by Raimi that make the movie succeed in all it's cheesy, campy, glory. The music, the cheap set, the simple, played dialogue. It all works so well, to make this movie feel so cheap and stupid, yet so unique in it's own little way. After watching Evil Dead 2, I thought to myself that no one's really making movies like this anymore. Even if they are, no one's shining a light on this kind of stuff. When it comes down to it, making movies like this are hard, because you tend to toe the fine line between great and god awful. Evil Dead 2 finds a way to tilt in the favor of eye popping and memorable rather than the latter.\n\nEvil Dead 2 is stupid, stupid, horror, but great comedy. It's a bloody farce that's got tons of memorable moments, while being a defining homage to the shocking side of the horror genre.",

Less a sequel and more of Remake-quel, Rami and Co saying \"This is the movie we WANTED to make but didn't have the budget.\"\nBeing the second go around comes with some advantages. A more seasoned Bruce Campbell, higher budget. Last time around seemed more like a cross between a traditional 'woods, teens, slaughter' and the actual vision, where this time around everyone knows what to do and runs with it.\nThere are some things that I enjoy about the original.  It had better make up effects,  the non-Ash characters were a little less bland last time, and it was a significant bit more creepy. But what we get from the  tradeoff has a higher entertainment value in my mind than what was lost.   It expands on the mythos and delves deeper into the back story this time around as well.\nIt almost feels like a dash of a superhero origin story sprinkled on top of everything else this movie has going for it.  Considering that even though Ash is more what I expected this time around, he really doesn't  get to the chain-saw arm, hacked off shoot-gun toting Ash of Legend till the end. Speaking of the end, I would have loved to have seen the reaction to people that didn't know where this was headed, and how out of nowhere it must of felt to the Audience back in 87. It's so unpredictable, gutsy and BEGS for a sequel.\n\nHorror takes a back seat to off the wall effects.  The thing is a cartoon and that is by no means a bad thing. In fact it's a good thing, a very very good thing. What else more is there to say besides 'Groovy.'",

            "content": "Sam Raimi already gave us one of the most iconic horror films ever devised by man so what does he do next? he gives us the sequel which is even more iconic than the previous film!. 'Gimme some sugar baby'...oh wait that's the third most iconic horror film ever.\n\nSo up to a few years ago I was a little confused by this sequel. The plot appears to show 'Ash' venturing back up to a remote cabin with another girlfriend, was this the original cabin or a completely new one? I asked myself. As things progress (very quickly) Ash discovers yet another recorder which he plays and inadvertently sets the dark demonic forces free again. It was at this point I was thinking why on earth Ash would do that? didn't he learn from his first cabin experience? and when you think about it why the hell would he go back to a remote cabin?! dude seriously!.\n\nTwas then I found out that this sequel is actually a reboot of the first film, yet Raimi called it Evil Dead 2 as though its a continuation of the first. The plot is exactly the same as the first film because its a remake basically, a remake with better effects, more action and less build up...essentially more game time. Ash is even wearing the same outfit he had on in the first film!. So yes that is a bit confusing if you're not in the know but somehow it doesn't matter, the film is so damn fun you let it slide. Myself I think he should of avoided the 2 in the title and tried to make it follow the first but hey.\n\nAs I said there's no messing around in this film, no sooner has Ash arrived at the cabin he's released the demons and all hell is breaking loose. This is good as we know the basic outline from the first film, everybody simply wanted to see more of Ash kicking undead ass. And that is exactly what we get with much sweeter looking effects.\n\nThe effects are much the same type of thing as in the first but due to success and extra mula they are simply better. Of course by today's standards they aren't that good, a bit basic, any fresh faced kids are gonna laugh at most of it truth be told. But again its the old adage that with little money and tech you've gotta work to make your film look good. You've gotta be inventive and once again Raimi and co excel with their visuals. A nice blend of classic makeup, mask work, models, stop motion, bluescreen, miniatures, puppets etc...the full gamut of special effects to bring every creature alive in the best possible way.\n\nPersonally I loved the sequence where 'Linda's' corpse rises from the grave and then dances around in the swirling bleak mist as Ash watches in horror from the cabin. The whole scene is using classic stop motion and even though it of course looks a bit hokey the atmosphere is just so flippin eerie. It could almost be a Tim Burton moment. There is so much to enjoy here, chock full of tasty visual kookiness, the severed hand that scrambles around, the excellent possessed makeup jobs on the survivors and Campbell especially and then there's the huge demon head/face thing at the end. Corny as hell but so much fun.\n\nIts also no secret that this sequel was taken down the horror comedy route. The first film was suppose to be an all out horror but this started down that surreal goofy route which has now become so legendary. Not for the most part though, most of the film is still very dark, some of the demonic sequences are clearly more slapstick but its still evil looking. Its only when the last female survivor crafts Ash's chainsaw onto his bloody stump along with his shoulder mounted shotgun do we finally cross over fully into the comic book/graphic novel genre. Its at this moment that Ash becomes a superhero of sorts and enters into the world of merchandise.\n\nDoes this mood swing cause any problems? no, no it doesn't, in fact it just makes the film even more awesome and gives it a whole new scope. We go from classic horror gore with Ash being the victim in all manner of slapstick tomfoolery, to action man gore and violence with the start of ice cool witty quips and full on hero posing.\n\nIt is strange how this franchise developed no doubt about that, plus the oddity of rebooting/remaking his first film virtually scene by scene and calling it a sequel. Like the first its not really scary but this time it was never meant to be scary, its a wild ride bordering on fantasy that happens to have a lot of blood and goo. Its one of those perfect 'sequels' where everything is just right, it all works...even the bits that kinda don't work, work. There are moments of great horror and moments that are almost childish in nature, you could even say its a satire of certain grotty horrors. End of the day Campbell can simply make these things work.\n\nNo excuses here, its a balls to the wall, hyper demonic blood n ooze frenzy with typically gritty low budget ferocity and absurd creations. A completely cheesy turbo charged B-movie of diabolically hellish proportions, you wanted it you got it...and its groovy baby.",

Instead, I will write one-to-two-paragraph long blurbs and post them as my reviews. If you want them expanded upon, please comment, and I will then write a full review for them. As always, recent movies that are still in theaters or came out this year will get full reviews.\r\n\r\nIf I were to sum up the Evil Dead franchise in one word, it would be \"dumb.\" Sam Raimi, following up his cult classic (why it's considered a classic, I'll never know) gives us Evil Dead 2, easily the number-one horror movie to watch if you feel like laughing incredulously. It's billed as a horror/comedy, but there's nothing in it to make you laugh, and those who DO laugh at it miss the point that the movie doesn't seem to be intentionally funny. Which puts it on the same level as... dare I say it? The Room.\r\n\r\nThis campy, ugly, obnoxious carbon-copy of the original film is unmemorable and uninventive in every way. Its plot is virtually identical to the first movie (you'd think that Ash Williams would have learned his lesson by now and stayed away from cabins in the woods), the effects are even cheesier, and the dialogue is absolutely fucking atrocious. There are scenes where you get the feeling that Raimi just told his actors to look suddenly around the set, acting terrified. That's not even acting. That's just looking mildly frightened. By the time we get to the plot with Ash's Evil Hand, we couldn't care less.\r\n\r\nFinal Score for Evil Dead 2: 4/10 stars. I see very little redeeming value in this intrinsically, but just as with The Room, it's fun to watch it for how mind-fuckingly inept it is on every level. The acting is vomit-inducing, the story is retarded, and the special effects look better suited to Jason and the Argonauts than a sequel to a highly successful horror movie made in 1987. Seriously, this came out AFTER Star Wars. Altogether, it sucks on every level. Watch the shit out of it.",

            "content": "There is nary a film saga in the horror genre more fun then the Evil Dead trilogy. With the first one being a benchmark of independent filmmaking and pretty good blend of camp and genuine horror, Evil Dead 2 had a lot to live up to. It does in every way though, and in the process of making this film Raimi created a classic for decades to come. As I just mentioned camp, right off the bat don't expect this movie to be serious. It's a horror COMEDY, but a little more subtle about it the Zombieland or Shaun of the Dead.\n\nEvil Dead 2 \"picks up\" where the first left off, but not after retelling the first movie (this time with just Ash and his girlfriend) in the first 10 minutes. For those who don't know, Ash and his girlfriend drive up to a cabin in the woods for a fun weekend together. While there, they find a recording that when they play back summons an evil spirit. This evil spirit possesses the girl and As has to kill her. Holed up in this cabin with no way to escape, Ash fights to survive and keep his insanity until two couples show up to invite more trouble.\n\nSam Raimi is a brilliant director, not necessarily because he's great with actors (although to be fair he helped mold Bruce Campbell into a fairly decent one), but because of his brilliant camera and effects work. This movie looks really quite good, with camera angles that make me practically orgasm I love them so much. Raimi is the master of perpetuating mood, if that mood is right and Evil Dead 2 never looses that feeling of bat-shit insanity that Raimi intended. The lighting works extremely well too, with the woods being spooky and the film in general having that undeniably VHS era feel to it.\n\nThe effects are phenomenal, even when they suck. It makes me nostalgic for the era of practical effects (even if I was never there) because with the same budget, the cgi would have looked worse. Raimi uses stop motion at several points in the movie and stop motion at it's worse still has a creepy vibe because of how disjointed it is. CGI when it's low budget looks like shit, so even if stop-motion looks bad it's still better. The blood, makeup and various body part movements look amazing, much better then the original. There are a few effects that don't work that well and actually could have used some CG but there never going to pull you out of the movie.\n\nEvil Dead 2 is a funny ass movie, but it still manages to pull off scares. You'll be laughing at Ash one second, cheering him on the next and fearing for him the next. It's really a roller coaster, but it does require you to understand what it's trying to do. The story is generic, the acting is mediocre, and the inconsistent tone on top of that is what's going to turn people off. However, if you go into Evil Dead expecting to not take it too seriously then the comedy will be all the funnier and the scares will be all the more unexpected.\n\nEvil Dead 2 hits all the right marks for me. It pokes at horror tropes, exaggerates to the extreme, has beautiful cinematography and features a protagonist that I will forever root for. Ash is one of the world's greatest badasses and the shit that he goes through in this night makes for some of the most unique viewing you will ever experience. If you're looking for a fun Halloween movie to watch with your friends or without, then grab the popcorn and pop in Evil Dead 2! Evil Dead 2 is available on Netflix instant and Amazon Instant or your local video store (remember those?).\ngo to mentalmultiverse.wordpress.com for more reviews!",

            "content": "Evil Dead 2 the sequel to an original(and funny) film. \nI guess the biggest question of the film is this : Is it BETTER,Worse or ON PAR with the first? The answer? it's Probably better but IDK but it's DEF on par.\nI enjoyed this film..maybe not as much as the first but enough that I wouldn't give it a lower ratting. \nThe film begins with a revised recap of the events of the first film. Ash Williams and his girlfriend Linda take a romantic vacation to a seemingly abandoned cabin in the woods. While in the cabin, Ash plays a tape of an archaeology professor (the cabin's previous inhabitant), reciting passages from the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis (or Book of the Dead), which he has discovered during an archaeological dig. The recorded incantation unleashes an evil force which kills and later possesses Linda. Ash is then forced to decapitate his girlfriend for his own safety. After he buries Linda, a spirit is seen hunting for Ash. The film then picks up with Ash becoming briefly possessed by the demon, but when day breaks the spirit is gone, and Ash is back to normal.\nAt first, he is mistaken for a murderer by the four people because he shoots at them through the door (mistaking them as the Evil Force), but they find out the truth after listening to a recording of Annie's father, Professor Knowby, that talked about how his wife Henrietta was possessed and buried in the cabin's cellar rather than dismembered. Ed is possessed and is soon killed by Ash. Bobby Joe tries to escape, but is attacked by the demon trees and dragged to her death. Annie translates two of the pages before Jake turns on them and throws the pages into the cellar, holding them at gunpoint to force them to go look for Bobby Joe. Ash is possessed once again and turns on his remaining companions, incapacitating Jake. Annie retreats to the cabin and accidentally stabs Jake (mistaking him for the demon) and drags him to the cellar door, where he is killed by Henrietta in a bloodbath. Ash tries to kill Annie, but returns to normal when he sees Linda's necklace, reminding him of her.\nI liked how the film started off DIRECTLY where the first one started,Ash is walking away and we find out what happened to him, Wich is nice instead of giving us this long..boring  \"Previously\" type story at the beginning it just jumps right into the action. Granted this might make it hard for people who haven't seen the first to enjoy this one but..MEah\nThe films got basically the same things in it that worked in the first and makes them better. Basicaly the producer's and Director's Idea was..if It Ain't broken why fix it? and I concur. They did how ever make the make up effects WAY better in this one from the possessed  woman to the creepy creatures they just look more...fleshed out in this one.  \nThey also made some VERY memorable scenes,and this time for the right reasons, \nTake for example the scene where Ash has to fight his well...own hand. It sounds ridiculous but when you see it in the film it not only works it's HILARIOUS. Watching it I couldn't help but laugh my ass off at the effects and also the humor of seeing Ash be like \"DIE YOU FUCKING HAND\"  there's even more BLACK humor in the film that is just great. There's a scene near the end where a eyeball is shot right into a woman's open mouth now...it sounds gross but it's HILARIOUS. to watch. There is one scene in the film that's bad though but not in the..way of a low point. There's a scene where a man get's eaten by the evil spirits and in all honesty it's too Cheesy to be bad but also too bad to be good. IDK it didn't ruin the film for me but it's def..an unnecessary part in it.\nAll in all this is a GREAT sequel and can easily be considered on of the best in the series,even if it needs the first needs to be seen for this one to make sense,",

            "content": "They're back and deader than ever... so they're probably not going to be too much of a challenge this time around. Yeah, I reckon that, \"Evil\" adjective really does make a good bit of difference, because you're usual corpse isn't going to put up much of a fight, but if you emphasize that these are demons we're dealing with here, then things are starting to sound more hardcore. Shoot, forget the \"Evil\" part in the title, you could just toss in the \"Dead by Dawn\" subtitle for this film that they all too often don't use, because that is one cool subtitle, even if it does scream hardcore metal band almost as loudly and obnoxiously as a hardcore metal band. So yeah, this film's title is pretty hardcore, as is the film itself, but don't get too excited, people, because where \"The Evil Dead\" was straight brutality, this film actually gets a touch more tongue-in-cheek in order to lighten the mood or something. That's right, folks, when this sequel doesn't stay too faithful to the narrative of its predecessor that it actually revises, it betrays the predecessor's full degree of intensity with slapstick humor, so how could this possibly go, Sam Raimi. Shoot, as questionable as some of the human behavior in the first \"Evil Dead\" was, it may as well as have more been a comedy or something, but with this film, yeah, Raimi really doesn't make that much pretense, even though I can think of some people who would say that with this film, Raimi has earned the right to gloat a bit. I, on the other hand, respect this film, and certainly find that it works better than it could have, but am noticing some issues here.\r\n\r\nReally, when you refer to this film as a sequel, you're more-or-less using the term rather loosely, because if nothing else is unique about this follow-up to a unique classic of sorts, it's the idea of rebooting the narrative, which is refreshed and revised entirely with this effort, - at least for the first act that removes and reintroduces characters and plot elements in a new light - yet still doesn't take full advantage of its loose interpretation of its own mythology, following more than a few of the same beats of its predecessor, or rather, \"source material\", and giving you a greater opportunity to see the elements in this story that aren't so refreshing. If there were clich\u00e9s in the original \"The Evil Dead\", then most of them were obscured by originality that ultimately prevailed in bringing the predecessor about as much life as it can gain as a horror flick riddled with natural shortcomings, yet with this loose sequel/remake, in spite of some new refreshing elements, originality has gone stale enough for you to get the bitter taste of the conventionalism, which in turn allows you to sink your teeth further into other shortcomings in the story concept. Like I said, the original's story was too riddled with natural shortcoming for the final product to go all that far as enjoyable, and while this film is arguably more realized in its storytelling, with more layers and attention to substance, rather than style, it too has a certain minimalism to its subject matter that limits effectiveness, further betrayed by errors in Sam Raimi's interpretation of an improvable story concept. The film not only revises its mythology, but also revises its tone, juggling much of the same intensity that powered its predecessor, sometimes with a hint of dramatic weight, if you can believe it, but still leaving room for comedy elements that range from cleverly subtle to just about gleefully absurdist, and I commend Raimi for having the guts to try and tickle your gut while others' guts are being spilled (There are a lot of guts in this film, make no mistake), yet there are times where the film gets confused and jars between its tonal layers, whose extremes go diluted by tonal unevenness, as surely as they go tainted by pacing unevenness. Another aspect that cut down the predecessor was blanding atmospheric dryness, and while this film sustains enough liveliness to keep you far away from all-out boredom throughout its course, limp, maybe even quiet moments in atmospheric kick stiffen pacing, giving you the opportunity to notice the dragging in the plot structuring of this film, which, at a mere 84 minutes, would appear to not have any time to lose, but ultimately finds itself going bloated with excess filler that drags things along, little by little, until focus starts to fade, both within the film and perhaps even the audience. The film is fun and has a lot to commend, more so than its predecessor, but for every misstep it patches up after \"The Evil Dead\", it takes on a new scratch to help you in soaking up the weight limitations that ultimately drive the final product into relative underwhelmingness. Nevertheless, the film is enjoyable, (You know, if you don't mind blood and guts and whatnot) being almost as messy as it is, well, messy, (Blood and guts and whatnot) but not without its share of strengths, even in the score department.\r\n\r\nReturning from \"The Evil Dead\", Joseph LoDuca turns in a score that is lacking in uniqueness, but abandons much of the blasted '70s/'80s electronic sensibilities that watered down much of the effectiveness of LoDuca's still generally effective score for the last film, replacing it with more sweep and liveliness, broken by a faithfulness to the minimalist brood that made LoDuca's score for the predecessor generally quite effective, and when it comes to the efforts of cinematographer Peter Deming, Tim Philo's replacement, filming definition is relatively sharper, as is filming style, which is more tasteful with its sparse lighting plays, as well as even more dynamic and stylish with its lively camerawork. The nifty filming style that this film explores is not only more immersive than the cinematography of the predecessor, but really compliments the dynamicity of the action sequences, not unlike Gregory Nicotero's special effects, which are a bit improvable in retrospect, but generally pretty outstanding, with a fair amount of convincingness and a great amount of conceptual liveliness, particularly when it comes to the over-the-top gore effects that may prove to be quite disturbing, but, to those willing to try and stomach the nastiness, creatively liven up the intense violence that in turn livens up a sense of consequence. Stylistically and technically, the film really steps up from its predecessor, whose style and technical value played key roles in keeping the film going as decent, so the aesthetic touch-ups, alone, bring the final product to the brink of rising above \"The Evil Dead\", while relatively sharper acting aspects all but solidify the sequel as superior. Now, acting material is still pretty limited, as you can imagine, but the tonal layers augment opportunities for lively performances that are, in fact, done justice, with charisma that can be found across the board, but especially within leading man Bruce Campbell, who, with this film, really defines the iconic Ash Williams character, not just with his charisma, but with a surprising amount of layered depth that sells Williams as an ordinary man who shall suffer through sorrow and terror on his path to assuming a heroic role. When material picks up, at least for Campbell, our leading man carries the film, and while that's not to say that Campbell is truly excellent, it is to say that Campbell is stronger than you'd expect him to be as the lead in a film like this, which isn't to say that there isn't some potential in this film to do justice. This film's story concept is too similar to the subject matter of both the predecessor and other horror flick's of this nature, and is therefore rich with natural limitations in meat and momentum, further watered down by inconsistencies in tone and pacing, but as surely as there was plenty of intrigue and uniqueness within \"The Evil Dead\", this follow-up still has much intrigue and refreshingness to spare, partly because of the film's being redefined as a comedy horror, brought to life about as much as it can be by Sam Raimi's script, - which delivers on anything from colorful, if mostly blood-red slapstick, to near-biting satire - as well as by Raimi's direction, whose effective areas in atmospheric playfulness soak up the core of the tonal layers enough to sell both tension and liveliness. Really, the film is pretty fun, and while fun isn't enough to drive the final product into a rewarding state, combined with stylistic, technical and acting strength behind refreshing and generally effective storytelling, secure the effort as quite decent, if improvable.\r\n\r\nWhen it's all said and done... again, the final product is too much like its predecessor and other films of its type, as well as too uneven in tone and pacing, for you to ignore the natural shortcomings, which ultimately drive the final product into underwhelmingness, challenged more than I expected by lively score work, excellently stylish cinematography, outstanding special effects, - particularly when it comes to the creative gore - surprisingly good acting, - especially from leading man Bruce Campbell - and generally effective writing and direction that do enough justice to a generally refreshing and lively story concept for \"Evil Dead II\", or, if you will, \"Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn\" (I'm telling you, that is one cool subtitle), to stand as a flawed, but tense and fun comedic thriller.\r\n\r\n2.75/5 - Decent",

I think the original Evil Dead is a great low-budget horror film. But this film, despite notably higher production values, just fails as both a comedy and as a horror film on anything but the level of inspiring some revulsion at its use of gore. And splatter. Bruce Campbell (Ash) beating himself up once his hand becomes possessed provides some mild amusement, but it resembles more a live-action cartoon than an actual horror movie. I only give it the 2.5 because (1) it's key place in the splatter for laughs sub-genre, and (2) Sam Raimi attended Michigan State University. But for those two factors, the film would \"earn\" maybe 1.5 stars. But Evil Dead, the first one, that is one fine film.",

It's a sequel to the 1981 film \"The Evil Dead\" but that and the main character is about all they have in common. I was really unsure of whether or not to give this film a 5/5. I mean, how could I give such a cheesy, over the top, ridiculous movie a perfect score? And that's the answer. The first movie was cheesy and over the top while trying to take itself seriously. It honestly thought that it was a horror movie and while I loved it for what it was Evil Dead 2 realized that people wanted the tacky one liners and over the top blood. It was the 80's, what did you expect? With that said Evil Dead 2 accomplishes the laughs and if you stop laughing at the stupidity of it, you'll actually some pretty creepy images. There's one scene where a tree comes to life and tries to kill Ash (the main character) it has three human faces coming out of it, covered in some dark blood like liquid. That sounds pretty freaky, sadly for me I was too busy laughing at Bruce Campbell's amazing portrayal of Ash to take notice at first. While this film might be stated as a horror comedy, it's not. Take out the horror and throw in the word \"dark.\" Saying it's a horror comedy means that people will expect to be scared however, if you're over the age of nine you will most likely not be scared by this film, and you're not supposed to be. The movie is supposed to entertain with the crazy amount of one liners, violence, and blood. And it succeeds in every aspect.

While the original \"Evil Dead\" in 1981 already proved this, \"Evil Dead 2\" is much more gory, and adds even more humor, if that's possible.  This sequel is the definition of in your face horror, but it's so gosh darn entertaining that when you're not scared, you're laughing, or vice versa.  At this point in the game, Sam Raimi was still young, but no director at the time could work with a low-budget in the way that he can.\n\tThe film begins with a condensed recap of what happened earlier-- we find that Ash (Bruce Campbell) and his girlfriend Linda (Denise Bixler) are going to that famous dark cabin in the woods ... the Book of the Dead is discovered ... Linda becomes possessed ... and then Ash is forced to kill her.  \n\tFrom then on, \"Evil Dead 2\" stands alone.  The film jumps to an airport, where we meet Annie (Sarah Berry), the daughter of the people that own the cabin (and the ones responsible for awakening the dead), and her professor boyfriend Ed (Richard Domeier).  The twosome plan on visiting Annie's parents, but upon a rival they find that the bridge has mysteriously been destroyed.  They enlist the help of two rednecks, Jake (Dan Hicks) and Bobby Joe (Kassie DePaiva) to guide them along the alternate trail to the came.\n\tWhen they show up, Ash has battled a slew of evil spirits, and is a complete mess.  Annie, seeing the cabin all shook up and bloody, believes that Ash killed her parents-- but she's mistaken.\n\t\"Evil Dead 2\" puts shame to all of the low-budget horror flicks that plagued the 1980s.  With only three million, Raimi manages to use his restraints in the most endearing of ways, even if it's obvious stop-motion special effects, or loopy camera tricks that are simple yet effective.  Whether it be spooky fog floating through the forest or wind that sounds like it came out of a Scooby Doo episode, \"Evil Dead 2\" still manages to be scary.\n\tOddly enough, with all the blood, gore, and the monstrous faces of the crazed Deadites, there is plenty of room for slapstick comedy.  One would expect it to have the dark humor of a \"Scream\" movie, but on the contrary, Raimi sets certain scenes that are truly meant to be funny.  The one that truly sticks out is when poor Ash, covered with grime and scared to death, discovered his hand has been possessed.  You can only imagine how he reacts.\n\tAs you watch the film though, don't expect any of the brilliance of \"Psycho,\" because that's in a whole different league.  The acting is mediocre (except for the wonderful Campbell ... and you can't forget Berry's harmonious scream), the one-liners are cheesy, and the film would rather be silly than serious.  But nevertheless, \"Evil Dead 2\" is so much fun that it deserves repeated viewings.  This is one of the few cult films where I can truly see why its followers are so supportive.",

Also coming toward the cabin is the girl who's father made the tape recording.  This movie was not as good as the first but there are some good scares especially when they jump out at you. It's also pretty funny at times too.

Things really start to pick up here, there's even a scene where we have the camera moving through the cabin of what we assume is a point of view shot because we never actually see what it is that is moving through the cabin chasing Ash. Again Bruce Campbell returns playing the role of Ash and what we can assume completely ignores the very first Evil Dead and starts completely over from the side of Ash in a completely different approach where as it is just him and his girlfriend going up to a cabin. Instead of a bunch of killer people, it centers more on Ash and his transition from creature to human, it goes more along the lines of inner turmoil and personal struggle as Ash tries to hang on to his sanity. There are a few scenes where he absolutely loses it and even we start to wonder what is really happening or is it all in his head. His character even alternates between good and evil so we are never exactly sure what could possibly happen next. Its a fine mix of comedy and horror in this film, but towards the end of the movie Ash goes completely bad ass and gains a chainsaw for a hand in what may be one of the most epic things ever, a chainsaw for a hand and a sawed off shotgun. Its a very fine mix of horror, action, and comedy that is definitely worth the watch. I definitely recommend this one to any horror fan, great sequel indeed.",
