    "summary": "Two angels, Damiel (Bruno Ganz) and Cassiel (Otto Sander), glide through the streets of Berlin, observing the bustling population, providing invisible rays of hope to the distressed but never interacting with them. When Damiel falls in love with lonely trapeze artist Marion (Solveig Dommartin), the angel longs to experience life in the physical world, and finds--with some words of wisdom from actor Peter Falk (playing himself) -- that it might be possible for him to take human form.",

When he begins to develop feelings for Marion (Solveig Dommartin), a trapeze artist in the circus, he considers relinquishing his wings in order to live life like a human.  Beyond touching on matters of the human heart, Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire is also a beautifully made film featuring some of the most creative and stunning cinematography imaginable, the camera swooping and maneuvering in such a way as to imitate the perspective of an angel.  You don't have to believe in the existence of angels to appreciate Wings of Desire – you just have to believe in great cinema.",

            "content": "I wanted to see this after hearing one of my favourite films as a teenager, the 90s film City of Angels, was based on it. I'd never got around to seeing it until now. I have to say, there are similarities and also differences but overall I loved this film. It is quite an arty type film, its mostly in black and white (although there are brief moments in colour) which gives it a timeless and even somehow an ethereal feel, but that didn't bother me. Its a very thoughtful film - quite a deep and meaningful film and it somewhat (dialogue wise) talks in riddles but as I say I very much enjoyed it. Perhaps it'd be more accurate to say the dialogue is a bit poetic, rather than entirely consisting of riddles. It isn't a film likely to appeal to people just wanting to sit back and not have to go to any effort to try to follow and understand everything, I suppose.\n\nI like the concept of angels being around, able to hear the internal thoughts of humans who have no idea of their existence and part of their purpose being to help people in their final moments. It may sound a bit grim, it is undoubtedly grim in parts but its the sort of optimism that the plot hints at, that I suppose I find so comforting and that appeals to me. I am quite a socially anxious person, in terms of face to face conversations and interactions and so there's something very uplifting and comforting in the concept of angels and aspects or themes covered in this film, so its safe to say that this film appeals to me a great deal.\n\nThe film is primarily in German, although there is some English but for those unfamiliar with the German language, there are (of course) English subtitles. This may put people off watching but it certainly didn't put me off and as I say both languages feature, although I'd say primarily German is spoken, moreso than English. \n\nI felt that the plot pace in this film was a fair bit slower than the plot pace in the 90s remake, City of Angels, although thats not necessarily a bad thing. Of course its up to you whether a slow plot pace especially bothers you or not, depending on how patient (or not) you are as a film viewer. I felt that the not especially clear plot direction made me consider for longer how different people felt, what they worried and wondered while the camera pans from person to person, with the English subtitles telling us their thoughts and concerns. This includes who I presume to be Nazi soldiers - this may cause issues with anyone who has been personally affected by the war, of course, so I suppose I felt I should mention this. There is also specific mentions of Jews as well. Thematically speaking it mostly concentrates on loneliness and isolation, I'd say (I did say its (if but partly) grim).\n\nI would wholeheartedly recommend this film to anyone interested in it, although I say that while also wanting to make it clear that I realise some people won't necessarily enjoy it, for the language issue, the lack of clear and fast paced plot direction and perhaps the war and/or religious aspects/connotations. If those things don't bother you, then please see this - its well worth a watch!.",

            "content": "A moving and thoughtful contemplation on the wonders and tragedies of life.\n\nDirector Wim Wenders' German romantic fantasy drama Wings of Desire (1987) is a fascinating arthouse picture. I've never seen anything quite like it, honestly. Wenders imagines what it would be like for angels to observe Berlin in a somber toned, moody atmosphere, with dreamlike camerawork. Wenders' direction haunts his city as we get post World War II sentiments of despair, hopelessness, and uncertainty from Berliners. I love how Wings of Desire feels depressing, yet also hopeful for how people can still appreciate life. Wenders takes Berlin right before The Berlin Wall falls and shows us his destroyed city rebuilding homes and lives from scratch. Wenders' innovative direction and heartfelt feelings make Wings of Desire enthralling to watch no matter how strange and even romantic in how optimistic and loving it can feel.\n\nCinematographer Henri Alekan pulls off a magic trick of breathtaking black and white shots with careful framing of Berlin in wide shots and slow moving panning shots to display all of Berlin. Wings of Desire has stunning close-up shots of faces framed in the center of the screen for a haunting effect. You can feel the stare of the angels. The black and white scenes are incredible to look at whether it's ruined Berlin streets or hazy Berlin clubs. The shadows, silhouettes, and reflective shots that linger on angels feeling empathy are simply magnificent. Wings of Desire is one of the best looking films I've ever seen.\n\nWriters Wim Wenders and Peter Handke's writing is sublime. Philosophical musings about life's meaning from hopeful love to devastating self doubt. Wings of Desire has it all. There's thoughtful questions, tender romance, even the odd blunt joke. The angels observing humanity and one finding a lust for life, while the other is emotionally hurt by our suffering is touching. I love how creative and original Wings of Desire remains decades after its release.\n\nEditor Peter Przygodda will cut so neatly from person to person as the angels narrate about hearing the thoughts and feelings of others. The faded wings on the rooftops to sharp transitions from wide to close-up are all striking. Every scene has creative cuts. 128 minutes feels its long length, but I was absorbed by it all regardless of Wings of Desire's slow burn pace.\n\nBruno Ganz is fabulous as an empathetic angel named Damiel. His love of a Solveig Dommartin's entrancing French trapeze artist Marion is endearing as is his worship of her form and grace. Her performance is astounding with impressive acrobatics, tender expressions of love, and a forlorn homesickness for France, yet a hopeful wonder of what Germany will bring. Ganz is intriguing to watch as Damiel hears, understands, then experiences humanity. \n\nOtto Sander is moving as solemn angel Cassiel, who only hears and sees the worst and saddest humanity has to offer. He's reflective and caring with incredible acting during the suicide witnessing and patient listening of Curt Bois' likable ruminating old author. Peter Falk is hilarious and charming as an angelic version of himself. Peter Falk is naturally funny, completely captivating, and inspiring as he brings a life to his every word. Hans Martin Stier is devastating as the motorist who is dying and regretting his life until Damiel gives him hope and peace. Nick Cave is intense and hypnotizing as he actually performs as Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds for a haunting underground German concert. You can see the emos, Goths, and punks all digging Cave's frenetic style, poetic lyrics, and eclectic gothic rock with a punk edge.\n\nHeidi Lüdi's production design creates a neat wrecked WWII movie set with depth and layers. The tiny carnival, eerie rock club, and quaint little German locales are mesmerizing. Her art direction is incomparable with the angels hanging out like gargoyles above Berlin with angel art statues in gold above the clouds. Markus Pluta and Alexander Korn's set decoration has leftovers from an older Germany to new Nick Cave posters and graffiti to antique furniture. Everything is there for a reason. \n\nComposer Jürgen Knieper brings experimental Gothic rock to epic symphonic orchestrations for a fascinating use of music. Hearing Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds as well as the first German group is quite a fun timepiece for that era of Berlin's rock sonic landscape. Sound designers Jean-Paul Mugel, Axel Arft, and Hartmut Eichgrün fade in voices for the angels to hear and change voices into echoes or screams suddenly. Every sound choice is interesting.\n\nMonika Jacobs' costumes are gorgeous from the gilded trapeze outfits to the all black trench coats and scarves for the angels. Regina Huyer's make-up gives the ladies a natural glow and haunting expressions. The angels all having slicked back hair in a tight little ponytail is a neat detail. Especially once Damiel is human, his hair is long and let loose with his newfound freedom.\n\nIn conclusion, Wings of Desire is a completely enthralling experience unlike any film I have ever seen.",

            "content": "In Wim Wenders 1987 romantic, drama, fantasy film Wings of Desire was originally known as Del Himmel über Berlin (The heavens over Berlin). Cinematography was by Henri Alekan, he shot this film with both color and a black and white tone. This film in particular took place in Berlin during WII, which is about two immortal angels that travel throughout the city of Berlin listening to the thoughts of distressed people on the streets. The sounds of high pitch, choirs, and violins provide a  relaxing environment. Two angels known as Damiel (Bruno Ganz) and Cassiel (Otto Sander). Provide hope and give comfort to those who are weak and feel alone. Even though they were unable to be seen; the angels show commiseration for troubled people, so they can feel a heart warming presence to help them reconsider on their life choices. The black and white tone represents how the world is seen by angels. This movie jumps to different scenes from when Damiel and Cassiel explore the city of Berlin providing sympathy. The angels roam around Berlin are usually dressed in long coats with scarves tucked in. The main angel Damiel decides that he wants to become human due to the fact of him falling in love with the trapeze artist Marion (Solveig Dommartin). He wanted to become mortal so he talks with Cassiel about how it would feel to have senses or to be able to feed a cat. Damiel has gained knowledge that no angel is capable of accomplishing. This movie was not that good and didn't have me on the edge of my seat, urging to see what's going to happen. This film could have been great if it wasn't so dreadful, I give this movie three stars due to the fact of it being colorless and tiring. Although this movie gives great life points I'm neutral.",

Unlike most films where a plot is explained and handed to you, \"Wings of Desire\" does not outright tell you what is happening. We discover the plot of the film through dialogue and visual cues. The main story follows Damiel an angel who watches over the people of Berlin, Germany. Through playful camera work, that consists of hard cuts and sweeping tracking shots that switch depending who is on the screen, the movie takes us throughout the city as the angel listens to the thoughts of people. These internal monologues offer beautiful scenes where we see characters raw emotions while listening to their inner thoughts. The visual imagery ranges from angel wings, to color changes, and wardrobe design. The color of the movie switches from black and white to color. This gives us the visual representation on how the angels and humans perceive the world. In the opening shot we are greeted by Damiel perched on a roof and his wings are present for a second allowing us to see he is an angel. The costume design for the movie chose to portray the angels sporting trench coats with pony tails. Having them stand out for us to understand that they are different from the rest of the world. These are just a few examples of how the movie uses tools to carry the movie. This creativity makes this more of an experience that allow the viewers to come up with the answers and gives incentive to watch the movie more than once.",

            "content": "Wings of Desire is a perfectly mediocre film. This movie is particular in its audience in that those who enjoy sophistication and deep thinking will very much enjoy it. However those who enjoy action and adrenaline boosting adventure, this film is not for you. Profound thought is involved because the angles in \"Wings of Desire\" are an enigma, they are depicted as pony tailed men with long trench coats and are not perfected as a stereotypical angel. Damiel specifically comes to conclusions that being human is better than being an angel, which is puzzling. He falls in love with a woman named Marion who is a trapeze artist. He is so mesmerized by her abilities that make her vulnerable and angel like that he wants to experience love. His interests to be a human are made evident at the beginning of the film when he is seated in a car with Cassiel. He explains how he wants to feel the wind and wants to be greeted, he is tired of  hovering above people and living for eternity. Problems arise because there is no plot to the movie and often confusing on how and why certain events take place. Examples can be shown when they randomly switch to long segments of the angels hearing thought with no real correlation behind it. Almost as to fill in time for the movie. It also seems odd and peculiar of the angel being a perfect match for the trapeze artist, seemingly much older and with the way he approaches her at the bar it wouldn't seem practical for them to have such a strong bond. The dialogue in the film also has an uneasy presence due to it only being the angels to interact in the beginning and the cliche lines that are filtered through. For example at the end of the film the trapeze artist seems to have a whole fabricated line explaining her \"lonely\" situation; however, in the beginning of the film dialogue was very scarce, also her expression on wanting to be loved can be seen as cliche. The audience is also expecting more of an adventure and spectacle to the piece where Damiel becomes human. He stresses his desire to be a human and feel what a human feels; even though, we are shown bits of him enjoying mortality we don't sense the full aura of him feeling pain, suffering, or other spectrums of the human condition. It is understood that he has studied humanity since the beginning of time and can somewhat understand what it is like, but it isn't made clear if he truly is immersed in society. Since I enjoy movies that deal with thought as well as an action packed adventure I would rate this movie as a 5/10.",

Berlin, Germany is blanketed with angels who can only see in dull colors of black and white. Their job is to provide indirect comfort to those who may be in need of a little extra love and care. Damiel (Bruno Ganz) and Cassiel (Otto Sander) sweep the city and observe how humans interact and form relations with one another all while providing their best wishes. The film begins with a very sporadic string of events. The first 20 minutes will be spent trying to figure out what the movie is about and what it will entail.

Patience and close attention is recommended throughout the entirety of the movie. You may find yourself dozing off, but be careful because you may miss an important detail amongst things that do not matter. The movie is made up of interpretations and wonder.

It gets very confusing, not knowing where the plot is, and the point of it only shows later on in the movie. The sound of violins and other string instruments gives off a comforting tone.

            "content": "What comes to mind when you think of an angel? I am sure it is not two grown men visible by children, walking around town. In the movie Wings of Desire, this is exactly how they are portrayed. This movie produced by Wim Wenders is unrealistic in more ways than one.\nRight off the bat, the movie was very difficult to understand. For the majority of the movie there was not much conversation, it was more of the characters thoughts being narrated. Without much dialogue between characters it was not a very interesting plot. The plot seemed to be very faint or as there was no plot at all. About half way through the movie a plot began to arise. I feel as if the conflict was introduced in the beginning of the movie, Another mistake the producer, Wim Wenders, made is not being clear on who exactly could see the angels and who could not. For example, it is said that only children can see these angels and adults can not. In one scene Damiel was at a coffee shop and a man, Peter, claimed he knew he was there and could feel his presence. Up until this point viewers had been persuaded to believe only children could see these angels, but when Peter claimed he felt Damiel's presence it was very confusing. Although the movie was jubbled in most scenes, It took some time working up to the plot and a few scenes either could have been deleted or shortened. For example,  Marion, the trapeze artist, was doing trapeze for a long time.

Damiel is a majestic angel that is one of the main characters of the movie. He is first seen looking over the city of  Berlin in a black trench coat with a mullet. First seeing him with wings coming out of his back is shocking because angels portrayed in movies do not usual look like this. Damiel is looking down at this girl who is looking right back at him. No one else sees this angel besides this little girl in the street. It tells you something at the beginning of the movie of how a young kid can only see the angel. In the airplane where Damiel is walking a kid looks him in his face and he stops then smiles at her. Children are cute and innocent human beings so that can be why kids can be the only ones to see the angels.",

            "content": "A movie that was confusing, different (in a good way), and pretty well played. All of these topics come to mind when thinking about the film \"Wings of Desire\" directed by Wim Wenders in 1997. This film was a unique fantasy drama that had a very interesting feel to it. Throughout this movie, Damiel and Cassiel had to be pretty quiet and emotionless as angels. People couldn't see them because they were angels. They would be in the skies of the city of Berlin watching over the great people in the city. The people's feelings and thoughts would draw the angels closer. The angels would try helping the hopeless people by making them feel like they weren't alone, which was actually true. The different colors of the backgrounds in this movie truly could confuse anyone. After figuring it out, the reason behind it was pretty interesting. The angels perspective created a black and white color background. The color switched to normal colors once the movie was in perspective of real life. There wasn't much of a plot in this movie, which made it interesting. The angels would just go from person to person which made it a little random from time to time, but it wasn't overwhelming. This movie was always keeping my attention. It might not be the go-to action movie, but it's definitely an interesting and well played out movie. The ending with Damiel deciding to take a dip into a real perspective going out of his angel self was a big turning point. Seeing Damiel after that just made you into it and made you wonder. Some of the scenes drug on for a longer time than they needed. Some scenes were just way too long that didn't need to be like that at all.",

Either the medication or the movie will do a decent job of knocking you out within a half hour. I'm not sure black and white vision of the angels is the problem or the lack of action. It is most likely the lack of coherent plot and uncomfortable dialogue. The movie begins with children watching an angel on top of a building. One is on the back of its mother's bicycle and the other is walking across the street. There is no issue with this scene despite the fact that the children are never seen again and the angel standing on the edge of the building more resembles a gargoyle than a heavenly being. The camera panning all over the city and taking in the inner monologues of the depressed people in the apartment and on the subway will make you dizzy. The whole movie is a dizzy mess. The scenes seem randomly spliced together and incohesive. One minute, you are listening to a man, whose name we don't even learn until the credits, talk about his experience as a holocaust survivor and suddenly you are watching a circus. The worst part is probably the inner monologues. There isn't an ounce of positivity which seems entirely unrealistic. The only inner monologue that makes any sense and creates any sort of sympathy is the suicide case. The spoken and unspoken monologues of the trapeze artist, Marion (Solveig Dommartin), are the most overrated-under developed of them all. They are long-winded and incredibly drawn out and unless you are really paying attention to what she is saying, you'll miss it. It sounds more like what a teenage girl would write in her diary than spoken in a major motion picture. The only coherent thought that comes across is the feeling of terror she has before doing her final trapeze act. Speaking of that trapeze act, it was a small moment of my life I'll never get back. The act becomes tedious as she carefully swings back and forth above the ring while striking poses showcasing her strength and flexibility. It's not that the act is bad, just long too long. You can only see a woman do so much swinging before you lose interest. The scene at the end of the movie where Damiel (Bruno Ganz) hands her a glass and she takes a sip is so incredibly unrealistic that you'll want to end the movie early.  \n\nWould I give this movie a \"two thumbs up\" like Roger Ebert? Absolutely not. Two thumbs down. My problem is not with the actors. They tried their best. My problem is in what seems like a serious lack of scene planning on the director's part.",

            "content": "The 1987 drama Wings of Desire shows the beauty in everyday occurrences and the boundaries that occur in the world around us. The movie follows two angels, Damiel (Bruno Ganz) and Cassiel (Otto Sander) and their day-to-day lives of observing and listening to the people of Berlin's thoughts. At first, this seems confusing and the scenes seem never-ending. However, we witness the angels attempting to comfort those with oppressive thoughts and gloomy spirits. Sometimes the angels are able to change peoples' point of views, but one scene shows Damiel comforting a man whose ready to jump off a bridge, and the man succeeds. The movie shows how wonderful simple pleasures are such as hot coffee on a cold day and merely rubbing your hands together to create a small amount of heat. People today have ceased to forget how important these minor things are to everyday life. In the movie, the angels do not experience the luxury of emotions or feelings, and some wish that they could. Throughout the movie, the screen seems to dwell on scenes that seem unnecessary to the point of the plot. The film's first half is spent following an overwhelming amount of people's thoughts and pointless activities.  This saying, so many different people are shown that it is hard to differentiate who we should really be paying attention to. Two civilians that become important to the story line are Marion, played by Solveig Dommartin, and Peter Falk, played by himself. Throughout the movie, we witness that Marion is lonely and that almost everything she thinks or says has a form of symbolism. Watching for the first time, the viewer may have a hard time following Marion's thinking and what she is saying. Solveig Dommartin struggles to show and match the emotions that her character is feeling and speaking about. This makes her acting overall hard to follow. The movie as a whole needs to be watched more than once to fully understand what is going on and to truly appreciate the effort that goes in to each and every detail and line spoken. This movie forces the viewer to constantly be thinking and even can make you question things yourself. I would not recommend this film to someone who does not want to spend two hours in deep thought. Overall, Wings of Desire is extremely well thought out and well written even though some points of the film can be hard to understand. This movie demonstrates and portrays an accurate representation of what Berlin and its people were like during the cold war. However, because this was a depressing time, the movie itself has a predominantly eerie and depressing tone to it.",

Played by Solveig Dommartin, she is lackluster at best.  One of the most iconic scenes is when she sits in front of her mirror and rants about how she cannot continue her trapeze routine on the night of the full moon.  Her facial expression does not change, and her monotone voice lulls the viewer to sleep.  All in all, this movie is not only one of the most boring movies I have ever watched, but it is also a type of movie that only a select few will enjoy.

The camera is focused on her for an inordinate amount of time flailing her arms in the air in the most awkward ways and overexaggerated swaying to the nonsense music playing in the background. Meanwhile the rest of the concertgoers are nodding their heads and swaying like civilized human beings making Marion stick out even more. All of these aspects came together to create a scene so terrible it physically pained me to watch.\n     Wings of Desire is a scrapbook movie pieced together with extremely long uninteresting scenes and attempted introspective dialogue creating a film so dull it takes master self-control not to succumb to the urge to turn off the movie altogether.",

For every great scene, there are several awful scenes to drag this movie down. At multiple points through this film, I become invested in the story and am curious as to where it goes, but it always leads me astray. Damiel has a shift in the movie which made me very excited to see what he would do with his new powers. Less than 15 minutes later, we are met with one of several painfully long scenes. This film continues to fall on its face because it reverts to these terrible scenes. The scenes are drawn out with no point and it makes me wonder why they are even in the movie. Wim Wenders was sent two scenes at a time by Peter Handke and it feels like Wenders literally just glued all of these scenes together. Nothing carries over to another scene and everything feels like it's on its own island. With some redeeming qualities, \"Wings of Desire\" cannot make up for its horrible flow and boring scenes.",

It almost seems like the director took a half-hour show and stretched it out over the course of two hours by adding in useless filler. It's the equivalent of telling a fifth grader to write five pages about their dog. Eventually, it will get repetitive and boring because they are running out of ideas and trying to reword things differently just to get the word count.

            "content": "In Wim Wenders 1987 romantic, drama, fantasy film Wings of Desire was originally known as Del Himmel über Berlin (The heavens over Berlin). Cinematography was by Henri Alekan, he shot this film with both color and a black and white tone. This film in particular took place in Berlin during WII, which is about two immortal angels that travel throughout the city of Berlin listening to the thoughts of distressed people on the streets. The sounds of high pitch, choirs, and violins provide a  relaxing environment. Two angels known as Damiel (Bruno Ganz) and Cassiel (Otto Sander). Provide hope and give comfort to those who are weak and feel alone. Even though they were unable to be seen; the angels show commiseration for troubled people, so they can feel a heart warming presence to help them reconsider on their life choices.\nThe Beginning starts off with Damiel standing on top of a high building staring down. The black and white tone represents how the world is seen by angels. This movie jumps to different scenes from when Damiel and Cassiel explore the city of Berlin providing sympathy. They helped the guy on the subway train, the holocaust victim, and even the prostitute. In each scenario, one or the other would examine the thoughts of people and try to help them make a better decision and let them know they're not alone by attempting to comfort them. As Damiel wanders into the circus, he glances at the trapeze artist who is thinking about the full moon. Falling into the trap of superstitions she becomes afraid that she will fall and hurt herself. She becomes upset that the circus is going out of business which would leave her unemployed, which leaves her no choice but to find another job. This made him want to become human even more.\nAlthough Cassiel put a hand on the guys shoulder to hopefully change his thoughts and actions, he didn't want to think anymore. Eventually he jumped off the building and committed suicide. The angels roam around Berlin are usually dressed in long coats with scarves tucked in. The main angel Damiel decides that he wants to become human due to the fact of him falling in love with the trapeze artist Marion (Solveig Dommartin). He wanted to become mortal so he talks with Cassiel about how it would feel to have senses or to be able to feed a cat. In this specific scene, he wakes up bleeding from his armor striking him in the head, the kids that was hanging out nearby thought Damiel was just a drunk that needed food. Only children can see angels because of their innocence.\nIn order to become human Damiel would have to take off his armor, intentionally that's what he did. When Damiel and Peter Falk spoke at the fence, Peter tells him that he was an angel. Peter could tell Damiel was an angel because he once was an angel as well. During this scene, Peter Falk was getting ready for a Nazi movie in Germany when Damiel said \"I sold something.\" Peter responds saying, \" The armor, what did you get for it?\" Damiel had replied he sold his armor for 200 marks and Peter had told him he got ripped off because when he became mortal he sold his armor for 500 dollars at the pawn shop. That's when Damiel realizes that Peter was once an angel too. Peter had told him that,\"There's a lot of us. Your not the only one!\" \nDamiel has gained knowledge that no angel is capable of accomplishing. For the hit movie Wings of Desire, Wenders was awarded for best director at both the European Film Awards and Cannes Film Festival. However, this movie takes too long to understand the actual meaning. It gives off a boring vibe and makes you want to fall asleep or turn it off and watch something more exciting. Although Wenders made some very important points in this movie based on life and love, it wasn't interesting at all. Wings of Desire jumps around a lot and if you don't pay attention then you will not get the concept of this movie. In most romantic movies they get straight to the point but this one in particular is not your typical romantic movie. It's very rare when two people see each other and automatically fall in love like Damiel and Marion. This movie was not that good and didn't have me on the edge of my seat, urging to see what's going to happen. This film could have been great if it wasn't so dreadful, I give this movie three thumbs up due to the fact of it being colorless and tiring.",

It is directed by Wim Wenders and stars Bruno Ganz as Damiel, Solveig Dommartin as Marion, Otto Sanders as Cassiel, and Peter Falk as himself. The plot outlines the lives of two angels Damiel (Bruno Ganz) and Cassiel (Otto Sanders) who stay around the city of Berlin and have never experienced what it is like to be human. The job of the angels is to comfort humans during difficult times and to witness and observe events that involve humans. The angel Damiel observes and falls in love with a circus performer named Marion (Solveig Dommartin) who is traveling through Berlin with the Circus Alekan. After observing Marion, the angel Damiel began to contemplate transforming from an angel to a human.\n        Overall the movie Wings of Desire is difficult to understand due to the techniques used throughout the film which fail to add any significance. The narration is composed of people's thoughts transformed into words. In the movie the people rarely speak actual words, instead the majority of the dialog is their thoughts. This method of narration reveals the character's thoughts immediately, with this technique it makes it easier for the viewer to understand the character's feelings and emotions since they are given directly through dialog. The characters for the most part speak German and the audio is mostly in German. This makes the movie difficult to understand by someone who is not fluent in German because they have to read the subtitles and subsequently focus less on the movie's picture and what the characters are actually doing. In addition, the film mixed black and white with color and the background music in some scenes fails to match the tone and mood of the scene because it is not the genre the viewer expects it to be. The movie exhibited poor organization of scenes and included multiple random scenes that show different aspects of the film but lack logical order. This method of revealing plot points creates frustration because the viewer sees multiple scenes that are unrelated and tries to connect them even though they might only be loosely related to the plot. The angels in the film do not look or act like stereotypical angels. Instead the main two angels are portrayed as middle-aged adults who wear dark colored trench coats, have long hair and act human. This portrayal makes it more difficult for viewers to pick up on the fact that they are angels because it takes the plot a considerable amount of time to give enough hints that they are angels.",

            "content": "\"Wings of Desire\" can be compared to a long road trip spent sitting in a car while a child repeatedly asks their parents \"are we there yet?\" It is a movie that has no direct plot line and full of evident symbols that are up for the viewers interpretation. The film \"Wings of Desire\" directed by Wim Wenders was released in 1987. Throughout the movie the audience gets to look into the eyes and listen into the ears of angels who unknowingly are present everyday roaming through the streets of our lives. Set in 1980 West Berlin, angels Damiel played by Bruno Ganz and Cassiel played by Otto Sander wander through the streets peering into the minds of passing strangers. This movie's storyline had very high potential at being interesting and entertaining but overall it was a let down. \nFor the first hour and a half of the movie there is no direct plot line. The audience is constantly engulfed into following around Damiel and we get hints of random thoughts that the people of Berlin are having. Through the entirety of the film the question 'why is this happening' is never answered. The inner thoughts of random people present various different issues, all of which have no correlation to each other or the plot. Their role has no significance to the movie, other than to simply relay the message that angels can hear what people are thinking. Some examples are when Cassiel puts his hand on a suicidal man's shoulder, another is a Damiel holding a man's head questioning his relationship.  The first half of the movie simply does not have an underlying meaning. There is no clear answer to why Wenders filmed an hour and a half of thoughts that do not aline, there is only assumption.\nIn order to understand the slightest bit of what is happening in this movie you need informational tips about what to expect. One of which is, do not search for meaning in everything you see or hear. There are a lot of things in this movie that do not play into the plot at all. For example, do not search for meaning in the thoughts of the random people. They have no correlation to each other and it was emphasized a ridiculous amount with no purpose. By knowing this, it creates a certain mindset for the audience that allows them to sit back and let the information be placed in front of them instead of searching for all of it. Also, the audience has to find the plot to this movie. From the usual blockbuster movies we see, you are used to the plot being given to you, with a clear and evident storyline. The plot of Wings of Desire however is to be searched for and will not be found until the second half of the movie.\n The movie is incredibly unique and is something that would be very difficult to replicate. But, for a movie that strived to be unique and original, it fell into the cliche ending of a happily ever after when Bruno Ganz transitions from an angel to a human. Also steering away from the original goal, the plot revolves around the love story between Damiel and Marion (a trapeze artist) falling into the movie cliche of a romance. So, the movie did not quite achieve its goal, but capturing these \"cliches\" in the film overall made it a more enjoyable watch and made you stay until the very end because they are what created the plot. \nThe cinematography of this movie was beautifully shot. The elongated scenes with continuous camera movement going from room to room made it seem like you were in the movie itself, walking around and turning your head. The library scene in fact is the most interesting use of cinematography within the entire movie. The library serves as a community gathering for the angels. In this scene you can see them peering over people's shoulders, looking at the books, and  placing a hand on their shoulders. They would peer into the camera lens (which felt like they were looking into your soul) with a solemn look on their face. Intense choir music powered over the visuals of the scene and made so much emotion come through to the audience; It sent chills down your spine. Being such a quiet movie, the music plays a major role. The emotions felt throughout this movie are because of the music. The composers of \"Wings of Desire\" were Jurgen Knieper and Laurent Petitgand. \nOverall this movie is a 5 out of 10, the main factor in this is because nearly 50% of the movie does no service to the plot at all. You have to search for the meaning and the message of everything in the movie which is not appealing to a movie viewer who just literally wants to \"sit back and enjoy the show\".  It is quite a mind-boggling journey throughout it all but when the plot is finally introduced the enjoyment of the movie does sky rocket. When the plot begins it becomes more personal and you begin to understand the movie. Although the plot is rewarding this movie is not recommended to those who do not want to search for the meaning and who are impatient viewers.",

In the movie Wings of Desire, this is exactly how they are portrayed. This movie produced by Wim Wenders is unrealistic in more ways than one. I would rate this movie a five out of ten due to its fictional attributes. \nRight off the bat, the movie was very difficult to understand. For the majority of the movie there was not much conversation, it was more of the characters thoughts being narrated. Without much dialogue between characters it was not a very interesting plot. The plot seemed to be very faint or as there was no plot at all. About half way through the movie a plot began to arise. Damiel (Bruno Ganz), one of the angels, began to fall for a trapeze artist. Because the trapeze artist was an adult, she could not see Damiel which brought about conflict. I feel as if the conflict was introduced in the beginning of the movie, it would have hooked more viewers and created a better film. Another mistake the producer, Wim Wenders, made is not being clear on who exactly could see the angels and who could not. For example, it is said that only children can see these angels and adults can not. In one scene Damiel was at a coffee shop and a man, Peter, claimed he knew he was there and could feel his presence. Up until this point viewers had been persuaded to believe only children could see these angels, but when Peter claimed he felt Damiel's presence it was very confusing. Later to find out Peter was once an angel himself. In order to make these scenes not so confusing the producer should have introduced the fact that peter was once an angel. Although the movie was jubbled in most scenes, once the plot was finally introduced it was a very good plot. It took some time working up to the plot and a few scenes either could have been deleted or shortened. For example,  Marion, the trapeze artist, was doing trapeze for a long time. It was a waste of time and kind of awkward for some viewers because it was irrelevant. The plot was about the issue of two people being in love but Marion is not able to see Damiel. Another good part of the movie was the ending, although it was drug out and the scenes could have been shortened it helped wrap the movie up.   \nWings of Desire which was also called Der Himmel über Berlin. Meaning the sky over berlin in german.  Wim Wenders, the producer, released the movie on May 17 of 1987. Wenders also produced movies such as Lisbon Story, The Salt of the Earth, and The Million Dollar Hotel. Wenders was awarded a few awards for his movie Wings of Desire. These awards include \"Cannes Best Director Award\", \"European Film Award For Best Director\", and \"Independent Spirit Award for Best International Film\". \nOverall, the movie Wings of Desire has a decent plot. The plot and the ending seem to only be the positives of this film. Although the plot is good, it was not introduced until mid-film. Some other grey areas include the set-up of the movie and dialogue. This movie could have been improved in many areas to make it outstanding. In my opinion I would rate this movie a five out of ten and would not recommend this movie to others. \n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000694/awards",

            "content": "\"Wings of Desire\" (1987) by Wim Wenders is what you get when you realize that art doesn't come with a recipe or instruction manual. It breaks so many rules of storytelling that if you tried to fill out a checklist of all of the features of a good story, you'd give up halfway through. Even so, this movie just works. Wim Wenders decided to make a film that thinks for itself, not bothering to follow some silly \"conventions.\" It asks questions that it doesn't help you answer, forcing you to take it all in and think about what you are seeing. In \"Wings of Desire\" there is no direct exposition, it gives you the questions and shows the world upon which you should base your answer. This film makes you think about the path from question to answer on your own, no hand-holding.\n The first two characters that we meet are angels: Cassiel and Damiel, played by Otto Sander and Bruno Gantz. We can often find these two walking and talking together, comparing the thoughts and events that they heard and saw that day. We follow him throughout the movie, taking his point of view as he goes about his celestial business.\nThe gimmick of this film is actually quite interesting: the angels can hear people's thoughts as if they were speaking, and can even interpret the signals of a radio tower. We hear the voices in the heads of normal people, but we don't ever hear the inner thoughts of the angels, specifically the thoughts of Damiel. That is our job, we are the angels of the angels. The only way they can interact with the real world is by comforting people in distress, be that considering suicide or dying of injuries or recalling awful memories of the past. Why do they do any of this? Maybe you can figure it out, but you won't get much help from the movie other than what is shown to  you. The cinematography, done by the legendary Henri Alekan, is part of what makes this movie great. The camera moves through the scene as if unbound by gravity or the harsh motions of real world physics. When the camera is in black and white, which represents the viewpoint of the angels, the tone is neutral, you don't feel anything, just see it. Situations that might normally be suspenseful seem almost meaningless. It is when the film sparks into color that the film conveys a tone. \nThat feeling is what art should be judged by: how much a piece makes you think and feel is what gives it quality. This film is equivalent to a two hour trip to an art museum. There is no-one there who can tell you the exact meaning that the artist intended for the piece, no hand-holding, just you and the art. You have to connect what you see and what the characters say to figure out the subtle symbolisms. Just as you would explore a museum, \"Wings of Desire\" lets you take the story at your own pace, with the long, wordless scenes giving you time to reflect on what you are seeing. \nThe third important character to this story is Marion (Solveig Dommartin) a trapeze artist for a travelling circus. Marion is the weakest part of this film: her only role is to tempt Damiel to \"take the plunge\" into the real world of hate, pain, time, and death; and what or who tempts him ends up being inconsequential. The last half hour of the film seems like it wasn't really well refined, with character interactions that seem out of place and the ending monologue that doesn't do much more than finding out how long it takes to say \"and they lived happily ever after.\" \n\"Wings of Desire\" is the perfect movie for the thinker. Heavy on visuals, light on words, the film lets your mind wander to wherever it pleases. It asks some questions about life, but it doesn't expect you to answer them, especially since it doesn't give you any clues to help you. The calm, soothing german voices do not intrude on your english thoughts, allowing you to read the subtitles at your own pace. You don't even need to think about the movie, which you can use to clear your mind for two hours. Overall, \"Wings of Desire\" is a solid eight out of ten. If you like long visits to the local art museum, this movie is for you. If you don't like films with at least one fight scene or a twist at the end, this is definitely not for you. Wim Wenders gives you everything outright, nothing is hidden to be revealed at the end, just a bunch of subtle symbolism.",

            "content": "Wim Wenders directs the romantic drama that takes place in Berlin in the Cold War era, Wings of Desire (1988). The slow plot follows two men who are angels that walk around the city listening to the troubling thoughts of the citizens. Angels, Damiel (Bruno Ganz) and Cassiel (Otto Sander) listen to many people think about the old days and how life could be better. This movie strictly targets the audience that is willing to think through the movie. The audience must be patience while the slow plot develops into a romance when Damiel falls in love with the trapeze artist of the closing circus Marion (Solveig Dommartin). Damiel decides to be human to witness and enjoy the small things in life like coffee and blood. Wenders uses Damiel to show human emotions, being able to have love and sacrifice. The acting is not over done, it is very simple as well as the costumes. The angels are dressed in trench coats, like normal citizens, showing the hope is everywhere. The only part of the film that creates confusion for the audience, is the rambling of the dialogue. Although Wenders does a very good job on changes the image of angels and creates a plot that leaves the audience deep in thought. The audience is left with questions never been offered before.",

            "content": "Wings of Desire was an awful movie with a great theme. Through angels looking over humans this movie sent a message about how humans take the small things in life for granted. I thought this was a great message to give, but the delivery of it did not win me over. This movie had very little dialogue in the beginning which was really different than most other films. The talking came from a narrator with a monotone voice making it almost impossible to keep your eyes open. Along with the voices acting as a lullaby, this film had no structure. It took a while for the movie to start following a true plot. Throughout the movie you are focusing on all these little details with the assumption they will come back later and be of importance, but they never do. There were scenes that had nothing to do with each other all put together making transitions awkward. For this to have been a film about angels it was really dark. When thinking of angels you typically think bright colors, and positive feelings. The angels in this movie were the exact opposite, they dressed in all black and were depressed. The majority of the movie was in black and white, then there were peaks of color here and there. For other film makers this was probably a great effect, especially considering this is a film from the 80s, but as a regular audience member this was quite frustrating. A high percentage of movies produced today are in color so having a movie majority black and white pulls us out of our comfort zone. This would be a great film for those that are patient and could sit through a slow developing plot and do not mind something different from the usual . Also those that are into fantasy, as the movie does deal with the angels, would probably enjoy this film. For anyone outside of those categories I do not recommend this movie. This was a hard movie to sit through, the voices were dry, the color was not appealing, and the plot was slow.",

            "content": "\"Wings of Desire\" makes the viewer question a lot of things that are taken for granted in everyday life. Some of these questions include feelings, senses, and general human attention. In \"Wings of Desire\" the main angels, Damiel (Bruno Ganz) and Cassiel (Otto Sander), travel through Berlin that is separated by the Berlin wall. The angels go through the city comforting humans that are going through a hard time or are injured by tapping into their thoughts and trying to convince them not to do something harmful to themselves or make a bad decision. Wim Wenders does a great job making the viewer think during the length of the film. There is a lot of little things that are taken for granted every day. One of which are what we feel on a day to day basis. The angels don't understand why humans think of bad thoughts since they don't have anything to cause these emotions to them.\"Wings of Desire\" shows a different perspective on life. This perspective gives insight on how people who don't receive a lot of attention or are shy feel.\"Wings of Desire\" has a lot of similarities to \"The Wizard of Oz\". The most notable similarity is that the Tin Man in Mervyn LeRoy's hit film longed for a heart throughout the length of the production and the Scarecrow wanted to become human. In \"Wings of Desire\", Damiel had similar wants as the characters in \"The Wizard of Oz\". Eventually, in both movies the character received what they always wanted.. The message \"Wings of Desire\" conveys is that too many people take the little things in life for granted. All in all, I would recommend this film to someone who wants to learn a great lesson and have a new outlook on how the smallest things in life have a big impact on the way humans live.",

            "content": "Wings of Desire is the longest, most nauseating piece of self congratulatory garbage I have ever seen in my entire life. The movie begins with Bruno Ganz, dressed in a sad-looking trench coat atop the edge of a presumably high building. Suddenly, a pair of angelic wings surface around his back. The forced explanation of the fact that this is a movie about angels was thoroughly uninspired. Seeing as how those wings never appear again in the film, where some may have seen a symbol of an angel, I saw Wim Wenders desperately trying to drive home the point that his film was about angels before dragging us into over two hours of angsty, melancholic bullshit. \n\tThe angels in Wings of Desire don't seem to have anything special about them, other than the fact that they can intrude on the unrealistically eloquent thoughts of the citizens of Berlin, without being seen by anyone other than children and some dogs. We're immediately left with a trail of ambiguity and unanswered questions. We find ourselves wondering what the distinction is between adults and children, and when children can stop seeing the angels. We frequently see the angels perched on the rooftops of buildings in Berlin, and even see them jump off, but are never offered an explanation of what happens in between: how did they climb these titanic, unscalable monuments? And when they did hit the ground after plummeting the 50-foot drop, did they stand up again without reacting? We're asked to excuse the technicalities, to avoid the need for extending this movie which already drags on, and to make room for the gloomy, dejected scenes of being reminded how sad the lives of everyone around us really are. \n\tWe follow the angel we saw at the beginning of the film, Damiel (Bruno Ganz), and his occasional meetings with what seems to be his angelic cohort, Cassiel (Otto Sander). We're overwhelmed by the monotonous drone of the thoughts of passersby, as the angels listen in to their minds, many of which seem to add no progression to the story whatsoever, and are only included to make us feel miserable, and to harp on the fact that nobody really enjoys life. A short scene of a young woman anxiously skipping on the sidewalk, while we listen to her nervous thoughts, for example, seems to only serve the purpose of making sure we know the artistic value of the film, and to remind us, once again, that even this unimportant woman to whom we have no emotional connection or attachment, has a sorrowful and woebegone life. \n\tWe get it, life is awful. And if I didn't already know this before, I'm certain of that fact now that I've seen this film. I didn't need to be reminded of it by a repetitive sequence of Wim Wenders patting himself on the back, showing how great he is at making people look unhappy. Well, he did a great job of it with me, that's for sure. The entire first third of the movie could have been condensed into ten minutes of explanation, showing that the angels read thoughts, but all those thoughts are unhappy. We see within the first few moments of this section that Damiel and Cassiel yearn for the ability to experience life through the eyes of the people they observe, and so for the next fourty-five minutes, we feel like we're watching paint dry. It's monotonous and pointless, and serves nothing to advance the plot.\n\tIt isn't until we meet Marion (Solveig Dommartin), that we start to expect something more from the pointless drivel, but alas, we only just start on yet another pointless journey. One that will lead us to burying our face in our hands, and wondering why we didn't buy tickets to see RoboCop instead. \n The one saving factor was the cinematography of a beautifully, void Berlin, but that wasn't enough to save the sickening mess that was the rest of the film. The brief scenes of an aerial view over Berlin served as a nice intermission where we could rub our eyes, and recover from the damage inflicted upon us by the rest of the film. I'll say one thing for this film, and that is that I did feel attracted to the romanticized Berlin. The black and white complemented the gloomy look of the city.\n Brave try Wim Wenders, but you have failed. Bon chance.",

            "content": "Because 1987's \"Wings of Desire\" is more elegiac and more spectacular than the majority of films that come out of the cinematic zeitgeist on a regular basis, I'm pressed to even call it a movie - its astounding bedazzlement announces it as having more in common with the oeuvres of classical painters than it does with modern filmmakers.  It's art, in its most breathtaking form.  It's not magnificent on the Franklin Center-sized scale of a DeMille picture, no, but magnificent in small, subtle ways.  How beautifully it captures the happenstances and miseries that come with the territory of being human; how delicately it asks big questions - and makes bold assertions - without undermining the cerebral capacity of its viewers.  It's fine art, all right.  But because he's more Salvador Dali than he is Jackson Pollock, Wim Wenders's writing and direction is universal and arresting rather than untouchable and ostentatious, thus establishing \"Wings of Desire\" as a piece as appealing to the senses as it is to the emotions.  \n\tFunny, considering how extraordinarily aspirational it is.  As it takes on the  daunting task of trying to maneuver through the complexities of human nature without losing its intimate poignancy, there's a sense, initially that is, that it might be asking too much, that it might be pondering too much, for a movie meant to stir our souls and hit close to home.  But \"Wings of Desire,\" through its screenplay written by Wenders, Peter Handke, and Richard Reitinger, is able to be both philosophical and tremendously personal - for all its fantasy and for all its external mystique, it is deftly romantic and piquantly affecting.\n\tIt's an unthinkable, and yet eccentrically fitting, move to integrate reverie into a film that's almost frighteningly truthful in what it has to say about one's own existence. \"Wings of Desire's\" protagonists are not rainy day men of heroes but instead angels, perpetual onlookers able to read the thoughts of any of Earth's inhabitants at any given moment without being able to do much more than stare, empathize.  They are Damiel and Cassiel (Bruno Ganz and Otto Sander), whom live in separate worlds of black and white and whom are little more than invisible boulevardiers.  Immortal and incapable of doing anything besides affectionately watching their worldly peers unrequitedly, they've accepted their destinies as watchers, never able to touch, taste, or really exist.\n\tBut the damnation of eternal observation starts to become a problem for Damiel when he comes across Marion (Solveig Dommartin), an acutely lonely trapeze artist.  In love with her mind as well as her heart, Damiel wants nothing more than to save her from her despair, which is currently at an all time high due to her latest gig's shutting down.  Cassiel, in the meantime, wanders around the West Berlin the film is set in, going through the motions of his perpetuity until tragedy unexpectedly crosses his path.\n\t\"Wings of Desire,\" dreamy and resplendent, maintains a roaming quality that perhaps excuses the fact that nothing much happens - like a day in the life of a ne'er-do-well, there's a certain sort of fascination to be found within the confines of an ordinary life.  Damiel and Cassiel are as old as time itself, but the notion that they can still find beauty in a world that oftentimes treads into ugliness is the buffer that exclaims that \"Wings of Desire\" is a film of hope, not of dejection.\n\tThough it is the type of movie that's thoroughly aware of the sometimes unbearable anonymity that comes with being alive.  As it wonders why you're you and why you're not me, and why you're there but not here, it also douses itself in a dreary black and white that addresses the blandness that plagues the existence of its angels; only moments taken directly from the point of view of humans is it dressed in gritty color.  Damiel and Cassiel are able to get inside the minds of citizens as easily as changing channels on a television set; to them, the plights and all-too-rare instances of happiness of average individuals is somewhat homogenous.\n\tBut always around the corner is a breakthrough, and \"Wings of Desire\" takes place in a time of transition, in which Damiel is ready to give up his unchosen vocation as a voyeur for love, in which Cassiel is forced to question whether he can emotionally handle being a detached observer for the rest of time, and in which Peter Falk, playing himself (and revealed to have been an angel in the past, too), frets over his decision to become one with the world and not with the otherworldly.\n\tMost moving, however, is the eventually reciprocated love between Damiel and Marion, which works as the film's point of salvation.  For so much of \"Wings of Desire\" is Marion on the cusp of losing her cool, of falling victim to her loneliness induced depression.  Damiel arrives in time to show her that gratifying her doubts wastes her vitality.  When he ultimately makes the choice to give up his immortality in favor of his desire, the film almost seems to ache in its romanticism, though it's tender without being cloying about it.\n\tAs Damiel, Ganz is sensitive and altruistic, his face remarkably expressive; Sander, likewise, is pensive and curious.  Most unforgettable about \"Wings of Desire,\" though, is Dommartin, who made her debut in the film.  In preparation for her role as a trapeze artist, Dommartin committed herself to embodying her character so much so that, after just eight weeks of training, she was able to perform the required death-defying stunts so perfectly that no stunt double was necessary for supplementation.  But in addition to her glorious physicality, Dommartin's characterization is also luminous, understated and mysterious enough to draw comparisons to such art house wunderkinds as Jeanne Moreau and Anna Karina.\n\tMusic acts Crime & the City Solution and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds also make appearances at seminal points in \"Wings of Desire,\" which are as beneficial to the film's allure as its actors.\n\tBut \"Wings of Desire\" is more a showcase for Wenders, highlighting his auteurist skill set with accessibility only sometimes seen in a vast, sometimes self-pleasing, filmography.  The sights and the sounds of the movie are haunting, its emotional palette and vulnerability even more so.  This isn't a film that leaves you days after departing the theater, serving as nothing more than a source of momentary diversion.  It's a masterpiece that rattles you and maybe even alters your being: you feel more alive after having seeing it.",

            "content": "With wide recognition and critical acclaim to its name, Wings of Desire sounded like an innovative German feature.\n\nWings of Desire is a very experimental film. One which experiments with concept, but not so much with content. The premise of the story follows invisible angels who populate Berlin and find fascination with the human condition in such a manner that they are drawn to it. This presents a concept which offers elements of fantasy as the potential backdrop for an exploration of interesting characters, and there is even room to explore the concept of humanity in the process. Unfortunately, I found little of that in Wings of Desire.\nSince the angels cannot communicate with the humans in their immortal form, the majority of the film's earlier scenes depict the thoughts and prayers of the humans expressed through voice-over. For a seemingly endless period of time, the story aimlessly wades through an abundant supply of arbitrary characters whose relevance to the story always proves to be very minimal. It becomes difficult to ascertain which ones are important to keep track of or care about, and there is no room for story development in the process. It's only once the story finds characters worthy of doing anything with that it settles down and becomes a more focused narrative, but it takes so long to get there. There's only so much time I can spend looking at a series of random characters sitting alone and looking over their shoulder while unable to see the other actors standing right next to them before the affair becomes tired and repetitive.\nAfter an extensive period of no narrative development and a lot of slow storytelling, Wings of Desire changes its pace and slowly develops into a story of experiencing the human condition. It takes a while to learn that the aimless narrative has finally settled down, yet it remains a slowly paced film. The characters are given stories, but they continue to move at a glacial rate while relying on the dialogue to entice audiences. Given that I was still struggling to find entertainment value by this point, I gained no interest from what the characters had to say since I refused to attach myself to them on the basis that soon enough the story would move on to another irrelevant figure. The story in Wings of Desire just proved way too elusive and aimless for me, and it prevented me from finding any connection to the characters or the sentimental intentions of the story. Put simply, the film's creative experimentation seems to be the primary source of its critical acclaim, but it was something that I just struggled to embrace. Really, that left me with little to favour with this overly vague and surreal feature.\nAlso, the ending to Wings of Desire is most unsatisfactory. The entire film leads up to a final note which says \"To be continued\". Not only does an underdeveloped story end with a demand that audiences watch a succeeding feature to complete the story, but it doesn't offer enough of an interesting one for me to care enough to try. A film with a narrative this vague and reliant on stylistic experimentation does not present much potential for a sequel, but the fact that there is one really puzzles me. Suffice to say I have little interest in seeing it.\nHowever, I will certify that Wings of Desire is shot very nicely. As much as I found myself disconnected to the narrative, the stylistic pursuit of capturing it was done in a very atmospheric manner thanks to the cinematography. Audiences are constantly kept at a distance from the human characters to present them with a voyeuristic perspective, matched in the way the feature uses voice-over work to depict the inner thoughts of its characters. The cinematography moves very gently to match the steady rate of the film's pace, and the use of colour is praiseworthy. The delicate use of sepia provides an effectively surreal feeling, and it gives viewers a much greater appreciation for the natural colours of the world when the visuals revert back to their natural state. Wings of Desire manages to use strong cinematography to capture its mood and emphasize the beauty in the scenery with a natural grace to it. The gentle editing of the film and particularly its use of slow fades as a transition help to maintain this mood.\nThe cast also convey an effective grip over the elusive nature of the narrative. The standout is the talents of Bruno Ganz who leads the film as Damiel, an angel who learns what it is to experience love. The film's treatment of the theme may have gone over my head very much, but I lost no appreciation for Bruno Ganz's performance in the process. The man captures an emotionally restrained performance to depict someone who progressively begins to realize what human emotion is, and he does it with a subtle gleefulness to his curiosity. This provides the actor with a charming edge that makes his progressive interactions with Solveig Dommartin seem all the more touching. The man doesn't say too much in Wings of Desire which keeps him shrouded in mystery, yet he uses this to his benefit by intriguing audiences into realizing that he is the most important character to the story. Much of what he says comes simply from his facial expressions which are always rich with an element of wonder to him, ensuring that he captures the mystical element to his character naturally. Bruno Ganz leads Wings of Desire with passionate dedication and subtlety which is very admirable.\nSolveig Dommartin also delivers a beautiful effort. On top of the remarkable circus skills she learned in a period of 8 weeks for the film, Solveig Dommartin manages to convey the feeling of a troubled young girl in an adult's body. She is confused with the meaning of existence and cannot find appreciation for her talents, and her voice-over work presented against the backdrop of her very physical performance says everything about her. Her facial expressions rarely change, but they convey her emotionally confused nature while her physical movements do the talking. Solveig Dommartin provides audiences with a character who is dedicated to her talents but aware of her lack of worth in emptiness of existence, and the simple grace of her effort is beautiful.\n\nWings of Desire has some talented actors, but its ambitions to experiment with an extremely vague story end up rather aimless and slow without any progressive development to boast.",

He's quickly forgotten once Wenders takes to the streets, and then remembered again at irregular intervals when the director snaps out of distraction.\nWenders is plagued by a childlike curiosity and a love of all things melancholy. He's a man obsessed with the sensations and stylistics surrounding the story he's trying to tell. The result is two-hours plus of meandering, moody abstraction and pseudo-philosophy, with the occasional belated revelation or on-key set piece - each of these more maddening than the last in its lost potential to punch us in the gut.\nWings of Desire is an epic poem, with a heart that hangs on a thread, and drifts far out to sea in the second act.",

Their raison d'être is, as Cassiel says, to \"assemble, testify, preserve\" reality. Damiel and Cassiel have always existed as angels; they existed in Berlin before it was a city, and before there were even any humans. Among the Berliners they encounter in their wanderings is an old man named Homer (Curt Bois), who, unlike the Greek poet Homer, dreams of an \"epic of peace.\" Cassiel follows the old man as he looks for the then-demolished Potsdamer Platz in an open field, and finds only the graffiti-covered Berlin Wall. Although Damiel and Cassiel are pure observers, visible only to children, and incapable of any physical interaction with our world, Damiel begins to fall in love with a profoundly lonely circus trapeze artist named Marion (Solveig Dommartin). She lives by herself in a caravan, dances alone to the music of Crime & the City Solution, and drifts through the city. At the same time we encounter actor Peter Falk, who has arrived in Berlin to make a film about Berlin's Nazi past. As the film progresses, it emerges that Peter Falk was once an angel, who, having grown tired of always observing and never experiencing, renounced his immortality to become a participant in the world. While Damiel is omniscient and lives in eternity, Marion is mortal and lives the human aspiration to be immortal and perfect by wearing a pair of white wings, climbing a rope, swinging from a bar in a cheap circus, toying with death, as there is no net, and with her human clumsiness reaches upward to the grace expressed in the idea of an angel. Her aspiration is both absurd and divine. As one can take only so much of infinity, Damiel's longing is in the opposite direction, for the genuineness and limitedness of human existence in the world. He eventually embarks on this thought with the full realisation that there is no turning back if he decides to do so...\n\nWim Wender´s \"Wings Of Desire\" is yet another movie that has been on my \"to see list\" and it´s been there forever it seems. First of all, I am sad to say that I didn´t like it as much as I truly hoped I would do. I have had this sense of this being a truly beautiful piece of film that would mesmerise me and give me a shot of love straight into my heart. We get this tale of two angels moving around in West Berlin before the wall came down and eventually one of the angels make the decision to become human to experience everything on the \"other\" side so to speak. That´s a great piece of script in my point of view. The first half is quite fragmented (both in editing and filming) and in the world of the angels everything is in black/white and in this almost lifeless and dreamlike existence, life moves along in a slow pace while all the angels listens to the thoughts of people. The dialogue is abstract most of the times and the characters inner thoughts are mostly spoken in riddles or metaphors (nothing wrong in that), but it becomes tiresome the longer we move into the running time in my opinion. The idea of putting Peter Falk in the movie as himself and exposing him as a former angel, is a great idea. But, I think that Wender could´ve used Falk a bit more in the movie. \"Wings Of Desire\" is told in a non traditional cinematic way, and I like that, but I do think that the movie really becomes interesting once Damiel has shed his wings and become a human. Then it becomes lifelike and colourful (literally), I reckon showing the beauty of the life we do live and are graced with. Bruno Ganz is great as Damiel and he shows what a strong actor he is without saying so much. I think as well that \"Wings Of Desire\" is a nice homage to the beautiful city of Berlin just prior to the wall came down. And the end (or final part of the movie you might say) was not as strong as it could´ve been either. \"Wings Of Desire\" is different with a great script/idea as a foundation, but Wender doesn´t fully reach what I wanted to see. Interesting fact is that all of the black & white sequences were shot through a one-of-a-kind filter made from a stocking that belonged to cinematographer Henri Alekan's grandmother. And filming the actual Berlin Wall was prohibited, so a replica of the wall had to be built close to the original twice. The first fake wall warped in the rain because the contractor cheated the producers and built it from wood.",

The movie Wings of Desire is set in and filmed in Berlin, Germany. The director is Wim Wenders and the writers are Peter Handke and Wim Wenders. The genre is a romantic fantasy and was filmed in 1987. This movie was not based on a book. The storyline is about angels watching and studying the people in Berlin and listening to their thoughts. The story mostly focuses on two angels named Damiel, actor Bruno Ganz, and Cassiel, actor Otto Sander. These angels are not your stereotypical angels; they appear to look just as normal men. No one can see them except for children, and some people can feel their presence. They travel all around and observe the people and comfort those who need comforting, though they are not all successful. \nThe story focuses on an old man who just wants to be heard and valued by the younger generation, a woman involved in a failing circus due to lack of money, and several other groups of people. The angel, Damiel, is drawn to a trapeze artist with some dark thoughts and eventually falls in love with this character named Marion, actress Solveig Dommartin. His love for her brings him to give up his immortality to be a human and experience all things for himself. Damiel eventually find Marion, who remembers him from a dream, and they automatically stay together. In the end, the movie reveals there is a sequel and leaves you with many questions and some strong thoughts on how to view your own life.\n\tI give Wings of Desire three and a half stars out of five because the movie is like no other movie, it captured my attention, and gave me a positive feeling on life, but the movie does tend to confuse the audience at times and jumps around a bit. In my opinion, the plot of this story was very slow. Though it was interesting and made me curious, there is plenty of unnecessary scenes that were off topic from the main story of the movie that had my completely lost. The movie was quite choppy and jumped around. The cinematography is unusual from the average movies today. Parts of the movie were shot in black and white and other parts were in color; this was unclear to me till later that when the scene was in black and white, this was in the angels point of view, but when the scene was color, this was in a humans point of view. I found this to be an interesting idea of filming, but was confusing for a bit. The use of different languages is through the movie; the main language is German, but other languages are used randomly throughout the movie. Most of the narration is the thoughts that the angels hear or the angels' own thoughts, there are several scenes of people communicating with each other though. The script flows nicely throughout the movie and includes several quotes with strong meanings. \n\tWings of Desire takes your full concentration to understand what is happening throughout the movie. Many quotes and scenes are used to make the audience feel and think a certain way. The angels are meant to represent the audience because they are observing the scene of the world; all they can do is watch. As a human there is color and when Damiel becomes human he gets to experience the world for himself. He learns about taste, smells, and what thinks feel like. He experiences the freedom to live. I believe the message Wim Wenders wants the audience to understand is to appreciate life and see the beauty in the world because you have the option to not only observe life, but to live life as well. Damiel decides to give up the safety and immorality of being an angel to experience what it means to be human and take chances. \n-Alice Kerl",

            "content": "\"Wings of Desire\", a film by Wim Wenders, is a classic movie with a not-so-classic story. The angels in the movie are invisible, human-like figures who watch over the people of Berlin. Throughout the movie, the angels form indirect relationships with some of these people, considering that they cannot see, hear, or even know that the angels are there. This makes the plot very interesting and keeps the audience's full attention on the screen. Even though the storyline is somewhat slow, the plot is what keeps it going. There are a lot of twists and turns in the plot that keep the movie interesting. Observing the physical universe for some time causes an angel named Damiel to develop a desire to be human. This alone is a huge turning point in the story and plays a big part in the hidden meaning behind this movie. \n\tThere are many aspects of this movie that play a part in making it a masterpiece. One of those aspects is the acting. The actors in \"Wings of Desire\" make it feel like you aren't even watching a movie. The way that the movie is shot, along with the performance of the actors, make it seem like you are watching something actually happen in real life. Considering the slow storyline, the acting in this movie is subtle, but very bold at the same time. The actors seem to find a way to grasps the audience's attention very strongly. This is important, considering that most of the movie is in black and white and is slow-paced. Without the acting being as great as it was, \"Wings of Desire\" would not be the classic movie that it is today. \n\tThe cinematography of this movie is another aspect that caught my attention. The way that this movie was shot gives the audience a completely difference viewing experience compared to other movies. There is such a variety of camera angles and lighting that make the entire movie a pleasure to watch. All of these things keep the audience engaged, but comfortable, for the entire movie. There are a fair amount of point-of-view shots that make you feel like you are in the movie, and that the actors are talking to you. This alone makes the audience feel connected with this movie. It grabs the audience and makes them feel one with the actors and the setting. During the story, the movie is shot in black and white and eventually changes to full color. This gives the movie a unique feel to it, considering that most people today have only watched colored movies and television. The black and white makes it seem like an old-time movie, but with a modern touch. All of these aspects of the cinematography play a large part in making \"Wings of Desire\" a movie that is hard to stop watching. \n\tThe choice of music in this film is something that is worth paying attention to. Most of the music in this movie is soft and comforting, making it easy to listen to. It also goes along perfectly with the overall vibe of this movie, which causes the audience to have a better grasp on what the director was trying to make them feel. The director intended for the audience to have an emotional outlook on the movie, and the music played a huge role in that. \n\t\"Wings of Desire\" is a very memorable movie because of its ability to capture the audience, even though it is subtle and slow. The setting, plot, cinematography, acting, and music are all key aspects in making this movie such a classic. Even being an action movie kind of man, this movie was able to keep me engaged the entire time. The director added so many little, but noticeable, things throughout the movie that causes it to have that certain something that makes it hard to stop watching.",

            "content": "A movie about all the little things, Wings of Desire is a film filled with different aspects and views on life. From the beginning the audience is captivated by the poem, \"When the child was a child\", and continues to try and make a connection with the significance that the poem has, as it plays only in certain scenes. This is a very complex film for its time.\nThrough the movie we are chauffeured by Angles, Damiel and Cassiel, as they take the audience through what eternity is as an angel. Very impressive acting throughout the entire film, as the adults seem unaware of the angels among them. This film is taking place in Berlin, which was a depressing city in the late 1800's, but a perfect place to film a movie of hope and gratefulness. With angels all about, what does this story entail? The plot begins with the Angel Damiel and Cassiel, we are allowed to see life through their perspective. Damiel however, experiences a woman of gold, and even though he only sees her in black and white, he knows there is something special about her. Wenders (the director) also slips an old storyteller in the movie signifying his love for good stories and how rare it is these days to come across one. The movie is so advanced, with plots of all sorts of human trials going on, all supervised, but never affected by the angel's presence. And these are no ordinary angels, no wings or halos or even glow, instead they walk around Berlin in their long trench coats with slick backed hair.\nAppearing as a regular human. \nThe director also allows us to realize how we take little things like color, grass, and even blood for granted, as he shows us that the angel cannot experience color or even time. Majority of the movie is played through the angels eyes, which is black and white. It makes us want to see color and realize just how boring black and white can be. Until Damiel experiences a desire to love a beautiful young trapeze artist, who he watches day to day, and even though she cannot see him she knows she can feel something. As weird as that sounds, something else weird happens when Damiel falls from the sky of Berlin. He then realizes now that he can experience life. Coffee, cigarettes, love, color, everything that he so desperately wanted.\n This is a great movie but when it first starts it is easy to form the opinion that you don't like it or it makes no sense, but as you begin to give it a chance and keep along with the subtitles, Wenders slowly proves why his film is worth the watch. Movies today do not really compare, directors of today focus more on being \"typical\" which really is a waste of money. When viewing \"Wings of Desire\" from the start we are intrigued by the title and then when we see how Wenders was able to work in so many different scenarios of an angel's life, we realize how genius it was.\n What seemed like it would be a movie about a war turned out to be completely different. There were times where the film got boring and draggy. It was very slow paced with classical music in some scenes and rock star music in others which was quite disturbing. The director should have dealt with the sound and the way the music came out to maybe soften it, but maybe he was trying to make it as if this is what the angels heard and maybe the angels where disturbed to. It made me look at the way we go through life and how silly we seem and how quick we are to push everything else to the side only to please ourselves. It was inspirational but also somewhat mind-blowing, that someone could even think this movie out in the late 1800s. There are mixed emotions about this film, not sure if the director wanted us to reevaluate our lives but it is definitely an intricate film.",

            "content": "\"The film evokes a mood of reverie, elegy and meditation.\" Said by reviewer Roger Ebert who believes that the movie \"Wings of Desire\" by Wim Wenders deserves four stars for its excellence of being a great movie. In contrast, is the film also excellent in confusing its audience? It is almost a guarantee that whoever views this film for the first time will not understand the actual perspective of the director. From the perception of displaying the movie in black and white to the angels that are watching over the city, and no, these are not the same angels with the golden halos and majestic arrays of white happening all around them either. This gives the audience a perspective of life through the eyes of an angel.\nThe movie begins by introducing two angels, Damiel and Cassiel played by Bruno Ganz and Otto Sander, following these two spirits as they watch over the city of Berlin. Their overall characterization would have been misinterpreted if it were not for the beautiful white wings that were being shown on Damiel's back as he was looking over Berlin. It is strange to classify them with the name angels seeing that no human can be saved by their presence. They can only observe and arrive at the times where hope seems to be obsolete. Such as the trapeze artist being afraid of falling, or when there was a man shown jumping from the side of the building. Their dull characteristics exemplify how they are not merely two guardian angels that are full of life and happiness; their only agenda is to observe. Noticing how their characters are not speaking when they come across the humans, only being able to speak to one another in the German language implies the notion of the two angels portraying the feeling of a dead spirit among the humans. \nThe projected setting for this movie was superb in coinciding with the mood the director wanted the audience to feel. Dating the movie back to the time where Berlin was battling through the Holocaust and other historic tragedies, displayed a city that was distraught and in dire need of rescuing. The rough streets and buildings that are in the process of rebuilding or construction show the struggle that this city was going through. Therefore, stresses directly towards Damiel and Cassiel's performances in only being noted as spectators to what the world is coming to. Their bland facial expressions towards every occurrence in the movie assure that they have seen it all and now Damiel is ready to feel what it is like to be human. This was due to the switching of the film showing in black and white to color during the movie. This switch allowed the audience to see a glimpse into the vision of what these particular angels would see if they were human. Showing emphasis that they are merely dead spirits that see in black and white. Having that change of scenery was a sure indication that there is still life to be found in this film. \nThe one area where the movie explores its complexity was in the plot. There is no designed plot for this film. That could easily be depicted through the cinematography work for this film. Showing floating views over cities, the fast angle changes for a particular scene, in addition to the glides through certain areas. \"It does not intrude; it observes\" Roger Ebert states in amusement to this area of the film. The plot of this story grows old and slow, but the audience could never become impatient because no one can predict the next possible stage in the movie. So many instances happen in \"Wings of Desire\" that one can become clueless to what may happen next. From the amount of camera changes and scene switches, it seems as if they are showing a normal day in Berlin, Germany. This is what makes the plot intriguing yet complicated to those watching. \nThere is no possible way that you cannot be engaged into this film because of the amount of complex symbolism and difficult comprehension it possesses. It is as if you are seduced into this movie. It draws in a crowd by forcing one to think for a deeper meaning in the director's intentions of the film with an intellectual mindset.",

            "content": "Originally titled Der Himmel über Berlin, translated to The Sky Over Berlin, this German movie is about two angels that watch over the people of Berlin while influencing their lives in a peculiar way. These angels, Damiel (Bruno Ganz) and Cassiel (Otto Sander), have been around for centuries and they can hear people's thoughts, fears and desires. Even though they are content with being angels, Damiel often contemplates becoming human so he can fulfill his desires. This film, which I would rate five stars, was written and directed by Wim Wenders and was released in 1987.\n\nWenders made a wise decision by choosing the setting of this film to be Berlin. At this time in history, World War II had ended and the city of Berlin was still recovering. The people of Berlin were depressed because there was a Great Wall separating East and West Berlin. This caused many people started losing hope, their jobs and they started giving up on their dreams. Luckily, the angels were always there to give some positive and encouraging thoughts. Their purpose was to watch over the city of Berlin and its people. This film executed the purpose of it being set in Berlin and the angels' purposes very well.\n\nDamiel and Cassiel were not the only angels in the film but they were the main ones. The only people that could see them were young children and humans that were once angels. There were a few differences between these angels. Cassiel is completely content with being an angel forever while Damiel has other intentions. At some point Damiel tells Cassiel, \"It's great to live by the spirit, but sometimes I'm fed up with my spiritual existence.\" While the people of Berlin had desires so did Damiel. He desperately wanted to be human so he could feel, see and experience. Towards the middle of the film, Damiel went to a circus act and fell in love with the trapeze artist. Her name was Marion, played by Solveig Dommartin. This was another reason why he wanted to become human so badly, to love. This was the main difference between the two angels besides their appearance.\n\nAn obvious observation in the film was that it was mostly in black and white but sometimes in color. The black and white represented the angels' point of view and how they saw the world and the people in it. Humans can see in color so when the film showed in color it was the humans' point of view and what they saw. This effects the film because it gives an example of why one of the angels wanted to become human.\n\nThroughout the film, the audience is brought to scenes with an old man talking and thinking. This man is named Homer (Curt Bois) who is considered the storyteller. Many times he is questioning why the world has changed so much and he is upset that it will never go back to the way it was. \"The old man wonders why we cannot just have peace but always war. If he gives up, mankind won't have a storyteller, and humans will forget their childhood,\" (Regan-Porter 1). Without the storyteller he would have no job, there would be no peace and the children would have no stories to listen too. This is why he was so important. He felt as though the city and people needed him so he can bring all of the people together again.\n\nWings of Desire was an exceptional film for audiences of all ages to watch. It demonstrates that you are never too old to have your dreams and desires fulfilled. Also that even in the roughest patches of life, hope and love can always be found. \"This story of angels is really an examination of what it means to be human-in the most profound sense but via the smallest, most trivial details,\" (Regan-Porter 2).\n\nReferences\nRegan-Porter, Tim. \"Wings of Desire (The Criterion Collection).\" Movies.

It is this powerlessness, as well as this longing for physical and mental feeling, that eventually gives an angel named Damiel (Bruno Ganz) a need to become more immersed in life.\nIn the early parts Wim Wenders' film there really is not any plot that can be followed or know what is happening because, Damiel and another angel named Cassiel (Otto Sander) just travel through the divided city of Berlin, watching and listening to train commuter's thought process but sometimes they come down to help a wounded man, to put a hand on the shoulder of a young man considering suicide, or even comfort a pregnant woman on her way to the hospital.

            "content": "Wings of Desire was made in 1987, directed by the Oscar nominated German filmmaker, Wim Wenders. It was originally titled Der Himmel uber Berlin, meaning The Sky Over Berlin. It takes place in numerous locations in Berlin. It is as if the camera is just hovering over Berlin at all times. The actors in the film speak in German with English subtitles, only one actor speaks English in the movie.. It is mostly shown in black and white.  Wings of Desire is unlike any movie that I have ever seen. From the cinematography to the plot twist, it was all such a different movie experience. The title seems to give away the theme of the movie when in actuality; it does not have anything to do with it.\nWings of Desire features two angels named Damiel played by Bruno Ganz and Cassiel played by Otto Sander, who go around Berlin listening to the thoughts of the distressed people, looking to soothe them. They are angels so no one can see or touch them and they cannot feel the people that they try to soothe. In Wings of Desire, three people are looked upon closely, Marion, a trapeze artist (Solveig Dommartin), Homer, a story teller (Curt Bois), and Peter Faulk, playing himself, as veteran angel who became a human. The acting in the film was not like anything I had ever seen. There was a minimum amount of open mouth dialogue compared to other movies. Throughout the movie, the speaking was basically inside of their heads. The angels would hear them speaking about their problems and situations in hushed tones within their conscience. The movie took a twist when Damiel fell in love with Marion. He then, longed to be a human. He wanted to feel, taste, and smell what other humans felt. He was an angel all of his life, so he never got the chance to experience and appreciate what humans did.\nThe movie would transition from the angels' point of view to the humans' point of view. The way that this was separated was between black and white then to color. Black and white represented the angel's point of view while color represented the humans' point of view. For example, at one point in the movie it showed Damiel looking at Marion in the eyes of love, in black and white then transitioned to color to show what Marion was seeing. Other times, in the background someone would recite the poem, Song of Childhood as the scenes would show people going through their situations. The words 'When a child of a child'' would play as people would reminisce about the things that they wish they would have done in their life. The people learn to appreciate the things that they never appreciated before.\nWings of Desire was a very complicated movie in the beginning. However, throughout the movie it became easier to understand through the actions of the angels. In the last few moments of the movie, Peter Faulk was telling Damiel how it was to drink hot coffee and rub your hands together to war the up when you are cold. That is what made him really decide that he desired to be a human. The director did a great job at creating a suspenseful movie. Throughout the movie, Wim Wenders created suspense with Marion and her job at the circus. She always thought that she would never be able to live out her dream. Many parts of the movie she was contemplating whether she was even good at it or not.  By the end of the movie she reached what she was ultimately trying to get to. She made a story for herself and wants to challenge the audience to do the same. She ends the movie by saying, ''this is my story, now you go and make your own.''",

            "content": "A high rating is the last thing I thought I would give this movie, after watching the first scene, but here I am, falling right into place with the many other high reviews. \"Wings of Desire\" is not a film you can judge just by its first impression on you, it requires you to truly open your mind to what the filmmakers are trying to portray to the audience, and understand how each and every aspect they are incorporating into the scenes plays into this image. This movie is not one that will catch the eye of many college freshman today in America, but after analyzing different aspects and meanings of the different scenes, the film lives up to its high ratings.\n\tThis movie's title was originally translated to be \"The Sky/Heaven Over Berlin\", which does an awesome job at showing the true aspect of the film. During the time period in Berlin, the wall had just gone up and separated East and West Berlin. This title is excellent for drawing in and audience that is knowledgeable about this situation at the time, and also adding meaning to the film itself. The wall doesn't go up into the sky, making it the one area of Berlin that was not split, and allowing the angels to see everything and help both sides of the city. The American title being \"Wings of Desire\" is, in my opinion, needed to draw in an audience that does not live in or around Berlin and does not have that natural motive to go in and watch a movie that is completely set around that location. It is also kind of ironic once you break the film down to its many meanings. The title states \"Wings of Desire\" when actually the angels in the film are desiring to rid themselves of their wings to experience things that the humans get to experience.\n\tThe film goes back and forth between black and white, and colored scenes. The scenes without color are meant to portray what the angels see. They cannot see color because their main objective is to solely observe the acts of the humans. They are not given the ability that humans are, to experience senses. Black and white does a good job at truly setting in this allusion. When you see black and white you don't experience as much emotion and senses from the scene, so being that the angels do not have the ability to understand time, or feel the different emotions of humans, the decision to keep these scenes without color, aids in adding more to the mood of the film for the audience to experience. It's a very black and white, bland world to live in, without the privileges we take for granted daily, so it was smart on the producer's behalf to incorporate the differences in color transitions between scenes into the film. This effect allows the audiences to connect with the main characters even more.\n\tYou are introduced to many characters throughout this film, but it's not hard to eventually find who the filmmakers are focusing on. You will notice throughout, that as the angels pass different thoughts of the people around them fumble their way into the ears of the angels, and us, the audience. The fact that we are hearing their thoughts, does not make them a main character that we need to focus on, rather, it simply is there to majority of the time display detail, and emotion to the audience of the film. For example, at one scene in the film, one of the main angels passes a motorcycle accident, with the driver critically injured on the sidewalk. The angels observes for a moment, giving us the chance to hear, and understand the thoughts of this victim. Once the angel takes action, and attempts to change the thoughts of the dying man, we hear his thoughts change to the focus of the small and enjoyable details of human life. This scene adds to the overall theme of the movie, even though this character was only introduced to the audience at this one point. I believe the directors decision to incorporate scenes like this one, aided in the emotional understanding of \"Wings of Desire.\"\n\tThis movie is definitely one that will make its audience think for a bit, to truly be able to grasp the meaning trying to be portrayed to us, but after it is found, the film becomes a grand creation in the minds of many.",

            "content": "The romantic fantasy \"Wings of Desire\" directed by Wim Wenders was released in 1988.  The film is about two angels who roam the streets of Berlin and observe humans.  Wings of Desire is difficult to understand at first because it is in German and subtitles are used.  The movie was very interesting if only you could get passed the horrible subtitles and the German language.\n\tThe two angels Damiel (Bruno Ganz) and Cassiel (Otto Sanders) are invisible to humans except children and other angels.  They go around listening to peoples thoughts and they often comfort the ones who are feeling depressed or stressed.  Damiel falls in love with a trapeze artist named Marion (Solveig Dommartin).  Once he falls in love with her he realizes that he wants to be human and be able to feel, taste, and experience things.  Every night he finds himself at the circus where Marion performs.  One night he was there and he read her thoughts about how she was scared to fall because it was a full moon.  After this takes place Damiel talks to Cassiel about how he wants to be human but Cassiel doesn't agree with him.\n\tThe one thing that makes the movie interesting is the cinematography.  The film is in black and white but also in color.  Cinematographer Henri Alekan had impressive transitions from the change to black and white to color.  The black white was used only when the point of view was seen from the angles eyes.  Therefore color was used only when the point of view was seen by humans.   You may begin to ponder on this and wonder why he made it like that.  The black white is stating that angels can't see in color only the humans can.  Just like the angels in the movie Henri Alekan's camera seems like it just glides around the sky and observe things.  The photography throughout the film is smooth and it doesn't get faster or slower with the change of what's going on.\n\tThe language in the film makes you just want to change the movie to something that makes more sense.  The film is in German and it gets complicated to follow along with the subtitles and pay attention to what is going on at the same time.  Poetic language is also used throughout the movie.  The poem \"When the child was a child\" pops up during the entire of movie.  The poem is describing how children used to be and how they are now.  The mood of the film is calm.  It shows the patience in the angels and how the just observe and don't rush into anything.\n\tThe movie is very slow going and it takes a while to understand everything that is going on.  The one thing I liked about it is how it keeps you on edge and guessing about what is going to happen next or if the angels are going to take the fall to become human.  It makes you think about life and how we can't take everything granite.  The angels are wanting to be able to feel, smell, and taste things just like we do and are willing to give up their wings to be able to do that.  \n\tMy opinion on the movie is that it could be better if it wasn't in German and if we didn't have to use subtitles.  When watching a movie you want to be able to focus on everything that is going on not looking at the bottom of the screen reading along with the words.  If you can get passed how slow the movie is and the horrible language and subtitles I definitely recommend you to take the guide with the angels around the city of Berlin.  At the end of the film you will be satisfied you did.",

            "content": "When you hear someone say \"angels\", what are your first thoughts? One would probably think of angelic creatures with halos on top of their heads and big beautiful wings. Many of us also have a belief  that everyone has a guardian angel that looks over us and that we can only see or dream of our own angel. This particular movie does not demonstrate these beliefs . The angels in this film are dressed like the normal people around them. Only the children who believe in them and the people who like them can see the angels, or feel the angel's presence. There is a message behind this movie, but it is difficult to comprehend. It is also difficult to keep up with what is going on, and what the director is trying to portray because of the movie's subtitles. \n\tThere are three major characters in the film, two of them are angels. In the film, God feels that his creations are unappreciated by humans, therefore, he sends his angels to witness his creations. Damiel is one of the angels that have been around for centuries. He roams the streets of Berlin sometimes with the company of his fellow angel, Cassiel. These angels stand on tall statues and buildings reading the thoughts of people who pass by. They also comfort people who are dealing with hardships in their lives. \n\tThe title of this film, \"Wings of Desire\", can directly describe Damiel's feelings towards Marion. Marion is a trapeze artist who performs every night for a financially struggling circus. Damiel can read her thoughts about how she is afraid she is going to fall one night because of her superstitions of the full moon. Damiel fell in love with Marion. He shares with Cassiel about his thoughts. He questions Cassiel, he wonders what it is like to feel, to taste, or simply to fall in love. Damiel feels as if his life has no purpose, he wanted to be seen, to be like the living human beings around him. The poem in this movie suggests Damiel's thoughts. The poem mentions a child who does not know who it is, who has no opinion, no habits. The child also asks itself, what am I? Why am I the person I am? Why am I not you? how did I come to be? These questions are also asked by Damiel. \n\tIn my opinion, this movie would have been better if there was a translator instead of subtitles. It was hard to comprehend what the storyteller was saying and what was actually going on in the movie. Especially when the scene completely changes from modern time to World War II. There were many great messages that I noticed from the movie. One of them is how if you want something bad enough and you go after it, you would eventually achieve it. Damiel wanted to feel and fall in love with a beautiful woman named Marion, he strived to become human and made it possible. Another message I can pick out of this is that love is strong and it can break any walls or obstacles that comes in between it. \n\tOne great thing that made me enjoy this movie is how the majority of the movie was in black and white, but then the colors started showing up after Damiel became human. To me the black and white represented death and the colors represented life. To others the black and white is simply means that the angels could not see in colors, and so when Damiel became human, he can see colors. Over all I enjoyed this movie, I would recommend watching the movie first and then read about it online to understand it more in details.",

This movie created by Wim Wenders for the most part is a black and white movie spoken in German with English subtitles. Seems boring right? Actually the Wings of Desire is a really good movie if you can get past the german speaking. This movie is good because of the acting, camera shots, storyline, and the overall message even though the transitions are not all that great.\n\tThe acting in this movie is full of experienced actors who do a great job at portraying their role in the movie. The main character Damiel who is a troubled angel with the hope of being human is played by Bruno Ganz. Bruno is a swiss born actor who has appeared in many german films and specialized in romantic roles. Otto Sander plays Cassiel who is the more dedicated angel out of the two. otto is a well known actor who started out in the marines studying theatre science. The acting in this movie deserves a full bucket of pop corn.\n\tThe camera shots of this movie were excellent. Though at times there was too much head rooms in the upper thirds of the screen the shots were good at distinguishing the angels from the humans by taking different camera angles when Damiel or Cassiel appear on screen. The best shot of the movie could possibly be when the movie opens up and they pan the city and the buildings around it. The camera shots in this movie deserves a full bucket of pop corn because the pans and angles made the  quality of the movie overall better. \n\tThe storyline of Wings of Desire is pretty clever. Though the movie starts off slow it quickly hooks in the audience by what it appears like addressing the audience with a couple of lines and camera angles. The storyline consists of two angels Damiel and Cassiel are in Berlin making observations of the world around the people they give comfort to. For the most part no one can see Damiel and Cassiel except the children, although those who believe may feel their presence. Damiel is the more curious out of the two angels with the lust of being human and wanting to feel real emotions. At the end of the movie Damiel turns human for the trapeze artist Marion who he falls in love with. The storyline of Wings of Desire deserves a half a bucket of popcorn because even though the storyline is interesting the movie does have a slow start.\n\tThe transitions of the Wings of Desire is about the only thing that the producer and director could have done better on. The transitions from shot to shot are real choppy and tend to leave the viewer lost at times because the settings of each shot seem to change with a new character in each one for at least the first half of the movie. This makes the movie really hard to understand on the first viewing which can mean it will take a second time to watch the movie to fully appreciate what is happening. The transitions deserve an empty bucket of popcorn because of the jumping back and forth of shots. \nWim Wenders overall message he is trying to portray of Wings of Desire is what really catches the audience in the end and leaves us with a positive outlook on life. The overall message is everyone has their own story so no matter how hard life gets you still have a story of your own to make so go out and do it. The message of the movie deserves a full bucket of popcorn. \n\tThe movie as a whole deserves a half a bucket of popcorn. Yes the ratings for most of the topics are really good but the transitions is a mood killer. The fact that some had to view the movie twice to understand the movie is un appealing despite the fact that the Wings of Desire is a really good movie. If you like movies with a powerful message and don't mind knowing you have to watch the movie twice I recommend that most viewers should give this movie a chance.",

            "content": "Wings of Desire gives a great perspective of what an angel's view on the world might be. The movie takes place in Berlin where an angel, Damiel (Bruno Ganz), imagines what it would be like to be human. He wants to experience emotions, time, and ignorance. Opposing his view is the angel Cassiel (Otto Sander) who thinks that they would be better off not hoping for something like that. The desire that Damiel has over shadows that of Cassiel's, and makes for a very insightful movie that shows why life is not to be taken for granted.\n\tIn one of the first scenes of the movie, Damiel can be seen standing on a towering building looking down at city below. He is observing people just walking and living their everyday lives. His angel wings can be seen protruding out of his back. This makes the audience aware that Damiel is not a depressed person looking to jump, but is actually an angel. This scene basically defines what the point of an angel is. Angels are used as a sort of record keeper for God. They have seen everything from the beginning of time, but do not actually follow time themselves. It is interesting when Damiel has the idea to break away from his fate as an angel.\n        Damiel shows very human like characteristics when he falls in love with a human named Marion (Solveig Dommartin). He first sees her when she is swinging on the trapeze, practicing with her failing circus troupe and instantly knows that he must be with her. Although, because he is an angel, all Damiel can do is watch as she goes through her life. It is important to note from this that the movie shows angels as imperfect. It is easy to assume that angels are free of desires, but this is a great example of how human they can be. \n         The use of colors in Wings of Desire is also important for the audience. The majority of the film is in black and white with color taking full effect for half of that time. The black and white is used to show the angel's perspective. It offers that the angel has a very bland existence. They cannot feel pain or understand colors, but know everything that has and will happen. This takes out the ability to be surprised by anything which makes everything seem boring and uneventful. On the other hand, color, is used to represent the exact opposite. It makes the view of the world bright and hopeful. This is used for the perspective of the humans. It shows the beauty of people being able to experience what the world has to offer. This contrast of colors can help the viewer transition and distinguish between the human world and that of the angels. \n          The overall message that Wings of Desire sends off is to pursue anything you want in life. It doesn't mean that the journey will be easy, but if the hope and belief in success is strong enough, anything is possible. The movie also contains, if not more importantly, the idea of appreciating the small things in life. Something as simple as feeling the wind or looking at plants is what makes life amazing. This film would be perfect for anyone questioning if life is worth living. I greatly enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to anyone I know.",

            "content": "Wings Of Desire, directed by Wim Wenders, is a film set in Berlin that is designed to leave it's viewer with a new outlook on life by the movie's end. Wenders directs a very inspirational movie as he simply implies the idea that one should simply appreciate life along with who they are and what they have in life. The movie overall is a very good movie and the director really does a great job portraying his intended lesson to his viewers. \n\tWings Of Desire is a film designed to teach its viewer to appreciate life and not take it for granted. One should simply just accept who they are and make the most of their life. In today's world people often doubt themselves and fail to recognize how good they truly have it. There are others out there who would love to be in the shoes of someone better off than they are. This is what Wim Wenders is trying to portray throughout the movie. Set in poverty stricken Berlin (post WWII), the film follows the lives of two angels, Damiel (Bruno Ganz) and Cassiel (Otto Sander).  The director set them as an audience to spectate the everyday lives of those in the city. Wings of Desire isn't exactly an action packed film as it is more of a drama designed to teach a lesson. Being as the movie is set in a post WWII setting where times are pretty rough for many during this period, a great deal of realism is displayed throughout the course of the move. At one point in the movie Cassiel bears witness to a man deep in depression who commits suicide by jumping off of a building.\n\tWings of Desire is filmed from the point of view of two different kinds of people, angels and humans. Damiel, serves as a spectator over the lives of those the city of Berlin. As an angel, Damiel cannot be seen by many throughout the movie and can only watch and wonder what it's like to feel experience what these people really do. As the movie develops, he soon would long for the love of a young lady, Marion. Marion (Solveig Dommartin), is a trapeze artist who performs for the local circus. Unfortunately the local circus finds itself in turmoil as it is essentially broke and is forced to close down. Marion is full of despair as her dreams are shattered and she is essentially lonely leading her to begin doubting herself in her now secluded and helpless state.\n\tWim Wenders cinematography adds to the depth of the movie. As the point of view shifts throughout the movie, so does the variations of portions that are filmed in black and white. Angels, wishing they could experience life first hand, are portrayed to see life in black and white while they watch over the lives of humans. Humans on the other hand see life just as it is, full of color. The shifting between color and black and white aids in contrasting the differences in the conflicting views of humans and angels in the film. Wenders very boldly goes so far as to incorporate the point of view of children in the movie accompanied by the poem, \"Song of Childhood.\" This is plays a very significant role in the movie; shifting the main focus of the movie from the angles and their one dimensional point of view on life as they overlook humans (adults) to that of children. Unlike adults though, children don't exactly have a full understanding as to the meaning of life. The child in this scene questions who he is and why he isn't the other kid in front of him and wonders why is he even here. But despite that lack of understanding in their adolescence, children appreciate even the littlest of things in life and will more often than not try to get the most of their young lives which is something the adults in the movie and many people in today's society fail to do once reaching that certain point in life. \n\tWings of Desire turned out to be an exceptional film. The cinematography and realism throughout the film really made the movie. A lot of depth in the move is made up through the varying use of black and white and color filters. The black and white really brought out that one dimensional outlook on life as the angels would spectate the lives of the people of Berlin. Subsequently, a lesson on life can be learned by the end of this great film. Don't take life for granted, and appreciate the little things life has to offer.",

The director of this film wanted it to go more in depth. In order to do tha,t the movie has over ninety plus minutes of black and white commentary of the thoughts of everyday people. Through this, adds emphasis to what the angel's go through and observe, this portion of the movie is extremely dragged out. Most of the commentary is irrelevant to the plot of the movie, and it confuses the viewer as to what the story is. Even when one of the main character in the movie, the trapeze artist, appears the film continues to go off subject. This makes the viewer wonder what their main focus should be on.\n\tAs for the acting in the movie, this should be rated as decent. Decent in the sense that the parts in this film are relatively easy to portray. Majority of the characters in the film, are simply standard by passer, which can be played by anyone. As for the two main angels, their parts were played well enough, but even a majority of their character is emotionless. \nThe overall all look of the angels being dark and mysterious was chosen well in the appearance of the two men. The look for the main female actress was also matched well with the character being portrayed. She gives off a look of youth and innocence and when speaking her dialogue she does well in seducing the audience with her eyes and voice. The combination of her looks and the look of Damiel, is an awkward combination. His appearance being much older and more mature than hers, makes them an awkward pair for the audience to connect to.\n\tThe setting choice for the movie, works for and against it. Berlin being chosen as the city the story takes place, makes you wonder right off if the movie is based on what's going on at the time. Though that aspect adds more interest in the thoughts and emotions of the everyday people the angels observe, it only add to the confusion on what your focus should be on. If the German title for the movie \"The Skies of Heaven over Berlin\", would have been kept, the viewer would immediately think the movie had everything to do with what tragedy was taking place in Berlin at the time and would draw attention away from the actual plot of the movie.\n\tAnother major point of confusion in the movie is the question of who's, what? When the Damiel transitions into a human, we find out that the English actor Peter Fauc is also a former angel himself. We know this because he can sense their presence when the angels are around him. With that information, who's to say the main female actress is not former angel herself? There is no evidence in the film that says she not, but there is evidence that says she could be. For instance when she knew she was looking for a man but did not know who, and when she spoke alone in the movie it was as if she knows someone was listening. Same way Peter Fauc did when he sensed the presence of an angel around him. Also, towards the very end of the movie she knew exactly what man to go to in the bar, and her closing speech was implying she knew who he was all along and that they were going to meet? This is all evidence that supports that she could have also been a former angel herself, which leaves the viewer with even more confusion as to the characterization in the movie.\n\tThe overall rating for the movie Wings of Desire would be a three out of five stars. The acting and overall story of the movie is not a complete lost cause. The main downfall for the films is its pacing and pointless scenes, which leads to much confusion and loss of interest throughout the very beginning on.

            "content": "Wings of Desire is a movie that can be read on many different levels. Watching the film brings to the light events and themes that parallel our own experiences. The overall theme of the movie is to appreciate the little things in life. We take so much for granted that we often overlook the small details that someone else would kill to experience. If you're willing to read the sub-titles, this is actually a great movie.\nThis black and white film is based in a divided Germany. It is shown from the prospective of two angels, Damiel (Bruno Ganz) and Cassiel (Otto Sander. They have walked the earth for years observing human life. The angel Damiel wants to experience a human life. He longs for the warmth of coffee in his hands, time, colors, and ultimately love. They (angels) stand as a metaphor for an audience. They can see and observe what is happening and are able to give some humans relief from pain, but in the overall scheme of things, they do not have any real power over what happens in our day-to-day lives. Their presence can be felt by people, but they can only be seen by children. The children are able to see the angels because their [children] thoughts and minds are still pure.\n  \tThere are many different aspects that take part in the overall tone and perception of the movie. The movie in almost completely in German, so unless you're a fluent German speaker, the sub-titles might be your only way of enjoying the movie. Although the most of characters do not speak English, the movie is still worth the watch because of the interesting plot quality acting.\nThe colors and lighting has a huge effect on the movie. Because the movie is mostly through the eyes of the angels, the majority of it is in black and white; which causes the English sub-titles to be harder to read at times because they blend into the background. This allows the moments of color, as seen through the eyes of humans, to seem more vivid and causes a bigger impact on the plot of the story. The lighting does have some scenes where the shades are lighter (like in the circus) to give a feeling of how the mood of the actors and environment is light and emotion is high.\nOther significant parts to the movie would be the actors and the dialogue. The actors bring their characters to life in the film. Their subtle dialogue often includes sayings and quotes that make you think about life. Quotes like, \"Isn't life under the sun just a dream?\" or \"I want to die, and live forever,\" causes the audience to connect and empathize with the characters as they reflect on what they just heard. There are times when character have a small soliloquy used to make the audience really relate the movie to their own lives. Marion (the trapeze artist) makes a direct point to everyone watching in her last speech that ends in, \"Now... it's your turn. You hold the game in your hand. Now... or never.\" She is telling everyone that we have the power, and that we should no longer strive to only exist; but rather, we should live our lives to the fullest. The poem \"Song of Childhood\" by Peter Handke is constantly referenced throughout the movie. Its overall message talks about how in life, things tend to stay the same; but as we grow older, our perspective changes.\nThe point of view and camera angles also add dramatic effect. There are a lot of close-up shots on the person who is speaking. This allows the audience to focus on and empathize more with the character who is speaking. When the camera zooms into Damiel, at times, it is a little unsettling because it jumps right to a blank stare on his face, but it grabs the audience's attention. The camera also pans when showing the angels walking through the snow. It adds dramatic effect as it shifts the background depending of the mood of the characters in the film.\nOverall, the themes, plot, and message of the movie was enjoyable. It may have been portrayed in a slightly dull way, but once you actually get into the movie you begin to enjoy it. A quote that helps best describe the plot of this movie would be, \"It is not about the number of breaths you take. But about the moments that take your breath away.\"",

            "content": "The movie \"Wings of Desire\" presents an eye opening vision through the point of view of the supernatural that makes you appreciate what you have in life. What an angel would sacrifice to enjoy the small things we take for granted every day of our lives is nearly ungraspable. As meaningful as this movie was it still could have been better in several ways.\n\tThe overall video quality of the movie was fairly good judging that it was released in the eighties. The movie quality is better in some areas of the film than others in some cases. The scenes that were in color appeared more crisp and defined versus the scenes that were in black and white. The movie would have been a lot cleaner looking if it was in color but that would ruin the purpose of the black and white footage, which is linked to the angels because they cannot see color. All of the camera angles and shots were great with absolutely no shaking. \n\tThe performance of the actors showed that they had practiced their roles quite well. The overall attitude and expression of the main characters in \"Wings of Desire\" made the film feel genuine and well made. The way the circus ran around performing an amateur act showed that the actors in the film were good enough at acting that they could purposely put on an unprofessional show giving the small circus scenes a feeling of authenticity. The dialogue of the actors also presented a great deal of professionalism. They knew how to set the tones of their voices well enough to match the overall atmosphere of what was currently taking place. Though the dialogue was great, a large portion of it was compiled of thoughts from several people. There should have been more spoken dialogue between people instead all of the mind reading done by the angels. When they read the thoughts of people they tend to just sit there expressionless for the most part showing no real effort of acting, which makes the scenes less enjoyable. \n\tOne of the biggest faults of this movie in particular is how difficult it is to understand. At the beginning of the movie there is no introduction to what is taking place, it only shows shots of people that we do not know the names of that are not relevant to the rest of the movie thinking thoughts about their life or just general topics. These people, and mostly everyone else in the movies, speak in a manner in which is not easily understood. Everyone's thought dialogue is spoken as if they were poets from the nineteenth century. Things like this are major drawbacks for younger generations who are viewing this movie. Most of the movie is in German as well making it even more challenging to enjoy the movie because you are forced to read along instead of just watching and listening. \nThe movie is also very slow paced and extremely hard to get into. For the most part the \"Wings of Desire\" is very uneventful leaving you feeling desperate for something exciting to happen. The only thing that holds this movie together is its beautiful story about an angel who wants to feel, see, and to taste what is like to be human as well as to get together with a girl he has feelings for who is human. It is very heart warming to see this aspect of the movie past all of the boring dialogue. Unfortunately the climax of the movie was short lived when the story finally picks up.\nOverall \"Wings of Desire\" is a good movie for its purpose, which teaches us to enjoy the little things in life, and for its story. It is not very interesting to watch until later in the film when he decides to take the fall and become human, but if you can hold on until then you may like it. If you wish to enjoy this movie it requires an open mind, a lot of patience, and perhaps a degree in literature.",

            "content": "Wim Wenders' film, \"Wings of Desire\" is a German tale portraying the story of angels who inhabit the city of Berlin. The angels depicted in the film are representatives of God that wonder about watching and listening to the thoughts of those who accompany them. Furthermore, these angels offer a small sense of comfort to those in distress and overtaken by the struggles of the natural world. \n\t\"Wing's of Desire\" begins with a poem about the innocence of childhood children. The poem's inclusion helps to develop the underlying message of the work.  The poem's constant reflection of when a child was a child and how everything was viewed differently coincides with the idea that the author wants his audience to understand the importance of life and how they must appreciate the small things just like when they were a child. \nDamiel and Cassiel are the two main characters in the movie. The two angels roam about Berlin witnessing the way the people go about their daily lives unseen by those surrounding them except children. The movie's depiction of black and white graphics demonstrates the unforeseen antics of the angels as they guide the citizens through life. The author does an extraordinary job presenting what the angels see compared to the Berlin residents through the color scheme of the film. At some point in the movie Damiel falls madly in love with a woman. His love and desire to be with her pushes him closer to become human like until eventually, he has his transformation. The author then transitions from the black and white scenes to vivid color scenes. These transitions help implicate the idea that often people are suppressed by the cold-hearted burdens of things that do not have any true value in life. Instead they must step back and enjoy the simple things that the world has given to them. \nThe genre of the movie also contributes to the overall meaning of the movie. \"Wings of Desire\" can be classified as a romantic film. Damiel's main reason of desire to become human was so he could share his love for Marion with her. The dramatization throughout the movie made it evident that Damiel longed to be that one person to fill the void in Marion's life and to be able to ease her pain. Once Damiel finally achieves his goal of becoming human, the movie takes on the role of a well-developed fairy tale. The angel, who once was only able to witness the daunting emotions of the people around him and see the world only through the gray scale appearance he was allowed to, now was able to experience all of nature's true beauty and its simplicities. \nAt this point of the movie, the poem from the beginning of the work plays a significant role as it reiterates the simple things in life. After becoming human Damiel recognizes all the little things in life and tries to cherish them to the best of his ability. This notion is seen when the fresh, red blood that is covering him, along with the vibrant scenes painted along the Berlin wall amuses Damiel. Moreover, he refers back to the poem as he recite the lines, \"when a child was a child...\" Looking back on childhood, the audience is able to see how children cherish the small entities in life more and ponder on certain aspects questioning why certain things are the way they are. \nIn conclusion, \"Wings of Desire\" is an exemplary film demonstrating those who have the ability to observe the world that has been created, yet unable to change anything about it. Its powerful plot lures the audience into a meditative state and helps give them a new insight on life.   Furthermore, Wenders' movie acknowledges those mundane privileges in life that many take for granted and encourages us to embrace those moments before it becomes too late.",

            "content": "Eleanor Roosevelt once said \"The purpose of life to live it, taste it, and experience it to the utmost to reach out eagerly and without fear for never and richer experience.\" This quotes closely relates to the theme of the Franco- German romantic film, Wings of Desire. Wings of Desire was directed by Wim Wenders and is considered by  many a great movie. This film received many awards and I see why. Some of those awards were Best Director Award, Independent Spirit Award for Best Foreign Film , National Society of Film Critics Award, and Best Cinematography for a German Film.\n This romantic film closely shadows the lives of two angels Damiel, who is played by Bruno Ganz and Cassiel, who is played by Otto Sanders. These two angels  wander around the area of West Berlin and try to console the people of this town. Overall this movie to me is quite good. This movie tells a beautiful tale of love and shows and appreciation of life and time. \nThe theme of this movie is learning to appreciate life and how awesome life is. \nThe director intends for the viewer to take from this film live your life while you're living because one day you will not be able to and you can not get back those days so take advantage of them while they are yours. Damiel who was once an angel craves to be a human after falling in love with a woman. Thankfully in the end he gets the chance to be human again and he and the woman fall deeply in love.\n\tHowever, there were some parts of the movie that didn't really hold me and manipulated my brain to believe this movie was quite boring, which is not the case. The beginning of this movie had a very slow start, which I helped developed the mood for the audience. Most negative reviewers of this movie might be used to American films where things start fast and they get to the point. I felt this movie needed the slow developed and would have lost its touch without the slow beginning. The pace of this movie really relates to patience angels have.\n\tParts of the movie that did bore me was the constant walking around. The angels walked around and just looked and heard the thoughts of others and touched them. That does follow my idea of an angel, but I wish the angels were more distinguished. The angels in this movie wore clothes just like humans of this time. The fact that angel wanted to be human was at first a surprise but I realized that angels can only watch humans live life and I could see where the jealousy would eventually build up. \n\tThe other part of the movie I didn't like was the cinematography. The movie was mostly black and white, which I didn't like. However, it had its moments of color when focusing in on a human. This idea was quite clever in a way if you think of it as the angels had the dull boring lives and hovered over human never able to grasp their feeling of life. While the humans had this vibrant life and could feel the wind in their hair and come home from a long day of work, kick their shoes off and wiggle their toes and relax. \n\tEven with this movie's few flaws in my opinion the movie still did a good job of  portraying the dull lives of the angels Damiel and Cassiel. I'd give this movie 4 out of 5 stars.",

            "content": "Director Wim Wenders's description of an angel may differ from our description of an angel in the fantasy film Wings of Desire. After all lonely, sad, long-haired men in big overcoats do not really form a picture of an angel in one's mind. In the early parts of the film, we encounter a world of invisible angels who seem to be on the lookout for humans in pain and agony in the city of Berlin. We follow two members of this angel society in particular Damiel played brilliantly by Bruno Marz and Cassiel also played brilliantly by Otto Sander. These angels ride the subway and listen to the travelers thought, try to soothe a pregnant lady, go to a library or even caress an injured man's head. However, they cannot change the upcoming event or situation. Despite the actors' fine acting, the beginning gets a little confusing at times perhaps for the fact that there were too many thoughts going on. The setting of the city of Berlin throughout the movie was a major part of the film. Berlin being the depressed city scarred deeply by its past provides the perfect setting for that human suffering element of the movie.\nThe film takes a turn when Bruno meets a lonely trapeze artist, Marion (Solveig Dommartin), and becomes infatuated to her. Here starts his desire to leave the wings of an angel and become human. Every time Damiel sees her one can see the subtle changes on his face for the passion and longing of Marion's love. This is not something typical for an angel to feel since he has already seen everything. Solveig Dommatin's acting is satisfactory but her dialogue delivery does not t match up to Ganz's strong monologues. However, she did all her acrobatic stunts herself by learning them in just eight weeks which is commendable. Peter Falk(as himself) has an important role as a formal angel. He changes the mood of the movie by adding a little comic relief throughout the bits of the movie. \nThe cinematography is amazing with way the movie changes from plain black and white to expressive colors as the point of view changes from an Angel's to Human. The helicopter shots of the city symbolize the way that the angels watch over Berlin. Much of the dialogue in the film is internal monologue and the person's thoughts. Rightly so, not much dialogue is needed because the strong performances of the actors convey the pain and understanding of the character they are portraying. Jurgen Knieper does a remarkable job of illustrating that dark, mysterious and magical aura surrounding the angels thorough the music. However, at times it gets too loud that it becomes challenging to hear the dialogue in the movie. \nAlthough Wender's style of directing is great, it felt that sometimes the movie lost track of where it was going, especially towards the end. The pacing of the film is awfully slow yet the end seemed too rushed. It sort of loses its balance towards the end. In the last scene, it almost feels like Wender's did not know what he was trying to do. Nevertheless, the camera angels in that particular scene make a very personal connection with the audience and that was quite an incredible way to end the movie. Overall, Wings of desire is not your typical entertainment film that lays the whole story out on a screen. Wings of Desire has some complex, poetic and philosophical views on life that make one think. So if you do not like the exercise of thinking while watch a movie, it is suggested you do not go see this one because you will easily be bored.",

            "content": "Wings of Desire is a brilliant movie. At first it can be slightly confusing if you are watching without any prior knowledge of what will be happening. It is full of symbolism and poetry. It is also in another language so most of the movie you will spend time reading the subtitles. Which is a big downfall because the cinematography mixed with the music makes you want to watch the movie fully. As a whole Wings of Desire makes you think. You slowly start to understand what everything means throughout the movie which makes you think even more. You start to realize how the poetry connects with the movie. It slowly but surely helps you realize what a meaningful life is all about.  \nYou will quickly learn watching this film that it is mainly about two angels, Damiel and Cassiel. They are two angels who have been watching over the city of Berlin since the beginning of time.  They travel through all of Berlin helping those who are either hurt or in need. However, one of the angels has grown tired of doing this and wants to give up his immortality to be human. This angel would be Damiel, played by Bruno Ganz. He spends his days either helping people realize how great life is and that they need to live it to the fullest; or he would spend his days watching people having fun, living through every moment. He longs for these feelings, which is how he finds the love of his life a lonely trapeze artist named Marion. \nMarion is a lonely woman who is great at the trapeze. This character is played by Sloveig Dommartin. Who is a mediocre actress but did wonderful at performing all of her own stunts. Marion's love is the trapeze and she is only truly happy when she gets to perform. This love however does not satisfy Marion fully. She wants to find someone to love. Damiel understands how lonely a person can be since he can't talk to anyone except for his companion Cassiel. All he can do is listen to others thoughts but not talk to them about their thoughts. So he longs to be human not only to speak to others but so that he can have a chance to be with Marion. \nThis film is not only about Damiel wanting to be human it is also about him and Cassiel (Otto Sander) helping others. They both help numerous people throughout this film. They help people who have been hurt and people who are down and out about their lives and want it to end. However, Cassiel does not save one person and it affects him deeply. Damiel does not want to deal with the constant helping of others any longer and seeks to be human. All he wants to do is live life to the fullest but he cannot in the lackluster angel world he lives in. He feels nothing in the angel world and wants to know what pain and happiness feels like. \nIn his pursuit to belong to the human world he starts to follow Der Filmstar who is played by Peter Falk. Who is a wonderful actor in every single scene he is present. Der Filmstar senses when Damiel is around which intrigues him to come around more often. Der Filmstar keeps telling him to come to the human world. He tells him he would love to meet Damiel in person. So naturally this makes Damiel want to come to the human world even more. Throughout the movie Cassiel tries to convince Damiel to stay an angel. Damiel is torn and does not know what to do. Eventually he makes his decision and does not regret it. \nIn my opinion this movie is splendidly put together. The aerial views and shots done throughout Wings of Desire were well thought out. You can definitely can tell the symbolism between the human and the angel worlds. The poem tied into all the symbolism and really shows you that a child's mind is one we all strive to keep. However, reading the subtitles tends to get aggravating because you can't fully watch the movie. At times Wings of Desire can move very slowly without any dialogue happening. Which makes it hard to watch but the music keeps you focused. The music played throughout the movie was accurate to every scene. In a way the music kept the movie going at certain parts and helped you learn when and where the angels were at or were going. Overall it is an intriguing movie to watch and I would highly suggest it to others.",

            "content": "The movie Wings of Desire is a dull movie that starts out with two men who have a very strange in manner looking down at a city. They watch as people pass and children play. They are unnoticed but somehow the children can see them. These men wonder around the city of Berlin, Germany. They walk up to people and attempt to comfort them. Hey can hear what the people around them are thinking. At first it is not clear what they are doing and there is nothing that is helpful in understanding it. The movie drags on like this, going from a man sitting on a street corner to people reading in a library. It is not until later when a trapeze artist wearing angel wings is shown. This then implants the idea that the two men are angels wondering around the city listening to the thoughts of people that interest them. One of the angels seems to fall in love with the lonely trapeze artist and the film turns into color. This transition shows the human emotion in the angel. The angel has a great desire to be human.\nWings of Desire is roughly a two hour movie that fails to capture the attention of the audience. It is a long, drawn out and it seems to be going nowhere and that there is nowhere to go. It is almost like an astronaut that got separated from his ship and is at a drift with no destination knowing his oxygen will not last long. Wings of Desire was directed by Wim Wenders and was released in 1987. Although I give this movie a two out of five star rating it did win many awards. Some of these consisted of Best Director Award, Independent Spirit Award for Best Foreign Film, and National Society of Film Critics Award. I do not understand how this film received so many awards. But it may just be the culture in time frame that I grew up in.",

            "content": "As Peter Falk says in Wings of Desire, \"There's so many good things,\" and undoubtedly, one of the good things about this movie is feeling alive. This 1987 film stars Bruno Ganz, Otto Sander, Peter Falk, and Solveg Dommartin. Wings of Desire was directed by Wim Wenders and is critically acclaimed by several media outlets. In the beginning, the camera pans over post-World War II Berlin in its entirety. The Berlin Wall stands out and provides background scenery for many of the scenes. The whole concept of the film is that angels watch over and comfort human beings during the most difficult moments of their days. Adults generally cannot see the angels, but some children can; others much like Peter Falk's character can feel their presence and will speak directly to them. Wings of Desire is considered the classic film that it is because of its use of dialogue, portrayal of perspective, and its underlying message.\n\tDialogue in a movie such as Wings of Desire is crucial. An important aspect of the film is the angels listening to the thoughts of humans and the dialogue provides a poetic outlet for the actors. The dialogue relays the entire concept of the movie which is mostly told through a conversation between the two main angels: Damiel (Bruno Ganz) and Cassiel (Otto Sander). Despite the fact that this movie is considered \"fantasy,\" the dialogue genuinely displays the reality of the movie whether it is when the audience hears a suicidal man's thoughts or the loving thoughts that Damiel feels for his human love, Marion (played by Solveg Dommartin). The \fdialogue of this film does an outstanding job of telling the story and perspectives of its characters. \n\tPerspective can be shown in various ways, but Wings of Desire utilizes unique methods that many films lack. An interesting way that perspective was shown in this film was through languages. Most characters such as Damiel, Cassiel, and nearly all of the background voices spoke German, but Marion spoke French and Peter Falk spoke English. The usage of several languages is important to the characters and their plot lines. The constantly changing perspectives/voices speaking also gives the audience exposure to many different cultures and languages. The best way that the film shows perspective is through its divine cinematography. The cinematographer of the film did a magnificent job of showing most scenes in black and white, but very few and very significant scenes in color. The black and white scenes are meant to show the perspective of the angels. Some claim that Wenders' goal was to show the angels' point of view in black and white because it is like they are watching a black and white movie; they cannot change what is in front of them, but they can watch and hope for the best. This is an allusion to the idea that the angels are exactly like the audience. Though the cinematography has hidden gems, the most important underlying meanings are in the message of Wings of Desire. \n\tClearly, Wings of Desire is a complex film with many underlying meanings and messages. The main message that audiences are supposed to take from this movie is to be grateful. It is widely believed that Wim Wenders' goal with this film was to make people think and contemplate. Damiel desires humanity for so long while so many humans tend to take their humanity for granted. Wings of Desire really reminds its audience of how amazing it is to be alive. Humanity is a gift and most people live their lives and forget the fact that it could be taken from them at any moment.\n\tThis film exemplifies not only its intended time period adequately, but also a concept that may have been considered risky for a movie during its release. Personally, this film was a joy to witness because it kept audiences' attention with its imagery. Wings of Desire portrays all of the good things in life including beautiful words through its dialogue, various perspectives through characters and cinematography, and an important life lesson.",

            "content": "There is nothing more intriguing than a story of romance, sadness, and the fragility of time, with all three happening at once. If you can get past the German and pay close attention to the subtitles, Wings of Desire is a must-see movie. It consists of two angels who are not haunted by time, but by eternity. These angels go through town unable to participate in the everyday life of humans, but they are able to hear the thoughts of sadness, worry, and stress of the people around them. Occasionally they will go to someone who is troubled and make them think a little clearer, although some can't seem to be helped. The movie was set in 1987 in Berlin during a very rough time when the Berlin Wall was still present. The Berlin Wall is shown in the movie multiple times, and it is used to imply that even though the cities are split, the sky where the angels are is not. The sky is the only thing that connects us to the rest of the world and it cannot be divided. \nThe movie was directed by Wim Wenders. The cast includes Bruno Ganz, who plays Damiel, one of the two angels that wanders throughout the city and wishes constantly that he was human. The second angel, Cassiel, played by Otto Sander, is a little more comfortable about the idea of remaining an angel and is not as persistent as Damiel about experiencing mortal life. The major reason Damiel wants to become human, in my opinion, is to be with Marion, an extremely lonely trapeze artist that he is in love with. Marion is played by Solveig Dommartin. Although Marion cannot see him physically, she longs to find the man that she sees in her dreams; Damiel. When she first sees him in person, once he becomes human and finds her in a bar, she spills her heart out to him about how she finally found the one she has been missing and that she wants things to now become serious. She also says that she finally has a story, and encourages that others should create a story for themselves as well.  \nOne main characteristic of this movie that makes it stand out amongst others is how the majority is in black and white, but occasionally it will switch to color to show only the human world. This is important in the movie because without it, it would be easy to get confused about whose point of view is being expressed and who the audience is supposed to be focusing on. Another major aspect is how the cameras zoom in closely on a character's face while he/she is talking. This is meant to imply that the character in the movie is speaking directly to the audience. This gives a more personal feel to the movie, as though the director wanted you to leave the theater with a changed perspective on life. Throughout the movie, a poem called \"Song of Childhood\" is being read in the background. This poem is a very important to the theme of the movie because it expresses that people should appreciate the little things in life, as children do. The poem says that when we are young, we are hopeful, innocent, and curious about the way life works. We possess no habits and we take life one day at a time. As we age, we still possess the same likes and dislikes that we had as a child, but we are not as hopeful and appreciative of the world. We just follow routine and the world is only a place where we live and where we occupy space. It is no longer a place of curiosity, just a place of habit. The dying man in the movie, who was in a motorcycle accident, is sitting on the side of the road thinking about everything he should've done but probably won't get the chance to. Once Damiel approaches him and puts a hand on him, he starts thinking about the little things in life like the sun, the first drops of rain, and the horizon. The angels encourage others to be more appreciative and more present in the world, because that is what they long for but cannot do as angels. The story-teller, played by Curt Bois, is a poet who appears occasionally in the movie and talks about how he wants things back to their original way, when people were curious and they wanted to hear stories. He says that people will come looking for him because they need him more than ever. People need a story because without your story, who are you? The story-teller dreams of an \"epic of peace\", which is exactly what Wings of Desire is. This movie has won a well-deserved award for Best Director in 1987 at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival, and the Grand Prix award in 1988 from the Belgian Film Critics Association.",

            "content": "By human nature, we tend to not like something because we don't understand it. With a movie in different languages, someone may not fully understand the plot. The movie takes place in West Berlin, Germany in 1987. The time the movie is taking place allows for a much simpler storyline without the distractions we face every day. The actors  Win Wenders did a great job directing this movie. The movie is so much more authentic if you have the translated subtitles instead of watching a dubbed version. A dubbed movie is when the movie is voiced over in English. Dubbed versions of movies don't give the same effect as an original movie with subtitles. The word choice is makes a huge difference when parts of the movie are worded different to have them be proper sentences in another language.\n\tWhen a movie is translated to another language, the word choice isn't as precise and it could convey a different message. Having some details not blatantly obvious forces the viewer to really focus on what is going on in the movie. It is really hard to decipher what is going on in this movie at first. The movie is really confusing when you can't understand what the characters are saying and you have no pre developed idea of what is going to happen. There are a few ways to give settle hints that something is important to the plot, the color changes from black to white, zooming in on something, or even showing somebody's eyes. A few times in the movie, the color changes to show you are seeing something from an angel's perspective or the people who are still living. The change in color was a great indicator that the point of view in the movie had changed. Body movement is also very important when trying to comprehend a movie's plot. When an angel touches somebody it is very easy to tell the person can feel they are being protected, they seem to relax and can sense someone is there but don't look directly at the person right next to them. \nAlthough a person could never talk to an angel, and an angel could never come back to life, the movie does take place in real places. Damiel (Bruno Ganz) wants so bad to be able to touch like a human can. He gives up his immortality to experience life. He is amazed by all the little things in life we wouldn't think twice about. Another angel, Cassie (Otto Sander) tries to save somebody who has given up, but fails and can't get the experience out of his head. \nSolveig Dommartin was a French acrobat in the movie and she did all of her stunts in the movie herself, without a safety net. This shows true dedication on her part. After following her for a period of time, Damiel gives up his immortality to pursue his love for her.  The poem repeated in the movie is called \"Song of Childhood\". The poem is generally about how the children can see angels but adults can't. This is mostly accounted to the fact that young kids still have their imagination and have been spoiled by society. The appreciation of life is evident throughout most of the movie. Some of the things Damiel was most impressed by are things we take advantage of each day. Watching how happy all this makes him shows the audience what is truly important. Things like seeing color or smelling flowers, are examples of sense we don't think much about. They are just a normal part of life. Little things that someone gave up immortality to experience. The color changes in the movie are used to show the perspective has changed but it felt like it also brightened the mood. \nI think this is a great culturally diverse movie. The directing and concept behind the movie are what make it so much different. Even though I only understood the French and English parts of the movie, I admire all time and effort that went into making this movie.",

            "content": "As adults grow out of childhood, their appreciation of life slowly starts to dwindle away. In the film, Wings of Desire, this loss of appreciation of human aspects in life is portrayed through the experience of Damiel, an angel in Berlin, who longs to become human and experience what it's like to see in color, to taste, to feel, to live in time, and to love.  Most of the film is from the perspective of Damiel, which gives the audience a glimpse into the life of an angel. The dreariness of the picture in black and white, the sound of human thoughts, and the feeling of total disregard of human beings around contribute to the feeling of disconnection of life. Through Damiel's desire to become human, the film does an impressive job of showing the importance of simple life aspects that humans take for granted.  \n\tThe cinematography in Wings of Desire contributes well to the mood of the film. Because the film is shot through the eyes of Damiel, the audience is given a perspective of life without human aspects. The black and white filter throughout the movie creates a dreary feeling that captures what life is like without the sense of color sight. Once Damiel becomes human, he gains the human senses and the picture turns to color. Almost immediately, the film seems to become happier which gives the audience a realization of how fortunate we are to have the ability to see colors. \nThe pacing in the film is especially slow but does a great job of giving the audience a feeling of life without time. Damiel says to Cassiel, the other angel in the film, how he longs to experience time, which seems very trivial, but as the film goes on, this gives audience a perspective of life without time. The way humans all around are not aware of the angels' presence, gives the audience the feeling of uselessness and disconnection to life. The only people who are able to recognize the presence of the angels are the children. This shows how children are the only ones capable of appreciation of all aspects of life. They are still aware and amazed by even the small things without which life would have no meaning. \nThe actors in the film do a great job of showing the innocence of children and the dullness of adulthood. The adults in the film are shown with somber faces, gloomy lives, and seem to be preoccupied with shallow thoughts while the children are always shown laughing, playing, and exploring the city with friends. It seems as if the adults are unhappy and just trying to get through life but the children are enjoying life all around them. During the scene at the circus, the children's faces light up in amazement for each act. This shows just how much children truly appreciate life for what it is. \nI feel the film Wings of Desire, was an excellent portrayal of an angel's passive life. Damiel's desire to become human and experience life almost seems ridiculous in the beginning of the film. As humans, we take our life and everything that comes with it for granted. In Damiel's experience, he longed for things we sometimes see as trivial such as taste. The film definitely captured what life would be like without actively living. From an angel's perspective, they just sit around and watch life go by without being a part of it. The film showed how adults don't take the time to slow down in life and appreciate the small things we are given. The way in which the film was produced without color, any perception of time, and the voices of thoughts all around really gave the audience an inside perspective of what life is like without really being present in it. The children in the film were a great metaphor. Their innocence, awe, and appreciation of even simple things show the audience just how precious life is. The plot, cinematography, acting, perspective of the angel, and pacing of the film works well together to show the dreariness of \"life\" without human aspects and without actively living.",

            "content": "The movie, Wings of Desire, was a very interesting movie, that portrayed different abstract ideas, along with a very good story. This movie was portrayed very differently from other movies of its time period, maybe since it was filmed in Germany which is a different culture from American culture. There are certain aspects about this movie that are different, some in good ways others in bad ways, but from things like how it was filmed in black and white, or how the way they structured the flow of the movie. Though this movie is quite different from other movies, but it is a very very good movie and would make my list of top ten movies. \nOne thing that I really liked about this movie was the way it was filmed. Even though it was filmed in black and white and would occasionally switch to color, I really enjoyed the concept behind it saying that that when it was filmed in black and white was when you were viewing life through the angles and when it was in color you were watching the movie through people. Another thing is that it seemed it was filmed with aerial shots over Berlin, to me this was implying that this mean the angels were watching over us. In general the camera work seemed to well enough, their was not any crazy explosions or CGI, it just seemed it was very simple but it does not hurt the movie in any way. \nWings of Desire was mainly filmed in German with only one character who spoke English, so the acting was not affected for its very hard to tell good or bad acting without knowing the language since you can read so much from different tones and body language. The fact that it was written in German may bother the viewer, but if someone does not like to read then they will not like it. The story of the movie was very good, but it really wasn't anything special it just seemed like your average story without any major plot twists or anything like that. The flow of the movie moves very fast were you really have to pay attention to subtle details and hints. Some may say that it may be a little hard to follow because of it moving so fast on top of it being in German, but if you are able to follow it then it truly is a great movie. \nOne thing that Wings of Desire did a great job of is that it had allot of interesting concepts and ideas mainly including metaphors and symbolism. For example in the movie it showed how the angles would read peoples minds and it would go from person to person each one thinking out loud, most of them talking about their problems through day to day life. With this you can say that you are not the only one who has problems, everyone does and it may seem like their lives are perfect from the outside but in reality they aren't. It also showed us how even though we may have are problems it seems that their is something that is always helping us, something that we do not know about guiding us and helping us through our day to day life. One message that this movie sends out is that in order to find happiness you must appreciate the smaller things in life, one way it showed this was they showed a group of people who looked to be poor with nothing, but they were sitting around a fire laughing and joking implying that they were truly happy even though they had nothing. \nWings of Desire demonstrated allot of aspects of a great movie with its fantastic camera work to it deeper messages within that you have to uncover yourself. One thing this movie does is that it was simple, it did not have fancy explosions or action scenes to try and keep you hooked, it was able to do this by just simply being a good movie which is what in my opinion a movie should do. It has allot of aspects that demonstrate it to being a great movie and I would highly recommend this movie to many people if they wanted to watch what a movie should truly be.",

            "content": "The snooze fest of Wings of Desire is a grueling two hours to try to stay awake to, due to the unclear story and crawling plot development. From the very beginning, you are thrown into a movie that already seemed knee deep in a storyline. You sit there struggling to understand the progression of a movie that is built off the thoughts of an angel. Majority of the movie is spent observing an angel observe all of Berlin, silently narrating the course of random events. With little to no interaction between characters, the only exception being Columbo, the quiet observations give way only for rare moments of comic relief.\n \tThe confusing story, that follows the thoughts of Damiel, the angel protagonist, takes place following random people in Berlin up until the angel stumbles upon the circus. The setting and the characters in it have very little meaning, and the plot of the story would have been unaffected if the exposition had begun with the acrobat. Pointless scenes like the library, the rooftop, and the train where Damiel merely walks around, listening to the thoughts of the people, and then moves on to the next person only complicates the purpose of the movie and leaves the audience scratching their head as they attempt to untangle the puzzle that is the meaning of the film.\n\tThe slow, monotone, narrating voice that fills the silence steadily lolls you to sleep as you read the subtitles, which is the only indication to the direction of the movie. Even then, there may be no directions from the spoken narration. Such as the old poet, Homer, in the library, the old man recites poetry. This leaves the audience bewildered as to the significance of the poem and how it propels the plot forward in the story. Also, the suicide scene, the narration is a montage of random thoughts that seem to lead to nowhere, and while the audience is trying to solve the riddle of the thoughts, the man jumps and we are left baffled as to what happened.\n\tThen there are moment when there are no words. For instance, when Damiel follows Marion into the underground concert featuring Crime and the City Solution, the whole scene is merely Damiel watching Marion dance and clips of Crime and the City Solutions. The time spent watching the dancing and concert adds what feels like hours to an already slow film. The film could have spent thirty to forty-five seconds on the scene and the time watching the scene would have felt much more appropriate for the importance of the scene, instead of the four and a half minutes.\n \tAs an average movie goer, this film was very complicated to sit through and comprehend. Many would argue that this film is thought provoking and stimulates a feeling of appreciation for life, but this could be said about Winnie the Pooh. While this movie has a lot of meaning and has received great claim as an art film, to the average viewer not interested in abstract movies, such as Wings of Desire, this movie will bore you to tears.",

Bruno Ganz is his usual self in it; sublime. I strongly believe that he is one of the greatest actors on the planet. I cannot begin to describe the beauty and poeticism of the premise of an Angel wanting to lose his wings just so he can live a normal life and know what it is like to come home and feed the cat, have his fingers turn black from the newspaper, say \"ah\" \"oh\" and \"ouch\" instead of \"yes\" and \"amen,\" to lie through one's teeth, and to love another person and have them know you actually exist. It's perfect. The use of black and white for the Angel's perspective and color for human perspective is absolutely genius. Seriously if you have even the chance to see this film do NOT hesitate; just see it and marvel at it's wonder. I love this film. 5 stars.",

It follows two angels who have been studying humans for eternity, and sharing notes on our thoughts and actions.  They question why it is we laugh and live the way we do.  This continues until one of the angels falls in love with a beautiful circus performer.  He is torn over his longing until he meets Peter Falk who plays as himself, and Peter convinces him to \"fall\" to the Earth and find the woman he loves.  Simply an artistic masterpiece by the irrepressible Wim Wenders.",

            "content": "Before Bruno Ganz was Hitler, he was an angel, so I think that it's safe to say that he is a very diverse actor. Still, he's not the most diverse actor in the world, because he just can't get enough of being in full-on German films, even though he's Swiss, with a northern Italian mother. Yes, I'm well aware that Swiss borders on Germany, so it's pretty tight with the German culture, but really, Ganz wishes that he was born on the other side of that border, because he's a bit too celebratory of his culture's rather similar neighbor. Well, the German films he's in are the only ones that people remember, and plus, his name is Bruno Ganz, which is so German that it's not even Swiss anymore, so it's pretty clear that he was born to be a little bit more German than the average Swiss. Well, now that I think about it, maybe he's not so much a fan of Germany, as much as he's a fan of short drives - seeing as how this film is German and French, two cultures that are pretty much right there next to Switzerland -, but either way, it would appear as though Ganz is a good casting choice for this film, because he, much like the angel he portrays, is in a culture that looms over Germany, though isn't quite German, no matter how much he wishes he was. Well, either the Damiel character wants to be German or is upset about the harsh realities of life... or wants a sandwhich; it's kind of hard to keep up with subtitles sometimes. Hey, I may be rusty on my German... French, Turkish, Hebrew and Spanish (Thank goodness this film also has English segments, or else my head probably would have exploded), but I know a good film when I see it, and let me tell, this one, well, isn't even close, as it is a tremendous mess, yet one saved by what is good in this film, which may not be much, but is decidedly enough to save these wings from getting clipped (Whatever that's supposed to mean).\r\n\r\nHenri Alekan's cinematography has been praised as brilliant, and, of course, it really isn't all that good, largely because the artistry within the photography goes drowned out by the mostly black-and-white style. However, black-and-white or not, there's a consistent level of attractiveness in Alekan's photography, and much of it comes from quite a few slickly clever tracking shots that catch your eye and give you a dazzling view of the environment, which is something to be said about the few occasions in which the photography does don color, and handsome color at that. Outside of Alekan, the other man who breathes essence into this film and gives you a certain degree of feel for the environment is, of course, leading man Bruno Ganz, who has very little to do, being asked to do not much more than be fascinated, awed and often disturbed by the human world, but boy, does Ganz know how to do that. The Damiel character's visit of the mortal world gives him profound insight into the hearts, minds and souls of humanity, and Ganz conveys this poignantly and with quite a few layers, capturing the wonderment, sympathy, affections, fear and anguish of a spirit who uncovers the depths of a world and finds both the very good and the extremely bad. Alkan's and Ganz's artistic efforts are held back, but impressive enough to sustain your attention, to a certain degree, while director, co-director and co-writer Wim Wenders makes his ambitions palpable, and respectably so, thus creating a sense of charm that's not especially intense, but does go quite a ways in the long run. As I'll get into later, this charm often descends into a bit of arrogance, but on the whole, Wenders' ambitions are commendable, and fulfilled just enough to save this film. However, for every fulfilled ambition, there are every so many that go unfulfilled, and quite considerably, for although the film never collapses under the overwheming weight of its mistakes, it still makes so many mistakes, and just enough for it to fall as unrewarding, or if nothing else, blandness incarnated.\r\n\r\nOkay, maybe the film isn't exactly blandness incarnated, or even quite as boring as I was expecting, yet make no mistake, it is dull, as you would expect a meditative film to be, and woah boy, is this film very much a meditative film. The fact of the matter is that the film has nearly no plot and is primarily looking to analyze humanity with style and lyricism, which is respectable and all, but ever so rarely works, and sure as sunshine doesn't work here, as the film is too plotless and too lyrical, heavily meditating upon nothing but nothing for excessively long periods of time, thus leaving the film's artistry to overbear considerably, which is a situation made worse by the histrionic voice-overs, superfluous on-the-spot dialogue pieces and music that amplify the film's overbearing artistry. It doesn't take long for this type of meditative storytelling's effectiveness to run thin, and it all but takes over most of the film, and after a while of this, the artistry doesn't simply dull the film down, but drenches it in pretense, as well as a lack of focus that leaves substance to dilute, thus betraying the film's intentions. These overlong moments of meditativeness certainly add a degree of unevenness in the film once traditional storytelling falls into play, at which point, you're jarred into a different storytelling method so messily that you hardly even notice the transition, thus leaving the ever so few moments of plot - such as it is - to fall flat. Still, where we're dealing with too much artistry or following an messily handled \"plot\", there is a consistent element throughout this film, and that is, of course, slowness, which renders the film all too often rather bland, and here and there, just plain all-out boring, thus leaving the final product to further lose momentum, something that it hardly has any of to begin with and progressively loses more and more of as things go along. This film is what is it, it's just that what it is is a member of a flawed film type: the mediative film, and on that level, it's still flawed as all get-out, being too meditative, too plotless and too uneven when it does incorporate plot, and when you couple all of that with the kind of overstylizing and slowness that practically defines meditative filmmaking, what you're ultimately left with is a very average meditative film, complete with immense underwhelmingness, but also so many other flaws that, by the end, it descends below average and rests as utterly mediocre, if not borderline bull. Considering the fair couple of aspects in it that are respectable, the final product could never be bad, and while it is never genuinely good, I was willing to stick with it, but after a while of sitting through all of its pretentious, monotonously overbearing over-artistry and scarce substance, I found that I could no longer get behind it, and while the final product is, again, not bad, by the end, I found myself tremendously underwhelmed, considerably unrewarded and rather relieved that the film was over.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the film's artistry is undeniably handsome, and with Bruno Ganz's underwritten yet generally inspired performance and Wim Wenders' mostly charming ambition breathing further life into this film, what we're ultimately left with is a final product that can never be bad, yet can, at the same time, never be anything more than underwhelming, until it becomes incapable of transcending total mediocrity, being tainted by overbearing artistry and meditation that severely dulls down and takes over the film, drenching it in a kind of arrogance that leaves what substance there is to fall flat, and with very little dynamicity or plot available for this film to transcend its missteps, more and more steam goes lost, never to be recovered, until \"Wings of Desire\" finally falls limp as an unrewarding bore that has too many respectable aspects to be utterly dismissed, though not enough for the final product to raise above extreme blandness.\r\n\r\n2/5 - Medicore",

            "content": "There's no denying that \"Wings of Desire\" is a beautiful film and one with some bold ideas and calling it a masterpiece wouldn't be a stretch but the film isn't without its flaws. The film is set in West Berlin at the time when the city was divided by the Berlin Wall. The story follows two angels, Damiel (the principal character, played by Bruno Ganz) and his friend Cassiel (Otto Sander). They are immortal, eternal, intangible and can only be seen by children. They are unable to affect the physical world except by providing spiritual comfort to the humans in their city. Their job is to observe the world (they can move effortlessly pretty much anywhere as well as read minds) and help out in small ways whenever they can. The story also follows some of the people inside Berlin, particularly a wandering poet named Homer (Curt Bois) who worries about the future, a lonely trapeze artist named Marion (Solveig Dommartin) and the American Peter Falk playing himself. As the film progresses it becomes clear that Damiel wants more. He yearns for the ability to taste food, to experience touch, to be able to be seen and to be loved. Unexpectedly, he finds out that there is a way for him to shed his wings and become human.\nNow you're probably wondering to yourself \"Hey, isn't this the plot to that Nicholas Cage, Meg Ryan movie City of Angels?\", well yes and no. The 1998 American film is loosely (very loosely) based on the love story that develops between Damiel and Marion. Other than that and the fact that there are angels living among us, the two have very little in common. This is not a romantic drama. It's a reflective, philosophical piece about the meaning of being human. The film illustrates very well how as people grow up they lose sight of the little things that are important. As humans, we take things for granted, like how great rubbing our hands together to keep them warm feels or the taste of new foods, the ability to tell lies, to imagine things that aren't there or to relax. This outside perspective of an angel, a character that has been around since the dawn of time but is unable to do any of those simple things, will really make you think about what you take for granted as a person. It will also bring you back to a time where as a child you took things at face value. As an adult, you know that as you grow older your personality changes and you become a different person but to children, the idea is unfathomable. Why is that? Does this mean that we lose a part of ourselves as we grow older and wiser? Ideas like this are what make the movie so interesting to discuss.\nOn a technical level, the film is excellent too. The use of colour is very creative for example. To convey the idea that although and angel's life is endless, it is also soulless director Wim Wenders shoots most of the film in black and white. It is only when we see life from the human perspective that we get to see how vibrant everything is and it gives you a glimpse of how hollow a life without touch or creativity would be. It's not that our main character is unhappy; it's that he wants more. The special effects are also very well done. Scenes that show how the angels are able to manipulate objects but can't feel them or affect our world are done creatively and get the point across very clearly, even if you're not thinking about them on a deeper level than just not being able to pick things up and manipulate them at your will. Best of all though is the cinematography. The way that the scenes of Marion on her trapeze are shot, with spotlights aimed at the left and right of the screen so that even when she is swinging outside of the frame we can see her shadow is nothing short of brilliant. If you're a fan of this German expressionism technique, you'll be delighted to see the camera tricks used in the film.\nFor all of the emotional impact and clever ways the film is put together though, there are times when the movie feels slow. For a film that is just over 2 hours long it repeats itself a few too many times. We don't need another reminder of how a child's simple appreciation for things makes them different from adults through an off-screen narration; we just saw a scene where a tent full of children excitedly clapped at a circus performance that in no way impressed their parents or the audience. Yes it's a beautiful and thought provoking moment but the story loses its momentum by pounding the message into your head a few too many times. There are some moments with the old poet Homer that also felt lost in translation and no amount of repetition helped. This might be because I am not very familiar with German history, but if the movie requires you to do research beforehand to understand it, that's a sign of trouble. It would have been a minor quibble except for the fact that it's constantly repeated throughout. It's frustrating that the pace couldn't have been adjusted just a bit to be slightly faster because at the very end of the film there's a moment between Marion and Damiel that should have you on the edge of your seat. You see them approaching each other. This is it! We've been waiting for these two to get together this whole time! Wait... why is she going into a long speech? What do you mean... to be continued?!\nEven you don't know what to expect from \"Wings of Desire\", you'll likely gross restless towards the end. That means it will take some time or even at least one other viewing for it to grow on you. For everything that it does right I recommend it, even while recognizing that a lot of people will see it, won't like it and won't to look more into the film to get a deeper understand or appreciation of the piece. I was moved, inspired and very happy to have seen it even though I was disappointed by the ending and felt like it was a bit dull at times. Decide for yourself though, check it out.
