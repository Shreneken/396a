            "content": "Predator (the first - and only the first) is one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever made. In fact, I would go further - I would say it's one of the greatest action movies ever made. And at a current 80% on RT - it's deeply underrated.\n\nThe story is simple. A team of marines are sent into a jungle to rescue a downed chopper. But the hunters find themselves hunted by something entirely extraterretrial.\n\nIt honestly shouldn't have been the masterpiece it is. A 1980s Arnie B-movie, a duel between man and alien, set entirely in a jungle. And problems with the production abounded. The initial alien design was a disaster, and had to be replaced mid-movie. Filming on location was a horrible experience for cast and crew. But, as is often the case, somehow the worst production result in the best results.\n\nPredator grabs you from the opening shot. Nothing is wasted. And yet, it also doesn't rush. Tension is somehow built at the perfect, goldilocks, pace. A lot of credit goes to the music - one of Alan Silvestri's best scores - militant yet awestruck, it siezes you early on and never lets go. It deservedly won all of the handful of awards the movie received. The location is also used to maximum effect - the jungle itself haunts the characters long before the monster does. Watching the behind the scenes, it is just fascinating how the crew had to 'edit' the on-set jungle - pruning leaves, even building fake trees, to make it more cinematic.\n\nThe camaraderie between the superb cast is palpable, and the military training they received on set is on full display. As for Arnold - this is one of his best performances. Not restrained and robotic like Terminator - but genuine, convincing, and above all vulnerable.\n\nBut above all, it's the structure of the story that is the real triumph here. The story lets us see how completely badass Arnold's team in one of the best shot action sequences of modern movies, before the predator begins to pick them off one by one. Watching the hunters become the hunted, raises the monster's status exponentially, and fills us as the audience with dread. If even THESE guys can't deal with this... The marines are completely outmatched by both the alien's technology and the way it uses the jungle against them. \n\nThere is contextual subtext here - like many 80s movie, America's trauma at being outmatched by an invisible jungle foe in Vietnam is on full display. It's also interesting from a race-theory perspective that the predator (coded black with rastafarian head dress) is more easily seen by the black, native american and female members of the team, and is impossible for the white males to comprehend. This is what a literature degree does to you. The predator is also no typical mindless grizzly - it is a warrior with its own peculiar alien code and goals. A big game hunter after a challenge. Like THE alien of Ripley fame, it is a monster that has spawned many a sequel, but sadly the tantalising glimpses of culture and mythos set up here have never been satisfactoritly developed, at least not by the movies.\n\nAnd the ending? No spoilers here, but the last act does not disappoint. How Arnold comes to terms with the predator is just genius, and satisfies at every level. Predator has been much criticized fro a few deliberately crass jokes (fitting for soldiers?), and is probably widely sneered at by a certain kind of critic just for being this kind of movie with this lead. Hear none of it. This is brilliant writing, design and filmmaking at every level. If you are in any way a fan of either action or sci-fi, and you haven't seen this yet - watch it NOW! Forget the far inferior recent Prey which somehow has a higher rating. Let the Predator hunt you for a couple of hours.",

            "content": "\"Predator\" stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as Dutch, the leader of a skilled mercenary commando group who have been active throughout the war zones of the World. Hired by Dillon ( Carl Weathers ), a senior U.S. military officer, to rescue survivors of a helicopter crash in the Central America jungle, Dutch and his well armed colleagues sneak into their last known location. What ensues is a high octane, gritty action battle very reminiscent of a Vietnam war film. \n\n\"Predator\" starts as a standard action movie full of extreme masculinity but quickly develops into something more thrilling. Once the mercenary group have cleared the area of enemies they discover the mission was more about retrieving information rather than people. This is the first red flag. As they leave the now destroyed compound and base with their spoils, the group become aware something in the jungle is hunting them. From a number of POV shots in blurry, heat seeking vision it becomes clear the hunter is obviously not human. \n\nWhat \"Predator\" purposely does is take a u turn on the Commando groups winning formula of sheer masculinity and over the top personality traits. The initial heroism, massive biceps, excessive gun fire and destruction being the success to any battle this group encounter is useless against the alien now picking them off one by one. Random destruction and excessive gun fire does not work against the well driven hunter. The tone of the movie completely changes from pure action to a sinister thriller. it's now the \"Predator\" that is doing the hunting and not for any other reason than just for sport. It collects skulls as trophies and has the mindset of the thrill of the hunt. This becomes evident when despite all the alien's high tech and what could of been ease of the kill, the predator throws off its armour to fight hand to hand against the almost super human Dutch. The predator is now representing excessive masculinity at its deadly worst. Strong, well built and focussed on its own strength and cunning to win the fight, the predator not only enjoys the thrill of the hunt but finding a worthy adversary to come up against.\n\nA really good action, thriller with a nod to the 1980's slasher films, \" Predator\" still entertains as much today as it did on first release.",

I did not see an authentic jaded GI, but more of an aestehtic muscle man. But I admit, that there was chemistry between him and the rest of the actors/fodder, that worked quite well. \nThe undeniable selling point is the slow and therefor perfect introduction of the Predator and the cat-and-mouse game in the jungle.

            "content": "In a sentence, this is an obviously silly action movie that is remarkably well done and doesn't waste much time –  it also has either a surprisingly subtle surrounding plot or a lot of holes. \n\nThe first scene is the lovely over the top display of guns, fatigues, special-ops name dropping, and muscle which is frankly understandable. There's some general and various allusions to how super duper great Arnold's team is – which also has some sort of conscious – and the other silly nonsense to establish Arnold as \"the best.\" Then there's the ‘secret mission' which is to rescue some VIP which we'll get to in a second.\n\nWhile Arnold's and the plot are introduced in a cheesy and crass way, his team of specialists is surprisingly well introduced in a scene that shows who these characters are rather than through narrative exposition explaining them. Their behaviors and actions allow us, the viewer, to come to the conclusions which the directors want us to about who these are as individuals. For instance, one character is reticent and exhibits some flavor of OCD by shaving incessantly - a behavior which reappears during the more stressful scenes later on.  \n\nThe mission they embark on is swiftly exposed to be a ruse as the team discovers harrowing corpses and unexplained brutality. From then on, the team simply does the mission because they're unable to contact their headquarters. Then comes perhaps the dumbest scene possible, with constant explosions and flying on fire people as Arnold's team engages with some dudes (who cares who they were). Ultimately this scene is really just to show us that Arnold's team is a formidable force to make the Predator who attacks them a little later more unstoppable. There's even a scene where they fire their guns at the space where they think the predator is for around 30 to 60 seconds… or maybe it just felt that way – then they finish this spray and prey with saying \"nothing could have survived that!\" Obviously the team gets picked apart by the predator leaving only Arnold who manages to pick up on that the predator sees with heat vision and that he can use mud to even the odds as he sets primitive traps and fashions primitive-ish weapons from the jungle to do what an entire team - \"the best\" - which included him, could not do and kills the predator. \n\nThe hilarity of Arnold's lines and his fist fight with the predator were pretty fun to watch but I'm still not sure if he point of the original ruse was that the players that sent Arnold's team knew about the predator and that's why they sent them or if it was for the intel which the CIA operative which was embedded with them gathered.",

For most people, this isn't gory often enough to qualify as a 'full blown horror film' but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone especially squeamish or similar. It didn't disturb me too much but in the 1980s it would have done.\n\nThe infra red shots seen quite dated nowadays, as is the special effects but all in all, its a pretty ok action/horror film, as I say. Its cheesy at times and a bit predictable but its also fairly entertaining - not great, not awful. There are some amusing moments in the script - I couldn't help but smile at some of the one liners Schwarzenegger was given. I also thought some of the camera zoom/pan shots were quite amusing.

It's a great time, capturing the era which it came out in but also feeling timeless.\n\nThe story is simple, centering around a group of soldiers who go to rescue hostages in a jungle where they encounter an a Predator, a technologically advanced alien. It sounds simple, and it is. It doesn't need to be complex, because its premise is amplified by the fellowship of characters and their awesome chemistry. Arnold Schwarzenegger delivers a surprisingly strong performance, showing some flexibility in his role. \nThe rest of the cast is great too, exchanging quips and remarks, but also expressing their humanity. You really care for them when they start dying. The Predator itself is menacing, like no other on-screen antagonist. \n\nThe tones well meshed together. It ranges from cheerful, 1980s testosterone and macho men to extreme seriousness, where you genuinely don't know what's going to happen to our characters. It's tense, suspenseful and action packed, never dragging or boring the viewer.\n\n\nThe visuals they use to show the camouflaged Predator hold up pretty well further fuelling the tension and suspense as the heroes face a foe they can not see. The action sequences are great, featuring explosions, usage of heavy artillery as well as blood and gore. The location and cinematography are excellent, capturing the tense, claustrophobic feel of the film. It almost makes you feel as if you're there, watching everything play out. It's strange and uncomfortable. It's further helped by the excellent score from Alan Silvestri.\n\n\nIn conclusion, \"Predator\" is a must watch for all film lovers, action fans and anyone who just wants an entertaining experience. It's a macho 1980s film that's more than just a popcorn flick or stereotype. It's an awesome film and all-time great filled with iconic moments and phrases from one of the genre's best directors, John McTiernan.",

            "content": "Haunting horror atmosphere and intense action unlike anything you've seen!\n\nDirector John McTiernan, of Die Hard, Die Hard with a Vengeance, and Last Action Hero fame, directs his fearsome sci-fi horror action-thriller Predator (1987) with searing vision and innovative techniques. McTiernan's direction is brilliant as Predator pretends it's an ultra American action-thriller with guns blazing and massive explosions, while slowly hinting at an invisible danger, until we see through the Predator's heat vision and realize this is really a horror slasher. I cannot even imagine what watching Predator in a movie theater felt like back in 1987 once you realize the berserker barrage of bullets leads to guerilla warfare and survival horror with a cosmic twist. Predator is one of a kind.\n\nI love that every single time you see the Predator, you learn something new about his alien race, otherworldly technology, or hunter tactics. I'm in awe of how many cool abilities they wrote for the Predator to contain from his heat vision helmet, red eyesight, invisible camouflage, neon green blood, voice recording for mimicry playback diversions, three red dot sight, shoulder mounted laser gun, skull trophy coveting, aiming only for the armed prey for sport, inability to see body heat once flesh is covered in mud, medical packs hidden in his armored gear, jagged dual blades from his wrist, heated blades by laser, clicking noises, silver face mask, James Cameron's idea for face mandibles that open up his mouth, self destruct failsafe, to the Predator's smart fast learning capabilities. The Predator is the ultimate efficient hunter and he remains one of horror's most iconic creatures! The Predator is like the Xenomorph from Alien, but intelligent and able to adapt to different hunting tactics.\n\nJohn McTiernan's direction is truly inventive. Allowing us as the audience to see in heat vision with blurred motion like the Predator is super cool, immediately shocking, and outstandingly creative direction from McTiernan. He makes the jungle as foreboding and scary like the Predator could be hiding in any tree. Predator feels like an amalgamation of many classics like the eerie wilderness and haunting atmosphere of Apocalypse Now, the tense jungle chases and daring escapes of Deliverance, the brazen hunting of men for ruthless sport and gory bodily trophies like The Most Dangerous Game, all mixed with the lethal vicious extra-terrestrial of Alien. Gunfire upon gunfire with all manner of survival tactics at play. Predator remains gripping, scary, and intriguing as tension rises into the finale of Arnold versus the Predator ensues.\n\nWriters Jim Thomas and John Thomas deliver fiery language, hilarious one liners, startlingly real characterization, and terrifying horror scenarios. I've already detailed how creatively they thought about the Predator's gear and abilities. Predator features one of the most efficient scripts I've ever heard. Each person just says their honest observations with a blunt realism and haunted faces. The dialogue is at a minimum, but very expressive. I like how with each Predator reveal we realize he is a clever hunter, capable of healing himself, as he carefully engages in guerilla warfare to hunt down his human prey. There's simply no more chilling horror action film.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger is commanding and cool as Major Alan \"Dutch\" Schaefer. Dutch is as buff as Schwarzenegger has ever looked, but it is also Arnold's expressive faces of worry, shock, and determination that make Dutch such a fabulous action hero for Predator. He's a strong man, but a stronger leader with real convictions. He wants to save lives in his mercenary missions, but all to keep his crew alive as he nearly sacrifices himself for the lives of his surviving men. Arnold delivers some of his finest acting in Predator with funny one liners, haunted faces, worried lines, and all in a gritty display of masculine strength and perseverance. His thousand mile stare in the helicopter at the end of Predator looks like the PTSD dead eyed glare of real war veterans.\n\nCarl Weathers is excellent as the shady CIA operative Al Dillon. He feels like Dutch's old friend, but also a scumbag CIA agent willing to sacrifice every man there for the mission. Weathers is as muscular and ripped as Arnold with enough muscles to move mountains and sheer charisma to captivate any viewer. I don't know who looks more jacked between Arnold's giant arms or Carl's rippled abdomen. Elpidia Carrillo is enchanting and gripping as the lovely insurgent Anna Gonsalves. Her looks of being scared and nervous are chilling. I love how diverse Predator's cast is too by the way.\n\nBill Duke is purely adrenaline as the gripping machine gunner Sergeant Mac Eliot. His blindfire machine gunning into the woods once he sees the Predator is actually terrifying. Duke plays a man completely hypnotized by fear and revenge. Richard Chaves is funny as explosives expert Jorge \"Poncho\" Ramírez with his rapid fire grenade launcher for explosive scenes. Jesse Ventura basically plays himself as the embodiment of toxic male attributes heavy gunner Blain Cooper with his brutal minigun \"Ol' Painless.\" His soaring gunfire is as loud as the gun blasts in Heat. Sonny Landham is fascinating as the Native American tracker and scout Billy Sole. You can tell he's aware there's something in the woods. His stares into the distance are eerie. Shane Black is hilarious because he's not funny as the wise cracking radio operator Rick Hawkins. I have to mention the massive Kevin Peter Hall as the Predator. He's terrifying and expressive without any real dialogue.\n\nCinematographer Donald McAlpine shoots beautiful establishing wide shots of the forestry. His lush greens and woodsy browns with moodily lit shots create a real eerie atmosphere for Predator. The fast sweeping panning shots for running and slow shots of the Predator's vision are haunting unto themselves. You're always searching the woodland environment for any hint or sign of the Predator until you glimpse his invisible camouflage moving in a blur. I like how the camera perspective changes from person to Predator. You always feel his eyes watching the mercenary group. I love McAlpine's striking close-ups of fear or hesitation. Editors Mark Helfrich and John F. Link's cuts from perspectives gives the viewer every angle of the jungle to really scan each frame for the Predator.\n\nJohn Vallone's production design features jungle military bases and crafty forest hunting traps. I love all the props from the Predator's knives to the mini gatling gun Ventura sports. Predator's art direction from Jorge Sainz, Theresa Wachter, and Frank Richwood is stunning with lovely jungle trees and leaves everywhere and dingy mud covering the Earth. Predator focuses on the trees to really drive home that the Predator could be hiding amongst any of the natural environment. Set decoration from Enrique Estévez and Macedonio Ramos put CIA secrets, ammunitions, and guns littered all over besides extra twigs and tree branches.\n\nI adore the practical Predator costume. The visual effects for the Predator's heat vision and camouflage from artists Joel Hynek, William Stout, Michael Bigelow, Robert M. Greenberg, and Robert Mrozowski are brilliant. I think Predator's are not dated at all as its eerie seeing a blurry screen and primitive blurs and lasers coming from the Predator. His sharp three red dot sights are scary and fun. The green Predator blood being the inside liquid of glow sticks is straight up genius.\n\nComposer Alan Silvestri's bombastic score is so creative and adds layers to Predator's thrills. Silvestri writes these huge symphonic bursts for the action, while hinting at the Predator's presence with thudding drums and eerie melodies. Predator has one of the 1980's greatest film scores. You rarely hear an action-thriller with such exhilarating music that bounces between loud action rhythms and fearsome melodies for the horror sequences. Silvestri's score anticipates the Predator's appearances, really upping the ante on Predator's horror suspense.\n\nPredator's sound design is incredibly clever from sound designers and mixers Richard L. Anderson, George H. Anderson, Gary Wright, Gene Corso, Richard Shorr, Catherine Shorr, and David E. Stone. From the Predator's clicking tones, footsteps snapping tree branches, to the whispering echoes to the voices that the Predator is replaying to lure his prey out into the open during his sick hunt. Their sound design adds to Predator's ambiance that makes 107 stretch into gripping eternity in the very best of ways.\n\nCostume designers Marilyn Vance, James W. Tyson, and Robert B. Harris creates unearthly combat and survival gear for the Predator and mercenary and army gear for the heroes. Everyone is decked out in short sleeves or tank tops to show off manly muscles, while carrying belts of ammo. Make-up artist Scott H. Eddo nails Predator's look. I like how sweaty everyone looks here in the heat of the jungle for realism. They've all got gritty looks.\n\nIn conclusion, Predator not only holds up, but remains a frightening and thrilling experience.",

My main issue is that the story is not the most original, creative, or interesting in the slightest.

The movie begins with the single greatest handshake of all time (so good, it became a meme) and unravels into an action-packed, sci-fi horror where the Central American jungle is the haunted house and an invisible, alien being (Kevin Peter Hall) as the monster. Arnold Schwarzenegger as Dutch leads the hunky mercenaries into some Cold War proxy mission thinking they're going on a rescue mission against insurgents. Instead, the eponymous predator picks off the gang one-by-one until the final showdown, mano-a-mano, between him and Arnie. The dialogue is filled with 80s action-movie goodness, including, but not limited to, \"stick around,\" (after Arnie pins an insurgent to the wall with a machete), \"I ain't got time to bleed,\" (Cooper's (Jesse Ventura) badass, but nonsensical, line concerning his injuries), and probably one of the most famous movie lines from the decade, \"Get to the chopper!\". You know who says it. The practical effects are lovely — Mac's (Bill Duke) mini-gun scene, the spin-removing carnage — and the predator's reveal is great. I remember being disappointed of what the alien looked like when I was a kid, considering how cool he appears with the mask, but I've found a newfound appreciation for that webbed face only a mother could love. Predator is a movie that knows what it is and deserves all the love it gets from those who saw it back in 1987 and those still discovering it today. If you're looking for a throwback summer blockbuster full of biceps and abs and one-liners you'll be saying until Wednesday, then throw on Predator.",

The details are just underwhelming. The fighting tactics they threw each other were overused in regular action films. I got little suspense, or sci-fi from it, and the impracticality and incoherence took a bit away from the action. But I still appreciate the cinematography, how they operated in the jungle, and the earlier part of script, and I guess how it's one of the first of action focused sci-fi.",

En route the team are attacked and gradually knocked off one by one by an unseen combatant, which is eventually revealed to be an aggressive alien who seems to be hunting humans just for fun. Director John McTiernan does a great job of gradually building tension in the movie, and the story moves at a good pace as it builds to its climatic fight scene between Schwarzenegger's character and the killer alien. The make-up and special effects are fantastic, in particular the alien costume, worn by Kevin Peter Hall as the titular Predator.

After Dutch's team decimates the enemy, including some Soviet officers, they learn that it was all a set-up by Dillon to get information from the enemy. Only one is left alive — Anna (Elpidia Carrillo) — so the team takes her to the extraction zone.\n\nAnd this is where Predator flips the script.\n\nWritten by Jim and John Thomas (Mission to Mars, Executive Decision) and directed by John McTiernan (Die Hard, Last Action Hero), this film starts as a testosterone-laced ode to American firepower and then becomes a slasher, as the team is followed by an invisible, nearly-unstoppable alien hunter (Kevin Peter Hall) who has come from space just for the sport of hunting these soldiers.\n\nThe inspiration for the film came from a joke that after Rocky IV, Stallone had run out of opponents on Earth. If they made another film, he'd have to fight an alien. Jim and John Thomas were inspired by that and wrote Hunter, which became Predator. One could argue that they had seen Without Warning, which is nearly the same idea, with an alien — armed with futuristic weaponry and also played by Kevin Peter Hall — on Earth to hunt humans.\n\nThere are so many stories about how JCVD was once the Predator. Why that ended is up for debate. Maybe it's because Van Damme was ony 5'9″. Or it could have been because all Jean Claude did was complain about the suit being so hot that he kept passing out. Or maybe the original design just didn't work. The Stan Winston redesign? It's as iconic as the xenomorphs of Alien, which the Predator would get to battling soon enough.\n\nPredator just works. I'm a fan of Predator 2 as well, but the first film is absolutely perfect. The ultimate hunter against the ultimate soldier? Yeah, this is what an action movie should be.",

The writing is quite a bit stale and definitely reflects the common trend of 80's movie that are solely focused on great action, and there are a lot of F-words, 106 to be precise.\nSo, if a movie has no dialogue, then it only has action, and that's really all Predator has. The first half of the movie's action begins with the soldiers raiding a central American jungle to find hostages, a scene that feels like it lasts far too long, which may be due to the fact that the film hasn't set itself up as pure action yet, making the audience wonder why a film would have room for so much action. After the hostage raid, the soldiers slowly get picked of one by one by the Predator in the goriest fashion possible, including Carl Weathers getting his arm (That's still firing a gun) cut off before being killed, a guy getting his skull ripped out of his back, and the soldiers finding a group of men skinned in the thick of the jungle.\n80's nostalgia probably led people to think the movie was way better than it is, and it probably only had success because of the 80's obsession with sci-fi and action; this is reflected by the ratings of the modern-day iteration of Predator, with rotten tomatoes giving it a 33%.

I really liked the story and concept behind the film. The Predator is scary and one of my favorite movie monsters. Overall, this was a great movie and I had a lot of fun watching it.

            "content": "In 1987 John McTiernian, made a film production, which is for many a classic of the 80s and also of science fiction, of course part of this popularity comes thanks to the \"great and muscular\" Arnold Schwarzenegger who had generated popularity for \"Terminator\" (1984), in which he had impressed many, so to attract more audiences they decided to hire Mr. Schwarzenegger.\n\nThe film in a nutshell is about how Arnold and his squad of muscular military men have to go to the jungle for a mission that was entrusted to them, but after that, a mysterious creature from space will go hunting them one by one.\n\nOne of the main problems with the film, would come from the fact that it cares more about creating a great show than creating tension, at least from my perspective, there was no time when I felt worried about what was going to happen, Added to this is the fact that the film ends up being predictable on multiple occasions, you easily get the idea of ​​who is going to die and who is not, a simple series example that was more than obvious that Arnold could not die, because he is Arnold and it had to look good, it is very convenient for me that the predator does not kill Arnold when he already has him against the wall and for some illogical reason decides to fight hand to hand against him and give him time to get up when he throws him, the problem is that previously they showed us that the predator is a merciless being who brutally kills its victims, what I am trying to say is that it does not go with the character, and as I said earlier, I see it as an excuse for Arnold n or die. To tell the truth, the film is so quick to get into action that it raises questions such as Why is the predator thirsty to kill everything that moves? Why was the predator sent to earth? If you only walk through the trees killing the military that pass by, at no time does the movie make you understand that this one has a mission or something like that, if it had crashed into the earth by accident, ok, that would make more sense, but for some reason the writers decided not to do it that way.\nBut to be honest, not everything is so bad, in my opinion the way in which the predator is going to be difficult, I find it interesting, because they do not teach you later how it is physically, so for the time when the The movie was released, it seems to me something well accomplished, the camera movements are fine, I have no complaints with that, and the costume design (The Predator) is well done.\nThen there are the performances which, to tell the truth, are all very acceptable. Although I previously said that the film fails to create suspense, if I mention that it manages to create a great show, by this I mean that the action and all that that entails is good, it entertains you in a certain way. The special effects are good, I know that, to the human eye of today, they might look bad, but they are not so bad, they are old, the problem is, in my opinion, older movies like Star Wars: A New Hope (1977) has better special effects.\nIn conclusion, \"Predator\" is a science fiction classic, which is more concerned with action, the show, than creating tension or characters that matter to you. With the typical plot holes of this type of film, but in the end it manages to be entertaining thanks to its direction and good action, and as I said, it must be taken into account that the predator managed to be a classic science fiction character.",

The Predator is one of the coolest monster designs in film history next to the Xenomorph from Alien; however sometimes the special effects for the Predator's invisibility make it move through the air very slowly and unconvincingly.  Predator mixes a kick-butt action flick with a healthy dose of Arnold and the result is a damn fun and entertaining ride that makes you want to hit the gym way more.",

            "content": "Predator is one of the greatest action movies of all time, produced in 1987 starring Arnold Schwarzenegger (Dutch) and directed by John McTiernan. Arnold was one of the biggest stars in the world at the time and it showed, him and Carl Weathers (Dillon) plus a bunch of others who are a special force team sent in to fight against some Guatemalan threats who have people captured that they need to save and get out of there, at least that is what they all tell Arnold. This Movie is one of the greatest action movies of all time with the fights between the Guatemalan threats being one of the best actions scenes I've seen in a movie showcasing all the groups strengths, Arnold having his strength be his best strength and characters, Carl being a leader and the man with the game plan, but one of the most famous parts of this movie is from Jessie Ventura (Blain) who is the heavy gunner.  \n\n \n\nThe movie is pretty fast paced with a lot of explosions and fighting all the way through but also it takes time to slow down and explain what is happening so the viewer doesn't get lost. Predator in a way has a horror affect due to the actual Predator, and no one knowing what it is and if it can even be killed. The characters all try and do their best to kill the \"monster\" slash \"alien\" but one by one everyone is \"hunted\" by the beast except for Dutch obviously.  \n\n \n\nPredator is a great movie to watch anytime but now especially since it almost Halloween. The directors do a great job to make this movie for just about everyone, though it might not be great for little kids due to the monster and killing explaining why it has a R rating. This movie has moments of suspense, fear, sadness, and mainly a lot of action. I love everything about this movie except one thing, and that is that at the end of the movie once Dutch gets out of there and is safe, they never say what happens to him after everything, which would be nice to know. \n\n \n\nMainly I would like people who see a Syfy/Action/Horror movie and automatically just don't give it a chance because of the genre it is, but really is a great movie with a really good story. The Jessie Ventura says the line \"I ain't got time to bleed\" plus many more famous lines and scenes. But at the end of the day this is an iconic movie and I think everyone should at least give it a chance and if they don't like it that's fine but more than likely they are going to find a movie they will really like.

And it doesn't disappoint: we're served a buffet of idiotic one-liners, baby-oiled biceps, dismembered limbs, explosive firestorms and cute personality traits. More surprisingly, we also get a fairly effective science fiction thriller, one that's become remarkably influential in the thirty years since its premiere.\n\nFilmed in an age before computer-rendered effects were the norm, Predator still looks convincing and impressive, especially in regards to the alien monster himself. His advanced arsenal is borderline revolutionary, a fantastic mix of high-tech and low that never quite breaks the illusion of reality, and his getup is both sleekly futuristic and functionally simple. He's a conundrum, hard to handle for a variety of reasons, which makes his lengthy final battle with Arnold (seriously did not remember how long those two went mano a mano) all the more interesting.\n\nAn unusually fresh, consistent example of an era and genre mix that doesn't usually age very well.

The score is breathtaking, bringing an image of the jungle. it is one of the best action films of all time, it has a sense of comradery with the team that makes you care, sure they may be a little one-note but I fell that it is intentional. The film tries to subvert the action hero genre of the '80s: they are masculine manly men who kill everybody with nothing but a scratch in an action sequence that is quick-cut and chaotic. The beauty of the film is that it subverts it during the latter half when the predator comes in. The fact that they made a B-movie concept into a great film deserves praise by itself in my opinion.",

A film that mixes together the buff ass men of the 80's mixed with sci-fi and a little bit of horror Predator works on many levels. Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his group of mercenaries are hired by the CIA to infiltrate a Central American country to supposedly save someone. Dutch is teamed with an old friend named Dillon (Carl Weathers) who is acting as the CIA's liaison. Soon enough the team comes across the guerrillas they believe to be responsible for the death of a helicopter crew, but realize they've been duped by the CIA to do their \"dirty work\" (this isn't a spoiler trust me). Before long the team starts to realize that something in the jungle is hunting them taking them down one by one. That's about it. The plot is basic and to the point. Schwarzenegger is his all time 80's self here and the role just fits him perfect with some of his most memorable one liner's coming from this film. There really is no character development here, but you're not here to see that. The team has all the stereotypical kind of group bondness going on and traits. We have the ex friends, the jokester, the stoic/crazy guy, the nerdy guy, etc. The predator itself is well done here too. For 1987 they did what they could and while a lot of the effects don't look too great now a days the reveal at the end still pays off quite well. Is it predictable? Yes. But most importantly is it enjoyable and fun as hell to watch? Well to quote Mr. Schwarzenegger \"Stick Around!\" aka yes.",

            "content": "\"STICK AROUND!\" \n\n\tPredator, starring Arnold Swarzennegger, as Major Alan \"Dutch\" Shaefer entered theaters in June 1987.  It blasted its way into summer theaters with a pronounced bang, grossing more than 98 million dollars worldwide. Since then, it has become one of the best sci-fi action movies of all time and is one of my favorite movies.  Predator is awesome because it upends the traditional heroes journey where the protagonist starts from nothing and ends up being the start of the show.  With Predator you get an elite paramilitary unit who is at the top of their game physically and emotionally that gets destroyed and reduced to nothing.  One by one, they are killed until just one remains.  That character, Dutch, has to recover from the utter defeat brought to him and his men, to come back and prevail over the Predator. The concept for the movie started out as a joke that the only person Rocky hadn't fought yet was E.T Thus the idea for the movie was born.  Initially being called hunter, but later dropped and changed to just Predator.  \n\tThe human star of the show Arnold Swarzennegger was in his hay day, having recently done movies like The Terminator, Commando, and Raw Deal.  This was another movie role that no one else at the time could do justice.  He had a great supporting cast, with stars like Jessie Ventura, Carl Weathers, Elpidia Carrillio, and Shane Black.  The antagonist of the film, the Predator, played by Kevin Peter Hall does an amazing job portraying the alien on the hunt.  At a 73-minute run time, it's not the longest movie.  The pace is a fast one, with small lulls in the action that make you wait patiently for what comes next.  The movie was Filmed almost entirely on location in Mismaloya, Mexico, which provided beautiful physical locations to film.   \n\tThe friendship and comradery of Dutch's team is something you can easily see in the film.  It lets you get really invested with each character.  They work together like a well-oiled machine.  You can see this in one of the first action scenes in the film where they initially communicate with hand and arm signals until the action kicks off.  They actually trained for months before the movie, this led to them actually preforming like a real unit.  They portray the classic expendable force used by the government to get the job done.  Case in point, they get goat roped into rescuing operation for the CIA that actually turns out to be a totally different mission.  They quickly find out that something is hunting their team and has already decimated a previous team.  After a few of them start to be killed off by the films antagonist, the Predator, they take a captive prisoner who tells them that something is hunting them for sport.  Saying it comes when its hot, and it's been very hot this summer, and that its name means who takes trophies of man.  The Predator engages in a total unfair fight at first, using its optic camouflage to remain invisible, and using its shoulder mountain plasma canon to blast through the men.  All of the team except Dutch and his captive are eventually killed.  The climax of the movie is between Dutch and the Predator.  With a frantic battle of whit and physical prowess.  If finally deems Dutch worthy to engage in a fair fight for the honor of who's stronger than who.  In the end, Dutch is the victor.  The Predator, defeated, activates a self-destruct device and removes any trace of its existence.  Dutch and his prisoner are then picked up by the CIA and the movie ends.\n\tOriginally, concepts for the Predator had Jean-claude Van Damme portraying the role.  This didn't work out, and he was replaced by Kevin Peter Hall.  This was the best decision that could have ever been made, Van Damme's costume was akin to an orange lobster, while Stan Winston created one of the most iconic movie monsters of all time for Kevin Peter Hall to bring to life.  His performance worked was made even better by his size.  He made the main actors like Arnold look small, giving an actual sense that he could get his ass kicked by the Predator! \n\tThe special effects of the movie still hold up today.  The iconic thermal heat vision used by the Predator is instantly recognizable.  Equally identifiable is are the invisibility effects of the Predator's cloaking ability, as well as its now iconic glowing green blood.  The blood was made by mixing liquid from glow sticks with oil for texture.  These affects got the film a nomination for an Academy Award for Visual Effects.  The predator click noises it makes, are as recognizable as they are creepy, and the overall portrayal of the Predator is amazing.\n\tSnappy one liners are a plenty in the film, and lend a sometimes comical relief to another wise suspenseful tone.  A few examples are the notable, \"Get to the choppaa!\", or \"I ain't got time to bleed,\" \"Do you have time to duck?\".  Another early exchange with Jesse Ventura's character has his asking if anyone wants some of his chew and stating,\" This stuff will make you a God Damn sexual Tryannosauras, just like me!\".  Mid way through the movie in an attack scene on a Guerilla HQ, an enemy tries to sneak up on Dutch, and in turn gets a machete thrown into his chest, with Dutch telling him, \"Stick Around!\"  One liners like these were common place in the 1980's, and this movie doesn't disappoint.  Every time you watch this movie, at least one of them will get stuck in your head.  \n\tPredator has one of the most iconic and recognizable sound tracts that was composed by Alan Silverstri.  The music brings you into the scenes and carries you through to the end battles.  He had just come off creating music for Back to the Future.  Another notable score is the music in the beginning helicopter sequence, Little Richard's Long Tall Sally.  Every time I hear that song it makes me think of that part of the movie and Jesse Ventura's sexual Tyrannosauras comments.  It is now considered one of the best sci-fi action films of all time, and at the time of its release it was well received with audiences.  There have been countless other movies to replicate the overall story setup, but none have ever been as good as the original.  I give this movie 5 Stars out of 5 and is my all time favorite!",

Good news, girls, the one female character may not really do anything but you've got yourselves some fanservice here. Bunch of buff muscular dudes who got to show off their muscles even more later on in the movie. The special effects have aged incredibly well. They were groundbreaking when they came out and are still admirable to this day. The invisibility effect looks somewhat outdated but still kind of cool since I don't think they used actual CGI in spite of what its movement and visual appearance when playing the chameleon might say. The actual creature when visible looks quite good. I understand why comics were made that have them fighting xenomorphs which were then adapted into two movies that don't have the best of reputations. Since I ain't got time to write a longer review than this, let's just say that Predator is an all-around fun action movie even if it has its more cheesy moments.",

            "content": "In many respects, Predator is part of the Alien merchandise which is why there is a spin-off film to it called Alien vs. Predator. After I reviewed all of the Alien films I decided I would now review Predator which it stars Arnold Schwarzenegger and many more. It's not even a horror film, it's more like an action sci-fi film which occasionally had some scares. It's nothing that scary apart from when it's quiet. There occasionally have some blood and guts for the most part. The opening is pretty impressive and the ending is spectacular. the story is very basic, simple and straight forward. I know that years ago critics giving it mixed reviews saying the story is too flat and paper thinned, I can see why. The third act is where Arnold Schwarzenegger as Dutch being very quiet trying to kill the predator once and for all. The third act doesn't even have any dialogue apart from the end where he says ''Bleed, b!£$%^d.'' and the one that everybody says it's a memorable line in the movie industry is ''You one ugly motherf$%ker.'' I know there's plenty to go around but that's the way the movie goes. There's another memorable that Schwarzenegger said. All he said is ''Get to the chopper!'' I just realise that years back! Oh, oh, and if you think that is not enough? Why don't you take a look at this! Blain played by Jesse Ventura says a line that I know as a kid is that Jonah from Splashdown 2: Rides Gone Wild fails, he says ''I ain't got time to bleed.'' and wouldn't you know it? Jesse says it. Oh, Jesus, if many of the characters ripping off the films that many of the actors said, this game would be pop culture. Maybe Jesse Ventura have got time to duck. it really had an all star cast who are in the jungle. It has Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, Elpidia Carrillo, Jesse Ventura, Richard Chaves, Bill Duke, Sonny Landham, Shane Black and then there's Kevin Peter Hall as the Predator. It shows the from the beginning of the end credits which is really impressive. Bill Duke also worked with Arnold Schwarzenegger in Commando which is rather usual. He played a bad guy in Commando and now he played a good guy in Predator. Shane Black's character is the character who tells Billy laugh by telling his puxxy jokes. He only did it about two times. Billy played by Sonny Landham is afraid of no man. Now the Predator is in the jungle to kill people and take their body of bones out of their skins and camouflages like a chameleon and can make himself disappear. If you think Aliens isn't enough? Then you've haven't seen Predator with some action packed thrills and occasional scares and a straight forward simple basic story. I love the opening and I love the ending. I would actually prefer the Alien films because they're really scary film and it will scare the living s£!t out of you and me. Predator is just your good action sci-fi flick directed by the same guy who directed one of my favourite films of all time Die Hard, John McTiernan. It has some good effects on the predator and yeah, that's about it. There're sometimes one-liners in this from Schwarzenegger are too vague like ''Stick around.'' and ''Knock knock.'' but that's only two times. And you will the predator bleed showing green blood because if it bleeds, we can kill it.\n\n\"You one ugly motherf£$ker.''",

It's certainly a lot of fun.\n       This movie is certainly a mix of a lot of things. At the beginning, it's somewhat slow-building and suspenseful, which was interesting. It was certainly not a bad move, we get to slowly figure out what's going on in the audience, and we also start to wonder what's going on. It's a suspenseful atmosphere, and I loved it. It reminds me a lot of Jaws, the \"bad guy,\" so the speak, is slowly introduced while we're expiriencing it through the characters' eyes, more or less, and I liked that a lot. But when it kicks into the Predator action, it's also enjoyable. It doesn't have the feel that movies like this should, but the last 30 minutes do a good enough job of that. This part of the movie really feels like an action movie. It's a great part of this movie, and the last half hour made me like this one a lot more. It does a good enough job of pulling off the over the top and intense feel these movies should have. It just felt like there were a few missed opportunities that could have made this movie better.\nSomething else worth noting is some of the performances in this movie. Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job being the action hero type character a movie like this should have. He pulls it off like it should be done. The creature performance by Kevin Peter Hall is also great. The Predator has a somewhat human like, somewhat robot like, and somewhat alien like feel. I loved the Predator. It's a very original idea, as far as some of the aspects, and the execution of the Predator is spot on. The special effects, when there are any, are very impressive as well.\n       Overall, Predator had a somewhat slow building, intense story through the eyes of the characters, featuring a great action hero performance from Schwarzenegger and a great creature performance for the Predator, even if there were missed opportunities that could have made this movie better. It's a solid action movie that's worth watching!",

There are times where the movie moves slow, but that's because it's meant to build up the suspense and mystery that's in the film's plot.

Your probably the reason there are 35 remakes of the same movie cause you want the same thing over and over with cgi up the butt and bit fancy model actors who all look like out of Abercrombie ad.  The movie business lost its way , this movie was made before that happened . Who says orchestrated music is bad ? Lol  you want cheesy synth music ? Should Star Wars had a Green Day music back drop ?

The soundtrack feels wrong - it is all symphonic, an old-school Hollywood score (by Alan Silvestri) - no rock music or blaring guitars or screeching crashing exploding \"percussion\".  This somehow makes Predator a bit dreamier and more unworldly than your modern action film.  It also feels a lot more \"low budget\" - although in reality the special effects probably cost millions more than today's digital contributions.  A lot of things blow up.  The plot is simple:  Arnold and his band of commandos are dropped off in the jungle (Mexico playing South America) to rescue some hostages but instead meet a virtually indestructible, nearly invisible, humanoid alien with high tech weaponry hell-bent on destroying (and eating?) them.  By the end, it is Arnold vs. Predator mano a mano as you knew it would be.  Arnold has his schtick down pat by this point in his career, letting one-liners rip and giving a surprisingly thoughtful performance (as far as he could).  His super-stardom and comedic turns were just a year or two away.  In the end, Predator didn't exactly wow me but it held together fine.  ImDB proudly announces that this is one of a few films with two future US Governors (Jesse Ventura is the other) - how's them apples?",

Acting was decent action was great. The Predator himself the character became a iconic figure threw out pop culture with this movie.

Every scene has it's own music which makes suspense even better. \n\nThird: The script: to the point and straight forward for the elite squad who are the hunters, until it makes a twist, and when the Predator came they become hunted. \n\nFourth: The characters are simply perfect and there is no other actors who could play these roles as better as them. The general - excellent, with few lines and exact orders. Dutch - the perfect leader, strong, the biggest of the group, muscular as hell, composed and collected. Dillon - a little smaller than Dutch, cunning and determined to fulfill his own mission, after all succeeded until the moment the Predator came. Anna - great as portraying their prisoner. Mac - the best acting in the movie of all the actors in it, first in the scene where he saw the Predator, second after the shooting and third - his monologue about his buddy Blane. Blane - excluding Dutch, the biggest macho in the squad, and in real life the only actor in the movie who actually experienced war and being a real soldier. Billy - the powerful, big, strange, dark and foreboding Indian with his own code of war. Poncho - tough, almost as the big guys and with great lines in the movie, always helps when it counts. Hawkins - the perfect radio soldier with the sexist jokes to cheer up the others, and he would've been distinctive without his glasses. The Predator - great super tall actor who makes Dutch look small.\n\nFifth - The effects - way ahead of it's time. Great even watching at 2016. May be the best effects an action movie ever made. \n\nSixth - The lines - How can you forget: \"Get to the chopper!\", \"If it bleeds we can kill it!\", \"Any time.\", \"I ain't got time to bleed\", \"Stick around\", \"You're one ugly mother f&ck&r\" and many more. \n\nSeventh - The atmosphere of the movie is makes you feel you are one of them or the Predator. \n\nHence: if you're an Action Sci-Fi Horror fan this is the best movie for you. For me it's the best of all time, because I've watched it more than 500-600 times and still watch it today.",

It is everything I thought it to be as a child and more.\n\nThe action is exhilarating and kept at a snappy pace with enough suspense to thrill, while the special effects are truly excellent, they are memorable, look great and enhance rather than distract. The characterisation is also good, the story is gripping, Alan Silvestri's score is terrific, the pace is snappy, McTiernan's direction is efficient and the dialogue is quotable. The acting I have no problems with either, Arnold Schwarznegger gives one of his most charismatic, efficient and likable performances here.\n\nOverall, a great film and a classic of its decade.
