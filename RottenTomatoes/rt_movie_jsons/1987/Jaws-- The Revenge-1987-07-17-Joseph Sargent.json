            "content": "0 out of 5. This film should be studied by everyone to understand what makes a terrible movie and a terrible sequel. The cinematography actually is ok camerawork and lighting wise. It's the fact that the scenes themselves are filled with either boring nonsensical scenes or outright batshit insane plot scenes that makes it bizarrely terrible. The music isn't good either, its a mix of boring generic cinematic music and the actual Jaws theme with literally no change to it from the first and its barely used. The editing and pacing are horrifically bad because its filled with boring subplots about Michael and his Mother that literally contribute nothing to the plot and are not well acted. The acting slowly gets worse in this. Easily Michael is the worst character and is terrible and makes just a dumb choice to not tell his family about the shark and never gets scared. Making the Mother have a telepathic connection with the shark is one of the stupidest ideas I have ever heard of for a character in a movie ever. The special effects are terrible as the shark is constantly stiff and looks fake even more so than the other films. It's such a shame because this is such a nice location this takes place in as well. The dumb choices characters make like not going to the final confrontation without any weapons, the dumb ways characters are written, the SUPER DUMB plot, the horrifically boring middle of this that contributes nothing to the plot, the bizarre in between movie backstory of what happened to Roy Schneider, and no tension in the slightest makes this one of the worst sequels and films ever made. You know I have to say the worst part for me wasn't even the Roaring Shark or the dumb plot...it was the beyond BORING subplots in the middle of the film where Michael and his Mom have there romance subplots and family issues...It's soooo boring. I'm honestly recommending this though for anyone who wants to learn what makes a terrible sequel and a bad movie in general.",

            "content": "So, a 4th Jaws movie who wouldve thought, even after the disaster that was Jaws 3D the studio decided \"hey the problem with that movie is that we did it in 3D let's try it again and get rid of the 3D but still keep the awful writing, direction, acting, cinematography, editing (some of the shark kills are so cheap and choppy sometimes it's ridiculous don't even know whats happening) and the blatantly obvious visual effects my god they made practical effects look bad how does one achieve that? I'm more impressed than disappointed. Even the title doesn't make sense it completely contradicts an important line in Jaws 2 where a scientist points out \"Sharks don't make things personal Chief Brody\"  however this shark has so much vengeance in him he swims from one ocean to another, that's not even possible for a shark for fack sake. Its as if they only did this for money……….. well, we all know Michael Caine did and I respect him for that. I first saw this movie when I was about 9 years old and even then I switched it off after 20 minutes and if you can't even entertain a snotty 9-year-old kid who's obsessed with sharks then you've failed on a catastrophic level. \nThey even straight up copy scenes from the first film for example the sweet and endearing scene when Brody's son mimics his movements and facial expressions well suck out all the soul that scene had and plaster it in this movie, do you get it? We're being relatable this doesn't come off as lazy in the slightest. They even steal the final scene where the sharks corpse sinks to the bottom of the ocean talk about hitting rock bottom…………….. (Sorry not sorry)\nThis movie manages however to find the perfect balance between depression and hilarity. The effects are awful don't get me wrong however they make the film entertaining, but the ending is one to be desired. Depending on which version you watch there are two endings one where the shark stands up on its tail out of the water and explodes when it gets lightly touched by the boat and you can tell it's a miniature model of the shark especially when you pause it at the right moment and the far superior ending is when the same thing happens the shark ROARS and stands up on the water as if its Jesus Christ himself and the boat just stabs it then the shark just dies and spews blood everywhere it is comical which is why as much as I hate this film I would only watch it drunk.\nOverall, it's a sad sombre sitcom with a shark as a guest star. the saddest part though is that its memorable for all the wrong reasons. Watch it drunk or high or even both that's the only way to watch this utter garbage. \n-10/10",

            "content": "I didn't see Jaws:The Revenge until recently, after hearing so many bad things about it. And I do wish I left it alone, this has a reputation on the whole as being one of the worst sequels ever, and as far as I'm concerned that reputation is deserved. Steven Spielberg's Jaws is brilliant, not only one of his best films but also the very movie that made me afraid to go into the sea.\n\nJaws:The Revenge didn't have that effect on me whatsoever. In alternative to giving genuine scares and thrills, the whole film is laughable. Especially in the plot, which is really quite inept, and in the climax, which is the epitome of WTF? Jaws:The Revenge also has some embarrassingly cheesy dialogue and poor pacing. Then there's the direction, Spielberg's direction was one of the many things that made the 1975 film so good, but the direction here from Joseph Sargent is incompetent.\n\nThe production values don't fare much better. The locations are quite nice but the cinematography and lighting are altogether unexceptional. The music is also disappointing, whereas the music was what made Jaws so unnerving in terms of mood, it was way too gimmicky here. The less said about Bruce the shark the better, he is not menacing at all, instead he is one of the many laughable assets of the film. Also he is not used well at all, and there is little to no build-up or suspense whenever he appears on screen. The acting is atrocious, the only actor who tries and the only redeeming quality is Michael Caine who deserves better. Lorraine Grey is annoyingly neurotic, while I was shocked that the talented late Judith Barsi would participate in such a mess, and her talents aren't even put to good use. Don't get me started on Mario Van Peebles, him, his character and his comic lines are annoying and get old fast.\n\nOverall, a terrible film and one of the worst sequels I've seen and I have seen a lot. 1/10 Bethany Cox",

It's bad, but it's not *that* bad. It makes little sense, though to be fair it is from a franchise that is all about a huge human-killing shark; despite sharks, in fact, not actually being all that keen on our rotten flesh.\n\nMichael Caine is somehow in this. Well, I say somehow... a trip to the Bahamas and a nice paycheck likely made it entirely logical from his view; as he reportedly stated himself. Lorraine Gary, meanwhile, spearheads an average support cast. Speaking of whom, I did find their dialogue and interactions to be very unnatural and forced.\n\n2*.

But the studio was in a bind from the previous year that you can read about it online. Mostly the studio and the people involved making it laughed at the idea that they were trying to beat the clock with only five or six months from being released. They weren't prepared. Shocking as that sounds, they didn't have any time to think things through. When the movie came out, it shows that they acted from the director Ed Wood, with only one or two shots and they had a produced film that wasn't even 90 minutes. Run, gun, and get it done. Everyone can complain about the shark, or how terrible the dialogue was. Reading the book of this film made it more substantial and they should've included that part from the book's perspective. They knew they were in a bind, but hopefully could make it work. When you watch the film, the majority of people knew it was bad, so they tried their best at it. Now, given that I've seen the movie multiple times, little kids will love it. Adults will chuckle at how bad it is, and it ends with a climax that's all over the place. I admit, I can tell what they were thinking of...but they shouldn't have included scenes from the first film to counteract with what they were representing in the fourth film. It's in poor taste. Yet, I found myself enjoying this movie for a lot of reasons. The opening with the deputy, the ongoing battle with the shark, and hearing Michael Caine going, \"Oh sh*@!\" The shark goes after a banana boat, the iconic music score, and JAWS goes after a plane. The idea taken from the book that it's two sharks is quite ideal. One was upstate only they have a voodoo priest call upon terror with a new shark located near where they lived. Why they didn't include this scene it would've made it more tolerable in the long run. As the franchise killer, it was terrible then and more terrible now. If they explained that Lorraine Gary was out of her mind and hearing things, it'd be okay. But I think we will get a reboot of this franchise. Call it JAWS: MERCY. It would be a complete antonym for the damage they caused with the Revenge as title. As a movie, I can honestly say I can watch it over and over. But as a good movie, it's not definitely not that.

The director of this movie actually said the reason it was so dumb is because they were thinking they should use a little tiny bit of magic or something like that since they knew it would never be as good as the original so they wanted it to be as unique as possible, and not to mention they were given barely anytime to make the movie which probably added to some of it's glaring flaws, the ost is amazing tho definitely my favorite arrangement of the iconic theme song.

I mean compare it to Superman IV: The Quest For Peace!\nMichael Caine makes a career defining appearance that achieved it's objective of paying for a new holiday home!\nI started by watching the trailer on You Tube. Any trailer that has a Blondie song 'One Way or Another' as the soundtrack is funny.\nThat was how I approached the film. Funny.\nNot as a major comparative piece of the merits of the first film (which it does allude to with pictures and discussions mentioning Chief Brody (Roy Schieder).\nThe main sticking point regarding this film is the thought of a Great White Shark travelling thousands of nautical miles to the warmer climes of Florida to just get revenge on the Brody family! The sheer thought is preposterous!\nThe film was made super quick in 1986/87 in an era before CGI and it shows. The models of the shark are awful. A primary school student could do as good a job to be fair.\nThe sequence at the start of the film where young (new) Chief Sean Brody is mauled is quite good and bodes well for the rest of the film.\nGoing back to 1987. It was a great year for sequels of major franchises!

How could there be any pretense that this was going to be a good movie when the poster tag line is, \"This time it's personal.\" How is a shark going to take things personally from the prior three films? And when the shark got killed in all of the prior films, is this film's shark supposed to be the third cousin twice removed coming to get revenge on Chief Brody's wife (the only person from the original film appearing in this fourth installment).

There is one version of this movie where they stab the shark and the shark explodes, for no reason, he just explodes. There is also another version where boat pierces the shark and blood is flying everywhere. I prefer the original ending. Sure it looks, funny and cheap, but it makes sense, except the retard roar part. Worst things in this movie are that in Jaws (1975) you never saw the shark, it was scarier that way. In this movie, the shark comes once in awhile and you see the wires holding the shark prop. The worst thing in this movie is the fact that Roy Scheider dies. The coolest characters of the series and you kill him off, come on. Instead watching this piece of garbage, watch Steven Spielberg's Jaws and other Spielberg film like Indiana Jones or Schindler's List. It's also abomination to Michael Caine, because he missed the Oscars because he was filming this, because that year he won an Oscar.",

The movie got a lot of criticism and has many plot holes, and I must agree it's my least favorite one of the series. The ending is just ridiculous. It was nominated for 7 Razzie awards (bad movies). The original theme song and some flashes of Roy Scheider from the first movie were used. Next to Gary we see the respectful Sir Michael Caine (The Dark Knight Trilogy, The Prestige)and Lance Guest (Halloween 2, The Last Starfighter). Who's in for a swim? \n\nNow that Martin Brody has passed away after a heart attack, his son Sean has stepped into his shoes as a police deputy. A few days before Christmas Sean has taken a boat to clear a log from a buoy, but is surprised by a great white shark that tears of his arm. The man dies, leaving his mother Ellen (Gary) devastated and convinced that the shark has targeted her family.\n\nEllen is invited by her other son Michael (Guest) to come and spend some time with him, his wife Carla and daughter Thea at their home in the Bahamas. She agrees. On her way, she meets airplane pilot Hoaggie (Caine) to who she develops a friendship. But what Ellen feared, seems to be real. The great white shark has followed her to the Bahamas and has only one thing in its mind: to devour the Brody family...",

The characters are bland and forgettable once again and their acting is just bad and none of them had any sort of charisma at all on screen. The only people that have ever done great in a Jaws film were Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss, their characters were the only ones you actually cared and rooted for. I can't believe that this film actually killed Roy Scheider's character off screen. But the biggest problems with this horrible disaster lie within the story, plot, and special effects. The story and plot are just really really stupid and highly unrealistic and the special effects are as bad as they could possibly get in a movie with a shark in it. Also whenever the shark would be eating somebody, the film would go into extreme depths of terrible as hell camera work where there are so many quick cuts that you could never figure out what was going on. There was just no thought put into anything at all and you know that the filmmakers just didn't care and the only thing they try to get out of this production is an easy paycheck. Another thing is that this was the most boring Jaws film ever and I kept waiting and waiting and waiting for something even remotely interesting to happen, but nothing interesting ever did happen. Michael Caine is a fantastic actor and here he is incredibly wasted and the movie never allows him to unleash his great acting talents. I had thought that Jaws 3 really sucked, but this movie manages to suck even more and in the end the film goes down in history as one of the worst films of all time. I am so glad that I am finally done watching and reviewing all of the unnecessary Jaws sequels and when I want to watch a Jaws film again, I will just go back to the 1975 classic where there were filmmakers that actually put thought and devotion into their work.",

A vengeful shark just can't happen nor should it because the idea is idiotic anyways.  Add the bahamas in the mix and you have stupidity that makes a shark look more like a dolphin.  So right off the bat the movie is circling the drain.  Only element that kept it from drowning immediately were the gasps of air in the human drama from a decent cast.  It involves a familiar family with a history of shark attacks.\n\nThe shark action is a complete failure.  Nothing about em are exciting or remotely coherent.  When no one is getting eaten (which is most of the time btw), we get badly shot close calls.  Total body count is a whopping 2 people.  The shark manages to look more fake than its 1975 counterpart.\n\nOverall the cast is good and totally wasted on a completely dumb concept and an even worse execution.",

Michael Caine is a great actor, and he does try his best in everything, I liked his role of Hoagie in this.

Jaws: The Revenge isn't one of the greatest horror films, it most certainly isn't as good as the first Jaws film, but atleast I was entertained by it.\r\n \r\nI have seen some truly terrible movies that are worse. (I.E.: The Garbage Pail Kids Movie, Manos: The Hands Of Fate, The Titanic cartoon with the rapping dog in, and some of the shitty spoof films made by Friedberg and Seltzer - Disaster Movie, Epic Movie, Meet The Spartans, etc.) I would rather re-watch Jaws: The Revenge, than re-watch any of these crappy films again, or any horrible film full of graphic violence and rape.

I also never realized that the Nintendo game was actually based off of the plot of this film, which I don't really get. This movie isn't even a \"so bad it's good\" kind of movie. It's just bad. Boring and meandering, with very little interesting things in it. It's also funny that they call it Jaws, despite the fact that Jaws was killed in the first film. Oh well. You know how sequels can be. We'll do whatever we want. That's the mentality of this horrible, horrible film. Now, does it tarnish the Jaws legacy, as in the first film? No, because no one really cares about it so it has no power over that film at all, and that's a good thing. Just ignore it and you're likely to ever forget that it existed.",

Now I can really see why this film sunk the franchise for good, as it is easily the worst Jaws film, period (And this is coming from someone who is a die hard fan of Jaws 2 and even salvaged Jaws 3 for camp value). Still, I wanted to give this film another chance before writing it off for good, and sadly, it still sucked. Now let me explain why.\n\nThe plot mostly focuses around Ellen Brody, the wife of Chief Brody from the first two films. After her son, Sean, is killed by a shark, Ellen becomes convinced that her family seems to be cursed and will be endlessly pursued by this new Great White until it finishes off her family for good.\n\nDespite her new fears, she decides to go to the Bahamas with her son, Mike, and his family to get her mind off her grief and even meets a charming pilot while she's there, whom she grows close to romantically. But, her worst fears are confirmed when the shark starts to come after Mike and his family, and now Ellen must do everything in her power to take down this shark.\n\nHonestly, even though some of the ideas are hokey, the premise of Jaws: The Revenge sounded really interesting. I also admired the fact that it tried to go back to the roots of the original film and also tried to be more dramatic. Had the story been properly written and the film had been directed properly, it could have made for a hell of a drama mixed with harrowing shark attack scenes, and peppered with just the right amount of 80's cheese to make for a damn good Jaws film to close out the franchise. It could have been a thrilling, harrowing, and terrifying film, but it sadly didn't work out.\n\nAs a drama, this film falls flat on its face thanks to a poorly written script which drowns its talented cast in a sea of cliches, flaccid emotions, and unrealistic scenarios. Worse yet, the film can't even be salvaged as trashy fun because shark attacks are few and far between, and what does happen doesn't get interesting until the final confrontation (Which results in a bizarre and unintentionally funny death. The shark not only explodes when the boat rams it, but it also causes the boat to explode into pieces). It's a bad drama and it's also a crappy shark film that can't be salvaged for camp value.\n\nI do feel, however, that the cast did their best with the material and I really enjoyed the performances by Lorraine Gary and Michael Caine who I felt managed to deliver even in the midst of so much awfulness.\n\nIn the end, Jaws: The Revenge is a disappointing conclusion to the franchise that is filled with a lot of interesting ideas that it never utilizes. The direction is bad, the story is crap, and the shark attacks are disappointing and filled with bad special effects. It's a probably a good thing they never made another Jaws film again because it would cause too much pain to fans to have to endure another one.",

            "content": "Someone should probably exact revenge on Joseph Sargent for making this, the most terrifying \"Jaws\" of all, but not in a good way. Where \"Jaws\" influenced blockbuster filmmaking, \"Jaws 2\" influenced inferior obligatory-feeling sequels and \"Jaws 3\" influenced lame 3D gimmick third installments, about the only thing that this film seemed to influence was Sci-Fi Channel original films. I broaden that statement to include all Sci-Fi Channel original films, rather than just the killer shark Sci-Fi films in particular, because just about all of the films Sci-Fi produces seem to be about bad CG sharks. Seriously though, it's a shame that the series has come all the way down to this point, but hey, at least this film makes for the worthy wrap-up to a certain aspect in the series' progression, because where we started with a 100% critical approvement of the first \"Jaws\", with this, the final installment, we've finally brought things down to 0%. I think that this film was doomed when it came to the concept, and by that, I don't mean that the film was doomed once it thought that it would be a good idea to have a shark understand and take advantage of the concept of revenge (\"This time, it's personal\"... It's a shark, tagline guy!), I mean that the film was doomed once it decided to not have the shark don a yellow jumpsuit, whip out a samurai sword and track down the man responsible for almost killing him on his wedding day. Granted, \"Kill Bill\" came out almost two decades after this film (Quentin Tarantino's such a nostalgiac that he makes stories that pay homage to B-movie stories that never happened), but the point is that if this film was going to go that far stupid, then I would have to give it credit just for being so gutsy. ...No, it would have been worse, because, really, sarcasm aside, this film isn't even close to as bad as people are saying it is, yet make no mistake, it's still pretty bad, and no matter how amusing this film's stupidity gets or how undeniably charming Michael Caine is (Yeah, I say, \"undeniably\" as though we can expect anything less from Michael \"Definitive Charming Englishman\" Caine), nothing can save this film, which isn't to say that there aren't \"some\" things in the actual final product that tried.\r\n\r\nOkay, now, I think that we can all ever so easily agree that not one of these sequels' scores have ever come close to touching John Williams' master work for the original, and yet, unexpectedly and undeniably, well, let me struck down if I don't think that this sequel came the closest. Granted, this film's score is a bit conventional, as well as used fairly rarely, yet when it does finally kick on, I did find myself won over, as Michael Small's adjustments to Williams' original themes, while definately not an improvement, still boast plenty of lively intensity and sweep that's both neat to listen to and stays faithful to the film's, and by extenion, the series' themes. The film's action is limp, as I'll discuss further later on down the roard, yet that score work breathes a certain essence of life into such moments as the action sequences, decidedly not to where it raises the action to genuinely intense, yet still raises to a certain degree, nevertheless. Still, as I said, the score work is fairly underused, and between those moments of musical glory, we're going to need some compensation, and, of course, we don't get that compensation, though not through lack of trying... or at least I don't think so. Okay, now, Joseph Sargent clearly couldn't have had his heart too deeply in this project, neither as producer or director, or else the film would be considerably more competent, so this film doesn't quite have the inspiration that \"Jaws 3\" had on a few occasions, yet it does have the charming ambition that \"Jaws 3\". Sure, with more inspiration and less missteps, this film's ambition would have been more charming, and therefore more capable of saving this project, yet I can't help but admit that I felt some degree of appreciation towards Sargent's intentions, no matter how tremendously unrealized they ended up being, and it certainly helped that, well, this film isn't nearly as bad as everyone and his or her grandmother is saying, for although the film is a disaster, I was going in expecting a towering testament to ineptitude and ended up finding not much more than your usual run-of-the-mill '80s mess, hardly worthy of evoking something like \"The Garbage Pail Kids Movie\", or \"Troll 2\", or \"Battlefield Earth\", or other films that seem more worthy of being placed among the worst ever messily crafted. Still, make no mistake, this film is still a mess and a disaster, surprisingly coming close to passable, though not close enough, as it find itself pulled down more than just a few fatal flaws.\r\n\r\n\"Jaws 3\" presented CG that was truly abysmal, as well as a few practical effects that weren't quite as convincing as they probably should have been, yet what I didn't mention is that there were still quite a few production designs in \"Jaws 3\" that really were pretty decent, and certainly much more worthy of my appreciation after this film, for although CG has been removed and a few production designs are left standing as reasonably passable, on the whole, most of this film's practical effects fell flat, and when they seriously shouldn't, for although the more passable practical effects and, of course, Michael Small's score raise tension to a moderate degree, the laughable effects really do launch you out of this film and, certainly, the film's sense of conseqeunce. Still, it's not like you're ever truly invested in the story, because this really is a pretty bad screenplay, or at least the story that the script structures is. Many of this film's story concepts are pretty poor, and made all the worse in execution, as Michael de Guzman's screenplay goes riddled with cliches, uninteresting filler, holes, poor characterization, unbuyable character actions, unbuyable story actions and, of course, bad dialogue. Okay, maybe Guzman's screenplay isn't immensely inept, yet it does collapse into utter and sometimes glaring incompetence at every turn, and it's made all the worse by, well, \"a few\" poor acting jobs, for although there a couple of passable performances (Hey man, you've got to love Michael Caine, even if he is playing Michael Caine once again, just the way we like it; also, I must admit that I was digging the also immensely charming Mario Van Peebles), there are still quite a few performances that fall flat as bland, at best, which is a complaint to be had about \"Jaws 3\", yet there are a few more performances in this film that are just all-out bad, or if nothing else, obnoxious (Ah, that stupid little girl!). Still, at the end of the day, the performance that taints these waters the most is the key one off of the screen, for although I can appreciate Joseph Sargent's ambitions, seriously, come on man, you have to do something to fulfill ambitions, rather than contradict them. Outside of providing mild charm through ambition, Sargent's direction does very little, if anything to carry this film past its flaws, or even spark the film in the first place, for although it was blandness that made \"Jaws 3\" so mediocre, yet also saved it from collapsing any lower, here, we're presented with more blandness that really does bear down on the film, rendering it disengaging, though not so disengaging that you don't still notice the many, many flaws that bypass the potential for mere mediocrity amidst the blandness and leaves the film to collapse as both laughable and dull, and grow more so in progression. The film starts out, not necessarily strong, but fair, then proceeds to progressively decline in quality quite considerably as its blandness grows more and more intense and its flaws grow more and more pronounced, until by the end, I found my time wasted and a film in disastrous ruins, for although this film isn't nearly as incompetent as I'm making it sound, and certainly not nearly as incompetent as everyone else is making it sound, it is nevertheless still consistently incompetent, and through all of Sargent's charming ambitions and Michael Small's actually pretty good score work, it's the incompetence that ultimately prevails, thus leaving this film, and by extension, the film franchise that started out strongly to finally sink.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the occasional fine score piece livens things up, while Joseph Sargent's palpable ambitions spark a certain undeniable charm within this film that makes it difficult for me to dislike the film, which isn't to say the flaws helped in my dismissal of the final product, for although the film isn't nearly as inept as many are saying, it remains incompetent, with shoddy technical value landing a blow to consequence, while a poor story ultimately slays the compellingness, and does so with the help of a poor screenplay, executed generally blandly and occasionally a smidge poorly by the cast, as well as Joseph Sargent's direction, which offers plenty of blandness and not enough compensation, thus leaving dullness to set in and help in ultimately making \"Jaws: The Revenge\" a sloppy and unworthy major misstep that may be considerably better than it's said to be, but is still pretty bad.\r\n\r\n1.5/5 - Bad",

Entonces ¿que resentimiento puede tener este tiburón con la familia Brody? \n\nLa segunda razón es el clímax del final.Ellen se va en un bote, lista para enfrentar a la bestia.A medida que el tiburón nada hacia ella, ella comienza a tener recuerdos de la escena icónica de la película original,cuando su marido disparó,con valentía,al tanque en la boca del tiburón y salvó el día.Ella recuerda vivamente esta escena,a pesar de que ella no estaba allí cuando sucedió.La belleza de la escena, sin embargo, es el momento en que el tiburón salta fuera del agua, sólo para ser arponeado y luego explota ... sin ninguna razón. No tanque de gas.No hay explosivos.Sin necesidad de cableado eléctrico. El tiburón explota debido a que fue apuñalado.\n\nLa última razón es tal vez el más simple de los detalles,pero uno grande,no obstante.El tiburón ruge con un gruñido de T-Rex-,pero los tiburones no tienen cuerdas vocales. \nUnas fallas extra: la falta de muertes y suspenso.\n\nHagan los cálculos.

I might as well believe the shark got to the Bahamas by plane, but his flight was landed early due to snow, and he had to travel with an irritating John Candy to the Bahamas, by plane and truck, along the way learning that sometimes the most different of people, can become the best of friends... then he ate John Candy. It would make no difference. neither makes any sense. Also, Michael Caine is in it. (Is Hoagie really a name? It really shouldn't be. [Hoagie is a Pennsylvania area term for a submarine sandwich for those out of the loop. They might as well have named him Sandwich in my mind.]",

I'm not sure the credibility of any other series has fallen quite so far; from an Oscar-nominated masterpiece to possibly the cheesiest movie ever made, Jaws: The Revenge is simply another shameful attempt to cash in on the legacy. However, psychic sharks aside, Jaws: The Revenge is essential viewing and although it may be missing that special some-fin, Revenge must be witnessed as an amazingly amusing tail.",

            "content": "I can't seem to make myself give this movie a 00%, but I will say, while the movie itself sucked hardcore ass, I still think it isn't one of the worst movies I have ever seen.\r\n\r\nNow, this movie sucked, yes, & undeniably one of the worst movies ever made, but it's not the worst I've seen, & believe it or not, I was actually able to sit through it without any problems & I can actually watch it again, & again without getting pissed off at it (not that I would watch it again). The major problem with this movie other than the fake-looking \"Bruce\" (the shark), is how BORING it is! Now, I have yet to see the other two, mainly because every time I watched any of the Jaws sequels, I never got passed the first 10 minutes of them.\r\n\r\nPlot/Story: The story is cheesy, the plot is just referencing the first film & also seems to be pasting other stuff from other movies, & there are so many plot holes. And as the others have said, the plot is about the shark stalking & murdering the Brody family. Yes, the shark actually stalks the family that has killed it in the previous movies. But that's the least of this movie's problems.\r\n\r\nThe plot & story is also both illogical & makes little sense. Now, the one illogical thing this movie has is how the shark traveled from New York, all the way to the Bahamas. That's almost what...2000 km? The shark not only would have never made at the same time as the characters did, but it would have never even have had to make it in the first place, because, great whites don't like warm water! Now, I know some of you may know me for the fact that I'll take realism in a film, rub it in my ass cheeks & then toss it aside, but this film tries to portray a man-eating shark in a realistically fictional way, which doesn't work so well.\r\n\r\nThen there's the problem with Ellen. But that part I'll save for later, so don't forget it. And then there's the part where the shark follows Michael through an entire sunken ship labyrinth. A great white shark is too damn stupid to do such a thing. But that won't get in the shark's brain because apparently this shark now grew a brain that of a human intelligence! It THINKS of what to do next if it doesn't seem to get to it's victim!\r\n\r\nCast/Acting: Lorraine Gray came back to reprise her role as the wife of Martin Brody, & then we have Michael Caine, the supporting actor. But everyone else in this movie is forgettable. And the acting is extremely questionable. There are points where the actors play their parts right, but then they are in another scene where they seem to be acting like they've been doing some drugs.\r\n\r\nCharacters: Remember when I said above to not forget about the problem with Ellen Brody? Well here it is now. Ellen now became the more heroic character of the movie, but that's not her problem, the problem she has is how she is always paranoid, & worse of all, she is haunted by flashbacks of events that she was never present in! Such as the scene where her husband shot the shark dead in the first movie & where her son was murdered in the beginning of the movie. Her character is also boring, not doing much but freaking out & pretending to be fine. I don't even wanna get to the other pointless characters.\r\n\r\nMusic/Score: The score is just fine, almost as great as the first one's score, but the problem with it was that it sometimes got a little too dramatic & loud.\r\n\r\nSpecial effects: They sucked, ass. The shark looked way too fake, especially compared to how it was used in the first movie. And don't get me started on the scenes where the shark began to 'rise' out of the water. And the scene where the shark was finally killed, for that one frame of that second of the movie, you can see the cheap, primitive tool used. Don't even get me started on the idiotic scenes of how the shark began to roar. Yes, the damn shark roars like a lion or some other beast, which is completely illogical.\r\n\r\nChemistry: I felt lots of chemistry between Lorraine Gary & Michael Caine, that's pretty much it.\r\n\r\nDialogue: The dialogue in this movie is so poorly written & executed that I seriously wondered if the actors themselves questioned if they were supposed to be saying what they read in their scripts. It's just bad, plain out bad.\r\n\r\nFinal summation, this movie sucks, is boring, & one of the worst movies ever made, but not that I've seen. It was an unnecessary sequel.",

Michael Brody (Lance Guest) turns out to be a marine biologist. Not only is this convenient to the plot, but it ignores Jaws 3's idea of Mike being a SeaWorld worker...or something. Anyway, Ellen decides to go where no shark will bother her anymore......THE BAHAMAS! Not only is this a very poor decision, but the shark must've overheard this conversation, because when Ellen and family go to the Bahamas, not only does the shark follow them, but he gets there first. Terrific! When they get there Lorraine meets Hoagie and LOVE IS IN THE AIR. Being the great parents they are, Michael allows Thea (Judith Barsi) on a wonderful Banana Boat of FUN. This fun banana boat ends up to be a banana boat of...deadliness, as good old Bruce kills an innocent civilian. Ellen is SHOCKED. She goes to finish the shark once and for all in Jake's boat. Michael arrives and sees his dear wife holding Thea, who is in shock. And Michael finally (albeit by accident) says that he knew the shark was out there. So he goes with Hoagie and Jake in the magical airplane to find her. They do; and secure a safe landing on the water, by a revenge-seeking shark. Mike and Jake get out easily, but Hoagie takes his sweet-ass time and gets sunk along with the plane. But he manages to escape and gets on the boat; as dry as...well...someone who hasn't been in water. Jake then decides to put this...thing inside the shark to make him go absolutely nuts. I don't see how this would kill him, but whatever. So Jake goes to the edge...stick to feed it to him. The shark unexpectedly flies up to him and eats him all up. Of course, Jake didn't forget to put that device in the shark's mouth. So, Mike presses a button to make the shark go crazy. It makes the shark so crazy that it defies all logic and roars...like Spot from the Munsters. In fact, I think that IS Spot's roar. Wow. Anyway Ellen ignores Hoagie's warning to come about and goes straight for the shark, stabs him with the moat and the shark struggles on it and dies...I guess. When the shark falls into the water, it takes the boat with it and Ellen and co. fall out of the boat and then go back to shore, somehow. Then Hoagie flies Ellen to Amity and all is well! Two people died in this movie. Wow. \n\nNow, I've seen an alternate ending where the shark explodes when he hits the moat (?) and Jake survives. Whatever, either way this movie is so great and obviously not full of plot holes and errors.\n\nKicked off a star because I had to see Michael Caine dance.\n\nLovely lines:\n\"Sharks come and go, Ellen!\"\n\"ROAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR!\"\n\"We got us a great...white! Now we're gonna do some REAL research, boi!\"\n\"I have an irresistible urge to kiss you, Ellen Brody.\"\n\" I've always wanted to make love to an angry welder. I've dreamed of nothing else since I was a small boy.\"\n\"Dad died of a heart attack!\"\n\"No, he died from fear. The fear of the shark!\"\n\" If mediocrity were fat, you'd all be whales!\"\n\"I deliver laundry!\"\n\nWhat a great film.\n4/5",

            "content": "If there ever were proof of the law of diminishing returns, the fourth entry in the Jaws series is it. The original was a taut thriller that launched the career of one of Hollywood's most celebrated directors. By comparison, Michael Caine often looks as if he is incredibly upset to be missing his award ceremony in order to appear in this piece. Lance Guest and Mario Van Peebles frequently appear to be wishing to have better things to do, while Lorraine Gary frequently looks stoned in moments when she is supposed to look frightening.\r\n\r\nClearly, the budget spent on this film didn't go into the research, script, or mechanical shark. Exactly why Michael Brody and his pals are putting what are apparently tracking devices on conch shells is never explained. Perhaps any explanation they thought of was so incredibly stupid that they thought it best to give up. An alternate explanation of why Michael is working in the water was never thought of, either. The true Ed Wood moment of the film comes towards the end of the piece, when the shark rises out of the water, and roars at Elaine. This is the first time I've heard of sharks having vocal cords. Given the box office draw this stinker had, I suspect it will be the last.\r\n\r\nThe shark takes a real beating here, too. The reason the shark wasn't seen often in the original was because Spielberg noticed that if one put it in front of the camera for long enough, the audience would notice that it doesn't move like a real shark. In this edition of the Jaws story, not only do they keep the camera focused upon the shark for more than enough time for the audience to notice the model's flaws, in so doing they make it crystal clear that this shark was made on the cheap. There are some shots in which the support structure of the shark is visible under the outer layer. There is even what appears to be a seam in the back of the shark's main fin.\r\n\r\nTo its credit, Jaws: The Revenge is well-photographed. While the 2.35:1 frame is often sparsely populated, depth of field is used with great effect in several shots. The fact that even frames with one character in them won't make sense when cropped to fit analogue television is a credit to the director and cinematographer. If only this kind of workmanship could have been seen in other aspects of the film.\r\n\r\nAnother area where Jaws: The Revenge deserves due credit is the score music. While the score is very much inspired by that which John Williams provided for the original, it distinguishes itself and genuinely works in its own right. In fact, one could almost say that the score music is more than the rest of the film deserves. The music is literally able to inject dramatic tension into scenes that, by all rights granted under the accepted rules of film-making, really shouldn't have any.\r\n\r\nWhen all is said and done, I gave Jaws: The Revenge a one out of ten. It works as a comedy in the sense that it is a stinking pile of crap, but there are precious few moments when the people making it seem privy to the fact. As a result, the film winds up in a class all of its own. It's not just so bad its good, it is so utterly bad it is incredible.",

Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary), widow of Amity Island shark killing Sheriff Martin Brody (Roy Scheider, who is notably absent save scenes culled from the original; if the actor saw this script, he certainly was wise to pass on it!), thinks that the shark is out to get her and her family.  After yet another incident at Amity, the same shark apparently goes so far as to pursue her to her son Michael's Bahama island home.  Is that enough for you?  It's just getting started.  Forget that Brody blew up the previous sharks in the first two films - and it's not entirely clear, if it matters at at all, if anyone remembers the third movie - but, apparently, someone's out for revenge.  While it might seem like it should be Ellen Brody out for blood, it appears that this movie is really about the shark taking revenge.  Maybe it's P.O.'d for how the Brodys have treated its relatives?   There are so many absurd elements present - and Michael Caine does his best to play it straight - I watched it from beginning to end with a smile and laughed out loud at times.   If I was grading this as a comedy, it would probably be a three star one.   So I wonder when someone is going to reimagine this series?  Please don't.  Watch the original.

Do you know WHY this story is well-known in the film community? Two words: tragic irony. At the same time he's winning the most prestigious award in the film community, he is off making what is generally accepted as one of the worst movies of all time.
