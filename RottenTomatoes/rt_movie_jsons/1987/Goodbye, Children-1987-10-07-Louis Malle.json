When three new students arrive, including Jean Bonnett (Raphael Fejto), Julien believes they are no different from the other boys. What Julien doesn't know is that the boys are actually Jews who are evading capture by the Nazis. While Julien doesn't care for Jean at first, the boys develop a tight bond -- while the head of the school, P\u00e8re Jean (Philippe Morier-Genoud), works to protect the boys from the Holocaust.",

Written by Malle based on his own experiences as a child, the movie takes its time unravelling the identity of young Jean Bonnett (Raphael Fejto), building suspense subtly and ultimately leading to its devastating final scene.  Over his remarkable career, Malle made a handful of great films and while Au Revoir les Enfants may not be the best offering in his considerable oeuvre, it is certainly one of the most impactful and memorable.",

Indeed, the term melancholia feels remarkably appropriate even though much of the activity here depicted is joyous and playful. Despite offering such spirited recollections of French boarding school life, there is a perceptibly somber and even funereal undercurrent permeating the film which is, on the one hand, entirely appropriate, while on the other hand slowly draining to behold. This is, in other words, the type of film that you view, absorb, contemplate, put away, and then return to only seldomly when struck by a particularly sober and pensive frame of mind. Nevertheless, \"Au Revoir Les Enfants\" leaves an indelible impression on the viewer, reminding us of that twilight period in our own lives when confronting the end of innocence and the beginning of true wisdom.",

The ending of the film is what really stands out as the viewer hopes that the film will end on a positive note only to be heartbroken by the ending where the titular phrase is said. Only problems I had with the film was that some parts of it dragged on especially the wood scene but other than that Au Revoir, Les Enfants is a very touching and moving film. I was surprised that it was nominated but did not win Best Foreign Language Film so I hope to watch the Danish film that did win in the future. I also thought it deserved to win the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay as opposed to the other nominees, Radio Days, Broadcast News and, the winning film, Moonstruck (haven't seen Hope and Glory).",

            "content": "Malle's greatest success in Au Revoir les Enfants is his establishment of perspective; for much of the film, the setting, characters, and plot are all limited to the boarding school lifestyle that would have been at the forefront of his protagonist's mind. There are intermittent glimpses of a larger world looming outside of Julien's field of vision, but they are only hinted at as secondary characters - soldiers dining in a stupor at a restaurant where he is reunited with his mother, for instance - but they are very much established as vague accessories to the atmosphere, until they all come crashing in at a pivotal moment where a greater world is revealed with devastating effect. My initial thought was that the characters and relationships were a bit simple, but thinking back it makes sense given the childlike, early adolescent point of view that the film establishes so clearly. Too many films take the tactic of using a child's perspective as a means of depicting a traumatic event, but Malle actually lends authenticity to the world rather than feeling condescending or cheap. Comparing this to the exuberant, positive philosophical musings of My Dinner with Andre certainly would seem to suggest a depth of character and visionary range that few directors can really be said to possess.

While there were cultural differences that I found a bit odd, it was an accurate depiction of how young boys act to this day, particularly when there is no adult supervision around. I loved how it showed the gradual formation of friendships as well. Even when kids don\u2019t like one another at first they can form a bond. It\u2019s never something that boys would talk about, but we see it from the way they behave with one another. There are a number of scenes that show the development of the relationship between the two main characters, and I thought that made the rest of the movie work on a narrative and emotional level. The film is slow-moving, particularly because it takes the main character a long time to figure out what is happening. We can deduce what the priests are doing with young Bonnet early in the film, but it takes much longer for Julien to catch on. Once they have established the story I instantly knew the stakes, because it only takes a basic knowledge of WWII to understand. They utilize these stakes for some great climactic moments in the final act, and a devastating emotional scene or two in the end. I was quite impressed with the acting from these young boys, because they all did a great job and it\u2019s typically a challenge to find even one good child actor. Au Revoir les Enfants is the kind of movie that I\u2019m glad I watched, but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll watch again. It is a well-made film, though, and deserving of all the awards attention it received.",

            "content": "This French WWII film confines Nazis and freedom fighters to the background in deference to a segment of the population that is typically relegated to one-dimensional supporting roles: children. It is a fresh point of view, and one with many potential pitfalls, but Louis Malle's careful execution and commitment to truth carry it through. Basing the story on his own experiences at a Catholic boarding school in Nazi-occupied France, he draws on detailed memories of the cruelty and naivety of children. The students in \"Au Revoir Les Enfants\" are not precocious, like so many movie youths, but they do have individual talents and interests, and they enjoy pretending to be sophisticates. They try to talk dirty, they exaggerate their experiences, and they pretend not to miss their parents when all they think about privately is how they long to be with them. They all have problems and insecurities, as well, that expose them to the insensitive taunts of their peers. One boy has night terrors, one is anemic and faints during mass, and the protagonist is a bed-wetter.\n\nBut these are nothing compared to the dangerous secret that some boys are hiding. The lead boy, Julien, whom a teacher describes as intelligent and a bit pretentious, reluctantly befriends a new student, Jean. They share a love of reading, but Julien resents the fact that Jean is a smarter than he and more of a teacher's favorite. Jean is sensitive, and therefore an easy target, so Julien quickly discovers his weak point. But he withholds the valuable information, recognizing its importance without fully understanding its meaning: Jean is Jewish, taking refuge in the school under a false name.\n\nIt is hard to find your way to this movie without knowing that key plot point, so even before it comes to the forefront Malle begins exploring it through artful verbal and visual cues. Early on, two students in the schoolyard pretend to be knights engaged in combat. One of them, secretly Jewish, chooses to play the part of a Saracen knight. The other students call him an infidel, and only Jean cheers for him. But such moments of agency in which Jean can express his identity without outing himself are few. More often, he is at risk of appearing different because of things he cannot do: he cannot recite the Hail Mary and other prayers with the rest of the students, cannot eat pork when it is offered, and cannot receive communion.\n\nThe communion scene is particularly interesting because it shows the limitations of the school headmaster's charity. After delivering a ringing sermon to wealthy parents about the need to give generously to those in need, Jean comes to the front to receive communion. The headmaster passes him over since he knows Jean is not a Catholic. The moment might have been too-on-the-nose but for the interesting questions it raises. Does Jean intend only to strengthen his disguise by joining in this ritual? Does he do it to better fit in with his peers, and to get closer to his friend Julien? Or, as I tend to think, does he do it because the headmaster's sermon has deeply moved him? In any case, this is one of several moments that make us wonder whether the headmaster could have done more to keep his Jewish charges safe.\n\nAnother is the decision that brings about the end of the ruse. The students and teachers gather to watch Charlie Chaplin's \"The Immigrant\" (a 27 year-old film, but there is a war on and it is a religious school). Images of The Tramp and a woman sliding around a rolling ship give way to Malle's shots of a brawl on icy pavement between the school's cook and crippled kitchen boy. The boy, perhaps 18 years old, has been running a black market in preservatives, so the headmaster fires him. In retaliation, the boy notifies the local Gestapo that the school is harboring Jews. The headmaster is a hero who shelters Jews at the risk of his own safety, yet his incomplete committal to his espoused principles creates an opportunity for his work to be undone. Still, he falls gracefully. He courageously delivers the titular farewell when he is marched off to share the Jewish students' inevitable fate-a fate Malle has foreshadowed in a tense but beautiful forest sequence midway through the film.\n\nThe movie's Nazis are one-note, but this is not a problem so long as they are kept in the background. When they show up in force at the end, they indulge in a bit too much leering and mustache-twirling for a film that is primarily interested in the hypocrisy and indifference of the French rather than the blatant barbarism of the Germans. But nothing diminishes the impact of the film's final lines, which are delivered almost without emotion in a voice-over by an adult Julien. The window on the atrocities of WWII that he had as a child was a narrow and privileged one, and his understanding of them was imperfect, but the sudden and permanent loss of a friend became a searing and defining memory for him. By looking at the period and place through a child's eyes, Malle demonstrates that no amount of insularity or innocence could keep one blind as to what was happening to Europe's Jewish population.",

There is a memorable scene at a restaurant where French fascists accost an elderly Jewish patron and tell him he isn't welcome. He is told by some German soldiers to continue on with his meal. There were many shades of grey in this terrible war  Many French had deep rooted feelings of antisemitism and it was quite common for them to help the Germans round up Jewish people. Hiding or helping Jewish people was considered a high offense and people often paid with their lives. The movie is semi autobiographical. Louis Malle attended the school in the movie during wartime. \"Au Revoir Les Enfants\" is a joy to watch.",

A few new boys arrive rather mysteriously and one stands out immediately for his manners, etiquette, intelligence, creativity, sensitivity, and above all abject humility and appreciation for being there. For the first half hour of the film he is relentlessly bullied but he never complains, so grateful he is for being there. He is bullied because the other boys suspect he is different somehow and/or because of some sort of hazing philosophy. For the most part the bullying against him stops as more and more he impresses the other students with his skills and personality. Eventually , one of the young employees, another boy, gets fired for stealing food to resell on the black market, and in his wrath he snitches on the school to the Gestapo. It turns out the new students are secretly Jewish, and the Gestapo descends with full fury despite the fact, that by now it is certain Germany will lose the war due to the heavy Russian advance. Meanwhile, the exceptional Jewish boy has become, and in a very heartwarming gradual way, best friends with a catholic boy, who we assume represents the future director of this film. 3 boys, along with the head of the school are marched off to die in Auschwitz.",

            "content": "Man, this film's title is so straight-forward that its French title is incredibly easy to translate: \"Goodbye, You Dirty Jew\". Hey, the title may as well translate as that, because this is yet another reminder of how the Jews just couldn't catch a break a break during WWII, which was so bad for Jews that even boarding schools had to give them a break. I can't help but feel as though if you were to get all of this Nazi stuff out of the picture, then the story would still figure out a way to work in anti-Semitism, because it seems like most every film about a Jew in a private school, or prep school, or boarding school, or whatever involves a bunch of students hating the Jew's guts for some reason. I don't know about y'all, but I was on the edge of my seat throughout this film, expecting for that one scene in which Rapha\u00ebl Fejt\u00f6's Jean Kippelstein character gets found out, slurred out, then stands outside of the school in the rain, shouting, \"L\u00e2ches!\" (It's a \"School Ties\" joke, for those of you who are too lazy to get on Google Translate), you know, up until the Nazis picked him up. Jeez, and the only thing Brendan Fraser had to worry about was getting kicked out of his group of friends, and on top of that, his David Greene character had the fortune of being in a film that people actually saw. Yeah, this film wasn't likely to be box office gold, and not just because my having to come up with a reference to \"School Ties\" - which wasn't even released by 1987 - as something to look forward to reflects that this film doesn't have as much excitement as you might hope. No, people, this film isn't that slow, being genuinely decent by the end, but the fact of the matter is that this film, like non-Jewish students in a boarding school, has some obvious issues.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it should pretty much go without saying that this story of companionship and protection during the most dangerous of days is a worthy one, but through all of the thematic weight, this premise is pretty thin, with only so much kick in dramatic structure, as emphasized by such things as the expository shortcomings that render the final product not as fleshed out as it probably should have been, and, of course, atmospheric dryness. The film is not so disengaging that it's not, on some moderate level, compelling enough to be likable, but this film slows down a lot, and taints such slow spells with a quiet meditation upon atmosphere in a fashion that is blandly disengaging, and often just plain dull. Atmospheric kick is very limited in this film, whose dullness is considerable enough for the final product to come close to plummeting out of likability that is ultimately secured, but challenged by dryness in the air that is easily this film's biggest problem, and one that emphasizes pacing issues that were on paper to begin with. This film really isn't that long, but like I said, its story is thin, and only so much material can be added into this film before things begin to get excessive, with fatty filler around the edges and somewhat irritating repetition that are ultimately more prominent than they should be in this character study that actually requires some filler in order to flesh itself out. The film takes time explore certain areas of depth within its characters, but it does so in too steady of a fashion that is anchored by fatty storytelling, made all the more disconcerting by atmospheric dull spots that settle the kick of plot structure, until it is thinned out almost into obscurity, thus resulting in a kind of aimless feel that leaves this meditative piece to meander about as much as it effectively draws depth. In terms of quantity, there's not a whole lot that's wrong with this film, but when it comes to the degree to which this film's issues slow down momentum, aimless bloating and a generally dry atmosphere do a lot of damage to this film, which was held back enough by natural limitations that could have been bypassed enough for a gripping film to be crafted, yet are ultimately emphasized by the consequential issues that make the final product an underwhelming one. Still, no matter how much the film falls short, it doesn't fully plummet out of decency, which is shaken time and again, yet ultimately stands strong on the foundation of tasteful artistry, even of a photographic nature.\r\n\r\nA 1987 film that is stuck with an unknown, but undoubtedly airtight budget, this film is by no means all-out stunning, but it nonetheless looks surprisingly very handsome, as cinematographer Renato Berta plays with a darkly bluish color palette in a tasteful fashion that emphasizes darker colors in a gritty, but attractive fashion that even goes so far as to resemble some kind of painting at times. Again, the film won't take your breath away, yet where it could have neglected to go an extra mile in visual artistry and taken on a blandly average look that does nothing to ameliorate an atmosphere that is blanded up enough in the storytelling department, it makes an effort to look good, and such tasteful artistry reflects the filmmakers' commitment to this subject matter, which deserves nothing less than inspired interpretation. Even outside of the battlefield, Europe during World War II was anything but completely safe, especially for the Jews, every one of whom had a distinguished story to be told, and not necessarily by them, because even though all of the names and most of the events have been changed, this film is based on a true story in the childhood of writer, producer and director Louis Malle, who, as a student at a Catholic boarding school, was unknowingly in the presence of Jewish refugees, whose companionships with those of a supposedly \"superior\" culture reflected a humanity that even the non-Nazis forgot about, thus making for a story that, while not all that eventful, holds plenty of value and the potential of being interpreted as a compelling film, something that this effort, to a certain degree, is. No, the film is not nearly as compelling it could have been, being too aimless and dry to be all that engaging or rewarding, but if you're patient, you can expect to find heights in storytelling that is consistently just inspired enough to sustain a reasonable degree of your investment, with Malle turning in a script that, while fatty around the edges, has plenty of areas of genuine characterization, while also turning in a directorial performance that, while messy in plenty of places, plays up soul as adequately engaging, sometimes even rather resonant. Sure, the moments in which the film finally finds its resonance are very much few and far between, yet they are here as particular heights in an engagement value that is not shaken into dissipation, but instead firm enough to make a decent character piece, further carried by inspiration behind the portrayal of these characters. Seeing as how there's only so much dramatic eventfulness in this film, there's only so much dramatic material for our cast of mostly young talents to work with, but most everyone of our young leads distinguish themselves with charisma that adds to much of the charm that gets this film by, and is occasionally broken up by a human heart that helps in defining this character-driven drama. As surely as there are only so much flaws, there are only so many strengths in this film, yet like the flaws, what strengths there are county, not so much so that you get glimpses of the truly strong drama that this had the potential of being, but nevertheless to where you end up with a decent drama, with taste, charm and heart that prove to be endearing to get the final product by, regardless of squandered potential.\r\n\r\nTo bid a fond au revoir of my own, natural shortcomings in the film's generally uneventful story are emphasized by expository thinness and atmospheric dryness, whose considerable blandness exacerbates the meanderings - spawned from draggy and aimless plot structuring - the make the final product underwhelming, but not so much so that the handsome cinematography, heights in writing and direction, and endearingly charismatic and genuine performances breathe enough life into the value of a worthy story concept to make \"Au revoir les enfants\" an adequately engaging character piece, even though it could have been so much more.\r\n\r\n2.5/5 - Fair",

It can be felt with a strong sense, for every second of this film. Malle does suggest a further stretch of imagination to understand it all early on in the film, and even more to realize it's brilliant scheme, but it's not even just it's construction either!

While this childhood friendship has just got fonder, they are now faced by this Nazi huntdown of which Jean is seeking the Catholic school's help for hiding. Julien, wise as he was beyond his years, was not prepared to embrace their friendship's fated tragedy. How devastating. :(",

            "content": "AU REVOIR LES ENFANTS (or Goodbye, Children, as it translates in English) is quite a terse film, and even more when it is considered that this has been known as the semi-autobiographical story of Louis Malle, who directed, wrote, and (without credit) produced it.  Its length, however, seems to have no impact on it as an emotional, empathetic visual story.  This film isn\u00e2(TM)t SCHINDLER\u00e2(TM)S LIST, mind you; it is in no way a long saga, nor does it briefly convey the experiences of millions of Jews who suffered from the Holocaust.  Instead, we have here an even more compelling and riveting story.  We feel even more sympathy when we learn to understand a character as a person, and eventually move to understanding his emotional reactions when he realizes he may never again see his best friend.\n\nHave you ever watched a film and almost immediately wanted to pop it back into the DVD player and watch it over again?  That\u00e2(TM)s the feeling I had when I watched AU REVOIR LES ENFANTS.  In fact, I realize as I\u00e2(TM)m typing this that it\u00e2(TM)s probably a film that would endure at least thirty consecutive viewings before it would grow tiring to watch.  I wouldn\u00e2(TM)t say I\u00e2(TM)m adamant when it comes to learning about the Holocaust, or even World War II in general, but this film especially gave me a step or two up from where I was regarding my interest in the subject.  That said, AU REVOIR LES ENFANTS is just a shade off absolute perfection.  The few scenes that manage to let go of your interest are what keep me from giving this five stars.  Nonetheless, it\u00e2(TM)s a film everyone should see.",

            "content": "Au revoir les enfants is a semi-autobiographical story from director Louis Malle who was born in 1932 and lived through many of the events depicted on the screen. Because it's based on the truth, it has added meaning for the viewer. It's about school, friendship, racism and regret.\n\nThe story begins with a 15-year-old boy, Julien Quentin (Manesse), leaving his mother and taking the train to a Catholic boarding school. The school is run by monks and all of the students are boys. It's set in the 1940s during the German occupation of France. A new boy, Jean Bonnet (Fejt\u00f6), takes the bed next to Quentin.\n\nMost of the students tease Bonnet and make his life a misery. As you have probably experienced, this is typical treatment for a new student in any school. In addition to the teasing, he finds that the water is cold, baths have to be taken in the local town, and air raids disrupt the lessons. Bonnet's life becomes more tolerable when a monk tells Quentin to befriend him without explaining why. After a while, Bonnet's ability in a wide range of school subjects such as music, math and French, earns Quentin's respect. The two become friends.\n\nThe portrayal of school life is realistic and reminds me somewhat of The 400 Blows. It gradually becomes clear that Bonnet has a secret. He claims to be a protestant and mentions that his father is a prisoner. Quentin searches Bonnet's locker and uncovers the secret, but he's not completely aware of its significance at the time. \n\nWhen his mother visits, Quentin persuades her to include Bonnet on a trip to a local restaurant. She likes him although he doesn't say much. While they are eating, we are shown a group of collaborators harassing a Jewish man who simply wants to have dinner. Jews are not allowed in the restaurant. Quentin is puzzled by this treatment and isn't even sure what a Jew is and why they should be hated.\n\nQuentin matures throughout the film and his awareness of events happening in his life increases. It's a coming-of-age tale of sorts, and the seemingly innocent existence of the students is overshadowed by something more sinister.\n\nThis sad tale will emotionally affect viewers who allow themselves to be drawn into the story. I can only imagine what Malle must have gone through in order to make it. Perhaps it was his way of confessing?\n\nI don't want to reveal anything more as it might ruin the experience for anyone yet to see it.\n\nActress Ir\u00e8ne Jacob made her film debut in the role of a piano teacher which ultimately led to her being noticed by director Krzysztof Kieslowski. As a result, he cast her in The Double Life of Veronique and Three Colors Red. Both films are essential viewing for film fans who enjoy stories encouraging thought and speculation.",
