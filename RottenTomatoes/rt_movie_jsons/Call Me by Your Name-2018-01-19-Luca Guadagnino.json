    "summary": "It's the summer of 1983, and precocious 17-year-old Elio Perlman is spending the days with his family at their 17th-century villa in Lombardy, Italy. He soon meets Oliver, a handsome doctoral student who's working as an intern for Elio's father. Amid the sun-drenched splendor of their surroundings, Elio and Oliver discover the heady beauty of awakening desire over the course of a summer that will alter their lives forever.",

Oliver is as despicable as he is in this movie and in real life. At least he played a role true to himself? The age gap is problematic and you know what? I'm gonna say it. I don't care that the culture and laws might be different in Italy. They're 17 and 24 and it's gross. Not only that, but Elio and Oliver only want one thing and it's so boring.",

            "content": "Not to single out this particular premise, but films revolving around gay couples have been terrific over the last decade or so. There was a spark when 2005's Brokeback Mountain was released, which eventually brought us to foreign films like Blue Is the Warmest Colour being nominated for a Golden Globe or Moonlight winning best picture at the Oscars. Call Me by Your Name is the latest film to probably receive many nominations in the coming months, and believe me, the praise is not false. Being a fan of 2015's A Bigger Splash, I was looking forward to Luca Guadagnino's follow-up feature film, and I believe this to be an improvement in the best ways. Exploring the hardships of life and what it means to just kick back and relax every now and then, Call Me by Your Name is a film that's been sticking with me since my viewing of it. While it admittedly won't be able to draw in everyone to the theatres, here is why I believe this to be a fantastic, award-worthy picture.\n\nWritten by James Ivory and directed by Luca Guadagnino, Call Me by Your Name follows a family that lets Oliver, an older graduate student, live in their home for the summer. While this is a common thing, what's not too common is that Elio, their son, will eventually grow romantic feelings toward this man, convincing him to become his lover for the summer. From the age gap between them and having to hide it from the family, their situation isn't an easy one, nor will it be for some audience members, but it really is a wonderful story. This is easily a story that could've stirred up controversy if it hadn't been done with taste, and because of how it was made, I just couldn't take my eyes off the screen. This was made entirely possible by the incredibly devoted performances by Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Armie Hammer.\n\nHammer has had his ups and downs through the years, appearing in Oscar-winning films as well as some of the worst films of the year, so his performance here was the most shocking to me. Yes, he's been talent in nearly everything he's been in, but he really gave his all in this performance and I honestly don't think he'll ever be better than he was in Call Me by Your Name. On the other hand, young Chalamet has a very bright future ahead of him. Being a relatively new actor, his chemistry with Hammer was impeccably astounding. Their relationship took a while to grow on me, but once it completely won me over, I found myself wondering if there was anything to really complain about.\n\nIf I had to complain about anything, it would be in its extreme pressure to try your patience. There are very long sequences of silence, making you relax and take in either a romantic moment or the scenery around them, which I also found poetic at the same time, so I actually have trouble coming up with issues, but I have to admit that I did find the movie slow at times. Yes, it's meant to be slow, which is why that complaint isn't exactly valid, but I just have to be honest.\n\nIn the end, this is a truly remarkable piece of dramatic filmmaking and there are some very memorable scenes that keep replaying themselves in my head. One scene in particular that involves Elio and his father Mr. Perlman (played magnificently by Michael Stuhlbarg) toward the end had me in tears. From the brilliantly written screenplay, to the poetic cinematography, to the terrifically calm direction, Call Me by Your Name isn't a movie that I would send the average moviegoer out to see, but if you're a hardcore film fan, I think you'll end up loving this movie.",

If I just wanted to look at nice Italian scenery I would buy some postcards.",

            "content": "Timothe\u00e9 Chalamet and Armie Hammer star in Luca Guadagnino's moving adaptation of Andre Aciman's bestselling novel. Dazzling performances and ravishing visuals propel \u2018Call Me by Your Name' into its place as one of 2017's best films.\n\nTimothe\u00e9 Chalamet stars as Elio, an artistic 17-year-old who spends his summer in the picturesque landscapes of Northern Italy, transcribing music and hanging out with his friends. Being on the cusp of adulthood, Elio also spends his days flirting with his friend Marzia (Esther Garrel) and experiencing love for the first time. His mundane routine is interrupted when American student Oliver (played by Armie Hammer) arrives to work with Elio's father (\u2018A Serious Man star Michael Stuhlbarg). As the summer progresses, Elio and Oliver form a fervent love, developing a passionate bond that will forever impact their lives.\n\nAmerican singer/songwriter Sufjan Stevens composed two original songs (\u2018Mystery of Love' and \u2018Visions of Gideon') and provides a remix of his own song \u2018Futile Devices'. Stevens' music accompanies a variety of songs ranging from classical music pieces to 80s pop songs. The mix of musical genres effortlessly compliments Sayombhu Mukdeeprom's cinematography that echoes the visuals of Joe Wright's 2007 drama \u2018Atonement'. Luca Guadagnino miraculously brings together first-class filmmaking to create a delicate, yet heart-breaking story with a poetic story at its centre.\n\nTimothe\u00e9 Chalamet and Armie Hammer bring their A games to \u2018Call Me by Your Name', both providing Oscar-worthy performances fuelled by intense chemistry between them. Chalamet's performance encompasses Elio's intelligence and artistic flair, while Hammer brings Oliver's suave and breezy persona to the screen. Michael Stuhlbarg gives a wonderful performance as does Amira Casar and Esther Garrel. Stuhlbarg's standout moment comes when he gives a touching monologue to Elio after Oliver's departure and \u2018to make yourself feel nothing so as to not feel anything' is a waste. However, Chalamet proves himself as a talented performer during the final scene as the credits roll beside him. His performance is a mix of discovering yourself and being a teenager, while also discovering love and how it feels. Both of which tie into some of \u2018Call Me by Your Name's complex themes of heartbreak, identity and coming-of-age.\n\n\u2018Call Me by Your Name' delves into intricate themes like the joy of love and with it the pain of loneliness that comes when you are without your significant other. The film also quite obviously explores themes of sexuality, and covers Elio's journey of self-discovery, an example being the infamous peach scene. Most likely unbeknownst to most of the film's audience is the fact that \u2018Call Me by Your Name' is the final instalment in Luca Guadagnino's Desire trilogy. The triad of films is also comprised of 2009's \u2018I Am Love', starring Tilda Swinton and 2015's \u2018A Bigger Splash', starring Ralph Fiennes, Dakota Johnson, and Matthias Schoenaerts alongside Swinton.\n\nLuca Guadagnino brings a passionate love story to the screen bound alongside a delicate coming of age tale. Brilliant craftmanship and a remarkable screenplay by James Ivory, come together to create a mesmerising viewing experience. The film is an elegant adaptation of Andre Aciman's novel, and it's uncommon to find a film as delicate as this one. Chalamet and Hammer give career-defining performances, never faltering across the 130-minute runtime.",

This movie is about basically a child molester, because he was a grown adult, having sexual relations with a child.

So at the end of the day, I'm not quite sure exactly how I truly feel about this movie, but I think this moving is something to touch on as an adult and realize that this is not great. But also, the only thing that I can rate is Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet's performance as this character, though was over the top and he did a wonderful job for trying something that I would not have been comfortable doing.",

The languid pacing suits the setting of a summer in in 1980s Italy and there are some lovely, deliberate and detailed touches in its symbolism, making it quite lovely in its commentary on the emotions of first love.",

With a different actor, I would have given 5 stars.\nHaving said that, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is exquisite. The ending scene with the close-up on his face while the music of Sufjan Stevens goes on is just sheer perfection. \nNote for the American audience: don't be shocked by the lack of moral disapproval from Italian movie-goers: in Italy the age of consent is 14.",

The setting is lovely - it's only described as 'somewhere in Northern Italy' and there's some relatively thoughtful dialogue present, although there are some scenes when the characters don't talk too often. I also enjoyed the classical/instrumental music often played in the background, which gives it a somewhat dream-like/floaty feel or sense. I particularly liked the light piano tunes, which had a bit of an ethereal sense to them at times. The characters seem very thoughtful and it's quite an atmospheric film. I would recommend it, yes.",

Timothee Chalomet and Armie Hammer both are naturally actors that are tough to like for me (for VERY different reasons mind you), but their work in Call Me By Your Name is pretty undeniably great. Much of the conflict in the movie is implied. It's legitimate conflict at that - acceptance of homosexuality in the 80s was obviously very different than it is now - but the amount to which this is only implied had sort of had a reverse effect on me where it seemed like the movie was overconsumed with what boiled down to \"rich white people problems.\" That coupled with Elio's (Chalomet) surprisingly indulgent and accepting family simply turns this into a summer romance movie. A very good summer romance movie...but something I truly only have so much patience for. Sufjan Stevens' music that's included is a great analog for the movie. Sufjan's music is great albeit being fairly twee. So unless I'm really there for it in the moment, there's only so much I can endure without grumbling to myself \"Okay, come on guy.\"",

What an emotional scene. I can barely remember her without tearing up my eyes. The most touching thing is that the story takes place in the 1980s, at a time when the theme the film deals with was not so addressed and well accepted among society and, especially, among families. And that's what makes the scene even more emotional, as Elio's father was completely selfless and ahead of his time. It certainly has become one of my all time favorite movies.",

But for Call Me by Your Name, I have to come out by watching it and review it to give my thoughts about it and just to make it clear, I am a hetrosexual, I love women because they're sexy and also, there's nothing wrong with g*y people. I'm not a h******bic and I am not a h**o. Now with that clears it, let's get with it. A Jewish Italo-French young man named Elio played by Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet lives with his parents in rural Northern Italy. Elio's father who is professor of archaeology, invites Oliver played by Armie Hammer, to live with the family over the summer. Elio spends much of the summer reading, playing piano, and hanging out with his childhood friends and of course, the gay romance begins. As I am going through this like I always do and so far, so good, I really enjoyed it. The story keeps you going and leaving you wondering what's going to happen next. The acting in this is brilliant, you can't really go wrong. Armie Hammer and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet have good chemistry together in this movie. So as far as I enjoyed Call Me by Your Name I still love lesbian films with g*y women but there's nothing wrong with checking this one out that is if you're interested. It's almost like I'm watching a foreign film with different language and subtitles so I can understand what the people are saying. Some of them are speaking different language and I get where this is going. So in all, I enjoyed this one. It had great acting, great story, great atmosphere and great shots. Even if you're gay or not I'd still say check this one out. I know I have. Oh, also there's a tribute at the end of the credits which says \"In loving memory of Bill Paxton\". So yeah, that is something. Call Me by Your Name is a great coming-of-age romantic drama.",

I'm not sure Arnie Hammer was the right choice of character, his brash Americanness jarred and made him largely two dimensional throughout the film. The recurring 'later,' was quite tiresome, and detracted from the smouldering that could have made the film much more interesting. There is a thin Jewish line running through the film; it was not a problem, but I don't think it added anything to the film. The narrative seemed to have a number of unnecessary back stories, which did nothing, the relationships with the women, perhaps helped set the tone of the time, but was inapposite. The session with the father at the end was nice, but not really very natural; there was no real build up to it, the father in many ways seemed somewhat distanced from Elio. The (colour) cast of the film was a little peculiar too; perhaps the bright Italian sun, but it was almost faded Kodachrome at times, and this did nothing for the film either. The continuous clumsy smoking (rarely seen in cinema today), might have been authentic, but it did not really have any point either, as it could have done. James Ivory has made some amazing films, but this one was not one of them. I suspect he is getting a bit old now -- as we all do. I was glad I saw this film, and I really wanted to like it, but it didn't hang together well enough for me.",

Call Me by Your Name is a coming of age film that follows Elio and Oliver's undeniable romance in Italy during the 1980s. \n\nI praise Luca Guadagnino's intricate mise en scene compliments for making the whole movie flow as a fantasy. The pastel tinted lighting ties in the watcher to create a dreamlike feeling. The lighting easily pairs with Crema's scenic nature within the film. The lighting and scenic nature really emphasize the feeling of an Italian summer. I felt just starry eyed viewing the film.\n \nThe placement of tasteful fruits, especially peaches, had me in awe while viewing the film. The peach scene signifies Elios realization of his sexuality which is a defining moment in the movie. Elio confesses that he loves Oliver right after his curiosity with the peach. I feel like the placement of a peach in such a vulnerable moment with Elio really leaves the watcher with a sense that the film is a lustful fantasy. \n\nSexual desire is not only shown through fruits, but also through water. There are multiple scenes including bodies of water. Elio and Oliver bike to a discrete pond, and splash in the pool while talking. In both instances they end up admiring each other's bodies which creates this strong attraction between Oliver and Elio. I really felt as if the desirable tension between Elio and Oliver throughout these scenes really emphasized the dreamy vibe developed in Call Me by Your Name.",

Chalemet's character was very hormonal and I found it a bit much for my taste. \n\nAs mentioned, the movie was a pure slice for life with subtle drama. Even though the two main boys were in mad love, they had to be secretive because not a lot of people tolerated the topic in 1983. Since I was pretty bored, I honestly didn't care much about the couple. \n\nEven though I didn't like the romance, I loved the music and the look of the town. Watching the beautiful scenery really made me want to live there, where I could enjoy the day with the calm music. \n\nOverall, despite how gorgeous the cinematography was, the romance didn't click it for me. 6/10",

Choosing to nitpick, I wasn't the biggest fan of the soundtrack, and the length could have been reasonably cut down in places; there were certainly a few somewhat odd moments that can be chalked up to the unique quirks of any given relationship - they can be either endearing or somewhat strange, depending on the viewer. Chalemet is the real star, slipping into his role like a second skin, but there are certainly no bad performances. As predicted, 2017 was the year of ... Michael Stuhlbarg? (4/5)",

Elio's parents starred alongside Chalamet and Hammer as their performance was impeccable. Now, I'll venture off into a purely personal and subjective opinion: the intellect in this movie is also genuinely a turn on. They all speak multiple languages, and the books and music they engage with alongside the beautiful landscape and weather make the whole movie so much more sensual. I just wish some emotions were better explained because this isn't a book and there isn't a narrator clarifying what the characters are feeling. However, as a whole, I loved this movie.

I feel this plays strongly to its advantage as it in no way feels preachy. Rather, it feels as though the filmmakers, who adapted this screenplay from a book of the same name, truly wanted to tell a genuine love story. This film has so many great scenes of dialogue and the imagery is alluring. In many ways this film immerses you into its story with great writing and strong performances, especially from Timoth\u00e8e Chalamet, and a delightful soundtrack. It's story is also very grounded which I always appreciate.

This creates lots of tension between the two characters from very early on in the film. As it progresses however, we begin to realize that this tension is not only just awkward silences of two people meeting for the first time, but it becomes more of a sexual tension that grows larger and larger. The scene sequence when Elio volunteers to go into town with Oliver is when we start to feel this type of tension. Right before they leave Elio sits on the side of the pool as Oliver swims. As they plan to go Oliver says something and Elio mocks him in an odd voice, this reveals that Elio is so much younger and more naive than Oliver, as their love story unfolds, we see this become more evident. They arrive into town and Oliver goes to buy a pack of cigarettes revealing his maturity. The way these two dance around each other for the majority of the film is frustrating yet amazing.

The film immediately places you \"somewhere in Northern Italy,\" and for the rest of the film you feel like you are right there in Italy, observing Elio and Oliver's blossoming romance. The performances from Timothee Chalamet and Armie Hammer really sell the love their characters have for each other during every scene. The relationship between Elio and Oliver seems truly authentic. Their shared awkwardness makes the relationship look real and spontaneous. This  is significant, as most romance movies do the exact opposite by shying away from realism. Possibly the best thing this film does is its use of non-diegetic sound to replace dialogue in a scene. The music in the film tells us more about the characters in that moment than any piece of dialogue ever could. Futile Devices plays during a scene early in the film, which corresponds to the early days of Elio and Oliver's relationship. The scene can be depicted as Elio missing Oliver, but also longing for something so much more, as in this scene Elio knows he's in love with Oliver. None of this is said or told to the audience, but conveyed through a short montage with just the sound of music playing over it. This film is important due to its representation of the LGBTQ+ community. Elio and Oliver are two men madly in love with each other in the 80's, and they are met with nothing but acceptance. Towards the end of the film, During a terrifically written and emotional monologue, Elio's father offers his son love, acceptance and support. Call Me by Your Name is profoundly endearing, and a must-watch for all viewers. It's a depiction of the hardships and serene moments of a beautiful romance that makes it an instant classic.",

The cinematography beautifully sets a scene for a flawless love story, but Elio and Oliver's relationship is complex and takes a while to fully blossom. In the beginning of the film the couple wasted time that they could have spent together in other relationships because they were worried about what other people would think. Elio pursued a relationship with a girl almost to spite his feelings towards Oliver, trying to channel his sexual frustration elsewhere, and as soon as the couple got together he ended his previous entanglement. What makes this movie so special is the intense buildup to the passionate but short-lived romance, because they knew they didn't have much time together before Oliver inevitably returned home. When Elio arrives back from the train station in distress, his father comforts him and reassures him of one of life's most important lessons in his own words: \u2018Tis better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all. His father opens up about his own childhood and tells Elio that homosexuality was something that people wished away, and there was regret in his tone when he revealed that he was never able to experience a connection like Elio and Oliver had. Besides the ending by the fireplace that made it seem that Elio was upset, the conclusion of the movie had a nice message; some relationships can begin and end messily, but the important thing is that you grew from it.",

What the film sometimes lacks in direct dialogue, it makes up for in beautiful shots and music. The music communicates the dynamic of Elio and Oliver in a very accurate way, repetitive sounds when they're tip-toeing around each other, and blatant love songs when they finally admit their feelings. The film also portrays the secrecy of being gay in the 80's. You can hear church bells frequently, as if mocking them. The film truly does a great job with non-diegetic sound, it's really what makes it aside from the chemistry between Elio and Oliver. The ending scene is particularly powerful, the off-screen sounds of life resuming while Elio cries over lost love. That is what makes this film a contemporary classic. Aside from the sounds and music, the relationships between the characters is what draws me into this film again and again. Timothee Chalamet and Armie Hammer create a sort of tension that you feel acutely aware of as an audience member, and I found myself on the edge of my seat just as much as Elio was waiting for answers. There's a certain charming awkwardness between them as they begin to develop their relationship. Throughout the film I could see the anxiety Elio constantly felt over Oliver and their avoidance of each other. Sometimes there isn't even dialogue in these moments, like when Elio can't find Oliver and we hear Sufjan Stevens' Futile Devices. Dialogue would make Elio's feelings more obvious, however Futile Devices does a great job all on its own, communicating the anxious feelings of waiting and uncertainty perfectly. The scene goes on for about two minutes, but I did not find myself bored, the song just fit too perfectly. A relationship where dialogue is very important however is the one between Elio and his father. The speech his dad gives Elio is beautiful and comforting. Call Me by Your Name is a must-see and an instant classic, in the LGBTQ+ community and beyond. It's a coming of age that is realistic and relatable, and takes the trope where it hasn't been explored before.",

Even the infamous peach scene felt like a self conscious version of something that should have been a moment of erotic confrontation and intimacy between the two male leads.

Finally Michael Stuhlbarg's monologue at the end will always bring me to tears, it is one of the most profound and beautiful monologues I've ever heard.",

And it left me more than a little concerned that the fact that Chalamet's character is below the legal age of consent (or did I get that wrong?) is barely raised as an issue throughout. A father-son scene towards the end, though, is beautifully judged and played, for me highlighting how much more I felt what went before could have been.",

And in many ways, the movie was better than the book, which surprised me.  Armie Hammer's performance as Oliver was honestly stronger in my opinion to that of Timothee Chalamet as Elio.

I think it was way too sexual. Usually this wouldn't be a problem for me especially in a movie like this but my problem is there wasn't enough scene to make you say \"Wow they're really in love that's beautiful\". Love isn't just about having sex. Love should be from an heart to another. And I didn't feel that heart. And also some lines didn't make sense at all and I found some scenes really empty. At one point the movie became painful to watch. I wanted this movie to end. But of course there were good scenes. When the movie tries to be funny it's hilarious. I really liked the humor. Armie Hammer and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet were brilliant. The film looks incredible. And that's all I wanna say. I'm really dissapointed. If you liked this story and found some things to enjoy I'm happy for you I wish I did too!",

            "content": "Call Me By Your Name is an indie type of film that is directed by Luca Guadagnino that stars Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, who plays a teenage boy, named Elio who explores his sexuality, and meets and falls in love with an older gentleman named Oliver, who is played Armie Hammer, during one summer in the 1980's. Oliver and Elio's relationship is kickstarter with the Oliver living in his family's house for the summer while helping Elio's father with some archaeological assignments in the area.\nThere were many interesting aspects about the film, however a very intriguing part of the film lies with Elio's character development and arc. At the start of the film, Timoth\u00e9e had not had a sexual partner previous to this summer in France. As the film progresses, Elio initially becomes more deeply involved with his girlfriend at the time, but eventually gets torn between she and his feelings and desires for Oliver. Eventually Elio falls for Oliver and things are good for a short period of time between them. Oliver goes back to America and Elio finds out that Oliver is getting married, then completing Elio's character arc. The character arc of Elio provides evidence of an underlying social commentary. The film shows a very detailed social commentary on the fluidity of sexuality, relationships, and love. Both Elio and Oliver love each other, but that does not mean that they cannot love others, or other types of people. Call Me By Your Name shows there is no limitation to what one can or cannot love or be sexually attracted to. \nThough there were many positives to this film, I can't help but feel that Elio's emotional roller coaster throughout the film was not supported by the film's pacing, which made it extremely difficult to stay engaged. Overall I give Call Me By Your Name a 7/10.",

Throughout the narrative, powerful storytelling comes from impeccable cinematography and profound sound design. The minimized details of movement and ambiance guide a \u2018will they- won't they' dynamic between the two lovers through the progression of the plot. The movie successfully paints a queer relationship through a tension that is embedded in its direction, and it does so in a way that can pull on audiences' heart strings and relate to a global audience on an authentic level.  \nTo allude to the attraction between the main characters Elio and Oliver, Call Me By Your Name uses various methods of diegetic sound. It's important to recognize the beauty of diegetic sound because not only are these the noises sourced within the story world, but they become clues to the exchange of secrecy and freedom. The chemistry between the two characters builds from slight interactions to intellectual conversation, growing closer with each movement- each step. For instance, the sound of a footstep can be detailed in scenes when they are walking around the town, even if the camera suggests a wider shot to capture the environment. Off-screen sound occurs from a source that is assumed to be in the space, but is outside of what is visible on screen. A majority of the sound in this film can be described as romantically ambient through off-screen sound. Outdoor noises flood the audience's ears to suggest nature as a shield to the outside world but also as a playground to fall in love with someone. It sounds as if the volume of dialogue is raised to compensate for the engines of passing vehicles, the chirps of of morning birds, and the constant movement or roar of water. \nSimilarly, the cinematography displays the beauty of the landscape, encapsulating warm, vibrant colors during the day and maintains similar granular textures through the use of a film camera. The consistency of these visual summertime cues establish how present the characters were with each other.  The composition of these shots are remarkably creative. There is a scene in which Elio confesses his emotions towards Oliver and the camera points to the ringing of church bells to show a presence of guilt and religion. It shows a story. It doesn't just tell it. The cinematography is smart, and therefore, watching this movie is deeply entertaining. \nCall Me By Your Name exemplified romance and seduction with nature playing a supporting role to emphasize how Elio and Oliver chose to exist within it. In our modern society, the film started a conversation about the LGBTQA+ community in a manner that pushes beyond the barrier of queer fetishization through the depiction of  genuine adoration of another person's soul and dealing with the consequences of its inevitable ending. It explores how love can be even more limiting past the limitation of fate and timing because it extends to societal pressure, reputation, and linked misery. This movie was gorgeously rendered and boundary-breaking, and for that reason, I would give this film a 4.5/5 star rating.  ",

            "content": "\"Call Me By Your Name\" tells the story of a complex, passionate, developing first love between a 17-year-old named Elio (Timothee Chalamet) and an American student named Oliver (Armie Hammer). The complexity of this relationship stems from multiple things; one of which being that they're both males, and they question whether or not them being together is \"right.\" Elio's father-an archaeology professor- hosts an American student to work along side him every summer at their home in northern Italy, which is how the two are introduced to begin with. \n\nSomething close to the epitome of cinematography, this movie is beautifully shot across multiple locations in Italy. With the color palette and costuming of the characters seamlessly working together to give a nature-like feel, any one scene from this film is just as visually captivating as the next. The director requested to the cinematographer- Sayombhu Mukdeeprom- to shoot the entire movie using one 35mm lens. Successfully completing this request, Mukdeeprom created an objective, natural, more authentic perspective for the viewers to watch from. He perfectly captured the raw, vulnerable emotion exuded from both Elio and Oliver as the plot unfolds, of which the people watching could connect, empathize with, and relate to with ease. \n\nFurthermore, though some say the movie is slow to pick up, I feel that the slower progression of both Oliver and Elio really internalizing their feelings was needed for the development of their relationship. The director-Luca Guadagnino- brilliantly giving them the time to grow at a slower pace allowed what they had on-screen to be portrayed as something of a deeper, more sensual meaning to the viewer. Elio's parents quickly catch on to how things are between him and Oliver, which is shown by the two giving subtle hints to both boys throughout the film. \n\nFinally, this immensely relatable, entrancing, emotionally provoking coming-of-age film shows the reality of two humans being attracted to one another for the personalities they embody, regardless of gender. This is significant and extremely eye-opening to the people watching, being that this is not an usual thing shown in films that are done as well as this film was. \"Call Me By Your Name\" is an intense, powerful masterpiece that is undoubtedly worth the watch. \n",

The chemistry between Timothee Chalemet's Elio and Armie Hammers Oliver is undeniable as they find each other whilst riding bikes through scenic northern Italy. Chalemet captures audiences with his raw, organic performance of how it feels to fall in love with the added uncertainty of coming to terms with Elios sexuality. \nOliver, a graduate student studying abroad alongside Elio's father comes off as a handsome American playboy who all the young women seem to swoon over. His cocky slang and arrogant attitude at the start of the film create an uneasiness that is not subdued till later once hi feelings toward Elio are revealed. His more masculine energy disrupts the more feminine, ethereal, lifestyle that he learns to adapt to. \nContrarily Elio, much more introverted finds himself longing to leave his family's Italian hideaway as prior to Oliver's arrival we can assume he spends his days reading alone or writing music and playing the piano. We follow Elio as he falls for Oliver, we watch his longing when Oliver is not around and his fer of saying the wrong thing around him. We watch the pairs' anxieties as the both develop their feelings and how the fear of them falling is coupled with the homophobic stigma at that time and the end of summer approaching.\nVisually the film will stun audiences with cobblestone streets and organic Italian architecture. Earthy tones are present throughout the film connecting the audience with the warm summer outdoor lifestyle when Oliver and elios story takes place. The film very much resembles a paradise of sorts with both Oliver and Elio being away from home, Oliver more than elio, the couple engages in this sort of freedom to live and fall in love. \nCallMeByYour Name is tender and fresh. It is a love story that is felt by many yet rarely told. Viewers fall in love with the protagonists' idealism and longing for one another but are inevitably heartbroken and left to just remember the warmth that first loves bring.\n",

More specifically, the relationships between Elio and Oliver, Elio and his father, and Elio and his self. \n\nFirst, I will explore the blossoming relationship between Elio (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) and Oliver (Armie Hammer). As Elio is living with Oliver, his attraction and curiosity grow exponentially with each intimate interaction. This is, as we learn, is shared by the likes of Oliver. Although Oliver's attraction toward Elio began around the same time, his approaches are calculated and reserved. This could be attributed to the age difference or the fact that he is working closely for Elio's father and has been invited to stay within their home. Eventually, Oliver replicates his feelings towards Elio. Promoted only after Elio expresses his feelings to Oliver, with \"these things.\" Their relationship allows the viewer to recap likewise awakening moments and intimacies throughout their lives. \n\nSecond, the open relationship between Elio and his father. Many can say Elio is lucky to have a father that is as open and accepting as that of Elio's. Without reservation, his father accepts Elio and his coming of age. One instance, when Elio openly admits that he almost had sex with a local, Marcie. This honesty and transparency are not often shared between father and son. This concept is further explored when Elio's father shares a relationship similar to that of Elio and Oliver. He invited Elio to hold onto that moment, and is even jealous - due to the fact that he had a similar opportunity and was not courageous enough to pursue himself. The relationship allows the viewer to either relate to that of their fathers, or wish to have had a relationship so open and honest. \n\nLastly, the relationship between Elio and himself. Elio throughout the course of the movie is searching for different things. That of self actualization, self acceptance, sexuality enlightenment, and every thing an adolescent faces. This ebbs and flows as he kisses Oliver, groping him - then weeks later presumably loses his virginity to Marcie. It is only after Oliver leaves that reality sets in for Elio - and his resolved relationship ending brings only more questions of sexuality and how he will continue in his life. The viewer is able to assess their own life - thinking of their growth, experiences held, self actualization, and ultimate worldview. Additionally, we all can relate to Elio staring into the fire as the movie rolls credits - as he fully realizes there would be no longer a possibility for Elio to continue with Oliver. \n",

It was the type of love you could not control your actions or what your heart desired. Now it was sexual, but it didn't make me feel uncomfortable. You understood why it had to be apart of the movie. What made the movie quite difficult to understand was Elio's relationship with a girl named Marzia. They had a little something going on as well. But when Elio and Oliver started their love quest it made me question why still talk to Marzia in that way. The music in this movie particularly had a major role as it carried one seen to the next scene. The end was probably my favorite scene in the whole movie.

These elements presented in the film creates a more Realism approach like you are there in the movie even though it set in the 1980's. \n\nThe very last scene of the film, where Elio is crying and holding himself white sitting in front of the fire in his house. During this last scene, the title of the movie appears on the screen. The camera doesn't change screens, but stays constant on Elio even when the credits roll on. The nondigetic sound of the fire represents more than just fire it indicates the relationship Elio once had with Oliver. It's burning and fading, he looks at the fire like he's looking back in the past when it was summer and the times he had with Oliver. This emotional and intimate scene, Elio is holding himself because he knows he is going to be okay and he'll grow from this. \nIt has Elio looking back at his first true love, which provided him a better understanding of himself thus he grew. Many of us don't have to be homosexuals to relate to the film. The film is shot by one perspective, one tone and one way. This camera work allows us to be intimate with the characters in the film.

These emotions are conveyed not only by the incredible performance of the actors but also the quality of scenes and the diegetic sounds. Every single sound within the world of this film adds to the meaning of this time constrained love story, whether it be the loud screeching of a bus or the ring of church bells. In each scene you can hear the most seemingly unimportant sounds, like birds chirping and water crashing onto rocks from the top of waterfalls. The fact that the viewers and audience can each and every sound makes your body become aware of everything that is being carried out in the scene. These natural and intense sounds mirror the feelings and passion that Elio (Timothee Chalamet) and Oliver (Armie Hammer) have developed and shard for each other. This film explores love and its limits in a sensitive and sensual way. It takes the viewers from the beginning to end, because this love story does end only a few days after it started. ",

            "content": "'Call Me By Your Name' is a quick, luscious, and slowly seductive escapade that envelopes the viewer into the summer love story of Elio and Oliver. This movie is a rapture, an absolute necessity - as it pulls the viewer through the most profound moments of young love. However, this is not a boy gets a girl coming of age - this is the delicate dance between queer men as they tease out their intentions. \n\nThe story unfolds in a lively private space. Rapid and successive tight shots lead us into the private details of Elio's home in northern Italy. These moments pass by, allowing us almost to taste the cracked egg, feel the breeze, speak the romantic languages of French, Italian, and Latin. \n\nThe lighting is natural - the tone warm - evocative of sensual human pleasures as well as the safety of home and family. Oliver becomes a disruption to this - his skin glistening more than the river - his language curt. Elio teases Oliver's American mannerisms at dinner, \"just watch this is how he will say goodbye to us when the time comes: Later.\" \n\nThese visual moments often cut between dual tensions: water and earth; freedom and time. These choices are deliberate. In the scene where Elio is playing the piano to his father's guests on the night, he and Oliver are meant to meet at midnight. The camera pans from vicarious music playing to wristwatch-subverting to the audience the ending we know will happen, but hope will never come. \n\nAlthough we see each of these tight shots of the summer and Elio and Oliver, we feel the altered sound perspective, making the domestic elements a sort of 'main character.' We see the floorboards, but we hear them creak as if they are speaking to us; remember this is a secret - this is love - this is taboo.  \n\nThis 'main character' - the sounds of the house - pull us in closer and closer as the story unravels, each moment becomes a tease - a playful analogy to what could be for Elio and Oliver. Eventually, we even hear the slightest touch until Elio and Oliver are finally overwhelmed by each other. \n\nIn the end, however, Oliver, who was only there for six weeks, leaves to go back home. However, this is only one heartbreak Elio experiences. The last part of the story cuts forward, and once again, the play of tensions is at work. Although here, it is the tension between snow and fire.  \n\nOliver calls to inform the family he is getting married. When Elio hangs up the phone, he goes to sit by the fireplace, cracking and bright. Behind him, we can see a window. The snow falls outside - dense and quiet. We are with Elio in his last heartbreak. The house has him caught between his past. The dynamic and passionate love of Oliver reflected in the fire's glow on Elio's face, and his future, we see out the window behind him silent healing. ",

On one side, if you appreciate the love, heavy sound illustration and extreme amount of detail within the dialog, the time is gracefully distributed. However, if you miss the \"love train,\" the run-time may feel like an endless loop of pretty shots. I will say I am on the good side of this sword for the most part. I can't help it, I LOVE love. The love story that's told is such a unique story within the complications of a gay relationship that I can only appreciate what is being told. Love is a universal topic and I think it's translated here perfectly. As a straight man I still felt all the compassion and emotion between Elio and Oliver, our lovers. Our lovers start off with very innocent and brief interactions which was so easy to get attached too. (Now back to my double sided sword analogy) If you're on the bad side of things you may feel like this movie is a drag and a waste of time. I get it, this movie is LOOOOONG and the shots take a lot of patience to sit through. It's like raising a child I'd imagine. From a young age you sit and wait for your kid to adapt to a very beautiful flower. Luckily the child this film adapted into was a very elegant and well thought out composition with sound bridges so well placed you forget how important your ears actually are. This movie will stand against time as far as love goes, blending in with this new age of compassion and love.   ",

            "content": "\tCall Me By Your Name struck me as a piece of art as well as a cinematic success. While it did have its shortcomings, I found it entertaining and moving overall. The location, \"north italy,\" along with the cinematography created this mystical world for the story to unfold within. The story balances melancholy and beautiful moments well as Elio continuously struggles with his identity, juxtaposed with him falling in love with Oliver and accepting what is being built between the two of them. I believe the only quarrels I have with the film are it's pacing and the lack of societal struggle and outside influence that Elio is faced with. The pacing, while intentionally slow in the beginning, seems almost too slow in the first half of the film. It certainly creates a build up for the beautiful explosion of their love for eachother, yet it felt too sluggish for me personally. Though in perspective, I typically appreciate action and fast paced films, so this take on the pacing is highly biased and I recognize that to some it may not seem that way to some. My second and only other problem with the movie is the lack of struggle presented to Elio considering the time period. It all seems too perfect that he is so accepted and loved by his parents and those around him regardless of the societal climate in 1983 surrounding the LGBTQ community. With those complaints, it still didn't take away from the overall experience and message the film conveyed. It shone through those imperfections with excellent cinematography, acting, and storyline. Scene to scene everything down to the ambient sound is done with nothing but pure intention alluding the audience to what is occuring emotionally within Elio or Oliver. Every single character is casted to their part suitably and acts it out in a way that is immersive, especially Timothee Chalamet. All in all, Call Me By Your Name is a magical coming-of age tale, and was very moving to me. I would give this film a 4.5/5 ",

            "content": "The film Call Me By Your Name takes place in the summer of 1983 in northern Italy. The main characters, Oliver and Elio, accurately portray what it's like to struggle with sexuality when religion and conservative ideals stand in your way. Timothee Chalamet, who plays the part of Elio, does a stellar job at portraying the innocent nature of a 17-year-old who is struggling to discover himself as he ventures into a secret relationship with an older man, Oliver, who is working for his father. While the film accurately captured the intimate journey of two men who are just discovering their sexualities, the plot itself seems too good to be true. During this time period, being gay was something that wasn't close to being fully accepted yet. The fact that Oliver an Elio faced little to no retributions or hatred for their relationship was unusual to me, being that they also lived in an area where religion was a part of everyones' family life. While the film's intent was to portray this intimate relationship in a beautiful way, it was not as realistic as one would expect. While viewers enjoy seeing a romanticized love story with little to no struggles, it sends the wrong message to viewers who are struggling with their sexualities. For instance, in the scene where Elio's father talks to him about his relationship with Oliver, he is fully supportive and even makes a reference to himself struggling with his own sexuality but being too afraid to act on it. So not only does Elio's very religious father accept him being gay with no question, but he also reveals that he has experienced feelings of the same nature. So while Call Me By Your Name was beautifully filmed and has a plot that moves people of all ages and sexualities, it was too unrealistic for its setting. \n",

            "content": "I struggle to rate this movie because I simultaneously love it and hate it. The cinematography of the film is beautiful. The framing and color keep the film interesting visually during slower scenes. The sounds of 1980's Italy: birds chirping, bicycles, creaky hardwood floors of Elio's family's estate, and the sounds of the countryside set an overall nostalgic and comforting mood for the film without becoming boring and while still creating meaning. Outside of the non-diegetic sound, the soundtrack paired is  one of my personal favorites of any film. The mood of the film follows the songs chosen and produced to a tee: hopeful during Elio and Oliver's last adventures together and bittersweet and reminiscent when Elio receives a phone call from Oliver later telling him he's getting married. Repeated loops of sound created a repeated feeling of sweetness that made my heart melt for the two. The editing uses sound in ways to invoke feeling in its watchers in a way I doubt I've ever seen in any other films. That being said, I also hold a grudge against the film within my own personal taste. I strongly believe that there needs to be more representation surrounding LGBT+ coming of age stories and/or romances. However, I also believe that not all representation is good representation. Throughout the entirety of the movie I couldn't get over the large age gap between Elio and Oliver, which was often played up through camera angles and framing. It felt predatory at times, for example when Elio watches Oliver leave, the camera framing and angle works to make him Elio appear child-like. In addition to that, the constant and detailed sex scenes over-fetishized the relationship in my opinion, one example being the famous and slightly disturbing scene involving a peach which uses detailed sound to make the scene even more pornographic. I would have loved to see a more relatable  love story between to two, maybe a sex scene here or there and without the age gap. I feel as though this would have helped to create a more positive portrayal of the gay relationship and could have created a positive form of representation, rather than adding to the harmful  and untrue stigma surrounding gay relationships as being more hyper-sexual or predatory than straight ones. The film did have some moments of sweetness and a positive relationship between the two, but overall it felt very far from most types of relationships portrayed between straight couples in other films. I praise the film for its use of sound and cinematography in itself, it's a beautiful experience to listen to and watch. However, the plot and characters and even sound and cinematography at times, did very little to work forward for gay representation in film and in some ways I fear may have even added to existing stigmas in some viewers' eyes. I appreciate the film for its artistry but would recommend looking elsewhere if looking for an LGBT+ film with a positive message.",

            "content": " \"Call Me By Your Name\" is a striking coming-of-age story, following 17 year-old Elio and 24 year-old Oliver in their queer discovery. I personally thought that the director, Luca Guadagnino, did a wonderful job with incorporating precise and intentional camerawork into the story. In one scene Oliver and Elio ride their bikes out to a monument and begin discussing their feelings. At one moment the camera pans upward to show a church, then shifts downward again to reveal Elio standing alone just peering up at it. This shot is almost a bit eerie feeling because of the way it is presented to the viewer. The church is there to represent Elio coming to terms with his sexuality in the face of religion, no doubt a daunting task. Since both Elio and Oliver are Jewish, this camerawork only deepens that frightening feeling they must be going through, fearing rejection from something they have grown so close to. Besides knowing how to make proper use of a camera, Guadagnino is skillful in how sound is presented to the viewer. It makes us aware of Elio's internal struggles with his sexuality. Diegetic sound is utilized in scenes where Elio is playing the piano, basically pouring out his feelings for Oliver in the best way he knows how. In contrast, nondiegetic sound can be found in the film through the transitions between scenes where there is a small piano motif. I found that in many of the scenes where this musical phrase plays, Elio is thinking about his feelings for Oliver. It is a small signal to us while watching that Elio is truly overcome by struggle with his sexuality throughout the whole of the film, since these nondiegetic sounds occur up until the very end. Speaking of the end, there isn't a more powerful shot than Elio gazing into the fire after learning that Oliver is engaged to a woman. An incredible performance by Timothee Chalamet, the viewer can see his tortured thoughts simply through his glazed over eyes and the shadows cast around him from the fire. I can now say that \"Call Me By Your Name\" is one of my new go-to movies, for when I need to cry, laugh, or contemplate deeply about my own life.",

The film touches on the topic of queerness and coming to terms with your true identity and how it affects the close people around you. Elio (Timothee Chamalet) is a 17 year old living in Italy in the year of 1987. His father (Michael Stuhlbarg) is a very decorated professor who focused mainly on Architecture. In this particular summer, Oliver (Armie Hammer) visits their home in Italy to work as an intern for Elio's father. During this time they are together, you can watch as the bond between Elio and Oliver grows. Getting to the point of having a romantic relationship near the end of the summer.\n\nI was blown away by the way the film was able to teach things to the audience. Visually the film is breathtaking. Being in the beautiful city of Italy alone already gives it a plus but the cinematography was easily admirable. One scene in particular that really caught my attention was the famous statue scene. This scene can be argued as the climax of the film due to Elio confessing his true feelings to Oliver. The way this scene was shot was with using a technique called a Long Take, meaning there were no cuts. Being an actor, I know how it can sometimes be risky to have people act for a long period of time without being able to take a break. Luckily, Luca Guadagnino, the director of the film, took this risk and I feel everyone who saw it can admire his decision to do so. \n\nI loved every second of this film. Somewhat of an embarrassment to admit, I have a very small attention span. It takes a lot for me to actually sit through a film and enjoy it. Call Me By Your Name uses a concept knows as a \"Forward.\" This means that the actions of the characters either verbally or physically causes the audience to want to know what happens next. Due to the film keeping this up all the way to the beautiful end credit scene, led to me on the edge of my seat wanting to know the next action. This is a definite shout-out to the writer of this film because he deserves a lot of credit for it's success. I highly recommend this film to anyone who simply just likes movies for the story, cinematography, and the writing. \n\nLoved it!\n\nDawson Garrett ",

The scenes flow together beautifully  and the movie as a whole gives off a sense or nostalgia. The movie does a lot with sound that is clever, but may be too loud for some. The use of sound bridges really tied a lot of scenes together that without them could have been bland. However, the dialogue in the movie is cheesy and unecessary and it can't be ignored that Oliver is a predator. Throughout most of the film Elio continues to have childish outbursts which seems to only make Oliver more attracted to him. Each caress, kiss, and embrace they share is only clouded in the fact that Elio and Oliver being together is 100% wrong. Although their relationship seems romantic, when the parents are around you are once again reminded that Elio is a child and that this relationship should jot be allowed to happen. Not only this, but the dialogue leaves much to be imagined. Long monologues are given where they aren't needed and it seems that people are just stringing word together to make whatever they say sound poetic instead of it actually making sense. There are many scenes that are so uncomfortable in the movie that they are hard to watch(i.e.the peach scene.) It seems as if the movie drags on which make sit feel like three days rather than two hours.

Elio is a 17 year old boy and Oliver is a doctoral student who works for Elio's father as an intern over the summer. It's an overwhelming, exciting love story between the two. However, it slowly unravels due to Oliver's departure to the United States. Throughout the time Oliver stayed in the same house as Elio, he began to find his true self. Elio kept the relationship with Oliver a secret due to his religion. He also kept it secret because he also had a girlfriend at the time and was afraid of what his parents might say. Elio's parents didn't suspect a thing between the two, they just thought they were becoming best friends. As it came time for their relationship to come to an end, Elio's parents thought it was a good idea for the two to go on a mini vacation together. On the vacation together they became more intimate with one another, but on the last night upon being with each other everything became unsettling. In the scene where Oliver was looking out the window and turned around to look at Elio while he was sleeping. Elio had a sonic flashback of all the memories he had with Oliver. Once Elio put Oliver onto the train and it began to depart, he began to feel an unbearable pain in his heart. He felt as if he'd never feel that connection with anyone ever again. \n",

It's spinning with hidden meaning and deep feelings that the characters try to keep concealed from one another. The accuracy in which the film manages to capture Elio's expression of his emotions portrayed wonderfully by Timothy Chalet and it captures the feeling of fumbling in the dark and trying to find yourself in your teenage years. It's visually transfixing with the Italian scenery as well as the sound and music that plays a key role within the film. The music in Elio's scenes are important representative auditory factors in his self-discovery throughout the film. Also, the background noise plays a key role in certain intimate scenes. Costuming and makeup are done to perfection with the time period from the outfits to the hair. The film calls to a younger adult audience can that can find easy relation in this film due to the coming of age vibe that pertains to it. The film does contain one definitive flaw. Oliver (played by Armie Hammer) is the college-aged man who catches Elio's interest. This presents a moral issue in the sense that Elio is 17 years old and Oliver is 24 years old, yet Oliver engages in a sexual and emotional relationship with him. I found Oliver's character was overly romanticized considering that he and Elio's relationship would be very taboo and very illegal in most places. If you put it in the standard of a straight relationship, it'd have been put to an end immediately. What is odd is that Elio's parents seem to know about him and Oliver though it's unspoken.

This film is a work of art and very passionate; it shows the friendship blossoming into love between Elio and Oliver in the summer of 1983 in a little town in northern Italy. When watching this film I noticed that it has a lot of repetition from the sounds, to the music, and dialogue. With dialogue, Oliver tends to say \"Later\" throughout the film. With sound and music, Elio plays classical pieces on the piano that show up throughout the movie conveying its importance to the audience that it is going to be a recurring theme/song that represents Elio and Oliver's blooming relationship. I loved watching this film because of the connection these two characters (Elio and Oliver) have with each other and how hesitant they are at first and how scary it can be to have those type of feelings, especially in that time period. Also with Elio's parents and how they view Elio and Oliver's relationship and their love for Elio and how they just want him to live life and embrace everything around at 17 years old. I also loved seeing the struggles they face within themselves and to express their feelings and emotions. The film takes you through different emotions from the beginning to the heartbreaking end.

Taken place in the household of Elio(an American teen living in itlay)and his family, an exchange student by the name of Oliver came to stay with them because Elios dad is an archeologists professor. Over the summer the two grow to connect and build a strong relationship. What really stands out is the different types of sounds you hear, depending on the situation and mood of the characters. The way Elio was playing the song on the piano was good, but not the way it should be played. Oliver kept telling him to be yourself and play the original version. In the moment it didn't seem like a big deal but when you actually look back on it later Oliver was meaning a whole lot more then just the song. Another beautiful sound element in the movie was when they were standing by the waterfall and it felt like you were there with them about to get blown away. The more you watch this movie the more you fall in love with the sounds Luca chose to put in the movie.

The scene where Elio is telling Oliver the history of the statue in town and Oliver asks him why Elio is telling him this, Elio responds saying 'because I though you should know'. When Oliver repeats Elio's answer with a questionable tone, Elio walks around the statue quietly repeating 'because I thought you should know', to then whispering 'because I wanted you to know', with a tone that sounded less doubtful and its Elio's way of confirming to himself that he feels something for Oliver. The dialogue between Oliver and Elio shows that Oliver wanted Elio to be more confident in himself and what he actually wants and the usage of repetition in the scene shows Elio is questioning himself as to why he would open up to Oliver and tell him the history of the statue. After Elio repeats that quote to himself a couple of times, he comes to the realization that he wanted Oliver to know that story of the statue and his sense of doubt is gone. \n   Another thing that I had noticed in this movie was how the two characters never actually said 'I love you' to one another. However, viewers are able to the characters have strong feelings for each other by their facial expressions. In the scene where Oliver is about to leave and Elio goes with him to see him off, they both embrace each other in silence and the viewers can tell that these two characters obviously felt more than just lust for one another, they had a true connection. When Oliver goes on the train and as it begins to move, there is an extreme long shot view of the train and Elio looking at the train as it gets further ad further away. The use of cinematography in that scene was able to show me how much Elio was going to miss Oliver because even though the train was starting to leave the shot, Elio remained at the train tracks and kept looking in the direction of the train. And the finale scene of the movie, when Elio and Oliver had their last conversation with each on the phone, and Elio repeats his name to Oliver on the phone, I think that this use of repetition in this dialogue is Elio's way of saying 'i love you' to Oliver. Through out the movie Elio is unsure and nervous while with Oliver, however, towards the end of this film, it is Oliver who is now unsure and nervous with Elio in their last phone conversation, their roles have become reversed towards the end of the movie.",

While I adored the indie vibe that this film presented all throughout the film, there was one specific moment that even months after watching has stuck with me. The end of Call Me by Your Name could not have ended any better. Timothee Chalamet perfectly displays heart break at the end of the film after his characters receives a phone call with the news that his summertime lover is planning to get married to someone besides himself. This film uses non-diegetic sound as the song Visions of Gideon by Sufjan Stevens plays. The lyrics seem to be written on Timothees face. This film displays true emotion as he looks off into the distance with clear heartbreak written on his face. With its repetitive lyrics, it is clear to the viewers that Timothees character is reminiscing on all of his memories with his summertime lover as the lyrics, \"is it a video\" play. While this film could've ended on a happier note, I personally don't think it should have. The end displays a very real reality that many people struggling with their sexuality face. This makes the movie even more relatable to viewers that face this struggle. Call Me by Your Name will definitely have you itching to view it again, and for that, I say kudos to the director, Luca Guadagnino. ",

            "content": "    In Luca Guadagnino's inspiring, compelling and even suspenseful drama/romance film , \"Call Me By Your Name\", a young boy 17-year old boy in Italy named Elio is faced with conflicting feelings of being queer when faced with his father's summer intern/doctoral student, Oliver, and descends through a journey of self-exploration and passion. Guadagnino gave a superb representation of internal conflict and feelings of individuals experiencing \"queer\" or \"gay\" feelings/preferences as well as their tendency to isolate themselves. Over generations, there has been a huge increase in support of the LGBTQ community, but in the 80's, where the film takes place, the subject of acceptance and discussions of LGBTQ individuals was still fragile and sensitive/touchy in society.\n\n    Throughout the film, there is little attention or judgement posed on Elio and Oliver due to their numerous choices of isolation. Due to this, the two characters are never caught in public nor shamed for their actions. There is a scene where they are roaming the streets of Italy with excitement and exuberant acts of affection where the camera catches them at medium shots and long shots, quickly panning along in unison with their movements and slowly focusing in as they get closer. These swift shots allow the viewer to feel their sense of risk as well as true passion towards each other. They knew it was deemed \"wrong\" in their community, but took the risk anyway. In the 80's, displaying affection with the same sex in public was rarely attempted due to the responses it received. This resulted in these impulsive acts, revealing their longing for comfort and freedom in society, which was a common feeling felt with other queer/gay individuals.\n\n    Also, Elio's internal conflict was expressed several times throughout the film, and was emphasized to an even greater extent in the classic closing scene. In the closing scene, Elio is seen walking into the dining room of his home, where the table is filled with decorations and being prepared for dinner. He makes his way over to the burning fire, kneels down and expresses a deep, long gaze, exploring his own internal feelings. The camera displays a racking focus, switching our attention from his outside surroundings, and solely on him, almost as if he is in his own head internalizing the song playing. The song, \"Is it A Video\" plays, starting off at a depressive, low pitch state, and coming to an eventual high pitch climax, which mirrored his own facial expressions. His face started off with tears and sadness, and ending in acceptance of his situation and a smile. The sonic texture of the music paired with the focusing shot, successfully allowed the viewer to visualize not only the internal conflict and mental distress he is experiencing, but what so many other queer/gay individuals are experiencing as well. Having to accept the fact that they could not love who they wanted was common and deemed unhealthy mentally. To conclude, I feel as though this film displayed a perfect interpretation of queer/gay individuals during this time period and in this location.\n",

There was no hiding of the messiness and infatuation of this romance, which in truth, took me some time to come around to, because it did change my stereotypical and archetypal love story. I felt that melancholic ending to my core and know that I will hold on to this movie for a long time. ",

            "content": "Call Me Maybe:\n\nCall Me By Your Name received a lot of buzz with many calling it a modern love masterpiece. The visually stunning film with robust colors and eye gripping scene design stands at the top of the cinematographic pedestal. The film doesn't jump out at you with brilliance, but as the plot crawls along, it fills you with a sense of warmth few movies ever give. \n\nCall Me By Your Name is set in Italy in 1983. Elio, a 17-year-old homosexual struggling with a sense of self and identity in a time when society suppressed all non-heteronormative thoughts. His father's intern, Oliver a 24-year-old American Ph.D. student, is also homosexual but due to society often engages with women. Elio does more than hint at his infatuation for the American, but throughout the film we see him struggle with acceptance of his feelings. \n\nElio is entirely dependent on his parents and is blooming into adulthood, but he's certainly not there yet making the true love story clash a bit. The film pins Elio's coming of age entirely on his sexuality throughout, spending nearly a quarter of the film in incredibly sexual situations. The vivid depiction of his young teenage lust is slathered throughout the unlikely love story in ways that most viewers don't expect.   \n\nTo say the film is long-winded is an understatement. Call Me By Your Name spares no scene in telling a relatively slow coming of age true love story. Italian director Luca Guadagnino allows the viewer to stroll at their own pace through the 132-minute plot and not miss a beat. A lot of scenes almost feel unnecessary as we see so little character development outside of sex. The archetypal true love story is questionable while one's primal instincts are flashing red as a seemingly statutory relationship is made believable. \n\nThe setting of the film has almost nothing to do with the plot as a challenging topic of homosexuality in the '80s is made to seem culturally accepted. The only opposition the two characters see is their self-doubt as no one seems to question their involvement. Because of this, the paradise world of acceptance makes the film hard to engage with and inaccurately represents the struggles the gay community has and does face. I think Moonlight got this part right as the characters were more relatable through hardships and not their mental urges being suppressed by a theoretical cultural opposition.  \n\nThe film itself is well written and visually perfect. and I would recommend it to others. But, the development is lackluster and the pacing is somewhat wasteful as viewers are on the hook for more than two hours for a relatively simple resolution. I give Call Me By Your Name 3 out of 5 stars. It doesn't blow you away, but you can't help but smile to see young love be affirmed when society opposes it. The most important aspect is it's not your typical true love story yet audiences still identify with it very strongly. This speaks to how far we've come as a society. \n",

            "content": "What can be salvaged from Call Me by Your Name is the hope that a great book was spoiled by the ineptitude of major motion picture producers. Otherwise, one is left with the burning feeling that there really may be a great disconnect between what they and others consider great art. And this burning feeling is only supplemented by the fear that others might betray their own feelings and project approval on works of art that they think they are supposed to like because of whatever societal narrative is thrown down their throats. Yes, I do really fear that the reason why Call Me by Your Name received such high acclaim is because of its message and not its craft.\n\tBecause if you were really entertained during the vast majority of that film, then your standards for entertainment are very sad indeed. So long as a production has Timothee Chalamat's face, idyllic Italian landscapes, and music then you are to be satisfied. For it was made quite clear that other factors were nowhere near the top of the priority list for the filmmakers. Character development was vested totally in two characters both of whom the filmmakers reasoned shouldn't really experience too much transformation because Gd forbid that might make them the least bit interesting. \n\tWhile the depiction of a young gay couple should seemingly be good for representation purposes, the connotations brought about by the film's depiction of this couple are obviously problematic. Firstly, Elio is no older than seventeen and while he shows no hesitation in hooking up with his father's research assistant, one would hope the man who appears at the very least ten years Elio's senior would show some prudence. Oliver seems to be far more concerned with his own satisfaction than the effects of his actions on an obviously innocent Elio, a character shown to be a clear novice in exploring his sexuality. Nonetheless, Oliver persists and the juxtaposition of his sterling frame breeds all the more worry in the viewer as he watches Elio try to keep up. \n\tThe film hyper focuses on Elio and attempts to get away with little suspense, little plot-driven excitement, and much confusion. The producers muddied this film with depictions rather than narratives. Instead of captivating the audience with stories and scenes, they merely showed landscapes, people, and moments. While these small glimpses into the lives of characters are vital in films, they lose their charm when the film becomes a composite of small talk and meaningless interaction which contributes to no larger narrative. \n\tNearing the end of Charlie Kaufman's Adaptation, McKee says, \"I'll tell you a secret. The last act makes a film. Wow them in the end, and you got a hit. You can have flaws, problems, but wow them in the end, and you've got a hit.\" Call Me by Your Name had flaws, problems, and still, almost got out scott-free with an ending that would make McKee beam with pride. The mundaneness of the first two hours gave the ending a particular leeway to shine. And shine it did. Unexpectedly, Elio's father delivers a monologue reminiscent of Robin Williams' famous park scene in Good Will Hunting. It is an impassioned speech of acceptance. Coupled with an ending scene in which Sufjan Stevens' chords could drive angels to speech, Call Me by Your Name submitted a farewell that almost made me excuse the past two hours of misery. \n\n",

            "content": "The experience of young love can be difficult to portray on screen as it can easily feel false and condescending when brought to life by adult men. This film does not make the mistakes of Flipped (2010) or Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging (2008) and treats it's characters and their concerns seriously even if they are rather juvenile. It serves as more of a love letter to youth and the passions that consume you than anything and we are swept up in the emotions and the excitement of the young lovers we are so enchanted by and we are utterly devastated when they are separated.\n\nSomewhere in Italy in 1983 seventeen year old Elio Perlman, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, falls in love with his father's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Oliver, Armie Hammer, over the summer. He initially struggles with his own feelings and chooses to willfully ignore and disrespect him so he will not be hurt. The two eventually admit their feelings for one another and consummate their relationship but affairs are complicated by Perlman's relationship with Marzia, Esther Garrel, and Oliver's ambivalence about entering into a heterosexual relationship. The two fall in love completely but Oliver leaves and Perlman must deal with moving on from his first real love.\n\nDirector Luca Guadagnino is well known for his ability to make his audiences understand not only the visual senses but also be able to taste the fresh peas that the characters consume and smell the dewy grass that they lie in. I couldn't tell you exactly what it is that he does but you do feel familiar with the locations that he films in by at least the midpoint of the film and small moments dropped in between scenes that advance the plot inform you of the location and the way that people live their everyday lives. Films should be able to make you feel something and this film not only makes you care for it's characters but also the world they inhabit as you feel quite an affection for this little Italian town by the end of the film.\n\nThe love story itself is richly developed as the film makes the deliberate decision to move slowly and show the attraction between it's two leads building up. The repressed sexual tension could initially come off as anger towards one another but then we discover that the two are in fact extremely drawn to each other and we feel overjoyed when Oliver finally agrees to physically engage with the moody Perlman. When we see the two of them together they do not seem overly idealized as we know that they are both afraid of losing the ecstatic happiness they currently feel. This tension is present in all of their movements and when Perlman breaks down we are simultaneously horrified and comforted by the empathetic response of his lover. The screenplay, written by the famed James Ivory, informs our love of these characters as it never seems to rush through their relationship and has a real understanding of what would attract these two to one another in the first place.\n\nThe performances add to the beauty of the film as breakout star Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is subtle and sensitive in the lead role even when we witness him using a peach to pleasure himself. He also has great chemistry with Hammer who is capable of bringing a necessary jocularity and confidence to the role that complements the more intense and artistic Perlman. The supporting cast amaze us with their ability to convey so much in so little time as we really feel for them even as they interrupt the relationship we want to see thrive. Michael Stuhlbarg gives a great turn as Perlman's supportive archaeology professor father with a scene in which he counsels his son after Oliver's departure being one of the most moving in the film. Amira Casar is reflexive and all knowing as the glamorous mother to Perlman while Garrel brings surprising depth to the role of third wheel quickly abandoned in the love triangle between Perlman and Oliver. \n\nI would have been very happy to see this film receive more awards from the Academy but I don't think that is quite as good as the fabulous Lady Bird (2017).",

A total unknown when he shot this, makes you wonder if you've been under a rock because he is breathtaking talent. So much the lead of this movie and charming beyond his years. He overwhelms you and makes you love Elio, his character. The problem is, that is it. The plot is a bit thin. He falls in love but the other actor, played by Armie Hammer, is so bland and wooden, you miss the subtle seduction and love story. It just happens on you, and you wonder, how you got there. Hammer is woefully out of his depth and miscast to the point he ruins this movie. His looks are also off putting in the fact he looks twice his age which make a him not remotely believable as a 24 year old, adding a creepy dynamic to story.  The book is far better. ",

It feels to me like he has no regard for Marzia's feelings. Maybe even like he's using her. He's very caught up in his own feelings. He's young, stupid, conflicted and very much in love (the latter which I only truly grasped towards the end of the film). \nIt's understandable. But still. I can't not think of it while watching the main story unfold. It withholds me from getting immersed in Elio's character and the love story.

She's in love. You'd guess he'd have the theory of mind ability to place himself in her shoes, especially since he now knows how intense and important love can be.

It came as kind of a shock to me, but now that I think about it it kind of fits. I feel like she's not in love with Elio in an infatuation kind of way. She actually loves him. Why, I don't know. She probably has her reasons. Anyway, she tells him she's not mad at him. She communicated her feelings and fears. Elio disregards those feelings and turns her fear into reality. He very explicitly hurts her\u2026 and she still loves him and truly wants to be his friend. She's too pure for this world.\n\nNote: Not to say that you can necessarily choose the way you love someone or don't. If you fall for someone and become infatuated and obsessed with that person, it's not like it's a choice. I mean with this that Elio isn't necessarily a worse person than Marzia.

I feel like Elio was being very sexual by saying whispering, almost moaning, his name over and over again. Oliver's breathing increased. That's not something your fiancee is gonna like.\n\nI'm not sure what to make of the monologue by Elio's dad at the end. I feel like he captures the essence of the movie. Feeling your feelings. Don't put them away, don't wish you never had them. I'm not sure what he meant by: most people go bankrupt by 30. \n\nYour heart is worn out and people don't look at your body anymore. \n\nHe himself has never experienced that. He came close.

The happy and uplifting parts of the movie are all set in bright, yellow to blue-ish colours that are straight out of a dream - which it is.\n\nAt the end of the movie, many months after the relationship between the two main characters, all of the scenes are set in dark environment - mostly in darkly lit parts of the room or with dark-ish colour set - dark blue / grey / black.\n\nI love that. Being able to tell the feeling of the main character just from seeing his clothes and the room he's sitting at is awesome and really clever.\n\nObviously the story is really good. I don't personally find it too long, yeah, it has a lot of quiet parts, but that really emphasis on the feeling behind Eliot's and Oliver's relationship.",

The story, the visuals, the dialogue and the passion behind Luca Guadagnino's project are all so incredibly apparent the second that the opening shot happens. Perhaps the only flaw with this film is that we don't get to see what happens to Elio Perlman after the events he goes through with his first real love. Guadagnino is one of the rare directors where his passion shines through in every shot, perfectly portraying Elio's feelings almost as perfectly as Andre Acinan's original novel does, only missing the tiny intimate and personal touches that can only be pulled off through spoken word. Personally I have never seen such an accurate portrayal of queer love and representation in a film, it fills me with such pride to be able to see films like this be nominated for 3 major academy awards including best picture?

In some ways, not a great deal happens. We see a summer romance grow from flirtatious glances and stolen moments, become a sexual exploration and then end. In many ways, it is all quite innocent and yet also quite profound. The atmosphere created is highly aesthetic and somewhat inaccessible with many slow, languorous moments where we witness discussions of ancient history and culture. In some ways, the family seems distant, almost cold which contrast with the hot and sweaty setting of rural Italy. The handsome visitor, Oliver, played by Armie Hammer, is an idealised vision of a mysterious lover who awakens the desires of the young Elio (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) who is experimenting with his sexuality. Director Luca Guadagnino makes good use of the beautiful backdrop with many scenes set bicycling through the parched Italian countryside. My only gripe is I wasn't totally convinced by the relationship between Elio and his academic parents which at times seemed to me to be artificially high-brow. I'm not sure it was totally believable as they seemed simultaneously unaware of what was going on and yet totally complicit in their son's burgeoning sexuality and adulthood.",

Both are about a young man living with his parents, who's father brings another young man to come help him with his work. This new man is from another country, and is strong and handsome. The two butt heads at first, but soon end up falling for one another, having to hide their love from the world. Ultimately God's Own Country is better, and maybe that's unfair. Comparing this two movies that could not have been influenced by one another and preferring the one I saw first. Both movies had stellar work from the cast, and both were beautifully shot. But God's Own Country just took me on a more powerful journey. I felt the joy of the highs, and the crushing despair of the lows, and I can't say the same about Call Me By Your Name. While Armie Hammer and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet have an undeniably deep connection, too much of the film's runtime is dedicated to Elio longing after Oliver, and not enough time is spent on their actual relationship. So many scenes in this movie are pretty but superfluous. So much time is wasted on things that are not the central romance; the thing we are here to see. I also have a big problem with how the relationship between Elio and Marzia resolves, it feels too easy, like they're letting Elio off the hook instead of dealing with a flaw in his character. It is a beautiful film though, it's just unfortunate that it was proceeded by a movie that I feel did a better job of accomplishing the same goals.",

It's a tough feat to pull off at the best of times, and going into 'Call Me by Your Name', I was expecting something good, but certainly nothing like what I got. I think, if I had to describe this movie in one word, it would be therapeutic. Luca Guadagnino, who completely outdid my expectations, manages to capture such a leisurely atmosphere with the warm summer days - cycling, reading and resting by the pool - that it just makes you feel totally relaxed and comfortable. The fact that there isn't really a plot also helps achieve this. The central love story, which was handled very well, feels so much more emotive and rewarding thanks to this setting, and whilst everything is really great and well-handled, I think it's this warm, content atmosphere that makes the movie really stand out as unique. Of course, this effect can only be achieved if all the pieces are correctly assembled, and this is in no small part thanks to the wonderful direction and cinematography - which again create a rather soothing affect on the viewer. The two lead performances - especially Chalamet - are easily some of the best of 2017. In many ways, it's their performances that inhabit this world and make it feel fully-realised and, ultimately, real.\n\nI can't praise 'Call Me by Your Name' enough. It took me completely by surprise, and I can see this becoming an annual summer-time necessity for me. And I really want to visit Italy now.",

While there are committed performances that abound, no one actor really outshines the others and most of the acting is suitably naturalistic and basically blends into the images created by the DP. Whats immediately remarkable is the very sluggish pace and the exchanges between the central leads Timothee Chalamet and the supposedly much older Armie Hammer don't have the spark that's required to maintain a degree of focus on the story.

            "content": "A breezy summer romance and/or a coming-of-age tale that also explores the tentative worries and secret freedoms of same-sex attraction.  Oliver (Armie Hammer) is an American graduate student (or post-doc) who comes to stay in Italy for the summer of 1983 to do research with a professor (of archaeology or ancient civilisations, perhaps) and to live in the professor's summer chalet.  There he meets the professor's 17-year-old son, Elio (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet), and it is Elio's story that we follow.  Although it is not quite clear for most of the first half of the film, in which Elio and Oliver develop a hesitant friendship, each is attracted to the other. You can feel the awkwardness when Elio finds a way to dance near Oliver during the Psychedelic Furs' Love My Way at a local dance (and yes, \"there's an Armie on the dancefloor\" indeed).  For Elio, this is likely to be his first affair with a man (and he initially responds to his own feelings by losing his virginity to a female admirer) but we don't quite know about Oliver - he is a mystery to us as well as to Elio.  As the movie progresses, so does their relationship.  James Ivory's Oscar-winning screenplay fortunately does not deal in stereotypes and the characters and their up-and-down relationship feel human and real.  Italy itself seems a fantasy world - and as all summers end, so too must the fantasy (although the wise and sensitive parents encourage Elio to cherish his memories).  I'm not really a big romance movie watcher and although this film avoided most (if not all) of the clich\u00e9s of the genre, it was the final shot (over which the credits roll and the music of Sufjan Stevens plays) that really elevated the whole film to something special.  It was at that moment that I remembered what it was like to be a heartbroken teen in the '80s.",

            "content": "Beyond the waters of the first love \n\nWho would dare to refute that this universal feeling doesn't dwell in the soul and mind of every thinking being? In any of its variables or possible presentations, it's used as a verb and predicate from the genesis of life, therefore, it has been adapted and represented by a subject in infinite ways which take the name: art. Here is a question: what type of art doesn't contain love for reality, for fiction, for the utopian? Painting to reflect the beauty of nature, sculpture to symbolize the tidiness of bodies, music to interpret the power of sounds, dance to praise the synchronicity of moves, writing to digest the fantasies of humanity. Likewise, the seventh art, the one that appeals to each and every one of these above, has also had the opportunity to join the party. Films, an imitation of reality, have opened doors to stories of any kind, working with the three-key-components requirement (setup, confrontation, and resolution) which are motivated vehemently by love for audiovisual production and life. Fables invented by humans, about humans and for humans. What we do bind us as a society, creates a spirit of community, we all survive at the expense of others, and those others of others, it's a cyclical chain that unifies us and we don't realize, we will, when relentless materialism and selfishness edge love out. Some ambitious films have wanted to reflect this. However, other films, even more ambitious, decided to have a quick dip in habitual paths, but posing poignant, real own visions about relationships, unimaginable in the hopeless' eyes. Such is the case of intimist filmmaker Luca Guadagnino and his latest film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival last year, a story that breathes desire, but also discomfort.\n\nAdapting one of the most emblematic books written by Andre Aciman, the story invites us to the hottest days of the summer of 1983 in northern Italy, stifling daytimes on which Elio, an American boy marveled by music and its history, moves lazily transcribing scores and flirting with some girls. However, his monotonous holiday will take a twist by an unexpected visit, that, without wondering, would fill with color, pleasure and pain the life of the young boy. It's Oliver, a highbrow student who in pursuit of his doctorate, is staying in Perlman's summer mansion in order to be an intern tasked with helping Elio's father, a professor specializing in Greco-Roman culture. And as days pass by, the friendship of the two young people will be strengthened without control, living not only a good time of leisure, but also the awakening of sexual maturation, destiny acceptance and identity formation, events that affect the cyclical but special lives of each character, especially, the protagonists of this transformative journey.\n\nThere are awful, bad, regular, admissible, good and excellent adapted screenplays. This belongs to that last lucky category. Adapting Aciman's words is not easy, I would say that it would be an unfilmable material, and not precisely in visual terms, it's actually the narrative and emotional weight that requires a reliable adaptation. \"Eight White Nights\" American writer has shown a particular delicacy describing the situations on paper, uses language and technique in a compact and naturally functional way, his narrations seem to breathe life in images, in real images. That's why James Ivory's screenplay deserves gold recognition, because, with the duty to be up to the vision of the author, the level of demand was considerably further, however, there was no risk whatsoever here. Based on a customary but effective mold, the plot has a traditional structure until the third act, because the resolution seems to get us back, emerging more problems, knowing such difficulties are mere vehicles used by the author to represent an irrefutable truth: real life isn't a fairy tale and will never be; at least, it was for half an hour. There are several tools implanted in the script that demonstrate a radical change to the romance genre, because, just like \"The Big Sick\" did, exposes the flourishing of a relationship in a tangible truth, I.E., around a panorama in which any of the viewers would live, unfriendly neighbors, relentless destinies, disappointments transformed into hope.  It often ends in a \"realistic\" way, but we don't get ahead of it, and let's return to the beginning. Elio's tale is simple, not flat, he's a boy like any other, resigned to the emotions and warmth of the heat wave in his parents' holiday home; reading, playing, taking baths in the icy river and pedaling through the emblematic Mediterranean alleys. The touching and formally important thing about this character arrives when Oliver pops up in the place because he's the one who sets off the deep journey that the protagonist and the spectator will undertake. From the first scenes, this young man connects with the audience by means of his simplicity, candor and austerity, he's a teenager who simply lives music throughout summer, and then possibly the other, and the other, and so the same way until he typecast in the group of people who lives the moment and dies as a response to fate. Oliver is the key to a necessary abyss, because not only mean the awakening of a new sexual dimension, but also the awakening of maturation, acceptance, pain; love isn't always pure happiness. And we see that Eliot's life is rebuilt every time he is in Oliver's company in an ordinary, but beautiful way, he portrays what many young people may be experiencing now. Ivory didn't be seduced by sexual superficiality or bland approach on sodomy, he cuts out from the book the necessary stuff to conceive each line with patience, slowly but with a dynamic pace that achieves that the spectator, independently its gender or sexual identity, is reflected in the mortal desires of this pair of characters, makes us complicit in a thorny spiral that ends in a concerted fantastic point. There is no complete catharsis for Eliot because the movie doesn't represent a purgative experience for anyone, what the film aims to show is the vulnerability of feelings, regardless of race, color or flavor; we are indelible in the face of danger, we can always be hunters but also preys. As far as Oliver is concerned, from a distant and quite objective perspective, many would identify him as a supporting character, and although in part he is, the writer knows very well how to endow argumentative importance the limited cast, so he doesn't feel like a mere addition, as a tool, is someone vital to the story, someone who equally experiences not only sexual but emotional discoveries, is a three-dimensional invention that wants to have a \"summer love\", even so, if his life breaks apart. In the end, many people may think that Oliver got a happy ending, however, before a more acute and committed perspective, it was fully concluded that he is not, they will understand if they analyze in depth the telephone talk scene, it's not joy or simplicity what we notice in their voices, which have changed fully.\n\nSeparate mention must be made of certain scenes that borders on the memorable. The pictures get a solid position in the story, thus, the conception and the approach of those moments play a vital role in different but powerful ways. From vitality-radiating lines to power-expelling dialogues, each moment builds one more pillar in the plot, no matter how insignificant may seem - there's a lot for the ordinary spectator surely, - they keep an intrinsic meaning correlated with the characters. I have selected just one and not randomly, this is starring Eliot and one peach. But, what does a peach turn into something so disruptive and disturbing, as Oliver would have said: (its scientific name, Prunus persica, literally means \"Persian plum\", as it is closely related to the plum)? Enough. Those who have seen the film will immediately understand what I'm talking about and although it seems that this scene simply finds its raison d'\u00eatre in the mania to disturb the audience, it's not, rather, its meaning expresses the doubts and experiments passing through his mind due to the moment in which he is, this scene insinuates Elio's final elections. It's a scene that, free from morbidness or stupefaction that it causes, has become lodged in my head, and not only my head, it 's curious to write in my browser \"peach\" and run into content related to the film. Interestingly, not all the best situations have to do with intrepid sexual stuff, because although in this field slides quite well, are those in which the reality spits us in the face, in which we see ourselves reflected our past or our present. Without a doubt, an intimate and very important achievement for adapted-screenplay stories.\n\nThe performances are, beforehand, a foretold delight. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is off the charts as Eliot, the sincerity and fidelity that this young actor- who participates in two of the films nominated in the Academy Awards this year -imbues into the extracted-from-the-book character are overwhelming, establishing himself as the promising young of the moment, since with that final scene he ratifies a commendable tour de force. There is no doubt that the film wouldn't be the same without his simplicity and natural charisma, what is more, it'd be nothing because Chalamet is the whole film, his interpretation steals all the attention, even the praises that were directed towards enormous - figurative and literally - Armie Hammer. Over the years, we have seen that Hammer, a great Californian actor, has been able to balance the roles he signs up for, that is to say, has not been categorically opted for indie leads, therefore, taking part from Guy Ritchie's hyperactive stories to Boots Riley's narrative ferocity. It seems that the actor has taken on a big challenge with Oliver, one that means transmute himself internally with sensitivity and moral complexity. Hammer could catch much more attention if his character wasn't tied to the actions of the protagonist, however, with the great work done, in the same way you can notice an intoxicating and even captivating determination.  Without hesitation, the chemistry between these two actors is mind-boggling and really unexpected, absolutely neither one of the scenes in which they shares screen feels synthetic, ridiculous or unnatural, nor those in which eroticism takes precedence, each part is propelled by the commitment and talent of these passionate actors, who, without necessarily being homosexual, builds a beautiful and intimate portrait about what love means, getting above barriers or stigmas. It's worth mentioning the fascinating work of the protagonist's parents, Amira Casar and Michael Stuhlbarg, especially the father's due to his tearful monologue, brimming with understanding and power, he expresses and encloses unusual skills.\n\nAnother fundamental cornerstone, truly fundamental is called Luca Guadagnino. We know that the Sicilian filmmaker is prone to tales of love, words like 'frivolous' or 'plastic' will never be used as adjectives to describe his stories. Not for nothing, the filmmaker was seduced by the potential that Aciman's work had, it was a great opportunity and more than a commitment to his work, was gladness and a debt to his homeland, a promise residing in it. The man who always worked with fabulous Tilda Swinton as his muse on movies as \"A Bigger Splash\" or \"I Am Love\" - oddly she doesn't collaborate in any way this time, - is the one who refocused and erected what film-adaptation \"Call Me by Your Name \" is today, he gets to align drama and comedy so organic that we almost forget the two-hour-and-twelve-minute runtime, The perception of time is absent thanks to the human and effective immersion that the filmmaker offers us to experience from the initial credits, those where the names of the surprisingly few involved are drawn on photographs of Greek and Roman sculptures to the sound of vibrating pieces. The filmmaker's sensibility and inscrutability make the film an irreplaceable, pessimistic and wonderful, deep and amusing, reflective and peculiar time; the best film of the director and genre in recent years, no doubt about it.\n\nThe naturalism and spectacularity of the pictures are predominant in the movie, the pride of the director is evident when filming in his mother country, because he goes into raptures leaving the camera in a static position even after the characters are no longer in front of it. The screen teems with Italian culture colors, the yellows from summer or clover greens from the natural landscapes are perceived and enjoyed thanks to the fine and communicative talent of Thai cinematographer Sayombhu Mukdeeprom and the entire art and production department led by Roberta Federico. Adopting as a rule the use of a single pair of specific lenses, mostly for the most beautiful dreamscapes in the country, the creative team weaves a visually intrepid and artistically unique look, because apart from making known an already-classical culture unintentionally, it delivers images that express more than words, namely, inserting tacit messages, forcing the viewer to codify and appreciate them. Visually, it's not an easy film, far less exhaustive, the true beauty is in the lack of artificiality, everything is emphatically vivacious, coherent with the beauty of the writing, proposing angles and constant soft focuses to set in the focal spot it needs, a skillfully functional strategy; likewise, it represents that intimate and relaxed aura of the book, altering minimally the contents from this one, portraying the story and its purposes with incomparable knack, a slap for \"Fifty Shades of Grey\", although, there is no comparison.\n\nThe soundtrack is also very well developed, with the anomaly of having two completely rewardable original songs. Every year, I've coincided with the winner of the BOS in the Academy Awards, because without thinking, I end up listening to the memorable song from the winner film on and on again. Last year, 'City of Stars' or 'Audition' from \"La La Land\" become my addiction, now, something strange happens because although \"Mystery of Love\" by Sufjan Stevens is nominated alongside great contenders from Disney, Netflix, and other indie studios, I feel and I think that either \"Remember Me\" from \"Coco\" or this fabulous song should take home a little golden man. Both transmit vulnerability and power on par, sadness and happiness on par, these two melodies have such a clear meaning in the scene they are placed, everything shines in a majestic way. One of the most beautiful, intimate and special compositions of the year.\n\nPersonally, \"Call Me by Your Name\" could be the \"Brokeback Mountain\" for a new generation and not for its realistic approach to the portrait of virility or the importance of any person's feelings, but by the vastness of messages (truths) that a simply deep story can say, a change, that's what it wants. \n\n\"Call Me by Your Name\" by Luca Guadagnino invigorates again homosexual-love stories in cinema by means of a staggering coming-of-age, led by a terrifying interpretation of Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and a shrewd and very personal eye of a director who fortifies his filmography, while it's one of the most faithful and emotionally charged film adaptations of the last century, proving that even if you have a pre-established foundation, originality, passion and creativity in the artistic field are vital for a motion picture which reaches a whole new level of emotional power, here, an example. Getting rid of taboos, this film is one of the most human, magnetic and heartfelt movies about teenagers and love I have seen in my short life, one that leaves opportunities for more bold and talented writers, actors, directors or any kind of artists to raise their hands and say: Here I am and this is my story.",

            "content": "\"Call me by your name, and I'll call you by mine.\" I'll never fully understand what that line means. Based on the novel of the same name, Call Me By Your Name is a coming-of-age romantic drama that follows 17-year-old Elio (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) as he develops a relationship with his father's summer intern, 24-year-old Oliver (Armie Hammer). What's great is that both characters don't struggle with their sexuality, and they don't act like coming to terms with their sexuality is the end of the world. It became solely about love instead of a coming out story. Yes, there's initial rejection from Oliver, but that never caused an abundant amount of tension. The movie isn't too dramatic. This story is about experiencing first love. The film doesn't follow the typical romance storyline of meeting someone, falling in love, fighting for some reason, then falling back in love again. Somehow, it's realistic because the two don't actually end up together, which also helps with the narrative of experiencing first love. This film witnesses Elio's and Oliver's everyday life. Nothing feels forced. At times, it felt like I was watching a beautifully shot music video. It's short and sweet and gets to the point. What I didn't like is how I felt teased throughout the whole film and never truly got the satisfaction I needed. The movie has a different kind of intensity, and that intensity never dies down. Usually, that's a good thing, but in this case, I would've wanted to feel a little more closure in the end. Now, I've been talking about it being a first love story, but \"love\" is a big word. What's supposed to be true love looked more like a fling, so it was hard to feel heartbreak at the end. My heart didn't twist until the credits when Elio looks over the fire with complete pain in his eyes. It seemed that Elio was more into Oliver than Oliver was into Elio. Maybe that's why their goodbye didn't resonate with me.\n\n---\nFOLLOW ME ON https://www.instagram.com/movietvstance/",

He looked like he was in his 30's and it was extremely uncomfortable to watch him and his teenage co-star in the sex scenes. It was creepy and felt so pervy! Ugh.

Call Me By Your Name is these in the extreme, as very little happens in this movie as far as plotting or tension-building as protagonist Elio finds summer love with a visiting scholar living with his family in the Italian countryside. The pacing can be too slow at times, but the tension comes not from the plot but from the viewer, as Elio continues to lounge, swim, and read we feel a sense of the ticking clock of inevitability for as summer wanes, and wait for the other shoe to drop.  When it does, the conclusion is understated and poignant, an unbroken close-up take on Elio, as a parental monologue from the previous scene rings in the viewer's head.  Timothy Chalamet is a revelation as Elio, capturing the teenage fa\u00e7ade of nonchalance and confidence covering insecurities, desire and curiosity. One small thread that sticks with me is that early on in the movie, Elio sees visiting scholar Oliver wearing a Star of David necklace and comments that his family is not as outward about their Judaism; later in the film, Elio starts wearing a Star of David necklace of his own. Small touches like this fill out characters in a movie that doesn't dig often into feelings or backstory through dialogue.",

Im not sure if its  the promotion, but having an idea of what kind of love story it was and already wanting to watch it play it may be key. I did sit down to watch this with that kind of intrigue. Call Me By Your Name does do a wonderful job portraying a unique love story. There is essentially no subplot in this movie. Characters backgrounds and stories really have nothing to do with the main plot and therefor at first makes it seem confusing to figure out whats going on. That doesnt matter tho as the two main leads do a superb job drawing you in and wanting to see how their relationship will unfold. Its a tale of first love and while sometimes that can be heartbreaking, remembering that will leave you with a sense of hope. This movie told its unique story from start all the way to the exact finish point of the credits in a very unique way I have yet to see. Leaving me running through all the emotions. This Oscar nominated movie deserves all its accolades and possibly should have even got the win for outstanding picture. It deserves and did win Best Adapted Screenplay written by 89 year old James Ivory. With a good rewatchablilty factor Call Me By Your Name will definitely get a good conversation going between you and your movie buff friends as we try to discover the meaning of certain scenes.",

No matter how hard I try to understand the difficulty about coming out while you're living in a society full of crap,I just can't. People gonna be people and they will keep doing the same things they do for god knows how long. So I'm seriously glad that they didn't make it about this twisted society. I'm glad that they didn't give any credits to these douchebags.\nAlthough the fiction has some gaps I guess I like the movie. ***SPOILER***  When I was half of the movie I believed them and with that kind of feelings they can get through it all, but well, they didn't. They didn't fight for each other,fight for their love because there isn't one, at least for Oliver. This isn't something I can accept as love. I've been thinking like \"Aww it's a skinny love!\" Which means -in modern-tech world- when two people are in love with each other but too shy or can't own their love for some other reason. But unfortunately there was only one person who's in love.\nI hate,I mean with all my heart and soul hate the fact that Oliver got engaged. Because that way I felt cheated,I felt cheated because you can't tell someone you love him/her and act like you mean it in summer and then get engaged by winter. This is hypocrisy! \nBut I guess all those bullshits are the reasons why I like that movie. Because life isn't a fairytale and no one gets their happy endings. Friends stab you in the back, people you care about die, you go crazy because you can't handle it anymore but worst of all; you fall in love. Because love is an illusion and people always leave,especially the ones you make you believe that they will stay. You don't need words to make promises. Actions speak louder than words. \nThat's why I like and hate that movie at the same time. Because it was more than a movie. It was a story of someone who's seeking someone to love and be loved by.",

That is the case with Call Me By Your Name, which is easily one of the best movies of the year. It's practically flawless, every shot oozing with sensuality. Its biggest strength is its simplicity and heart, depicting a relationship between two guys that you don't dare to question. It rolls off the tip of your tongue with its clear dialogue and incredible editing. It also has a deep understanding of what gay attraction is usually based on: not so much on the overt expressions of care but the simple nuances, the light touches and the mischievous exchange of looks. Moreover, it's a highly progressive movie which not only is sound from an ideological point of view but also depicts a relationship untamed by age or gender. It understands sexual orientation as fluid. The sexuality is a moving matter that floats through the screen and interleaves the scenes together making it the most tense movie of the year (no horror movie comes close). It has a deep understanding that the smallest of action is elevated to a degree of the highest importance when everything else seems mundane. It's a highly personal film to me and one that I will enjoy rewatching. Specially for gay men, that last scene with Elio's father will hit harder than anything else, as you feel the weight of the acceptance you long for. The warm cinematography works together with fine-tuned performances and an incredible direction to make a film that is so ethereal that you feel like you've spent a whole summer in Italy. Call Me By Your Name is the kind of movie we should be supporting, it's the kind of movie we shouldn't be afraid to watch.

There is supposed to be about a 5 or 6 year age difference between the characters, but Hammer looks at least 15 years older - it gives the whole story a slightly creepy, predatory vibe, which was clearly not the intent.

Surely it had a great setting in Italy, in a wonderful villa, and near an interesting village and all in all, that part of it had an almost dreamlike quality..  As far as the attraction between the two leads, I really don't see it. I think the relationship was rather stilted and I didn't much real heat, chemistry or tenderness between them.   \n\nI just found the relationship between Oliver and Elio to be more stage managed than it evolving naturally.  \n\nI honestly, at one point found the film to be tedious and almost decided to stop watching, to go find either another program or another movie.\n\nPersonally, I did not find the film to be all that enjoyable or memorable.  \nObviously, I am in the minority in this regard, but I just have to give my honest view of the film. \n\nPersonally, I cannot recommend it.",

In fact one actually won Best Picture from the Oscars last year. So in order to make Call Me By Your Name stand out from the crowd, they added a little something extra. All you need is some statutory rape, and now you have something new! It\u2019s kind of hard to express how uncomfortable that made this film. I don\u2019t know if for some reason people have given it a pass because it\u2019s Italy in the 1980s and there were some looser rules about the age of consent there, but I don\u2019t get it. Also the way they integrate the title into the film is ham-fisted and dumb. It doesn\u2019t help that the story is dreadfully boring, because there is zero focus put on anything happening beside this young man\u2019s love life. Passing references are made to why Armie Hammer\u2019s character is there, but we never see anyone do work, or anything other than waiting for the next illicit encounter. It\u2019s enough to put you to sleep unless you are deeply invested in Timothee Chalamet\u2019s character or performance. He was perfectly fine acting in the role, especially for his young age, but he didn\u2019t have many character traits aside from horny. In every way Call Me By Your Name is the kind of boring artsy independent film that I expect to be loved by critics, and hated by me. Then it had an extra level of awkwardness that made it even worse for me. So it lived up to my expectations, and I suspect you\u2019ll be able to tell whether it will work for you based on this short review.",

Beautifully shot, evocative of a lazy, lovestruck summer month in the gorgeous Italian countryside, it's a thoughtful, peaceful slice of bittersweet romance if not a terribly active one. Strangely edited, we'll cut away in the middle of a conversation but linger for long stretches of scenery and minor character actions. That does effectively convey the boy's listlessness, his adolescent ennui within a magnificent family estate, but it also leads to major pacing problems. Though it runs just over two hours, I caught myself glancing at the clock after one. Our two leads, Elio (the boy) and Oliver (the intern), share the flicker of chemistry, but initially flirt with so much nuance and subtext that I thought I'd missed something when it came time for their inevitable heart-to-heart. The climax is excellent, with a charged, open-hearted monologue from Elio's father and an unforgettable close-up during the credits, but by that point I was more than ready to check out. Long, tedious, occasionally rewarding and very, very art house.",

But we do get constant glimpses of chiseled inner thighs. \"Thanks\" for that\n-The dialogue is slow, weird, unnatural. Who talks like that? It's just a mumble jumble of quasi-intellectual phrases. \n-the non existing chemsitry between elio and oliver. why do they fall in love? they dont talk, they dont know anything about each other. it makes no sense.\n-the mother, who is she? what is her job? she quotes hellenistic philosophers in german , smokes  a lot, drinks a lot of wine and looks pretty. this picture completely fails in giving any kind of depth in the women actors. it's embarrassing.\n-elios  girlfriend and the lack of logic in: 1. falling in love with a beautiful young boy 2. being heartbroken for about five seconds. 3. then shaking hands and smile and say \"we can be friends forever\". what on earth happened there?\n-the father. aloof and absently smiling and in the end having a pretentious \"talk\" with his son about enjoying life. it's embarrassing. yikes. \n-the pace. it's so slow. slow does not equal interesting.\n-the peach scene is obnoxious.\n-there is no plot. they are rich, beautiful, intelligent, well off and the summer villa is pretty and the scenery is ravishing... i mean it's too saccarine. i feel sick.\n-the villagers are just objects, a picturesque background. like items. its condescending as f***\n\nthis is a really really bad movie.",

Both begin to grow feelings for one another and the film explores this relationship, both physically and emotionally for the rest of its run time. The film can move at a slow pace from time to time, but this is because the movie spends great lengths of time building the relationship between the two protagonists. Both actors put in strong performances and are proving to be two of Hollywood's bright young actors. The cinematography is also amazing, as it captures the beauty of 1980's Italy perfectly. This also drives the film, as many of the locations and shots add to the story and relationship between Elio and Oliver. The film has many modern connections, which is part of its popularity and award buzz. This is also another drawback to the film, as there are many scenes clearly looking for Oscar buzz. Overall, though Call Me By Your Name is a good movie with gorgeous cinematography and solid performances by its two leads, while also providing a story that connects well to modern society.",

I didn't card about any of these people, who simply go swimming in ponds and streams as their only activity. Insulting plot line from start to finish. Shocked this got many good reviews. Seems to be that any gay themed well filmed movie will do well these days. Timothe\u00e9 was excellent, but nothing spectacular. Hammer was a waste in this.

I didn't feel the need to say much after seeing the film, however, after seeing that's it's up for best picture, I'd like to share my thoughts, and question why the public seems to find the film so fantastic. During the entire length of the film, to , there is a burden of style. While extremely aesthetic, (the beautiful picture perfect Italian scenery) it distracts to the point that it seems to be the main target of the film. This cinematic aspect didn't allow me to get into the actual story but  kept me caged in the idea of the film, rather than simply engaged.The second, and more important flaw in the film is not only the acting but the script, and the storyline specifically. We jump into the fantastical love story of these two men before we've heard them have an actual conversation, which they never even seem to have. The words they share feel scripted, unreal, and to me held little substance. Midway through the film, I was aware they seemed deeply in love, but frankly, I just didn't believe it. Perhaps, however, in the end, what matters most is what the movie makes you feel. It is not about the little things you liked or disliked throughout the film, but the small moments where something in you stopped, and truly felt something on a level residing deeper than thought. I truly, cannot say for a moment that this film made me feel a thing emotionally. This is why I feel the need to ask the public an honest question. Did this film truly impact you, did it truly inspire you, could you really lose yourself in it? Or is it simply the idea of this film that is so likable. The aesthetic, the genre, the music, the shots, etc... I want to ask this question not because I am so entitled to my opinion, but really because I feel so confused as to why this film has the highest of reviews. I would like to compare to another LBGTQ film for those who would want to oppose my opinions in saying it is because of the film's genre. The film Brokeback mountain, a type of love story also shared between two men, completely sucked me in. There were at least three times in the film were I was fully in tears, where I wasn't thinking about the film or the way it was done, times where I wasn't thinking at all. These were true moments of great film where the storyline led me to understand the characters struggles, desires, and deepest sides, and where I couldn't help but feel the emotions they seemed to feel themselves. If you've made it this far through the review, thank you for taking the time to hear what I have to say! I am not a film critic, this is true, and I do not write for a magazine, however, simply because everyone else is in love with a film does not mean that you have to be. Please, honestly, ask yourself if this movie was truly as brilliant as you have made it out to be.",

Michael Stuhlbarg was great. He really deserves more lead roles. \n\nThe fathers monologue at the end was really lovely and touching. Very moving. Such a unique take on the father of a gay son. loved the words not spoken in that scene. \n\nThe director did this things couple of times when he would cu the scene short before the connection between the two leads would happen. Like at the end of the piano scene when Elio spins on the bench to engage and the scene cuts. And when they are down by the river and Elio jumps on Olivers back and immediately the scene cuts. i dont know what that was about. never cam to fruition though.\n\nI didnt really buy the connection or attraction. elio was too shy and oliver was pretty uninvolved. his shoulder touch which he touts as a come on.... really wasnt enough for anyone to know if they were interested.  i just never saw the spark anywhere really.\n\nwhat was the whole call me by your name thing? maybe this is just my own bias, but it tied in, for me, to the egotistical thing for gay people. he wanst to have sex with himself. thought it was weird. \n\nthe masturbating in the fruit scene was hysterical. amazing. \n\nthe scene in the tree where they are reminiscing about getting together was kind of cheap. the movie was better and more interesting than that fodder. that being said, it was very real and felt so right.\n\nsuch an interesting and unique look at human emotions. it was much more a movie about humans and how we react to things tan it was a bot being gay or coming of age.",

There is a much older man (Armie Hammer) staying with his family over the summer.  Elio is still learning who he is as a person, especially with his sexuality, and they begin to spend more and more time together.  I know what you're probably thinking: this is just this year's gay Oscar movie.  I know that's what I was thinking before I watched this.  Well, you're not wrong, but it is a lot more than that, and there are many other major reasons why there are so many people who have fallen so deeply in love with this.  From the description, I thought that this was going to be this year's An Education.  It's not really quite that, and I think that this is something better.  Even though there is a rather large age disparity between these two, it never feels at any point like either of these two are doing anything wrong.  It's a forbidden romance and taboo to be sure, but it is all initiated by Elio, so it never at any point in time feels predatory.  These two actors have great romantic chemistry with each other, and they are both straight in real life, so that speaks volumes to their acting abilities.  I know Armie needed a hit in a big way, so it's good to see him succeeding.  Chalamet is definitely an actor to keep an eye on, and I am all but certain that he is going to break even further into the mainstream in these upcoming years, so keep your eyes open for him.  I also have to give a big tip of my hat to one of my favorite character actors working today, Michael Stuhlbarg.  He plays only a small part here as the Elio's father, but he comes in and gives what I consider to be the monologue of the year as this is wrapping up, and it is an emotional punch that you hold on to long after you have stopped watching.  In fact, it is giving me chills simply thinking about it.  This is an intimate film that makes you feel lucky that you found it.  It's all about sexuality, but at the same time, it doesn't make a big deal about these characters being gay.  It is just who they are, and I love that about this.  It is a positively gorgeous film; not that I think this is a difficult feat to make Italy look great mind you, but I most definitely want to travel there now, and that's not just because everybody who lives there never seems to be working in this.  The runtime is a bit on the long side, but this isn't something I'm deducting points for, as I was in it from start to finish.",

The acting skills of Timothee Chalamet is Oscar-worthy, but the film itself skates on thin ice. Of course the writer chose to set the story during the 80ies, so the easiness of social media wouldn't interfere with the theme of the movie: crying about the fear of losing someone you love. With that being sad it feels like the movie itself is stuck in that whole time genre, basically it's a movie which could have been made 20 years ago.Nothing new, nothing refreshing, especially for this era where being gay is more accepted overall. Strangely enough I would prefer Brokeback Mountain above this film, although I thought that film was too much Oscar-focused finding a way to introduce the theme to a bigger audience. This is 2018, let's just make movies where being gay is integrated and we don't make a big deal about it anymore? How about a superhero movie where the main character is a black gay man? But then of a better quality than 'Black Panther' of course. Anyway, I watched the whole movie, I did not walk out of the cinema and that's a good sign. @Korben_Dallas on Twitter",

Unlike the other Oscar-nominated films, this movie is less of a melodrama, less of commercial appeal and is not overhyped in today's modern cinema. There are no highly explosive dialogues in this film, no action-filled scenes or death-defying stunts to keep the moviegoers' adrenaline level on the upswing.  Nevertheless, Call Me By Your Name has succeeded in effectively communicating the universal message of love that transcends beyond the socio-demographic barriers of the major characters. \n\n        As an academics in the field of humanities, I believe this movie exemplifies a literary masterpiece where all elements of the story (time, place and characters) are coherently interwoven into the development of a central theme that is so magnificently articulated in the ending. The complexity of Chamalet's role is more than enough to earn him an outstanding recognition from any award-giving bodies. Moreover, there is a great deal of social relevance on Stuhlbarg's monologue at the ending scene that may be worthy of emulation for parents with children who are facing identity crisis. \n\n       The elements of the film resonate the attributes of many old Hollywood classics where most audience nowadays are no longer accustomed with. In this film, the director, Luca Guadagnino beautifully paints a portrait of what John Keats, has yearn for in one of his poems: \"Give me books, fruit, French wine, fine weather, and a little music . . .\"  So, what else could you ask for more in this movie?\n\n       What makes this movie truly great is the singularity of the main idea and the colourful tapestry of sceneries amidst the leisurely pacing of scenes, and the richness of visuals and imagery based on the character's dialogues from James Ivory's poetic script.  The film is not pretentious but rather presents a raw but finely detailed description and honest portrayal of human emotion in its purest form. Overall, I give this film a 99% rating. It's a true work of art.",

It took me right back to the last, balmy summer spent in Italy - drinking up the sun and soaking up philosophy texts. Everything from the colour grading to the cinematography and the soundtrack. Oh my gosh, the mix of euphoric classical and folksy, indie love songs is perfect.\n\nI am a tad concerned about the age difference but I mean, Oliver turns out to be a little bit of a dick at the end anyway.\n\nThe family is perfect and this movie really just does some great relationships.

It pairs a skinny 17-year-old boy, Elio, whose attempts at nonchalance only emphasize his vulnerability; and a 24-year-old (30s-looking) man, Oliver, who, with his bland expression, muscled physique and breezy personality embodies a man who is eminently self-contained. He is visiting for six weeks to help the boy's father with his archaeological research. \nWhat captivated me about this movie was its recurring theme of inside and outside, closed and open, private and public. It opens in the lush private grounds of their Italian Villa, within which meals, parties, games and laughter abound. Inside this encircling space there are more hidden spots: an abandoned room, a grotto, a leafy orchard. The road out is traveled on the ultimate open-air transportation, a bike, through spacious countryside to the nearby town. But the town and the countryside also provide private spots for hidden embraces; secrets are everywhere and nowhere. \n Elios \"secret\" crush on Oliver seems to be known by everyone, including his parents, who signal their sophistication by smoking and encouraging him to follow his desires while he is young and attractive. Meanwhile, as Elio, under his cocky adolescent persona, struggles to contain the chaos within, we witness his insides being released to the exterior: a nosebleed, vomit, ejaculate, and finally, tears, while around him the comfortable, exclusive life of his polyglot family and their friends obviously glides on.  \nThis story is a skillfully done, visually beckoning tragedy, and has very little sympathy for the victim.",

You get the tasteful, beautifully shot cinema-photography, which is always one of the stars of a Merchant-Ivory movie, you get the \"up-scale, upper crust\" characters. Everyone in this movie lolls about in chaise lounges and the like while languidly puffing on cigarettes or drinking wine. And you get the arty-farty qualities (this one includes the main character playing classical music on the piano while wearing Talking Head tee-shirts; his father is a well to do professor into collecting artifacts, history, and vaguely snooty word origins. Superseded over this familiar, lovely (in this case, Italian villa) setting we have a nominally gorgeous, young Redfordish visitor catching the eye of a young man in the throes of his true sexual awakening. The women are props; they are neither mistreated, nor are they  other than part of the eye candy (for heterosexual men, I gather); they are just there to calm the nerves of movie-goers who may fear they have stumbled into a movie that is entirely too homo for their tastes. The real action is the boys, cavorting in the midst of waterfalls, casting doe-like glances at one another, and falling in love in a tasteful, foreign post card sort of way. I felt benumbed for the most part; this was an awfully predictable movie, and we are meant to relate tot he youthful romantic angst and confusion of its young main character, who is shirtless throughout 80% of the movie. (Someone connected with this movie has a thing for young, very  pale, skinny boys with big hair and moody eyes). It's an entirely lovely cinematic rendering of a young gay man's first experience of a same-sex crush and love's delicious and delirious insanity. The sex is kept at a minimum for the squeamish; the art crowd audience prefers its sex suggested off-camera or implied in pretty, symbolic metaphors. I found myself riveted exactly once during this movie, in which my own lust was more toward the food and wine than the actors. (never mind the term \"size queen; if you are a \"thighs queen\" you will be in hog heaven; the men wear shorts throughout).: the scene in which the professorial, rather prissy Father lights up yet another cigarette to\n talk \"man to man\" with his son in order to assure him he is quite aware of what his son is going through is where the movie delivers its one and only knockout punch. Daddy gets it; daddy really gets it. This movie might well be re-titled \"O Lucky Boy\",for he has the best parents ever.... but watch out for the gardener! He is an old Italian gent who squints askance at everyone as if he is working at an insane asylum. Maybe he is just horny too, as every male in the movie seems bored with the placid scenery and dull  routines of gracious Italian estate living. This is another in a long lineage of films about male to male attraction that makes the subject totally palatable to a movie-going audience; it's a beautiful, swooning snore. Read \"Maurice\" (the book) instead; the same producers tacked that one. This one will get more accolades because the characters are depicted as at least moderately attracted to women. it is a lovely, if somewhat tedious snap-shot of homo-love just before the dark cloud of the epidemic was about to wreak its monstrous savagery.",

I loved how there were no close-ups of Olivier early on - we were getting to know him at the same time as other characters were. And how inspite of his brash, borderline rude demeanor half way through the film everyone on screen and me watching fall in love with him. The acting is restrained and real. My only complaint is that Armie Hammer may have been too restrained. I get it, Oliver is used to putting up a front and keeping his emotions tightly wrapped inside, but I felt a little bit of warmth could have gone a long way.",

The trailer was outstanding and the reviews promised an almost transcendental experience. I went into the theater after enjoying a fantastic meal and a nice glass of wine, completely ready to to fall in love. I was very disappointed.   \n     The movie moved at a snail's pace. It wasn't just a slow burn--it was like watching someone trying to light wet cardboard. I never felt the tension building between the two main characters. I simply didn't buy Elio and Oliver falling in love, which rendered the first quarter of the movie useless. Because I didn't buy their budding feelings, I wasn't excited when they actually did actually get together, and so I wasn't phased when the relationship failed. Because I never felt invested in the main relationship, there was just nothing for me to care about.\n     Chalamet acted his ass off--I bought him completely. Honestly, I put a lot of the blame Hammer--his performance was stiff, wooden, inauthentic, and, in some scenes, downright creepy. To be clear, I wasn't bothered by the age gap between the two main characters (Though, to be fair, Hammer is CLEARLY a 30-something-year-old pretending to be in his twenties, and Chalamet looked unsettlingly young by comparison) or the fact that it was a gay relationship, or anything like that. Hammer was just so cold--I never got the sense that he really cared about poor Elio one way or another. In quite a few scenes, Oliver came off as though he understood the depths of Elio's emotions and had simply decided to manipulate those emotions for his own physical gratification.\n     The movie screwed up the nosebleed scene, which was my favorite scene in the book. It started out great: I loved the jabbering Italian couple, and the frantic swinging of the camera, and all the smoke--it was very hectic and fun, but how do you NOT include a single shot of Oliver rubbing Elio's feet under the table, movie? What caused the nosebleed then??? To anyone who didn't read the book, it must have looked like Elio randomly got a nosebleed, and Oliver decided to take credit for it because Oliver is a big old narcissist.\n     And I'm going to say it--the ending credit scene was ridiculous. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to leave or what, and so I was tricked into watching a character do nothing but weep into the camera for like, a solid five minutes. Why? What the hell was the point?\n     Also, I didn't like the soundtrack. I actually found it distracting in quite a few scenes because it didn't fit the tone of what was going on.\n    Visually, the movie was breathtaking, and the dad was a pretty cool guy--his speech towards the end was bomb, probably the best part of the movie. I just wish these aspects were in a better film.\n     Overall, I thought this movie was vastly overrated. I really, REALLY wanted to like it, too.",

The greatest weakness of this film was how incredibly boring it was.  Self-indulgent, repetitious, pretentious are only the first few adjectives that jump to mind.  Scenes have the significance of home movie footage. How many bicycle rides am I going have to take?. How many times are the characters going to go swimming? How many lingering shots of the main character brooding will I be I subjected to? And worse...for no reason.  Director would make a point in a scene. Then he'd make the same point in the next scene. Then, he'd do it again a third time.  I think the father's speech in the denouement might have been profound and important. I don't know. I was so flogged with bloated self-aware story-telling by that time I couldn't hear him.  The most profound example of this \"not knowing when to cut a scene or end a movie\" was in the credits themselves.Several people in the audience were checking their watches and phones while the camera lingers, lingers, lingers, lingers on the main characters face while the credits roll. Best picture? Please no. Please don't reward this boring, painful, self-conscious, saccharine mess.  I do not care about any controversy generated by the subject matter. It was dwarfed by the Tree of Life-level droning.  Edit: I just read a couple of the pro critic's reviews. I've never seen anyone trip over themselves so much trying to rationalize a bad movie. \"all texture and nuance.\" \"Never takes off but it doesn't have to.\"  Okay. What are they really saying?",

The main highlight of the script is not the story itself, quite the contrary, the film's plot is even common, a couple who falls in love in the summer, the film's main highlight is present in the character construction, especially in the character of Elio , his sexuality is practically constructed from scratch, just like his experiences, challenges and discoveries, and unlike most of the films that expose this subject always forcing an extreme sexualization, here we do not see here the awakening of desire until the final act, in a very playful and beautiful way, and his romantic pair, Oliver, is also a very well worked character, even if the same is not built from scratch, we still have the negation and the discovery around Oliver always. A good part of the film is that it does not force itself to touch on social issues, or discuss this or that, the film simply is what it is, and it brings an incredible naturalness and beauty to the work. With a soundtrack ruled by classical music, we have many symphonies already known by moviegoers, and even sometimes getting strange in some moments of the film, in the general context it is beautiful, especially when some tone is used acutely in a certain scene, scaring the viewer and character, it's as if the movie sometimes screams, \"Hey, do not sleep, look at me,\" and the film needs it, especially because of its slow pace, which seeks an exploration of the Italian landscapes, after half an hour nausea, the film could easily take about 20 minutes less. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Armie Hammer are great, the two actors have incredible chemistry, and a sexual tension that permeates both from beginning to end, both actors make a brilliant performance. A film that knows how to talk about discovery, a film that builds characters and then breaks them, as it happens in our lives, construction, victory and failure, a personification of our day day in a playful but visceral, passionate and grotesque, passionate and devastating way , although the film still has problems of rhythm and sound, is still a great film.",

Firstly, the end with Michael Struhlbarg is breaktaking and one of the most important moments in cinema. Armie Hammer subtle performance is brave in its command and vulnerability. He has moments of quiet that break your heart and you know EXACTLY what he's thinking. It's the quiet work that gets overlooked, but is pivotal to the emotional core of the film. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is a rare gem. He carries this movie in every way possible and is so powerful and charming that I can't believe he's 22 (now).

Based on the acclaimed 2007 novel of the same name by Andr\u00e9 Aciman, \u201cCall Me By Your Name\u201d is the story of a young man\u2019s self-discovery during the summer of 1983. Elio Perlman (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet), is a seventeen-year-old Jewish-American summering in Northern Italy with his family. Elio is an introspective bibliophile & musical prodigy, who spends much of the summer reading books & hanging out with his girlfriend, Marzia (Esther Garrel). When Elio\u2019s father (Michael Stulberg), a professor of archaeology invites Oliver (Armie Hammer), a 24-year-old American Jewish graduate student to stay with the family for the summer, Elio initially feels that he & Oliver have nothing in common. Gradually it becomes apparent that the two young men are drawn to each other & share a deep undeniable attraction that evolves into a seductive courtship. Directed by Luca Guadagnino & adapted to the screen by James Ivory, \u201cCall Me by Your Name\u201d is an emotionally poignant story of the pain and joy of self-discovery. The shots of the Italian countryside were idyllic. I wanted to get on a plane and go there! The performances from the cast were excellent. The love story between Elio & Oliver was tender and bittersweet. \u201cCall Me By Your Name\u201d is up for four Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Actor (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) Best Adapted Screenplay (James Ivory), & Best Original Song.

But, Then I realised that people outside of the United states have a totally different view on sexuality, and this type of older man young man, might be fairly common. As people are not as sexually oppressed as we are here, and are more open to different lifestyles.\n\nI did have a problem with a few things in the movie. Like the boy pursuing a female interest, while still lusting after his object of desire. I also found it strange that once he had him, it still wasn't enough for him. I don't know of any young kid who is trying to come to terms with his sexuality, who would do something like that. I also found his smoking and drinking at his age, and his parents knowing all along of his intentions a bit hard to swallow.\n\nI did find their relationship somewhat nice as it was, but kind of figured there would be the whole, now I am getting married soon speech, once again to water it down so mainstream movie goers won't wet their pants.\n\nI also kind of figured a certain someone in the film had some desires of his own. And, I knew that would come out eventually. Overall the acting in this movie was good. But, once again, I think they held back the man 2 man romance, and threw in the girl, so straight audiences could say, well at least he tried. So, they might feel sorry for him. The same as they did in Brokeback Mountain. At least they tried being straight..too bad it didn't work out.",

The incomparable James Ivory, who's nominated for Oscars adapted screenplay, also directed some of the great movies in the 80s such as Howards End, The Remains of the Day and Maurice. The director Luca Guadagnino in my opinion should have been nominated for best director as he did such a stupendous job bringing the book to the big screen.\nI came across a few (albeit clear minority) comments on this website that labeled this film as portraying pedophilia, similar to a tweet from James Woods (who at 60 dated a 16, and tried to pick up a 14). These philistines' fraud argument is purely based on Elio's age of 17 while Oliver is 24. \nPedophelia is legally defined as an adult's sexual preference for prepubescent children age 13 and younger, which is illegal. \nThis movie depicts an unconventional consensual romantic relationship between two men within the legal consensual age. \nAs the director Guadagnino said it well: \"There was a great review of the film by Anthony Lane in the New Yorker that said, in effect, that this movie is the antidote to the climate in which we are living, a climate in which power is a weapon used to crush other people and to exert the violence of your impulses. \"Call Me by Your Name\" is about consensual desire, discovery and a completely un-power-related relationship.\"\nIt would be too easy a route to take by making Elio 18 or 20. Art is not always pretty and conventional, often it's designed to disturb and shock and hence provoke critical thinking. Like Yale scholar Joseph Fischel said best: \"If we go down that censorious and unnuanced path with our art, very little will survive the trip\".",

Call Me By Your Name is soothing, light and hopeful film about a relationship within a brief period of time and it is shot within it stretching it over for more than 2 hours, seems a bit much even from an adopted novel. Timothy is brilliant in it and his breakdowns (surprisingly there are few of them) are amazing and his love track is portrayed with such an innocence that it might remind you of Jake and Heath from the Brokeback Mountain.

La storia \u00e8 molto semplice, ma risulta coinvolgente per la perfetta sincronia dei due attori protagonisti, anche se in alcune parti vengono spinti in situazioni un po' troppo esplicite per i miei gusti. Il monologo finale di un grande personaggio porta letteralmente la pelle d'oca, classificandosi come uno dei migliori dialoghi di quest'anno trascinando con facilit\u00e0 l'intero film verso la lista dei migliori dell'anno.",

Armie Hammer and Timothee Chalamet give incredible performances, so natural and casual, as to appear completely authentic. Michael Stuhlbarg gives another fantastic supporting performance and his late film monologue is stirring. Call Me By Your Name is not a big film in any sense.

So this type of mine set hindered me from fully understand & enjoy the story for what it was.\nSecond, the main theme that plays in the story was the first love, emotions that you feel during the course of the relationship. This is relatable to lots of people but to me it isn't. I had some people that I liked during in my life time and I have never moved forward & expressed romantic feeling towards them. So in a logical term, I know what first love look & feel like but never personally experienced, thus gives me a Blindspot and I have lack of perspective about first love. \n\nAfter I thought about for few days & talking to some people about it, I appreciate this film for what it want to say & grateful that I took this journey to contemplate and examine myself.

It is great that he is supportive, but I can't approve of a father who is basically telling his kid that what he had with an ADULT was the most special thing in the world, it gives the wrong message in relation to abusive power relations (Elio was only a child).

Armie Hammer has a charisma and \"I don't care\" attitude in this that isn't abrasive, but rather endearing. If he applied these acting chops to \"The Lone Rangers\" it might not have been a steaming pile of shit.

Beautiful to look at, a simple story which moves at a snail's pace, an overlong runtime and characters who almost look like they care about what is going on around then. It's not a rewarding experience, nor is it emotionally involving. There's a peculiar flippancy to the proceedings, with some scenes which just stop with no resolution, like they were cut off early. Hammer and Chalamet are good but not remarkable, and their romance never comes alive because their characters never do. The director often seems more interested in capturing beautiful nature scenes than forming the character arcs, like he's obtaining footage for Natural World, or he's a landscape scout for the next Terrence Malick picture. As a gay love story, it lacks the fraught emotionality of Brokeback Mountain or the raw passion of Blue Is The Warmest Colour. And as a simple romance, it's leads are too bland and the writing too unfocused to make us care. There's plenty of cinematic love stories which are sweeter, more earnest and much more involving. Call Me By Your Name is just dull.",

Armie Hammer's Oliver appears to float through this world seemingly devoid of self-consciousness. He is not so much a person as a manifestation of some James Ivory fever dream or fantasy. In this coming of age tale, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet's lead character of Elio is played in a very modern naturalistic style. This plus the languid direction leaves the film with a few ticks and quirks. Character behaviors change radically without compensating dialogue. In short, after 15 minutes of people simply entering, staring around and exiting spaces, I lose track of what they are thinking. Given the roiling emotional undercurrents taking place as time passes by in the Italian villa location, the winner of a performance is that of Michael Stuhlbarg as the coolest dad ever.  If you want a more mature romance in an Italian summer go find Katherine Hepburn's Summertime.  I am sure that there must be better gay coming of age movies. This one doesn't have the punch of a Brokeback Mountain. After all of the film circuit buzz, I wanted to be emotionally wrecked by this one, but ultimately I wasn't. [SPOILER] I'll give it this. It is the best Italian summertime movie in which a boy bangs a hot girl, Armie Hammer and a nectarine.  This one is seriously artsy.",

The movie is adorned with picturesque images, sounds, and sensibilities throughout to illustrate this almost dream-like experience. It is set in Italy and plentifully showcases lush landscapes and exemplary architecture to highlight examples of artistic beauty that are both natural and artificial. Its soundtrack is comprised solely of piano compositions to compliment the elegant yet simplistic essence of the film. The \"love as art\" perspective is also conveyed here through language with the dialogue seamlessly transitioning between English and Italian and even featuring some German and French as well. Furthermore, the \"ageless antiquity,\" as phrased in the film, of the statuesque sculptures of the human bodily form, particularly the male in this case, is treated as a motif here, possibly to metaphorically embody the undying inspiration, beauty, and bountiful mystique inherent in the enticing nature of a first love. If critics have forged any complaint for the film, it is regarding the avoidance of real-world consequences in that the romance depicted here is only ever confined to its own little bubble. While this is true, is that really so unlike love, especially a first love? Is it really such a bad thing? There are realistic consequences here; however, they are not external -- the film is not about external, larger real-world consequences. The film is about internal, smaller real-life consequences. The film addresses love found and lost not by the forces and/or wills of the people around it but rather by the two people in it, and truly a poetic union of art and rapture it is. This film, like a wondrous sculpture or painting, is a work of art, beautifully honed by its visionaries and prone to speculation, interpretation, and admiration by anyone who discovers it.",

            "content": "CALL ME BY YOUR NAME\na hauntingly gorgeous love story \n\nBased on the book 2007 book, Call Me By Your Name is a 2017 Romance Drama directed by Luca Guadagnino, starring Timothee Chalamet, Armie Hammer, and Michael Stuhlbarg.  The setting is a crisp, dry summer in 1983 on a sweepingly magnificent Italian villa.  Elio's father is an esteemed Professor who invites one young American student to stay at their villa each Summer, where they immerse themselves in Greco-Roman studies.  When Armie Hammer's Oliver arrives on the scene, a passion is sparked in young Elio, who is sophisticated and brooding, but clearly still an awkward young teen just beginning to explore manhood.  A love blossoms between Elio and Oliver that is unexpected, fleeting, despondent, visceral, and human. \n\nLike the protaganist Elio (expertly played by young rising star Timothee Chalamet), director Luca Guadagnino crafts this film with those same somber, brooding, and melodramatic tonalities.  Call Me By Your Name does not rush to its conclusions but rather tip toes there to keep you perfectly engaged while never quite satiated.  The characters are given enough time to flush out all of their perfections and imperfections, that by the time we finally see the romance coming to a head, we feel as though it is truly earned.   Many other films could not pull off the long, slow, quiet burn of Call Me By Your Name, but Guadagnino is clearly a master of his craft. \n\nThe aesthetic feels humid even to watch.  Somehow Guadagnino and company managed to capture the exact feeling of Italy in the summer and place it on the screen to behold.  Shot entirely on 35mm, this film feels like one you may find hanging around a parents old collection of VHS.  Unassuming and poignant, it would be near impossible to tell this film is coming out in the same year as Transformers The Dark Knight or Wonder Woman, and that works to it's advantage.  Here we have a two hour experience in real life that feels so wholesomely refreshing but risky and chaotic all at once.  We are taken on such a roller coaster of emotion and entirely swept away into the film that you almost forget there isn't a flicker of CGI or camera trickery at play here.  When film is stripped away of all fluff, it becomes increasingly difficult to make it perfect.  Guadagnino stomps on that notion and exceeds the bar.  \nSufjan Stevens provides a haunting backdrop to the shots that is sparse and meticulous.  The music is hardly there and most of the time we watch in silence.  It feels most brilliant at it's quietest moments.  Elio spends a lot of time studying and transcribing piano sheet music and thusly we are generously gifted gorgeous classical compositions whenever he sits at his piano.  Sufjan manages to play off of the classical elements and created one of the most excellent soundtracks of the year.  \n\nCall Me By Your Name is not a big loud movie.  Call Me By Your Name may not be easily digestible for many.  But, Call Me By Your Name, in every sense of film making, is damn near perfection.  Never before have I felt so swept away in a love story as this one.  Luca gave this picture everything it needs to grasp your heart and hold you at it's will until the final credit scene that will keep you glued to your seat.  The star, Timothee Chalamet, is young and new, but already earning nominations for Best Actor for his role as Elio.  Armie Hammer is belieavable and endearing as the older Oliver, and Michael Stuhlbarg steals the show, just before it ends, with one of the most incredibly beautiful monologues in film to date.  \n\nThe spacious, sparse, and instantly classic Call Me By Your Name is earning a 9/10 from me and is clearly one of the top 2 best films of 2017 in my book, directly next to The Shape of Water.  If you have not yet experienced it, seek it out as it gains wider and wider releases.  You won't want to miss this one.",

Beautiful cinematography of Italian landscapes, natural scenery, and open spaces offset the hidden feelings between Elio (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) and Oliver (Armie Hammer) in a touching depiction of homosexual lovers. These characters feel so real. James Ivory's dialogue is packed with verisimilitude and a believable take on how people actually talk.\n\nThe film takes you on a emotional roller coaster during an Italian Summer. Elio and Oliver get to know one another and have split feelings and a coming together. You get to see the subtle visual and verbal cues they send to one another. Call Me by Your Name is leaves you with a numbing sensation of understanding. You empathize with these two men. You feel their pain.\n\nThe acting is so very subtle. You are constantly wondering what Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is thinking and feeling. By the end, you will cry. He is passionate, yet uncertain. You can tell Elio is thoughtful by Chalamet's face and movement. He is always thinking about how people feel about him. This feels so very much like how young people feel about themselves and find faults in their own personality that others do not see. It's a true to life portrayal and Chalamet performs with thoughtful choices every frame. He deserved the Oscar nomination. The bravery and detail with which Chalamet acts is breathtaking and will leave you moved.\n\nThe excellent and focused direction of Luca Guadagnino is evident with every frame. His shots are well paced, focused, and leave you with space to take in the surroundings. He lets you see people's faces and body language, while giving the environmental context for their world. His establishing shots show the whole Italian estate for the lush setting. Green nature envelops the characters in this world open to feeling. Guadagnino is a very talented director who makes sure you feel like you are following Chalamet everywhere to build your emotional attachment to his character.\n\nOverall, Call Me by Your Name is a lovingly tale of uncertain feelings and forbidden love. It's well shot, carefully written, beautifully scored by Sufjan Stevens, perfectly cast, and so affectionately acted by the entire cast. I cannot recommend this film enough. See Call Me by Your Name immediately for a heartfelt love story as well as a stunning resonance of empathy.",

Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is fantastic as Elio, and his chemistry with Armee Hammer is genuine and lovely. Although their relationship is at the heart of the movie, the love of family and friends is just as important. The monolgue of Mr Perlman is heartwrenching and beautiful, and everyone should be so lucky as Elio to have his parents' unconditional love. This is a quiet movie that lets the summer roll along sweetly as well as the romance. It is, to me, one of the most romantic movies I've ever seen. The charming sophistication of Elio wrapped up in a sweet awakening of his love for Oliver is a thing of beauty. I will have to read the book upon which the book is based. Loved.",

            "content": "Call Me By Your Name is a simply beautiful exploration of love. It is a deep emotional journey that left a major impression on me. Set in Northern Italy in the summer of 1983 this film explores the relationship between the young son of a educated couple and the older man who comes to stay with them. It's a slow burning film that takes its time in glorious fashion, revealing little layers through out the film that all add up to a subtle intelligent deeply felt film about love and desire. The film radiates passion and intelligence with high quality performances and many touching moments. It's a languid film that stops to revel in the smaller details of life. Special mention should go to the young actor Timothee Chalamet who delivers a performance of great range as the young man discovering his sexuality. It's a tender and trusting film that also pays attention to the questions of coming out and feeling natural in your own skin. I should also the mention the monologue delivered by Michael Stuhlbarg, a scene I would love to have bottled. This is a special film that ably displays the full gamut of human emotion.",

The two lead actors had amazing performances and that is the biggest take away for me. I especially loved Arnie Hammer's performance. The speech that Elio's father gives at the end of the film is what makes the movie for me. It captured the beauty of the leads relationship and sums up the point of the movie.",

            "content": "Back in 2016, Moonlight, an LGBT film, was released and later crowned best picture at the Academy Awards and now 2017 follows this up with a strong Oscar contender in the form of Call Me By Your Name, a very different LGBT film with a unique coming-of-age story to tell. The film is directed by acclaimed Italian director Luca Guadagnino, set in 1980's Italy it follows 17 year-old Elio (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) who bonds with his fathers new American research assistant Oliver (Armie Hammer) and begins to explore his sexuality in a relationship that will change their lives forever. This romantic drama is in every sense of the word a beautiful and powerfully emotional story that capitalises on strong meaningful performances and charming dialogue to explore a wholly engaging relationship.\n\nVisually this movie is undeniable exquisite as the way it is shot allows you to take in all of the stunning scenery of the rich Italian setting and it essentially transports you to Northern Italy. The use of natural lighting and calming indoor and outdoor settings around the Italian villa that the majority of scenes take place in is phenomenal. The set design can only be described as utterly beautiful, it's a very inviting and relaxing setting that works wonders in bringing you into this world and this home that is quite foreign yet at the same time very familiar. The heavy use of foreign languages such as Italian and French between the main cast adds to the authenticity of the setting. English is used when the story calls for it and it's used very naturally in conversation. The score and sound design is another fantastically executed part of the film, a number of scenes are accompanied by a light piano-based score which sets the tone of every scene it is featured in poignantly. Other scenes that don't utilise a score are filled with the sounds of the surrounding environment and most of the time, that's all it needs. \n\nPerformance-wise the two leads in Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Armie Hammer are spectacular from beginning to end. Chalamet puts in an emotionally riveting performance that grabs you and takes you on this coming-of-age journey of self-exploration. It's an Oscar-worthy performance that will at the very least be recognised throughout the 2018 award season. Hammer completely disappears into his role and offers up a sense of this confidence-rich charisma that makes his character unique and very entertaining to watch. His relationship with Chalamet is essential in this entire film working as intended and it plays out greatly. The film is shrouded with incredible, meaningful dialogue from beginning to end and just when you think it has nothing left to offer it hits hard in the closing moments. There is a certain monologue in the final moments from one character that brings everything full circle and will probably emotionally ruin you. It focuses on themes of love and acceptance and it's my personal highlight of the entire film. \n\nSo in the end, the only minor gripe I had with the film is that the first half or maybe the first act at times felt a tad lengthy as the whole movie is a slow build. But what it takes time building in these earlier moments makes the later sequences that much better. I've said it before and I'll say it again, this movie is beautiful in its story, its setting, its score, it's a very emotionally driven film and it's a strong best picture contender at the Academy Awards. \n\n8.5/10",

To be perfectly honest, I probably would have paid for a ticket just to see handsome newcomer Timothee Chalamet (Elio) in the role of a sexually adventurous young man, nearly naked in several scenes. After seeing the movie, that allure turns out to be just about the only redeeming feature in an otherwise hollow and artificial waste of time.\n\n\"Call Me By Your Name\" suffers from numerous fatal flaws: The main characters lack any believable \"chemistry\". Armie Hammer (Oliver) is a horrible actor with as much sex appeal as a cardboard cutout. There is absolutely no effort to explain the attraction Elio has for aloof Oliver and visa versa - it seems to come from nowhere and for no reason. There are hints that each of the two main characters has depth and talent - intellectual Oliver and musical prodigy Elio - but those scenes seem out of place and contrived with no payoff in the plot. The weird request from which the movie gets it's title is spoken in a scene, but there is no explanation for it. It comes from nowhere and goes nowhere. I haven't read the book, but the screenplay lacks any kind of conflict, which makes it BORING.\n\nThe highlights are the beautiful Italian locations and Timothee Chalamet. I wouldn't bother to see it for any other reason.",

            "content": "Every year there are a few movies that feel special. They resonate and grab every emotion in you for their two hour run time and the days that follow as you think back to the characters and story you just took in. Call Me By Your Name is one of those making it one of the very best movies of 2017. For Elio (Chalamet), every summer entails going off to Northern Italy to his family estate. It's 1983 so it's a summer where you can truly get away in those days long before you were distracted by social media and a constant connection to the real world. He can lay by their pool, read a plethora of books, or go dancing with his friends. It's this summer for Elio that will be the most eye-opening. Also spending the summer in Italy is Armie Hammer's Oliver, a young, gorgeous doctorate student who happens to be the research assistant to Elio's father (Stuhlbarg). There's something about this new Adonis figure that catches the eye of Elio. It may be Oliver's astute knowledge of architecture and music or those sharp physical features. Elio is enticed, but unsure what these feelings are.\n\nIt's worth a reminder that this is Italy 1983, a time when it wasn't socially acceptable to be out and open with your sexuality. LGBT labels weren't easily attached to the feelings you were attributing toward someone. As the summer progresses, the women in the village fawn over Oliver all hoping to have their time with him. The sexual tension between he and Oliver cannot be ignored for too long with Elio openly expressing his feelings to Oliver. It's a love affair kept in secret as they navigate uncharted territories within themselves in the limited time they have together as the summer starts to wind down.\n\nWriter James Ivory is a bit of an icon in gay cinema with the Merchant Ivory films like Maurice, The Remains of the Day, and A Room with a View. At the age of 90, he shows no sign of retirement basing his script on the novel by Andr\u00e9 Aciman. There's a dreamlike fantasy to this story of Elio's summer of love. For some, it's that summer away from your normal environment that allows for a freer and a welcome atmosphere for your sexuality to arouse in a different way than before. Let alone if it happens against an Italian backdrop that oozes with romanticism. The sensuality of falling for someone is perfectly captured by Sayombhu Mukdeeprom's cinematography as the camera knows how to flirt with both actors. The sexual tension and heat between Armie Hammer and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet exudes off the screen in a way I rarely see from an onscreen couple. Part of that is the open trust the actors have with how director Luca Guadagnino (A Bigger Splash) showcases their bodies in the glistening summer heat.\n\nWe, the viewers, understand what's happening between both characters and naturally want them to passionately hook up faster than the film allows. Part of the tension is that back and forth tug of war both Elio and Oliver have with their sexuality and the undetermined acknowledgment if their feelings are mutual. We see Elio trying to fight it given the societal pressures and lack of acceptance he may face with family and friends in 1983. He attempts to date a girl as a way to appease his parents and uses her to test the waters with Oliver. The scenes are awkward, yet realistic for someone in Elio's transition.\n\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet (Lady Bird) is a huge star on the rise. He's magnetic on screen and you can't help but fall for him and understand every struggle his character goes through. It's the kind of performance that isn't showy or over-the-top, but one that needs constant adjustments. Elio lives and alters his outward persona on a daily basis depending on his surroundings, how open he wants to be to Oliver, and how truthful he wants to be with himself. Chalamet plays every note of Elio's to perfection. It's the kind of performance that can't be done alone as so much of it rides on his chemistry with Armie Hammer. As Oliver, Hammer gives the best performance of his career since his breakout role in The Social Network. Hammer nails that outward confidence of Oliver's that makes that character so rich and tantalizing. He's never cocky or arrogant, but uses it to allure Elio at every turn. The story isn't just about Elio and Oliver, but the role Elio's father plays in this. He's played by Michael Stuhlbarg, who also appears in The Shape of Water and The Post, and will make you weep in one of the film's final moments. Saying any more would ruin his monologue.\n\nCall Me By Your Name demonstrates that time is always present when it comes to how we deal with our sexuality. It's about that precise time when you start noticing that shift in your sexuality. Someone comes into your life and forces you to deal with something that has lain dormant until now. Much like Elio, you don't quite know if it's affection or attraction or both. You then have to determine if that is the right time to give in to these feelings or brush them aside. Sometimes you don't know that is was the right time until it's too late as demonstrated with another character. Luca Guadagnino never rushes a beat in his direction of his actors. It may seem like the movie moves at a slower pace, but their story isn't one that can be rushed at the beginning. The conflict rises knowing that the summer must come to an end. There are awkward, nervous ticks and subtle moments that crescendo into a smooth and graceful sexual encounter.\n\nIf you were moved by movies like Brokeback Mountain, Moonlight, and Carol, you will experience the same love and loss that comes with Call Me By Your Name. The score is reminiscent of some of Stephen Sondheim's more moving piano works with some new Sufjan Stevens songs written for the film. It's easy to get swept up in Elio and Oliver's budding relationship as you can instantly feel yourself basking in that Italian getaway. It never plays it too safe including one particularly bizarre, yet memorable scene with Elio. By the end, it will hit you like a ton of bricks and sit with you for days.\n\nIs It Worth Your Trip to the Movies? Put this at the top of your list. It's not to be missed in theaters.\n\nRATING: 5 out of 5 TICKET STUBS",

The summer story is told at an achingly belabored slow pace.  All the angst of the summer doesn't have an ending until it is tied up in a ribbon in a late scene speech by the boy's father.

            "content": "The adjective you're searching for is \"tender.\" From the first series of title cards through to every instagrammable frame of Luca Guadagnino's Call Me By Your Name it is the tenderness that remains pungent to each of the senses. While it may not always feel or seem as if there is a particular tenderness to the love story being told here-the film takes its sweet time introducing this inevitable aspect-there is always a tenderness to each of the characters as they exist in this bubble of eternal warmth brought on by the summer season and their escape to Northern Italy. Tenderness breathes through every ounce of Guadagnino's film whether he is highlighting the see-through indigo waters of the Ligurian Sea or the intimate brush of soft skin between two human beings. This consistently gentle, but still strikingly beautiful aesthetic paired with the large amounts of sympathy we, the viewers, continue to feel as we grow more and more involved in the story paints this overall portrait of seventeen year-old Elio (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) and his budding relationship with the visiting Oliver (Armie Hammer) in gentle motions of complete tenderness. Suffice to say, Call Me By Your Name is not simply a film about the coming of age of a young, gay male in the early eighties, but it is a complex character analysis of this young man who has been given every academic advantage, but still struggles to figure out who he is among his liberal Jewish family that has refined his cultured and delicate personality. Elio is a personality that is wholly understanding and forthright about the circumstances that have led to his upbringing and how such has shaped the person he presently is, but this level of perspective has also brought about a level of self-awareness that allows Elio to understand how little he understands about the more vital, emotional aspects of being. Though I've yet to see Guadagnino's 2009 breakout hit I Am Love I wasn't all too impressed with last year's A Bigger Splash as it was more a melodrama where the characters had nothing better to do than create their own drama while yearning to be of huge emotional resonance, but ultimately failing to do so because those characters brought so much of their strife upon themselves. With his latest, Guadagnino adapts Andr\u00e9 Aciman's novel from James Ivory's screenplay and transcends the intellectual bubble of privilege and emotional consumption by submitting itself entirely to the tender love story that is its essence.\n\nread the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com",

I had so many emotion in this crafty film, i was disappointed, but satisfy all at the same time. The struggle of the lgbt in the 80's in italy was surreal. Luca Guadaguino captured this love story with a fantastic 80's atmosphere that was done really great, seeing a bit of italy landscape was fanastic. The performance by all our cast was very memorable and excellent; especially the performance by Armie Hammer, and Timothee Chalamet. They both did an extraordinary performance. The score was beautifully fun, and a lot of heart. This drama film was full of emotions and a love story that just had me glued to the film.

It's 1983 and 17 year old Elio (Timothee Chalamet) is living an idyllic life in the northern Italian countryside when Oliver (Armie Hammer) arrives to be an assistant to Elio's father (Michael Stuhlbarg). Elio almost immediately becomes infatuated with the 30 year old and after a while  the two enter into an awkward, secret, steamy relationship.  Timothee Chalamet and Armie Hammer are electric both when alone and sharing the screen. Michael Stuhlbarg shines as well and gets a great speech near the end of the film.  I especially liked the character of Elio, who is a cool intellectual nerd (who also is a very good dancer). Luca Guadagnino expertly and beautifully directs.  The film is also VERY sexual at times (even uncomfortably so, like the apricot masturbation scene.The camera also lingers on the male body. No male nudity here except for one butt shot, we do get one quick shot of female breasts as well). My only real complaint is that the film glorifies the relationship near the end, and I couldn't fully go there with it. Call Me By Your Name made me feel a wide range of emotions, and got me thinking about certain experiences in my life I didn't necessarily want to be reminded of (But I guess that's the sign of a good film). It's ultimately the story of a boy's first real love and lost love. It's a bitter-sweet, truthful, melancholy, and beautiful movie and ranks as one of the best of 2017. Not for everyone, but I personally loved it.",

            "content": "\"Call Me By Your Name\" was not as well-received and thrilling to me as it was for most. I had high hopes for the film but I was left pondering what could have been? What was left un-said?! Although beautifully crafted and filmed, I felt the film lacked honesty. It was not overtly true to it's time (the eighties, AID's epidemic, hate/fear propaganda, etc.), age difference (Oliver's fear/hesitation of being labeled as a pedophile was mostly absent, immaturity, etc.), the term \"gay\" or \"homosexual\" was never used but heavily implied.  Oliver, who was an American scholar and socially conditioned to perceive the age of seventeen as being a pre-mature did not show enough pull and restraint from his urges. Although the legal consent within Italy is sixteen, one would think the fears of judgement would be more dormant in a American born citizen. Even from Elio who was part American as well.  Although the characters were purposely directed to be vague, leading to one's imagination, I felt frustrated due to the lack of frankness. The language felt quite pompous and pretentious and not \"human\". Although it was simplistic enough to follow along to, one was left feeling bamboozled by the \"heavy icing\" of it all. The cinematography and composition was stellar to be fair. Beautifully orchestrated yet contrived in originality. But one was quickly taken out of a trance from the elephant in the room. The film was built in this crafted utopia in Italy and drowned in poetic/symbolic language that failed to hit a home run. A movie boasted to be built around the essence of authenticity and yet failed to acknowledge the matter at hand directly. It was one of those films that added nothing new to society/culture (no sense of social enlightenment) and romanticized a fantasy i.e. novella. For me the female characters were more complexed and interesting. The teen's female companion said something that stuck with me, \"I'm afraid you are going to hurt me!\" In which he eventually did. And she took the higher road and asked for friendship. Interesting to contextualize for a second. Or his mother?! Do you think she knew about her husband and her son?! I believe so. My biggest issue with the film was the director's treatment of the specific genders. One thing I admired, was in a age of raw, sexual exploitation (the ideology that the more we see is best), Oliver and Elio love scenes were treated with class and handled in way to allow for true sensual moment's/intimacy (much was not exposed, etc. ). BUT the women on the other hand was not given this similar treatment. Elio's female companion was exposed from the neck down and her love scene seemed abrasive, as depicted to be a mere pawn. Maybe the director wanted to show her as such since Elio's character used her as a beacon of escape?! All in all,  I'm sure the novel, which is well praised, may have been the best avenue for this zealous concept. In the end, the cast was strong, although I felt that the casting could have been better for Oliver, due to the thirty year old actor (Armie Hammer) playing a 24 y.o. Externally not believable but Armie did add a lot of charm and substance to his role/film. I did see a lot of breakout performances from this cast (stand out's like Timoth\u00e9e and Amira), but this is not a film I think one would use to educate and inspire LBTQ acceptance and diversity like Barry Jenkins, Moonlight. I left feeling that the film was meant to be a \"Oscar baited\" entrapment and neglected the true significance of human connection within social confinement's. I'm sure the film will score many awards but will it stand the test of time, we shall see?!",

People outside New York or Paris or the like just weren\u2019t ready for out-in-the-open gay relationships. Oliver\u2019s ultimate decisions were typical for the time but I like to thing they might come together again 10 years later. I know, but I long for films with gay leads who aren\u2019t in drag, or end up alone, or are period dramas about HIV (which thank God this wasn\u2019t). We need more films like this one, which explore love as love even when it\u2019s between men. As a hopeless romantic I\u2019d love to see a remake of something like Notting Hill or Love Actually as a gay love story with a happy ending as there are so few (see \u201cShelter\u201d). But Call Me By Your Name, even with the imperfect casting of Armie Hammer, hits all the right notes and is probably the best film of 2017.

He's tear brought me in tears; his bitter smile brought me to smile; and the last gaze to the camera (to the audience) has made my heart skipped a beat. Timoth\u00e9e's performance in this movie deserves to be ranked among the top performance of the year. Lastly, Michael Stuhlbarg's final monologue has brought me (and the rest of the audience) to the emotional climax.

I experienced what I often experience when I watch a movie based on a book I've read, which is the movie seems like a superficial CliffsNotes version of the story. Call Me By Your Name is a book that actually doesn't lend itself well to a film because so much of the story takes place in Elio's thoughts. The film does hit most of the key events in the book, but doesn't connect them up well because we're not privy to Elio's thoughts about what's happening and why they are happening, as we are in the book. Scenes happen in the film because they happened in the book even though they don't necessarily flow organically from what's been shown so far. The chief example of this is the central romance between Elio and Oliver. It begins at a certain point in the story because that's when it begins in the book, but there really hasn't been enough groundwork laid for it, especially with Oliver. The film does very little to show that Oliver has been falling for Elio and so it feels a bit random when we see how into Elio he is. This also prevents the romance from taking on the deep, love of a lifetime aspect it is supposed to have. I never got the impression that the characters were experiencing anything deeper than a typical summer fling. And so I'm not that impressed with James Ivory's screenplay. He stayed very loyal to the book, which is not a good thing for a film when the book is as introspective as CMBYN.\n\nThe film is well cast and well acted, but the editing struck me as a bit rough. I was left with the impression that the editing had been rushed to completion to meet a deadline. The whole effort feels undercooked to me. \n\nIt's not a bad film by any means. In the end, I think it will be remembered for the shades of gray it presents in human sexuality and also for introducing us to Timothee Chalamet, who is a wonderful actor destined for stardom.",

It's really just another Gay coming of age story that has been told much more effectively in the past.  Yes the cinematography is stunning and the actors are attractive, but no more so than any other film of this trite genre.    \n\nMoreover, this adaptation does not fly for many reasons beginning with the  lack of chemistry between the two main characters.  The romance is not plausible.   But the story is also absent of genuine anguish and pain.  Perhaps if Elio's parents were non accepting  and he was forced to deal with the loss of Oliver and his family concomitantly would there be any depth to this fluffy film.  The dialogue is also inane, and the lack of 80's songs (minus one) is inane.  \n\nOverall, Call Me By Your Name is not a credible film.  Beautiful to look at, but hollow at its core.  It's a shame superior Gay coming of age films were  marginalized, because they were produced in an era when homophobia was the social norm.  This movie tries hard to have a foreign artsy feel, but in the end no one feels anything, especially the audience.",

It transports you to a time and place and fills in every last sumptuous detail. But ironic that a country notoriously slow in acceptance of LGBT lifestyles serves as the setting of the latest iconic gay love story. Good. I wish I could say I found the central romance as engaging. Would we feel equally enthralled by the glacial pacing if it was a hetero affair? Armie Hammer is wonderful but perhaps miscast nonetheless. Having never been called a prude in my life, I'm baffled as to why I seem to be the only critic that felt a bit uncomfortable about the age difference between romantic partners. Timothee Chalamet looks every bit the teenager (he's playing a 17-year old) and Armie Hammer looks like a dude in his thirties, although he's supposedly playing a grad student (age not mentioned). Would all be mum if a young girl was having her heart broken by a man that looked the age of her uncle? That peccadillo aside it is thrilling to see the envelope of gay intimacy pushed further into the mainstream. The acting is top-notch. The writing crisp, and natural. It's a fully immersive experience. Viva L'Italia!",

Butterflies in stomach, longing for touch, nonstop erotic thoughts, newfound excitement in old rooms and places, the type of day-old memories that keep playing out in front of your eyes like a film. Call Me By Your Name is a sensual movie in the least pretentious meaning of the word - a love story told through touch, smells, taste and warm feelings. And eventually tears.\n\nArmie Hammer and Timothee Chalamet have such a great chemistry. They both also bring really rich subtle movements that help enrich who their characters are without words. Elio's stiff shoulders and repetitive smooth slides into rooms, his talent on the piano the sleeping beast within. Oliver's imposing stature and brain, juxtaposed with his soft touches and open movements. I also adored Michael Stuhlbarg - like can we give this guy an oscar already he is always fucking fantastic. But he really steals the show in his final monologue, in a scene that splashes you in the face not only because it makes you realize how long it's been since there was some actual thoughtful and reflective dialogue in the movie but also with its overwhelmingly kind and understanding content.\n\nIt's a beautiful movie too, heavy on the out of focus sun-saturated scenes. It captures Italy in the summer for sure, flies and all. Also an excellent soundtrack, a mix of classically arranged music with 80s Italian pop and then modern day Sufjan. Though the movie starts a little too slowly and a little too stilted. The scene of Elio and Oliver standing around the WWI monument felt like it came out of nowhere - I needed more furtive glances and notes of longing before they could have dialogue that was that overt. But while the transition felt awkward, everything that follows lapses into a truly natural and physical romance.",

            "content": "This movie gave me some mixed signals. Tell me if you think this is socially acceptable: an American grad student, 24, flies out to Northern Italy to spend a summer in residence with his research professor's family, during which time he is the catalyst for the 17 year old daughter's sexual awakening. I know, it happens all the time in the midwest (though normally this dynamic plays out more often in the trailer park), and out here it is kind of wink-wink pedophilia, but depending on a whole gamut of parameters (socioeconomic status mainly) it isn't really talked about or flagged as an issue. Well, that's the premise of this film except it's the son instead of the daughter. So, in light of Kevin Spacey, the character's age, the fact that Italy's age of consent is 14, and the bisexual/gay context, I'm unsure how to approach this film. I know that people younger than 23 haven't had the convenience of their frontal lobe fully developing, and that makes for complicated, dramatic relationships. If I hadn't seen Luca Guadagnino's previous film A Bigger Splash, I would have given him the benefit of the doubt - that he's genuinely interested in exploring the sting of first romance in the context of comparing European and American societies' perspectives on homosexuality. But there is a 17 year old girl in A Bigger Splash used as an implement of sexual desire for an older man, so it seems like these \"kids\" are being used as cheap transgressive thrills. I know Guadagnino isn't a writer/auteur, but he clearly intended these two movies and 2009's I am Love as his \"Desire Trilogy\", and I can't help but glare at them like Chris Hansen. Pushing those issues aside, the film is care-free and never falls victim to the \"gay tragedy\" trope. In fact, there's a quiet, if not a little hedonistic pride in being whatever and loving whatever you want, which I can certainly appreciate. Michael Stuhlbarg delivers a very touching monologue near the end that seems to encapsulate the tribulations of learning who you are and how the world works, yet never letting it tell you who you must be. It's a summer movie, bright and subtle, full of swimming and new wave music and Sufjan Stevens - not really my bag, but I can see why it's getting praise in the cinephile circles.",

Haven't read the book - from what I've heard of it, it sounds like they did a good job adapting it. It was refreshing and lovely to see a movie solely about the connection between the two characters without a battle against disapproving parents or peers. Well, almost solely about that... along with objectification and belittling of women (lol). \nThe chemistry between Elio and Oliver post-kiss was very genuine and sweet, but i was just ultimately pretty unmoved.

Not a big fan of Ivory selections of adaptations due to their generally simplistic themes and exploitation of a subculture conversely struggling to maintain credibility in the art world, but this one was obvious in its formula to ensnare the innocent and offer no apology. The screenplay and direction had absolutely no levity the book had, the characters had no chemistry whatsoever (and that IS the whole story in the book), both actors I found couldn't grasp the style, expression or introspection, of their charactors.. offering silly timefilling performancing and not allowing the viewer any feeling of growth within the evolution of their relationship. The words as written in the script were so implausible that I was distracted by the crest of social correctedness they thought they could coast on (upping the ante on gay love acceptance by suggesting its just as acceptable if the initiator is just 17..cuz this love is just SO real..SO relevant).  It was made obvious that all but the 2 lead actors were just background players and were ridiculous foils to their every line, either \"enhancing\" intrigue by suggesting \" 'Somethings up' \" or offering conistantly implausible (for the characters of parents and female hetero love interest freshly deflowered by unrequited interest) support.  This screenplay had the sophistication and sincerity of a play written by a highschooler - or a submission to Penthouses fictional love stories. As superficial was the content of this film so are the raving reviews never speaking of the natural evolution of the affair - lack thereof.  A middle-aged lady leaving the theater along side me summed it up perfectly for me when she announced to no one in particular in Armie style indifference believing, im sure, that she was sounding sincere, \"That was beautiful.\"  The triumph of this cinematic journey was that it found its audience.  I think if a viewer wants the exercise realizing in an alternate world that love/infatuation can win over social morals (using the same conflicts) then the movie For a Lost Soldier is 3 times the risk and at least 3 times the achievement of this American funded production.",

The actors were absolutely amazing! There's a monologue delivered by Elio's father that really redefines a modern ideal of fatherhood (and had literally everyone in the audience tearing up).

            "content": "Have you ever seen a movie that you liked but then once you see the ending you really really liked the movie?  Well, that was Call Me By Your Name for me.  What is undoubtedly a good movie for 115 minutes, becomes a great one after the full 132 minutes.  Luca Guadagnino directs this film in such a calming but yet provocative manner.  When the film needs to heat up, it does, and when it needs to slow down and provide a more methodical and thoughtful approach to romance, it most certainly does that as well.\n\nI guess with every big film there's always a section of the audience that comes out with serious backlash to some sort of aspect to the story.  With Call Me By Your Name, it was that the romance between a 24-year old male (Oliver, played by Armie Hammer) and a 17-year old male (Ellio, played by Timothee Chalamet) is unethical and highly controversial.  While I can't speak for how that particular group of people felt watching the film, I can tell you that I never once felt like this was a relationship that wasn't consensual.  In fact, it's not even so much that it was definitely portrayed as consensual by the two males (and the parents of the younger male for that matter), but it's that the film never makes an outright statement saying that a relationship with this age gap is \"right\".  It's a fictional story with fictional people.  No one is telling you this relationship is right or glorifying what is considered to be a forbidden relationship.\n\nPersonally, I took it more as a young male figuring out love for the first time and the person who helps him discover that love is an older (albeit only 7 years) male with more experience.  I won't tell anyone who feels differently that they are wrong, that's simply the way I saw the story play out.  And if I'm being honest, I thought the relationship between Ellio and Oliver was beautifully told and portrayed.  Chalamet is magnetic and relatable (no matter what your sexual preference is) and Hammer nicely balanced the \"hard to get\" and effortlessly desirable part of the romance.  I'm a straight man in my mid-20's but I found there to be things very relatable in both of their characters.\n\nThe film also does a good job of presenting a world that feels foreign but also approachable.  Taking place in Italy and in 1983, Call Me By Your Name is great escapist cinema, while also being something timeless in storytelling.  Something only few films can capture, a few being Richard Linklater's Before Trilogy, which was clearly an inspiration.  My only gripe would probably be the pacing, which is purposefully slower in nature.  For me, I just would have liked something that gets to the punch a little quicker.  Speaking of \"the punch\", the clear winner of this picture is Michael Stuhlbarg's ending speech about love to Ellio.  I never thought a short monologue from one man to another could be so powerfully poignant, but that was this speech.\n\n8.6/10",

Armie Hammer is OK, particularly for a character who obviously has not resolved his own conflicts about his sexuality.  The seduction dance they they mutually perform with each other was well done, with neither wanting to  face rejection and humiliation.  Oliver was not a particularly likable character because he seemed to need to stay in control of the relationship. He knew he had more power over a teen who was experiencing his first love, and he didn't fail to take advantage of it.  The most disappointing part of the movie was the ending which seemed a bit flat and predictable.  One of the surprising delights was the credits.  During the credits, you see the face of Elio staring into the fireplace and going through a series of emotions as he realizes the relationship is not to be.

I'm not a fan of basic romantic movies so I didn't have high hopes that I would like this movie. Towards the end is where I figured I was wrong. Of course it's not like any other romantic movie! Two men in love comes with much more obstacles and a greater chance of heartbreak; especially in 1983. I realized towards the end of the movie why this film beat around the bush so much. If there was the classical dramatic scenes, where people are screaming, sobbing and becoming frustrated; this movie would have actually been clich\u00e9. Call Me By Your Name is a super-realism film. Things you expect, and want to happen don't; just like reality. However, being that this movie is unlike most; it's hard to follow a story that doesn't have much conflict.

            "content": "Not to be a contrarian, but Call Me By Your Name is a marvelous performance by Timothee Chalamet, trapped in a mediocre literary adaptation of a great novel, by a great director who keeps firing blanks and a screen writer, who should have known better than remove the most important message of the source material. Let me explain. Chalamet is simply mesmerizing - when he is on screen, the movie sparkles with incredible authenticity. The same cannot be said about Armie Hammer - he is largely wooden and uncomfortable, with an expressed ambiguity of a, well, hammer. This is the third movie by Luca Gudagnino in wide release and it simply does not live up to the promise of Io Sono Amore (I Am Love), though it is clearly better than the misguided A Bigger Splash. I am a big fan of erratic geniuses (still waiting for a great masterpiece from Allen and Mallick), but in this instance, the editing, self indulgence and simply terrible music (much of it committed by the otherwise note-worthy Suffjan Stevens) make me think that Luca is loosing the plot. Never mind, it will be a boffo box office, couple of Oscars and all, as it is a (straight) crowd pleaser. The biggest offender, though, is the unassailable James Ivory, whose script makes a curious choice. It cleaves off the most important part of the Andre Aciman's novel - its final coda. In the movie, we are led to believe that the final contact between the lovers was the telephone call from Oliver, announcing his engagement (to a woman). So there you have it: it was just a phase for Oliver and merely a summer infatuation for Ellio. Clean, non-threathening ending for the general population. The novel is much more nuanced. They meet again, some years later. They have kept tabs on each other, if somewhat surreptitiously. But their encounter reveals the true message of the novel: Ellio is a fully realized, if lonely, man. He knows what love is all about. Oliver, on the other hand, is the lost soul. He has a family and a career, but his life is empty, because his heart stopped beating when he chose mainstream respectability over love that (to this day) does not dare to speak its name very loudly... In Ivory's world, Oliver is the conformist Clive to Ellio's brave Maurice from that eponymous Merchant/Ivory outing. It's a shame a great story got sacrificed yet again to the god of Mammon. Regardless, everybody is tripping over themselves in adoring this film, so I don't expect many to pay attention to these issues. Maybe just the thinking ones.",

This story could have been played by a young man and a young girl, a teacher and a student or two older women - it doesn't matter because it is a story about love and can be written on any couple which falls in love for the first time. Sad is the person who hasn't felt the questionings and disappointments of first love in their life and haven't experienced the sort of connection Oliver and Elio share and therefore feel the need to accuse the movie of glorifying pedophilia. This movie is touchable, tastable, smellable and feelable - it speaks to all the senses.

You can tell that the director\u2019s main goal isn\u2019t to tell a gay story just for an Oscar grab, but to tell a story of love in general and question it. The characters aren\u2019t ashamed because their love is uncommon, it\u2019s because they can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s genuine or just fulfilling selfish sexual desires. It\u2019s really refreshing to see interesting characters in a film involving this topic. The cast did a fantastic job.

            "content": "I read the reviews here and wonder about a loss of capacity in reviewers and audiences to experience film art in a detached-yet-engaged way. The components of the story people seem to have wanted to experience were indeed all in place. But a lack of care in the most important part - the human dynamic between the two lead characters, especially early in their relationship - resulted in the film spooling out as a mere wishful fairy tale, a hazy feel-good yarn fogged by a lazy or self-absorbed director and hampered by poor management of the crucial characters. Part of the problem is with Mr. Hammer's casting. He is earnest but simply too old for the role and too limited as an actor working without careful direction to lend the sterling approbation of the audience and the teenager's parents. Chalamet, with greater potential, was encouraged to  play a savvy, brilliant, socially adept youth as rather spastic. The rest of the cast was exemplary, although the smugness behind the inevitably wealthy parents added to a smarmy glow that was not earned. So they came across more as procurers of sexual experience for their son with an experienced older man than understanding humanists. The sets were beautiful; again, fairy-tale beautiful. The towns and countryside appeared to have suffered a pogrom against the resident Italians, because all we ever saw were scattered representatives of the populace placed sparsely for colorful effect. A few additional plot points pecked at the facade of reality. Why did the boy's room have to be given up to the visitor? Why were the young women in the film treated as such set dressing, so available and so naively understanding and gullible? Yes, the film was fine in all the details so carefully arranged, but not in the ones that mattered most. A revolting closeup at the end, played out over long minutes with the credits playing,  ultimately showed who the real users were for this young, confused, bemused character. The writer and director, playing their fantasy out with the cruelty of objectification.",

Elio is just experimenting with emotions, searching and the onset of sexual awakening.  Bisexuality pervades this overly self indulgent, lugubrious art house piece. Michael Stuhlbarg is the all too wise academic who oozes prescience, but this whole endeavor is nothing more than a gay indulgent vanity project.  Hammer's Oliver is far too self satisfied and protests that he doesn't want Elio to do \"anything he doesn't want to do\" but then creates a seduction schematic that persists throughout the film.  This is a film of a novel which caters to a select audience; this is a film that did not need to be made and especially did not need to be fawned over by the leftist Hollywood crowd to which this film is clearly aimed.  Just as with the vastly overrated \"Moonlight\" which won the best picture Oscar out of victim politics more so than artistic merit, this film too is a victory of style (and PC) over substance.",

Set amid the sunny countryside of northern Italy, the film takes it sweet time establishing the lazy world of its characters and their closely intersecting orbits. I became anxious because the characters kept me at arm's length, leaving their burgeoning romance to feel distant and tame. I understand the hesitation of both parties and the age difference complicating matters. I understand caution. But it feels like the film is cautious to a fault, to the point that one of them laments later why they wasted so much time. The acting is pleasant if undistinguished. The best scene is a terrific monologue by Michael Stuhlbarg as the world's most lovably accepting father. For an earth-shattering romance, I too often felt unmoved and restless. If we're going to spend this much time hanging out with these people we should get to know them more intimately, and not just in the physical sense. I missed the compelling artistic charge of something like a Moonlight. I'm a bit stupefied at all the praise heaped upon Call Me By Your Name, a fine indie drama that, for me, too infrequently delves below its pretty surface into something more substantial.\n\nNate's Grade: B-",

Pedophelia refers to an adult's sexual preference for prepubescent children age 13 and younger, which is illegal. \nThis movie depicts an unconventional consensual romantic relationship between two men within the legal albeit young age (17 and 24). \nYale scholar Joseph Fischel:\n\"Our society's intense focus on age and sexuality is a relatively recent notion, not a long-settled one, and that while the law may have a legitimate need to be blunt and rigid, our art does not. In my view, it's reasonable to be disturbed by the unconventional relationship in Call Me by Your Name, but it's not reasonable to say the movie endorses pedophilia, or really any kind of power-based abuse, just because it depicts that relationship. If we go down that censorious and unnuanced path with our art, very little will survive the trip.\"\nChalamet showcases his amazing acting talent in the ending scene; and the dad's monologue is definitely resonating with me.

Oliver is 24.  Elio is 17.  The age of consent in Italy in 1983 was 14.  Today it's 16.  This charge has no merit whatsoever.\n\nThis onslaught of attacks is organized, targeted and designed to discredit the movie, you can be sure.\n\nBut they won't win.  Homophobic bigots can't defeat a genuine work of art that explores and celebrates love.  Love is fragile.  But we who love and defend love when we see it aren't fragile.

            "content": "There is much to admire in this film, especially the breakthrough lead performance by Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet. And northern Italy looks beautiful. But this is a very slow film where very little happens. Although the screenwriter is legendary Merchant Ivory director James Ivory (now nearly 90) and there is a bit of a Merchant Ivory feel to the production, there is none of the magic of \"Remains of the Day,\" \"A Room with a View,\" or \"Howards End\" - all of which were based on rich novels. Too much of the dialogue in \"Call Me by Your Name\" is clunky, a disproportionate amount of it falling to a wooden Armie Hammer. And director Luca Guadagnino seems more interested in setting a mood than in telling a story. Finally, there's the issue of the lead character being only 17, played by an actor (Chalamet) who looks like he could be younger (though he was actually 20 when the movie was made). And the age of Hammer's character is never stated, though Hammer was pushing 30 during production and he looks a few years older. That makes this love story a little uncomfortable. Guadagnino wasn't smart enough to address that issue, or to trim 20 minutes from the film's 130-minute running time. (A scene where Chalamet and Hammer stop to get a drink of water from an old lady is one of many completely unnecessary scenes.) I would love to give \"Call Me by Your Name\" an unqualified rave. But too much of it felt like watching grass grow. It's a beautiful lawn, but still.",

This international production was written by James Ivory (from the famous Merchant Ivory films) with an Italian director and at least one American star. Although there is one incredible conversation between a father and son in the film, most of the story depends on the audience wanting a person who comes to work alongside a family in a professional capacity try to strike it up with what is essentially a high school student. Although the ensemble and crew are able to persuade the audience to root for these people, I think the uncomfortable nature of it means you are never entirely drawn into the drama and therefore are left a bit indifferent or emotionally vacant when the key moments come up. It is still worth the watch.",

Set in 1983 Call Me By Your Name follows 17 year old Elio (Timothee Chalamet) who lives in Northern Italy with his professor father (Michael Stuhlbarg) and his mother (Amira Caser). They must be some of the damn smartest people on the planet speaking 4 different languages and moving around depending on Elio's fathers research. During the summer Elio's father get's a new assistant to help him out (a sort of graduate student) named Oliver (Armie Hammer). Oliver and Elio don't exactly hit it off right off the bat. Oliver comes off as very American and arrogant at times while Elio himself is kind of finding himself. Soon enough Elio makes a leap of faith and the two begin a romance during the summer connecting on many different levels. The movie is extremely well done. It's a bit of a slow burn, but it had a great story to it all. There's a lot of themes here especially about realizing who you really are, the feelings of a first love and the importance of memories. The films two leads are great here and really have a chemistry that grows over time. It's a film that I truthfully can relate to regardless of the sexual preference of the two leads and I believe a lot of people could relate to in the future. It's a bit of a sad film overall that kind of thrusts itself right back into the viewer to remind ya of how life would have went back in 1983. It's a well done film and one that I recommend checking out especially for fans of indie films.",

What we end up with is a boring slog of a movie that strips away the thrill that should energize these characters.

Some gay readers have even claimed that it may be the author's deep-seated fantasy that he kept for so long until he released this book. And now, after 10 years since the novel became a canon for LGBT romance, Luca Guadagnino, an openly gay man, had skillfully put into screen every powerful exchange in the literature that finally gave light to that existential debate between Elio and Oliver:\n\nCall Me By Your Name IS NOT A GAY ROMANCE. It is a story of love not by two men but by two beings being vulnerable to each other who explored the boundaries of their beings being one in the search of infinity, the constant desire to be one organic whole. There's a huge reference to the works of Heidegger, Heraclitus, M.C. Escher, and even Descartes, despite not being mentioned directly in the novel, when Elio mocked him and argued that the pineal gland isn't where the soul and body meet.\n\nSo how did Aciman write it so well without being gay? Simple, aside from the fact that it isn't a gay novel as I argued, there's a plethora of literature about homosexual love that predates the contemporary notion of homosexuality (see Foucault's repressive hypothesis in History of Sexuality, 1976). History will tell you that there were no sexual labels prior to the rise of capitalism. Same-sex love existed in different parts of the world even before the East meets the Western world. The novel, I surmise, is Aciman's contemporary take on pederasty, noting the age gap between the two main characters and their academic status.\n\nSome critics see the lack of explicit sex scenes and frontal nudity as the downside of the film, that it is an implicit negotiation of the film with its straight audience and that it tolerates the homophobic resistance in cinema culture. Rather, I see it as an asset. Its current accolades could have been different, and even non-existent if not for that decision made by Guadagnino himself. It should be noted that the director revised its original screenplay which includes explicit scenes. At the end of the day, both the novel and the film are not about sex. It is about the passion between the two main characters who transcended their existential tension.\n\nNo actor can perfectly fit Elio's precocious nature but Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet. When I first saw the trailer, I said to myself, \"they found the right guy.\" This guy, despite his very young age, will definitely win the most coveted awards this season. Armie Hammer, on the other hand, is the perfect support Chalamet can get. Their chemistry is one of the best on screen.",

The icing on the cake (and a lot more than that) is the songs by Sufjan Stevens. They echo the bittersweetness of Elio's experience in the almost magical way.\n\nOn a personal level, it left an unprecedentedly lasting effect on me. The intensity of this kind of first love is what I've been longing for, but the way it ends is devastating and traumatizing. It leaves things to where they are beautiful but also there is sadness, helplessness and regret in letting go of what could have become more beautiful. Of course, everything could have gone the other way if it had been pursued between Elio and Oliver, so it may be the best to end where it ends. \n\nFinally, I want to recommend reading the book, especially the last chapter. It's a bit different from the movie and it has more details. In some sense, this is the part that completely destroys me emotionally.

We feel every beat of Elio's teenage mood swings and inner turmoil. When Elio finally kisses the 24 year-old Oliver (played by Armie Hammer), we can almost taste their sheer delight and sexual intensity. While the film features two young men, this universal tale is really about the ups and downs of young love. \n\nThe dialogue is clever and precise. There's a stand-out performance by actor Michael Stuhlbarg who plays both Elio's father and Oliver's archaeology professor.\n\nThe art direction is spectacular as we bike our way through the countryside of Lombardy, Italy. There's a dream-like quality in each frame because the film was shot entirely on 35-mm film. The accompanying musical score adds a light, summery soundscape to many of the scenes. \n\n\"Call Me By Your Name\" packs an emotional punch and it will leave you breathless by the last scene. This movie forces us to look back at our own teen years with bittersweet nostalgia. It reminds us of what it was like to have a first crush, a first kiss, and a first sexual encounter. The ache that the viewer feels is the wish that we could somehow go back in time-and do it the way Elio and Oliver did it.\n\nOne last thing: I will never be able to look at peaches the same way ever again.",

Gorgeously shot to take full advantage of its bucolic backdrop, the film will make you want to pack your bags and spend your Christmas break stomping grapes under a blazing Tuscan sun. If I'm being completely honest, though, the movie's overall impact is somewhat muted by its romance novel trappings; populated by upper-class liberals whiling away their summer in a spacious villa, the world in which the introverted Elio (a 17-year-old musical prodigy who reads the classics and speaks three languages) explores his intense attraction to the charming extrovert Oliver is not an instantly relatable one and risks keeping the audience at arm's length. Even more perplexing story-wise, their romance (which the pair take great pains to conceal from others) is not only known by Elio's father but quiely sanctioned by him. [Credit Michael Stuhlbarg with somehow selling this climatic revelation, along with the fatherly advice that comes with it - in a single scene, he radiates the level of compassion and unconditional love one hopes is awaiting every closeted teen struggling to come out.]\n\nRemoving the usual family tension you'd expect from such a coupling (especially one set in the early 1980's) strains plausibility, but it also allows the film to focus its attention squarely on the pair's unfolding romance, and it's largely on the strength of its two lead actors that the movie achieves near-greatness. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Armie Hammer deliver full-throated, deeply affecting performances that capture every stage of their characters' brief but intense bond, from the confusing anxiety that comes with unrequited love to the dizzying exhilation of its consummation to the profound grief that accompanies its end. Every awkward exchange, every stolen glance, every power shift in their evolving relationship will strongly resonate with viewers regardless of sexual identity or social background. Elio and Oliver's romance may exist mostly in a bubble, but the feelings they inspire in both each other and the audience couldn't be more real.",

They are the best on screen couple I've ever had the pleasure to watch.\n\nNow I really do not like LGBT romance films where there is no development on the character's relationships. Take Brokeback Mountain for example, I couldn't finish the film because there was no development in the relationship. But CMBYN has great character development and throughout the film you just really want them to make the move already.\n\nThe film has a fitting soundtrack which includes the beautiful nominated original song, Mystery of Love from Sufjan Stevens. This song really captures the emotion and the feel of the story, and it really should have won the Oscar instead.\n\nI have to give credit to director Luca Guadagdino. His vision is clear, and his scenes are filmed very carefully and beautifully, screenplay is flawless, the setting is perfect. Truly snubbed for Best Director nomination.\n\nThe ending credits of the film is also one of the most unique film endings I've ever seen. Yes, credits. The credits roll through while the scene is still playing and I truly can't reveal more without spoiling it. But it's really beautiful.\n\nGirls will find joy watching this film cause Timothee is shirtless for 75% of the film while Armie is in his short shorts 50% of the film.\n\nWith all that being said, I really don't see any flaws in the film. It's truly the best LGBT film of all time for me. This is one where I will be watching a few times over and over again. That's how much I love this.",

The camera resolves around the back of the movie's protagonist as he flirts with his father's graduate student after they have taken a long bike ride.   It puts in the viewer at the same perspective of the young man during his summer of self-discovery.    The object of his affection is within reach but at the same time eludes him.   It reflects on the joy, the sorrow, and the excitement of young love rarely depicted with such accuracy in the movies.   The speech the young man's father gives him at the end of the film brought me to tears.   A remarkable feat of directing and acting.   Highly recommended.",

There are no villains. There is no shocking moment of tragedy. There honestly isn't even an instance where characters consider raising their voices with each other unless you count the colorful Italian relatives who come over for dinner one night. \nThe film is beautifully put together, fantastically acted (Chalamet and Stuhlbarg in particular are great), and it will leave you delighted by the small touches scattered throughout by director Luca Guadagnino. (The series of shots showing bathing suits hanging up to dry will stay with me as a wonderful depiction of a summer going by). \nI was never overtly moved by this film (I don't believe it was built to overwhelm me) but I will forever bow down to the skillful way in which first love is depicted here.",

You get really invested in it really quick, and you feel the weight of this movie once it starts kicking in. The acting by Armie Hammer and Timothee Chalament is fucking great.

It is further validated by the time they spent together during non-filming hours.\nA consensual passion between an older twenty-something and a teen will probably be misunderstood in America especially during these times when so many cases of sexual abuse has come center stage.\nHowever, I have been clear that just as Elio seduced Oliver, by no means was I ever abused or forced.

Pictures are gorgeous, and their direction brings great depth. However, the sound editing is doesn't make sense. And for me, there's a gaping issue in how the characters' initial interest in one another is portrayed. At the beginning, they tend to lack the interest and curiosity experienced by those who are attracted to each other, even if they're confused, scared to be open, etc. It comes off more plain, like, \"Whelp, here's this guy living with us,\" and, \"Whelp, there's the boy in the house,\" rather than played subtly or coy. Nearly until they're making out, any clue-in to their interest is from the writing and direction, not so much from the acting. And throughout, there is a general lack of extra depth from the actors required for their gay characters. Not saying the nuances should be overtly gay or that it's not beautifully acted. It's well-acted. The character nuances created are believable for their sexual orientations. But something genuine falls short--maybe in their vulnerable sensitivities--or blankness in them, rather. It's like watching straight actors portraying heterosexual characters that find themselves in a homosexual situation--which, interestingly, is exactly what happened to these straight actors--they found themselves in a homosexual situation; hence, their lack of extra depth. Because of the portrayals at the beginning, the story felt like two heterosexuals realizing they have great potential as friends; and then suddenly, we float into gratuitous homosexuality, which is odd, until the audience realizes that this growing romantic love is the point of the story and then possibly decides to buy into that. True that Elio was discovering his bisexuality, but that demonstration of discovery is appropriately subtle in its writing while nearly absent in the performance. What is shared by the lead actors is good work, but just a few steps more at the beginning of the film would have made the portrayals and story completely believable.",

            "content": "THE CHARM OFFENSIVE - My Review of CALL ME BY YOUR NAME (4 Stars)\n\nSometimes the context in which a film is released can color one's perception of it.  With the spate of sexual assault and harassment allegations in recent months, it's almost impossible not to see CALL ME BY YOUR NAME, the new feature from director Luca Guadagnino (A BIGGER SPLASH) and writer James Ivory based on the novel by  Andre Aciman through that lens.  The story of a 17-year-old boy's 1983 summer of love with a 24-year-old man can't help but have a whiff of pedophilia about it, despite the fact that the age of consent in Italy, where the story takes place, is 14.  Perhaps, in years to come, where the film is allowed a separation from its year of release, people may discover a film of uncommon naturalness and grace, despite the ever-present creep factor.\n\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet (LADY BIRD, MISS STEVENS) plays Elio Perlman, who spends the summer in Northern Itay with his parents.  His father, played by the remarkable Michael Stuhlbarg (A SERIOUS MAN) is an arts professor who each year hosts a research assistant at their villa.  In walks Oliver (Armie Hammer) as that assistant, with his movie star looks and Connecticut Country Club vibe.  When he's not reviewing slides of naked male torsos with Professor Perlman, Oliver gets a guided bike tour by Elio of the quaint village. They develop a sweet friendship, with either barely seeming to feel attraction for the other in the film's first half.  \n\nIt's a very slow, Euro style buildup, reminiscent to me of the languorous rhythms of Vittorio de Sica's 1970 classic, THE GARDEN OF THE FINZI-CONTINIS.  It's a glorious, sun-dripped piece of filmmaking, filled with slightly missed connections and an incredible representation of a young man's first times.  Chalamet truly sells the guileless charms of his first sexual encounter with a woman, his long-time friend Marzia (Esther Garrel).  The frankness of the sexuality here includes his delirious reaction to the sex and a visible erection under his pants when they make out, and truly harkens back to a style of European cinema we don't get enough of anymore.  It's not that we lack sex and nudity in films, it's the believable push-pull, the unapologetic attraction seen here that feels refreshing.  \n\nOnce Elio and Oliver start to connect, the film enters its ravishing realm.  The care taken with the beats of touching each other, or watching each other pass through their shared bathroom, feels like a connection I haven't seen before. Chalamet and Hammer are fantastic actors, and clearly they worked hard to make this connection work, but the issues I had with the film kept intruding on a splendid piece of filmmaking.  Casting is such an important process, and I have no doubt that Guadagnino saw that indefinable something when these two got together.  All of this is undeniable.  The problem, for me, is that their physical presence makes this a hard sell.  Chalamet, with his skinny frame, looks way younger than 17 while Hammer, a tall hunk of a man,  looks many years older than 24.  This serves to widen the age gap past the point of it being \"ok\".  Despite the fact that Elio initially acts as the aggressor, with Oliver demuring, it just doesn't look right.  I'm not saying that people in their late teens don't have sexual desires and experiences.  I'm not even saying it's illegal in the film.  It's not.  I'm simply talking about my reaction to their vast physical differences.  I can't even say Guadagnino should have landed on different actors.  Perhaps chemistry trumps everything.  My struggle, however, almost took me out of the film at times.\n\nLuckily, there's so much that's great.  For those who like a moody, slow film with great care paid to the subtle details of human interaction, this will feel like a treasure trove.  There's also a monologue by Stuhlbarg guaranteed to break your heart.  Many will talk about the soon-to-be-famous peach scene, literally dripping with sensuality, but my jaw dropped when Stulbarg's beautiful words and stunning vulnerability held the screen for a scene which puts the entire story in a whole new context.  \n\nMany will call this a gay love story, but, in reality, the characters are bisexuals, active ones.  It's a unique look at the subject, with both Elio and Oliver feeling what they feel one moment, and feeling something else in another.  I bought it.  \n\nThe lyrical way Guadagnino tells this story gets a great assist by cinematographer Sayombhu Mukdeeprom, who creates such a vivid sense of place and time.  The scene in which Oliver dances with a woman beside a car parked in the town square feels so 80s without overplaying its hand.  The use of \"Love My Way\" by the Psychedelic Furs couldn't be more perfect.  This is a film, where bit by bit, we feel the impact Oliver has on Elio.  It's written across his face in one extended shot. Sure, this is yet another coming-of-age film, but we truly come to understand how this relationship will impact the lives of its characters.  Some will see past the inherent problems with the film, while others are sure to throw this in with our Spacey/Weinstein cultural moment and dismiss it, perhaps unfairly.  Either way, I have a feeling people will look back at this film in 20 years as a cinematic landmark of sorts.",

I understood, for example, the identity issues that motivated the film's central relationship, but I didn't feel a convincing depth or chemistry in the characterizations on which it was based. The relationship seemed devoid of genuine, non-sexualized warmth.\n\n \n\nEven more basic, however, the film aims to idealize a relationship that I experienced as disturbingly narcissistic and exploitative. Toward the end of the film, for example, the 17-year-old protagonist, in the afterglow of recent male admiration, callously and unnecessarily rejects the innocent overtures of his erstwhile girlfriend. The film's few admirable sequences (the father-son talk near the end, for example) fail to undo this oppressive atmosphere of cool, self-centered narcissism.",

            "content": "Not to single out this particular premise, but films revolving around gay couples have been terrific over the last decade or so. There was a spark when 2005's Brokeback Mountain was released, which eventually brought us to foreign films like Blue Is the Warmest Colour being nominated for a Golden Globe or Moonlight winning best picture at the Oscars. Call Me by Your Name is the latest film to probably receive many nominations in the coming months, and believe me, the praise is not false. Being a fan of 2015's A Bigger Splash, I was looking forward to Luca Guadagnino's follow-up feature film, and I believe this to be an improvement in the best ways. Exploring the hardships of life and what it means to just kick back and relax every now and then, Call Me by Your Name is a film that's been sticking with me since my viewing of it. While it admittedly won't be able to draw in everyone to the theatres, here is why I believe this to be a fantastic, award-worthy picture.\n\nWritten by James Ivory and directed by Luca Guadagnino, Call Me by Your Name follows a family that lets Oliver, an older graduate student, live in their home for the summer. While this is a common thing, what's not too common is that Elio, their son, will eventually grow romantic feelings toward this man, convincing him to become his lover for the summer. From the age gap between them and having to hide it from the family, their situation isn't an easy one, nor will it be for some audience members, but it really is a wonderful story. This is easily a story that could've stirred up controversy if it hadn't been done with taste, and because of how it was made, I just couldn't take my eyes off the screen. This was made entirely possible by the incredibly devoted performances by Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Armie Hammer.\n\nHammer has had his ups and downs through the years, appearing in Oscar-winning films as well as some of the worst films of the year, so his performance here was the most shocking to me. Yes, he's been talent in nearly everything he's been in, but he really gave his all in this performance and I honestly don't think he'll ever be better than he was in Call Me by Your Name. On the other hand, young Chalamet has a very bright future ahead of him. Being a relatively new actor, his chemistry with Hammer was impeccably astounding. Their relationship took a while to grow on me, but once it completely won me over, I found myself wondering if there was anything to really complain about.\n\nIf I had to complain about anything, it would be in its extreme pressure to try your patience. There are very long sequences of silence, making you relax and take in either a romantic moment or the scenery around them, which I also found poetic at the same time, so I actually have trouble coming up with issues, but I have to admit that I did find the movie slow at times. Yes, it's meant to be slow, which is why that complaint isn't exactly valid, but I just have to be honest.\n\nIn the end, this is a truly remarkable piece of dramatic filmmaking and there are some very memorable scenes that keep replaying themselves in my head. One scene in particular that involves Elio and his father Mr. Perlman (played magnificently by Michael Stuhlbarg) toward the end had me in tears. From the brilliantly written screenplay, to the poetic cinematography, to the terrifically calm direction, Call Me by Your Name isn't a movie that I would send the average moviegoer out to see, but if you're a hardcore film fan, I think you'll end up loving this movie.",

When Oliver, a handsome 20-something American intern arrives to help Elio's father, the two strike up more than a friendship in this beautiful, seductive film full of unspeakable longings, furtive glances and slow burning desires. Luca Guadagnino's film is delicate and pristine to look at and often his camera does nothing but sits there capturing the action as it unfolds organically. His pacing is unhurried and his use of music and Sufjan Stevens' songs effectively heightens the emotive drama bubbling just beneath James Ivory's screenplay that leans definitely towards the artistic side, subtly teasing out a simple yet tender romance. However, its treatment of the central relationship is so polite and tasteful, I end up feeling cold and dispassionate about the film. Timothee Chalamet who plays Elio is natural and charismatic (and a linguist to boot) and proves to be an emerging talent but I am less convinced by Armie Hammer's Oliver who is mostly an enigmatic object of desire. But it is Michael Stuhlberg as Elio's father who steals the film with a moving, Oscar worthy performance in an elegantly written and heartfelt scene towards the end. Despite all the 5-star praises this film has landed, I thought it is on par with the recent God's Own Country and if I must choose, I probably prefer the passion in that film just a titch more than this one.",

As the expository music and brief glances into scenes cooled down into proper film chapters, that unique initial charm wore off, but what remained was still an amazing movie. It felt nostalgic, but dangerous. Exciting, but calm. The performances were great, the cinematography was excellent and the score was absolutely fantastic. And the dialogue transitions between English and Italian were so seemless, I don't think enough people are giving it credit for that. 'Call Me By Your Name' is destined to be a classic.",

            "content": "I was fortunate to watch Luca Guadagnino's Call Me By Your Name at the Festival du Nouveau Cinema. It's a wonderful gay-themed romance drama that manages to strike a balance between love and lust, without over-punishing its characters with the typical tragic turn-outs that I find many queer films represent. That's not to say that everything about the film is necessarily happy, otherwise it would be a boring narrative. It's the unpredictable nature of human beings that is well portrayed and keeps the audience absorbed to the unfolding drama.\n\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet delivers an especially realistic and moving performance as Elio, a horny but ultimately sensitive teenager who struggles with his sexual awakening as his initial dislike for Oliver turns into an attraction. Armie Hammer plays a great supporting role in adding to the already charged chemistry between Elio and Oliver, complemented by playful and even humorful attitudes.\n\nAlthough the film could've likely taken place in the present day, the 1983 time period stays true to the source material, while exploring how homosexuality was handled then, as well as showing how characters would kill time. One of the supporting characters in particular who finds out about Elio's sexuality, of whom I won't provide an identity as it would spoil the drama, does an unexpectently amazing job with the role, which left a few audience members in tears.\n\nThe film being set in Italy not only complements the film's lush cinematography, but it also provides a bit of historical context as to why the characters are there, which of course inevitably parallels and foreshadows certain events. And its hot Summer weather makes the perfect excuse for both Elio and Oliver to be shirtless in many scenes, maybe almost to a gratuitous point, but that very excuse is what adds to the growing attraction between the two characters.\n\nThe music score is largely piano-based, as it reflects Elio's own musical talent. The non-diegetic overlays do get problematic when the songs are abruptly cut, as the film's only real problem that I found was the rough editing. Seeing and hearing Elio play however will have you gaping with the sheer passion and intensity that Chalamet puts into character.\n\nYou'll also learn the meaning behind the title by watching Call Me By Your Name, which officially comes out November 24th. It is a sensual yet romantic piece of cinema, as far as queer representation goes, while not being as tragic as other queer-themed films, and while it may not cover the full extent of homosexuality in the 80s and does fall upon a few plot conveniences, everything else about the film will keep you entranced even for its ~130min runtime. It was nice to see a packed theatre for it, showing that more and more people want gay or queer-themed films to happen and this one was much needed when Hollywood cannot provide such representation.",

The direction and editing were poor, with many short scenes leading nowhere and having little impact. The settings and cinematography were very pleasing, but the overall pace was too slow - during the first 90 mins. very little happened on screen. My main gripe was Hammer, who I found totally unbelievable both in his actions and emotions. It was like he had walked straight from the set of 'Days of Our Lives'. His acting was average, appearing very wooden and uncomfortable throughout. This resulted in his character appearing creepy and pervy. The saving grace for this film was Chalamet, who shone brilliantly. Overall the film was too long given the limited content, the background piano music and songs didn't quite fit, and (surprisingly) I just couldn't connect emotionally.

The professor's teenage son (Timothee Chalamet as Elio) accompanies him in running errands and exploring the idyllic town. Their friends and families are instantly drawn to the effortless charisma and confidence of Oliver, but not Elio. He is resisting it, even competing with him at one point, until he finally lets his guard down. And boy, he comes at Oliver really strong. Over the course of six weeks, what started as mere infatuation turns into a passionate affair. Call Me By Your Name is sensual, without being overtly erotic. It simmers with sexual tension from the most subtle exchanges -- secret glances, longing stares, stolen kisses, and flirtatious massages. Even a simple caress on the lips or touching of their feet is highly romanticized, which is exactly how a teenager feels during first love. And as they are about to consummate their love in one of their midnight rendezvouses, the camera pans away. It's a bold choice and one that I fully support. It's consistent with the subdued but elegant approach to their love story. The chemistry between the leads is palpable. Timothee, in this star-making turn, portrays a love-struck teenager with authentic naivete. His eyes simultaneously filled with yearning, confusion, and excitement. It's a film overflowing with so many great moments -- the father's monologue (Michael Stuhlbarg), Elio's final breakdown at the fireplace, and of course, the \"Call me by your name and I'll call you by mine\" scene. Call Me By Your Name could easily become the next Before Sunrise, i.e. the best romantic film of all-time.\n\nPS: I want Sufjan Stevens to compose songs for my emo moments.

His father, played by the supporting actor of the year Michael Stuhlbarg, is an archaeologist who takes in a grad student every summer to mentor them. When this year's grad student Oliver (Armie Hammer) comes to stay tensions arise, passion overtakes, and time breaks hearts.\u00a0\n\nCall Me By Your Name is one of my favorite films, not only of 2017, but of all time. The way Luca Guadagnino directs this film is breathtaking. His direction is very sensual, not only are you watching the beautiful scenery of the Italian summer, or hearing the beautiful dialogue spoken from the actors' mouths and the amazing score that backdrops them, but he crafted this film to make it as if you taste what they are tasting, smell what they are smelling, and feel what they are touching.\u00a0\n\nIn addition to the directing and the perfect score and soundtrack, the acting is what really brings this movie home. Armie Hammer gives his best performance to date. Long gone are the days of the Lone Ranger as Hammer brings a warm and heartfelt performance. Michael Stuhlbarg continues to shine this year in yet another supporting role, but this one takes the cake. Towards the end of the movie his character delivers a monologue in THAT DAMN SCENE\u00a0that leaves you reeling. It is one of the most honest movie moments in a movie already filled with honesty and realism. But most of all, Timothee Chalamet shines. At just 22 years old, he brings a performance to the table that not only rivals his elders in the Oscar race this year, but should undoubtedly blow them out of the water. He envelops the character of a young man struggling with his feelings and makes you feel as though your not watching a character, but rather somebody's life unfold. The final scene brought me to tears and solidifies Chalamet as a phenomenal actor and one who will most definitely be on everyone's radar.\n\nI found this movie refreshing in the supporting characters reactions and how they handled what was happening. There was no hate. No shame. Just love naturally occurring. The only antagonist in the movie was time.\n\nThis movie does take\u00a0its time and earns its end. At a running time of just over two hours, when it ends, you want to stay here with the characters for even longer. You relate to the characters on a personal level, no matter your orientation. It made me feel as if I were 17 again and falling in love for the first time again.\n\nCall Me By Your Name, in my opinion, is the best film of 2017. This movie is the kind of movie that made me fall in love with film in the first place. It is a master work. It is incredible. Go watch it as soon as possible.",

Eu acho que o Armie \u00e9 um pouco velho demais para o papel de Oliver, o que faz a diferen\u00e7a entre os personagens parecer monumental, e n\u00e3o os 7 anos. O filme \u00e9 extremamente fiel ao livro, com exce\u00e7\u00e3o do final (felizmente n\u00e3o temos o longo e tedioso cap\u00edtulo em Roma, que n\u00e3o serve para nada). Com uma continua prevista, vai ser interessante como eles ir\u00e3o contar o final da hist\u00f3ria, precisando desenvolver coisas que n\u00e3o est\u00e3o no livro. Timoth\u00e9e est\u00e1 fant\u00e1stico, aquela cena da lareira \u00e9 outro n\u00edvel, mas o Michael merece mais reconhecimento, epecialmente pela cena em que fala com o Elio na biblioteca, que \u00e9 exatamente igual a como acontece no livro.",

It was made with so much love and respect to the original story that it really would have been impossible to fail. Guadagnino is a master of cinema, every single frame,every single scene was as it should have been, everything was beautiful. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is gonna be an Oscar winner at such a young age, and he's totallu worth it,cause this guy is pure art. Such talent at such young age makes you wonder how much more he can bring to the craft. Armie Hammer! Armie Hammer's performance was as sincere as it should have been,his best role so far.  Everything about this movie made me feel like summer, made me dream about times long-gone, loves long-lost that left a mark in me forever,and it also made me hungry for such a love where to become one. \"Call Me By Your Name\" could be translated as a universal love story but the connection and chemstry we see and feel on screen works amazingly the way it is. Aciman was unapologetic about his story and Luca managed to capture that,he shows the raw beauty of it all without flinching once. Everything this movie stands for is translated to the audience through Michael Stuhlbarg's heartfelt speech,but the core of the movie the essense of the movie is carried in its title. \"Call Me By Your Name\", let us be one.",

Call Me By Your Name is an example of prestige picture that transcends the current norm of superhero pictures with it's strong sensitivity and uncompromising sensuality. James Ivory's screenplay and Luca Guadagnino's direction offers an unforgettable experience for audiences. Armie Hammer and Timothee Chamalet are both stars and challenge the audience's perceptions of love, friendship and lust. There is little that hasn't already been said about the Sundance triumph but Guadagnino has certainly created a masterpiece. Call Me By Your Name offers my highest recommendation!",
