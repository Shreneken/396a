            "content": "Excelente película, una joya cinematográfica y de lo mejor del catalogo de Netflix. Es una película muy buena, emotiva y entretenida. Cuenta una historia bastante triste sobre un matrimonio que decide divorciarse y como llevan a cabo el juicio por esto. Esta cargada de escenas muy emotivas, logrando conmoverme en bastantes momentos. También cuenta con actuaciones brillantes de Adam Driver, Scarlett Johansson y Laura Dern; actuaciones dignas de un Oscar. Es una cinta que logra atraparte desde el primer momento, y si bien es lenta y puede resultarte aburrida, en mi caso me entretuvo mucho y su ritmo lento no me aburrió para nada, se toma todo el tiempo posible para que empatices con los personajes y puedas juzgarlos y fijarte que hicieron mal y bien. También hay que destacar el soundtrack, que en parte es gracias a este que es muy emotiva la película. La considero una cinta ideal para ver con tu pareja y opinar sobre las acciones de cada uno o que te puede servir, como leí, para charlar sobre los errores que hay en esa pareja y solucionarlos. En conclusión, me parece una cinta brillante, llena de momentos emotivos y memorables, con actuaciones excelentes y con una trama bastante fuerte y cargada de emoción. Muy recomendada.",

Rabbia, sconforto, difficoltà a lasciarsi andare, piccoli gesti significativi, sguardi che si incrociano annodandosi con l'odio o con la tenerezza, disagio, inadeguatezza, solitudine, paura, voglia e difficoltà nel ripartire e nel rinunciare. Le colpe e le assoluzioni dei protagonisti vengono esposte con empatia, lasciando allo spettatore non il giudizio ma il compito di sfiorarle con uno sguardo umano per intercettare le miriadi di sfaccettature di una relazione, scoprendone o riconoscendone la moltitudine di riflessi e cercando di comprenderla profondamente. Anche quando questa si avvia alla conclusione, e forse soprattutto allora, se ne può cogliere pienamente la vastità delle variegate emozioni che la compongono.",

You really feel for his character and buy into him really caring about his son. The casting in general was noteworthy and I found it interesting how it wrapped itself up, and it was very emotional.

I mean, we're all dysfunctional to some degree; the challenge is to stick with it, to seek answers, to learn to be unselfish, to learn to accept and validate...and to become always more functional.  It is possible, I know by experience.  Why not go for \"alive\" at all costs?  Why not seek healing?  Why not act like adults and let the child have as functional a childhood as possible?  There is a lot of good stuff out there - the Gottman Institute for one - it would be completely plausible for two intelligent, warm, real people to seek reconciliation and to always be glad they did.  Instead we have to nod to the prevailing weltzschmerz and go on singing our sad little tune.",

            "content": "Películas como \"Marriage Story\" me hacen amar los conflictos minimalistas, apoyándose casi completamente de los conflictos internos muy bien marcados de los protagonistas. Haciendo a la película directa, y siempre con un propósito en cada escena; mostrando pequeñas cosas o acciones que de poco a poco llevan al increíble clímax de la película, apoyándose y confiando totalmente en los actores, con planos cerrados y creando un suspenso únicamente con los gestos de los protagonistas, siempre teniendo un buen balance y nunca sintiéndose exagerados. Marcando muy bien tanto los puntos altos como los bajos de los personajes en el trascurso de la historia, con este realismo que debe tener este género. Uno de los contras que le encuentro a la película es que del segundo acto hacia delante, la película nos muestra más el lado humano del personaje de Adam Driver, haciendo que empaticemos más con él; Dejando de lado al personaje de Scarlett Johansson, que aunque nunca la prescribimos como de cierta manera \"el antagonista de la historia\", si se nota una evolución menor en su personaje, haciendo que empaticemos más con el. Los personajes de apoyo aunque no tienen un peso real en la historia, están bien marcados y teniendo un propósito claro en la película. Para mi la principal virtud de esta película esta en contarnos únicamente la historia del \"Matrimonio\" de los protagonistas, haciendo a la película personal, no necesitando un extenso cast, ni sets \"increíbles\" para contar una historia; la historia se engrandece únicamente con estos dos personajes, entendiendo el conflicto de cada uno y viendo de una manera super natural como se vuelve la trama central de la película.  Sientes que conoces a estos personajes, ya sea en como los planos abiertos están realizados o en la decoración de los sets.

Marriage story muestra el divorcio de una manera cruda y realista como solo Noah Boumbach lo puede hacer; el excelente desarrollo de los personajes hace que se tenga una apreciación única de estos y, así mismo, las magistrales interpretaciones del reparto permiten sentirnos como los personajes, comprenderlos, sentir su frustración, y, incluso, llegamos a tomar partido en esta batalla en la que no hay reglas; también va mostrando como va afectando la vida de los involucrados y como influyen las demás personas de su circulo familiar, laboral y amistoso, destruyendo cualquier tipo de esperanza. La increíble y extraordinaria dirección y fotografía hacen que te metas de lleno en la historia y sientes como si estuvieras ahí presente. Su memorable banda sonora te adentra en su atmósfera emotiva y la mezcla de todos estos, componen una verdadera orquesta de emociones y un bello retrato familiar. Para terminar, aparte de ser un reflejo de la realidad nos deja claro como es la falta de comunicación lo que extingue una relación y no \"la falta de amor\". En conclusión una cinta maravillosa, emotiva e irónicamente romántica. 9,2 de 10",

The result is a somewhat odd blend of tones, light and humorous at times, and then suddenly dark and bitter. You might think that sounds kinda realistic, but the reality is it feels a bit… off, like there aren't a lot of powerful moments because of Baumbach's conscious effort not to take it too far in either direction. That being said, there are a few moments that hit exactly as they should (there's a fantastic argument scene) and I found that the film worked best when it explored the stronger, raw emotions of the individual characters – love, hate, anger – instead of documenting the process of divorce itself (lawyers, houses, money etc.).

Whether it is in the production design where a scene is taking place, an unforgettable line in the screenplay, or the lovely score in the background. It is unique in the way of showing the anger and hate being overpowered by the love and friendship between these two people. This is brought to life by the remarkable performances of Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson.\n\nTo also judge this film just by the fight scene Film Twitter turned into a viral meme is a complete disrespect to the film itself. It is the minor scenes where we are impacted most, such as:\n\n- Charlie does not know what to order during the lawyers' meeting \n- Charlie waiting for his child on Halloween, falling asleep on the couch dressed as Frankenstein in the process.\n- Nicole rushing to her room after talking to Charlie and breaking down into sobs from pain and anger after a small argument. \n- Laura's Derns iconic 2 minute monologue about the standards and pressure society puts on mothers compared to fathers (where after viewing that scene, I immediately knew she had the Oscar).\n\nThese scenes are what make the film more beautiful and heartbreaking.

But what makes the film different from other divorce films such as Kramer vs Kramer is the use of comedy and creating a lighter visual experience. Don't get it wrong though, Marriage Story is a sad film overall, but it's the comedy that helps alleviate the pain of seeing people fall out of love. Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver do a splendid job of digging into their characters and providing growth throughout the duration of the film. They display a variety of emotions and play their characters in a very grounded nature. Laura Dern is a definite standout as the cocky but well intentioned divorce lawyer for Scarlett's character in the film. Azhy Robertson, who plays the son of the couple, does a great job of playing the child who just can't seem to grasp the magnitude of what his parents are going through. The real star of the movie however is definitely Noah Baumbach. He delivers a story that could have been dreadful to watch, but provides it in such a way that by the time the movie ends, it leaves in a bittersweet mood.

            "content": "Noah Baumbach's incisive and compassionate look at a marriage breaking up and a family staying together. (Written by Netflix)\n\nMarriage Story is one of the best if not the best films that talk about two couples who get separated/divorced. Everything about is real and genuine especially the dialogues. It also has very few comedy in it so the film doesn't seem dull/boring which gave the film a special taste. \n\nFirstly, in my opinion, this is Scarlett Johansson's best performance so far. She succeeded in giving us that great character of the wife Nicole. She gave us one of the best long take scenes of the film, especially that the film has many of these scenes. But, this one specifically was the best because it was focused on her and just her, it felt so real/genuine with her beautiful acting. Adam Driver also gave us one of the best performances of his career for sure. anytime when he was crying or shouting, it all felt so real. In any scene where the two actors were together, it felt like a boom because both of their performances were better than the other, and the famous scene where the two were having an argument, proves it.\n\nSecondly, Noah Baumbach is such an amazing director and screenwriter. When you watch a Noah Baumbach film, it will be obvious because his scripts are written in a way that would make any scene or dialogue seem so real/genuine. His way of directing too is so unique and amazing especially in this film, the cinematography and the transitions were so smooth and well done. This film's dialogues really reminded me of Frances Ha (2012) that was directed by him and written by him & his partner Greta Grewing who is also an amazing screenwriter, and we saw how amazing she is in Lady Bird (2017) and Little Women (2019) that were both directed by her. Noah Baumbach & Greta Grewing are some of the best directors & screenwriters. \n\nOne thing I didn't like about the film is that I felt like sometimes the story of one side only wasn't being told as much as the other side which seemed unfair and we didn't get to know what this person thinks or what their opinion is as much as we did with the other side. Also, I felt like I needed to know more about their backstory or about other situations that would explain to the audience more about their relationship/love. But, all reasons for the two getting divorced were very reasonable and presented in a way that people nowadays would relate to which made the film unique, related, and so real with all of its dialogues & scenes.\n\nA beautiful film that's filled with great acting performances, directing, cinematography, and a little bit of comedy to cool down the energy of the film.\n\nMy rating is 9/10",

            "content": "\"TAKES MY BREATH AWAY\" LOVE FILMS\nby Timothy J. Verret\n\nI'm as drawn to love films as a beautiful and majestic horse is drawn to water. I create so much about and from the notion of love that it sometimes is hard for me to take a decent, deep breath. Here are 10 (actually 11) films about love (or the lack thereof) that \"take my breath away\" and heal my still-sometimes-very-broken heart (BOTH!):\n\n1. SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE (1998):\nThis would indeed be my all-time favorite love film because it's got Shakespeare and it's got that message: \"Love is the ONLY inspiration.\" This film is inspired by a great and awe-inspiring love for acting, writing, directing, and how passion engages all of these things in one love film. Even if this film was not an ode to why Shakespeare wrote sonnets in the first place, the scene where Viola is onstage in a staged production of Shakespeare's ROMEO AND JULIET and William is lovingly looking at her from the wings is more than enough of a reason why I adore this love film. Viola loves William, William loves Viola, and the music takes us away to just this one moment of two looks and two smiles all looked and smiled in the name of a beautiful, all-encompassing love. That scene alone \"takes my breath way\" every time I see it. Even though this film is #10 on my all-time favorite films' list, it is solidly #1 on my all-time favorite love films' list (I guess you could say, \"so the last shall be first, and the first shall be last\" [Matthew 20:16]). 😉\n\n2. SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE (1973):\nSwedish director Ingmar Bergman is not known for gushy and silly love films, but this film IS a very serious love film because Bergman gives us both the glory and grime of a marriage dissolving. In true and typical Bergman fashion, each scene of this film is a very serious \"take my breath away,\" because the truth and turmoil at the heart of this marriage ending are about as real as my hand in front of my face. Liv Ullmann and Erland Josephson as Marianne and Johan give towering performances. I will never forget the scene where Marianne and Johan go to the lawyer's office to sign the divorce papers and literally get into a fist fight. After the fight (and the marriage) is over, they both with their tattered hair and hearts sign the divorce papers. This film is as stunning as it is sacrificial. Marriage IS sacrifice and when that's not there, stunning is any marriage's dissolvement. I probably could have listed a handful of Ingmar Bergman films that explore the theme of this kind of intense love, but I have to keep this list as brief as possible.😉\n\n3. MARRIAGE STORY (2019):\nVery much like SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE, this film is haunting and often horribly uneasy to sit through. Scarlett Johansson as Nicole and Adam Driver as Charlie give exceptionally riveting performances as a married couple with way too big egos (she is an actress and he is a theatre director and if that's not \"way too big egos,\" I don't know what is). I will never forget the scene where Nicole goes to Charlie's apartment and they are in the throws of so much anger and so much hurt that the walls of Charlie's apartment are about to come down. Johansson's Nicole delivers to Driver's Charlie the line that is THE line where love hoped to save this marriage and love can't save this marriage intersect, \"You're so merged with your own selfishness, you don't even identify it as selfishness anymore!\" That line \"took my breath away\" because I totally identified with it. A marriage on its way to a divorce is all about selfishness unidentified anymore. The proclaimed egos of both partners \"win out\" and when ego \"wins out,\" everything is \"lost in\" a marriage war of two \"way too big egos.\"\n\n4. THE DANISH GIRL (2015):\nIt's so cool that this film is #4 on this list, as #4 is my spiritual number. It's also cool that this film is #4 on my all-time favorite films' list, as well. The story of Gerda and Einar (Lily) Wegener is what love films should always be about: The sacrifice one partner needs to make for a marriage to survive (often times in a marriage, both partners have to make sacrifices). Gerda makes the ultimate sacrifice by accepting that her husband, Einar, believes he is a woman and wants to have an operation to become Lily, the woman he always was on the inside. Anyone else that I can think of in Gerda's position would have said in response to this, \"no way, no how….this marriage is OVER!\" Gerda loves Einar so much that she is willing to do just about anything (and she does) to keep their love alive. Alicia Vikander (Oscar winner for Best Supporting Actress) is an absolute and complete revelation in her performance as Gerda, and Eddie Redmayne completely and totally seals the deal in his performance in this film to make him my all-time favorite actor next to Joaquin Phoenix. I swear I could go on and on about how this film \"takes my breath away\" at every twist and turn where love is concerned but, once again, I'm needing to be brief here.😉\n\n5. YENTL (1983):\nVery similar to THE DANISH GIRL, this film is not your conventional love film. It's about a woman who loves this man who thinks a woman is a man, this man who loves another woman who is also a woman but since he can't have this other woman, the man asks a woman to marry this other woman so he can be close to this other woman, and a woman who this man thinks is a man marries this other woman, and if none of that \"takes your breath away,\" I'm not sure what ever would! This film \"takes my breath away\" because it's simply about the lengths and heights and depths we find ourselves reaching for in the throes (or thrown) of love. And because I am a huge Barbra Streisand fan and this is Barbra's best film EVER, I can't think of any other love film that pleases and excites me more than this one. And never mind that it is mainly because of Barbra Streisand and my love for her that helped me to believe that I could ever be someone someday who could love someone someday. Now, that \"takes my breath away.\"\n\n6. WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? (1966):\nWhile most in a million years would never call this film a \"love film,\" I do because it's a film about the absence of love in a marriage, the absence that is SO common in a lot of marriages, and an absence so penetrable that the married couple in this film actually make up that they have a child to keep the marriage bearable. Edward Albee's play and Mike Nichols' film adaptation are what I love most about stories where love has flown the coop (if it was ever in the coop in the first place), i.e., the dissection and probing of the insides of people who are losing their identity because love has become nonexistent while brutality and mean-spiritedness are what's left to exist. Elizabeth Taylor, known for her striking beauty, goes from \"riches to rags\" in her physical beauty and gives us an \"ugly\" Martha, a force of nature who is as forceful as she is vulnerable. Taylor, Best Actress Oscar winner) gives what I consider the very best female performance ever captured on film. Richard Burton as George and George Segal as Nick are also excellent, but it's the other female performance of Sandy Dennis as Honey (Best Supporting Actress Oscar winner) that makes this love film truly one that \"takes my breath away\" every time I see it….and I've seen it a lot!😉\n\n7. TESS (1980):\nIf there can be any love film that is truly lovely to look it, it would be this film. Based on Thomas Hardy's classic novel of the same name, Roman Polanski directed this film that makes the novel come breathtakingly and beautifully alive. This film \"takes my breath away\" not just because it's pretty to look at but also because it is rapturous and daring to expose seduction between a man and a woman as actually rape, and how that one act of domination produces shame that stays with the victim. I know that one's shame is to be nailed to The Cross of Jesus but for some, death is the one way, and maybe the only way, to be rid of that shame. Nastassja Kinski as Tess might not be the best actress who ever lived, but Polanksi knew exactly what he was doing by casting her in the title role. Because Kinski was a relative unknown and maybe because Polanski knew she wasn't the greatest actress around, it was precisely these two very things that allowed Kinski to inhabit Tess as bright-eyed innocent, and naïve. A well-known and a great actress would have destroyed these precious traits, so thank God Polanski and Kinski didn't. There's one scene of a closeup of Tess with the brightest yellow sun behind her that to this day, every time I see a sun like that, it \"takes my breath away,\" and I call it, \"the Tess sun.\" LOVE THAT! ❤️\n\n8. THE WAY WE WERE (1973):\nIt certainly makes sense that I would have two Barbra Streisand films on this list but even if I didn't love Streisand, this film would be on it anyway and probably most others' \"love film\" list. It's the ultimate love story of the girl over there and the guy over here and how there and here come together and we are all the better for being present to witness that. The odds are that two beautiful actors like Redford and Streisand couldn't possibly go wrong in a beautiful love film that ends with a closing scene that still \"takes my breath away.\" Streisand's Katie and Redford's Hubbell are looking at each other after having separated when famous Streisand takes that famous hand and famously brushes away that famous hair from Redford's famous face. \"See ya', Katie.\" \"See ya' Hubbell.\" See me balling my eyes out.😥😥\n\n9. CASABLANCA (1942):\nWhile not the film I would have included on my \"take my breath away\" love films' list, I'm including it because it's on the top of the list for two of my favorite people and because any film with an actor or actress with the last name of \"Bergman\" should be on any film list I compile (see #2 for that \"other Bergman\" film). That said, I have seen this film and I remember loving it very much. Many \"love film\" aficionado's are divided into two camps where this film's ending is concerned: One group wants Rick to let Ilsa board that plane to Lisbon with Laszlo for The Resistance, while the other group says, \"C'mon! Rick and Ilsa forever! We're not talking about The Resistance here! We're talking about love!\" This film reminds us that love doesn't always end as victorious as The Resistance, but what we cannot \"resist\" is that we loved in the first place. That is usually enough for any kind of love to take flight.\n\n10. IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT (1934) and SOMEWHERE IN TIME (1980):\nI admit I was torn between which of these films to include to round out the top 10 \"take my breath away\" love films, until it dawned on me that both films have something very much in common: The element of time when and where love is lost and/or found. IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT is simple enough to say love can happen one night, whereas SOMEWHERE IN TIME says one night is fine, but true love cannot be contained by the element of time. Love can happen one night, sure, and then more nights can happen after that, but sometimes you have to go \"somewhere in time\" to find that love again. Whether one night or \"somewhere in time,\" love alters us to our very core and we do search time and space to find it, but there are no guarantees that the Jericho Walls (reference to the ending of IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT) will stay up or come down when love happens in just one night or \"somewhere\" outside of space and time for a lifetime.\n\nNow, I'm not currently in a love relationship (unless you count Jesus) but if I were, my partner would need to have seen AT LEAST one of these films. If not, watching AT LEAST one of these films is essential if any partner who loves me expects to \"take my breath away.\" 😉❤️",

Sin embargo, el proceso que esto implica se puede tornar muy difícil para ambas partes, ya que significa cortar relaciones con esa persona que alguna vez amaste.\nPor ello, el director y escritor, Noah Baumbach, decide buscar retratar en su cinta \"Historia de un Matrimonio (2019)\" el doloroso proceso de divorcio por el que pasan Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) y Charly (Adam Driver). Una pareja que tiene que buscar la mejor manera para convivir juntos, a fin que su hijo no se vea afectado por los problemas de ellos.\nUna historia que es narrada de excelente forma, ya que permite que como espectadores conozcamos las perspectiva o punto de vista de ambos protagonistas en este problema. Esto, debido a que la cinta nos plantea un desarrollo donde cada personaje tiene su momento para exponer sus aspectos positivos o negativos como persona, a través de sus acciones y diálogos, para que así, podamos empatizar con ellos y elegir o no un bando al cual darle la razón.\nY es que la cinta te sumerge en el mundo de los personajes mostrando muchos detalles de su diario vivir y por ende la perspectiva de cada uno. Con ello, el filme llega a tocar puntos sensibles y emocionales en la audiencia, sin la necesidad de haber vivido una experiencia similar, porque plantea situaciones y problemas que se sienten muy humanos.\nAdemás, la película siempre te deja claro que se trata de una historia que puede suceder en la realidad a cualquier pareja. En este sentido, \"Historia de un Matrimonio\" llega a conmover por la empatía y rasgos humanos que generan los protagonistas a través de sus actores y su puesta en escena.\nYa que, tanto Scarlett Johansson como Adam Driver logran adentrarse en los sentimientos de dolor y pérdida que origina una ruptura matrimonial. Dos actores que son conocidos por sus papeles como la Viuda Negra y Kylo Rem en las populares cintas de Marvel y Star Wars. Pero que en este filme logran conseguir una actuación diferente a la que estamos acostumbrados a verlos.\nAsí mismo, la puesta en escena es buenísima ya que, por ejemplo, la fotografía logra generar el sentimentalismo intenso que manifiesta cada personaje. Esto debido a los encuadres que se realizan en que por momentos enfocan sus rostros y en otras veces pequeños detalles de sus acciones. Y así, poco a poco te llevan de la mano por los motivos, recelos y miedos que sufren sus personajes, resultando así un clímax increíble, pero a la vez angustioso en el que se ven involucrados.\nEn definitiva, \"Historia de un Matrimonio\" se vuelve una reflexión sobre la empatía, explorando desde un punto en el que ya es demasiado tarde. De esta forma la cinta se vuelve un el proceso de los protagonistas en darse cuenta de esta importante lección, ya que la empatía involucra tener en cuenta los sentimientos de los demás o como dicen ponerse en los zapatos de esas personas.\nYa que al final de cuentas las razones que se plantean en ambos personajes durante el filme son bien genuinas y llegan al punto en el que no importa de qué lado estemos porque en realidad no hay un victorioso y nadie puede ganar en este proceso de separación.",

It seems like it is heartfelt and thoughtful, deep, enlightened, warm, complex, philosophical---but after viewing I feel like I've been eating potato chips rather than having a substantial nourishing meal. Clearly he's talented and not stupid. The writing is fine. He has directorial skills. But there's a superficiality and faint whiff of nihilism around him that you won't find in, say, Wes Anderson,  Richard Linklater, Jim Jarmush. And while someone like Scorsese is nihilistic he (a) struggles with that and (b) is unabashed about it. Something about Noah Baumbach's posturing about being humanistic gets up my nose. His work is carefully crafted but, to me, ultimately somewhat hollow--possibly because most of his work is about himself, thinly veiled to be about humanity and the human condition but ultimately his own view of the world and humankind arising directly from his own lived experiences---passed off as insightful, but perhaps just under the surface lurks semi-smug self-preoccupation and narcissism. Rendered---but not created. He's good at what he does. tho. And performances from all the cast are outstanding.",

In it there are disappearances, murders and a lot of violence scenes. \nThis series tell us the story of Anna, who is a single mother who lives with her two teenage children and for different reasons they had to move to Curon, the town where Anna, the mother, grew up. When they arrive to the town everything unfolds in a calm way, but slowly the story becomes more tense and strange things begin to happen. \nIn my opinion, I think it´s a series that you should watch because it uses good actors, that maybe are too recognized, but they perform very well in their role. Another good point is that the town is very emblematic, this means that the cloudy and dark landscapes are attached to a horror story, and the music that it uses is surprising.

            "content": "In short, it's a tiresome and dull look at a crumbling marriage.  Noah Baumbach was extremely lucky by the generous reviews and acclaim he has received from this film. \nFrom a filmmaker's standpoint, this film was many notches below Scenes from a Marriage by Ingmar Bergman or Kramer vs. Kramer. A Marriage Story was too derivative of what we have already seen and there were no exemplary traits that made it stand out from the films that came before it. It was self-indulgent and visionless. When thinking back on the film, there is one scene that comes to mind that stands out but is not distinct. The scene, which is the most talked about, takes place in the very drab apartment where they let out their emotions. This scene felt like a rehearsal or improvised exercise for actors rather than a cinematic, well-written scene where the words make you feel. Rather, it was the actors doing their jobs well, with the wrong dialogue. The writing gives me no reason to feel empathy for them.\nThe apartment was an accurate portrayal of a typical badly designed apartment in LA but the realism of it was uninspiring and bleak. Sure, that could have been the point and probably his intention but is realism and bleakness what we need in cinema? Where are the days when films felt like an escape and not some depressing rollercoaster through a dismal life? It would be one thing if Noah Baumbach wanted insight into these kinds of relationships from a sociological standpoint and was an upbeat positive person (the opposite of the characters), but he is in fact just taking from his own sad experiences that frankly have been done far better and don't deserve this type of attention. \nOverall, there was an unnatural feeling to the whole film that placed oneself in between a film and theater and an audition room. I appreciate some of Noah Baumbach's work but this one was a miss for me, he can do better. Unlike the Meyerowitz stories, the casting was off and although the actors performed well, I didn't believe in their initial reason for being together or their cry-baby emotions that felt contrived. \nMy last question is, who cares about some random couple in LA going through a divorce? There are more important stories to be told that involve realism. Noah Baumbach, stop being so self-absorbed.",

While it is clear from the start that the movie talks about the separation process of a couple, it is trully able to tell their whole marriage story. It tells you how they met, when and why they fell in love, what started to feel wrong at some point and what lead to the break up, all that in a very sutil way (while it feels like just a divorce story is being told, maybe no such story can be told without describing the whole relationship). It does not try to convince you that they might get together and play with your expectation that they will do so at some point, it is mostly interested in \"studying\" the feelings and actions of a divorce. Nicole and Charlie love each other. They do have problems, they do seem confident about their decision of divorcing, they do get too involved in the process but, in the end, they love each other. Right from the very first scenes, the incredibly beautiful descriptions each character makes of the other already shows how much love and care is still there. This is such a rich montage in my view, not only for the beautiful soundtrack and the rythm of images but for how it is able to describe the characters and also show how they view each other. Charlie already seems to be more critic while Nicole almost worships her husband. The movie shows the divorce process in such a raw and real way, making it so clear that there will never be a true winner in this case because they love and care about the family; any result will feel like a loss. Things escalate without intention, what also sometimes seems unavoidable in a situation full of tension and misunderstood feelings. There are several powerful scenes besides the initial montage: the long conversation that turns into a fierce argument (the only one in which feelings are actually showed), Charlie singing Being Alive with an excruciating amount of feeling, Charlie reading a book for his kid lying at the same bed in which Nicole weeps at the side, Charlie and their son reading the initial letter wrote by Nicole. This is a sad, soul-crushing experience but that feels extremely real and shows with precision the complexity of feelings and events surrounding a divorce. I really loved it.",

This movie isn't just a divorce story about two people yelling at each other for the entire movie. It shows you what really goes on during a couple's struggles from both sides. Neither one is the \"bad\" guy and both want what's best for their kid and also each other. It also shows you the legal battles that goes behind a lot of divorces which was really interesting to see. The music was beautiful and it was one of my favorite parts of the movie. Another part that I think is underappreciated is the cinematography. The entire movie looks like a moving photograph. It represents the fact that when you look at one, you remember what happened behind that photograph and the memories begin to start flowing in. It made the movie really feel like it was about the whole family and not just a single person. I also love how they did then ending. It didn't feel depressing or bad at all. In the end you're not mad or angry at one of them, you just hope the best for both of them and that's it. The acting is amazing and I adore everything about this movie. I highly recommend watching it.",

The final result is a very pleasant film, masterfully shot by Baumbach, who has a very delicate and discreet eye. In particular, I appreciated the choice not to give in to the typical patheticism of so many melodramas, which would have made the film unbearable to watch.

Even Charlie, who initially seems to consider it only a temporary separation, does not even mention an intention of reunion, sometime in the future. From either side, there's no hint of will of working out the differences and find a compromise, of exploiting the separation for the good of the couple and the family.\n\nEven though it's easy to relate to both the main characters and share their point of view, Nicole is portrayed in a slightly more negative light. She breaks the promise to do without lawyers, which may not have been such a bad thing had she told Charlie she had changed her mind instead of deploying tricks to get an early upper hand. She even goes as far as to mortgage her mom's house to pay the lawyers. That would be understandable under dire circumstances, but not when your husband is begging you to find a consensual agreement and not throw money out of the window, that could instead be saved for the child's future. He is instead depicted as slightly more responsible, and only resorts to the top-dollar lawyer after having been thoroughly battered and humiliated together with his earlier, more humane lawyer.",

I watched a script to screen clip, and an entire back and forth scene was all written out and it just seems to amazing to get an arguing scene so well written and acted out. You just feel for the characters and there’s not protagonist or antagonist, it’s just a look into the lives of this couple. Literally such a great movie! Now I get why it was nominated for so much, and Laura Dern was really great as Nora the lawyer! Must watch if you have Netflix! Don’t skip this one!",

A loving couple is getting a divorce. It's starts of smoothly, but turns worse as it goes to court and the war is in. Words they don't mean are slung and salty tricks by both lawyers and the couple. Both are going to rough times, not to mention the kid that means the world to both of them. You kind of cheer on one of them, but both individuals share good points.\n\nThis film has a screenplay that are absolutely amazing. It's carried by the performances and the words they utter. The gentle, sweet fun and the sadder fights and self-sorrow is also key to keep this thing together. It's rather long, but not a dull moment here for me.

Worse, the film doesn't present a credible motivation for the characters' situation, nor for any of the decisions the characters make. These problems are there from the opening's misdirection where we are treated to how much the protagonists like each other only to shift, with no explanation, into the current setting where they are, inconsistently, alienated. Then, again for no credible reason, Nicole turns to a divorce lawyer and then both characters turn into unidimensional victims of the writer's screed against divorce lawyers. That leads to an unrealistic set piece of everything turning vicious in the courtroom in a way no judge I know would allow. Another set piece follows when Nicole and Charlie, again incredibly, brutally lash out at each other verbally, only to have things end with a predictably bittersweet conclusion where Nicole and Charlie, apparently reconciled to their separation, exchange sad looks. And then there's the rather bizarre back-to-back scenes where Nicole and Charlie both, rather poorly, take on Sondheim numbers. These scenes come out of nowhere, go nowhere, and contribute nothing at all to the story. I suppose, given how badly the rest of this is written, these songs might have been the writer's lazy attempt to use these songs as a commentary on the characters' inner states. But, just like most of the rest of this, they're just another couple of scenes that fail to work. Disappointing.",

Dern deserves a solo lead Oscar worthy best actress award film next as proven by her Oscar win for best supporting actress. Others might not relate to divorce issue as it differs from audience but Marriage Story deserves an Oscar Best Picture nomimation because what presented in this film is a real-life struggles of living in separation and divorce.

Charlie and Nicole start the story by writing about each other, the things they love about each other when they are in one of the therapist sessions. Nicole declines to share her writings and Charlie was keen on sharing his but Nicole was no longer interested in Charlie or his thoughts. What sounds like a perfect marriage, slowly shows us how the two ends up destroying each other in ways they never thought they could. \nCharlie has always been dependent on his work, his life revolved around his theatre. His choices were based on what he thought would be best, Nicole never had a say and it was getting to a point where she felt she was nothing but worthless as an individual. The writer and the director of the movie have played with emotions, not everything is sad and dull, there is a lot of humor as well. The scene where Nicole wants to serve Charlie with the papers has to be one of the best scenes in the movie, it shows the complete chaos that happens in a family. \nThe couple had agreed to solve everything by themselves and make sure that their son does not feel the wrath of the divorce. But when Nicole moves back to LA, she becomes a totally different person, in her terms she's finally free and can make decisions and choices of her own. Henry, their son slowly loses interest in his father as he enjoys his mother's company more. Charlie does not give up on his son easily, he in fact fights for him till the very end. \nYou get to experience the true bitter nature of both the characters when they involve the lawyers. Nicole's lawyer Nora is well known to get the best possible deals for her clients, while Charlie struggles to find a lawyer at first, he later finds someone who was very lethargic in nature. Charlie eventually hires Jay after he realizes Nicole is ready to destroy him no matter what. \nA scene where Charlie and Nicole go against each other is probably one of the most emotional scenes of the movie as you get to understand how bad they could taint each other. The movie ends with possibly one of the best sequences in which Henry is reading the notes that Nicole had made in the first scene of the movie, Charlie reads it and eventually bursts into tears and Nicole stands behind him equally emotional. Marriage story is indeed a complete circle.",

            "content": "As a child of divorce, this film is a remarkably realistic and visceral depiction of what divorce is truly like. Throughout the film, the viewer witnesses the good intentions of former spouses be ripped apart by the legal process of divorce and replaced with cruelty, apathy, and unequal conditions. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson gave the best performances of their careers. From screaming matches to the small, intimate moments between the former couple, Driver and Johansson provided so much emotional weight for Noah Baumbach to work with. Laura Dern gave an excellent performance as the cutthroat divorce attorney trying to get her client everything she ever wanted, completely overriding any sentiment Nicole may have still had for Charlie. Despite Charlie's deplorable actions during their marriage, the viewer sympathizes his plight as his world is turned upside down and his son is permanently brought to L.A., a testament to Driver's incredible work with the character. While the apartment meeting scene is by far the most emotionally impactful, there were countless scenes in the film where Charlie and Nicole's pain, anguish, and resignation could be palpably felt. Baumbach did a fantastic job getting the best performances out of Driver and Johansson and his subtle camera shifts during purely conversational scenes helped sell the realism of the film. I was thoroughly overjoyed at the ending as in real life, divorce is not merely bitter arguments and loathing one another (at least in some cases). The love was still present between Nicole and Charlie, it just manifests itself through their mutual love of their son - which is how divorce should be. Overall, Marriage Story is an excellent movie and a testament to how impactful realism in the film industry can be.",

Like some movies say that they are realistic because their characters get hurt while doing things, when that thing is fighting a bear or jumping off of a cliff (two things no one I know has done so it doesn't seem that realistic). This movie takes realism seriously. Like that scene where Nicole is talking to Nora and she gets up and walks to the bathroom to get a tissue all while saying her story and that little touch just really added to the experience because it is something that someone would do in real life (get a tissue to blow their nose while crying) yet you would never see it in a movie except for this one.\nI don't think it had an amazing story but I really joined it and definitely think that it is a must watch",

It's kind of funny though, as it's been on my list for a while, and of all days to watch it, I unknowingly picked Valentine's Day.  It wasn't until a friend pointed out the irony that I realized the choice I subconsciously made.  So it's an excellent movie.  The performances are so genuine that it feels so real.  You feel like you know the family and they're your friends.  You feel for them during the tougher times, they melt your heart during the good times, and they make your blood boil during the hostile parts.  It's a rollercoaster ride of emotions.  I absolutely do not agree with Laura Dern winning the Oscar for best supporting actress.  She didn't stand out at all imo, and if anything I though Ray Liotta did a more memorable job that her.  I'm shocked she won the award.  I feel like this movie experience for ppl going through a divorce will be akin to hearing an Adele song.  You feel like the art is made specifically for you... like the art is about your life.  Just like how divorced women felt attached to Eat Love Pray way back when.  It's that kind of movie.  But it's not made just for them... it's made for everybody.  In some way or another, bc of how genuine the viewing experience feels, most ppl will be able relate to the movie.  Lastly, I totally think Scar Jo deserved the Oscar for best actress.  She totally hits it out of the park.  And it's such an \"Oscar\" role too.  I'm a big fan of hers so I was a bit perturbed when she didn't win.  So that's my take for the day... Oscars suck and Marriage Story rocks.  I definitely recommend watching this movie whether you're single, married, going through a break up, or married for > 50 years.  This movie is for everybody.  I'm a horror addict, so if this movie appealed to me, it can appeal to anyone.",

I thought the acting was pretty terrible--Driver's especially. Maybe it's because all I see when I look at him is Kylo Ren or maybe it's because monotonous villainy encompasses the entire spectrum of his acting ability? In any case, that big fight scene where they're yelling back and forth made me laugh because of how ridiculous it was--not believable and not as \"real\" as the movie attempts to portray their relationship. Not to mention Driver looks like he's seriously struggling to make himself cry. It was depressing from start to finish, and Driver's affair made me unable to empathize with him at all; despite Johansson's character flaws, his deception and betrayal were undeserved, and I couldn't see past those aspects once they were brought to light. Dern was the exact same character she played in Big Little Lies, so her performance wasn't impressive in the least. The custody battle was engaging, but Johansson's case didn't seem to hold water for me, which made the drama all the more forced. Since when is it acceptable to move across the country with your child and enroll them in school in a different state during a custody battle? I don't know much about custody law, but I'm pretty sure that's not customary. Lastly, the 2.5-hr run time dragged on for what felt like an eternity. I've seen movies that portray a real-life strained marriage much more effectively that weren't anywhere close to receiving Oscar nominations, so I'm not sure why this one made the cut.",

            "content": "I think the first film I remember crying at was Kramer v Kramer; I don't know how old I was, but I remember being in the same room as it when the TV was showing it one Christmas. I don't think I fully understood it - but I know what stayed with me so powerfully was the way I sensed it articulating something of my own fear of my own parents splitting up. Not that I ever had any reason to think that would happen - it didn't. But I remember the fear. \n\nMany years and 20 years of my own marriage later, Marriage Story doesn't evoke the same fear, but it does evoke both a kind of sadness as to the way it portrays what so many go through, a kind of recognition of the sort of slow escalations that all of us experience in almost any sort of relationship. It's the simple - yet complex - story of a couple's marriage in breakdown ... they start in couple's counselling and ends in divorce, following the negotiation of the details along the way. \n\nIt seems odd to cast the film among the performance industry - he is a theatre director, she an actress; at times that's in danger of tipping the film into the sort of conflicts most of us don't have to deal with, but in the end there's enough truth there to make this feel like an 'everyman' sort of relationship.\n\nThe whole film hints occasionally at the heightened realities of musicals - the framing, the tight close-ups and tracking shots following the long speeches of one or the other, maybe even the colour palette at times suggesting the 1950s/60s musicals golden era. When Adam Driver's character, near the film's end, sings a Sondheim song in a bar, that sense is bought closer to the heart; like musicals, the film is unashamed in trying to move us and does so.\n\nMuch of this is quite remarkable - Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are outstanding, both of them simultaneously sympathetic and repellant, highlighting the reality that the film doesn't force us to choose one side or the other; or if it does, the way we jump is down to our own biased, not the film's. The film's standout moment, an argument that starts amicably and ends in words that can't be unsaid, is the sort of sequence you feel as if you're privy to someone else's private pain, laundry that should only aired in private hung out for all to see. It's remarkable in performance, direction and writing - and everything else besides. \n\nThe film also mines comedy out of some of the most painful situations; the moment Adam Driver's character is served with divorce papers is almost farce-like in its execution, yet the tonal shift within the scene never jars. Much within the film is funny, because people are funny; there's always a hint of joy, even in the midst of great pain. \n\nThis, I think, is where the hope in the film comes from; given where we are almost certain the film will end right from the first scene, the light touches of humour and the moments of clarity amidst the recriminations, claims and counterclaims point us to the human capacity to be better versions of ourselves even when so much seems to be falling around us. Like the best films, it's never one thing entirely - it's a love story about a divorce, a drama with very good jokes and comedic scenes, a musical with only one song. It's a film about one particular relationship, that allows us to see every relationship (not just marital ones)  in a fresh light.",

            "content": "Despite its annoyingly vague title, Marriage Story is actually about a divorce. On one level writer-director Noah Baumbach's latest film feels like a divorce procedural. We follow a young attractive couple (Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver) as they agree to keep things simple and not involve lawyers, then involve lawyers, begin a custody battle, and try to navigate all of the emotional and legal complexities of legally dissolving a marriage. On another level, Marriage Story is a showcase of brilliant performances ranging from subtle to ostentatious, comical to moving. I enjoyed Marriage Story far more than I expected though I hesitate to recommend it since very few people (myself included) are able to have a good time by watching people argue and get divorced for over two hours. The divorce gets rocky but the film doesn't so much and if you are in the right mood for a relationship/divorce drama you'll find a decent, somehow, feel good movie.\n\nThis is the kind of movie that hangs entirely on its performances. Fortunately, the leads and supporting players all turn in strong performances. Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver have both earned Oscar nominations for their performances as the wife and husband seeking to uncouple themselves while remaining involved with their eight-year-old son and maintaining their careers. Both earn and lose and then earn back your sympathy. Charlie (Driver) is a successful New York theater director whose latest avant-garde production is headed to Broadway. Nicole (Johansson) once starred in a popular Hollywood movie but since meeting and marrying Charlie has committed herself to the stage. A Los Angeles native, Nicole has always wanted to spend more time on the West Coast and now has landed a role in a pilot that will likely become a series. Charlie thinks of them as a New York family and expects Nicole and their son to move back to New York once the pilot is done. When Nicole decides to officially file for divorce the real conflict between them begins.\n\nBaumbach's script does not overtly take sides though it leans toward Charlie, especially toward the end of the film. The explosive climatic argument between Nicole and Charlie gives a chance for both actors to express intense emotions, but it is Driver who gets to let out overwhelming pathos. A court appointed observer—played with welcome awkward comic deadpan by Martha Kelly—is assigned to visit and interview both parents, but we only see the visit Charlie. Charlie does his best to present as an ideal father before the visit falls into dark comedy. In a wonderfully delivered monologue early in the film, Nicole gives us her backstory, both life events and emotional. After this scene the perspective shifts to Charlie and never really shifts back to Nicole. We are as blindsided as Charlie is by claims on money and custody by Nicole's lawyer.\n\nNora, Nicole's flashy and smoothly confident high-powered lawyer, is played with impressive ease by Laura Dern, who has earned a Best Supporting Actress nomination. We're just as charmed and dazzled by her as Nicole, and just as stung by her as Charlie. Alan Alda delivers some great low-key comedy as Charlie's first divorce lawyer. He's old enough that his hands shake but also old enough to know how bad a divorce can get, and how it will likely end, so, he recommends just starting there. On the complete opposite end of the spectrum is Ray Liotta as Charlie second divorce lawyer, a high powered and extremely expensive pit-bull. He speaks with such speed and ridiculous intensity that he can't help but be funny and believable as a ruthless lawyer. Julie Hagerty is a welcome presence as Nicole's actress mother. She has so much flighty warmth that she secretly helps Charlie find a divorce lawyer.\n\nI'm sure certain viewers that have been through a divorce or even a bad breakup will find something relatable with the characters and situation in Marriage Story. I wouldn't be surprised if other viewers find these characters and their situation unrelatable. Nicole and Charlie, though not wealthy, are in a very upper middle class bracket. They are so accomplished that momentous life changing events like landing a starring role in a TV show and earning an Emmy nomination for directing (Nicole) and winning a MacArthur \"genius\" grant (Charlie) are just background plot points. Whether you can relate or not, the performances from Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver are of such a rare quality as to keep you invested in their emotional journey.",

            "content": "Before I start this review, I would like to state that I am writing this review the day before the 2020 Oscars. Because of this, I have no idea which of the 8 contestants will win Best Picture. I know that Ford Vs Ferrari doesn't stand a chance, that Jojo Rabbit was probably nominated out of pity, and that Joker is a long shot. Honestly, if it were up to me, none of the nominees would win. Not a single one of my four favorite films of this year were nominated. Dark Waters, Knives Out, Harriet and Avengers: Endgame all missed the boat. However, if I had to choose which one of the actual Oscar nominees would win, I would, without a moment's reflection, choose Marriage Story. The reason this movie is great is because it doesn't actually feel like a movie. Every second of this movie feels like it's actually happening. This is, in part, because of the actors. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson both give perfect performances. Nothing they do feels faked or scripted. There is a scene early on in the movie where Johansson's character has a monologue directed at Laura Dern's character, and it's so well done, it doesn't even feel like a monologue; it feels like a real person, not a character, speaking her mind. Every actor and actress in this movie feels like they are really there, thinking the things they are saying, from the two leads, to the supporting cast (especially Laura Dern), all the way down to seemingly irrelevant featured characters (such as Jazmine Cephas Jones and Martha Kelly's characters). There are several songs performed in the film, and to an outsider, they may seem underperformed or unprofessional. However, that's what makes them work. They aren't being done to wow the audience, they are being done to show that these characters are basically real people, with talents, but also flaws. This is a wonderful film with great performances, great writing and just a general sense of greatness overall.",

And yet, through the gloom and rising anxiety, Baumbach always preserves the heart of the moment, fleshing out the struggle of legal and emotional separation.\n\nThe film stars Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver. Laura Dern, Alan Alda, and Ray Liotta co-star.\n\nJohansson locates surprising areas of honesty for the character, working wonderfully with Baumbach's observant screenplay. Johansson plays an interesting foil, so long in the shadow of her high-profile husband despite being the face of his success in many ways. You can see the pain on her face, but it slowly turns defiant as she discovers a new life and a new (or perhaps rediscovered) sense of self in California. Her performance is Sublime.\n\nDriver has grown into one of the most respected actors of his generation a fearless and magnetic screen presence capable of making you believe everything he's saying no matter the context. He spends much of the film in a bemused haze as their divorce proceedings turn from civil to contentious, unable to understand how things went so sour despite his role in fracturing their relationship. It's the sort of skillful and soulful performance that's expected of him now, and he doesn't disappoint. Their chemistry is undeniable, and their performances sell the emotion of the script with ease.\n\nWhile Driver and Johansson take up most of the space in the room, there's still enough oxygen for some fun and quirky supporting turns, be it Wallace Shawn's unfathomably horny thespian or Merritt Wever and Julie Hagerty as Nicole's sister and mother, respectively. But it's Dern, decked out in slinky, aggressive power dresses and extreme heels, who effortlessly steals the movie away whenever she enters a scene. She has great fun sparring with Liotta and Alan Alda (as a grandfatherly and mostly inept lawyer who may not be up for the job. \"Marriage Story\" is all about its performances, and those performances are flawless in every sense of the term.\n\n\"Marriage Story\" manages to come out on the other side with a sense of calm and understanding, making an extraordinarily difficult viewing experience worth the pain to see how people can keep living even when life is determined to beat all the spirit out of you. The result is a near-perfect piece of transcendent art and one of the true standouts of 2019. 9.5/10",

Here, Noah Baumbach shines in his very human and authentic depiction of two genuinely good - if flawed - people trying to navigate their way through an increasingly turbulent divorce. It seems apparent there's an autobiographical element to the movie: Noah began conceiving the film just a few years after his divorce from actress Jennifer Jason Leigh. According to the director himself, his ex wife likes the film a lot. His compassionate and empathic depiction of Nicole is noteworthy. \n\nMarriage Story feels like it could come straight from Woody Allen's oeuvre. Annie Hall comes closest, I think. But that's probably partly down to switching back and forth between NYC and LA. But watching Noah Baumbach's latest, one is most obviously reminded of Kramer vs Kramer. It's a testament to Marriage Story, then, that after watching it, Kramer vs Kramer feels dated (in fairness, it is forty years old) and Marriage Story feels superior. \n\nThe film vilifies neither Nicole nor Charlie; instead, showing them as victims: victims of an unfair and outdated legal system that cruelly plays both parents off against one another. Insidiously, it strips those fighting for custody of their money, thus creating a desperate situation. The movie illustrates the ensuing escalating tensions through the increasingly unhealthy interaction between the two protagonists, which moves from strained, to quarrelsome, to full-on noxious. But Noah's script is punctuated with humorous and lighthearted moments to balance out the darkest parts.\n\nBoth actors are amazing throughout, and so deserving of the accolades they're receiving. But Driver is phenomenal. He elicits real emotion from the viewer, especially in those scenes with his son, which see him try ever so hard to win over his kid's approval. In one stand-out scene, Charlie grabs the microphone and sings Being Alive. It's incredibly engaging, and revealing, too. In another stand-out scene, he finds the notes of his wife, a list of all his greatest qualities, which she had previously refused to share with him. It's beautifully devastating, and Driver communicates the bittersweetness of this simply and powerfully. It's this scene echoes the movie's vibe: hopeful and redemptive even in despairing times.",

And the performance of Adam Driver was exceptional, once again. The songs at the end were a sweet touch and I found them personally challenging; Is it really better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all? I suspect the filmmaker was just trying to find a positive in his grim situation by claiming, 'well, at least I really lived'. But I'm not so sure going through awful divorces is really what life is all about. Good movie, though it felt like a movie made by 'Hollywood Luvvies' FOR 'Hollywood Luvvies'.

It's also a supremely well-executed artistic experience on a structural, dramatic, thematic, and technical level. It's rare to have a film operate so meticulously in its characterization process, yet remain so fascinating and emotionally impressive. In many other films, you'd label it a potential issue to have your average scene length be somewhere between 7-10 minutes, and to have most of those scenes involve characters simply talking to one another. But these are very carefully constructed moments of build-up, allowing the audience to breathe these characters in and empathize with every action taken and word spoken, no matter how hurtful or diabolical it may seem on the surface. At the end of the proverbial day, we find we're dealing with nuanced human beings trying desperately to navigate their respective ways through a tragic phase of existence (a kind of death, as the movie so aptly puts it). It's sad, heartwarming, brilliant, and earnest -- an experience I know I'll carry with me for some time.",

While it isn't my favorite movie of the year, I'd definitely recommend it.\n\nAs a start, the acting in this was some of the best I've seen in a while, personally, Adam Driver's performance was a huge stand-out. I think Adam Driver did alright in the Star Wars franchise, but this really helps me see him as a really good actor. On the note of great acting, I'd also like to point out Laura Dern's performance as the lawyer, which was also a notably good performance. Another strong component to this movie was the screenplay, Laura Dern's story about reading the script for the first time really sums it up. Baumbach used a great progression to convey the way the characters felt without simply stating it.\n\nOn the other hand, I had a few issues with the movie. I felt that there were certain unresolved threads. For example, this is getting into some light spoilers, the punch in the wall was hardly brought up again. There were a few other things that were never brought up. Another complaint for me would be some of the cuts the movie makes. I also felt that certain comedic bits were misplaced. Other than those complaints, this movie is great.\n\nIn retrospect, this movie is one of the best of 2019. Adam Driver's performance was a stand-out. While I know the Oscar will go to Phoenix for the Joker, I hope Adam Driver gets recognition for his performance in this. The movie's use of emotion kept me invested until the very end. I'd give this a solid 3.75/5",

It's also really well-shot and well-edited. This is one of those rare movies where there really isn't anything bad about it at all. Well, maybe the score is a little weird and distracting sometimes. It's composed by Randy Newman and sounds right out of a Pixar movie. Wallace Shawn of The Incredibles and Toy Story fame is even in it. It seems out-of-place sometimes, but the rest of the movie is so good I think I can overlook it. Overall, this movie is a must-see and I hope it wins some Oscars!",

Scarlet Johansson and really every cast member is fantastic, although it was Adam Driver that outright blew me away. He gave the performance of his entire career thus far, and easily the best performance of 2019 and possibly 2020 (we'll see). Everyone in the film is simply faultless, the actors and actresses disappear and all that is left is real people that you feel you are watching. The story is simple and yet powerful, and the script is a masterful blend of realism and gritty emotion. Throughout this entire experience I felt everything from warmth and laughter, to frustration and sadness. I was simply hypnotized by the film from the start. The casting, performances, plot, cinematography, score, it was all-too immaculate. There were even several moments within this film that almost had me tearing up, and that has almost never happens to me when watching a movie. There is an argument scene within this movie, and wow... All I have to say, wow... I don't know what else to say. Hop on Netflix, turn off your phone, and watch this film. If you don't have Netflix, start a free trial. Just watch this movie.\n10/10",

This film must be considered the best performance of their careers so far and in the future.

Their genuine good intentions for their son mirrored against the clinical and legal battle of divorce that threaten to ruin their future are truly heartbreaking. \n   This film does not have any intention of being anything but true. It does not try to teach you anything or make you question anything. It's intention is simply to make you feel, and it does.

Actress who, in a period of burnout, leaves her L.A. life and moves to New York where she meets, works with, and eventually marries Charlie.\n\nNarration starts the story, where the two characters describe all that they love about each other while we see examples of those words depicted on screen. We then come to find that these \"narrations\" are actually the written words each has been asked to write about each other as they begin the process of divorce.  A beautifully well crafted and concise way of introducing the characters, establishing their love for each other, and why they married without delaying the main focus of the story... the pains of divorce.\n\nCharlie and Nicole wish to end things as peacefully as possible. However, self-interest (or perhaps a bit of self-preservation) for the lives each wish to live beyond marriage interfere with those goals. The process of divorce, particularly when custody of a child is involved, picks at the wounds that led to the divorce, making it easier to forget what people may have once loved about each other.\n\nMost divorces are a result of paths going in different directions, realizations of things that you may not have seen during the infancy of a relationship. Careers, ambition, feelings of self-worth... they all come into play and are depicted as fuel for the gradual demise of their relationship.\n\nNow, enter the many vultures that surround these two looking to divorce. Divorce attorneys that you almost feel have developed their approaches or styles, perhaps based on some bad divorce they, themselves, had gone through. They do not always seem to have their client's best interests in mind. Their aim to score the win for their client simply fans the fires of pain that may already be encircling the soon to be ex-couple.\n\nWithout going further into plot, the biggest success of this film is how each character is a sympathetic character but at the same time, guilty of sins that may have led to current events, signifying there is no ALL Good or ALL bad... no main villain.. but simply two people whose paths intersected at one point, met each other's needs for a time, then ultimately drifted in different directions.\n\nAt the center of all of this is their son, who clearly loves both mother and father, who has some connection issues due to distances between father and son, both geographically and emotionally. But through it all, the son serves as catalyst for the rising contentiousness of the interaction between mother and father as they fight for custody.\nAll told, the story progresses to a moment that showcases some of the best acting I've seen from BOTH actors to date.\n\nI would love to comment on the ending but I hesitate, not because of spoilers, but because I almost feel that the uncertainty of how it ends is part of what gives the ending a satisfying feeling.\n\nNot since Kramer vs Kramer has a film about divorce given such a painfully earnest look at divorce. Fair, yet honest, and, at times, emotionally gut wrenching look into divorce. This movie is a must see.",

I'm not even the product of a married one. Everyone I know who has gotten married or had kids did it before I met them, or stopped hanging out with me almost immediately afterward. Everyone I've ever met who got divorced either did it before I met them, or is someone I stopped hanging out with beforehand. So I don't come to the subject of Marraige Story with a wealth of experience, which means it doesn't exactly scream \"relatable content\" to me. \n\nLet me start where it's easiest and everyone seems to agree: The performances. Everyone in Marriage Story is pretty great, none of the characterisations changed my life, but I get it. As a chance to display what these actors are capable of in a mundane setting where all that matters is their performance, yes, absolutely, Marriage Story has buckets of success. \n\nOutside of this though... I'm not even going to say that it \"fails\" elsewhere, just that it didn't win me. I like bleak movies, I like movies that make me feel something, even if it's sad. But Marriage Story isn't really that. It poses you the question of whether both Charlie and Nicole are good or bad people, and shows you each from their own and other's perspective. The ending seems to imply that they're good, or at the very least both good and bad (and aren't we all?) but that really doesn't matter very much when we just spent all this time watching both of them be horrible. I know that's life, that's real, that's people, and blah bl-blah bl-blah, but that's little consolation when I've just spent two-plus hours of my life being not at all compelled by a bunch of people being awful. Being awful convincingly, to the actors' respective credits, but in this setting that is not my idea of a good time at the movies.",

The whole of \"Marriage Story\" provides great commentary on that as well as marriage as an institution and how the inherent selfishness of humanity ultimately can make such an institution dysfunctional , yet in an odd way by the end of the film, still function on some level.\n As a male viewer, I empathised with Driver's pain and selfishly deluded ways throughout the whole film. \"Marriage Story\" is as effective as a condom for viewers in my demographic when looking at Driver's characters situation and the lengths he goes just to spend time with his son on the surface, but truly gain a sense of control over what he built and now calls his \"life\", that he so desperately wants to live and share with those around him as he so eloquently belts out in tenor at a club towards the end of the film.\n \"Marriage Story\" is a tale of letting go, listening, and honesty and the lengths we as humans will go to keep others around ourselves just to make ourself feel better irregardless of the feelings of the other. \"Marriage Story\" is what happens when introspection, existentialism, neediness, and slavery walk into a bar and have a loud conversation.",

            "content": "Evaluating this movie fairly is difficult for me, because my experience with divorce was much, much uglier than what was depicted in the film (which was already quite ugly). I never felt particularly emotional as I watched it, possibly because my own past was preventing me from doing so.\n\nThat being said, I can not deny that Marriage Story is a true achievement of film making. The courage and self-reflection that Baumbach displayed by telling us the story of his own divorce is remarkable and commendable. Perhaps this is most prevalent in the exquisite screenplay. From the opening scene through the final moments, every line of dialogue feels so cleverly written, yet also completely genuine, as if they are real conversations one might overhear at a coffee shop. The predicaments that the characters find themselves in are heart wrenching, or can become so with a single line that hits the viewer straight in the heart. It tells the story in satisfying ways when needed, and uncomfortable ways when necessary, and these moments transition seamlessly.\n\nThe exceptional script would be a waste without an all-star cast, and this movie had talent to spare. The cast is led by Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson in the lead roles. The chemistry (and intentional lack thereof) between the two is among the strongest and most genuine I have ever seen. Driver excels in his role by bringing realism and likability to a character which the script sometimes depicts as selfish and cold. The audience is convinced that this is an authentic, loving father who struggles to adapt when his world turns upside down. Johansson is excellent as the mother; She delivers as the strong, caring mother when with her son, but below the surface, plays the part of a talented artist being trapped and held back, desperate to \"find a piece of earth that's hers\". \n\nThe ensemble deserves much praise, but the standout is Laura Dern, playing the part of Johannson's divorce attorney. Dern puts on a clinic in \"tactics\", an acting term referring to the methods characters use to get what they want out of others. The way she manipulates her clients is subtle enough to be mistaken as friendliness, but strong enough to be effective. \n\nOn a technical level, the film's technique is misleadingly simple and plain. The editing, production design, and cinematography don't draw any attention to themselves, but dance together to create a seamless flow to the narrative. Much acclaim goes to Randy Newman's score, which is the lifeblood of several key scenes. \n\nAs mentioned, my biggest disappointment in the film was that i wasn't brought anywhere near to tears, though I wanted to be. I suppose that this can be chalked up to my personal horrid experience with divorce. Even though it didn't strike many chords with me, I appreciate the craftsmanship that went into it and look forward to future works by this director.\n\n7/10.",

            "content": "'Marriage Story' is written and directed by Noah Baumbach, depicting the divorce of Charlie and Nicole, and showing the inhumane nature of the judiciary system and how it affects their relationship. This film is well written by Baumbach, with the opening scene taking the audience on an unexpected turn, which keeps us on edge for the rest of the film. In his writing and directing Baumbach shows us the hostile nature of the corporate lawyer's world and the toxic effect it has on Charlie and Nicole's relationship, although they are getting divorced, they are by no means on bad terms. Comedy is also excellently weaved into the movie, and not shot or acted in a way that make it over the top. In Charlie and Nicole's argument scene, some lines didn't feel like they suited the character and situation, which in turn lead to overacting, and one character was dull, for comedic effect, however was so overly dull you couldn't buy into it. The cinematography in this film, done by Robbie Ryan and the editing, done by Jennifer Lame, place a lot of focus on shots of only one actor, which does a great job at showing the characters emotions and bringing the intensity to a scene, however, at times it can become a headache for the audience, cutting to and fro from Charlie and Nicole, where a different shot used could still encapture the same intensity and atmosphere to the scene. This film was excellently acted, with Scarlett Johansson (Nicole) and Adam Driver (Charlie) both playing their roles excellently well, with as mentioned before only one moment in the film being slightly overacted. The acting means we never take one side throughout the film as we empathise with both characters which creates a moral dilemma to those audience as to who to agree with and who not, which brilliantly points out that just because two people are divorcing, it isn't necessarily one person's fault. Overall, this film is well worth watching, a really well directed and acted drama with moments of comedy, with the whole film showcasing perfectly the unnecessary wedge being driven between these characters because of how society perceives divorce should happen.",

That is as real as cinema gets.\n\nOkay first off, I started watching it without knowing anything about the characters, the setting or any other detail. I hadn't even seen the trailer for it. So when I understood both of them, Johansson and Driver respectively, were a stage actor and a director I was a little bit let down because I thought this was a more \"down to earth\" kind of a story and not one of the high life of New York and LA. I was surprised that this factor did not affect the story that much or almost at all.\n\nSo in some short words - the movie is at times lighthearted but is mostly one really riveting and heart wrenching story from start to finish. It starts off pretty light with some warm and even funny moments but when it actually gets going stuff goes down so hard you cannot control yourself and start feeling empathetic towards both the characters no matter who you have chosen to side with for the time being. \n\nThe whole direction, the writing, the actors' work makes it so easy for you to feel the same amount of pain as the person you are seeing onscreen. The movie is truly that powerful. By the time you are done with the movie you will be left with this bittersweet taste in your mouth and the feeling that you went through this whole family ordeal yourself. \n\nBut the thing is that only mentioning Driver's and Johansson's performances dos not simply cut it, it does not give them enough credit. I can see that I have seen them in different roles here and there but together in this is something else entirely. This might be just a bit of an overstatement but for me both of those great actors give a career best performance.\n\nSo in other and a bit simpler words, that's what I think makes the movie one of a kind - a story and a premise so simple and yet one that makes you feel as if you were the person in front of the camera. Just a bit funny and filled with all these bittersweet moments that we all know so well from our own lives, the movie is the most \"real\" flick I have seen in recent memory.",

Basically the mother (Scarlett Jo) ends up having a mid life crises and lies to her husband , kid naps and disrupts her child's life to bring him to LA so she could live out a selfish fantasy instead of being a good mother and sacrificing  her needs for a sense of stability and normalcy  in her kids life. The poor dad gets railroaded (as usual) while the mother acted like she was not going to make a big deal out of the divorce. Overall it was just cringe, and showed how little upper middle class Hollywood types fight for their marriages. It now makes sense why so many ppl in LA have multiple marriages. There was some good acting, but overall it was bland , bounced around genres and you didn't know if it was a comedy or drama.... I'm surprised how this is getting so much attention. But then again most critics can relate to the selfishness and insanity that is  \"A Marriage Story\".",

The scenes with the lawyers , while very funny took away from the serious nature of the film. Lastly, I could not understand why this couple was getting a divorce. They clearly loved each other but their issue were so minor. I was left scratching my head as to why they were not together anymore. I didn't make any sense to me.

Noah Baumbach's talent as a director as well as Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson's incredible acting ability created one of the best argument scenes in cinema history, the 4 minutes long take showing the decline of Adam Driver's characters showed pure emotion and almost heartbreak towards the audience.

I love that Charlie went back to his first attorney, Jay (Ray Liotta), when he decided to neglect Bert's (Alan Alda's) advice to his detriment. The courtroom scene showcases the hyper-combative nature of Family Court that too many experience in their lifetime.

To be fair, it was 4 am and I wasn't feeling the best mentally when I watched it, but still. As a sucker for just about any rom-com, I was cautious of this film simply because I knew it wasn't going to have a happily-ever-after at the end. In spite of that,  I reccomend this particular movie to anyone who needs a good cry or a good think. I stayed up for at least an hour after finishing the movie, just replaying each of the scenes in my head, examining everything, from the physical take to the stunning dialogue between the characters. I think that's what so excellent about this movie; there aren't any \"throw-away\" scenes. Every scene in the movie must be there or it wouldn't tell the same story. Adam Driver talked about this phenomenon in an interview he did on a press tour for the release of Marriage Story. He said that every scene in this movie required his utmost focus and care when performing and he couldn't \"space out\" on any of them or the movie wouldn't be complete. I believe it. This film is rife with metaphor, subtle and not too subtle with the perfect blend of joyous and heart-wrenching moments.\n\nMad props to Adam Driver and ScarJo for their acting in this film (I personally think it's their best work thus far); their on-screen chemistry sold audiences on their deep love and respect for the other, despite their failing marriage. The very nature of the characters in Marriage Story, Charlie and Nicole (director and actress respectively), lend themselves perfectly to Driver and Johansson because of their careers and the industry they belong to: Hollywood. Their careers end up as the ultimate downfall of their relationship, shedding some light on why so many Hollywood marriages seem to end just about as quickly as they started. If I had to choose a favorite scene from the entire film as a whole without spoiling, it would have to be the opening scenes. The beginning scenes for each character (Charlie and Nicole) parallel each other elegantly, while setting up the story that will soon follow. The voice over is reminiscent of 80's teen dramas and I adore it. The cinematography alone will amaze you not to mention the moods that Baumbach can create with just a lingering shot. The emotions you feel will run the gamut of second-hand embarrassment to straight-up rage, all developed through those elements of film. It's a cinematic masterpiece. \n\nAll I can say after this ENTIRE rant about how much I love this movie is please watch it. I couldn't ask for anything more than to give this amazing film 136 minutes of your life. You won't regret it.",

Now that I've wiped my tears away, it's time to discuss Marriage Story.  This is the story of a married couple that is going through a divorce, but not wanting to put the stress on their young son, they try to stick together as a family while going through a long legal process to finalize their divorce. \nThis film was about as perfect as you can get when it comes to telling this type of story, and it's packed with two of the best performances I have ever seen. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are the best they have ever been and have my votes in the upcoming Oscars for best actor and actress respectively. The only one that can rival Driver is Phoenix which I probably will still ever so slightly side with. Having witness my parents go through a divorce, this movie effected me personally on a deep level. By far the biggest strength of this film is in the screenplay and story, how it's not about the arguing, but how it just destroys a family. Mentally, financially, and in other ways its hard to explain. There were a couple of moments in this film where I was just losing it with tears and again that lies in the performances. They are pitch perfect. THE argument scene was some of the best acting I've ever witnessed in my life. Hearing these characters pour out this heartbreaking dialogue just killed me in a way. The music was so simple and so sad at the same time. I cannot stress enough how much I was impressed by the acting in this movie it's truly mesmerizing. So many extremely long takes of dialogue and the dialogue is not only heartbreaking to listen to, seeing these actors not break character while delivering them is the best part. The ending of this film took me back to the beginning of it and had a big what if scenario in my head. That perhaps was the most heartbreaking part about it, and that goes with the writing and the screenplay. So many people have Netflix today and they better not pass on this one. I really can't find a single flaw with this movie, I honestly can't. This movie took me on an emotional journey I won't soon forget, and Marriage Story ABSOLUTELY gets an A+",

The story itself not only taught me a lot of things I didn't know about divorce, but it gave me a deeply personal look into what it's like. The characters in this movie didn't seem like characters, but real people that we were watching the lives of. Everything about the story to the conversations between characters was deeply human and can connect with just about anyone, even if you've never been through a divorce. It made me cry at least twice, and I came close to crying a whole lot. The only few issues I have with it is that the score doesn't really suit my tastes. I don't know what it is, I just don't feel like it suits the movie, and maybe it could've had a better impact with a better score. And despite the amazing performances, there were a few lines in the movie that made me remember I was watching a movie, they felt a bit forced, but I was pulled right back in after a few hiccups.

I certainly learnt something.  Both Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver are at their best, despite a certain lack of personal chemistry, which in the context, oddly, helps.

This view into a divorce of a marriage that felt real and felt believable, a divorce not stemming from abuse or absence but from a loss of purpose. The two actors Adam Driver and Scarlett Johnson are absolutely phenomenal and give you a sense that you are going through this time with them. Their relationship is maintained and feels consistent throughout the film although the obvious tearing of the marriage that binds them. Through the film you learn the hardships of the relationship from both sides the mental toll from the marriage and from the split, the moments where both people messed up and where they succeeded. Comedy plays an important role within the movie not only so the movie doesn't drag your emotions too deep but to show how both characters use it as a median to the bad and good. It proves that a sense of humor is human and a path to get through what you may not think you can. The movie does a wonderful job at providing everything you need to see clearly that neither party is the fault of the marriage but the marriage itself. Both Nichole and Charlie are great parents to their kid Henry and share a love for him that is the same love they have for each other, which plays into the story beautifully. The movie starts and ends with the same thing which is positive and very touching. Both Charlie and Nichole are seen pushed to their breaking point, both cracking open and bouncing back within the film making you feel for them as if they are real. Although I do not have any direct view into the world of a divorce it teaches you how horrible it is but how peaceful it can be afterwards. The ending is redeeming and shows how a divorce can better a relationship rather than destroy it. Wonderful movie, absolutely one of Netflix's best so far and justifies itself for many awards.",

That was the worst acting job I have ever seen, by anyone, ever.  The two \"musical\" numbers should have been cut because they were truly awful.  This movie missed the mark on so many things.  Everything seemed so superficial and the dialogue was overwritten.  This could have been a great movie if it had been told from \"truth\" instead of from a \"they were just so darn nice to each other\" place.  This movie shouldn't have been called \"Marriage Story\" because it didn't really show us anything real about their marriage.  It should have been called \"A Pretty Nice and Civil Divorce Story Between Friends\".   I did think that Adam Driver's acting was excellent and so was Alan Alda's.  I just think the writing needed a lot of work to make it a more intense and believable story.

But after watching this movie, it makes me feel like I have gone through the entire struggling, painful process. There are no dramas throughout the movie, rather, all the stories sounds real, normal and could happen to any married couple that are trying to get divorced.\nTime is always cruel and powerful: It can set apart a couple, who used to love each other deeply and exclusively, and now make them fight against each other, (with the help of each's lawyer) , for money, assets and custody of children. All these changes don't take too long — just in few years. \nIn the movie, Charlie (the husband) and Nicole ( the wife) had a very intensive fight for over 15 minutes, I was impressed by how angry, unsatisfied, nagging they were. Those negative emotion, that had been suppressed and controlled for years had finally exploded and became devastating. They used the most harsh words to hurt each other. The husband even said he wanted the wife to die. Not surprisingly, they finally divorced. But I was very sad about the ending of the story. They could have had a happy family, watching their kid grow up together, but they terminated it because of disputes on chores and small things in lives. Had they communicated their negative emotion timely and thoroughly whenever the issue arose, and weren't leave it accumulated, a divorce can be avoided.\nBut it was too late to say this. Nicole had already started her new life in LA with her boyfriend. A divorce was already a divorce, nothing can get back. \nWhat I've learned is: life won't give you a chance to regret, and move backward. A broken heart will never be healed completely. You have to move on to embrace your new life, And let the past be an unforgettable memory. \nI highly recommend this movie, because it gives you a good chance to rethink about marriage, life and divorce.",

They're great throughout the whole film, but there is a certain scene in this movie that everybody will talk about and it floored me. They way they act towards each other, they have great chemistry. Laura Dern also did a great job, playing a slimeball lawyer who keeps taking Johansson's character into things she doesn't want to do.\nThe real hero of this story however is Noah Baumbach, who also wrote the film and deserves all the praise. He is a true master in writing and directing. He makes all of it seem effortless, with unprecedented results. He could truly be one of the last true story tellers working today.\nOverall, the movie to me is basically flawless. It makes you laugh; it makes you cry; it even makes you feel things you can't identify. It's a heartbreaking story about how two people can love each other, but still know they aren't good for each other.\n5/5",

It's more than that. It's a beautifully written and observed piece about what brings us together, and what remains when our bond grows brittle and shatters. Baumbach's script is a revelation (and a likely Oscar nominee or winner), but so are the powerful performances by Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver, both at their best, whose characters we alternately root for or despise as if we are breaking up with each of them ourselves. That fight scene! That show tune scene! Laura Dern and Alan Alda make the most of well-crafted parts as lawyers, one a shark (Dern, uncomfortably close to her work on \"Big Little Lies\" from 2017-present) and one a confoundingly laissez-faire pushover (Alda) ... or is that wisdom? Do not sleep on the work by Julie Hagerty as a mom who refuses to choose sides and Ray Liotta as a counselor who swims in the same school as Dern's character. If the mounting backlash to the film doesn't damage it, it could sweep the major categories at the Oscars in February. P.S. If you missed Baumbach's \"The Meyerowitz Stories\" (2017), as I did until recently ... it's even better.",

While Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson's characters are really the optimal parents for a child (kind, playful, engaged and involved), the story isn't saccharine or trite. It reminds us what it is to be cast in the most negative light - to be seen at our worst- and then reminds us of the importance of love and why love, even waning love, is never futile. Experiences, even negative ones, can teach us lessons about who we are and what is important.\n\nIf I had any complaint about this film, it would be its chosen scope. While the emotion and arc of the story is universal, it would be nice to see a movie stripped of the privilege of wealth. These are two people who can afford costly lawyers and transcontinental flights every few weeks. The writers and producers lost the opportunity to show how divorce affects those who don't have the money and social standing these characters enjoy. The average salary in the United States is $47,000. It would be interesting for the writers to create a film with the same emotions while the divorcing couple figure out how to live separately within those financial constraints.

I just expected to be blown away, and was not.  It's just not as powerful or as emotionally devastating as I was led to believe.  It's a poignant, true-to-life drama about two utterly believable (if not so sympathetic) characters that more than a fair share of the population will relate to, whether they are willing to admit it or not.  But it did not affect me in the way some other movies with similar subjects have.  A more apt title for this film would have been \"Divorce Story\" – it's more about the grueling legal process of a contentious divorce and custody battle than the marriage that led up to it.  It's often uncomfortable to watch; the emotion it evokes is anger more than empathy, watching what that process can do to two otherwise reasonable people that care about each other.  The movie does a good job of showing both characters' viewpoints and bringing you along on their journeys, so you feel like you are going through it all with them.  Both characters are flawed and are hard to root for, but that was the intent – marriage is messy and divorce is a goddamn disaster, even for the best of people.  The film just didn't make me care much for either of them until I was pretty deep into it, when all the tension that has been subtly building over the course of the film comes to a head in one explosive scene (if you've seen the film, you know the scene I mean… it's a gutter, and Driver and Johannson could not have been more convincing together).  This film is what you call an \"actor's film\" – it's focused on character and heavy on dialogue, (plus some whopper monologues), to the point where it often feels like you're watching a play.  It has all the makings of an Oscar winner:  a celebrated auteur writer/director in Noah Baumbach, two stellar actors at the top of their game, and a resonant drama at its core.  It's the kind of movie that Academy voters eat up with a spoon and it's a shoo-in for Best Picture, Best Actor/Actress, and Best Director nominations, plus a writing nomination thrown in for good measure. The only question is whether or not its affiliation with Netflix will kill its chances for the big prize come Oscar night.",

However, I simply couldn’t bring myself to hate this movie because it is perfectly acted, has moments of levity among the sorrow, and feels so genuinely heart-wrenching in how far the relationship has fallen. We can see, as their divorce draws closer, they still retain some faint echoes of the love they once felt for each other. I’m fairly confident that Noah Baumbach must have written this based on personal experience, because it is too authentic to be entirely fabricated out of nowhere (and at times the film seems to cast the wife in a more negative light than the husband.) Scarlett Johansson brings her A game here, and it’s hard to deny her talent. Yet it’s Adam Driver who impressed me even more, because he delivers a truly astounding performance loaded with nuance and emotion. There are some scenes in Marriage Story where so much is communicated by Driver with only looks and body language. You can feel the hurt hiding behind a casual conversation, and when it explodes, the vitriol is truly shocking. There is no denying that, for those who like a realistic relationship drama, Marriage Story might be one of the best films in years. However, while I tip my hat to the quality of the film (and commend them for making the movie that Blue Valentine wishes it could have been) it’s still a style of story that is a tough sell for me.

Marriage Story should really have been titled Divorce Story because we follow couple Charlie (Adam Driver) a theater director, and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) an actress, who are getting a divorce. They have agreed to not use lawyers and to settle this just between themselves. They have a son named Henry (Azhy Robertson), so of course that complicates matters. Nicole lands a pilot in Los Angeles, so she decides to take Henry and move in with her mom temporarily. While in Los Angeles someone tell she should get a lawyer for the divorce, so that she doesn't get screwed over. Nicole hires Nora Fanshaw (Laura Dern) who specializes in divorce. Suddenly, Charlie is thrown into this and has to scramble to get his own lawyer. The rest of the film portrays the hard decisions of divorce and how two people that still may love each other slowly start to unravel and change. It's some pretty deep stuff here and I would say it's a great movie, but not a film I'd watch more than once because of the somewhat depressing subject matter. The two leads performances in Driver and Johansson are great here. They have some scenes together that are so realistic that it's hard to believe this was all scripted. You feel for both of their sides and I personally couldn't side with either or during it all. It's a heartbreaking film and I have my own opinions of the ending and what could be happening here, but I won't spoil it all. This is an incredibly well acted movie, but also not exactly pick me up kind of film. Definitely, recommend checking it out though on Netflix!",

This should be seen  If you need to hit the pause button go ahead. If it hits too close to home it will be cathartic.  If you don't like this film you probably don't like movies.  Wife summed things up thusly:  \" It was a difficult movie to watch which perhaps has confused me into not believing what a good film this was. I can't find fault in it, but maybe because it was so emotionally close to home for me, I could appreciate the superiority of the reality of the story. Adam Driver and Scarlett Jo gave convincing performances that felt far too familiar. A coworker warned me that it would be a difficult movie to view and not to watch it. Maybe it wasn't the worst idea to sit down and give it a chance after all because now that I have sat with it, I've grown in appreciation for the performance, score and attention to detail.\"  Frankly this movie stays with you long after you have digested it.  It makes you uncomfortable and your rooting interest may change mid-swing.  It's one of the best films of 2019 (no matter what wife says!  Wife: 8.4/Hubby: 9.8 Average Score: 9.1/10",

With divorce plaguing 50% of couples, the movie really captured the love, resentment, hardship, and confusion of the situation.   \n\nThe reason I just can't give this movie more stars is because it's insanely depressing.  I don't watch TV or Movies very often, so if I do spend my time watching something, I want it to be worth it.   For me, this movie was not.  The fact that it's relatable is not a compliment unfortunately.   If you wanted to talk someone out of getting married, all you would need to do is show them this movie.   I kept waiting for Charlie and Nicole to get caught in a moment of lust at least once.  I was left dissatisfied by the lack of the intimacy despite the chemistry that was built up between them.   The movie is called \"Marriage Story,\" but it's nothing of the sort.  It starts off with Charlie and Nicole reading over a list of things they love about each other only to find out it was an assignment from their mediator.  This is not a story of Marriage.  It's a story of divorce, heartbreak, and grief.   I don't know about you, but I have enough of that in my life.  Movies are supposed to be an escape from reality, not a reminder.    When Charlie finally gets to read Nicole's list, the emotion is so real and raw, you'd think the ending would have been more satisfying, but nope...  It's just as depressing as the entire movie.   \n\nSorry Adam Driver...I still think you're great!",

I did wish that they would've had more 50/50 time split between the two leads. It felt like at the beginning of the movie it leaned more towards Scarlett, but for the rest of the movie you were seeing more of Driver's perspective.

            "content": "MARRIAGE STORY by Armen Pandola\n\nNetflix's Marriage Story, written and directed by Noah Baumback (The Meyerowitz Stories) and starring Scarlett Johansson as Nicole and Adam Driver as Charlie, tells the story of the divorce of two young artists at the beginning of their careers. She is a young actress known for a topless scene in her last movie (this is according to the people in this movie) and he is an avant garde theater director and head of his own company in New York City.  When they meet by chance, they fall in love and she moves to NYC where she becomes the 'draw' for his theater company. Eventually, they have a son. At the beginning of the movie, they are getting a divorce after 10 years and are seeing a mediator in the hope of having a  friendly divorce.\n\nIs it a spoiler to tell you that a friendly divorce is rarer than a vegetarian meal at Mar-a-Lago? I knew a couple who mediated their divorce and everything was going well until they got to the jazz album collection (this was back in the day) which they were to split evenly. He objected - she didn't know Dizzy Gillespie from Dizzy Dean when I met her. She countered - yes, he introduced me to jazz but I was the one who actually bought and cared for our collection of over a 1000 albums - if it were up to him, he'd still be using his albums as coasters at the drunken parties he and his friends threw every week. And so much for mediation.\n\nThe upshot of Marriage Story is that good people get divorced and often do terrible things, things they'd never dream of doing except for the divorce. And that's what happens to Nicole and Charlie. The contested divorce legal process is unfair and incredibly expensive. Laura Dern is Nicole's lawyer and she explains to Nicole that she cannot admit to any wrong-doing or even any flaws since our world treats women/wives/mothers so differently than men/husbands/fathers. Women/wives/mothers must be like Mary, mother of Christ and a virgin to boot. Men are like Joseph - who is absent when the going gets tough and isn't even the actual father who is away somewhere doing whatever it is that gods do.\n\nThe other side is represented by Ray Liotta who tells Charlie that he had better get ready to be demonized and pay legal bills and costs that would make a lottery winner cringe. At first, Charlie is represented by a nice lawyer played by Alan Alda who tells him, \"We have to prepare to go to court hoping we don't go to court.\" When Charlie sees that Dern is crushing Alda at a meeting, he switches to Liotta who can talk faster and be meaner than anybody else.\n\nAlong the way, there's a custody dispute. At the very beginning of the divorce, Nicole goes to LA to do a TV pilot (her first acting job outside her husband's company in a decade)  and takes their son with her. The expectation is that she will return to NYC when the pilot is completed but then - she doesn't. Her family is in LA where she grew up and made a career as an actress. The money is exponentially better than doing theatre work. So, Charlie can only see his son by traveling cross country on weekends.  As is usual in divorces where there are children,  the child becomes the center of the divorce with each side claiming that it knows best for the child. Of course, the divorce is devastating to children, but that is a different movie and Baumbach concentrates on the adults.\n\nIt gets complicated quickly. The heart of the story is told in long takes where both Johansson and Driver communicate their rage at what is happening to them and the man/woman they loved. These longs takes show both Johansson and Driver's acting chops - each of them is able to build a scene to the point where real emotions are on display. The hateful argument  they have at the end of the divorce process is contrasted with the tender affection for both their partner's qualities and deficiencies that they talk about at the beginning of the process. In fact, it is probably true to say that if you can find a person who loves not only your wit and charm, but your surliness and bad habits, then you should chase him/her until you catch him/her because that is the person who loves you.\n\nTwo songs from Sondheim's Company are sung - \"You Could Drive a Person Crazy\" by Nicole and her actress mother and actress sister, played beautifully by the under-appreciated Julie Haggerty and Merritt Wever, and \"Being Alive\" from the same musical sung by Driver. Each song speaks to what their characters are feeling about each other. Strangely, in Company, there is even a more appropriate song they could have sung - The Little Things You Do Together:\n\n\nIt's the little things you share together,\nSwear together,\nWear together,\nThat make perfect relationships.\nThe concerts you enjoy together,\nNeighbors you annoy together,\nChildren you destroy together,\nThat keep marriage intact.\n\nIt's not talk of God and the decade ahead that\nAllows you to get through the worst.\nIt's \"I do\" and \"you don't\" and \"nobody said that\"\nAnd \"who brought the subject up first?\"\nIt's the little things,\nThe little things, the little things, the little things.\n\nThere is so much to recommend this movie that I hesitate to mention a few missteps. While money is mentioned, often, it isn't really talked about in substance. The fact is that many people never recover, financially, from a divorce. This is partially solved in the movie by a gift from the gods that drops in their lap during the divorce. A bigger problem is that Baumbach wants it both ways - the great angry scenes where people say things to each other that they don't mean, but once said can never be unsaid, and the happy ending. One of the best angry arguments that Nicole and Charlie have is negated by their embrace at its end. The fact is that arguments drive people further apart and don't end in an embrace but, usually, a slammed door.  There are some maudlin scenes whose purpose is to show that they have moved on with their lives and are doing fine, and still think of each other with love and affection. And a divorce that ends that way is rarer than a 2-for-1 meal at Mar-a-Lago.",

The film is loaded with great supporting cast (Alan Alda, Ray Liotta, Laura Dern are especially memorable) and the march towards the inevitable conclusion feels both agonizing and satisfying altogether. Driver shows depth and dimension as the controlling Charlie and Johansson buble up energy and apathy as the awakened Nicole.  It's interesting to see how 2 actors who in real life portray the divorcing pair - Johansson, a very public figure on marriage #3 and Driver a very private figure still on marriage #1. At times Charlie seems shell shocked by the whole process while Nicole can transition between wresting the couple's child from her husband while at the same time lovingly cutting his hair.

            "content": "Wow. What a great story about relationships and the beginnings and endings of them. Marriage Story is a flawless, heartbreaking story led by two of some of the best performances of the year. Adam Driver is phenomenal. Most people know him from the new Star Wars Trilogy but people should really see some of his other films. He usually does a great job but in this film, he is 100% dedicated to the role. They are certain scenes in the film where it doesn't feel like he is acting. It feels as if he is actually this character and going through all of these troubles. He puts so much emotion into his performance that it is heartbreaking yet mesmerizing. Scarlett Johansson gives yet again another fantastic performance. While her performance isn't as mesmerizing as Driver's performance, it's still perfect. She also conveys a huge amount of emotion with her role but adds a slightly more comedic and relaxed atmosphere to Driver's serious and hardworking atmosphere. Both actors play off each other perfectly, even in scenes where their characters are fighting with each other. Every other performance in the film is pretty great, especially from Laura Dern. The script for Marriage Story is fantastic. It compliments the performances and feels very natural. It knows how much the characters need to say to get a point across or when to restrict them. The music and cinematography are great. The music is done by Randy Newman (Toy Story) and fits the depressing tone the film is going for. The film makes the good choice of not using music during certain dramatic scenes which helps make those scenes more emotional. The cinematography isn't groundbreaking by any means but there are a lot of beautiful shots. Towards the beginning of the movie, there is a 5 minute uncut shot of Scarlett Johansson talking about why she stopped being in love with Adam Driver's character and it's great. There is one sequence in the film that is perfectly shot, acted, and scripted and it's the argument scene. I felt sad and a smidge emotional for the characters throughout the film but this one scene made me feel a whole lot. It's one of the best scenes in cinema this year. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson completely disappear in this scene. It doesn't feel like acting. It feels like the filmmakers just filmed real people breaking apart. The emotion displayed in this one scene is off the charts. It cemented for me that Adam Driver is a masterclass actor that people should pay more attention to besides being known as \"the guy from Star Wars\". The rest of the film has its emotional moments but they don't top that scene. The film's plot is pretty straightforward but the way the characters interact makes the film feel unpredictable. Noah Baumbach used his direction to make a straightforward story feel unique. I'm going to start paying more attention to Baumbach from here on out. Overall, Marriage Story is a fantastic film about relationships and divorce with some of the best performances of the year, an outstanding screenplay, unique direction, and some great cinematography and music.",

Scenes shine where actors are given the time and language to build and gather momentum -- Driver and Scarjo; Dern and Liotta. While the middle clunks along with back and forths to and from NY-LA and Driver's incessant search for a lawyer, the authentic performances and attention to detail carry the film. While the writer/director lived his research, the personal doesn't get in the way of cinematic storytelling, instead, fuels it. Much of the magic here comes through nuance -- a juxtaposition of frames, a silent act of generosity, even a look. With dashes of much needed comedy, Marriage Story avoids the trappings of melodrama and sentimentality and is the kind of small intimate story we rarely get these days -- too often passed over by producers and audiences alike. Without a \"happy ending\" or a winning party, much less a clear battle between good and evil, instead, Marriage Story is a cross section of 2 lives, and a worthy contribution to the cinematic relationship canon.",

From your (ex) partner telling you different things than they're telling their attorney, to the attorneys taking extreme positions to maximize billing through the protracted meeting of the minds, to the emotional cost, the financial cost...the portrayal of the system is accurate, insightful, and visceral. \n\nAlmost everyone becomes rewarded for selfishness. Attorneys get to bill more at ungodly rates for very basic work, and the parties are rewarded for only thinking of themselves in a zero sum game. Who loses? Well, everyone...but that loss becomes part of the process as well. The mental anguish becomes a sacrifice for the attorney fees/increased time, couples look back with bitterness, and children suffer from the cross fire. \n\nI'm not sure if it was therapeutic to see it's not just me, and to have something I could relate to so deeply...but this should definitely be seen as a very accurate warning sign for couples separating. I suspect that it was exorcism of a few demons for the writer/director as well. \n\nThe acting is uniformly excellent, and it was especially nice seeing Allan Alda as the voice of reason that is completely useless in a process of the damned. \n\nOn the negative side, the film's last half hour dragged, and it could have used heavy editing.

This divorce pushes them to their limits and changes them, but while this is affecting them they're also trying to provide a happy environment for their son.  In about August, this became my most anticipated film of the year.  I just love Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver proved to be great with his Oscar nomination for BlacKkKlansman.  Also I discovered Noah Baumbach last year with his film While We're Young which I think is very underrated.  He's had a few Oscar nominations and is just a great screenwriter and director.  Before Marriage Story my favorite of his was the slice of life Frances Ha.  This film affected me on so many levels emotionally.  I don't know how one could possibly watch this without shedding at least one tear.  It's so incredibly real and it's just amazing how it all played out.  Scarlett Johansson has her best performance once again.  I feel like every time she's in a film she just gets better and better.

I don't know how one could possibly watch this without shedding at least one tear.  It's so incredibly real and it's just amazing how it all played out.  Scarlett Johansson has her best performance once again.  I feel like every time she's in a film she just gets better and better.  The hardest part about this film is that it shows both sides and you can switch back and forth between who you like more and who you like less.  But also you don't want them to split up.  Noah Baumbach did great with this because it's a frustrating film.  It engages you into the characters and story so much that you start to feel so much anger and frustration and happiness and comedy.  The tone has literally everything and blends it great.  Back to the comedy, this film has some pretty funny moments that helped with the depressing tone.  Marriage Story just made me depressed, especially the very end, and it still lingered after I watched it.  The very end just crushed me but it was also the best scene in the whole film.  Just everything blends so nicely in this.  Randy Newman's score is one of my favorites of the year.  It's so joyful and sad at the same time.  Listening to it before seeing the film I was confused how it would work with the story, because there are times where it sounded just so animated.  It just worked perfectly.  I also liked the aspect ratio choice of 1.66:1 because it felt more like a home movie.  To me 1.33:1 and 1.66:1 work nice for a home movie feel.  Everything was just so realistic in this and I didn't want it to end.  This has become my fourth favorite film of the year so far.  Also it's one of those films where I don't want to rewatch it too much so it surprises me every time with how great it is.  I do that with my favorite films.  Marriage Story is a film that should be recognized as one of the best of the decade.  It demonstrates peak storytelling, superb acting, and shows that Noah Baumbach is one of the best directors out there.  I really think it would be cool if it won best picture, screenplay, and acting.  There are so many words I have for this and I want to talk about it for a while.  I think I'll leave it like this so you can experience it for yourself.  Marriage Story is another perfect movie of the year.\n\nMy Grade: A+",

            "content": "Noah Baumbach's indie divorce drama Marriage Story (2019) is a heartfelt retrospective on his failed marriage to Jennifer Jason Leigh. As awful as the divorce proceedings get, Marriage Story succeeds in entertaining and resonating as it's not a vitriolic or hateful movie. Baumbach's writing is reflective and fair to my perspective. He establishes how genuine and loving their relationship started with touching letters of positive aspects, then delves into what made with marriage fizzle out, and finally assigns blame to both parties. Noah Baumbach's Marriage Story is a resounding triumph of goodwill and heartbreak through an empathetic lens. He understands the pain and perspective of each of his leads making for realistic and honest writing. Noah has crafted a fine art film about marriage, divorce, and love in one of 2019's best movies: Marriage Story.\n\nScarlett Johansson is poignant as Nicole Barber, who felt held back and unappreciated in her marriage. Johansson gives her leading lady a striking voice of adoring wife, decent mother, talented actress, fun partner, vindictive divorcee, and resentful spouse. It's a complicated role that ensures you empathize with her disconnected experience and sympathize with her hurt pride and concerned persona. I appreciate her hurt eyes and nuanced faces. She says so much with subtle changes in expression and tearful monologues. She is intimate in this role like I have not seen Scarlett since Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation. Considering Scarlett's best acting is in Lost in Translation, Her, and now Marriage Story, she should continue to delve into the emotionally devastating world of divorce. At least, I hope Scarlett Johansson acts in more serious dramas like Marriage Story!\n\nAdam Driver delivers a masterful dramatic leading man role in Marriage Story as Charlie Barber. He is fascinating as a doting father, dedicated director, passionate artist, fun guy, and neglectful husband. Driver's finest acting is here in Marriage Story. I loved him in Silence and BlacKKKlansman, but Marriage Story is nuanced like few actors could ever hope to achieve. His shocked expressions are very understated. The way he puts his hand to his mouth to cover up his pain or his sudden outrage at his spouse displeasure is inspired. His quiet depiction of suffering is as riveting as his burst of frustration when he and Scarlett scream at each other in a phenomenally entertaining scene. He sings a sullen song in a depressing scene, but his refined performance equals Scarlett's all encompassing role. Adam Driver is a character actor with range as exemplified in Marriage Story with good humor, kind affection, gentle manner, dejected anguish, indignant disgust, rage filled fury, and defeated nonchalance. He displays Charlie's heart openly for all the world to feel.\n\nI adore Laura Dern's viper divorce lawyer Nora Fanshaw going for everything. Dern demonstrates a phenomenal irreverence for the pain of others as a cold hearted woman beaten down by divorce herself, gunning for every last cent on behalf of her client. Dern is delightful to watch as she destroys a man's life with a determined glee. Her ruthless attitude would work for a mafia boss as well as it does in Marriage Story as an L.A. divorce lawyer.\nLikewise, Ray Liotta brings cunning and sharpness to his brutally honest divorce lawyer Jay Marotta. He is the ideal verbal and legal duellist for Laura Dern. Their courtroom banter is like watching fire spit upon fire in hellish combat. It's one of Marriage Story's best sequences. I love Ray Liotta in Marriage Story as you are on edge in eager anticipation of his next argument.\n\nOn the other hand, Alan Alda gives a funny supporting role as a fatalist divorce lawyer already counting Charlie out named Bert Spitz. His dry wit is amusing, but his hopeless attitude is the saddest aspect to his intriguing character. Wallace Shawn even has a funny cameo in Marriage Story as the inappropriate veteran actor. I liked Azhy Robertson's performance as the young boy Henry Barber, who goes from indecisive to spoiled and back to affectionate all within a single scene. Julie Hagerty is hilarious as Scarlett's valley girl mom Sandra. I dearly enjoyed Merritt Wever's cameo as Scarlett's sister Cassie. Her anxious dread at having to serve Charlie is too relatable and hilarious.\n\nAlongside Baumbach's empathetic lens as writer, his direction for Marriage Story is fantastic. He captivates you by telling each side of the story openly and in intimate spaces. Noah Baumbach's indie direction is simple and sleek so as to allow his cast to perform as if on a stage. His open and free style is earnest with stark images of hatred, loathing, disappointment, shock, betrayal, and affection alike. Noah Baumbach's indie direction feels more like you are watching a documentary of this divorce rather than a film. Marriage Story is akin to awkwardly sitting in a room with divorce proceedings occurring.\n\nJennifer Lame's editing is very pretty and smooth as she seamlessly shifts scenes from Charlie to Nicole with effortless cuts that keep you engaged. Marriage Story is nearly two and a half hours, yet it only feels like one due to Lame's gentle hand.\n\nAll of cinematographer Robbie Ryan's close-up shots of hurt faces and crying eyes made my own eyes cry tears. Marriage Story is deeply affecting and wholly engrossing as you absorb all the adoration and resentment of these characters. Many medium shots reveal all the awkward body language and unspoken feelings in impressively executed long takes. Baumbach and Ryan fasten your focus purely on the emotional distress caused in each scene with unwavering camerawork.\n\nRandy Newman's score is beautiful with soft strings and melancholic classical to underline the sorrowful tone of Marriage Story. His music is nice to hear and never oversteps his boundaries to distract from the story, performances, or direction. Newman composes subtle melodies that chime in only when necessary like a warm blanket appearing when you need it.\n\nFinally, I'm sure Marriage Story will prevail at The Oscars, deservedly so, for its powerful performances, personal writing, and grounded direction. Noah Baumbach opens his heart to ensure that Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver can depict complex, flawed characters that feel like real people. Marriage Story is sure to become a classic piece of Americana.",

In every scene, I only saw Scarlett Johansson, Adam Driver, and Laura Dern, not Nicole, Charlie, and Nora. This movie was boring and self-serving. It might have translated better as a stage play. If you want to see a poignant film about marital cracks, and the festering subtleties that lead to divorce, skip this bland snoozefest and go see the Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams film Blue Valentine from 2010 instead.

            "content": "Noah Baumbach's \"Marriage Story\" is a witty, tender and heartbreaking divorce drama that is propelled by a pair of powerful performances from Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson. With his latest feature, writer/director Noah Baumbach has crafted a powerful portrait of a couple going through a painstaking divorce. In spite of the serious subject matter, the film is by turns funny and heartbreaking. Baumbach's screenplay is excellent and captures the process of divorce in a piercingly honest and authentic way. Filled with compelling characters, witty dialogue and realistic situations, the script elevates the movie to another level. Aside from excelling behind the camera, Baumbach draws excellent performances from his cast. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are incredible in the lead roles, creating a fractured relationship that is utterly believable. Driver delivers his finest performance to date as Charlie. Intense, charismatic and emotionally resonant, he proves that he is one of the finest actors working today. Johansson, on the other hand, is award-worthy in one of her first dramatic roles. With emotional expressions, she captures the frustrations of a women that is dissatisfied with her relationship. Both actors carry the film firmly on their shoulders. Although \"Marriage Story\" offers heartwarming entertainment, ultimately it is not a film without flaws. If I had a minor issue with the movie, it would be the lengthy running-time. At over two hours, it is slightly long and could have been tighter in length. Nevertheless, fans of dramas will definitely enjoy \"Marriage Story\" and so will anyone that has ever gone through a divorce. It offers a heartfelt portrayal of a divorce that is sure to be remembered come awards season.",

Scar Jo is not her most attractive in this film and looks short and dumpy next to the other tall characters. Her haircut is hideous. True to form, her acting is always great, if you can stand this depressing script. I have no idea why Adam Driver is even an actor, he is not even remotely cute and I can't stand to watch him. His best scene was when he was writhing on the kitchen floor after accidentally stabbing himself with a knife.  Back to British murder mysteries for me! Had to watch two episodes of one after this dragging monotonous people next door hating each other for no reason kind of movie. Outstanding performances from both Laura Dern as the glamorous tough-as-nails LA divorce attorney and Ray Liotta as her arch nemesis. They needed more, as in MUCH MORE screen time. What a disappointment. Especially give that in this world so many people actually have huge problems in their marriage and no choice but to divorce. These people actually had a decent marriage, no abuse, minimal problems, but because of their own peevishness decided to ruin a young boy's childhood. Stupid and no lesson learned. Some people actually divorce due to unsolvable problems of a greater magnitude. This movie is slow, boring and a huge waste of 2 hours of my Friday night. Please get Scar Jo another film role immediately so she can recover from this sad mess.  Adam Driver's \"Let me show you my singing voice because I went to Julliard in real life\" performance was Meh. As in very, very average. WHy was that in there? Just to show the difference between NY theatre people (they get up and sing in restaurants) and film people in LA? They say that in divorce only the lawyers win, and even with the performances in this dull little film, that is accurate. P.S. Rotten Tomatoes just asked HOW I bought my ticket and indicated my review might not be considered real if I didn't BUY a ticket to this movie. NETFLIX!  I watched it on NETFLIX, with my subscription. They need to add that as an option. It was December 13, and I watched it on NETFLIX. Thank you, Rotten Tomatoes! If this review is not published I will contact you personally to complain. I do spend a lot of money at actual theatres, but I also spend a great deal of time at home.",

Both leads excel at their craft no matter if they share the same scenes or if they're isolated from one another; their chemistry could not be better, I think. What really assists in their performances is a well written screenplay (perhaps the best one of 2019). Baumbach's personal touch in the writing is present throughout, and the leads honour it very well. On a slight note, some people expecting a tear jerker may get exactly what they're looking for; others may not. I was personally more moved by the sheer acting and delivery rather than the arcs themselves. With its final scene, MARRIAGE STORY does well in showing that although going through a divorce can be a rather nasty business, people can still put aside the past and learn to live in a bittersweet harmony.

The cinematography - from the panning scenes to the scene angles (notably at the start and especially conversations) were executed sublimely. And the raw dialogue- that classic Baumbach brilliance, shines through; leaving me in awe of its realism and constant self reminder how every scene was set with an intention/message. \n\nI must give Johannson her due credit- the stunning raw scenes(her therapist session and heavy-handed interactions with Adam) would not have been possible without her superb craft, proving to younger audiences she is much more than just a one dimensional hot black widow. \n\nAdam who stuck with Noah through his best works: Meyerowitz Stories & While We're Young, albeit as supporting casts is finally given a lead role and does not disappoint. His reticence synergises well with his role, creating fair contrast to Johannson's role which lends realism with its semblance to archetypes of modern day relationships.\n\nAs a young evergreen man, the depth of development we follow the 2 characters through their emotional journey sheds much needed perspectives into the faintly covered theme of divorce.",

            "content": "Something of a modern-day Kramer vs. Kramer, but with all the personality and identity required to make it it's own thing, Marriage Story's power and poignancy rests largely on the acting talents of its 2 leads, who give arguably their best screen performances to date. Both are fraught and frequently on edge, but they both do a lot to convince you that the separating couple once had immense love and respect for one another, especially with the opening sequences which is brought back beautifully towards the end. It tells the story from both sides, and shows just how ugly a divorce can become, especially when a child is caught in the middle and doesn't fully understand what is happening. It also addresses the problems that both men and women, especially the former, face in obtaining custody, and the struggle a parent will go through for that right. Its informed by reality and keenly observes the mundane moments of court battles with wit and humour and the more contentious moments with sympathy and understanding. Noah Baumbach is a forced to be reckoned with in the movie world, with this and The Meyerowitz Stories demonstrating his prowess both behind the camera and the typewriter. Marriage Story shows how a separation can be both devastating and revelatory, how it can tear 2 people apart, but allow you to see things in the other person that you didn't before. It's mostly a showcase for its 2 actors, but everything it brings to the table make it a film worth seeing.",

            "content": "Until the Golden Globe nominations were announced I hadn’t even heard of Marriage Story. But, there it was: Best Actor Drama, Best Actress Drama, Best Supporting Actress, Best Drama, Best Screenplay and Best Original Score. Good grief! I haven’t exactly been hiding under a rock when it comes to movies! Fully chagrined I clicked on Netflix and settled in, fully expecting to be overwhelmingly impressed. I wasn’t but that’s not an indictment by any means. The film was really good just not over the top Bravo! The storyline is actually quite common, one many of us have lived: marriage adrift, divorce, child custody, division of property….“let’s keep this fair and civil, do what’s best for the kids.” If we’re lucky, amicable works. If not, our lives grind to a brutal, angry halt while attorneys screw everything up and money rolls downhill so their kids can relax about college tuition while our kids start applying for financial aid. Watching Marriage Story is like sitting through 136 minutes of bad lawyer jokes springing to life. The horror. Charlie (Adam Driver), a director of cutting-edge, avant-garde theater, positioned to take his latest work to Broadway, is married to Nicole (Scarlett Johansson), an actress fading from NYC stage renown but still popular in Hollywood. The couple have grown apart, recognizing, despite deeply caring for each other, the point of departure has arrived. Divorce is discussed. Their young son Henry (Azhy Robertson) is the beloved prize and both parents start out determined his interests be top priority. Then a wrinkle emerges. Nicole accepts a career revival offer to film a pilot in Los Angeles. She takes Henry with her to California, moving in with her Charlie-adoring mom (Julie Hagerty). On one of Charlie’s frequent coast-to-coast trips to spend time with his family, Nicole bullies her reluctant Charlie-adoring sister Cassie (Merritt Wever) to serve him with divorce papers, smuggled under a pecan pie, then hires Nora Fanshaw (Larua Dern) as her attorney, a bulldog lawyer who approaches divorce in a “there will be blood” crusade. Nora relishes in threatening Charlie with loss of all earthly possessions and any hint of custody. Charlie is forced to retaliate. Enter divorce Death Star Jay Marotta (Ray Liotta). At this point we strap in for a gut-wrenching saga of two legal vipers squaring off to pound the other side to pulp, not caring a whit that “sides” are flesh and blood people, parents at a starting line of good intentions. Charlie and Nicole recoil, shatterIng under scathing legal posturing and purposeful courtroom annihilation. Even Henry is a won/lost tally at times, the wretched center flag of a parental tug-of-war, Charlie pulling one arm, Nicole the other. Everyone is expendable as collateral damage, Charlie literally bleeding out on his rented California apartment floor in one grueling black humor kitchen scene. Lord, have mercy. What materializes below the waves of the legal hurricane are two decent people, Charlie and Nicole, trying—mostly futilely—but trying nevertheless to resist succumbing to emotional cruelty. Predictably, tirades of fury and fear simmer, seethe and eventually explode. Human combustion. As the vitriol flies, you regret on their behalf what they’re unleashing— hateful, damning words that can never be taken back, that will echo forever no matter how hard they may wish differently. We’ve all been there. The film taps our jagged relational regrets, remorse and repentance, making “I’m sorry,” a communal mantra of misery. You want to jump up and shout at the screen, “Stop! Don’t say it! Just stop, please.” Adam Driver is not a favorite of mine, he’s so Keanu Reeves with a distinctive monotone delivery, but he did stretch his dramatic persona for this role, perhaps his best performance to date. Petty question #1: how did 6’2” Driver gets cast with 5’3” Scarlett Johansson? He towered over her. Maybe it was to serve as a visual metaphor for their professional director/actress relationship. Truthfully, Johansson failed to win me over, I never warmed up to Nicole. I was rooting for Charlie, put off by Nicole and annoyed by Henry. Petty question #2: isn’t Henry way too big for a car seat? Cassie, Nicole’s witty sister, was my favorite of all the characters. For the record I am a total Merritt Wever groupie, my enthusiasm for her in Nurse Jackie morphed to sheer hero worship in Netflix’s Godless, the last scene I can watch over and over and over until I’m the last person awake in the household. There were enough funny exchanges in this film, comedy infusion, that thankfully lightened the heavy laden angst. While the attorneys square off, family members rise and fall in their humanness. It’s like taking a selfie of our worst selves against a background of laughter, kindness, and thoughtfulness. If the goal is to showcase the competing dualism of the human spirit then Marriage Story charges ahead of the 2019 drama pack. It didn’t win my vote but maybe because it hit too close to home, taking me on a walk down memory lane of my own awful, demolition derby divorce, fomented by two condescending attorneys who pitted us against each other in a hostile custody battle over our two young sons. 35 years later I still hate the shameful things I said or did. Marriage Story’s “Join the crowd” is small comfort. I’ll leave it at that. The 77th Golden Globe Awards will be held aired live January 5, 2020 by NBC, 8 EST/5 PST.",

A courtroom battle of lawyers talking for their clients, instead of the clients talking to each other. It shows that communication- real, honest communication is the key to any relationship succeeding. The actors were all top notch, most notably Driver, who gives the performance of the year, and maybe this decade.

            "content": "MARRIAGE STORY-2019(R)-Nov. 29. By:Clem The Movie Guy. Thanksgiving weekend, I got a chance to see an exclusive screening of Marriage Story, the new film from acclaimed writer & director Noah Baumbach. Loosely inspired by Baumbach’s own personal experience & further informed by conversations with friends & lawyers, Marriage Story is an intensely compelling & a realistic look at a married couple going through the turmoil of divorce. Once madly in love with each other, Charlie (Adam Driver), a gifted New York theatre director & Nicole (Scarlett Johansson), a former teen Hollywood film actress who now only performs in his off-Broadway plays, are having trouble with their marriage. Charlie is intensely & somewhat selfishly focused on his work. Nicole has grown tired of living in the shadow of Charlie’s aspirations as Charlie grows increasingly obvious to Nicole’s hopes & dreams. After receiving the offer of a starring role in a television pilot & with the divorce in early stages, Nicole leaves the theatre company & moves to Los Angeles with their young son, Henry (Azhy Robertson) while Charlie remains in New York to see to the process of his play going to Broadway. Later, arriving for a visit in Los Angeles to see Nicole & Henry, Charlie is stunned when he is served with divorce papers, believing that he & Nicole had agreed on an amicably split & to forego using lawyers. Nicole has been persuaded to hire a powerful attorney, Nora Fanshaw (Laura Dern), which inevitably forces Charlie to follow suit. Initially he hires Bert Spitz (Alan Alda), a retired family lawyer who favors a more civil & conciliatory approach but as the contention grows, Charlie must resort to a more aggressive lawyer, Jay Marotta (Ray Liotta). Marriage Story shows not only the difficulties of compromise & self-sacrifice in marriage, further complicated by trying to protect any children involved, but the legal system at its worst with ruthless lawyers manipulating their vulnerable clients. The performances from Adam Driver & Scarlett Johansson were raw & captivating. I believe that Adam Driver gives one of the best performances of his career. I won’t be surprised to see Marriage Story receiving major award consideration for Best Picture, Noah Baumbach for Best Director & Best Screenplay, Adam Driver for Best Actor, & Scarlett Johansson for Best Actress. Marriage Story is a MUST-SEE FILM that is now streaming on Netflix. It will be high on my list of Best Films of 2019.",

Something that should hung up in an art gallery and admired.\nThe movie is a compassionate yet incisive look at a family growing apart as well as staying together, told through the divorce of Charlie and Nicole Barber and their son Henry.\n\nThe acting is out of this world. I love Joaquin Phoenix's performance in 'Joker' but Adam Driver has now dethroned him. The emotional range he has is incredible. Scarlett Johansson gives her all. She sells the pain and suffering she is going through.\nThe argument scene is jaw-dropping fantastic. The two viciously fighting with their words made me freeze in my chair out of terror and awe. If the two either don't get an Oscar nod or win in their respective categories, I'm gonna riot. The supporting cast is also great. Laura Dern, Alan Alda and Ray Liotta deliever excellent performances as the Barber's lawyers. Azhy Robertson as Charlie and Nicole's son Henry is tremendous.\n\nThe writing is amazing. Feeling realistic and grounded, it's undramatic approach to the subject matter of divorce felt refreshing. The dialogue spoken between characters was at times wickedly funny and other times devastating. \nThe movie also never took sides. It was never biased or one-sided. Both Charlie and Nicole had pros and cons that counteracted each other, leading to a nice, neutral middle ground.\n\nThe cinematography made the movie feel alive. It brought you into this world, and besides the writing and acting, kept you engaged. There wasn't a single frame where I looked away.\n\nEmotional and raw, 'Marriage Story' is a masterpiece in every sense of the word as well as the best film of 2019.",

The supporting cast for this film is also really good, Laura Dern and Ray Liotta was a combination I never knew I wanted but that one scene shared together was comedy gold. Wallace Shaw isn't in the film that much, but he contrasts very nicely with Adam Driver's strict sense of direction and purpose, he's just a care-free old man. Julie Haggetry plays the sweet ignorant mother very well, her daughter's marriage is basically over, but she still clings onto this hope that they'll get back together.\n\nOverall as I've already said, one of the best movies of the year watch it asap, it isn't exactly hard to find seeing as how it is on Netflix, but if you can see it in theaters I'd recommend that, a lot of people have said that it's a great way to experience the film.",

First, it portrays equally both sides of the divorce, which you don't see too often; both husband and wife are treated sympathetically with all of their strengths and faults. It also digs into its messiness and how all of the things that didn't work in the marriage come to the surface in unexpected ways. The screenplay is amazing. Adam Driver (Charlie) and Scarlett Johansson (Nicole) give the very best performances of their careers and probably the best portrayals ever of divorce. Every scene they are in is powerful. There is one scene during which the two of them get into an argument that is of such intense emotional power that one wonders from where they channel that kind of energy and rage. Laura Dern is exceptional as Nicole's compassionate yet self-interested lawyer; my prediction is that she will walk away with the Best Actress Awards for this performance. Driver and Johansson deserve all of the acclaim they are getting for the film. The film gets a huge thumbs up from me and is among my favorites of the year.

With the best screenplay of 2019, as well as one the best directions, this is the closest the world is ever going to get to a realistic depiction of a divorce. Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver also give the best performances of their lives, elevating every single scene, dialogue, argument, or joke. The long takes allow them to shine and actually work as actors, moving around the set and doing domestic/job tasks, while delivering their lines. Technically, both Baumbach and the entire cast are absolutely perfect. It's an extremely emotional narrative, very depressing, sad, and even uncomfortable at times, which might scare some people off, especially if they've been through this. Despite its replay value being affected (a rewatch is very unlikely), it's a phenomenal lesson in storytelling that stays with us long after it's finished. Easily, one of the best movies of 2019. Don't miss it, and try not to cry.\"",

            "content": "Marriage Story is a near faultless piece of cinema. If you grade films on their writing and acting and directing alone then this film succeeds in all of those areas without any doubt. The latest film by Noah Baumbach continues his rich tradition of pinpoint accuracy in the stakes of the human heart. He has an innate ability to write dialogue that is honesty writ large. And thankfully he employs incredibly talented actors to deliver his words. This film is probably his most serious and heavy to date. There are moments of light humour but this a piece of passion that wears its heart on its sleeve. It's the story of Charlie and Nicole and their son Henry. They work successfully in the New York theatre scene and seemingly have a happy marriage. But the marriage is at breaking point after years of quite disintegration and disinterest. When Nicole flies back home to Los Angeles and files for divorce the film sets in motion the protracted dissolve of their love. We see the minutiae of divorce proceedings in excruciating detail. Adam Driver and Scarlet Johansson have never been better with Driver in particular staking a claim for the finest actor of his generation. Driver is incredidbly adept at delivering emotions on a grandiose scale. The supporting cast is outstanding as well, especially Alan Alda who brings a warm humanity to the film. The writing feels so natural through out. Scenes flow, its editing is perfect, with ease and honesty. There are scenes that are heart breaking to watch, but it's all totally worth it for the emotional pay off. Aided by a subtle score by the great Randy Newman, this film rocked me hard.",

            "content": "I've been trying to come up with a way of reviewing this film in a way that doesn't seem like I personally directed it or something, because movies like Marriage Story don't come along very often and I just feel like gushing about how incredible is. Netflix has been releasing tons of quality content this year and this may very well be the best of their entire catalogue of feature films. Alone with Roma and their recent release of The Irishman, I believe you'll be seeing Marriage Story in contention for many, many awards in the coming months. Here's why I believe Marriage Story is a must-watch. \n\nNot all relationships work out and if every single Romance film ever made had a happy ending, then that would just be a lie. It's nice to see a movie tackle this subject matter and stick with it from start to finish. Marriage Story is a look into the lives of Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) as they are clearly not able to keep a working marriage, but also don't want to ruin the family they have made. From gut-wrenching scenes of excessively honest dialogue and a conclusion that feels raw and true, this movie is one of the best dramas I've seen in years. \n\nTake your pick at who outshines who here, because it really is a toss-up as to who is more incredible between Driver and Johansson. It does help that writer/director Noah Baumbach gave them outstandingly good dialogue to work with, but the way these two play off each other is as if they were given a year to prepare for these roles and get to know each other. Everything about this film felt authentic, which made the overall impact so powerful. It's not easy to watch a movie about a love story that's about how marriage sometimes doesn't work out, but this movie does it in such a way that it doesn't feel depressing throughout the majority of the duration. This is all thanks to Noah Baumbach though. \n\nFrom Greenberg to While We're Young, Baumbach has been a director I've been keeping my eyes on, as I believe he has gotten better with each of his films, for the most part. It wasn't until The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected) that I really started to anticipate his next movie, but now I'll be desperately awaiting to get another story from him. His talent as a director, especially on Marriage Story, is truly something else. He is best suited for movies like Marriage Story or While We're Young, where it's all about the characters because he very clearly has a knack at getting the best possible performances out of his cast. \n\nMarriage Story begins strong, easing you into what will be a very emotional film and concludes in a way that feels natural. Overall, from these award-worthy performances, superb writing and directing, a very minimal score, which lets you sit with these characters for extended periods of time, it's very hard to nitpick this movie. There is one scene that made me chuckle, purely because I felt uncomfortable, but this movie is otherwise perfectly done. By the time 2019 ends, I feel that I may have to say this is the best movie of the year. I absolutely loved every minute of this movie. I can't recommend it enough.",

            "content": "Marriage Story \n \n❤️❤️❤️❤️💔Plot: Charlie (Adam Driver – Star Wars2015, Silence 2016 and BlacKkKlansman, 2018) is a successful theatre director, and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson, Avengers 2012, Under the Skin 2013 and Lucy 2014) a once successful actress have separated and have begun divorce proceedings. Over a timespan inferred as a couple of years Marriage Story plots the emotional strain of a breakup. It depicts the couple's efforts to part amicably while living at opposite ends of the USA. Nicole attempts to reignite her L.A screen career while Charlie's successful stage play moves to Broadway. Both are seemingly geographically set in their ways and by extension their personal sense of who they are as people and as ‘artists'. Circumstances accelerate to the point where involving lawyers seems like the obvious escalation. As thin tolerances give way and frays taking its toll on both parties; unassuming interactions are amplified and held to scrutiny under the microscope of divorce law – and emotions boil over. Caught in the middle of there is their child, Henry.\n\n\n\nReview and Analysis: At first glance this is not a film that would typically draw you in, its subject matter of middle class failed love. It is not a rom-com but there is comedy. There is drama but not forced. \n\nThe film employs a tenacious set-up and false start that immediately asserts these two characters' story into your viewing curiosity. The film's narrative in this respect is very shrewd in its portrait of a once in love couple. It does this through the motivations and self-interests of the central characters. Both Nicole and Charlie's stories are told with a considerable amount of heart, you warm to both of them. You empathise with them and you may recognise a trait in their current emotional entanglement- the complexities of a simple discourse.  They are friends with separate desires and ambitions.  Quirks and idiocentricties, often admirable in redeeming qualities and overtly flawed in their application. They're people, possibly like you. \n\nCaptured within Marriage Story's script, the film allows for breathing space as characters development within the central conflict. They are not forced onto you either in any sanctimonious manner. Quite the opposite. Tightly detailed in structure it never feels constricting for performance. This is further reinforced in the naturalistic settings; opting for a bold realism in the drama – it is strangely high-key lit film for the most part. It feels modern, in keeping with a certain social morality and expected forms of adult behaviour.  Instead of reclining on tropes which often a film of this nature might fall back on.  But instead honest and smart. There is sense of dry wit that underpins, sometimes out of awkward circumstances (Halloween pumpkins) but also provides subtle set-up for much darker punchlines. Sometimes played out in the direction of external relations of the characters, notable in the pragmatic conceit of divorce law when juxtaposed with the couples' wounds. \n\nThis interplay of the characters predicament is surmised in the line of dialogue that divorce law is about showing ‘good people at their worst'. This is one of the film's main inquires, giving the film its depth. It is not necessarily about relationships per say, you never suspect that the characters never stopped loving each other, but rather it casts assertions on the legal practice of divorce proceeding. Divorce is messy despite initial good intentions; conducted with a level of callous manipulation through a veil of identification (hugs). At its best divorce is a selfish preservation of the self: whatever that was or might be, or wants to be. At its worst institutionally exploitative.  All the while, ironically, divorce is what is best for the child, (Henry). Custody, ultimately, is shown to be another weapon in the divorce arsenal– despite good intentions of preservation. \n\nThe audience witness both Charlie's and Nicole's emotional personalities, as people, as well as their legal identities – what they become in the eyes of the court; morphing them into gross caricature that they themselves don't recognize. In this respect the directions aims to walk a line of objectivity between Charlie and Nicole. Marriage Story attempts to provide a neutral stance and in part succeeds, never really wanting to take sides. The films narration will often switch attention between the two asking the audience to witness both sides of the story while inferring what the other may or may not have done. We are told that a child is never a reliable mediator. Though at times Nicole's screen time maybe limited in the second act of the film, she still has a presence on the story. You never sense a protagonist antagonist in the their relationship, the film reminds balanced in its character study.\n\nJohansson and Driver are allowed to act and get to grips with their character, and both supply some stand out moments of range that gives us a certain intimacy, allowing the audiences to get to know these characters' vulnerabilities, but still retaining an objective distance in choice of shot design and blocking. For example: early in the narrative, Nicole meets her lawyer for the first time, Johansson really excels within the observing frame.\n\nMarriage Story rarely cuts as the camera works to record rather than a forced construction of the film's own preconceived notions of who these people are, it is secondary to the performances. The camera is kept at a distance often opting for wides and medium long shots allowing performance within a locked-off camera. For example a characters may walk out of the shot into another room, they may hold in a long or walk into a close up. At choice moments the edit selects signals the cut as means of separation. When the camera provokes meaning it is done for duality and emotional similarities they share. This is also reflected in the tempo of the edit. The eventual court case the camera mirrors both pairs, Nicole with her lawyer and likewise Charlie with his within their respected two shots, the lead characters are still keep at distance through the cut. And we may infer meaning when the camera cuts away to profile head shots. What is particularly clever about this moment is the direction of Laura Dern and Ray Liotta, their lawyers. Throughout the film lawyers are viewed as an extension of the lead characters, an avatar for the central motivations. They can easily embrace their clients with empathy, turn on the bluster when it matters but just as easily turn it off to ask for their sandwich orders. They know the tricks and how to manipulate the perceptions when ‘in the courts'. When the edit eventually does cut to a different angle away from the back and forth mirroring it is to show us the judge who has been insofar absent, he is at the back of the room in a big wide. Thus, he has not been significant in the action nor the bigger picture of the film's inquiry. In the respect Marriage Story successfully provides an absurdist comment of the legal identities that contrast with a very real human persona. A well applied narrative contradiction throughout the storytelling. As such we are being asked to judge the etiquette of divorce rather than infer a verdict of the central characters. Who, for all intended purposes, set out to split amicably? Furthermore, since we have been given an objective portrait in prior narrative events it is somewhat difficult to pass a judgement – the judge himself cannot –should you? It is in this sequence that film also shows a level of self-awareness and what the film will be heavily criticized for. The judge concludes for the sake of the ‘people who don't have the resources your clients have'. It is in this keen self-awareness of the practices divorce the attempts to probe. Both Charlie and Nicole's world's, other than their divorce, is reasonable stable. Both are successful. Both have a support network. Both have a sense of their creative identity. They world is comfortable. The audiences who see themselves, perhaps those 30 somethings who found a level of success, who grew up and found themselves in a new phase of their life will prise Marriage Story because of a recognizable ego. For this reason Marriage Story is of the now, modern, with modern sensibilities. And for the same reason the film will be criticized: why should we care about this white middle class couples, what is their real struggle? Both camps missing the subtext that the film is subtlety satirising the very people who purport the mean spirted trivialities of divorce and divorce law. This is not to say it is honest. It is. This is not to say the film is mean spirited. It isn't- but rather walks a fine line of tragedy and comedy allowing for a textual inquiry. Indeed, Marriage Story cares a great deal about its character, but rather the pain of what they represent. This can be best observed in the finals stages of act 3. Charlie and Nicole argue, it is emotion full of passion. Driver and Johansson work off of each with flowing intense nuance within intelligent blocking. What really helps to signify their emotional state is the Mise en Scene, it a bare L.A apartment. They are at their emotional peak, annulled. Empty.\n\nFinally Marriage Story makes comments on gender representation drawing a comparison between a toxic masculine identity of the past, which Laura Dern's character alludes to, and the characterization of Charlie. There is an obvious contrast. But still there is a level of expectation of gender roles when seeking custody, which divorce can capitalise on. The expectation of which gender is supposedly best for custody has changed though the perceptions of court ideals has only shifted the goal posts and stereotype still prevails. Perhaps again showing a level of self – awareness knowing a likely comparison to that of Kramer vs Kramer (1979). A film which very much trends the same beats but without the modernity. The drama of Marriage Story simmers, you may expect it to turn to the hatred and abuse of Revolutionary Road (2008)with its take on gender. However, Charlie and Nicole's relationship is balanced and the film often treats them with warmth. Nor does it draw attention to itself in form in the same manner as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004). It is modest and unassuming\n\nMarriage Story is executed with powerful performances that provide well-developed characters. The film is very smart with a considerable amount of maturity and thought in narrative cinema engaging you in its story and ideas.  Though the film is bitter sweet in its final treatment of these ideas. On the surface it confirms to hegemonic norms, returning to the simplicity of the amicable rather than giving solutions to the systems it attempts to examine.  And though the time-span may have been taxing for the Charlie and Nicole they will move on; nonetheless, Marriage Story provides an endearing bookend to their love. Though a question reminds – what struggles were truly endured when ‘people who don't have the resources' may not have such a positive outcome. And for this reason, given the need for representation rightly so, how Marriage Story will be revived during awards season reminds to seen – the demise of a white somewhat wealthy couple doesn't seem enough to give pause, despite Driver and Johansson at their very best.

Superbly acted, the film depicts the inner turmoil of soon to be divorcees who have to come to terms with the failure of their marriage. The fight scene is what really settles all their arguments away from cutthroat lawyers or the justice system, it is a very intense scene that showcases the talents of both actors with an incredible chemistry.  Noah Baumach is a very humble director who never disappoints.  A must see!",

They do have a son (Azhy Robertson), which can only add further complications.  Now because this has been getting such high acclaim, I made it a priority to watch it day one when it became available on streaming.  I frankly have never been a fan of what I have seen from director Noah Baumbach, so I will be honest and say that I didn't have all that high of expectations of this.  All that aside, I will be damned if he didn't put together one of my very favorite moves of the year.  Now, where I usually run into problems with Baumbach is that his movies typically feature highly unlikable characters, like with Greenberg or Frances Ha.  For me, it makes it so the narrative becomes utterly inaccessible, and you could make that argument here as well, but there is one thing that I feel is this movie's saving grace: the opening 8 minutes.  It grabs you and doesn't let you go, and you fall in love with this family.  You see how good it can be, and it made me put my full investment in this story.  Everything about this rings true and authentic, and much like an actual divorce, things can get ugly as tensions mount.  Even though my stomach was in knots for almost the entire movie, there is a fortuitous strength this movie features prominently: you understand both sides.  I honestly kept going back and forth on whose corner I was in, which speaks volumes to how rounded and fully realized these characters are.  Something clearly broke in their relationship, and you are rooting for them to be able to recover, but understand if that isn't something that is in the cards.  Every single conversation in this feels genuine to the point that it makes you wonder how detailed the script is; this just feels like two people having real-life conversations, which only sucks you deeper into the film.  This is a raw and emotionally charged film, and I don't know if everybody out there is going to be able to handle it.  For me, I fell in love with it, and I didn't even feel like I was watching a movie for most of this, I got that lost in this story.  I can see this getting three acting nominations easy; Johansson and Driver are expectedly great, but I also really loved Laura Dern as Johansson's lawyer, and it wouldn't surprise me in the slightest to see her getting a supporting nod.  I watched this by myself, and I feel like if you watch this with your significant other, this will be a big-time conversation starter.  You're not going to need to start filing divorce papers, mind you, but you will want to do better in understanding the other's point of view, which is never a bad thing.",

When she gets an offer to work in LA, it makes their impending separation much more stressful. There's more focus on the husband, perhaps because his situation is more disruptive or because writer/director Noah Baumbach based this on his own experience. As a result, Driver is given the bulk of the heavy lifting and his character's dilemma (and his performance) is absolutely heart breaking. Johansson also does a fine job, along with a wonderful supporting cast, esp. Laura Dern and Alan Alda. It's good that they both play their attorneys, because the legal angles tend to drag down the emotional development. As their young son, Azhy Robertson is exceptionally natural. The film is slightly longer than it needed to be, but the subtle, excellent performances and Baumbach's skilled observations combine to create an affecting examination of the pains of divorce.",

            "content": "Essentially a remake of a superior film made 40 years earlier, Kramer vs. Kramer (1979), this movie is a decent enough exploration of a divorce and it's impact on a family in a contemporary setting. The performances are very good but the screenplay has the feel of a play and that leaves you with many monologues that feel overwritten and unrealistic when they should seem honest and authentic. For me there was just something missing as while I love Noah Baumbach as a director and I have found his previous work to be fantastic this was a disappointment as it was simply acceptable when it could have been a masterpiece.\n\nActress Nicole, Scarlett Johansson, is disgruntled with her husband Charlie Barber, Adam Driver, due to his affair with Mary Ann, Brooke Bloom, and his devotion to his own career as a theatre director. She feels that she has been forced to discard her own ambitions as an actress to support him while he lives in New York City despite her wanting to move to Los Angeles where she had grown up. The couple go through counseling but this is unsuccessful and they will be separated as she has accepted a role in a television pilot and he intends to continue directing the play that she had starred in with a new actress. She serves him with divorce papers shortly after he arrives in Los Angeles to visit her and their son Henry, Azhy Robertson. They each take on aggressive lawyers in the form of Nora Fanshaw, Laura Dern, for Nicole and Jay Marotta, Ray Liotta, for Barber after the more gentle Bert Spitz, Alan Alda, fails to negotiate successfully. Both become depressed as they are lonely without their partners and struggle to understand how they could have once loved each other.\n\nInitially I was pleasantly surprised at the fact that we were seeing the separation from Nicole's perspective as I had assumed that with Baumbach being male he would value Barber over his wife. This later proved to be true as the last three quarters of the film are largely devoted to seeing the effect that Barber not being around his son has on him while his shortcomings such as him having had an affair are brushed under the rug. One of the things that made Kramer vs. Kramer so great is that while Joanna abandons her child and son we understand that she is doing this so that her son does not have to be around her when she is going through a mental breakdown and wants to be a better mother by first fulfilling herself. Many of Nicole's concerns are articulated here but there is the feeling that she is being selfish by wanting to be in Los Angeles and the finality of their lopsided custody agreement do ask the audience to see her as the unreasonable one.\n\nThe aforementioned monologues also frustrated me as while I could appreciate the fact that people often pour out their emotions and simply can't stop speaking I was always very aware that I was watching people deliver something that had been written. In particular a discussion that Nicole has with lawyer Fanshaw in which she explains the issues in her relationship with her husband was hard for me to digest as an honest articulation of her pain as there was an artificiality to the writing and to Johansson's performance in this scene that took me out of it. Baumbach also doesn't provide supporting characters as strong as those in other divorce based films as Nicole's 64 year old actress mother Sandra, Julie Hagerty, felt like a caricature. In comparison Margaret Phelps, Jane Alexander, served as a legitimate foil to Ted in Kramer vs. Kramer and displayed his development into a mature, loving father.\n\nAt the end of the day the performances are of a high quality as Johansson is provided with her best role since Lost in Translation (2003) and is convincing as a frustrated woman. She is particularly effective in scenes when she silently displays her discomfort with the conduct of her lawyer or the inadvertently hurtful comments made by her husband. Driver gets a lot more to do and is expectedly very good as a man hit with accusations that he had no knowledge of and is very convincing as a man whose anger slowly builds up as time passes and nothing changes for him. The scene in which he final breaks down and tells Johansson that he hopes she dies was a little too much for me but I can see why it needed to be in the film. Other touches added to the film such as Driver's big musical performance simply made me cringe but both get moments to shine and will most likely receive awards recognition.",

It's like if peeling an onion caused you to laugh instead of cry, but still activated your tear ducts.\n\nHoly frickin' lovely. \n\nThis film is a love story about divorce. Charlie (Adam Driver), who is a well-known theatre Director about to take his play to Broadway, and Nicole, (Scarlett Johansson) who has become a well-known actress due to starring in Charlie's plays, meet in this industry and marry living a life together with their son Henry. Ten years into their marriage, Charlie and Nicole decide to divorce amicably without lawyers until Nicole hires a lawyer  unannounced and things start to become worse than initially intended.\n\nDIRECTION:\nNoah Baumbach (not to be confused with Johan Sebastian Bach) did a spectacular job taking a sad subject and showing such purity and grace. The movie is so grounded causing it to feel like two real people who truly love each other going through this tough time. Baumbach also creates a theatrical feel to the film. He does this by having long drawn-out scenes coupled with beautiful dialogue usually only between only 2-3 characters at once.\n\nWRITING:\nI have to double down with what I said under \"DIRECTION.\" The writing is so pure and real, that it feels like you are truly watching the emotional nature of divorce. You truly feel like you're watching a documentary on two people struggling to balance their secretive resentment and love for each other. I always say that my favorite films are those that can keep me engaged strictly through dialogue and this is a perfect example. \n\nACTING:\nAdam Driver me to the Oscars to watch you receive this reward. Oh my goodness and gracious. There's a specific performance in a scene between Mr. Driver and Ms. Johansson that I think could easily by itself deliver an Oscar for both of them. This is also coming off a great performance in \"The Report\" (Adam Driver) and an amazing supporting role in Jojo Rabbit (Scarlett Johansson). Not to mention the superb supporting cast with the likes of Laura Dern, Ray Liotta and Alan Alda. This incredible ensemble really takes the film to another realm of realism and beauty.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nMarriage Story does what it is set out to do and that is make you feel. Through the Direction, Writing and Acting, this film doesn't make you pick sides or dread so much the process of what can be a very dreadful process. Although the story at it's core is sad, this is also one of the funniest movies of the year and it makes me feel like I'm going through a painful divorce with the same feelings that both Charlie and Nicole feel. I still need to see Uncut Gems, Richard Jewell, Little Women, etc., but as of right now this takes the #1 spot in my top 10 in 2019.",

            "content": "While some have somewhat correctly said that this film covers ground that's been addressed before and that it occasionally tends to play like both a therapy session and a legal consult, writer-director Noah Baumbach's latest nevertheless offers viewers an engaging mix of heartache and humor, showing the pain and utter absurdity that goes into the dissolution of a marriage. The truly superb ensemble cast, with excellent performances by Scarlett Johansson, Adam Driver, Ray Liotta, Julie Hagerty, Alan Alda and, especially, Laura Dern, coupled with a razor-sharp script, makes for a dynamite combination that reaches out, grabs and holds audience attention from beginning to end. Arguably Baumbach's best film, this offering is more than deserving of all the praise that it has rightfully had heaped upon it. You'll laugh, you might cry and you'll definitely feel the heart strings tugged with this one, but the picture assuredly earns the reactions it evokes. Go see it in the theater or catch it on Netflix.",

In Marriage Story.\n\nMarriage Story\n\nThe writer and director, Noah Baumbach is spewing love. Not the usual way of expressing. But then, miscommunication is a major factor in this film. He is sugar-coating or bitter-coating a love story, by deconstructing, reverse-engineering a love story. Although that is what it seems at first. The film, above all, wonder me the most, is when it balances both sides of the coin. Every now and then, I think about what happened, why we are here, just as those characters do. It all makes sense and nothing fits despite the description, the definition. And still you don't feel cheated. And Noah dodged that bullet so effortlessly that you- at certain points in the film, even when there is no particularly emotional hurdle to cross- melt with a cathartic smile and tears, in its simple wittiness. The film deliberately follows Adam Driver's perspective. Now, that is a perfect choice, considering he \"is walking on\" something that he doesn't fully understand, just like us, the audience. Hence, he comes off warm and even pitiful at times, more than he actually might be or should. For following Scarlett Johanson would have come off calculative rather than spontaneous. Not something that the film wants to put out. It is vulnerable phenomena to be in. And to experience it, you should be out of control. Desperation is what drives the greed. And greed, something you keep it off the table from Day 1, is what it will come to. Not materialistic but philosophical. You'd want to be how you think of yourself to be. And in these scenarios where you are highly conscious of your decisions and acts. Legacy (Henry, in their case) is what you hold on to or at least fight for, now that you are sober.",

            "content": "Esto También Es.- En una sociedad terriblemente parcializada donde los códigos de conductas fueron escritos pensando solo en blanco y negro, resulta exquisitamente placentero que alg ún escritor se tome el tiempo para retratar las relaciones humanas en escala de grises y eso es precisamente lo que Noah Baumbach consiguió al escribir y dirigir Marriage Story (Historia de un matrimonio).\nAquí seguimos el proceso de divorcio de Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) y Charlie (Adam Driver) ambos por demás de convincentes. Charlie es un director brillante en el mundo del teatro fuera de Broadway, mientras Nicole, su esposa y protagonista, es una actriz de cine oriunda de Los Ángeles que trasladó su residencia a Nueva York para acompañar a su esposo aportando además el toque de glamour en un momento crucial cuando la compañía teatral apenas daba sus primeros pasos. \nLa intención de Nicole es crecer juntos dentro y fuera de las tablas, sin embargo, se está volviendo mucho menos importante para un esposo que, a pesar de su inteligencia y encanto devastadores y bastante afectados, es indiferente a sus necesidades y opiniones.\nLa pareja está haciendo su esfuerzo por conseguir un trato sano que permita el crecimiento de Henry (Azhy Robertson) de la mejor forma posible, el problema es que no saben cómo lograrlo, razón por la cual siguen los consejos de sus abogados Nora (Laura Dern) y Jay (Ray Liotta) quienes desatan una guerra que ninguna de las partes defendidas estaba buscando.\nLa película es maravillosa, fuera de todos los clichés absurdos que constantemente llegan a la pantalla en los casos de divorcio, esta es una historia real cargada de drama en cada línea del guión sin que ello requiera de alguna exageración visceral de los actores.\nMarriage Story es maravillosamente dulce, triste y divertida simplemente ofrece más placer momento a momento que cualquier otra cosa. Sería reduccionista llamarlo autobiográfico, pero es notable cuán escrupulosamente generosa es Baumbach con la figura de la futura ex esposa, interpretada impecablemente por Scarlett Johansson a sabiendas que la inspiración para esta película fue la historia personal de la escritora. La película es hábilmente equilibrada y emocionalmente calibrada, aunque hay detalles incidentales sobre quién es el primero en defender un abogado, y una división del 55/45% en el acuerdo de custodia de los hijos. \nTal vez sienta cercana la historia porque una situación similar se vivió en casa y el resultado era similar (como ‘Henry', pero bastante más crecida, fui testigo). Explicar al mundo que luego de años de noviazgo o matrimonio puedes seguir amando a tu ex esposo o el padre de tu hijo, pero ya no de la misma manera, es un tema complejo. Habrá quien lo asocie con un tema de \"apego emocional\" o cualquier otra patología que justifique una consulta con el psicólogo, pero es algo simple. Todo matrimonio se construye con una cadena sistemática de experiencias, algunas positivas y algunas tal vez menos. Ese es el cuadro de una relación promedio, eso es una relación humana normal.\nLo Mejor: hay dos puntos a resaltar, las actuaciones y el guión, en ambos puntos el carisma y la honestidad elevan los diálogos de la escritora.\nLo Malo: Solo por ser exquisita, con tanta insistencia en la diferenciación entre una persona de Los Ángeles y una de New York, pudieron haber agregado algo de contenido que ilustrara el tema.",

He seems at his best when his work is personal, like 2005's The Squid & the Whale, when he was inspired by his own experience as a child of a divorcing couple. And now, having endured a divorce of his own as an adult, he has made another emotionally charged film that charts the breakdown of a marriage between Adam Driver's Charlie, a NY stage director and Scarlett Johansson's Nicole, an actress who has roots back in LA. Between career choices and their primary concern for their young son, the film explores the difficulties, nuances and facets of a relationship via its dissolution. Despite the title, it's actually an incisive and sobering look at their divorce and when lawyers start meddling, it further acts as an indictment against the flaws and failings of a system that only makes matters worse and far from harmonious. There's much inspired brilliance in Baumbach's handling of the material and in his presentation of snapshot moments during the months, if not years, before they finally make peace with it all. Scenes from a Divorce, if you like; and Baumbach invokes directors such as Allen, Bergman and Pollack, to great effect. Furthermore, Driver and Johansson's mesmerizing performances, especially when they are playing against each other, are infused with intimacies and conflicting emotions. If not for the Netflix stigma, their Oscar nominations are practically guaranteed after that fight scene at Charlie's house. At 136mins, the sometimes meandering duration can feel like cramming a 3-parter into one film, but it's justified as scenes are allowed to breathe and actors have time to flesh out their characters, resulting in something that's grounded yet poetic, hopelessly romantic but also hopefully optimistic.",

            "content": "Noah Baumbach is a writer and director most known for acerbic dramas with a very dark, pessimistic viewpoint. That changed somewhat once he began a filmmaking partnership with actress Greta Gerwig that began with 2013's Frances Ha. Gerwig has since gone on to become an accomplished filmmaker in her own right with 2017's Lady Bird, which earned her Oscar nominations for writing and directing. The partnership seemed to bring out a softer side for Baumbach and they became a romantic couple who had a child earlier in 2019. Hell, Gerwig and Baumbach are even circling writing a Barbie movie together. This is a changed filmmaker and he brings that changed perspective to Marriage Story. It's very different from Baumbach's other movie about divorce, 2005's The Squid and the Whale. I found that movie difficult, detached, and hard to emotionally engage with. Marriage Story, on the other hand, is a deeply felt, deeply observed, and deeply moving film experience that counts as one of the finest films of 2019.\n\nCharlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) are heading for divorce. He's a successful theater director. She was a successful movie actress who relocated to New York City and has gotten an offer to shoot a pilot in L.A. Both say they want what's best for their young son Henry (Azhy Robertson) but this will be tested as Charlie and Nicole push one another for what they feel is their best version of their family.\n\nThe observational detail in Marriage Story is awe inspiring. I was floored by how involved I got and how quickly, and that's because Baumbach has achieved what few filmmakers are able to, namely present a world of startling authenticity. There is a richness in the details, small and large, that makes the entire story feel like you've captured real life and thrown it onscreen. I wouldn't pry but Baumbach himself went through divorce around the time he was writing this, and I have to think some of those feelings and details seeped into this screenplay. Baumbach's direction favors clarity and giving his actors wide berths to unleash meaty monologues or dynamic dialogue exchanges. The writing is sensational and every character is given a point of view that feels well realized. Even the combative lawyers (Laura Dern, Ray Liotta) have perspectives you can see why they're fighting for what they believe is right. But it's watching Charlie and Nicole together that brings the most excitement. Watching the both of them onscreen allows for so much study the little histories behind their words, their gestures, their impulses, and they feel like a great mystery to unpack. It feels like a real relationship you've been dropped into and left to pick up the histories and contradictions and all the rest that make people who they are.\n\nIt's very easy and understandable for divorce dramas to essentially pick sides, to present a clearly defined protagonist and antagonist, like 1979's Kramer vs. Kramer. It's easier for an audience to have a clear side to root for and a clear villain to root against, someone who they can see is more responsible for this breakdown of the family unit or for the infliction of emotional pain. What Baumbach does is something rare and exceedingly compassionate; he makes us like these two people as a couple in the opening ten minutes so that we can see how they could have shared a loving relationship for so long. The opening is mirrored voice over where each spouse narrates what they love or admire about the other person, and by doing this it's like we too get to see these people in this adoring light. It's like a ten-minute love letter and then it gets ripped away. However, by starting with this foundation, Baumbach has invested the audience immediately. We care about both of these people because we've seen them at their best, and now as things get more acrimonious and harder, it hurts us too because of that emotional investment. Marriage Story does not adopt a side or ask its audience to choose. It presents both parties as essentially good people but with their flaws and combustibility that point to them being likely better apart. That doesn't mean they don't still care for one another or have essential elements of friendship. A simple shoelace tying at the very end of the movie nearly had me in tears because of its everyday act of kindness. These are complex human beings with needs, desires, egos, pressure points, and we watch both of them struggle through a stressful process where they're trying to do right but that definition keeps morphing with every next step. If there are villains, it's the lawyers, but even they are given degrees of explanation and perspectives to explain why they fight as hard as they do.\n\nI have read several reviews that disagree with my \"no sides\" assessment, citing how the movie presents more of Charlie's perspective during Act Two, and this is true. The extra time onscreen, however, doesn't erase his faults as a husband. The transition to this handover is Nicole unburdening herself to her lawyer (Dern) in a gorgeous seven-minute monologue. It's a thrilling moment for Johansson as the character begins guarded and afraid of saying anything too harsh, and then as she starts talking it's like you watch layer after layer get pulled free, allowing this woman to open up about her untended wants and desires and to legitimately be heard in perhaps the first time in a decade, and it's so powerful and sympathetic and natural. To then think that Baumbach intends to portray this same woman as a villain seems like a misreading. The second act does involve Charlie being more reactive to the new obstacles of divorce, like being forced to hire a lawyer to officially respond, to start a residence in L.A., and to eventually be observed by an evaluator of the court. He holds to the belief that he and Nicole don't need the acrimony, don't need the pain, and that they can be adults when it comes to deciding their end. Whether this is naivety will depend on your own worldview, but holding to this belief gets Charlie playing catch-up a lot and having to roll with changes for fear of being seen as an uncooperative parent, like when Nicole's friends don't want to go trick-or-treating with Charlie present so he's forced into a second later more pathetic outing. We do get to see Charlie beset with challenges but that doesn't erase Nicole's challenges too.\n\nFor a movie as deeply human as this one, it's also disarming just how funny it can be. The humor is never cheap or distracting but just another element that makes Marriage Story so adept. While the movie has its lows, it can also find delicate and absurd humor in the moment, reminding the audience that life isn't always doom and gloom even when things are going poorly. The sequence where Nicole and her sister (Merritt Weaver, wonderful) are bickering over the exact steps to legally serve Charlie divorce papers reminded me of a screwball comedy, how the nerves and fumbles of the characters were elevating the experience into touching the absurd. Nicole's entire family is a great comedic array of characters including her mother (Julie Hagerty) who says she has her own personal relationship with her daughter's ex-husband that she wishes to maintain. They even have pet names for one another (this brought back memories for me as I've had mothers of ex-girlfriends still want to talk with me weeks after their daughter dumped me). The legal asides are also filled with absurdist moments of comedy about double-speak and the arcane or idiosyncratic rules of divorce and representation in the courts. The sequence of Charlie being watched by the deadpanned court evaluator (Martha Kelley, TV's Baskets) is a terrific example of cringe comedy. He's trying to impress her but she's generally unflappable, to hilarious degree, and it only leads to more miscues that Charlie tries to ignore or downplay to win her favor.\n\nMake no mistake, Marriage Story is also one of the hardest hitting dramas of the year. Because we like both participants, because there is something at stake, watching them tear each other apart is a painful and revelatory experience. There is one gigantic confrontation that, like Nicole's first confession, begins small and cordial and builds and builds in intensity, to the point where walls are punched, threats are unleashed, and both parties end in tears. It's a thrilling sequence that feels akin to watching the defusing of a bomb ready to explode. Baumbach never feels the need to artificially inflate his drama, so we stick with that observational and compassionate ethos that has guided the entire film, even during the ugly moments. These are two people with pain and frustrations who both feel they have been wronged and are in the right. They're both entitled to their pain, they're both at fault for letting things get to this precipice, and they can both acknowledge that as well. Because even at their worst, Nicole and Charlie are still portrayed as human beings and human beings worthy of our empathy. They aren't heroes or villains, they're simply real people trying to navigate a hard time with conflicting feelings and needs.\n\nThe acting is outstanding. Driver (BlackkKlansman) is sensational and goes through an emotional wringer to portray Charlie, trying to stay above it all for so long and losing parts of himself along the way. His outbursts are raw and cut right through, but it's also his smaller moments of ignorance, dismissiveness, or tenderness that linger, providing a fuller picture of who Charlie is, why one could fall in love with him and why one could fall out of love. I fully expect Driver to be the front-runner for the Best Actor Oscar. He even gets to sing a Sondheim tune and uses it as a reflection point. A late moment, when he's reading a particular letter, drew tears and got me choked up. He's always been such a visceral actor, a man with a magnetic charisma and animalistic sense of energy that draws your attention. He's finally found a role that showcases how brilliant an actor Driver can be. This is also easily the best work of Johansson's (Avengers: Endgame) career. Let there be no doubt – this woman can be a tremendous actress with the right material. She's struggling with her sense of identity, being tied to Charlie for so long, and \"wanting my own Earth\" for so long that the dissolution process is both tumultuous but also exciting for what it promises. Nicole can take those chances, her Hollywood viability still alive, and strike out doing the things she's wanted to do, like direct. Her character has felt like a supportive prisoner for so long and now she gets to make a jailbreak. Johansson is an equal partner onscreen to Driver, trading the tenderness and hostility moment-for-moment.\n\nThis is Noah Baumbach's finest film to date, and I adored Frances Ha. I was expecting a degree of bitterness from the normally prickly filmmaker, and that's to be had considering the subject matter of divorce. What I wasn't expecting was the depth of feeling and compassion that flows from this movie's very steady beating heart. It feels real and honest in a way that a movie simply about the horrors of divorce and breakups and custody battles could not. Baumbach's characters aren't just meant to suffer and inflict pain, they're meant to come through the other side with something still intact. I'd argue that Marriage Story, even with its suffering, is ultimately a hopeful movie. It shows how two people can navigate the pain they've caused one another and still find an understanding on the other side. Driver and Johansson are fantastic and deliver two of the finest acting performances of this year. Baumbach's incredible level of detail makes the movie feel instantly authentic, lived-in, and resonant. I was hooked early, pulling for both characters, and spellbound by the complexity and development. There isn't a false note in the entire two-plus hours onscreen. It feels like you're watching real people. Marriage Story is a wonderful movie and I hope people won't be scared off by its subject matter. It's funny, empathetic, and resoundingly humane, gifting audiences with a rich portrait. It should be arriving to Netflix streaming by December 6, so fire up your queue and have the tissues at the ready.\n\nNate's Grade: A",

Audience REACTIONS at its Canadian PREMIERE: 😄😄😄😄😄😂😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄(14 laughing scenes) 😭(1 cry) 👏👏(2 applauses during film) 🏆TIFF Peoples Choice 1st Runner Up 🏆(strong Oscar potential for: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress - Scarlett Johansson, Best Actor - Adam Driver, Best Supporting Actress - Laura Dern, Best Original Screenplay, Best Film Editing) Marriage Story (Noah Baumbach) is a raw and deeply real portrayal of love, divorce, and family. It is a combination of a love story, screwball comedy, musical, and procedural drama. While the blend of styles at a point comes across as forced, the film as a whole is a brilliant work, telling a story rather than following the genre troupes many films fall into. This is a simple story originally executed. Extremely character driven, the cast play their roles perfectly. Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver lead the balanced portrayal of a divorcing couple. This film will impact viewers differently depending on many factors, especially their life stage and past experiences with relationships, marriage, and divorce. The film is so well balanced that one viewer will relate more to one character while the person beside them may be more drawn to the other. Regardless of which lead you relate to more, you are bound to be shaken by the deeply emotional performances of both. A nod to the cast would be incomplete without a special mention for Laura Dern and Ray Liotta whose characters come to life in significant scenes of their own. The director shared at TIFF that at many times during filming he felt like he was watching the actor’s movie rather than his and this truly shines through in their collective performance. Out of the many films we saw in Toronto over two weeks, Marriage Story likely has the best odds for this year’s Oscar wins. #filmreactiviews ",

            "content": "BLAMER VS. BLAMER - My Review of MARRIAGE STORY (4 Stars)\n\nWhite middle class couples getting divorced haven't really set the cinematic universe on fire for many many years.  In its heyday, such films as Ordinary People, Kramer Vs. Kramer, and An Unmarried Woman garnered serious box office and Oscar attention.  Nowadays, it's a miracle if a small indie tackles the subject and gets a streaming release.  Tastes have shifted.  Other issues have taken up more importance in our collective minds.  Other voices have rightfully staked their claim.  So, when I heard Noah Baumbach's latest film had made its way to the top of many lists, I felt an enormous amount of skepticism.  Do we really need to see a successful theater director and his actor wife fight over which lovely home in which wonderful town they can agree upon to raise their young son?  I smelled huge blowouts around huge kitchen islands in my moviegoing future.   \n\nLuckily, Baumbach, always an astute observer of human behavior, knows people like me all too well and prepared himself for the backlash by inserting a scene in which a courtroom judge lays out the champagne problems of it all.  With that at the very least acknowledged, we end up with a searing, detailed, emotionally powerful, beautifully acted story less about divorce but about finding one's humanity in times of crisis.  It opens with a beautifully realized montage in which Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) read from essays they've written about each other over highly specific scenes from their marriage.  The sequence ends, however, with those essays being presented to a mediator who presides over their separation.  Charlie and Nicole seem effortlessly polite and sometimes loving with each other, promising to eschew lawyers and make their split amicable.  Perhaps because they have a young son, Henry (Azhy Robertson) or maybe they're just good people, but their divorce feels…nice.  We know that won't last.  \n\nSoon enough, Nicole has left their comfy New York home to star in a pilot in Los Angeles.  There, she's introduced to a powerful divorce attorney Nora (Laura Dern) who with her serenely cutting line deliveries ensures an ugly battle ahead.  This move forces Charlie to lawyer up with the scene-stealing Alan Alda as his council.  From here, the film starts to resemble a courtroom drama, but it avoids the all-too familiar tropes by bringing us those in-between scenes in which Charlie and Nicole hash things out in private.  It's a scenario played out with equal parts kindness and dread as each reveals details and motives better left unsaid.  It culminates in a stunning argument, a gut punch of a ten minute sequence in which Driver and Johansson do the best work of their careers to date.  Same goes for a matching pair of musical sequences in which each actor sings Sondheim songs from \"Company\", and, against all odds, it works like gangbusters.  \n\nIt also helps that the supporting cast delivers on all fronts.  Aside from Dern, who almost runs away with the movie and practically demands a standalone Nora spinoff project, I loved Julie Hagerty and Merritt Wever as Nicole's mother and sister respectively.  Wever mines so much comedy out of a scene in which she needs to serve Charlie his divorce papers and Hagerty, who has reached National Treasure status by now, kills with her patented goofball charm.  Ray Liotta has a field day as one of Charlie's attorneys, sparring with Nora while also finding these credible grace notes when the two trade light, personal anecdotes.  There's the famous quote, \"Hollywood is the only place where you can die of encouragement\", and nowhere is this more true than in the dynamics between Dern and everyone else with whom she shares the screen.  We're used to her delicious freakouts, but here, she glides on a razor blade and in one amazing monologue, she more than earns her inevitable Oscar nomination.  A special mention also goes to Martha Kelly (Baskets) who uses her deadpan delivery to perfection in her scenes as a parental evaluator.  \n\nBaumbach does some of his best writing and directing here.  Clearly he has taken a page out of the Woody Allen playbook of allowing for offscreen space and framing which accentuates the distance between characters, but he also deftly utilizes monologues and creates a sense of urgency despite saddling his actors with overwritten dialogue.  In lesser hands this would have felt like a bad play, but this film blends humor and drama so well, you may find yourself completely wrapped up in it.  I also loved the scene in which our two leads shut a stuck gate.  It's a fine example of how editing and matching shots can achieve an intended effect. This film could have easily slipped into cornball pathos, but because the characters have reached such vivid levels, it never does.  By the time it reaches its wonderful throwaway of a final scene, which could have gone the way of so many \"important\" moments we've seen endlessly, you may find yourself exhausted but completely in love with these flawed, unpredictable, and unforgettable characters.  Marriage Story makes the divorce movie important again.",

A devastating portrayal of divorce that can bring out the ugly in people, especially with child custody. But it's not all doom and gloom. It's incredibly heartfelt with plenty of humorous moments. I guess you have to find the comedy during the difficulties in life. Lets just say my cheeks wasn't dry afterwards.\n\nAnd yes, I wept.\n\nAdam Driver and Scarlett Johansson both gave masterclass performances. And I do mean some power house acting. Driver plays Charlie, a competitive and undaunted theatre director that he is very clear about what he wants. Johansson plays Nicole, a mother who's a delightful presence and loves to play, but is also a dedicated actor. This is the best I've seen from Johnasson. Her character delivers a monougle where she's explains the issues in her life that's all shot in one take, which brilliantly displays her acting chops where she naturally shifts from emotion to emotion - it was impeccable.\n\nThe supporting cast were all fantastic. Lauren Dern, Ray Liotta, Merritt Wever, Julie Hagerty, and Alan Alda were all brilliant and really bounce off the energy from Driver and Johansson. Even the child actor held his own between these juggernauts of actors.\n\nNot only are the performances the strongest element of the movie, but so is the writing. Every character is so uniquely fleshed out that the conflict feels so incredibly raw. It's one of the reasons why I was so glued to the movie from start to finish. One of the best screenplays of the year.\n\nThis is the first Noah Baumbach movie I've seen from him and I am aware of his other work, just haven't got around to watching them. However, I feel like this was the best introduction to him as a director, because he crafted such a sympathetic look on marriage dissolving away. We don't see the full relationship, but we do get to hear Nicole and Charlie individually describe what their love about each other, while there's a montage that flash's through their routine life together with their son. Nothing visually striking in the presentation, but not once did it feel stale.\n\nThe score from Randy Newman was terrific and fitted wonderfully with the movie. I loved the aspect ratio as it added a lot to the overall mood of the movie. When the two go head to head in the custody battle - that doesn't mean they're enemies. They still talk to each other as if they are still a thing. It's also hard to pick aside, because you understand where each of them are coming from, and even if you do choose, you still feel bad for either one.\n\nOverall rating: Any other relationship movie aint sh*t compared to this.",

Kramer.\"  Instead, you have a series of well-produced and well-acted theater skits, cobbled together into a movie that doesn't really make sense.  Spoiler Alert: Would a successful director & actress experienced with agents really be so clueless about lawyers?   Solid acting, especially from Laura Dern, who steals every scene.  But there is zero chemistry between Johannson and Driver.  Good movie should've been great.",
