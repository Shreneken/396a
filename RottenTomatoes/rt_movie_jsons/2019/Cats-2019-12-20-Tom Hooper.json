            "content": "Okay idk what people were expecting when they watched this, but they're wrong and Cats is good. You have to remember that the original poem was written by TS Eliot, which helps explain why most people can't follow it. Or why many of these reviews boldly claim that there is no plot. I actually thought the plot was easier to follow here than either the play or the original poem. Maybe it's because the plot revolves around the anticipatory revelation of the next \"jellicle\" cat, which is never defined, but that's what makes Cats special. It's unfamiliar. It's unclear. But it's magical. \n\nI would recommend folks go into this with a little background on Eliot and modernism in general. Personally, I don't like modernism for this very reason. It's referential, in that it contains allusions to prior work (one Cat even refers to their surroundings as a \"wasteland\"). This context makes the whole film a bizarre and grotesque modernist interpretation not only of the play Cats, but of the poem Cats (originally titled Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats). It makes the whole experience hilarious and infinitely more interesting and fun. TS Eliot probably would have hated it, which brings me great joy because I sort of hate TS Eliot. \n\nThe performances and songs are good. The cats look creepy, but that's sort of the point. Again, wtf were people expecting?? I went into this film assuming it would be the worst thing I had ever seen given the reputation it has, and when it ended I can honestly say it was one of the more engaging and entertaining films I've seen in a while. Highly recommended, just temper your expectations before viewing. You're not about to watch a Hollywood movie, you're going to watch an abstract and hard-to-follow art film veiled as a Hollywood movie by the star-studded cast.",

I did have several fits of laughter, but not at any parts the makers wanted to make amusing. A couple of times, I turned the volume down to zero as this helped me get through to the end.

We didn't find the CGI enhancements weird or \"nightmarish.\"  In fact, we thought the moving ears and tails made them look better. Acting was great and the choreography was excellent. Some of the songs were quite good, to be honest.  Personally, I wouldn't say that Jennifer Hudson's rendition of \"Memory\" was one of the greatest, but it sure was heartfelt. Judi Dench and Idris Elba looked great here. Francesca Hayward is an excellent dancer, plus she knows how to act. We genuinely liked the movie, so I suppose it's just a matter of taste. For us, it felt like we were watching a Disney or Tim Burton movie. So, to each his own, I guess.",

If you think the costumes are good, you either rented the 90s version, or you can't tell CGI from reality.  🐈🐈🐈\n\nBut like I said, it's bad to the point of being funny, so don't take it seriously & think of it as a comedy, like The Room, or any number of severely botched buggy video games with hilarious glitches. I'm sure by 2029 it will become a cult classic.  🐈🐈🐈\n\nThe music in this version is a travesty though. Manages to botch every single song, choking the melody with drama. Not something I would listen to in a car or studying. Barbara Streisand did an excellent cover of Memory. Elaine Page gave audiences goosebumps in a good way. Jennifer Hudson is an actress, not a singer, & the song really suffers for it. Being the most important song in the musical, it's actually a travesty of a cover. 🐈🐈🐈\n\n& you might as well watch both versions, because it has made sooo many tweaks to the plot & characters, adding new characters that remove the agency of established characters, replacing characters, consolidating characters, altering the plot, changing the protagonist, having a protagonist show up before the halfway mark, changing the end through a misinterpretation of the lyrics, turning songs that should have 4 singers into solos, messing up the tempo & the melody... Both movies will give you different experiences.",

            "content": "Short review:  One stellar number, one good number, and a lot of bad stuff.  How anyone could make a musical and think it's ok to have bad musical performances is totally beyond me.\n\nLonger review:  I've seen... ok that's not correct... I've fast forwarded through Cats, stopping to sample here and there and staying longer if it's interesting.\n\nThe absolute worst number, musically, was Jenny Annie Dots, performed by ...what's her name... Rebel Wilson. I know she's done musicals before but she was strangely off pitch and off beat for the entire performance. Sad, because I really enjoyed the original stage version of that number.\n\nSecond worse, and it pains me to say it, was Sir Ian McKellen as Gus the Theater Cat. I mean, I've seen the theater production several times and have the DVD from that, and the original is very nostalgic and melancholy, but the movie performance is just ... sad. Like seeing a great actor trapped in a character he just can't get his arms around. His song just wanders, as the instruments struggle to keep up. See the original, it's heartrending. Which I guess the movie performance also is, for an entirely different reason.\n\nThere ARE good performances. Taylor Swift's McCavity is decent. But by far, the gem of the film, is Skimbleshanks the railway cat. This is a magnificent number that improves dramatically on the original, which was -- let's face it -- a little on the boring side. But the movie version has an amazing tap dance number and visuals that go way beyond what you could do on stage and a performance that's unmatched in the rest of the film. It's almost worth sitting through the movie just for that segment. This is what the the rest of the movie SHOULD have been.\n\nThere's a good video on youtube about why the music in the Cats film is so poor. It's called\n\nWhy the Music in Cats is Worse than you Thought and is worth watching.\n\nSo yeah, the fur effects were sketchy-to-revolting, some of the casting choices didn't make any sense, and most of the songs did not work. The songs themselves are fine, (see the stage play) it's the performance that's not up to par. As \"Sideways\" says in his video, we weren't watching a movie, we were watching the world's most expensive rehearsal.\n\nAnd yet... the Skimbleshanks number gives us an idea of what the film could have been, had better decisions been made.\n\nThe reason Skimbleshanks and McCavity worked when the others didn't, is the director's decision to let the vocalists of those other numbers improv on stage, and task the orchestra with doing their best to keep up. This left performances that were not only off key a bit but were also all over the place timing-wise. In contrast, the two numbers that WORKED are the only ones done to a click track, to keep everyone on time. Skimbleshanks because of the unusual time signature (13/8) and McCavity because... well let's face it, Taylor Swift doesn't sing in the shower without a click track. She couldn't afford to have a bad performance on her resume.\n\nBut two good performances, perhaps totaling seventeen minutes, does not save a nearly two hour film.\n\nBut like a bad superbowl game, you can always see the good bits on youtube later.",

All they did was add a few extra lines, added a few extra places and called it a script. Then they added useless characters that had no use in the story at all just so they can have more celebrities on. I’d also like to add that the editors clicks have made the characters less creepy. Honestly this entire movie movie could have been an animated movie for kids. The fur just looked like really weird body suits that made everyone seem naked it felt awkward to watch. ",

The cgi is uncanny and terrifying, but after watching the superior 1998 version, it makes me mad how much they butchered the characters. I could write an essay on it, but I don't want to think about it any further and more experienced critics have. I have no idea what prompted a 53% for the audience rating because this movie is hot garbage. Should I even mention how giving a story with no plot a protagonist is a terrible idea? Overall, I wouldn't even wish this movie on my worst enemies. It's full of wasted potential and is a massive disappointment. If I could rate it zero stars, I would. If I could rate it negative stars, I 100% would. I feel so bad for every single fan of the original musical, especially the diehard ones. 10% of the movie is okay and the other 90% is terrible.

It's just not making sense to me. they go from being regular sized humans, to being small, then big again in a matter of seconds. Yes, the magic of musicals, but you also want to make musicals realistic, even though it will be completely fiction. Talking cats, that i get, but what i dont get, is why the budget for this movie is 95 million. I think that, the money should have gone to far better things than this movie. Who knew, that i would be writting a review about cats, in 2020.  I now can finally say \"im crying because of a movie\" and actually mean it. \n\tThe Characters are introduced without even an introduction. They have magic? Where is the monolouge? maybe I am missing the whole point, but what even is the point? I never think practically when i watch musicals, movies, plays, or shows, because i just automatically think, It's all part of the act. The actors didnt know that the movie they were going to act in would get a bad reputation as soon as it came out. Again, there are too many music numbers. Where is the monolouge? I mean, there is some, but the cuts, and scene changes make no sense. The plot? what even is it?  \nYes, this movie is about cats, but it doesnt follow a single plot. You know how when we babble when we get excited. A run on sentence in real life pretty much. That is what i think this movie is. A RUN ON SENTENCE. \n\tIt is repetitive....\n\tRepulsive\n\tConlicted....\nIt seems as if there is no true resolution to the conflict that was placed in the beginning. My father told me to give this musical a chance, because i tend to dislike things without even getting to know it. I did give it a chance, and i take it back. On very rare occasions do i ever regret things, but this, this, is the one i most regret. GIVING IT ANOTHER CHANCE. \n\tA cat version of a surf and turf war.....\nThe dance battle made no sense. So are they friends or enemies. \nMaybe i should write like how the movie is made. One big repetitive, run on sentence. Or maybe i can create one of dogs. \n\tOh, look the main character is scared and overwhelemed. Didnt see that coming. \nSo is the setting, in some abandoned city? Where the cats are small, yet giants at the same time?  Am I truly missing something? I am not bored, I am HORRIFIED. dance with ghosts? what???? \n\tIt is too edited. This truly overwhelms me. Realism? I have a lot concerns, and questions. \nNotice, how I am not writing with proper grammar, or writing properly. That is how i think the movie was written. So, I will write in such manner, that truly highlights the movie. \nAm I being mean? Maybe, but I am being honest. \nSo is this movie, meant to be dramatic or comedic, or entertaining. Because i saw none of that. A little drama, but not enough to catch once eye. I mean, i must admit, amazing choreography. \n\tCHAOTIC\n\tCONFUSING\nAgain, i am lost. A train? They are the size of toddlers now??? \nYou can tell that some people lied about the movie on some reviews. 5 stars, a bit much. 3 is understandle. \n\tArent you supposed to introduce characters in someway? doesnt really matter the name. It matters on what role they play. RELATIONS, where is that? \n\tLove interest? Where in the world is the main character? Did those two cats just disappear in that boat? What are they signing about? Cavity, ghosts, or did they just throw in abunch of random words, and said \"it rhymes, so it must work\".\n\tIs this jazz, blues, or whatever you call this? THERE IS NO SET PLOT. \n\tWhat is going on? You dont know? I dont either? maybe that's the plot. THERE ISNT ONE. MAGIC POWDER. My cavity, or macavity? \n\tWhere did they get the magic? how? Where is the story line? what does it follow? these are questions that are not answered in the movie. Try to justify it, and you would just go mad trying to explain it. \n\n\"walk the plank\"???? are they pirate cats now? What is going on? Is it night forever? or is this like a werewolf type of situation, where they are actually humans that turn into cats during the night? \nHow can one sing, nonstop? A migrain waiting to happen. \nI am done, this movie, doesnt deserve a chance. This doesn't deserve to be praised. \nGood day, and Good bye. \n\tOn the behalf of the people who watched this film, I am sorry for telling the harsh truth, and my harsh opinion.

Jennifer Hudson singing Memory was so powerful, raw, and real. When you know that Dame Judi Dench injured her achilles right before she was to star in the original production makes watching her play Deuteronomy that much more satisfying. Rebel Wilson and James Corden make their roles more fun and enjoyable to watch. My kids have been asking to hear the music ever since.",

Everything about. The visuals. The plot. The pacing. The expressions. The setting. And most definitely, The cats. This movie is horrid, gross, and disgusting and oh my god I love it. Ever since I first heard this movie was going to be made and saw an image of it I just knew I was going to love it. Unintentionally this movie is so absurd and amusing that it leads to an experience that is laughable and hilarious. When I first saw Cats it was about a month or two after its release and the reviews were already out there. The consensus among these reviews was an obvious \"This movie is one of the worst cinematic experiences I've ever been a part of\". Movie critics have a job and that is to give a professional opinion on whether or not they enjoyed a movie. Unfortunately this job entails an incredibly stuck up attitude that usually fogs up their perception of a movie and not taking it for what it is, entertainment. We all knew Cats was a cash grab, from the star studded cast to the budget alone that was entirely apparent. But what critics don't seem to realize is that even though it was a critical and box office failure, Cats succeeded at one thing and that was being pure unadulterated entertainment. Although it was a huge waste of money, Cats is a movie that will be ingrained in the brains of our society for a very long time.  One of my favorite pastimes, and I'm sure many of yours too, is to watch cringeworthy or just terrible things whether it be movies, television, or YouTube videos. Cats is a movie I have watched four times and I'm sure as you have guessed is no exception to being one of these things I like to watch. Even though it is cringeworthy and terrible Cats is a movie that doesn't let you look away; unlike many unwatchable movies, Cats is a movie that takes a risk and doesn't end up being boring or bland. So yes I love Cats and yes I want so much more content like it.",

I tried to understand, but after 30 minutes I stopped watching the movie. Honestly, this is a waste of time and you should not spend time watching this. It is weird. The cats don't wear any clothes and just look weird. If the music was good, I might have given this a two star review. The actors are doing good with the movements, but after a while I got bored.

Did Rocky Horror Picture Show make any sense? Neither does Cats and that ok! There is no beginning, middle or end. There is no real plot, and it's based off of TS Elliot's book of poems. It's meant to be lighthearted fun, and geared at kids. Isn't the whole reason we go to the movies or show is to escape reality? This movie has a ton of great stars, fantastic music and dancing and it is pretty true to the original musical- for the most part. I enjoyed it and don't see anything wrong with the CGI work that they did. In fact it looks like they did a lot of great CGI work to make them look And movie like cats.

Idris Elba as Macavity stole every scene in which he appeared. Rum Tum Tugger (!!!) played by Jason Derulo very good. Ian McKellen as Gus gave a totally professional performance. And Jennifer Holmes can certainly belt out \"Memories.\"  Rebel and Judi-absolutely miscast.  I'd never seen the play, didn't understand the attraction.  It's odd, and blazingly bright and colorful, so for those reasons see it.  Worst thing?Bad:  It's a rather messy storyline and is the music pure old-school broadway (Hamilton changed stage shows for good and I think that's the biggest problem: after Hamilton, Cats isn't relevant as a show/movie.)  We will forever watch Phantom of Opera, Les Miserables, Sound of Music and more because every song was great. But not so with Cats. This show may have looked great on stage, but the close-ups in the film looked like hairy humans, not cats at all.  This just wasn't movie material.  But it's like nothing else. Oh, Taylor Swift fine, but her entrance is the BIG entrance in the entire movie and her roll is so small the entrance didn't make sense. I have seen on youtube the exit-to-the-stars at the end of the stage show and I have no idea why Hopper changed it so much for the film. But again, it's like no other movie ever.  And it could very well have a huge cult following in the future.  Like I said, the film appearing AFTER \"Hamilton\" (and after Greatest Showman film with updated dancing) was \"Cats\" biggest downfall.",

            "content": "Abandon all hope, you who enter here. Mayhaps the title has caught your sinful gaze, or maybe morbid curiosity has gotten the best of you; who could judge such an awful taste in topics? \nSurely, as you may have noticed, this is going to be about the truly atrocious hot garbage fire that is the movie, \"Cats 2019\".\n\nI myself, am not a professional writer. In fact, I'm a self-proclaimed idiot with so little life left in me that I sat through this entire movie for the sole amusement of no one, because I'm not quite as entertaining as your average YouTuber. \n\nHowever, I find it quite easy to describe this movie as the 10th circle of hell. Thence why I will explain it in the circles of hell.\n\nThe circles are technically there to suffer endlessly, starting at the first circle; Limbo. \n\nLimbo is the edge of hell, according to Dante's inferno it's there where the unbaptized souls wander \"Here suffer those who did not sin, yet did not have the required portal of our faith. Their punishment is the denial of Paradise\". They're punished only by being exiled from God's presence forever. \nI can connect this to the movie because it felt like I was about to descent into hell the minute I typed it in my search bar, almost as if it was a horrible idea. Which it was. \n\nThe second circle of hell is Lust, blown about by violent and endless winds. The circle of Lust is composed of an immense, rocky chasm with the structural ends of a broken bridge residing on each side, no way to cross it. It's said to contain a lightning storm which traps the souls of the lustful inside till time comes to its end. \nNow, what has this to do with cats? You poor uneducated soul… Those cats in the movie are lusting after the idea of being chosen to die in their music suicide cult, and they're also horny. For God's sake. \n\nThe third circle of Hell is Gluttony, bombarded with rain, hail, and black snow. It's here where the soul of those gluttonous come to hang out with each other, mayhaps even consume each other as some sources say, but I do not like to think of that. \nI doubt I have to explain what resembles this in Cats 2019, but in case you still want to know, the movie itself is absolutely disgusting and yet you cannot stop it despite getting nauseous--almost like that bag of chips I ate at 7AM yesterday morning… \n\n\n\nNext up, there's Greed. For the crime of Greed do these souls suffer. Those clerks asquint of mind made no measured spending in life. Within the circle are occupants who are boiled alive in molten gold below, condemned for hoarding too closely or spending too freely with riches. \nThis relates to the movie because to be frank, the creators were probably too greedy to make sick stacks to really study cats their faces and fur and maybe like, actually make good designs and CGI. Like holy man, man horse, was it bad! I doubt any of them has ever seen a cat in real life. \n\nThe 5th circle is Anger, also known as Wrath. See the souls over whom anger prevailed. In the warm bath of the sun they were hateful. This is the final circle of Hell to be associated with the Seven Deadly Sins. Mayhaps a landscape of poison, yet some claim it's the fire that rages endlessly which rules the lands. It's here where the souls of the wrathful end their journey. \nFinally, I get to talk about the feeling this movie gives me. As soon as I saw the first few minutes, I was overcome by rage. How could someone ruin something so badly that it makes Dragonball Evolution look good? It's truly maddening. \n\nHersey is the 6th circle of hell. Here you will find the heretics and followers of every cult and pagan sect, all buried together, burning in eternal fire. The blazing tombs and coffins will stay open until the end of time, when they will be sealed forever. \nThis can be related to the movie because it felt like an endless train of suffering and it'll stay in my mind forever. It feels like an endless cycle of forever burning alive to even watch it. The music isn't even original, it's from a musical. After this, Hersey would seem like heaven. \n\nThe 7th circle is Violence. The first ring is wholly for the violent. Because violence can be done to three persons, in three rounds it is divided: violence unto one's neighbor, unto one's self, and unto God. The first ring is related to violence, being forced to swim in endless seas of blood. The second ring is related to suicide, suffering the fate of being transformed into thorny trees and being torn apart by harpies. The third and last ring relates to blasphemy, they suffer the fate of wandering a desert of blazing sands with never-ending rain and fire. \nAny of these fates would seem like mercy compared to watching Cats 2019. The longer I watch it, the further I descent into hell. The CGI tap dance made me wish those harpies would just come to get me. Hell, even that desert sounds good. \n\nFraude, the 8th circle of hell. Ten ditches leading down the final circle. Each filled with its own crimes, its own forms of punishment. The Circle of Fraud is a pitch black place that held those guilty of fraud, knowing evil; those who used lies and deception for personal gain. The circle is cut into 10 different ditches, each holding a different type of liar, and each had a different but fitting form of punishment.\nThis circle relates to the movie because whenever a song started, a new insanity began. And with it came a new suffering. Song after song, all about a character to never be seen again, but for what? What's the reason for it? There's no story, no interesting characters, one can only speculate why it was made. \n\nThat which used to be the final, 9th circle, happens to be treachery. The lowest, blackest, and farthest from Heaven. This was once the last circle of hell dedicated to those people who betrayed their loved ones, friends, best friends, countries, cities, guests and even to their masters. This is also known as the former pit of hell.\nIt symbolizes how betrayed I felt by the movie industry for making such an abomination of a movie, just to increase the already horrific reputation CGI has. However, this is nothing compared to Cats 2019.\n\nFinally, we've made it to the final circle, Cats 2019. One would not be able to guess that below the treachery lays something far uglier and sinful. It's hidden beneath the torments of a thousand to scare those who dare touch it's foul existence. Only the bravest of fools have dared to set foot into the insanity itself. \nThis film is so butchered it ruins the entire thing. There's no plot, no fascinating characters and horrific visuals. Truly, the only thing good about it is the music, which isn't even original but taken from the musical and performed by others. However, just because it sounds nice doesn't mean it is worth it. The songs are just a way of saying, \"I'm this cat and I do this\" only for the character to never been seen again. The entire movie is character introduction, some suicide cult shit and this guy being evil because he's evil. The cats constantly shift sizes whenever it's convenient, and they do not give a shit about quite literally any logic. It truly made me wish I believe in God, so I had something to pray to because this movie has driven me to the point of wishing to pray for just once in my life. I pray to the fucking gods of movies to take this thing down, remove it from everyone's memory and wipe it from existence for good.",

            "content": "Who? Who in their right mind thought that a surreal, virtually plotless musical such as Cats would lend itself well to a live-action style presented in the same structure as Les Miserables? Greedy executives who were hoping the movie would get an Oscar. Why? Because Les Miserables was nominated for Best Picture and Tom Hooper's prior film The King's Speech did win. Even though an animated movie would've worked MUCH better, especially since animated musicals don't get as much flak as live-action ones...at least, when they aren't actively aping Disney. I feel bad for the people involved because they were trying to make it work, with a few who decided to have fun (Taylor Swift) and good choreography. But man, does it appeal to nobody. Never seen the musical? The story's just an excuse to justify all these songs that give you little-to-no time to breathe. Come on, Les Mis did have quiet moments, believe it or not. Love the musical? The changes are gonna piss you off. Are you a furry? Firstly, this is a family-friendly movie...I think. Secondly, the lyrics clash with the horniness. Finally, the borderline terrifying designs (that's not mocap, by the way. It's some type of rotoscoping with software developed specifically for this movie. You'd think somebody would've taught Tom Hooper how much of a pain in the ass the animation process can be.) are guaranteed to prevent furries from being turned on by these pussies. Seriously, why didn't you just make an animated Cats movie? Especially since that WAS THE ORIGINAL PLAN FOR THE FILM ADAPTATION!!! If you like this movie, even unironically, that's okay. There's nothing wrong about it. It can feel pretty exciting being a rebel. But unfortunately, being a fan of musical movies myself (I unapologetically enjoyed a musical about newsboys going on strike, despite acknowledging the absurdity of such an idea), Cats felt like a bad fever dream, what with the freaky structure of everything (these tiny cat-monsters within those oversized sets. I don't know what the musical was like but that doesn't translate well into live-action) and the misguided attempt to capture lightning in a bottle twice. Yes, the 2012 Les Mis movie wasn't ACCLAIMED, but at least it had all the good elements that would guarantee Oscar nominations and told a coherent story despite there being very little spoken dialogue. The point is, the present that cats usually leave in their litter boxes smells better than this stinker.",

            "content": "‘Cats' by Andrew Lloyd Webber isn't my favorite musical because, while it is visually brilliant and beautifully sung, the story is very light and minimal and the style is very dated. Nevertheless, the show was the longest-running musical from the early 1980's until the late 90's and started the long trend of family-friendly mega-blockbusters on Broadway. Based on a collection of poems by T.S. Eliot, ‘Cats' the musical introduces one Jellicle cat, it sings a dynamic number and gets cast aside among the ensemble, rinse and repeat, like fashion models on the runway. As for Cats the movie, Tom Hooper gives an already incoherent narrative a plot so the movie would seem real to the cinematic eye. Victoria the White Cat (Francesca Hayward), who has no dialogue and one dance number in the show, is the main character who goes through a journey, I guess, but barely does anything to earn her Jellicle trophy. Macavity (Idris Elba) has more screen time than the episodic show as the antagonist who kidnaps other Jellicle cats: Asparagus (Ian McKellan), Jennyanydots (Rebel Wilson), Bustopher Jones (James Corden), and Old Deuteronomy (Judi Dench). Lastly, Hooper feeds the script with terrible cat puns on par with the ones from Catwoman and suggests an even worse adlib job from Corden and Wilson. The only redeeming value in Cats the movie is the song soundtrack, performed by giants like Jennifer Hudson and Taylor Swift. Even ballerina Miss Hayward produces a beautiful innocent voice in her feature debut to incorporate with her dancing talents. Beyond that, I'll forgive the hideous humanoid cat special effects, but with the story mixed into an already plotless musical, Cats was a complete mess. (1 ½ Scary CGI Jellicles out of 5)",

But if you like the fine arts you just may like it.\n\nTake the dancing for example. The protagonist is played by Francesca Hayward who is the Principal ballerina at The Royal Ballet. She delivers a performance that is breathtaking in elegance and style. She deftly expresses mood and movement at a level of sophistication you can only hope a premier ballerina will perform. If you love ballet you will be dazzled. Brava!\n\nThe plot is vastly better than the musical play. I saw the play and thought there was not any plot to it. And I am not alone in that. But the addition of the protagonist Victoria solves that problem. Other cats explain to her what and why things are the way they are. Most importantly, the significance of the climactic scene, the Jellicle Ball. I got it! And it's good.\n\nI could go on but I will summarize by saying great choreography and performance by everyone. The acting is superior by the pros, especially by the incomparable veterans Judy Dench and Ian McKellen. Jennifer Hudson delivers the performance of a lifetime singing \"Memories\". I wasn't as impressed by the acting of the headline singers but they aren't professional actors.\n\nThe commonly complained about costumes did not bother me. Cats have tails so I don't see anything wrong with them having tails. But I am thankful they decided at the last minute to edit out all the butts. Nobody wants to see that.\n\nI will close with a bit of a joke. Taylor Swift's costume was a bit disturbing as is widely talked about. I was felling things I should not feel.
