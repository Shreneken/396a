            "content": "Parasite (2023)\nBy: Elizabeth Stinson\n\tI just finished watching parasite for the second time and will review it. This movie is about two types of classes, the rich and the poor. The movie includes thrilling moments, and it is filled with social commentary. The film is filled with comedy and drama, then ends with a thriller. The parasite is a 2019 South Korean black comedy thriller directed by Bong Joon-ho. This film has achieved many rewards with outstanding directing, writing, and the best picture. \n\tParasite takes place in recent times in South Korea about social classes on different sides. The Kim family lives in a semi-basement and struggles to even eat food at night so they begin to take odd jobs. The family picks up jobs at a rich family home the mom is a housekeeper, the daughter is an art therapy teacher, the son is a tutor, and the dad is a driver. In order to get these jobs the family had to fire the recent workers. The family does everything they can in order to earn money to keep themselves afloat.\n\tThe family keeps their identities hidden. There's long as I can order to better themselves. they came to the family face a tragedy, leaving their home a mess and facing a new problem now. It shows the difference between the two classes and what each class struggles with. While the Kemp family is struggling with keeping their home alive and each other while the other family does not seem to have many struggles. \n     After re-watching it for the second time I was more aware of things I didn't see the first time. The Rich, dad, Park Dong-ik talks about not \"crossing the line.\" I relished that he doesn't like when people below him get too close to him. Even when the old housekeeper, Moon- gwang, had to wake up the rich mom, Yeon-Kyon, she barely got close to her and then immediately stepped back. Simple things like that stuck out to me that I didn't see the first time.\n     This film was entertaining, but at some point, I did catch myself getting on my phone and watching that instead. I was waiting for a big plot or something crazy to happen, but they didn't happen till the very end. Other than that it was enjoyable, and I watched the whole thing twice and was able to make it through the whole thing, but it wasn't as entertaining as I would like it to be. It had a deep meaning and a good story overall. I love the actors in the movie they are in a lot of other shows I watch so it was enjoyable, watching them act. The house was also very pretty in the setting overall. The view from the house was beautiful and I wish I could look out that every single day. \n     This film shows the difference between the poor and the rich. While one family is struggling to keep food on the table and survive the other one is traveling and doing whatever their hearts desire not caring about others. \n     Any person can enjoy this movie, even a fellow K-drama lover, like myself. It can fit anyone's needs for a good movie watch. I wouldn't recommend anyone not to view it because I believe anyone could enjoy it no matter what kind of movies you like. All in all, I would give it a 7 out of 10 stars.",

They seem to be self-reliant on the hype they generate, that somehow should be enough to reassure us, they'll leave us with an unforgettable memory.\n\nSo while this movie isn't bad and technically well-made, it is far from unforgettable. It's heavy-handed and pushes the device of the screwball comedy far enough to make its subversion and consequent transformation into carnage, less plausible. A mechanism very dear to French director Francois Ozon, who Bong Joon-ho seems to be definitely indebted to.\n\nA movie that certainly pleases the crowds with its grotesque and cynical satire and its deliberate use of violence. \nTo quote Calvino:\n\"What many consider to be the vitality of the times - noisy, aggressive, revving and roaring - belongs to the realm of death, like a cemetery for rusty old cars.\"",

When the impoverished Kim family cleverly inserts itself into the wealthy Park family, life for both families spirals out of control, resulting in unimaginable chaos and horror.  Parasite is a film truly unlike any other, an ingeniously plotted nightmare that works as both an art film and entertainment for the masses.  Bong Joon Ho, a master of visuals, frames and blocks every shot meticulously.  Humor is perfectly balanced with suspense, all while remaining faithful to his theme.  Parasite is one of the best films of the 21st century, if not the best.",

Ho understands this family, allowing them to be the parasites' of the film while also commenting on why they have to work this way. It's always lovely when a film has terrifying given circumstances and Ho is constantly raising the stakes, especially in the middle— where the family learns that their plan is pointless. Ho's knowledge of genre allows him to play into the terror of surprise, and once we learn that secret— the pieces fall rapidly like the torrential rain that floods this family's semi-basement home.",

On the other hand, Bong Joon-Hu became an international creator with his excellent Snowpiercer from 2013, so the criteria should be in line with that fact.\nThe film is at first indisputably interesting to watch, drinkable, extraordinarily driven. It is placed between comedy, drama and thriller, intelligently refusing to classify itself, as well as engaging in a deeper understanding of social problems, avoiding to take sides with either of the two families portrayed in the film from the two ends of the social ladder, so that it cleverly made the culmination as interesting as possible.\n\nIt will undoubtedly be awarded with some Oscars, except for acting, because there is no reason for that. But there is also no reason to emphasize the over-originality of the story itself, ie. screenplay, because the critics seem to have forgotten the masterpiece of the 1964 French director and screenwriter Rene Clement's \"Joy House\" (aka \"The Cage of Love\") with Alain Delon and Jane Fonda. The main thrust of Joon-Hu's film is taken from the title, with the motives and plot of the love affair being transferred to the social sphere, which of course is so modern today, but in that case it is somewhat hypocritical not to give a simultaneous and deeper analysis, for the sake of mere viewability and commercial reasons.\n\n Also, in addition to the many other banalities used in the plot, communicating with the Morse Code as presented in the film could also include it in science fiction genre.\n\n Since Hollywood has not been bothered by originality before (just remember the \"contribution\" in directing of the 2015 award-winning plagiarism \"The Revenant\"), there is no reason not to repeat the situation again this year.",

The movie had a good enough plot to draw me in, but it became predictable after a while. As soon as I realized its predictability, it became quite boring, and don't even get me started with its \"twist.\" There was always something shady about the maid, mostly because we knew a bit about everyone else besides her, so I knew she wasn't just a maid.\n\n The basement is the movie's biggest plot hole. I think that's because, if a wealthy South Korean bought a house, wouldn't they have one as their first concern? During the film's twist, Mun-Kwang mentions exactly what I said, even mentioning the creditors, but then he goes on to say: \"Maybe Mr. Namgoong felt embarrassed about building such a room. He didn't mention it to the Parks when he sold the house.\" The conclusion here strikes me as lazy.\n\nA major concern people have with this film is the message it conveys. It conveys that rich people have a perfect life, a life of innocence and gullibility. Rich people aren't as innocent as they appear from what I have seen from the majority of rich people. Their gullibility is a result of believing everything the Kim Family tells them. Yes, it's said they will take anyone who gets recommended by a friend after talking to them, interviewing them, perhaps asking for some papers, and then believing them. People who are rich often feel they don't have all the money in the world, and they need more money to live a happy life. \n\nIt seems absurd to me to think that way. There is always a tendency for someone to exaggerate when recommending someone to another person. It would be impossible to truly know this person, even in the interview, if they were not exaggerating when they were being interviewed, and they may have some past job offers and great school degrees, but how would you trust someone being recommended to you?\n\nIt's truly disgusting how they convey that poor people will do whatever it takes to survive, even drive themselves to murder, which isn't the solution to their problem. Regardless of whether it's seen through the lens of a foreign country's economics, it  shouldn't be portrayed at all.\n\nThe ending really rubs me in the wrong way with just a straight up killing spree. The motives of all the characters' are all over the place, but this is by far the worst ending coming behind Spiral, just for its shock value.",

The twists kept me on the edge of my seat, while the dark humor rubbed salt in my wounds.

In other words, I've seldom been so impressed by the first 3 acts of a movie, or so let down by the last 2. \n\nWhat makes the movie initially so charming is the crisp, fairy-tale structure of the plot, offering glimmers of hope that maybe, just maybe, filmmakers have rediscovered the art of storytelling. The Kim family's takeover of a palatial hillside home, or at least the downstairs bit, is a joy to behold. It follows relentless patterns of connivance and insinuation, as when the old housekeeper is let go for seeming to stain a handkerchief with tubercular blood. No problem: Mrs. Kim, with a helpful reference from a daughter posing as an \"art therapist,\" is right on hand to fill the spot. \n\nDespite the folktale vibe, there's plenty of nuance too. We are not invited to simply pity the destitute Kims or to despise the complacent Parks. Somewhere midway through, Mr. Kim shares his life's store of wisdom with his son: planning things out is a waste of time, and whatever happens, happens. What can you do? With such a patriarch, it's not hard to see how the Kims have made themselves desperately poor. Equally reprehensible is the Kims' outlook toward the Parks, whom they dehumanize as gullible marks.  Meanwhile, the Parks are presented as clean, organized, and essentially decent. Mrs. Park, despite her emotional imbalance, is particularly winsome, and you flinch when the Kims call her an idiot behind her back. \n\nUnfortunately, all of this nuance is lost by the end. Other reviews have pointed out the richly metaphorical nature of the movie, but I would add that the metaphors fall like a rain of bricks. In seeing Mr. Kim, hired as a chauffeur, forced to don an Indian headdress for a birthday party, we are to associate him with the oppressed peoples of the world. In seeing his neighborhood flooded with sewage after heavy rains, we are to understand that the very structure of the world keeps him wallowing in filth. And when, while Mrs. Park is driven on a lengthy shopping tour, we see her feet stretched toward the front seat alongside Mr. Kim's face, we are to gather that he is at the family's mercy. This kind of ham-fistedness reveals the severe limits of socialist comprehension; it cannot really get at the human condition. \n\nWhen the story ends in a bloodbath, you know it's gone off the rails in a bad way. It's not merely the loss of structure or the conflation of genres that bothers me; it's the draining of expansiveness and humanity.",

Bong Joon-Ho, nos adentra en un viaje cautivador tomando como base un tema tan serio como lo es la lucha de clases sociales, y que oportunamente decora con una chispa de humor negro y ácido que le cae como anillo al dedo; no pende de ser políticamente correcta o ocasionalmente ser acrimoniosa para ser una experiencia lisonjera, es un contraste de emociones tremendo que mezcla distintos géneros, por ejemplo, los primeros 60 minutos están compuestos de un drama bastante satírico, para luego en la segunda hora llenarse de suspenso o incluso llegar a evocar el terror, que finalmente cierra con un slasher que culmina en un final melodramático que seguramente te sacará una lágrima, todo acompañado de un exquisito humor complejo y una profunda crítica social, o si es menester llamarle así, una sátira, que supongo es más eso que otra cosa. Pasando al aspecto técnico, estoy seguro que en un futuro se le dará el título de ''estéticamente significativa'' por la simple y textual razón de que su estética es una belleza, la escenografía es de las mejores que he visto en mucho tiempo, y que se acopla a la cámara y la luz para formar una augusta composición cinematográfica que cautiva con excelentes tomas, la dirección es magistral obviamente, y las interpretaciones son cómicas, desgarradoras, creíbles y epopéyicas, creando personajes entrañables y paralelamente despreciables que le hacen honor al título de la película; y ni hablo del guion porque me alargaría demasiado, además que ya he dicho lo que tenía que decir de este; solo me quedaría añadir un detalle personal y es que esta reflexiva cinta se ha convertido en mi favorita junto con ''pozos de ambición'' a la que no dejo de echarle flores, y que fácilmente podría pensar en apuntarle un merecido diez; es una cinta multipremiada(ganadora por voto unánime de la palma de oro en Cannes, y cinco premios óscar incluyendo mejor película) que me ha hecho reír y llorar. nota: 9,8/10.",

The cinematography is award-winning that helps support the main theme through the use of its unbelievable camera angles and lighting.

Truthfully though, this dichotomy does create a substantial mismatch with the early depiction of them as substantially lazy, intoxicated underachievers, that can't consistently even fold boxes with any consistency, who suddenly and miraculously pull 'smart choices', and super-spy-level skills and talents out of seeming 'nowhere'. \n\nI think it misses somewhat in the 'capitalism is the problem' angle, widely pitched, as the Kims are clearly very capable and motivated, and can achieve amazing things, when they apply themselves, but seem to have arrived at their semi-basement apartment - and their lifestyle of sitting around folding pizza boxes - through utter lack of motivation and rampant inertia. \n\nRecommended, just not as satisfying as I'd hoped.",

Honestly, I normally wouldn't have made it through that first hour, but surely SOMETHING mind blowing was coming right?\nWell, not really. The rest of the movie was quite gripping at times. I really felt for the father of the poor family when he murdered the father of the rich family. That was Avery powerful scene.\nSo add up a barely mediocre first half with a really good, but not great second half, and.., I don't get it? Is there something I'm missing here?",

The film is multilayered and universal in its themes but may lose some nuisance in the narrative screenplay due to its translation and being ingrained in Korean culture. People leeching off of others is apparent. The social commentary here is blatant. Karma is a thing. But what I felt resonated most was the importance of family. The theme continuously appears throughout this film without you even realising but is ultimately driven home in the final scenes. Bong Joon Ho has constructed a modern film that hits the current zeitgeist of today, but in a way that will not become dated. Parasite is a weave of dark tones, intrigue, mystery, and humour, and is the pinnacle of modern international cinema today.",

The intestines scenes showed the struggles and determinations that the lower class had in order to climb up the society. Through the conversations, we had a maddening look at the differences between the two social classes, and how fed up one can feel. The use of symbolism was brilliant and subtle, which made the script even more masterful.\n\nOverall, arguably Bong Joon-Ho's best work. 9.5/10",

I like the mother, she's sassy and doesn't give a damn to speak her mind. Wow, that place is like a fortress. It's so beautiful, pristine like a palace. It looks like it doesn't even belong in the city. Something's kind of fishy with this huge house and it's inhabitants and I'm very curios as to what happens. I've noticed from watching several Korean movies, that they have a really good sense of humor. Almost very random and unexpected when it happens. \n\nThe madame is quite attractive, she's cute. She's also very lively and has a great sense of humor. Hmm, that wall illuminating all the dishes and kitchen ware seems important, very interesting. These poor kids are really street smart, what they lack in wealth, they may up for with wits and grit. Fake it till you make it I guess is their motto. Wow, I don't know what to think about this poor family. Their motives and their plan is quite diabolical. They've basically gotten rid of all the help the rich family had. They even got rid of the housekeeper who seemed like a nice older lady. They seem kind of scum baggy to me, they're scummy people. I'm beginning to think that this poor family isn't a family at all and maybe they like work for the same company or person or something? \n\nDude wtf is going on? Lol! There's this underground room where the old housekeeper's husband is living down there? Dude this is so fucking weird. I can't believe they got away with that escape. Holy shit, that was butt clenching. It's at this moment that the movie shifts into a completely different direction and even changes in mood and genre becoming more of a thriller/horror.\n\nIt seems like the main theme is this movie is lies and deception. What you see, isn't really what you get and you can't really trust just about anyone, even if they're recommended by a reliable source. It's very odd to watch unfold, but this poor family has basically integrated themselves into the lives of this rich family. I guess they're all parasites feeding off this rich family. I don't know why but now I feel like the rich family is going to do something unexpected. I feel like there's going to be some kind of fucked up twist that's going to happen. They were the stink bugs all along, the lower class, the poor. There was a lot of twisted moments from both families.\n\nBeautifully filmed. The cinematography and compositions are impeccable. A feat of technical perfection. Brilliantly and cleverly written. Masterfully executed and filled with plenty of beautiful symbolism and metaphors. My only problem with the movie is that it's hard to relate to any of the characters since they're all essentially parasites and they all have really scummy characteristics to them, both the poor and the rich families. I guess I could relate the most to the rich families son and daughter. Watching this movie movie was something very exciting and thrilling, I didn't know what to expect next. I would definitely watch this movie again.",

            "content": "This film begins with the image of a pile of socks drying near the narrow window of Ki-Taek's house. He lives on an \"intermediate floor\", a kind of basement whose view overlooks a trash can where a homeless person urinates. The four family members are constantly dirty, moving between cramped rooms as they search for a free Wi-Fi network in the neighborhood. The description of this family is grotesque, just as the bourgeois description of the Park family will be grotesque. The latter inhabit the spacious house created by a famous architect, where the four members are scattered around the rooms and get bored with all the technology and objects at their disposal. The two cores are identical opposites (father, mother, daughter and son), like the reflection of a mirror.\nDirector Bong Joon-ho moves on to a caricature view of the social classes, whose stratification is represented by the literal structure of the houses - see the rich man's house, the poor's middle floor and a basement, an even more precarious level that will play an important role in the plot. While the Park's wealth makes them naive and ignorant (no curiosity for the world around them due to the ease of their possessions), the protagonists' poverty motivates trickery, the ability to create all possible tricks to ascend socially. It does not take long before families meet and the unemployed manage to infiltrate the wealthy house, one by one, gaining the trust of new employers. The notion of parasitism suggested by the title works perfectly to describe the central conflict.\nThe first half of the narrative is a delightful comic farce. The plans devised by father (Song Kang-ho), mother (Chang Hyae-jin), daughter (Park So-dam) and son (Choi Woo-sik) are as simple as they are hilarious, working only thanks to the Park's innocence. The director is not deprived of creating really exaggerated scenes, betting on physical humor and the blows of destiny that contribute to the success of the mission. The viewer needs to show a high degree of indulgence to believe in some of the twists and turns, as well as certain elements of suspense introduced along the way. Joon-ho is much more interested in the symbolic value of the actions and characters than in the verisimilitude of the plot, which becomes an allegorical fable of ants and cicadas, foxes and chickens.\nFortunately, as suspense sets in, Parasite takes the precaution of expanding the social scope and visiting other families in a situation as precarious as that of the protagonists. This is the time to reveal the different ways of dealing with difficulties, so that the parasitism of Ki-Taek and her family is not seen as the only possible way out. The flood scene proves to be particularly effective in affecting the lower floors while preserving the upper floors. Aesthetically, the project demonstrates the pragmatic elegance of the director, who never sacrifices understanding in the name of beauty. The filmmaker proves an excellent mastery of tones, directing the scribe, the touching drama and the dark suspense in different, yet organic and permeable ways.\nFinally, it is not surprising that the narrative leads to tragedy. The script sees violence as the only possible outcome for the clash between extreme poverty and ostentatious wealth, between the boss's hypocritical education (who even likes the employees, despite having a \"subway smell\") and the restrained aggressiveness of the employees. The film builds a time bomb, accentuating differences and social injustices until it explodes in a bloody climax. In this way, it allegorically represents the class struggle, the ideas of possession and appropriation in the contemporary era. It is commendable that the text dedicates a privileged space for cell phones, \"gourmet balconies\", the back rooms - so many elements representative of the times in which we live.\nWhen the son is faced with a serious problem, he tries to put himself in the place of the rich friend: \"What would Min do in this situation?\", he asks. Her sister replies: \"Min would never be in this situation\". Perhaps this is the best summary of the tragicomic discourse, according to which social mobility is an illusion, and Hollywood dreams of affective reconciliation between rich and poor deserve to be ridiculed. For a family to occupy the Park home, the ultimate symbol of success, it is necessary for another family to leave, even if it is by force. To ascend to the top of the pyramid, the only way is war.",

            "content": "Normally I'm not much into Korean entertainment. The only Korean entertainment I have ever consumed is PUBG. So I didn't know what to expect when I begun watching this film. I saw it with a blank slate, with no preformed opinion whatsoever. The only time I had seen a Korean film before was The Train to Busan, and that too is made by Bong Joon-Ho. I had watched it from somewhere in the middle when it was coming on TV. So in a way we can consider this is the first Korean film that I watched.\n\nParasite is a film that makes us feel uncomfortable on purpose. It makes us think what we will do in a situation like this. The Kim family is in a desparate need of money, and the son in the house gets a fake degree to teach at a rich family's house. He learns about the whole family and slowly manipulates the mistress of the house into hiring his other family members over there. Afterwards the family starts getting the already existing servants fired over false accusations and completely takes over the house.\n\nThings don't go too well for the Kim family, as one day they decide to live in the mansion while the Park family is away. And then the previous cook comes back and finds out that all of them are the members of the same family. To hide this, they fight and accidentally kill her, and it's at that very moment the Park family comes back.nThey had to hide under their table for the night and then find the perfect opportunity to escape. Later at Dae-Woo's birthday the cook's husband comes out of his hiding and kills Ki-Jung. The family is completely separated, with Ki-Taek hiding in the same basement where the cook's husband was hiding\n\nThe only part about this film I don't like is when Ki-Taek kills Mr Park. There are many people defending this part saying that it was the last straw and that Ki-Taek had no more control over his emotions, but this scene would have made sense only if either Ki-Taek was shown to be mentally unstable from the beginning, or if Mr Park hated Ki-Taek for some really deep reason other than his body smell. Nothing justifies his this act. But other than that I liked everything about this movie - the uneasy feelings that it was able to invoke, the acting, the dialogues, the story most of all, everything is phenomenal.\n\nParasite completely lives up to being the Oscar winner that it is. Although it's for a mature audience, I won't mind showing it to someone who hasn't watched it already. It's a masterpiece that deserves the popularity it got and Bong Joon-Ho shall be remembered for it for days to come.",

Another thing very well expressed in the movie are the selfishness of the dominant class, when after the man hided in the basement be killed, all the boss have to say is about the \"poor smell\" of the man that had just lost his life. Also, the movie handles very well that belonging to the dominant class brings some symbols, as the rich family daugher's access to foreign language classes, and the youngest son's access to art classes. And, in addition, rely on the services of more than one domestic employee. My only reservation about the movie is that it's history would be better exploited if it proposed a collective response to the social inequality, and not as response to it the social ascension of few people, which is desired by the poor family soon. That way, he would save his father that stayed at the rich house's basement. Finally, the actor's performances and the script are very well directed, knowing when to give the drama tone or even the comedy tone, when it was necessary.",

            "content": "THE PERFECT DECEIT\n\n\nEvery now and then a phenomenon appears in the world. The movie world is no exception. I know that the Oscars are one of the most popular events, but let's be honest, everyone who is even a bit interested in the beauty of cinema knows well that the Cannes festival really awards world-class works. For example, last year's winner of the festival \"Parasite\". After watching the movie myself I understood why. Bong Joon-ho is distinguished by extraordinary originality in his movies. \"Snowpiercer\" or ‘Okja' are pure evidence that this director never repeats himself. He will always surprise us with a new story, completely different from the others, with something astounding about it. His new work \"Parasite\" also belongs to this canon, but this time Bong Joon-Ho presents us with a story that surpasses all previous sensational achievements of the Korean. \n\nThis should be a review, not a spoiler, so I will try to describe the plot of this masterpiece as simple as possible. Let's start with the fact that the main characters are a poor Korean family (parents and two young adult children) living in a musty basement. The movie starts with a great misfortune, the wi-fi password was changed in a local area and the family loses access to the Internet. At some point we can all relate to this little ‘catastrophe'. Sooner or later thanks to a friend's recommendation the family's son, finds a job as an English tutor to a teenage girl from a wealthy family. He quickly starts implementing a plan that will allow him to get his sister and parents to work for the rich. At this point, it felt like the entire movie was supposed to be a comedy of contrasting poor and rich families, and seeing the poor struggling to stay afloat. But don't worry the movie is about more than that.\n\nMost of the things that happen as the story unfolds are unpredictable. The unconventional creator doesn't give everything up on the plate right away. Parasite starts off as a comedy, we have a lot of black humor here, incredible plot twists, the scenes are erratic and the tension keeps growing. It is impossible to guess what's going to happen at the very end or even in the next few moments. And on top of all this, Bong Joon-Ho shows us one of the biggest issues of the world: the differences between rich and poor. \n\nNot only the script and direction in Parasite is excellent. The whole thing looks great in every possible way. The shots and music are a real feast for the senses, and the way the camera is operated makes us get to know the Park house like our own pocket. In addition, we also get a small look on a poor Korean town, which in my opinion may interest the European viewer. Also the cast of this movie did a stunning job. \n\nParasite is told in a modern, poetic, light and daring way. This piece of art devours the spectator, does not cause any problems with assimilation, and at the same time is an absolutely refined work at the highest level. In my opinion everyone should watch this movie. It hides a lot of variety that you will not notice at first glance. It has an intriguing story, combines humor with seriousness and the both family's cannot be seen as good or bad. \"Parasite\" is an extremely courageous movie that touches on social stratification, and it does it in a daring manner it amuses and moves. Bong again provided great entertainment for us.",

This is a movie release since 2019 but I watched it during the pandemic last year I would say this is another few Korean movies that I want to give a high evaluation. \n              The plot of the film revolves around a poor family and a rich family. At the beginning of the movie, the focus is on a Kim family of four in the basement of Seoul. Mom and dad are unemployed, kids are out of school. One day, Kim family's son was hired to be a tutor for the daughter of a rich family, Park Family and then he tried to let his family pretend as the highly qualified person and they successfully parasitized in the rich family while the rich family is quite unaware.\nThis is a very novel movie. The plot of the movie is quite different from what I have seen before. It can make reflected modern society and let people thought-provoking. In this movie, no one is a one hundred percent perfect angle or a full demon everyone using obscure means but they just wanted to achieve their goals. There's a lot of contrast and reversal in the movie. The plot is very compact, with many unexpected developments. The contrast between the dark and the light side, the contrast between the mansion and the basement, and so on. There are a lot of details to savor, and maybe a few more. I enjoy all the actor's performance they do a great job in emphasizing the little nuances which make each of the personalities unique and I would say there is no redundant lens. In this film each scene, in the beginning, is the preparation for the following plot.\nAt the end of the movie, \"the poor\" finally becomes \"the rich\" and leads a good life through their efforts, but all this is imagined by \"the poor\". Maybe the reality is so cruel, many things, imagine is very good, but no action, no effort, it will never become true. If you can only watch one movie I'm extremely recommended this wonderful masterpiece for you, this Plame d'Or winner of the Cannes Film Festival sure does not disappoint you.",

Although the plot that reflects social inequality might make it feel hard to understand, the movie is presented simply and straightforwardly. I love that the movie takes the issue of social inequality to the core of the story. The film runs by asking us to ask questions in our minds throughout the story: who is the real \"parasite class\"? The rich or the poor? Or do we all have parasites inside ourselves? The film clearly shows the main point of the story from character quotes, character actions and symbolic expressions. More than that, in terms of production, it is good as well. Every point of view, color grading, or even sound effects are meaningful and exciting which make the audience more involved with the movie even more. \nIn the first part of the story, the story begins gradually, allowing the viewer to get to know the characters mixed with black comedy that reflects the social system of inequality. But at the end of the story runs in a different direction from the first. There is something more exciting and thrilling. Overall, it's still a really great movie and a really good script. Because the movie takes on heavy issues such as class and social inequality to make it more understandable. At the end of the story the audiences can answer the questions that the villain of the story is not the poor or the rich, but the social inequality that makes people be a villain.",

His grip (as well as co-screenwriter Han Jin-won) on the story, characters, settings, and actions is unrivaled in its deceptive simplicity that belies an intense, impeccably-crafted, undeniably compelling complexity that treats its characters with wit, cunning, and intelligence. Song Kang-ho is phenomenally powerful in his supporting role, with other standout performances coming from Cho Yeo-jeong, Choi Woo-shik, and Park So-dam. Razor-sharp cinematography, eye-catching production design, and a wonderfully flavorful musical score add significantly to what is already a profoundly affecting, narratively singular experience. A perfect blend of dark humor, trenchant social commentary, popcorn thrills, and emotional poignancy, Parasite is not only the best film of 2019, not only one of the best films of the decade, but, as its characters attempt to accomplish, an entry into the upper echelon of all-time greats and classics.",

            "content": "Doing my best to keep this spoiler free, I would say that the film is watchable and it's probably worth seeing if only for social reasons as it does crop up here and there is most of my social circles that include movie fans.\n\nThe plot centres on the misfortunes of a family and their ability to take advantage of their son getting his foot in the door of a lucrative opportunity. It's then a story of how things can escalate when you get into a situation you aren't in control of to begin with and the stakes keep raising. There are no glaring problems with the plot or characters, unless (I'm told) you happen to be familiar with South Korean culture. And the film does a decent job of making you care about most of the characters in it as it appropriately develops most of the characters in it so you can understand them as people.\n\nThe problem comes in when you really start to pay attention to the characters and the decisions that they make. At it's core it poses the assumption that if you give someone an inch, they will take a mile. Which isn't unreasonable, until I add in that the mile would include driving over people, friends included, then it's a whole lot less reasonable and is only believable if we are talking about psychopaths.\n\nIn the same way while the situation might initially seem understandable you are doomed if you ever ask yourself the question; but would you? If you and your family were in a desperate situation would you risk it all for more when the chance of you getting busted is actually pretty high? Probably not. If you were to seemingly succeed, would you repeat the process? Well, maybe since you were daft enough to try it again, but really, why would you? The film makes no effort to explain why they keep choosing to escalate the situation when they seem to move out of the most desperate situation immediately after acquiring the first opportunity, which was given to them legitimately. Instead they plough ahead taking risk after risk, then pretty soon the characters seem to forget how precarious their position is and make several obviously terrible decisions which act as a catalyst for further escalating situations. Culminating into an entirely avoidable situation.\n\nThe biggest problem of all is that the means they use to go about setting up these further opportunities draw attention to how wicked they are as people and really sets you against them despite their own struggles. You then spend much of the film rooting for them to fail as much as you are hoping for everything to turn out alright, because although they were clearly desperate, it's equally apparent that they are bad people who don't hesitate to put other people in a situation as desperate as they have been in, so long as it's not them. I get the sense that this is supposed to be a duality within the film, but when one side completely overpowers the other, it doesn't work at all. The various bad circumstances that afflict the characters in no way comes even close to justifying their actions against others and just cements that fact that they are people who ultimately deserve to lose.\n\nThat being said, the acting, which I have seen criticised, isn't bad. It's not Hollywood A-list but then placing that kind of expectation on them is unreasonable and they easily outperform some actors/actresses in Hollywood who have had repeated work in the industry. The music is perfectly crafted to enhance the experience and it's clear no expense nor effort was sparing in the sets. It's an experience that is only harmed by how obscene the choices the characters make and keep making.\n\nWhile you are watching you could become engrossed enough to forget these kinds of details and considerations, and if you can do that you will enjoy it. If you have an eye for the particulars however, Parasite is fundamentally no different from a B-list horror movie where the situation only happens because of continued awful decisions on the part of the main cast. I don't feel that this fundamentally a bad movie, despite how much I may have gone on about its flaws, but it's not something you are every likely to watch twice and I seriously doubt it's something that will be remembered as anything other than 'that foreign film that won best picture that one time'",

            "content": "This thriller from South Korea shocked the world in 2020 when it became the first non-English language film to win the Oscar for Best Picture. The plot of the film is also one where you wouldn't necessarily think it would appeal to the Academy: a poor family of four living in the underground struggles to survive. When the son gets the opportunity to work for a very wealthy family, their situation suddenly turns around. As a result, events turn upside down.\n\nContrary to other mainstream films, in which the main - supporting scheme is usually clearly followed through, in Parasite the entire cast shines at the same high level. All of them act in absolute top form and give their so different characters that certain something. If you had to pick a stand out, it would be Kim Ki-taek as the father of the poor family. His performance is subtle and funny for long stretches, but once he comes out of his shell, he impresses with a lot of wisdom and unpredictability. But the real hero of the film is director Bong Joon Ho. Known in his home country for years as a borderline brilliant filmmaker, he has given Parasite an aura that few could replicate. Not only is the ensemble of actors spot-on, but everything else, from the stirring music to the beautiful set designs and well-chosen dialogue, he has done everything right with this film.\n\nParasite's success should never have come as a big surprise. Bong Joon Ho's masterpiece is one of the most complete films of recent years. Especially the fact that the film initially resembles a comedy and only then lives up to its actual genre of thriller is a unique approach. In parallel, there is also the influence of other genres, such as drama, mystery and even some action. It remains to mention the social criticism that Parasite tries to communicate over its entire 134 minutes. The class differences in South Korea are portrayed very well. Sometimes discreetly, but mostly transparently and very clearly.  This is especially thought-provoking when you watch the film repeatedly and become more aware of this fact. Wonderfully acted, grandiose direction and many genres colliding - Parasite is perfect and rightly the best film of 2020!",

            "content": "Parasite is undoubtedly a masterpiece. Releasing on 7th February in the United Kingdom, Parasite has taken the world by storm, and for good reasons. This thriller/comedy is a marvel of modern cinema and undoubtedly one of the best films of the decade, with it already having deservingly won over 13 awards - even breaking Oscar history by taking home 4 awards in one night. \n\nParasite (directed by Bong Joon-ho) follows the lives of the Kim family, showing the harsh realities of living in poverty and the slums of the city. The son, Ki-woo (portrayed by Choi Woo-shik), becomes the leader of the movement in his family to improve their life after being given a symbol of luck by a family friend. Ki-woo takes over as an English tutor for the Park family – a rich, powerful household who the Kims are able to leech off of in order to work their way up in society. The naïve head-of-household Mrs Park (Cho Yeo-jeong) is soon blindsided by the entirety of the Kim family, as their plans to remove the original workers of the household unfold successfully. Up until this point, Parasite appears to be quite a light-hearted film, however, things soon take a turn for the unexpected. \n\nUpon watch, it is clear why this film has so quickly been treasured by the majority of those that have seen it. Details as small as the film being separated by two specific acts are the reason it is so successful as a movie. It provides twists and turns that are almost impossible to predict for even the most keen-eyed viewers and film critics, even switching the entire genre of the movie when you least expect it. The transition between comedy and thriller is seamless and makes for extremely easy viewing, as two hours pass by without hesitation or a wanting for the film to hurry up at any point. A strong point of this movie is definitely the way the events are laid out. In most movies where action or horror takes place, we see this theme and set of sequences being dragged out across the entirety of the movie, often making it repetitive and occasionally boring after it having been shown already. Parasite however, successfully places the ‘action' throughout the film in specific places. These points of conflict or climax are skillfully placed to ensure that they don't become meaningless throughout the course of the film. \n\nAnother point of discussion is the soundtrack of this cinematic wonder – more specifically the opening theme of the movie. Although the song is a simple piece on piano, it becomes very symbolic of the film as a whole, especially after watching it and then revisiting the song. The theme consists of an upwards ladder of notes, perhaps representing the climb the Kim's attempt to make in society through the Parks, with the Kims living in the slums and the Parks in uptown luxury. With a main image in this movie being stairs, it's no wonder why this song has been made similar to a climbing sound; ideas of climbing up the social ladder, with those high up in society being above and those lower are below. Despite being a simple piece, the emotions it can draw out of those that truly listen to it are powerful and I encourage all that have seen this movie to give this song another listen. Along with the main theme, Parasite's entire soundtrack is able to perfectly capture the tonal shifts of the film and add to the overall effect of some of its most powerful scenes. \n\nIf you haven't seen Parasite already, I highly implore you to do so and hope that these common praises of the film encourage you further. This movie is one of the rare cases where a film is clearly going to be the best for years to come and be something to stick with you as a significant moment in cinematic history. Being the first foreign film in history to win Best Picture at the Oscars (and deservedly so), Parasite truly is a masterpiece of modern cinema and should be what people take notes on when asking how to make cinematic history. A tragicomic that is impossible to forget, Parasite receives 5 stars – a movie I believe will remain a classic for decades to come.",

In the process of viewing, only one thought was spinning in my head... they did not live richly, and it was not worth starting. People, of course, are shown not from the most pleasant side, real parasites! Why don't they understand that you need to learn, work, and achieve. How can one benefit from the benefits of others? Does this make you successful? How can you use someone else's kindness? Get right under your skin? How unpleasant it all is... You can talk about this endlessly, it is better to look at it yourself and draw your own conclusions.\nI must say that the film itself turned out to be very high-quality, the situation is correct, everything looks realistic. Well done creators! I definitely recommend the movie to watch, there is something to think about. A decent movie!\n\nWhat is this picture about? A very poor family lives in a basement, barely making ends meet. None of this family can get a normal job. But, one day, a friend of his son offers a part-time job in a decent house. A rich family needs an English tutor. This is a real gift of fate! But this was not enough... Okay, I won't write a spoiler and recommend this movie to everyone !",

It starts off as somewhat of \"Catch me if you can\" but without cops and later turns out to be a very deep and interesting thriller with just too many twists.These plot twists are stacked together so well, that there is barely any plot holes, at least I didn't notice any. The ending of this movie is truly shocking and unexpected, as well as the emotions characters are showing in it are superb. I have never felt so involved in the plot for the last year. The camera angles are beautiful and modern looking. Colors are wonderful and the movie is very pleasing to watch.

It wasn't at all what I had assumed it would be like, it has a much more comedic side to it than I was expecting - and that's a positive. Yet, it's still pretty dark. It's a great mix. The plot is one that is very entertaining to see play out - the ending is particularly nuts.\n\nThe cast do a fantastic job, especially the main quartet. Song Kang-ho would be my personal standout, I enjoyed watching him throughout. Choi Woo-shik is very good too, as are Park So-dam and Jang Hye-jin.

He strung together an incredibly well made film. I loved all the juxtapositions between the families, and I enjoyed the subtle imagery (well sometimes not so subtle). While the plot is a bit absurd, Bong Joon-ho suspends my disbelief. Once again props to him.\n\nEvery scene is well crafted and serves a meaningful purpose to the story, and all the play with lighting really aids it.\n\nThe only reason I took off half a star is due to the final act of the film. It is forced fed to us, unlike the rest of them film which everything is dynamic. I did enjoy the bleak message of the ending. \n\nOverall, one of the best films I've seen in a long time.

And one of those films where the idea of watching a bunch of unlikeable, fairly unredeemable, immoral people is somehow considered enjoyable just because...it's shocking? What? 18 year olds in art college make \"shocking films\" just because there is this weird idea in our creative culture that says if you do something \"shocking\" JUST to shock, you are valuable and entertaining. I don't agree. There has to be more substance behind it, rather than just that 18-year-old art student vibe of \"look what I'm doing! Aren't I SHOCKING YOU?!\"  I feel like I see through it and a lot of people don't. Oh well.\n\nAlso, the idea that this is intelligent commentary is misleading. The idea that rich are evil and dumb by nature of being rich, and that poor people are simultaneously superior yet completely immoral, villianous heathens is just outdated and weird.  It's not a movie about an empathetic poor family who end up in a gray area and do horrible things that are also kind of justifiable. It's just random shock value with unsympathetic characters that people ate up even though it didn't make any sense. I mean... sure, if you just want to make a SLASHER film, then by all means, do it. But if I don't care about the characters that I'm supposed to, or, you don't even want me to care about the characters, but then expect me to sit through their lives and then call it art... not going to happen. I need emotional investment or at least have the honesty to admit it's just a wild slasher movie. I read an article that South Korea is actually economically doing really well and that this is a misleading representation, anyway. So, there goes the revolutionary commentary out the window. There are so many better foreign films out there. So many better films that comment on wealth inequality or classism.",

Based off the title I thought their would be some crazy epidemic like boon jong hos other movie the host but nope . Just social commentary calling the parasite s poor people which is really clever. This movie is pretty clever in that way and entertaining at times. To get to the good part of the movie it took a good 25 30 minutes. What I mean is the good part is when Kevin is at the house. The acting is amazing. I've never seen a foreign movie to make me interested in the acting. Cause reading subtitles is kinda rough, I know first world problems but still. I know people that will agree with me. Anyway it may seem that I'm hating on this movie but it's very entertaining but would I ever see this movie again, probably not.

I have a legitimate hard time not judging people who liked this movie. You have to enjoy violence, and I don't mean the arcade stormtrooper-zapping kind. I mean you have to enjoy watching meaningless, graphic, up-close-and-personal violence. No, no, don't be all \"but it has mmeeaaaning! it's about class! it's sophisticated!\" no its not, that's a bunch of malarkey.\n\nIf someone gave this unpleasant garbage 5 stars.. I am forced to wonder what would their reaction to other things be? If they went to an ophthalmologist who stabbed their eyes out instead of giving them a new prescription, would they review them as follows: \"Dr. soandso thinks outside of the box, a compelling experience, I couldn't look away, wow!\"\n\nBecause that's what all these reviews look like to me. I don't know what disease of the mind you all have, but this movie is a solid minus 100 stars. It is not only unpleasant to watch, but the \"food for thought\" included is offensive garbage. Quit feeling all sophisticated because you watched a movie where class is a theme. This is just a misery-party, a everyone-sucks buffet. It's not sophisticated. It's a slow burn tension thriller wearing a fancy dress.\n\nI skimmed some of those glowing critic reviews. They pay lip service to the idea that it's about the \"analysis of the disparities between social classes\".. but any fruits to that analysis? No, all the critics move on swiftly from that and prattle on about the tension and the violence and the \"dropping the hammer\" on the audience. Because there's no clever commentary here, the class thing is just a setting.",

However, things turn for the worse when the former housekeeper Gook Moon-gwang (Lee Jung-eun) and her husband Geun-sae (Park Myung-hoon) from downstairs threaten to tell the Parks of their exploitive soliciting, resulting in the Kims sneaking out of the Park house, them losing their home due to a rainstorm, them relocating to a homeless shelter, several family members murdered in a birthday party, Geun-sae fleeing scot free, Kim Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) the patriarch taking shelter in the Park's basement, and Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), the son, dreaming of buying the same upscale house. Putting aside the Oscar's racial overcompensation and its inception as the first foreign language to win Best Picture, this is without a doubt one of the funniest and most clever films I have seen in the past five years. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a fan of the ‘upstairs/downstairs' genre, especially because, aside from the period costumes, I find these shows or movies sluggish and elitist. However, what makes Parasite stand out is that it plays to the inner sadist in both societal merits, allowing for some outlandishly hilarious character-based humor. The Kims are the low-income optimists who dream of moving to an elevation bigger than themselves and the Parks are the naive, money-grabbing, spoiled snobs who rob from the poor and mock their ‘old basement smell'. The movie also combines said humor with the more intense gritty Sam Peckinpah style violence and thought-provoking drama, to a point where the quality of writing goes into Coen Brothers territory. But those moments like the murders at Park Da-song's (Jung Hyeon-jun) party don't shy away from the film's theme of social rivalry and betrayal. So, as far as ‘upstairs/downstairs' movies are concerned, Parasite is probably my favorite. \n\n(4 ⅕ Peach Skin Shavings out of 5)",

Simply describing the central metaphor of Parasite in the way it speaks to the film's theme of the rich-poor divide might make it seem that it's obvious, but it works deliciously. The plot is all sleek, smooth lines akin to the architecture of the house in which most of the film takes places; the metaphor is easy to grasp but never simplistic. Indeed this is one of those rare works of art that neither romanticises the poor nor demonises the rich, and it goes even better by excusing no one from their sins. It also switches genres deftly; from the delicate comedy of the first hour to the comedic drama/thriller of the second half. Other genre tropes are cleverly employed - especially hinting at aspects of horror and science-fiction, nodding more than once to HG Wells' War Of The Worlds amongst others. The film moves gracefully to a conclusion that's startling and that also seems somehow written in the stars; in the hands of an inferior artist it would be schlocky and clumsy; here it simply works as it's intended to. Similarly, the film's epilogue avoids sentimentality and manages to pack an emotional punch. That the film achieves all this within a seamless whole that is at once perfectly constructed but still humane and truthful is the reason is this film is so justly celebrated.",

Especially the use of stairs going up and down, cramped spaces versus lush, open green lawns, delectably and elegantly laid out fruit slices as opposed to a clumisly heaped plate of food from a local kitchen.\nKim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik) and his family live on the edge of poverty. They fold pizza boxes for a delivery company to make some cash, steal wi-fi from the coffee shop nearby, and leave the windows open when the neighborhood is being fumigated to deal with their own infestation. Kim Ki-woo's life changes when a friend offers to recommend him as an English tutor for a girl he's been working with as the friend has to go out of the country for a while. The friend is in love with the young girl and doesn't want another tutor \"slavering\" over her. Why he trusts Kim Ki-woo given what we know and learn about him is a valid question.\n\nThe young man changes his name to Kevin and begins tutoring Park Da-hye , who immediately falls for him, of course. Kevin has a much deeper plan. He's going to get his whole family into this house. He quickly convinces the mother Yeon-kyo, the excellent Jo Yeo-jeong, that the son of the house needs an art tutor, which allows Kevin's sister \"Jessica\" to enter the picture. Before long, mom and dad are in the Park house too, and it seems like everything is going perfectly for the Kim family. The Parks seem to be happy too. And then everything changes.",

It's heavy-handed and pushes the device of the screwball comedy far enough to make its subversion and consequent transformation into carnage, less plausible. A mechanism very dear to French director Francois Ozon, who Bong Joon-ho seems to be definitely indebted to.\n\nA movie that certainly pleases the crowds with its grotesque and cynical satire and its deliberate use of violence. \nTo quote Calvino:\n\"What many consider to be the vitality of the times - noisy, aggressive, revving and roaring - belongs to the realm of death, like a cemetery for rusty old cars.\"",

In fact, for myself, how I know I really love a movie is when I watch it over and over. It is unlikely I will watch this movie again. The ending was somewhat bewildering, though the message overall appears clear as it relates to pursuing what you think is the good life, only to find that you can easily ruin it. It's also of course a very wrong lesson in using criminal deception to take advantage of innocent people, especially when it leads to murder. Should we really feel sorry for the family that committed all these crimes, or for the innocent family they horribly ruined?",

This is storytelling at its finest, with an engrossing marriage of script, cinematography, acting and detail.\n\nDirector Bong Joon-ho weaves a tale that vacillates between drama and black comedy flawlessly. And just when you get comfortable with this vacillation, he throws in an unexpected twist which brilliantly turns the movie into a suspenseful thriller. As if that weren't captivating enough, the entire film is a satire on societal classes that hammers down hard and heavy.\n\nThere are 10 main characters, and the actors that inhabit them are all impressive. However, I would be remiss not to highlight Kang-ho Song as the patriarch of the Kim family. His ability to convey emotions, and switch between them in seconds, without uttering a word was inspired. He could have you chuckling and then gut wrenched with just the slightest of movement and expression. He was the blue diamond among a cast of rubies and emeralds.\n\nThe story revolves around the Kim family and the Park family. The Kims are a family of little means who are not above con work to obtain an income. The Parks are an affluent family who breeze through the world of social elitism rather obliviously. The Kim family son cons his way into a job tutoring the Park family daughter. Manipulating Mrs. Park, eventually each member of the Kim family ends up working for the Parks, though the Parks are unaware that any of the Kims are actually related. The deception of how each Kim obtains a position in the Park home is outrageously funny. Once they are all employed however, things take a turn in a fantastic \"what the hell?\" moment! To provide more details would be a disservice for anyone who decides to view the film.\n\nIn the end, which family is the parasite remains uncertain. Is it the Kims living off the wealth of the Parks or is it the Parks living off the hard work of the Kims? The movie is quite clear though as it closes on its heartbreaking ending, that the wide gap of wealth disparity is the new norm and the upward mobility of the working class is quite clearly the shadow of a bygone era. No doubt this is one reason the movie resonated so well to audiences worldwide.",

Each character is fleshed out really well and is interesting to watch. The social undertones add an extra layer of depth that makes the film resonate on a deeper level with its viewers. It is well paced and does not waste any time going from point to point. The dialogue is so key in this film and each line seemingly has a deeper meaning or connects to a later plot point. This movie will make you laugh, cry, cringe, and everything in between. This is a film that is enjoyable and can easily be viewed more than once, which it should be viewed more than once. I really cannot find anything to knock on this film. I found it very interesting and entertaining on top of being very well crafted. Overall, I give this movie a 10/10.",

Got it?\" 🍑\n\nStanding head and shoulders above its awards season competition in spite of an obvious language barrier, Gisaengchung is the smartest film about class warfare for some time, and by and large the best of 2019. A brilliantly brutal masterclass in editing, pacing, writing and everything in between, acclaimed director and now household name Bong Joon-ho does for stairs in this \"pitch-black modern fairytale\" what he did for trains in 2013's Snowpiercer, and follows in Hitchcock's footsteps by taking the movie medium to a higher level. Raising his game with riveting and nail-biting sequences that rival, if not eclipse, the best of any English-language picture, Bong transfixes audiences regardless of background, race or social status, for a breath-taking and genre-bending 132 minutes that descends deep into the belly of Seoul's semi-basement dwellings in a metaphori-, no, allegorical movie miracle. Demonstrating commanding craftmanship with his scintillating, near-perfect execution, the South Korean director is not the only talent deserving of 'a glass of soju', as the oustanding ensemble cast shine brightly in this black comedy thriller, spearheaded by Bong's male muse Song Kang-ho, and dynamic camerwork from fellow countryman Hong Kyung-pyo completes the impossibly satisfying package, shooting every frame so visually rich in prescient themes that resonate with today's troubled times flawlessly. As close to cinematic poetry as achieved in the 2010s, this sardonic social satire defies genre, clichés and storytelling conventions for surprising narrative turns, gasp-inducing horror and hilarious chamber piece exchanges, all working in service of a filmgoing experience like no other released in many years. Best watched with no prior knowledge of what to expect, yet still encourages and greatly rewards repeat viewings, show this stunning feature to someone you care about, and prepare to have them left speechless by \"a comedy without clowns, a tragedy without villains\".\n\n9/10 nuclear text messages.",

Not everyone has a creepy married man in their basement, but any viewer can certainly understand the underlying tensions throughout the movie.

            "content": "Parasite is a 2019 South Korean satirical tragedy heist horror thriller dramedy film written and directed by Bong Joon-ho, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Han Jin-won. It stars Song Kang-ho, Lee Sun-kyun, Cho Yeo-jeong, Choi Woo-shik, Park So-dam, Jang Hye-jin, and Lee Jung-eun. The film follows the members of a poor family who scheme to become employed by a wealthy family by infiltrating their household and posing as unrelated, highly qualified individuals.  I'm gonna say the m-word: masterpiece. Say it with me. MASTERPIECE! How does such a prestigious film critic, such as I, convey when a film is unexpected, unpredictable, and above all else, brilliant in ways that feel like I just showed you an episode of Rick & Morty, and therefore your 3rd eye has transcended the laws of basic human anatomy, and opened. Do you think I'm the \"towering-inferno-of-physical-and-mental-perfection\" that cried masterpiece? I'll probably do my best to convince (coerce) you that Parasite truly is a masterpiece. Just trust me on this one, please. Bong has made several films about class, including Snowpiercer and Okja, but Parasite may be his most daring examination of the structural inequity that has come to define our modern-day world. It's a tonal juggling act that first feels like a satirical comedy of manners that showcases a group of lovable con artists off a very wealthy family of awkward eccentrics. But then, Bong takes a hard right turn at exactly the middle of the film that asks us what we're watching and practically warns us that there will be blood. Can the poor really just step into the world of the rich? The second half of the film is one of the most daring things I've seen in years storywise. The film constantly threatens to come apart; to take one convoluted turn too many in ways that sink the project, but Bong holds it all together, and the result is absolutely breathtaking to behold. Kim Ki-woo and his family live on the edge of poverty. They fold pizza boxes for a delivery company to make some quick cash, steal wi-fi from the coffee shop nearby, and leave the windows open when the neighborhood is being fumigated to deal with their own infestation. Kim Ki-woo's life changes when a friend offers to recommend him as an English tutor for a girl he's been working with, as the friend has to go out of the country for a while. The friend is in love with the young girl and doesn't want another tutor to also fall in love with her. Why he trusts Kim Ki-woo is pretty much the only flaw that I can find in the film. Then again I don't have 20/20 vision, so I might need the help of Dora the Explorer. Our hero changes his name to \"Kevin\" and begins tutoring Park Da-hye (Jung Ziso), who immediately falls in love with him, of course. Kevin has a much deeper plan. He's going to get his whole family into this house. He quickly convinces the mother Yeon-kyo, the excellent Jo Yeo-jeong, that the son of the house needs an art tutor, which allows Kevin's sister \"Jessica\" to enter the picture. Before long, mommy and daddy are in the Park house too, and it seems like everything is going perfectly for the Kim family. The Parks seem to be happy too. And then EVERYTHING, and I mean EVERYTHING, changes. The screenplay for the film has rightfully gotten a lot of attention as it's one of those clever twisting and turning tales for which the screenwriter gets the most credit (Bong and Han Jin-won, in this case), but this is very much an exercise in visual storytelling that reaffirms Bong as a master. Working with the incredible cinematographer Kyung-pyo Hong and an A-list design team, Bong's film is captivating with every single composition. The clean, empty spaces of the Park home contrasted against the tight quarters of the Kim home isn't just symbolic, it's visually stimulating without ever calling full attention to itself. And there's a reason the Kim apartment is halfway underground; they're caught between worlds, stuck in the growing chasm between the haves and the have-nots. The film is marvelously entertaining in terms of its story, but there's also so much going on underneath about how the rich use the poor to survive in many ways. Suffice to say, the wealthy in any country survive on the labor of the poor, whether it's the housekeepers, tutors, and drivers they employ, or something much darker. Kim's family will be reminded of that chasm and the cruelty of injustice in ways you couldn't possibly predict. The social commentary of the film inevitably leads to chaos, but it never feels like a teacher teaching you something. It's somehow, and I'm still not even really sure how, both joyful and depressing at the same time. Stick with me here. The film is so perfectly calibrated that there's joy to be had in just experiencing every confident frame of it, but then that's tempered by thinking about what Bong is unpacking here and saying about the society that we live in, especially with the perfect, absolutely haunting final scenes. It's a conversation starter in ways we only get a few times a year, and a further reminder that Bong Joon-Ho is one of the best filmmakers working today. Parasite is a masterpiece. Damnit. I tried to avoid it. This time it's true.",

I don't mean that the film is bad, but I found it extremely overrated.\nThe first part is really fun and does the job of introducing the situation, and making the audience become attached to characters, so it's almost impossible for you to have a favorite character or be \"supporting\" on the one hand. However, this act becomes very slow and long, to the point of getting tiring at some point.\nIn the second act the film gains breath. The plot's various turning points (some surprising, others completely predictable) make the film's rhythm leave the doldrums of the first act for something intense, but without becoming rushed. The big problem here is that the atmosphere of the film is drastically changed, which for the most part is seen as a serious mistake, seems to have gone \"unnoticed\" by most critics. I think it is good that the story takes goes that the audience was not waiting, but the film must be faithful with the tone that he himself established.\nBut nothing is as problematic in this film as its conclusion. Again the film drastically changes its tone (different from the previous two) and moves on to an appalling appeal. By then the film had already had some very questionable script facilitations, but nothing compared to what happens at the end. Many characters take completely unreasonable actions in an attempt to make an impressive and surprising ending. However, what I saw were completely different characters from the ones the film had presented, forcing to try to impress the audience. If you still like any characters at this point, I think you should look for a psychological one.\nParasite tries to be a comedy, a drama and a thriller. Notice that I didn't say a dramatic comedy or a comic thriller. There is no harmony between the different genres, so that one swallows the other as the plot goes on. The result of this is that the film does not work like any of them.",

            "content": "Parasite is a South Korean film by director Bong Joon-ho. Bong says he was inspired to write Parasite back in 2013 when he was challenged to write a play. He used his experience tutoring to a wealthy family back in his 20s. He was also inspired by The housemaid, a story of two French house helpers that murdered their employers. It was the first foreign film to win the best picture at the academy awards.\nJust as the name of the film suggests, parasitism is one of the significant themes featured in the movie. However, the movie doesn't make it clear as to who are the parasites. Society today has made us believe that due to the difference in social classes, it is always the less fortunate in the community that feeds off the wealthy. Based on that, the parasites in this film are Moon-gwang, her husband, and the Kim family. One could also argue that the Parks were the parasites because they couldn't do anything for themselves and were just dependent on the loyalty and skills of their workers. However, the more significant pest seems to be the class inequality where the Kims desire the good life that comes with being productive and the Parks look to get more by always being away on business trips and not doing actual work.\nClass is one of the major themes that are evident throughout the movie, showcasing the enormous gap between the Parks and the Kims. When the film begins, we are introduced to two families who are in totally different social classes. The Kims that reside downtown in a shanty apartment depend on free Wi-Fi to access the internet. The family is displayed to have nothing but themselves. On the other hand, the wealthy Park family appears to have quite a lot of money to spend. They have invested it in employing helpers to assist them in their daily activities like tutoring their children or taking care of their house.\nWhen the Kims secure jobs at the wealthy Park family, they discover just how some people live life luxuriously compared to their lives, so they spend their entire time craving the park's wealth. In the movie, wealth is depicted as something that makes someone brighter and more delightful. However, money is also described as making one lose their sense of accountability and making them lower their guard. This is clear when the Parks don't realize that all their employees are related.\nCapitalism is another theme that was heavily depicted by Bong Joon-ho in this film. The class struggle is embedded in the inequalities built in a capitalistic system. The Kim family doesn't have many opportunities to develop themselves, as shown when the father was unable to secure any form of employment, and the son had been attempting the exams to go to university in vain. However, Mr. Park has been accorded with a lot of opportunities, one being that he already comes from a wealthy family; he is a well educated, successful businessman. This depicts the two families not according to their abilities, but according to where the capitalist economy places them.\nThe film slowly turns away from comedy, and violence begins. Political and psychological violence is depicted when the Parks invite the Kims into their lives but exclude them greatly in ways that highlight the existing disparities. Perverse violence occurred when the Kim's were occupying the Parks' house when they were away for camping. The Kim family started fighting moon-gwang and her husband, with both parties wanting to be the beneficiaries of the relationship with the Parks, which they believe will save them from hardships in life.\nThe final scene depicts the gruesome violence in the whole film. Moon-gwang is pushed down the stairs by Chung-sook. Ki-woo is hit with a rock by Geun-sae till he loses consciousness. This early violence showcases how the lower classes always turn on each other. Mr Park acted disgusted to the smell of Geun-sae, which sparked rage in Ki-taek who stabbed him. The bloodbath that ended the film was seen when implicit violence of the characters for the political and structural positions came out.\nInfrastructural and environmental collapse is depicted where the entire existence of the poor was based on perils for instance, at the beginning of the film where we are shown the Kims family lives in the dark basement, which was infested with insects. They would keep the window open so they could benefit from the fumigation that was being done in the streets. Another example of their perils was the night there was a rainstorm, and the Parks were forced to come back from their camping trip. Da-song decides to spend a night out in his waterproof tent in their backyard. In contrast, the Kims rush home amidst the heavy rain and find that their street was flooded, and rainwater had mixed up with sewage. Their home is wholly ruined and unlivable, with most of their belongings floating on the water. Here Bong Joon-ho shows that being of a low class isn't about lacking luxuries enjoyed by the rich but a matter of significant vulnerability to diseases, infrastructural and environmental collapse.\nThe whole film is centered around deception, and it is thrilling to see the whole of Kim's family deceiving the parks and getting away with it. They let the Parks think that they were in control, yet they had created a great plan of deceit complete with fake qualifications. It raises the question if people in the lower class have to deceive their way to the top to climb the ladder of societal class.\nIn conclusion, Bong Joon-ho's movie Parasite is a phenomenal movie that speaks of the various things relatable to society today. From a philosophical aspect, it was a great mirror of society and showcased themes that are depicted today.",

            "content": "The movie Parasite is a brilliantly shot film that displays the relationship between the working class families and the upper class families in the modern capitalist society. In the plot, the Park family hires lower class workers for jobs like housekeeping, tutoring, and chauffeuring. The Kims family, eager to raise themselves above the level of despairing poverty, find their way into the Parks house by replacing old staff and getting employed. Unbeknown to both the Park and Kim family, the old housekeeper's family, her husband Kun-Sae, actually lived in the basement of the Parks house and survived off of whatever scraps of food and leftovers he could get.\n       There is so much meaning to be unpacked in this film, and we could start with the architecture. The very fact that the previous help had resided in the basement of the house's actual basement shows how these working class families are physically lower than the upper class, as they reside in the dark cemented basement like \"cockroaches\" and rats in sewers. Actually, the way Kun-Sae crawls around and devours his food is similar to that of an animal, as he seems to have forgotten how to function normally. The only way to reach this basement is through a long flight of stairs leading down. Stairs seem to be a significant symbol throughout the film, as the Kim family has to take many long flights of stairs in the city to reach their house, which is also a semi-basement. This visual representation of climbing stairs represents the long journey working class families need to take to reach the upper class or improve their lives. Towards the end of the film, when the father Ki-Tek ends up replacing the old man and living in the house's basement to avoid punishment for murder, and he says \"Each time, I go upstairs [to scavenge for food] I take my life in my hands.\" And this is representative of the struggle working-class families face when they are just trying to survive. \n       There is also a very interesting representation of the upper class as almost Godly. In a scene, Kun-Sae in the basement looks at pictures of Mr. Park hanging all over the wall, and shouts \"Respect! You [Mr. Park] feed me and house me.\" He then explains that he sends him whole sentences in Morse code through the light bulbs to thank him. This is almost parallel to the relationship between man and God, as prayers of thanks are made through specific methods (like codes) for the blessings of life. This presentation seems to be highlighting the extent of class difference between these two types of people, almost saying that it elevates the status of the rich Mr. Park to God and that of the poor and needy Kun-Sae to his servant. In another display to highlight the relationship between the working and upper class, it becomes clear that the \"automatic light bulbs\" that go on when someone walks up the entrance stairs is actually Kun-Sae pressing the buttons for those lights, signifying how man's efforts below generates man's luxury above.\n\tFinally, in reference to the name Parasite, depending on one's analysis both working and rich families can be depicted as parasites, as they both seek to benefit from the other. While the rich want to benefit from the need of the poor for labor and money to favor their lives (quite literally in the end when Mr. Park asked Mr. Kim to fetch the car for his son instead of saving his own daughter's life), the poor want to benefit from the gullibility and wealth of the rich to make money and have better lives. Overall, the film was thrilling to watch as it kept you wondering what would happen next and what the symbols represent.",

            "content": "Writer/director Bong Joon Ho (\"The Host\" \"Snowpiercer\" \"Okja\") has been on a roll of late with thought provoking genre films with underlying social commentary. From river monsters, to end-of-the-world tales, to a pig-like Totoro, Bong is not afraid to take seemingly popcorn concepts and work them into a smart film that has arthouse and movieplex crossover appeal. With \"Parasite\" he takes a more subtle route and tells the story of a struggling family living in a tiny basement hovel in South Korea where they have to leech off neighbors unprotected wifi and deal with nightly public urination outside their alley-side windows. When the son lands a job as a tutor for the daughter of a rich family by pretending to be a college student and lying about his resume, he spots an opportunity to recommend his sister as an art teacher for the younger brother, hiding that she's his sister and lying about her credentials as well. Next the brother and sister scheme to get the chauffeur fired so their dad can land the job and then how to fire the longtime housekeeper so their mom can snatch that opening. To tell more would spoil the fun, but I will say the film takes an unexpected turn and dramatic shift in tone. I had no idea where the film was going or how it was going to end and the ultimate ending is quite a shocker. What's most interesting about the film is asking the question, who really is the parasite? Is it the lower class family living off the rich family host or is it this privileged rich family living off the backs of their working class servants? The answer is that it could be either or most likely both. Bong's thesis appears to be that this situation of haves and have-nots coexisting is untenable and will lead to an inevitable collision course, much as it happened in his prior film \"Snowpiercer.\"  Bong sums it up best himself when he was described \"Parasite\" as \"a comedy without clowns, a tragedy without villains.\" If I had a complaint about the film it's that the shift from humorous satire to something darker felt a bit incongruous, but Bong likely did this intentionally to bolster the film's message around the inevitable conclusion of a world of stark haves and have-nots. \"Parasite\" is a compelling film that delivers a pure cinematic experience, meaning that it's a story that could not have been told in any other medium, and is an absolute treat for cinema lovers.",

            "content": "I've seen over 700 movies and this is my first foreign language film review. This is also the first film I've seen directed by Bong Joon-Ho. Immediately, viewers witness the gritty detail of Korean slums as a family of 4 searches every crevice of their house for wifi. They fold pizza boxes for money and leave the windows open to let the street exterminator's fog kill the cockroaches in their house. The parents have tried to get jobs and have not been hired. Their children have unique skills but have been rejected by the system. This is not an anomaly in our lives, regardless of where we are from. Kevin's (Choi Woo-shik) friend gives the family a scholar's rock, said to bring the family material wealth. It does. There is a stellar scene with them sitting at the table before they all get jobs. They get jobs because they lie about their class. Joon-Ho's argument is that lower class people are just as skilled as upper-class people, if not more, but they are rejected because they do not \"know the right people\". This is a phrase we often hear, especially in business. Good connections go a long way. How are these connections reached? The ending scene, like all lasting art metaphors, must be inferenced. It is a realization of Kevin's that he will never accumulate enough money to save his dad. Joon-Ho is saying that as the rich get richer, a gap widens between them and the poor. My favorite scene is Kevin and his dad laying on mattresses in a gym after their apartment flooded out. They discuss life and how the lack of a plan in life will leave a person's emotions unchanged. If they had a plan and it didn't happen, they would be angry. With no plan, they continue to live unaffected. I believe Joon-Ho is saying that it is hard for the poor to have dreams, because these dreams can be easily dashed. In contrast, the life of an upperclassman is mapped out. Early schooling, college, a career, retirement and death. Funny how both complain about their current cirucumstances.",

This is a deliciously well-crafted and strongly scripted blend of multiple genres that come together cohesively thanks to a director at the peak of his craft.  \n\nParasite, in my eyes, is a comedy, suspense, and drama.  The way it's shot, paced, written, acted, and overall executed, is done with sharp precision so that not a single moment feels wasted or pointless.  An overarching theme I noticed throughout the film, which may be entirely subjective, is that being wealthy doesn't denote being smart, and being poor doesn't denote being stupid.  An impoverished family slyly infiltrated a richer one, right under their noses.  \n\nAt first I felt pity for the poor family's life predicament; living in a basement where you constantly see tramps urinating on your property sounds like a life nobody wants.  Yet, as the movie progressed, I began feeling less sympathetic towards them as their plot to infiltrate the family as a means to their own monetary gain was unraveling.  I'll admit, it was clever how they would get one person fired, then recommend one of their family members to replace them, without ever mentioning their relationship to avoid getting caught.  But, essentially, they became criminals.  However, you can see why they'd resort to that.  Desperate times call for desperate measures.\n\nGreed, the desire for materialistic gain, and the hunger to move up socially, can spiral out of control and backfire.  That's what happens to this impoverished family.  Funny enough, by the end of the movie, I'm back on their side sympathizing with them again.  The bloody final act was a logical culmination of everything leading up to it; I love when a movie slowly boils hotter and hotter into an explosive finale.  Taxi Driver did it, and so does Parasite.  I was lingering between giving this a strong 4.5 with the intention to rewatch it and give it a 5 if it holds up, but screw it.  It's a 5, and I'm still going to rewatch it later down the road.",

A small Korean film that's taken over the western world.\nParasite is a thought provoking film that's best watched knowing nothing about it. Having walked into this film only watching the trailer once I didn't know what to expect, therefore I was pleasantly surprised by the last 40 minutes, the twists and turns as well as the acting and social commentary, gives Parasite an edge that makes it stand out above other 2019 films. \nThis movie will surely become a classic in the near future and well deserved it will be.",

Pretty much everyone in the movie is a \"parasite\" (though I don't recall what the chauffeur's sin was - maybe he's the only decent guy). \n\nThe first half of the movie plays plausibly as a set up for some weird plot about a poor family supplanting a rich one. But then the plot goes in a really strange direction. The plausibility plummets and strangeness ensues. Seemingly, all this poor family's efforts to be employed by the rich hasn't substantially improved their lives.\n\nThe ending is also bizarre. The parasite in residence goes on a rampage. A bunch of people are stabbed, and it's unclear to me who lived and who died. It's also unclear to me why the father got involved. That insanity didn't seem to advance his interests any; in fact, it's somewhat unclear how their scheme would have been uncovered even if the basement were revealed. But no, the father got involved, seemingly unable to contain his contempt and taking advantage of everyone else being skewered at the time.\n\nThe \"epilogue\" doesn't help much. It shows that the family remain in their same situation, maybe worse. The father is now the great parasite. The son fantisizes (or whatever, unclear how this message is reaching the father) that he'll be rich one day and rescue the father.\n\nThe movie overall isn't fun. It's interesting, perhaps enjoyable, but unpleasant. The plot operates at the limits of credulity and the characters generally make you want to see them get stabbed. Does the movie have a message? Yeah. There are social classes. That's pretty much it.",

And being poor doesn't give you license to kill someone who says you smell bad. Calling this film and expose on social justice is an insult to films that effectively examine social class and its impact on lives. I could not relate to nor empathize with even one character in the film. They were hollow. The film carried no true emotional depth. And if it was meant to be a comedic effort, I think I laughed twice, at most. It wasn't funny, it's wasn't thrilling, it wasn't dramatic, it was... dumb? And, as mentioned, violent. The storyline, itself, had potential. It could have gone really interesting places. It did not. And the ending? The kid is going to somehow become rich and buy probably the most expensive home in South Korea to free his father from the basement of the house. Sure.

II had to watch this film with subtitles as I do not speak a word other than English, and boy do I wish I did just so I could understand this film in all its glory. One thing to note (that did not impact my rating at all) is that it is long film and reading subtitles for that long can, for me at least, get tiring. Just go into it with the mindset of being ready to really, really focus on the film and I think anyone would enjoy it.",

Because this movie has subtitles and was praised to be so great, I decided it needed my undivided attention and I succeeded in doing so. Sitting at 2 hours and 12 minutes I was completely sucked in. You could say this movie is a comedy that turns dark that is filled with laughs, thrills, and suspense while delivering a message about class discrimination. Many great movies can also be predictable but I found myself on a roller coaster ride full of twists and turns, and plenty of uncertainty. With great acting all around and amazing cinematography, you are in for a film-going experience.\n\nI give Parasite a 9.5/10 and recommend you give it a watch on digital during our time of social distancing.",

I actually checked my phone while my wife was considering to leave. Then the shock/surprise in the basement. Really? We thought, okay this is it, oscar material coming up....\nBut the enthusiasm lasted for 32 seconds.\nThe old maid surely would be able to get in at midnight and get her husband out but she went through the front door expecting not to be caught by the new maid? Seriously????? Come'on!  \nThen the whole social class bullshit. Really? This was a have vs have-nots? The scammers are incredibly well skilled, whether cooking or driving or arts class.\n. \nThen the lose ends; the CCTV camera was pointed at the garage so Mr Kim the driver returning into the house after the killing should have been caught. Why was this ignored? Gonna get a sequel? \nSecond lose end; how was the old maid killed? Kind of a big deal. Yep she fell on her head and then rambled on, but died? \nThird lose end; kid while camping sees the blinking light and deciphers the morse-code message. But nothing is done with it.\nAnd then the biggest let-down. The underdog, the victim of social injustice, Mr Kim the driver, kills the loving father out of rage because he is told he smells badly? Looked down upon? Made fun of? Come'on. \nHow are we, the public, supposed to buy that.\nAs to the final part of the movie. What a crap. Go in hiding for months (maybe even years is suggested)? No building plans of the cellar while the house is sold to ignorant Germans? Using a light Morse code to reach his son after months/years instead of going out at night while raiding the fridge getting the news out? \n.\nI speculate the 90% score public approval score is related to the kind of viewers (most people won't go see, pay for, this kind of movie). \nIf one would show this to a random batch of 100 people approval would be below 15% sure. \nBTW the wife is hot... wow!",

If you miss a scene, then you can't follow up what comes next. This goes really in depth with the characters and what the Korean family is trying to do. Later on, it becomes suspenseful as the families encounter more trouble within the mansion. It was really well done and a pretty good drama. I still don't really get why some parts happen, I probably need to watch it again. I still think there should be an English Dub for this. Once they do that, I'll see it again.

Given my 50/50 chance to fall asleep during a movie, I didn't even blink as I was so immersed in the story and was anxious to see how things develop.\nEveryone should watch this movie, at least once; I am planning to watch it the second time.\n \nFirst of all, I love socioeconomic contrasting between the extremely rich and the extremely poor, every step of the way - their beliefs, day-to-day life, living environment, outfit, and how they treat others. For this low-income family, they even have to go to this very spot in their tiny restroom to get the free Wifi from an unknown neighbor, but they can be so happy for fighting this kind of thing. However, this wealthy family has so much that they even need a basement to store all of their kimchi. As a person who has lived in both Taiwan and the U.S., I feel like this dynamic is universal, not just applicable not just to South Korea. Given the worsening wealth gaps growing across the globe, the movie portraits something so real that it didn't feel like a comedy.\n \nThe acting is brilliant. All the actors are well-rounded, with great character developments progress as the story evolves. Especially for the son, his evolution was fascinating, from an insecure left-behind young man to feeling getting to something, then felt responsible for killing the maid for his family, even though that was against his will. The dad was incredible. He was willing to do anything for his family, even was humiliated by the boss and boss wife. Deep inside, his self-esteem was his last front-tier, and he couldn't stand people judging his \"lower-class\" smell.\nIt triggered all of his insecurities, and eventually, he killed the boss.\n \nThe scenery was magnificent. There is a contrast between their houses. This elevated mansion, extremely spacious space that everyone has its own space, neat and clean with elegant design. In the meantime, a tiny place next to sewage, with drunk people passing by and pissing all the time. When the water came, it almost feel like their meager existence was ever so fragile, and it is one flood away from being wiped out\n \nThe ending was great, though I felt that is somehow predictable. But I like how it was weaving the son's fantasy and reality. The metaphor appeared that the poor people couldn't have most of the things, but they can always dream of buying that huge mansion one day, and all of their problems are solved.\n \nI highly recommend this movie, and I have no intelligent arguments to counter the hypes. For this movie, I am willing to succumb to the hype and being label as a bandwagoner. Yes, I watched this movie after they received the awards. But, I think this movie is well-deserved for its best picture, given its uniqueness, well-versed storytelling, fantastic acting, and directing. So don't wait, watch it, and let me know what you think!",

Yet the obvious resemblance between the parents and the kids couldn't be noticed, at all??? Or at least an acknowledgement of that somewhere in the movie? The 'strange-smell' was mentioned by Mr park, but then it was attributed to a certain class of people, and people who stay close to a particular bridge.\n-- No cameras inside such a posh residence. That was convenient coz that would have ruled out the daughter eavesdropping on the conversations, and the powdery peach allergen being used against the old housekeeper.\n-- The old housekeeper makes an escape from the basement, with her hands still tied behind, and screaming \"Mrs Park\" at the top of her lungs, coming up the stairs. All this happens while Mrs park is talking to the new housekeeper in the kitchen/near the kitchen, which is just where the opening of the stairs is. Why would her screams not be heard?\nI think if they had addressed these issues as well, the movie would have been even better!!",

            "content": "In this dark comedy thriller, the Kims, a resourceful lower-class family swindle their way into employment within the home of the wealthy Park family. Rich with style and social commentary ‘Parasite' presents director Bong Joon-ho in complete control of his craft. \n\nThe cinematography works subtly to convey the rising tension of the film with purposeful slow push-ins on the characters. Even if the audience doesn't at first notice this subtle movement, we subconsciously feel the pressure closing in on the Kim family and a sense of foreboding disaster as their con is at risk of collapse. The film is filled with deliberate long takes, the smooth camera movement shifts the shots creating new compositions and keeps the frame visually interesting without the need to cut. This helps to give more opportunity for characters to share the screen building on the visual representation of their relationships. These long moving shots also function as a method of emphasising the scale of the Parks' house and give the audience the chance to gain a well-constructed sense of the space which is symbolic of the Parks' vast wealth. \n\nThe production design is immaculate and demonstrates a careful attention to detail, both the Park and Kim houses were sets constructed for the film and while they could not be more aesthetically dissimilar, they both feel equally believable. The locations of these two houses are also important, with a not so subtle metaphor the Kim family live down a street in a semi-basement dwelling while the Park house sits atop a hill. This vertical distancing represents both the separation of the families and their respective classes. Through this visualisation we understand that there are physical structures in place enforcing the separation of the classes, while the rich keep moving up, for the poor the uphill battle only gets harder. This idea translates in the story as setbacks for the Kim family negatively compound, forcing them into a downward spiral while the Parks' with their established forward momentum easily transform obstacles into positive opportunity. \n\nBut the movie is more complex than ‘poor people good, rich people bad' each family possesses both good and bad traits showing a common humanity, aiming the critique towards the system rather than the people within it. The lower class can be viewed as infantilized by their idolisation of the rich, while the upper class may be considered child-like in their naivety towards the struggle of the less fortunate. The two sides of society romanticise aspects of the other, what then separates them is the ease with which the wealthy Park family can dip into that fantasy and return to their privilege while the Kim family are punished for their aspirations and attempt to embrace a more lavish lifestyle outside of their designated class. \n\nIn ‘Parasite' Bong Joon-ho has carefully crafted a slick and evocative film that through excellent film technique conveys important social themes of the segregation of classes through the systematic structures of society. The film Resonated with audiences all while being insanely entertaining leading to a much-deserved Best Picture win.",

In terms of intrigue, I think it got the job done well and quite honestly, very funny at times, then disturbing at times ... as I said, unpredictable, which I like. However, I don't think this was a 4 star or a 5-star film. With ongoing stigmatization and stereotypes of the lower class and the poor, I did not appreciate the way the poor were portrayed in this film; liars, cheaters, dishonest individuals who cannot make an honest living, who are incapable of challenging upper class intellectually and competing and even exceeding those standards. At first, when he started tutoring, I thought \"wow, he's a got a chance to prove that he's even better than the wealthy kid\" ... but no. It turns into deceitful games, plotting, lying, jeopardizing ... in short, really reaffirms the unfortunate stereotypes of the lower class or the poor, especially those who are the housekeepers full time. If anything, this film probably exacerbated the paranoia of the upper class to be on edge when it comes to hiring people or their current staff. Really distasteful. As someone who rose from the lower class through extreme work ethic, I can tell you, I don't appreciate these types of films one bit. The message of this film was beyond disturbing and tone-deaf; essentially sending a message that there is no hope for you, so the father makes matters worse by committing murder which then reaffirms the stereotype of the poor being dangerous and murderous. This film was all sorts of tone-deaf culturally. I feel that those who come from comfortable lives saw this film as some novel plot, maybe even think they were empathizing with the struggles of the poor by liking this film ... but as I mentioned, personally coming from poverty, the message and stereotyping were beyond f***ed up. If you didn't feel it, then you don't know what it's like to work your a** off to rise up and have to deal with BS stereotypes like in this film.",

            "content": "It seems that in the United States of America, nothing is original anymore. At least, that is what the assumption is. But, if one were to look outside the country, there exists a whole slew of original material just waiting to be watched. And look no further than the country of South Korea. That is where today's film \"Parasite\" is the definition of originality. Directed by Bong Joon-ho and co-Written by him, the movie is a cautionary modern allegory of the poor taking on the rich. But what makes \"Parasite\" truly stand out is that the movie is something us Americans need more than ever. It's all thanks to one little country all the way across the Pacific. From it's acting, direction, set and production design, to even the little details that require multiple viewings to get an accurate detail of what is going on. \"Parasite\" is one of those films that thrives on originality, and make the use of its country to a great maximum.\n\nThe story is a little complicated to explain; just keep in mind, that you have to experience the movie for yourself in order to understand it. But I'll try my best not to spoil the movie. The plot of the film involves a poor family living in South Korea trying to make ends meet. A friend of the son comes by and tells him that he works for a very rich family, and that he is going abroad. He asks the son to take over his job, to which the son accepts gratefully. Soon, the son gets his family into working for the rich people. But as this family learns, everything comes with a price...\n\n\"Parasite\", like I said. Is one of those films that you just have to see for yourself in order to fully understand, but here's what I mean when you need to see this movie.\n\nThe setting is perfect for this film; it couldn't happen here in the United States, as it would impose as a difficulty within the context of the story. That and the cinematography are absolutely stunning. From the shifting weather of sunny to rain, the movie really looks good, and it is required to have it played out on the big screen, if possible.\n\nOn a technical level, \"Parasite\" excels in everything. From the lighting to the sound, everything is mixed and edited extremely well, as it is handled in a direction that fits the nature of the film itself. Top that with a minimalist orchestrated score, and you got yourself one amazing film to view.\n\nHowever, there are two things that work in a grandiose manner for \"Parasite\".\n\nFirst, the direction from Bong Joon-ho is absolutely stunning. From the blocking of actors, to the when the intense moments occur, including two very important scenes with the poor family trying to escape the rich family's house, and an intense thunderstorm, his direction is everywhere. It is simply the best. Bong Joon-ho is clearly starting to become one of the best directors of modern cinema, and \"Parasite\" clearly shows that this man has potential.\n\nThe most important aspect for this movie is the story. Cultures clashing, the importance of family, it's all here, and handled extremely well. Contrasting a run time of a little over two hours, the story grips the viewers attention on the edge of their seats, with jaws dropping and eyes wide open, the story is full of twists and turns that you will not see coming.\n\nHowever, while the story is really good, and providing some inciting social commentary, there are some problems with it. For one thing, there are some plot holes and situations that don't make a whole lot of sense, and it seems like the poor family planned this in advance. But other than that, the movie itself is a damn solid piece of entertainment.\n\nOverall, \"Parasite\" is a magnificent film that truly proves there is potential for originality to shine through. We just got to look for it.",

Bong once again masterfully crafts a metaphor for his progressive views.  Keeps you guessing and pays it off in the end.  However, the twist in it is... not only unexpected, but almost ridiculously impossible, and it immediately turned a very intelligent, psychological thriller into something akin to allegory.  Furthermore, the extreme violence in the end, while common on Bong's movies, is out of touch with the rest of the movie.  Ultimately, its creative choices confused me.  Excellent movie I'd recommend, but some deep flaws.",

Parasite doesn't sacrifice an ounce of its wildly entertaining story or compelling characters for its in depth analysis of class struggles in our modern capitalist society. I've never seen a film that blends genres so perfectly. One minute you're in tears of laughter, the next your weeping out of fear and anxiety as to what horrific twist the film will take next. A perfect blend of subtly and obviousness allows the films hefty amount of symbolism to serve both the nail biting plot and the more than relevant point the filmmaker aims to make on class struggle and wealth. Bong Joon Ho has proved he is one of greatest filmmakers in the world with plenty of offer in upcoming years. There's no doubt that given the perfection we have seen in his latest, Best Picture Winning film, the world will be watching and anxiously waiting for what he creates next. What's more, the attention this Oscar winner has gardened will mean the west will be looking into the hidden gems of cinema we've missed in Korea and beyond.",

Some might be bothered also by the moral murkiness this demonstrates(particularly toward the end)but that's it's genius: there really ARE no clear answers to instances of human frailty.

WOW what a movie, one of the best films and some of the best directing I have ever seen, so many good things to talk about here so let's get started here.\n\nFirst of all, the performances and the Kim family were very interesting. Everyone's performances here was fantastic and I am surprised the actors are not getting more recognition here. Everyone did a very nuanced and excellent job at showing the cleverness of the characters and how far the characters will go not to get found out. I also found the Kim family very interesting. I loved how they were slowly one by one making their way into the house, and the whole family had completely different personalities which I also appreciated.\n\nNext the film-built tension really well and used gore effectively. This film balanced so many tones well, but I think it balanced the tenseness very well. Due to being confined to the house for a large majority it was very claustrophobic for the characters. And some of the camerawork when the family was hiding was truly fantastic and made you feel tense in general but also for the characters involved. They also used gore very effectively as well. It wasn't overused but it didn't need to be, but it was used enough to leave an impact in the perfect way. They happened more out of nowhere which was excellently executed and very startling.\n\nNext the films cinematography and set pieces were fantastic. Wow this film was an absolute feast for the eyes, whether it was the attention to detail through the camerawork or using normal props like peaches or tents in a completely different way this film was just so detailed and masterfully filmed it was insane to watch. The set pieces were also fantastic, I loved the deliberate sharp contrast between the rich and the poor house and both were explored very well, the poor house of the Kim's was extremely cramped and they gave you a good visual representation of what living in the slums would be like, but the contrast of the rich families house was fantastic, it had so many different components to it and each part of the house was explored well it was a great playground for some fantastic and cleverly put together scenes.\n\nMy next two positives would be the humour and the fantastic final act. Parasite had a fantastic comedic undertone to it that worked really well the dynamic between the Kim family really worked and they had some great comedic moments together that reminded me of my own family in places, similar to the gore it wasn't overused and I am glad it wasn't as otherwise the film wouldn't of worked as well but it was used enough to get a few good laughs out of me. I also have to commend Bong Jun Ho for a truly fantastic final act that was completely unexpected. I didn't know what was going to happen which was fantastic and left me wanting to know what happens next, and where they ended up going with the film took me by complete surprise but in the best way possible, huge respect for Bong for his masterful directing here.\n\nMy final two positives that really made the movie phenomenal was its exceptional script and deep and truthful themes about the class divide in today's society. Wow I think this film had the best script I have ever had the pleasure of hearing. The amount of amazing comments on society and clever ways to develop the characters I was in awe of the films cleverness. The films messages about the class conflict in today's society were so insightful it really made me stop and think which is what a good movie shall do. How the film portrayed the naivety of the upper class and how unaware they are of the struggles of the poor was excellent.  The ending was also showed the harsh brutality of where the poor is places in society and that is sadly underneath the rich which was really impactful for me I gave this film 99 only because it took me a fair amount of time to realise the true message of the film instead of straight away. But there was just so many little messages that were conveyed so well it really made you think.\n\nOverall parasite is one of the best films I have ever seen, with masterful directing, cinematography, screenwriting and performances which leads to an exciting rollercoaster of a film that will leave you shocked and make you think more deeply about the state of the world class system.",

            "content": "Parasite is a social realistic film that is multifaceted and ranges in use of heavy tone shifts and perfectly composed visual imagery, while simultaneously composed of heavy commentary on class division. Bong has the ability to fluidly create transformations within the characters themselves and their environments, having the calm housekeeper become a madwoman and a happy backyard celebration become a bloodbath.  Countering the opinions made by Rick Kisonak from the Vermont newspaper Seven Days, in which he claims that the movie makes no significant statements, I believe that the insight that this film offers does measure up to the grandeur it is receiving. Some in accordance with Kisonak may argue that referencing a social ill isn't the same as saying something insightful about it. However, I believe that the conversations that are being generated in response to the film surrounding social realism and its role in modern-day society are insightful in themselves. Kisonak is quick to assume that the Bong wants us to side with the poor, and as a result, believes that the commentary of the movie is condescending. Though there is ambiguity created from the fact that both families are set up so that you are not rooting for one over I find it extremely tasteful and it further enforces his theme that there are no bad guys here. It leaves room for the audience to ponder on who the real parasites are. Is it the poor who attach themselves to the rich in efforts to leech off their wealth? Is it the rich thrive who off the backs of the poor, and are unable to complete basic tasks without enlisting working-class servants to refine their lives? Or rather is it the system itself, the same system that thrives off the turbulence created by class division?",

            "content": "Bong Joon-ho delivers a unique, theme-ridden story rich with thought inspiring symbolism. Parasite is at its core, a comedic heist movie that evolves into a tragedy; a brilliant piece of satire that gives an insightful look into class struggle. The film delves deep into the modern human hunger for wealth, the relentless search for it, and how tunnel vision can bring out the worst in even the sanest of humans. What begins as the impoverished Kim family's light-hearted and comical attempt at inserting themselves into the wealthy Park family by providing various \"high-end\" services, upon revealing to the audience a dark secret unbeknownst to the Parks, then spirals into sadistic cataclysm unraveling the basest of human intents leading to a gory, terrifying conclusion. A stellar cast does a brilliant job of portraying the various personalities of both families, making the characters feel all the more believable. The core message Parasite conveys is obvious, as it is stated by one of the main characters. However, it is what lies beneath that message that Bong Joon-ho wants the audience to decipher, and this is done remarkably through the themes and symbolism alluding to those answers. Parasite is perhaps arguably one of the most important cinematic works of the decade, shedding light on countless societal issues that plague our time. It forces viewers to see class divide through the eyes of the Kim family in their pursuit of wealth and complete disregard for others, leaving a trail of despair that comes back to haunt them. Viewers should expect to walk away from the theatre with philosophical and psychological questions with difficult answers, and should inspire discussions about the human psyche. Expect Parasite to age very well, as it will serve future audiences by conveying relatable subject matter for many years to come, divulging to the viewer that to expect the unexpected is an absolute necessity if one is to survive.",

I didn't even want to see the movie; my girlfriend made us go. Every character does not need 20-30mins of getting them into the rich family. It wasn't even interesting how they were doing it. All they did for each character when it comes down to it, was to trick the rich mom by simply telling her too. The dumbest part of the movie is how the poor dad killed the rich dad. You could had taken your daughter to the hospital, saved your wife, killed the killer, or go to your son. But, you chose to kill the one man or has treated you well and was just trying to take his son to the hospital? Why, do you have such a thing against people thinking you smell bad/poor? The movie never explains or shows anything? All of a sudden that's your killing motivation? So, stupid. I get it, he wasn't all emotional there, because he just saw his son lifeless body being carried and daughter stabbed. Also, some stuff with social status, but who cause. They don't show/explains anything and it's all left for your own interpretation. My interpretation is wtf? There still so much things I want to say like how the bad the movie's theme went from and a scheming to suspends to a slasher film in like 0 to 100, how unrealistically the family member got into the rich family, how the father is a millionaire or something, but doesn't have security and so on. Seriously, felt like I was sitting in the theater for 4hrs. Anyways, such a boring boring movie.",

With a sequence that resembles the beginning of Scola's Ugly, Dirty and Bad (Brutti, sporchi e cattivi, 1976), Bong Joon Ho transport us into a world that unfolds the social tensions between the poor and the wealthy.  A black comedy takes place, touching the viewer's most secret fears about globalization: the upheaval of the poorest, yet capable immigrants, against their privileged, yet overconfident, masters. As in Kafka's novels, the hyperreality of the fable supersedes the metaphor in order to create its own universe.  The absurdity of the plot is compensated with our will to believe on it.  A father, a mother and their children–son and daughter, stage a series of scams in order to become servants of a wealthy family.  Their reward is awkwardly naïve: the possibility of becoming masters of the house when their masters are not at home.\n\ncXoFTolA\n\nParasite starts in a basement, a clear allusion to Almodóvar's High Heels (Tacones Lejanos, 1991). All the members of the family are unemployed. They appeared to be crooked, but their crookedness doesn't go beyond stealing their neighbor's WIFI signal. All the conventions of reality are broken and we are introduced into a metaphorical universe. The basement is part of a building in no-one's land, or in the poorest slums of most third-world countries, from Haiti to Bangladesh, from Sudan to Vietnam. A family of capable, and yet frustrated professionals, are obliged to accept the first opportunity to \"travel\" to another community thanks to an unexpected recommendation. Their social status becomes a real problem. After all, they are the outcasts of the earth; so, they are obliged to falsify their son's documents. The social status of a professional without a degree is, indeed, not very different from that of an immigrant without a working visa. But before getting his coveted job, the son should present his documentation to customs. The appointment of Sun-Kyun Lee with Yeo-jeong Jo could have taken place in any customs office of the world. Yeo-jeong dismisses the documents as unimportant, for they appear to be authentic. To insist on the protocols of a world divided by stamps may seem rude for such an aristocratic lady. Woo-sik gets his job and, by pushing one of the most sensitive topics of immigration, tries to seduce the youngest girl of the family.\n\nStill, not happy with the benefits of his new job, Woo-sik conspires to move all the members of his family into his new adoptive home. His sister gets soon a vacant job as a tutor. But they also want to bring their parents, so they plot against the chauffeur and the maiden of the house. They both get fired. Almost immediately the unfortunate locals are replaced by Mr. and Ms. Kim. The story appears to end there. How brief happy endings are. We are fate to witness the furious reaction of the locals.\n\nFrom immemorial times, natives have resented the presence of immigrants in their communities. It's believed that they rob their jobs and that they seduce their women. Quite often, enraged and, needless to write, intolerant mobs, decide to correct such \"abuses\", so they attack and kill innocent men, women and children. In Joon-ho's celebrated film all this happens. The second part of the film is a battle between the immigrants and the locals for the privileged of serving the wealthy. But the wealthy are not exempt of guilt.  After all, they have created the social conditions for a struggle that conveys a scant reward. In the final scenes of the film, the revolt of the servants becomes a revolution. A Native-American tent is set up in a children's party as a sinister reminder of the triumph of a group of immigrants over the locals. In Parasite, it's a failed revolution. After all, revolutions today are only allowed in third-world countries. At the end, all immigrants pay for their crimes. They learnt the hard way. They are obliged to accept that ceaseless work and study are the only possible ways to success.\n\nA parable on Immigration, but also a warning on the social conditions of globalization, where a global revolt appears to be just around the corner.\n\nBucaramanga, September 16, 2019",

            "content": "For a movie to be hyped to death and then still meet expectations is impressive. And yet, Parasite didn't just meet my expectations, it surpassed them. \n\nAnyone who knows me will tell you that I never read reviews before watching a movie; I'll only read them after. I always preach about the benefits of knowing little about a movie before seeing it. I think Parasite is a case in point: a movie enjoyed most thoroughly when the viewer has little pre-existing knowledge about it. \n\nWhat makes Bong Joon-ho's latest feature so exciting is its unpredictability. It has a surprising narrative structure. Think of Parasite, if you will, as a train journey, with Bong the chief architect and the driver. The train doesn't arrive at the expected end destination, and the journey to the final stop is wildly unpredictable. The tonal landscape of the movie shifts as Parasite moves throughout its course. Social realism gives way to surreal horror, by way of jet-black humour and sometimes farce. For our train journey metaphor, think of these tonal changes as the volatile weather outside the window. And despite the unpredictable nature of the journey, the driver always maintains complete control of all. \n\nOkay, excuse the rough metaphor, but it seems apposite to include one in a review of a film whose director's metier is metaphors. In fact, in what seems like a self-mocking act from Bong, characters in the film often comment several times on how metaphorical things are. The movie is, too, full of symbolism: the rain and different levels being two noteworthy ones. The film is so packed with symbols and metaphors, it makes watching it so fascinating. \n\nThe sociopolitical import of Parasite is clear, highlighting the disparity between South Korea's classes, and taking aim at late capitalism. The politics works because its central message is delivered through humour and horror (in equal measure), instead of prosaically, as with many other films. Metaphors are the tool Bong uses oftentimes to highlight the differential lives of the rich and the poor families. For instance, the rain that comes down towards the end of the movie flooding the entire house of the Kim family fails to penetrate the Park child's tent. At times in the latter half of the movie, Bong perhaps suffers from a lack of subtlety, laying the message on too thick - for example, with the rich family holding their noses when the Kim father is nearby. But Parasite's lack of subtlety is a justifiable and possibly inevitable consequence of a movie that is this bold. \n\nHony Kyung-pyo's cinematography expertly captures the starkly different milieus of the two families. The Kim's semi-basement is claustrophobic and restrictive and the Park's mansion is vast and airy. I also think the shooting of the impressive flood scenes at the end of the movie deserves to be hugely commended. It is a film of impressive and important technical ability - something that I didn't expect.\n\nThere's one moment on which the movie pivots: a moment that takes the film into a place you don't foresee it going.  As the camera rushes through the black space into the basement, music reaching a crescendo, everything becomes impossibly tense. And then, moments later, the viewer begins to realise gradually what's happening. It is one of the most exciting and astounding things I've ever witnessed in the cinema.\n\nParasite is absolutely one of the year's best. It's an incredible, shockingly bold piece of film-making that is both a mainstream crowd-pleaser and an art-house wonder.",

I was going to wait to watch the film, but after realizing how many Academy Awards it was up for, I decided to give it a watch the Saturday night before the Oscars: it was the best cinematic decision I made all year. The Kim family is a sinister bunch who you root for even when you shouldn't. I could list off each character/actor, but I'll save time and just say there wasn't a weak performance among them: each played a role, each nailed the role. Symbolism abounds, as the Kims survive (I choose this word deliberately) in a subterranean lair where they have to contend with neighborhood fumigation, micturating drunkards, and typhoon floodwaters, which eventually turn their lives into a literal world of shit. The Park family, on the other hand, lives in a modern oasis that feels like it was dropped into Seoul from outer space — with plenty of lawn and garage space, I should add. The symbolism is most apparent when the help — old and new — are battling to the death in the mansion's soundproof basement while the Park family lives in ignorant bliss upstairs. The only part of the movie I wanted more clarification on was how Kim Ki-Jeong (Park So-dam) was able to control Park Da-song (Jung Hyeon-jun) from being a tornado of energy. They never really show any techniques or power (abuse) she uses to keep the child in line. You're reading this after the Oscars, so you don't need a reason to root for Bong (go watch his acceptance speeches if you haven't already), but Parasite is a must-watch that could've easily kept me engaged for another hour or two.",

            "content": "An uncategorisable masterpiece\n\nWhat is one to make of the utterly uncategorisable and impossible-to-define Parasite? Part comedy of manners, part social satire, part heist film, part thriller, part horror, part family drama, part farce, part economic treatise, part social realism, part tragedy, part allegory. What is certain is that it's exceptional in just about every way – screenplay (co-written by director Bong Joon-ho and Han Jin-won), directing, cinematography, mise en scène, editing, production design, sound design, score, acting. There's not a weak link here, in a film that achieves that rarest of things – it lives up to the hype.\n\nThe Kim family are down on their luck. Father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), mother Chung-sook (Chang Hyae-jin), daughter Ki-jeong (Park So-dam), and son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) reside in a tiny basement apartment eking out a meagre living folding pizza boxes. However, their fortunes change when Ki-Woo bluffs his way into working as an English tutor for the daughter of the wealthy Park family. Father Dong-ik, (Lee Sun-kyun), mother Yeon-gyo (Cho Yeo-jeong), daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so), and son Da-song (Jung Hyeon-jun) welcome Ki-woo into their home, and upon discovering just how wealthy the Parks are, the Kims hatch an elaborate scheme to oust the Park's current domestic staff and take their places. However, it doesn't take long before things start to go very, very awry for both families.\n\nAs thoroughly entertaining (and funny) as Parasite is, it remains an economic treatise, albeit with a savagely satirical quality. This is far from the first time Bong has dealt with issues of class, but never before has he been this caustic and acerbic, but so too compassionate and witty. One of the most deftly-handled elements of the film is his avoidance of the clichés one so often finds in films dealing with economics – the Kims are by no means a victimised family immediately worthy of sympathy, whilst the Parks are by no means a callous family immediately worthy of scorn. Rather, the Parks are depicted as perfectly friendly and pleasant whilst the Kims are shown to be liars and scoundrels.\n\nBong is uninterested in trucking in heroes and villains because such rigid diametrics aren't the norm in the real world. For all their scheming and lying, the Kims merely con their way into menial jobs, whilst the Parks' greatest crime is allowing their wealth to insulate them from the world of families such as the Kims. At the same time, the Kims are depicted as a far more loving family than the Parks. Although all four Kims often occupy the same frame, we never see the four Parks together in the same shot. Important here is the title. A simple reading is that the Kims are the parasites and the Parks are the hosts, with the Kims feeding off the Parks' wealth and status. However, Bong depicts the Parks as parasitic as well, feeding off of the labour of their servants. Just as the Kims feed off the Parks, the Parks feed off the Kims, in what is a symbiotic relationship.\n\nAesthetically, Hong Kyung-pyo's cinematography is magnificent. Hong also shot the superb Beoning (2018), and the camerawork here has a similar smoothness and restlessness, gliding through the Parks' house like it's a fifth member of the Kim family. Lee Ha-jun's production design is also praise-worthy, with the Kims' cluttered and dilapidated apartment contrasted with the Parks' pristine post-modernist semi-open plan house.\n\nIt's also in relation to production design wherein one of the film's best metaphors is to be found. As a story at least partly in the tradition of the \"upstairs/downstairs\" subgenre, Bong literalises the separation between those above and those below by using stairways as a recurring motif. The Kims' apartment has no stairs, indicating their inability to rise socio-economically. On the other hand, the Parks' home has two stairways – one going up to the bedrooms where the four children spend an increasing amount of time, cut off from their parents, and one going down into the cellar. Bong shoots this stairway like he's suddenly directing a horror film, bestowing upon it an ominousness that, at first, makes little sense, but ultimately reveals itself to be a spectacular bit of foreshadowing.\n\nParasite is a masterpiece, with Bong never putting a foot wrong. It could have been a self-serving and didactic message-movie – a homily to the honour of the poor or a deconstruction of the unhappiness of the rich – but Bong is far too talented for that, avoiding rhetorical cant. Quite unlike anything I've ever seen, it works as allegory just as well as it works as social realism just as well as it works as comedy just as well as it works as tragedy and so on. This is cinema as art, a film which has proven itself very much a game-changer and completely deserving of every bit of praise it's received.",

The plot isn't an original plot because there's a lot of films that depict society and depict what the lower class will do to survive but the way it handles those topics is original and it works so well, this film isn't just about society and classes, it's about how some lower classes are different to one another, one lower class family can be greedy and selfish whereas the other lower class family can be grateful and understanding, in some scenes, the inequality of the higher and lower classes are demonstrated very well. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this film and I can't think of a single negative thing because this film is perfect. Overall, this film is one of the best films I've seen in a cinema, it is a must watch and I highly recommend this film to anyone who is 15 or over.",

By the end, you're so familiar with the lat out or the house that the characters can run around of of it's areas and play a cat an mouse game the the audience is basically brought into.\nThe movie also has interesting things to say about class and being belitled, even when you're the smartest person in the room.\nThough the third act didn't really work for me.

It completely falls apart by the time it reaches its bloody conclusion.  This movie does boast one great scene - The Flood.  That spectacle alone might justify the time spent watching this movie.\n\n\nSpoiler Alert: Don't read further if you haven't seen the movie.\n\n\nThe Plot Holes/Give me a Break Moments \n\n1. There's no way a family that can't fold pizza boxes would have the skills to pull of their deception.  (See 4, below.)\n2. What homeowner is unaware of their bomb shelter?  Especially since such shelters are common in South Korea.\n3. The son could speak fluent English; why can't he get a real job?\n4. If the daughter is clever enough to pose as a skilled art teacher who graduated from the University of Chicago, why can't she figure out how to fold that damn pizza box? \n5. What homeowner doesn't run a basic background check on their prospective household help?\n6. The rich couple makes love on the couch while the poor family - the entire clan - hides under the nearby coffee table.  Yeah, right.\n7. Wouldn't most moviegoers feel sympathetic towards the rich gaslit family and their original staff, thus feeling disgusted and depressed at the way the movie ends?\n\n\nBig Spoiler Alert - The killer goes free.

But Bong truly revolutionizes the stairway genre by adding another vertical level to the equation. At the end of Act II, the bottom drops out—narratively and literally—and \"Parasite\" mutates into something greater. A story about two families, the upstairs and the downstairs, reveals something else lurking beneath.\n\nWith Bong as head maestro, \"Parasite\" is a film as technically accomplished as it is fascinating narratively, a real rarity. Bong has demonstrated he is a master of his craft, as well as the rhythm and tempo in which he chooses to tell his stories. From the camera movement, editing, and music, \"Parasite\" is akin to riding a frantic wave of story. The result of Bong's meticulous attention to rhythm and finely-tuned tempo is a totally immersive viewing experience. The montage at the end of Act I distills Bong's mastery as a filmmaker and storyteller into an economical sequence of about 60 shots in almost exactly 5 minutes—mesmerically paced with Hitchcockian conciseness.\n\nBong Joon Ho's \"Parasite\" is perfectly crafted and eerily topical.",

It was funny that they even called out the ominousness of the lightning, and that the lightning was purposefully not quite perfectly timed, a little more realistic.\n\nThere were a few movie gimmes, like the rich family arriving in a few minutes just after a fight. But overall, the movie did its best to maintain realistic plausibility. The violence seemed fairly realistic, with not an excess of gore or blood. The parts about the poor family feeling trapped while having to deal with the rich family's excesses with tacit acceptance was definitely heightened as the movie went on. While the initial benefits of a good job gave them much gratitude, the family's attitude seemed to wane after realizing what they had to deal with to get there. \n\nWould rewatch this again, just to catch more of the themes.",

It was eye-opening in so many ways a true morality tale, not only in the way all of the characters actions were rewarded, but also in the overall tone and story: you are meant to go away and THINK. Although it is set in another country and filmed in a foreign language, the fascinating thing about it was how universal the theme was. I cannot recommend it enough.",

Based off the title I thought their would be some crazy epidemic like boon jong hos other movie the host but nope . Just social commentary calling the parasite s poor people which is really clever. This movie is pretty clever in that way and entertaining at times. To get to the good part of the movie it took a good 25 30 minutes. What I mean is the good part is when Kevin is at the house. The acting is amazing. I’ve never seen a foreign movie to make me interested in the acting. Cause reading subtitles is kinda rough, I know first world problems but still. I know people that will agree with me. Anyway it may seem that I’m hating on this movie but it’s very entertaining but would I ever see this movie again, probably not.

How wrong can you be? Yes, even me. Despite all my preconceptions and having quickly overcome my adversity to subtitles, I really enjoyed Parasite. I had little idea of what to expect, having managed to avoid any spoilers and can confirm, it really is a film to go and see without prior expectations...I'm saying no more, as some people do still talk to me at the moment. Will it be as enjoyable on second viewing? ...I'll have to wait for the DVD release...oh, and I still think dubbing beats subtitles.",

They do everything to cheat some money out of people and are quite good at it. When they get hold of an opertunity to manifest a mantion with filthy rich people they surely does it. First one family member, then the next and the next one after that. They infest this home - in very clever ways - with different jobs - acting as professionals. Surely this must stay a secret, but that's not an easy task.\n\nThis is a very inspiring story and a film that covers most genres. It has a funny undertone, it can be dramatic and even scary at times. Later it shifts into something more dramatic. It looks magnificent and that house that most of the scenes are taken from looks amazing. Good acting, great characters and a very cleverly moving film - directorial wise. \n\nAfter the credits faded in it understood how much this film reminded me of a favorite of mine, \"Borgman\". That is a weirder and a bit more narrow film, but I kind of like that one even better. This is by no means a bad film, though - it's fantastic, actually! Probably on my top three from Bong and once again he lived up to my high expectations.\n\n9 out of 10 pizzaboxes.",

It's funny, dark and twisted.  It's one of those films that will leave a lasting impression on you  and I can guarantee you'll be thinking about it for some days after.

These motivation made no sense.  Why was there such a struggle?  The former caretaker was completely unaware of how she lost her job -- even after the so-called reveal.

Indeed, the last act was a complete muddled mess -- which ended up summarizes this movie well.   You're left scratching your head as to what does this all mean?

It deserves every award it received, especially the ones concerning the screenplay. It's one of the best original stories of the last few years, and it's written in such a brilliant manner, with beautiful visual storytelling instead of the overused exposition. An emotionally resonant message is present throughout the whole runtime, and the various tones are balanced seamlessly. Technically flawless: cinematography, score, editing... everything's absolutely perfect. Nothing is placed without purpose. Not a single line of dialogue is wasted. Bong Joon Ho is a phenomenal filmmaker, one that cares about the art and everything that comes with it. He truly put his heart and soul into this, and it would be a shame if anyone fails to watch this magnificent movie just because it's in a foreign language. Please, don't make such an awful mistake...\"",

Surely this movie gives one something to think about e.g. who is the parasite? On the surface, the poor look as if they are the parasites. However, the rich were benefitting from their service, more of a symbiotic relationship. The rich took the work of the poor to the point it felt it was entitled. Come when we want. We pay you extra. Respect. Cross the line. Who crossed the line? At first it seems like the poor family has crossed the line but at the birthday party it has really revealed it.... Despite the [spoiler]the fact that \"Jessica\" was stabbed and Kims wife was desperately fighting against the maniac, Mr. Park only cares for his unconscious son who would \"probably\" die in the next 15 min. Sure, bringing his unharmed son to hospital is more important than to rescue an blood stained girl who is at the edge of death [/spoiler]. That's also [spoiler] the reason why Kim has stabbed him: Then when his daughter got stabbed, none of them cared. Like fuck you, lets see what youll do if you got stabbed instead[/spoiler]. At this point it is hard to decide which family to like and to dislike.\nSpeaking of a different topic: The movie protrayed the discrepance between poor and rich very well e.g. the rain scene. The rich love the rain  because it cleaned the filth and brightened the day. While it destroyed the lives of the poor. Parasites don't often know they harm the host.\nI think the movie did portray the rich as gullible, simple and naive. As the wife said:\" They are not rich and nice. They are nice because they are rich\"",

The score in this movie adds so much to every scene it is in and when absent really allows the acting and natural tension of the situation to shine. I have not seen many foreign films (I can count all of them on one hand) and this movie stands out compared to many movies I have seen in the last decade. Bong Joon-ho does an outstanding job writing and directing this movie that it allows all actors to shine in their own way. There are plenty of sentimental moments that allow us to understand the family's shortcomings and a character's personality; while at the same time building up suspense as their plan begins to unravel right before our eyes. This movie is one I won't soon forget and I look forward to all future works of Bong Joon-ho. Cheers.",

The film doesn't know whether it's a comedy or a tragedy, a light romp or a political allegory. The anger, class-resentment and amorality add up to a very incoherent movie.

The power resides in the script and how photography and scenography help to the screen, but there is little music (although it plays a good role in some moments) or little acting.

Superb acting, cinematography and direction from Bong Joon-ho (Mother, Snowpiercer) who has a very distinct style. Now, for Best Picture? No. Sorry. The Joker hands down. But Best Foreign Film? Absolutely. 10/10.",

            "content": "Bong Joon Ho doesn't make a specific type of film, or rather he doesn't make a film that can be pigeonholed into a particular genre, instead he makes what can only be described as a Bong Joon Ho film. As with his previous films, Snowpiercer and Okja, social critiques disguised as sci-fi thrillers, Parasite is a giddy blend of conflicting themes and tonal shifts. It begins as a tongue-in-cheek comedy about the class system in South Korea – or really, anywhere in the world, giving it an instant sense of timely significance – and then, like a magic trick, effortless slips into a claustrophobic home-invasion thriller. The cheeky grin that welcomes you into the film becomes something altogether more uncomfortable and difficult to pin down. In the same way that the Park family are duped by the Kims, the audience are tricked into settling in for one film and slapped with an entirely different one half-way through, with all the doors locked and the only way out is to scramble over the bodies. It is a film that only Bong Joon Ho could make.\n\nOn the surface, Parasite is a simple film to describe – it's about a lower-class family latching onto a wealthy family and draining their resources, in the same way a parasite infiltrates and infects its host. Dig a little deeper and it's clear that this is not a film about good and bad morality, it's grey and murky, and if you poke it, as Bong Joon-Ho does with a dash of Hitchcock-inspired mayhem, blood spills.\n\nSong Kang Ho, in utterly captivating form, is Ki-taek — head of the Kim family. They live in a damp and messy basement house that's literally half-way below ground, often providing perfect view from their living room of the local drunk who urinates from above. They scurry around for high ground so they can leach off neighbouring Wi-Fi spots, and the film begins in a moment of brief panic when they can no longer find any. Fortunately, if they clamber to the top of their toilet seat, perhaps where the internet belongs, WhatsApp beams back into their existence. These aren't dim people and Bong makes it clear from the start that despite their economic status, these are ambitious, talented, crafty individuals. They are so resourceful that Ki-taek has them leave the window open as pest control spray the street, the gas flooding through into their home, engulfing the family and killing their pest problem in the process.\n\nOpportunity strikes, and sometimes that's all you need, when Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) gets a job offer from his university student friend who makes money tutoring rich kids. He's going away and needs somebody to take over. Ki-woo agrees and the Kim family put their audacious plan into place. Fancy paperwork later, artistically designed by his talented sister Ki-jung (Park So-dam), Ki-woo is marching up to the Park family estate that sits high up in the hills, fitted with electronic doors and fortress-like walls. Not long before he convinces simple but well-meaning house wife Yeon-Kyo ( Cho Yeo Jeong) that he's an esteemed tutor, she makes the point that her artistic son is struggling with trauma, and so he recommends Ki-jung for an art-therapist role, pretending they don't know each other. One by one, the Kim family wriggle their way into the Park home, sending the previous employees to the streets, and so the roles and fortunes are beginning to change. But this a Bong-Joon Ho film, and with delighted content comes a crushing reality, and this is slammed home with the film's poignant final shot. None of this can last.\n\nThe way it out all plays out is wickedly fun, as the Kim family deceive the Parks in a variety of ingenious ways. To the script's credit, which had it win a Bafta for original screenplay, none of the scenarios seem implausible. And while it's as enjoyable as a caper-comedy, there is a grimness to the way the Park family, blinded by their wealth and self-importance, have been so easily swindled and invaded. Move an inch past the comedy, as Bong-Joon Ho does with razor-sharp ease, and Parasite becomes a deeply uncomfortable film about privacy and social hierarchy. Does that make the Kim family the villains here? It's not clear and obvious. After all, they just want a better life for themselves, and nobody's getting hurt yet. On the other hand, you have the Park family who are rich and openly recoil at those beneath them, even insisting that the Kim family all have a certain smell that defines them – a call back to the stench of the stink bugs eradicated earlier in the film. And yet, the Parks are not bad people, they love their son and daughter – like Ki-taek, Dong-ik (Lee Sun Kyun) simply wants the best for his family, and he gives them that with the money he earns. As the film reaches its wild finale, the grin that started the film shifting into a grimace, the answer to which family is the parasite becomes even harder to reach.\n\nAs with the best of Bong, there is magic to the way everything comes together. Parasite is much more than an entertaining genre mash-up with a brilliant script. It's a crisp and clean clockwork machine, made up of ideas all working together and executed seamlessly to create an indefinable but very special whole. The title is metaphorical, something that Ki-woo reiterates throughout, but Parasite could equally apply to the way the spaces of the Park home get inside of you before you even realise the camerawork is doing anything special. The house is a stunning creation with all the intricacies and character of a stage play, of which Parasite was once planned to be, but Bong scrapped that when he began writing the script and could only see the possibilities of an expertly placed camera. He was right and cinematographer Hong Kyung-pyo, fresh from Burning, and in another career highlight, defines every single space in the Park home with the same love and attention that's gone into the script. None of this is explicitly done. It all happens through the introduction of the different characters and their interaction with each layer of the house. Everything has been thought out and how the families occupy the space, from the cosy but cramped Kim home to the wide-open Park house, which has its basement entrance cast in permanent darkness against the bright glow of the kitchen lights, as if anything below this level of the house is a home for something evil. Yeon-Kyo suggests as such by telling Ki-jung that her son's trauma came from there. Again, everything in the film, from its script to its set design, feeds back to its themes of class warfare.\n\nNobody can stop talking about Parasite, and nobody should. It's the rare film that is both an absolute riot and a complicated dissection of current real-world issues. It's funny, sad, uncomfortable and violent. It's a Bong Joon Ho film, it's his best yet, and nobody is doing cinema quite like this.",

A couple of key lines by the wealthy businessman about his driver were \"He gets close to the line (of acting improperly for his station in life) but doesn't cross it.\" and \"He smells like the people on the subway... like an old radish. I haven't been on the subway in years.\" These statements along with the way other household staff were dismissed, showed a total lack of the concept of human dignity, whatever the station in life. And it is the wealthy man's crinkling of his nose in disgust at the odor from a lower-class character that leads to the climactic event near the end of the movie. There is such good story telling and character development that you overlook a lot of the deeper commentary until you are sitting in your quiet car afterward, musing about all the things you have seen. I generally don't like dark comedies, but this was a true masterpiece and I will definitely go view it again to catch some of the subtle nuances that I must have missed the first time around.",

I just finished watching it and I don't know if I can properly articulate how good it is or why because I'm running on such a high right now. It's all good. Everything. The writing, the acting, the directing, the framing, the editing, the plot, the dialogue; there literally isn't a single fault. It's perfectly executed and I love it\n\nEverything it says about society and culture: the way we idolize the wealthy, how apathetic they are to our struggles, how a proximity to wealth can make us turn on our own in pursuit of status, how capitalism works to dehumanize us, how our own advancement comes at the expense of others, how the rich live and the poor merely survive, how the wealthy force us into competition with each other, how expendable we are to the bourgeois class in a capitalist society, how distant our two worlds can seem from each other even if they're only a few subway stops away. I can write an extensive essay on any one of those points. It's smart, it's funny, it's dark, it's deep, it's philosophical, it's tragic; it's all the things.\n\nI was engaged from the first scene to the last. The family was so easy to root for because anyone who's ever lived through hardship can relate to what they're going through. Every poor person has dreamed about being a rich person. To live how the other half lives, even if just for a moment. They get a nice gig, but it ends up being too good to be true. My heart was racing for basically the last hour of the film because something happens that I can't say and the story goes from a light-hearted romp about a family cleverly scheming their way into a better situation to something completely different in an instant.\n\nI honestly can't say too much more without giving anything away, but god do I want to make everyone I know watch it so I can talk about all the great themes. The beautiful, beautiful themes! I can't recommend it highly enough. If subtitles normally deter you, give it a chance anyway. Like Bong Joon Ho, the writer/director of the movie and winner of many Oscars, said, \"Once you overcome the 1-inch-tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films\". This has actually inspired me to watch more foreign language media going forward, which I've always hesitated to do. Because if my prejudice has kept me from seeing gems like this all these years, then I want to correct that as soon as possible. \n\nYou can rent it on Amazon Prime for $4, so I suggest you do that and see it immediately. Like right now. Skip class. Call out of work. Watch Parasite.\n\nIn conclusion: Eat the Rich like Ram Don 🍜",

            "content": "Best movie of 2019 by far. Biting social subtext, brilliantly layered editing, masterful and witty dialogue, a perfectly utilized score, and impeccable directing created one of my favorite films ever. One should go into this film with at least a basic understanding of the current socioeconomic climate of South Korea. The fundamental issue at hand is the immense discrepancy between the resources and fiscal opportunities available to the lower class and the lavish lives of the wealthy. Throughout the film, the Kims (lower class) and the Parks (upper class) are masterfully juxtaposed through both overt and subtle means in order to best emphasize the class strife present in South Korea. One such instance was the monsoon sized rain storm towards the end of the film. The Parks see the rainstorm as beautiful and their son even camps outside in a clearly expensive tent. The Kims, however, return to the sub-levels of their residence to find their beloved basement home irreparably damaged and flooded. In the wake of this disaster, the Parks opt to celebrate and throw a party for their beloved son and ask that the Kims, who are sleeping in a public rec center, (unbeknownst to the Parks) to attend. This stark contrast underscores the animosity and resentment felt by the lower classes as their struggles are completely ignored and tossed aside by the wealthy, a situation not at all dissimilar from the current socioeconomic conditions in the United States. Bong Joon Ho deserved every bit of lauding and praise that he received for this masterpiece. His extensive story-boarding paved the way for a masterclass in editing by Yang Jin-Mo, whose 'frankensteinish' work with some scenes gave the best representation of the actor's gripping performances. Bong Joon Ho's masterful directing is on full display throughout the whole film but is best represented by one sequence. All I ask is that you watch the roughly five-minute long 'peach' sequence and tell me this movie isn't at the apex of cinema today. The editing, directing, score, and acting were... impeccable. The passage of time felt like a breeze despite the immense weight and importance of the sequence to the overall narrative. Callbacks to earlier moments in the SEQUENCE (not even the film itself) were incredible and rewarding. If you didn't notice, play close attention to the hot sauce packets used during the sequence and you'll see what I mean. The entire cast was superb and their win for best ensemble at the BAFTA's is unfortunately the most award recognition they will receive for their effort. Seriously, if you haven't seen this film, do yourself a huge favor and watch it by any means possible. This is a movie that will stand the test of time and is an instant classic.",

It was well made. Lovely cinematography & editing. The story however... ugh. This was a hard movie to watch, but not in a 'Life is Beautiful' kind of way. There was no one to root for. I disliked how everyone behaved. I thought people made irrational and terrible choices. Indeed, I had a hard time finishing it, because I found it utterly depressing. It felt futile, and I didn't feel like I was entertained so much as exposed to the worst bits of human nature without any glint of redemption. Sometimes, a movie can be thought provoking, and make you feel like you've gained access into an alternate POV that is worth considering/examining/learning from. Not this movie. It just made me feel sad for every (contrived) situation & character. It wasn't over the top enough to be on par with a Tarantino movie, and it didn't have enough heart to compete with movies like 'Life is Beautiful.' I don't think it's worthy of Best Picture, but then again I don't think critics are very masterful in their critiques these days. They're too concerned with what they ought to say and not in touch with their actual feelings and perceptions about the storytelling that they're witnessing.",

When I saw it in the theater, there were only 4 other people in the theater with me. And, let me tell you, all 5 of us were equal parts mesmerized, riveted, laughing, horrified, moved and we all gave it a standing ovation at the end. All 5 of us 🤣 It went to surprising and did-not-see-it-coming places few films dare to go in these days of comic book blockbusters and franchise overkill; and it did so with verve, style, heart and vision. This film totally and completely blew me away. THIS MOVIE IS AMAZING. REALLY AN UNBELIEVABLY GREAT MOVIE. And though the expression tends to be thrown around way to loosely these days, it really is A TRUE MODERN MASTERPIECE. It actually reminded me of the very first time I saw Tarantino's Pulp Fiction (who also wrote, directed and produced his own film just like Joon Ho did with Parasite). Where I knew I was watching a special film from someone who's talent, vision and execution was unique, and their art was not able to be duplicated (although imitated it has been). On a level all their own, a masterful level. That their vision is one of a kind. *Parasite* was that powerful to me and I had that strong of a reaction to it. Because it's so well layered, gut punch powerful and masterfully crafted that it cannot be denied; and it's impossible to look away, even when the tides turn in unexpected directions you may not have seen coming. Not only is it the hands down best movie of the year, but one of the greatest films I've seen in the past decade; and one of the best films I've seen in my lifetime. It💯deserved to win for Best Picture. Actually, it's one of the few Best Picture winners of recent memory that's actually an outstanding film. Just didn't think the stuffy, stuck up Academy would actually give it to Bong Joon Ho as he deserved. But they did. And I was ecstatic. For once, the actual best picture actually won Best Picture. Watch it-and fall in love with cinema and the power of masterful storytelling all over again❤️.",

It remembered me movies like mother!, or Martyrs, even if i know it's a totally different thing. I'm also happy that Parasite won so many Oscars, it's nice to see this kind of meritocracy for a non American movie.",

The poor—so desparate to survive or to be seen as human—sacrifice morality and safety for a glimmer of living it up for just one day.  Be careful what you wish for!  “The best plan is to have no plan.” This quote from the patriarch of the poor family painfully punctuates his total loss of hope and his way of self-preservation.

I found it pleasant and amusing up to approximately two thirds of its duration. In the first part of the movie we are confronted with the ability of the \"poor\" to scam the \"rich\" and a comic presentation of the \"rich\" exposing their naivety and manias. The plot seems to change in nature after the servants  are lead down to the underground bunker by the former housekeeper. In fact that moment is a turning point into chaos -- of the plot, I mean. My limit of disbelief was then reached. Moreover, none of the interpretations of the movie that I've read about in other reviews (e.g. a metaphor of class struggle, a concern with wild capitalism, climate change, and whatever) seems reasonable or applicable, because they are not compatible with the story and  characters' description so far. My interpretation is that, simply, the final sections of the script are uninspired and pointless. \nI learnt with surprise, the day after having seen the movie, that Parasite won the Oscar for the best film.",

Many of the plot devices are contrivances used by the the director to make his satirical points. I'm avoiding specific examples here, so my review will be free of spoilers, but the \"lucky\" rock is one example of these contrivances. The punishments meted out in the denouement of the film did not seem justified, as the characters who suffered did not seem greatly evil.

Yes, you have what amounts to entire family of parasite weasels pray upon a wealthy family and proceed to destroy their innocent yet aloof and semi-snobbish lives. At best this movie is a 'try hard' class based social commentary dark comedy... perhaps, but I found it to be utterly insulting and see no reason to every view it again. I bought it via iTunes and chalked it up as a rare regret, I typically buy movies I already know I like and want to add to my movie collection. The movie tries to be clever, but I end up just hating everything about it. If these loathsome characters had an ounce of humanity or integrity within them they could have averted more needless pain and suffering but the movie plays out and your expected to give a damn about human bums and scum who destroyed an innocent family's world. I don't even want to get into specifics and look up the character names, it's not worthy of such scrutiny. The movie is pointless, there's not reason to watch it ever again.",

            "content": "It's rare for a foreign film to gain as much popularity with American audiences as the South Korean film Parasite has done. It's even rarer for a foreign film to earn Academy Awards nominations for Best Foreign Language (now called International) film and Best Picture, but Parasite has managed to join this exclusive club. Director Bong Joon-ho has long been turning out top quality, intriguing work (I'm a big fan of his melancholy 2003 film Memories of Murder, about a years long hunt for a serial killer). Bong Joon-ho and Han Jin-won's Oscar nominated original screenplay switches tones and even genres so abruptly and successfully, it makes Parasite a unique movie to say the least. Combined with a stellar cast, excellent cinematography, production design, and pacing, Parasite becomes a thoroughly engrossing, extraordinary experience. Movies like this in any language are rare indeed.\n\nParasite begins as a dark comedy and sharp satire about economic inequality and class disparity. The Kim family lives in a shabby basement apartment. The street level window provides them a view of ankles and urinating drunks. They work short term odd jobs and hunt around their apartment for a spot with Wi-Fi. A change in luck comes when a friend of their teenage son recommends him as a tutor for the daughter of a wealthy family, the Parks. The son, Ki-woo, reluctantly accepts though he is under qualified. Soon the Kim family schemes to replace each of the Park family servants with themselves though they pose under false identities. The 20-ish Kim daughter, Ki-jeong, provides the family with false credentials. Things take a fateful and irreversible turn when the Kims decide to have a night in luxury while the Parks are away for the weekend.\n\nThat plot description seems to make the title describe the Kim family. As you watch them work their way into the home of the Park family, you may find the title applies more to the Parks whose lifestyle requires people like the Kims. The differences between a family that is oblivious of their wealth and a family that schemes to get stable, working-class jobs is apparent. But then, the film reveals layers and depth that make it truly profound. When the film becomes a riveting thriller, it does not eschew its themes and substance. I cannot recall the last time I had no idea where a film was going, not because of incompetence, but because I was watching the work of a master filmmaker.\n\nThe entire ensemble is terrific. Each role is well cast and there's a great chemistry between the members of the respective families. The stand outs for me, however are Song Kang-ho as the Kim family patriarch and Park So-dam as his clever daughter. Cho Yeo-jeong as the daffy and gullible Park matriarch is great comic relief.\n\nWhat sets Parasite a step above other socially conscious films is it does not sacrifice entertainment for the sake its social commentary or vice versa. It never pontificates or pretends to have any didactic solution. It is like a classic Twilight Zone episode, up front about its themes but in such a way that doesn't speak down to audience and feels detached and immediate simultaneously. There is not a single pandering moment in the entire film. Parasite uses the real problems and concerns of modern society to tell a compelling and universal story that causes us to reflect on our world. That can be the definition a great film and great art.",

            "content": "Parasite is a dark comedy that is smart, relatable and thought provoking. Spoilers ahead! Weeks after watching Parasite in full color, I watched it again in black & white. I prefer the color version and the movie left a lot for the audience to reflect on afterwards. Relatable in the sense that the rich get richer and the poor are left to fend for themselves, it can also reflect on country relationships between S. Korea and other Asian nations alongside the US. South Korea has come a long way in terms of its economic advances but you take the magnifying glass and will realize that many young people there are still not able to get jobs and richer people have access to resources and tutoring programs that make a huge difference in advancement such as tough college entrance exams. Both SK and US have questionable leaders of both countries where it is uncertain if they lead on the interest of its citizens or the interests of their own party/financial interests. In an age where anyone can google, gullible characters fall for a multi-phased manipulative plans initially seeming innocent enough. There's references to \"crossing the line\" meaning class clashes between character families. The class difference is noted via \"smell\" which is akin to sub basement dwellings or the subways. There are some reflective moments of happiness in the movie where characters look at the sky from home, relax at a modern home which is not theirs \"this is our home right now\" or share laughter over family meals in tiny kitchens or taxi driver restaurants. It's almost like the director is teaching us to enjoy the moment and the little things because it is all so fleeting. The struggling daughter pleads with her father to \"just worry about us\" which could be in reference to international relations or an omen for upcoming provocation. Planning is a key theme throughout the movie where initial plans fall into multiple phases. The struggling father eventually notes that no plan makes for no disappointment or a plan that never fails- which seems to me like just giving up. Hasn't he heard the saying that a poor plan is better than no plan? Water represents a lot in the movie from pouring rain to flooding. Flooding occurs where the struggling daughter climbs up to the highest point in her family apartment which happens to be a toilet spewing sewage. She climbs on top of the toilet seat and holds it down as she smokes a cigarette and sewage seeps through the lid under her legs. There's this landscape rock the struggling family receives as a gift and it represents the possibility of wealth. It's used as a weapon and then finally laid back on a river bed where water washes over the rock. Perhaps this means that to this struggling family, wealth may seem attainable but there  are layers of water between them and the rock. The struggling son also notes that the rock tends to follow him. The high point of the struggling family is when all four are hired to work. It makes you wonder how much the rich family pays for them collectively. But also what does it means at a country level because who really is getting the short end of the stick? Who's the fool? Or are we all fools? Who's the bad guy or are we all bad? Only the youngest child in the movie seems to have any semblance of normalcy where he plays freely (but gets criticized for it) and where he feels and reacts (but then gets labeled as traumatized for it). As we all get older do all our views of the world get tainted and judged? Who's the parasite or host? Or are we all just parasites wanting things of each other?",

You're supposed to connect with the main characters. Build an emotional connection with them. So you can become one with the movie. Especially when it's about a poor family compared to a rich family. Ho does something different. He keeps the Parks, the Kims, and the audience separate from each other. You see the struggles the Kims go through everyday, but you don't really feel sorry for them. Then you have the Parks. They're the victims and they don't deserve what happens to them, but they deserve so much more. For the audience, Ho takes you on a roller coaster. He shows you the peaks you can have when you're on top. Then within seconds show the valleys of poverty. Which creates the struggle inside you. Ho keeps letting you get close to connecting to any character then pulls you back to neutral. That makes for a fantastic watch. You're on the edge of your seat from the start. Then want to see what the next step they'll take. I love that. The only thing I really don't like is, Korean Yelp would've stopped this whole thing. That's not enough for me not to like this movie. It stands out in recent memory actually. Overall it's the best nominated movie I've seen so far this year. Grade Santa. 5 out of 5 beards",

But will this change the life of the poor family?\n\nDIRECTOR: Bong Joon Ho\nSCREENWRITERS: Bong Joon Ho, Han Jin Wan\nCAST: Song Kang Ho, Lee Sun Kyun, Cho Yeo Jeong, Choi Woo Shik, Park So Dam, Lee Jung Eun, Chang Hyae Jin\nIn the movie, we follow the Kim family who doesn't have much money. By chance, the son in the family starts working for the wealthy Park family. He teaches their daughter English. Now the rest of the family sees opportunities to make money, and they have a plan to remove the rest of the staff who work for the wealthy Park family and then take the jobs themselves.\n\nBong Joon Ho addresses deeper themes, but he always manages to create entertainment and some surprising scenes that bring out the smile. The movie is mostly charming until the Kim family discovers the big secret of the house.\n\nThen the movie starts to get darker, and it explodes into a wonderful finale where we see and understand the message of the movie. The title of the movie turns things on its head. Because what I thought to be quite obvious at the beginning of the movie is turned upside down and I got an aha experience. Parasites are found in all classes of society.\n\nFrom a technical aspect I think this was a beautifully crafted film from the direction to the cinematography. There are so many beautiful scenes in the movie, and it's pretty well done considering that most of the action takes place inside the big house and the not so big garden.My favorite sequence is when the Kim family has to run home when the rain is pouring down, and you feel like they're on board the Titanic. They must run from the top and down to the engine room. What a wonderful sequence, and it's so beautiful to watch!\n\nThe cast was fantastic, and everyone fit the needs of their roles. The characters were well-written with the performances complementing that perfectly. It does a great job of creating a collection of characters that feel like real people, whom despite their eccentricities, maintained a grounded, realistic feel.The musical score complements the scenes nicely and elevates the emotional responses without feeling overbearing.\n\nSo, if you like foreign films, thrillers, or movies that can make you think a little check this one out. It's a crisp film from a technical aspect, and with a blend of great writing and acting you can't go wrong. It was a solid film that treats the audience with intelligence. 9/10",

If you're looking for something new, fresh, seat-gripping, deep and beautiful, then I urge you to go see Parasite. Bong Joon-ho (Snowpiercer) is a tour-de-force. It was quite the feeling to be in a theater full of strangers by myself and have the shared experience of leaning forward at the same time, clasping our hands to our mouths in shock and sitting in silence during emotionally powerful moments. You can't get that experience at home. The cinematagraphy was sharp, meticulous and metaphorical (inside joke with the movie). The performances and the writing were delicious. There is plenty of honest humor that dances in between the white knuckled dramatic tension. And boy is there suspense! Can't say it enough, GO SEE THIS MOVIE!",

            "content": "The term \"masterpiece\" can sometimes be so commonly used in a movie review that the word begins to lose its prestige. However, I believe I've seen a film that just might be worthy of the term. So, here's my spoiler free Parasite movie review explaining why it just might be a masterpiece.\n\nParasite is a film that manages to be funny, creative, unpredictable, heart wrenching, and is extremely thought-provoking. Additionally, it's able to balance multiple tones successfully at the same time with great performances. \n\nI love how this film pulls common elements used in comedies, dramas, and moments of suspense. Then, mixes them effectively to specific moments to make us feel different emotions throughout the film. It's as if the story is more concerned with being as real, and transparent as humanly possible. It can connect to us on multiple levels instead of focusing on just one emotion or genre. I also love this aspect because as humans we don't operate on one emotion at a time. Sometimes it can be mixed, and sometimes it can vary from moment to moment. So, Parasite balances this perfectly.\n\nAfter the film was over, I was left sitting there while the credits rolled to let the film completely overtake me. I reflected on all of the themes, story, plot, characters, and etc that really impacted me. Parasite is truly a rare experience that stayed with me for several weeks afterwards even after the credits rolled.\n\nGoing into this film I didn't know much about the Director, Bong Joon-ho. However, I want to see more of his filmography as his directing in Parasite is just immaculate.\n\n*Since this review I've seen Snowpiercer, and Okja. Both films are incredible, and Bong Joon-ho is climbing up the chart as one of my personal favorite Directors.\n\nThematically, I found this film to be one of the most relatable films of 2019. It explores universal themes of poverty, wealth, and family which may seem simple on paper, but the plot of the story is what makes it interesting. Side note, it's also best that I don't say much about the plot because I think it's best to go into this film not knowing much. So, as a result, it made the film unpredictable which is extremely difficult to accomplish. With that being said, the story, and the plot is able to apply the themes creatively without feeling like it's beating you over the head to get the message across.\n\nParasite has performances that are amazing. Each actor and actress are able to organically go through different emotions as if these characters are real people. The family felt like a real family, and I felt like I knew each member of the family individually due to each being well developed. This is also because we get to spend a good amount of time with each family member.\n\nThe music is incorporated perfectly for scenes that were intended to be funny, serious, and suspenseful without being pretentious. The music also doesn't overshadowing the performance.\n\nWhat do I mean by a perfectly unscripted script? Well, to me. Parasite was so well crafted that I truly didn't know what would happen next. That's a rare feeling that I crave in a film and Parasite is so refreshing in that regard. This also speaks to the originality of the script as well. The first act sets us up for a great payoff. The script has great symbolism and metaphors without overly complicating it with dialogue. The plot services the characters development throughout the story. Then, what I love the most is that it truly feels like a story going from one event to the next without a plan. That is the pinnacle of amazing writing, and the following quote from the film explains the narrative perfectly.\n\n\"You know what kind of plan never fails? No plan at all.\"\n\nI highly enjoyed this film so much I could literally write much more, and I still wouldn't be able to explain how great this film is. So, you'll just have to see it for yourself.",

            "content": "Reflections on Cross-Cultural Issues in the Film 기생충 (Parasite)\n\nHere are a few reflections about the South Korean film by Bong, Joon-ho called 기생충 (Parasite). Some unique Korean cultural differences could get lost to many Western audiences. Reflecting on them is the main goal of this writing. Remember, these are one person's opinions, take them or leave them. Spoiler alerts. If you haven't seen the movie, then go watch it and then read this afterward.\n\nThe biggest shock to most Westerners when they see the two poor families at each others' throats is, why not work together in order to fulfill each of their purposes to get wealthy and be comfortable? There is enough wealth for everybody.\n\nIt's an excellent question. One of the cultural distinctions of Korea is that there are many ways that people find their identity. It can be in a family, a circle, a class, etc. But if there is neither a history of Jeong  (Shared heart), or Hahn (Shared suffering), then it's hard for strangers to connect empathetically.\n\nYet one might ask: both families are poor; surely the Kim family should be able to feel \"Hahn\" for the other family. Maybe so, but consider that the Kims are in a semi-basement (some have described as Purgatory), whereas the old man is living in the basement bunker (Hell), they are in very different places where the Kims are still able to look down on them both socially and geographically.\n\nAnother observation is the city of Seoul comes across as being very \"post-Christian\"~ very much a secular city. Nietzsche wrote that when God is dead; man is dead; the universe is unchained; one is left staring into a dark abyss. The only thing left to exercise is the will to power. We see this in the movie.\n\nThere is no morality. One can freely print up a fake university diploma off of the Internet and Photoshop it to one's own liking. One is free to be the impostor and just \"fake it until you make it\".\n\nSome others have made the observation that the rain water (and the sewage) flows downward; that Global Warming has caused the poor down below to become flooded out of their homes… and the rich way up above are oblivious to it… Just like back during the French Revolution, you can hear Marie Antoinette saying the proverbial …\"Let them eat cake!\"\nNoticing some of the cultural differences can be a challenge. \"Parasite\" is a wonderful dark comedy that is very unique. It's surprisingly anxiety-provoking and enjoyable. It is also thought-provoking. If you have not seen it yet, I would highly recommend it to you!\n\nYvon Malenfant",

But GOOD GOD ALMIGHTY 😱 i am shocked & thrilled by the darkness of its core. Because as the story progress it gets much more serious, much more unbelievable! I am still feeling the effects of excessive amount of laughter & jaw drops i had with this movie. Its one of those movies where you are recovering from one jaw dropping moment & then they throw you an another Jaw dropping moment 😂. \n\nParasite is a beautiful movie, extremely well directed, with great acting & amazing cinematography.

There is a picture of poverty here, but I would rather have seen a documentary on social inequality in South Korea than this strange sham statement on the subject. A talented but impoverished family commits crimes, and the people who gained wealth legitimately are first swindled and ultimately sacrificed, apparently for disliking how poor people smell as a breaking point. The twists were clever, but not clever enough for five stars, and certainly not clever enough for me to enjoy the movie. Lazy random malevolence does not make a good thriller, and the ultimate moral message here was to never plan anythingi in life, because plans cannot be carried through. I have no interest in \n\nOther than the filming, and the excellent construction of constant tension, one other nice touch was the music.

            "content": "Spoilers within: The title is layered, and the piece has three or four layers. A masterpiece of both heartfelt respect and sadness for life as it is lived, and a biting social critique of how stratification in society can literally lead to explosions that can be lethal. The title:  Who is the parasite? The manipulative poor finding immoral ways to weasel into the lives and onto the payrolls of the rich? Or the inconsiderate rich putting up with the poor whom they hire at low wages to do one form or another of their dirty work? Or yet again, are the family of four who work for the rich family, and the former housekeeper and her hubby who is hiding in the basement illustrating yet another kind of parasite: the poor sucking blood off of the poor? When the rich family went camping, and the four related servants took over the living room and lived if for a short time like the rich, in their house on the hill, the crystal palace with a whole wall of glass looking out onto the green of a well-kept yard, you just knew they would screw this up by drinking, eating, excess and messing up the place. Shouldn't they have been more careful not to jeopardize their dishonestly won jobs in the mansion? Alas, therein lies their fatal flaws. People don't always take care to think of everything, maybe those poorer less than others, due to bigger worries, like how to eat, or attitudes born of the big stresses of living on the edge. Beneath the surface, things are boiling so badly, that when the man in the cellar,  whose wife is abused by the servant family, emerges into the daylight, it is with a knife with murder on his mind, and he does kill the young woman in the servant family. But more surprisingly, her Dad then stabs and kills the rich guy who employs him as a driver. The guy in the cellar of the mansion? A perfect symbol of a stratified society with the rich in the upstairs quarters, a poor man in the downstairs. And when the two-dead birthday party incident plays out in the lush back yard with dozens of guests, the mom and son in the servant family end up on probation for offenses of tricking the rich family into hiring all four in the family, the daughter is dead, and the Dad, now a fugitive from justice for having killed his rich boss, has assumed the position as the cellar dweller in the rich people's house. Upstairs, downstairs again, ship of fools.  At the end, the aspiration of his son is to get rich, buy the house, and let Dad come into the upstairs quarters with him and mom, smash that rich/poor line. It is done as a dream, as in, dream on, that won't ever happen. The class split and the economic roles are too baked in the cake -- in Korea or Pittsburgh. A key line comes from the servant mom who is the housekeeper. Hubby calls the rich woman nice. And she says: \"She's nice because she's rich.\" The rich guy tells his wife that the driver doesn't smell good but that when he talks, he \"does not cross the line.\" The line between rich and poor, boss and help. I was left thinking by the behavior we see that people are pretty much the same everywhere, rich and poor, unconcerned and stressed, and prone to huge mistakes and devastating possibilities. And this had some really funny parts, too.",

A very sad state of cinema expectations indeed.\n\nSo maybe that explains the high Parasite rating.  Is the general audience grading on a curve?  \n\nParasite is an entertaining enough film, but that's where it ends.  It isn't deep and it isn't memorable.  Its not ground-breaking, it doesn't have amazing acting, or fantastic visuals, or some crazy good plot line.  It really is just an OK film.

There seemed to be a lot of unintended lulls that weren't useful. A 30 min shorter recut would make this the kind of movie you'd would want to own. Instead it is a movie you should definitely, definitely see but probably won't want to see again.",

The acting is top class and should all really be Oscar nominated as each character is developed and lethally uses in mouth watering situations building to a resonant finale that shocks and excites.

            "content": "Let me start by saying I'm an American who's been to South Korea many times and I understand the culture and politics quite well. further, my wife is from South Korea directly. This movie is seriously overhyped. I think many film critics and fans who knew nothing about the culture in South Korea just enjoyed the suspense thriller without putting any thought or analysis to why they liked it. No one's expecting a documentary when you're watching a suspense thriller but so many aspects of the plot were beyond contrived. I am going to post some spoilers in the next paragraph to point this out so please avoid the rest of this review if you don't want to know what happens. It is absolutely shocking this awful film is up for best picture of the year ### So we meet the Kim family, destitute & living in a cramped basement apartment. The mother father and their two adult children, none of them have a full-time job despite being educated, at least the children are. This is completely unrealistic in a modern city like Seoul. instead the family works together to fold pizza boxes to make their living? Ridiculous. The Park family has all this opulence and wealth, yet they seem completely incapable of getting any referrals or references for the various positions they need filled in their home? there's no way they would allow a family of grifters to come in and literally manipulate the family and get all the positions. to this end, this contrived plot line that Mrs Park is worried about her son and sees his art as a cry for help based on the fact that supposedly he saw a ghost when he was six in the house was nonsense. This film was popular among those who like to see class warfare. The poor Kim family appears to be not responsible for their crimes and it shows them as scrappy survivors who can outsmart and out manipulate the Park family when it suits them. One of the most ridiculous aspects of this, is that they're not successful or smart enough to fit into modern Korean society yet they have the sophistication and the planning to go into this elaborate lie and manipulation with the Park family? Near the end of the film, there is a huge rainstorm. Supposedly it is so bad, that the poor areas in Seoul are completely flooded out, including raw sewage being sprayed all over the Kim's apartment. This isn't 1960s South Korea and this is literally impossible in modern-day Seoul. It's sad and pathetic that this filmmaker, who's from the city, decides to put this metaphor into the plot as if the poor and downtrodden in the city are crapped upon by the elite. So in the middle of the night there's this horrible rain storm and the Kim family sneaks out in the middle of the night to go back to their own home. They did this without transportation walking or running in the streets assuming it's not such a short distance from the opulent neighborhood the Parks live in. after showing scenes of them in the home and trying to rescue some other things suddenly they're in some sort of city evacuation center with others spending the rest of the night? I don't think there's enough time in a day let alone the middle of the night to move around like this! The Park family wakes up and spontaneously decides to have a birthday party during the day for their son? No planning whatsoever and yet they get on the phone and tons of people show up along with catered food and musical accompaniment? Of course that morning they're also able to get the entire Kim family to come back to help out with the party? Could it get any more ridiculous? The filmmaker continues his thinly veiled hatred towards people of success by having the Park family have a native american-themed children's party for their son. with Mr Kim and the father supposedly dressed in his Indians with tomahawks to attack Kim's daughter as she brings out the cake in front of everyone...🙄 Suddenly, there's a lot of chaos and violence, which I'll leave mostly unexplored in this review, yet Mr Kim is insulted when Mr Park takes offense to the way another poor person smells and he decides to kill Mr Park! There's a whole other aspect to the film with a secret bunker under the home that the Park family is completely unaware of. considering there would be a real estate transaction for this home, there's no way they would be unaware of this major apparatus complete with running water and electricity below their own home that's accessible through a cabinet in their finished basement. This whole film is just an allegory by the director on how much hatred and contempt he has for people of success and wealth. He's crafted a film that has very little meaning, little purpose, inconsistent tone, and very basic acting that's not nearly as nuanced or interesting as others make it sound to be. For this film to be nominated for a best picture award and to win lots of other awards at other film competitions is a testament to how politics seeps into reviewers' minds. This director Bong Joon-ho has truly very little talent, yet the critics loved his film of a few years ago called Okja too. I really challenge anyone to watch that film as well as this one and conclude this filmmaker has anything worthy of sharing with an audience. Right now, Korean music, food, and culture are trendy, and I get it as there are many wonderful aspects to this country's rich and interesting traditions. yet a film like parasite is so polarizing and so preachy with its class warfare messages that the filmmaking seems completely secondary.",

The big difference between these two families is completely astonishing, I truly loved it. Plus, the acting was something phenomenal.

In this movie it quite literally is. This is the best movie of 2019 and will most likely be the best movie of 2020. If it doesn't win \"Best Picture\" the Oscars are even more of a joke than they already are. The title says so much more about the movie that I can here.

Some humor is sprinkled in as Ki-woo (Choi Woo-Shik) scans the ceiling and windows for some unprotected (or underprotected) wi-fi to steal as the unemployed family can't afford phone service and they need it to find work. Their partially underground dwelling is susceptible to various indignities from drunken pee and bug killing gasses to flood. When they do get a gig assembling pizza boxes, they can't seem to get it right for some reason. Their luck changes when Ki-woo's friend Min (Seo-joon Park) passes his tutoring job on to him. I little fib and a lot of confidence, and the money starts flowing in to the Kim family. But then he sees an in for his sister Ki-jung (So-dam Park). I suppose simply introducing her as his sister who is legitimately good at art might not have worked, so they go for a much bigger lie and paycheck. Greed is kicking in with head spinning intensity. Before long the family is doing things so atrocious, I started borderline hating the film. Because its protagonists are so unjustifiably vile. To be sure, I loved the parasite allegory. One gets in, starts multiplying, eventually severely damaging or destroying the host. That last part I was dreading the most. Yes, I was also dreading what will happen once the scam is discovered. But I felt really bad for the mother (Yeo-jeong Cho) who inadvertently brought the infestation into her home. She was just trying to do what any mother would - what's best for her kids. Her only fault - she wasn't too bright. Of course, I could have never anticipated the crazy plot twist that unraveled it all. But as the story rolled towards the end in a gut wrenching tangle of victims and perpetrators, the \"host\" family was treated as if their suffering were at best unimportant, at worst - funny. And they are the ones who did nothing wrong. Except for being rich - I suppose that automatically makes them villains. It was really bothering me. But that wasn't the only problem I had with the film. It didn't make sense to me how the Kims could come up with and perfectly execute an elaborate scheme, when they couldn't even assemble pizza boxes right. And if they are this smart, how is it possible that even the two young ones can't get work? Is Korean economy that bad? Another problem was that interesting things were introduced, but dropped without explanation. Like we never found out why the old housekeeper looked like she had been mugged. Or what Ki-woo was planning to do with the lucky stone. And that wonderful allegory that existed so naturally in the first half of the movie? Not completely gone in the second, but you have to look for it.",

As you can see from my rating in the picture, this is a flawless movie. I purchased it on blu-ray as soon as it became available, before even having viewed it, and I have no regrets. This is an extremely beautiful movie, and I'm not just talking about the gorgeous cinematography, editing, and visuals, but in its messages and the metaphorical intricacies within the plot as well. What a genius script and screenplay. The writing and progressions of the plot come across so seamlessly and grounded in realism. Despite this also being a fairly heavy drama, while (avoiding spoilers) also leading to some tragic events during the latter half; this is also a surprisingly comedic and hilarious film at times. As I mentioned prior, this is an immaculately shot film. I was locked in as soon as it started. Each cast member does an amazing job, it was one of those rare occasions where I completely forgot I was watching actors, but rather as if they were real people and real events transpiring. Rather than going on and on about why I loved this movie, I just highly recommend you watch it, ASAP... \n\nMy Rating - 10/10",

Parasite's commentary on class offers an interesting commentary on the lower and upper classes. What starts off as a dirty rotten scoundrels-Esque comedy quickly moves to a thriller. The idea of people going to these measures under the circumstances is simply astonishing. I was genuinely at the edge of my seat until the very end. I was legitimately terrified at certain moments, which I typically don't enjoy. However, it really worked for me. Bing Joon Ho is definitely one of the best directors working today, I'm glad that this movie is getting him the proper recognition he deserves. While it isn't my favorite movie of the year, I certainly think that it's the best. It offers the best message of any film I've seen from any movie for a long time. Everything that makes movies great all comes together for this movie. Parasite has a solid 4.9/5 from me.",

This modern classic from South Korean director Bong Joon-ho is a tragic comedy of class conflict that may be the contemporary version of Jean Renoir's masterpiece \"The Rules of the Game.\" Set in Seoul, the impoverished Kim family schemes to infiltrate themselves into the employment of the wealthy Park family household. What begins as an \"Upstairs, Downstairs\" social satire descends into tragedy as class divisions collide in unexpected ways that erupts into horrifying violence. Like Renoir, Bong Joon-ho shows a masterful command of craft with a superbly fluid, lyrical use of composition. Some of the most indelible images: the Kim children crouched next to a toilet while searching for internet reception on their cell phones; flooded sewage water that leads the Kim family to spend the night with hundreds of displaced people at a gym; the Kim family quietly hiding under a table in the Park family living room, where the husband and wife lie on the sofa nearby complaining of the Kim's odor, then making love. Unanimously selected as the winner of the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Won Oscars for Best Picture, Director, Original Screenplay, International Feature Film.

            "content": "From my blog pearsonally.com\n\nRight now, matched with India, my favorite foreign land for cinema is Korea. When it comes to dark comedic thrillers, Korean cinema in one year releases more originality than Hollywood could hope to churn out in a lustrum. And from that enchanting land, Bong Joon-ho, one of the country's most celebrated directors, has a series of incredible films under his belt, several of which I have had the pleasure of viewing.\n\nFirst, The Host (2006) was a different take on B-grade 1950s style monster movies, where sludge which is radioactive, toxic and vile, creates a creature feature wreaking havoc on Tokyo…er, Seoul. This is the biggest money-making movie in S. Korean history, and did very well for a short run here in the States. Just a few months after seeing The Host, a pal recommended to me Snowpiercer (2013), which has a ridiculous premise: all of humanity is on a train which travels around the planet, taking 1 year for each circumnavigation. My response: WTF? But my pal was right on, and Snowpiercer is brilliant; full of deep social commentary and a (rather) believable train system isolated and self-perpetuating for humanity's long haul through a frozen world. Oh, and it stars Captain America.\n\nNow Bong Joon-ho's Parasite has crawled into theaters, and instead of creating sci-fi or mild horror, he has fully immersed himself in the dark comedy and dramatic thriller themes with several horrifying moments. Without giving anything away, a stroke of luck for a young man who should have been in college turns out to be, one-by-one, a stroke of luck for his sister, father and then mother. The whole family slyly takes over the important roles — tutors, driver and cook — of a credulous family of very wealthy snobs with their single-family enclave home built by a famous architect. Yet the home has secrets, and we see that the wealthy family's beaming innocence means they pass over crazy enigmas by, for instance, not even investigating what they call faulty wiring. Since it doesn't directly effect the shallow parents, these non-normal problems in the home hide sinister slumberings beneath the modern veneer.\n\nAt just the point where I began to ask myself where this film is going, a doorbell rings, and within moments all craziness breaks out, with around 30 minutes of close calls and comedic visualizations bested only by Roman Polanski's Fearless Vampire Killers (1967). Briefly, calm returns to the cast before the corkscrew ending, a bizarre sequence of uptight calumnies, 2 murders, a newsworthy missing person story, and an adventure in the value of being a Cub Scout.\n\nBlending comedy and wound-up suspense is difficult for filmmakers to master, but Joon-ho is obviously a meticulous crafter, and the blending is balanced and feels natural. His well designed photographic sequences make for a blend of vibrancy and subtlety, each where needed. The meticulousness of the film includes the fantastic home in the movie being built from scratch, entirely designed and built just for this flick.\n\nThe day it comes to Blu-ray or streaming, I will once again be visiting Korea.  And once again I will have one of its most brilliant filmmakers as my guide.",

            "content": "A hilarious and irreverent take on South Korea's class warfare.\n\nBong Joon-ho's South Korean dark comedy Parasite (2019) may be 2019's best film with Bong's creative and innovative direction matching his and Han Jin-won's searing witty script. Bong's stylish direction gives Parasite a brisk pace and makes a 132 minute long film feel like 20 minutes. Parasite features hilarious joke after joke played with a deadpan lethargy like the horrible people acting out awful deeds just bare a nonchalant attitude about it all. I cannot overstate how refreshing Parasite is both as a genius piece of arthouse cinema, but also a very contemporary comedy of errors.\n\nBong's direction is fun and playful as he successfully subverts what the audience is expecting with outrageous twists and shocking reveals. The house escape sequence is painstakingly crafted and suspenseful like an old Hitchcock classic. Meanwhile, Bong's dry humor befits his sweeping and precise direction for the comedy scenes, like the poverty flood sequence, wherein absurdist nonsense occurs all to convey Bong's overarching metaphor of this South Korean family leeching off of an affluent and apathetic wealthy household like a parasite themselves.\n\nBong's scathing satire is entertaining in his near surreal sense of humor to his biting social commentary on South Korea's income inequality. He effortlessly juxtaposes a carefree family living in an opulent manor atop a hill within an expensive neighborhood with the poor family's destitute existence barely surviving within their messy semi-basement home at the bottom of the hill. Hong Kyung-pyo's cinematography feels like every shot was thought out beforehand with endless precision and care. Yang Jin-mo's editing is so precise and wicked as he flies the audience all around this luxury home with cunning cuts. I really like Jung Jae-il's score of beautiful harmony and dissonant disruptions.\n\nYou will want to kill the rich as your indignation for the upper classic grows with every shallow pointless move made by the lucky few, while the many impoverished characters literally fight for survival with desperate cunning and ruthless ambition only possible by living in abject poverty. Bong makes his rich into people living in light and comfort, while the poor are subservient insects that crawl around like worthless bugs. Parasite is so sublime because it can be watched for pure entertainment value of a sly poor family manipulating gullible elites into paying them for various services, but Parasite also wades in deep waters of sympathy for its poor desperate souls.\n\nI could go on about the masterful craftsmanship of Parasite, but I really want to mention the phenomenal cast of Parasite. They each play very particular roles and deliver precise and riveting performances with a memorable charm and playful deviousness. Song Kang-ho kills it as Kim \"Mr. Kim\" Ki-taek. His versatile portrayal ranges from casual relaxation, paternal care, to vicious desperation. Song is just too funny to me. His every facial expression is carefully chosen and executed like a comedic pendulum. Lee Sun-kyun is loathsome as the callous and ignorant Park \"Mr. Park\" Dong-ik. Likewise, Choi Woo-shik is hilarious in his lackadaisical leading performance as Ki-woo a.k.a. \"Kevin.\" You are endeared to him immediately, but it's his acting fascinates you with every moment and word. I must commend Chang Hyae-jin for her tough and fearsome performance as the fearless mother Chung-sook. By the same note, Lee Jung-eun is fun as the spiteful and two-faced Moon-gwang.\n\nCho Yeo-jeong is hilarious as the gullible and ignorant rich wife Yeon-kyo \"Madame\". She effortlessly plays the overly worrisome and obnoxious fake with a stunning flabbergasted face. She truly beautiful in Parasite, but it's her genuinely laugh out loud funny performance that had me constantly roaring. I adore Choi Se-yeon's stunning costumes for Cho Yeo-jeong. Similarly, Jung Ji-so is wonderful as the sweet and gentle daughter Da-hye. I must admit I completely fell in love with Ki-jung a.k.a. \"Jessica from Chicago\" played by the lovely Park So-dam. Her flawless performance in Parasite is my favorite aspect of this delightful indie film. Park is so charming, endearing, and sly as a fox with her quick-thinking, criminal chameleon.\n\nOverall, Parasite is an outstanding South Korean dark comedy that will stand up to the ages as Bong Joon-ho's immaculate direction and scorching script alone with preserve Parasite. Let alone Parasite's god tier ensemble of talented actors and actresses transforming themselves into clever charlatans and the disgustingly affluent.",

Do not read anything about it, do not watch the trailer, do not read a summary, or even this review. Go watch.\n\n*SPOILER FILLED REVIEW BELOW*\nThis should win the Oscar for the best Picture. Hands down. There is no other movie nominated that says so much, with so much depth to it's message. The cast is so impeccably acted, and The Score is John Williams-esque. It is as close to a perfect movie as I've seen since Mad Max: Fury Road, or Moonlight, or maybe Lady Bird(alright I guess I'm diminishing it, but those movies are fucking good is all I'm saying!). \n\nThis movie is a movie about income inequality plain and simple. It's pretty obvious, it doesn't try to pretend to be pretentious or im14andthisisdeep. You start off with an extremely poor family who live in what seems to be the slums of South Korea. The first act is giving you an idea of this family's dynamics, everyone's role. The cast has such incredible chemistry, not in a million years would you be able to guess  they weren't a real family if they were put in a police lineup and then were to go on about their day as everyone watched. \n\nYou would think nothing would ever break this family apart. and that's kinda the point. This family aspires desperately for a wealthier future, but given the choice between wealth and family, they would always pick the latter. Basically, the Son has a friend he grew up with who is going to study abroad. His family is wealthy enough to go to university and he wanted to give his old tutoring job to the son. \nAt first, you think, \"What a good friend. He basically gave this easy tutor job to his down on his luck childhood friend since the tutoring is for a young girl whose family is extremely well off\". \nThe friend then explains he's been tutoring this young girl for 2 years. Meaning she was in 8th grade (Junior High in the US) when he started tutoring her as he was in college. The protagonist asks why would he offer him this opportunity and not a friend from college who has the type of resume they would be looking for? \n\nIn his explanation, you begin to see a beginning to the conflicts within this film. He first seems to be thoughtful because he doesn't want to his rich fratty/douchy friends getting anywhere near this sweet, innocent young girl. He goes on to say, he wants to ask her out when he gets back from abroad, because she will be in college then. He won't have to worry about the protagonist stealing this girl from him.\n\nShowing what he truly thinks of his childhood friend, explaining how the mother is \"simple\" so you won't have to try very hard to get the job. Now this doesn't seem to be ill-guided, I don't think he meant anything by it at all. This is just the first example the movie shows of the gap between the rich and the poor. \n\nI'm not gonna explain the whole movie, but the protagonist and his family go on to con the rich family into having all of their caretaker, driver, and tutoring jobs. Unknown to the rich family that they are all related or even know each other. \n\nAny problem the rich family may encounter from the poor family or any outside conflicts, it's as simple as a phone call, request, or an extra tip to \"the help\" and their worry is gone. \n\nWhere as the poor family is at a constant battle or struggle to keep the facade up while they have the first well paying jobs in years. Any conflict or problem faced by the poor family is a level of stress that the rich family would never bother to imagine due to the privilege they have lived. \n\nAs the movie goes on, every family member in the rich family, life gets better with the help of the protagonists family. The father learns to be a better husband and father. The mother has a better relationship with her husband and children. \n\nWithout a single inkling of the con the poor family has pulled. \n\nEvery single time the poor family's lives seem to be on the up and up, something drags them back down. Something being the solution to the rich family's problem or annoyances. \n\nIn the end, it doesn't matter how nice the rich family is, how friendly, how much they tip, how much they offer. It's not a solution to problems plaguing the poor or impoverished. It's simply an out, a way to make themselves get satisfaction of being a \"good\" person. \n\nIt's like seeing a homeless person and you think it's sad or depressing. You assume they are a drunk, an addict, or a criminal, that's how they got there. *I* wasn't the reason he's there. *I* didn't do that to him. *I* gave a nice tip to the taxi driver, or the waiter, or the guy busking by the subway the other day. \n\nAnd that's the main idea here. No one wants to take the blame, and at this point, you can't blame people who aren't the richest of the rich. This stuff started A LONG time ago... but does that mean you get to sit around and do nothing about it? I mean *You* didn't put those people there, right? \n\nClimate Change wasn't *me*, that was the big oil corporations. What am I supposed to do about that? \n\nWell, maybe if that is the answer you keep getting. I think this film wants us to stop asking that same question. Maybe it's time for us to ask, \"why does it have to be this way?\". Maybe if we start asking that, then *WE* can start to under what we are supposed to do about it.",

His performance is just so raw, and it feels real. But everybody in the movie was great, I thought everybody did good. The film is incredibly written, and the film shifts well. There is a certain point where the movie goes from a well crafted satire, to a completely suspenseful thriller. The second half is where the movie began to really intrigue me, and that's saying a lot, considering the first half never bored me. Bong Joon Ho directed this movie; it was probably the best directing I have seen all year. This man is a master filmmaker, and has made some truly amazing movie over the past decade. This is his best work, and I think it's going to be very hard for him to surpass. As far as issues go, I had not one. It's an incredible movie, and everything is incredible.

Bong Joon Ho's surgical execution of shots partnered with the film's rhythm synced perfectly with the poor family's precise planning and execution of deeds to leech off the rich. And when we thought unconventional protagonists have truly won, an unbelievable twist occured, setting the film in a roller coaster like rhythm of events again. \n\n\nThe satirical portrayal of the rich left me chuckling because of exaggerated but accurate protrayal of rich people who are self-absorbed and couldn't care less about others.\n\nThe only thing I'd like for the film to fix was the build up of the driver's rage up to the stabbing part. For me I think it needed work in establishing his hatred more so the ending will be smooth. \n\nOverall I loved the film and would recommend it to others",

Of the versatile tools in that particular box, the film's at its best on the frequent occasions that it ratchets up the tension. I constantly caught myself holding in a deep breath, completely immersed in the moment and conflicted about the best possible outcome. Not all of those nail-biters lead to fireworks, and the film is careful not to overplay its hand, so that, when the time is right, those inevitable explosions land like a flurry of unexpected body blows.\n\nThe first hour is captivating, as the leeches' shady plot comes together and their long con gains momentum, but the home stretch, with its string of sharp curves and grim consequences, is unrestrained chaos in the best of ways.

I thought the plot twist would be they would grow to care for and protect the Park family, so it'd be more like mutualism than parasitism. Like those little fish that clean the shark's teeth. The brother was a scumbag. He was entrusted the HS girl by his buddy who gave him the rock gift and introduced the job opportunity to him. Not to mention he intended to murder the other family with the rock. The father's whole philosophy about having no plan being the infallible plan I disagree with, that's just an excuse for being impulsive and lazy, which is what they are- complete losers. In fact all of the philosophy of that movie I disagree with- that poverty is an excuse for moral depravity. Morality is absolute, not situational and not relative. I got the deeper philosophical point of the movie, I just disagree. The crazy basement guy had motive other than being crazy. And the father had even less logical reason to go berserk. Sure maybe he was upset that his daughter was hurt and Mr. Park only cared about his family and his son, but if his main concern was his daughter he would've grabbed the keys and the daughter and driven her off- not tossed the keys and stabbed the guy and made things worse. It just seemed like gratuitous violence for the sake of empty shock value. The ending was somewhat okay- there was a redemption of values when the son said his approach was to work hard earn money and buy the house so the father can be free- and the father in the meantime lives a life in \"jail\" indefinitely.",

The problem is not that the movie is in Korean with English subtitles, it’s not the acting, it’s not the cinematography, it’s not the wardrobe... those are all fine, well and good. It’s the perverted, dark and twisted u-turn the movie takes half way through that leaves you hopeless in mankind. So..... - If you are single and take a date to this movie, it will be your last date. - If you take your 18 year old daughter, you will never live it down and for years to come you are fore-fitting any rights to decide what to watch. - If you take your spouse, you are telling them that they are dumb as a box of rocks or that they are likely to be killed by an indigent. - If you take your parent, you are telling them that anything wrong in your life is their fault. - If you go by your self, have puppies or kittens waiting for you at home to show you love and raise your spirits.

            "content": "As a teenager, I have been infatuated with cinematography and films since I was young. My father, who was practically an amateur critic, would showcase and present me his favorite feature films that he had progressed and expanded in his life of several decades. He rates movies and declares on watching them in a conceited method. Using movie ratings, any movie that seems to have approached over 80% on Rotten Tomatoes, he would give it a watch. Any movie over 90%, he would definitely watch. Any movie under any of those ratings, he believes it as waste of time. With this unhealthy mentality being exposed to me ever since I was a kid, my criticism for films has come to become overwhelmingly harsh. My ratings for films would be far lower than the average viewer that I conversed/interacted/viewed. I would dock points and be disappointed for a film if I had noticed a flaw of any kind, small or big. For almost 18 years, I have watched films. And I have begun to think that I had the special mind of a \"critic\" where it was far more challenging to impress me in any aspect compared to the average viewer. Sure, this mentality may cause many people to think that I was simply a picky, foolish teenager that was far too cocky with their tastes. I have recognized this. But it was reasonable to a certain extent. I tend to think about films as they progress and surprisingly, 100% of all films I have watched, I would always be left slightly or far disappointed because I was able to predict/expect how the film was to reach its peak or how it was to end. A clear example is the film Knives Out. A mystery film released in late 2019, it has received spectacular reviews. Many say that it was one of the best films they have watched in their life. I had the chance to watch it the past week with high expectations. My experience was a complete contrast to that of the reviews. Unfortunately, I was practically able to depict how the film was going to resolve, who the \"perpetrator\" was, and so on much before its climax. Maybe if I had watched the film without analyzing every shot, I would have enjoyed the film. But this is who I am. I do this and that is how I watch films. Of course, the film industry has evolved into a market that is pervaded with halfwitted big-budget CGI films for viewers with quite simple mindsets of having an effortless fun experience at the movies with friends or family, which I cannot stress, is perfectly fine. But for viewers such as me, who love to analyze films and watch them like it if it was a form of art, the modern generation of filmography has become far bland, with most being - ahem* excuse me - shit. From big-budget, low effort Chinese funded films to \"popular\" trendy \"superhero\" films, the market has evolved into something that was not a delightful experience for me. This directly connects to my initial mentality. I have watched many many classics ranging from a multitude of genres. With a father with a strict process of watching and rating films, I have fetched a similar mentality, possibly far more stern and harsh than one of my father's. But because our generation of films has degraded in quality, in the artistic aspect anyway, it is rare for me to have given a film that is over a 9/10 on my rating scale. In fact, I have practically accepted that a movie that was so perfect to have received a 10/10 on \"my\" scale would be virtually infeasible. In the hundreds of reviews I have written for films, there was some sort of negative nitpicking that had left me unsatisfied \"perfectly\". This, as a result, has left me to accept that I could never be fully 100% satisfied with any film in the upcoming future or in the near past.\n\nBut today, everything has changed. A few hours ago, I was able to receive the opportunity to watch the film Parasite directed and written by Bong Joon-Ho. I have watched many of Bong's films from the classic The Host - which I can confidently recommend to many people - to Okja, his most recent film, linked and partnered with Netflix. After watching Okja, I was left immensely disappointed and I am quite guilty to say that I had lost all respect for Bong's spectacular storytelling and cinematography. But after watching Parasite today, I could accept that is by the far the best film I have watched in my life and I have gained this newfound respect, far massive than something I had before.\n\nI went inside the theaters with exceedingly high expectations and as it began, I formed many scenarios of how it was to resolve and thinking of how I could match this film to a genre. Not once in my life, even after watching hundreds of classics that so-called \"revolutionized\" the film industry, have I became so immersed with the film to have been left disappointed that the film had ended. It was almost as if I was able to finally \"feel\" the great emotion of being amazed by a film, so much that it would leave me with \"no words\". As the film caught on, I completely forgot about my habit of \"analyzing\" due to the immense immersion I was in and for the first time, I was able to have the reaction to that of the average viewer. I believe that the Parasite is far superior to any classic film that people believe that revolutionized Hollywood. Many resort to saying that Hitchcock was the ultimate film director, completely revolutionizing cinematography using his new-wide skills of contemporary film shots and robust scenarios. But what Bong did was something much more than that. In a generation where everything has been discovered and finding a new creative method to film something is unrealistic, that is what Bong has done with Parasite. What Bong did was that rather than creating a simple \"good\" film with fine acting and fine screenplay writing and fine cinematography, he has invented a new genre of films. He has truly revolutionized the modern film industry, something that I believed was simply irrational to even consider. Parasite has defeated me. I could not predict it not once. I could not even consider how it was to go on. The only question I had the entire film was \"Okay, what the hell is next? Where is this going? How the fuck can you even end this?\". But in fact, he did end it. And it was not a disappointing one. It left me with an open mouth. No words. I would sit through the entire credits without saying or moving. I was just thinking to myself \"Holy fucking shit.\". On the drive home, I was thinking \"Holy fucking shit.\". For many hours at home after, I was thinking \"Holy fucking shit.\".\n\nI did have one disappointing thought about the film. And it was not about the film at all. As a Korean-American, who is very very familiar with Korean culture and being able to fluently speak it as well, I was able to watch it with ease without translations. Parasite is a Korean film. And because it was a Korean film, it was a film derived from Korean culture. As I watched the film, I could only be left disappointed that for some scenarios, the translations strayed away from its original meaning. But I cannot complain, some parts of Korean culture and language are just not possible to translate on paper perfectly for American viewers. That is my disappointment. I am sad that American viewers, who do not understand the Korean language or culture, cannot spectate the film as I have, who fully understood the hints that only one of a Korean viewer could catch. (As a side note for American viewers who were unfamiliar with Korean language or culture and you happen to learn or become familiar with Korean culture or language, I highly recommend that you watch it once more, it just makes the film so much better and polished.)\n\nRegarding the film, I could write pages and pages about my internal thoughts about the film. In fact, I am confident that I could write an entire book regards to my reaction and thoughts about the film. But it is pointless. When you attempt to explain this film to another, you cannot. The only way to know is to have watched it yourself. I cannot review this film. I cannot explain this film simply as a viewer. I cannot talk about how \"good\" the plot was or how \"good\" the screenplay was. It was none of those things. It was just….how would I say it…..a film made by Bong and only Bong. My final thought? The only thing I can say is to fucking watch it.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nRating: 10/10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: I have noticed that it has been nominated for Oscar's best picture as well. I have watched every nominee film (except for Little Women which I will hopefully be able to watch before the Oscar's). Any other film, in comparison to the Parasite is complete child's play. It is like comparing a film made by a high school freshman to that of a professional. While I am aware that the chances of a foreign film winning an Oscar Best Picture are very slim, I hope it holds out as I believe that the traction it may cause may once again inspire the film market to create new contemporary films so that I can once again, possibly rate another film a 10/10 in the future. Parasite has given me hope that film can evolve once more. I am selfish. And once could perceive me as cocky and a brainless immature teenager. But I could not give one fuck. Just fucking watching the film.",

Expone la miseria humana y los defectos de un modelo socioeconómico de una forma muy cruda, directa y lo que hace que eso sea más contundente es que se desarrolla en un país que se considera de éxito económico, un país \"desarrollado\".\nUno logra imaginarse estar en la piel de los personajes, porque te muestran su intimidad de familia y sus desagracias.\nLas actuaciones: todas excelentes. Debo decir que mi personaje preferido es el papá, que explota al final, incapaz de seguir aceptando la humillación cede a su lado más oscuro y se quiebra, revienta.\nEs, además, una denuncia potente al mundo.",

It seems that at the same time as the characters of the film took other people's social places, the same happened with the screenwriter: someone slammed him and tried to finish what was started. The first 20 minutes were really good, there was subtlety, surprise, interest. The final might not have been bad, but it didn't. But what happened from 21 minutes to the final credits was clearly done by a stupid layman who hastily wanted to cut down easy money: there is no plot, there is no development, there is no idea, at least there is no sense either. There is bad humor, prolonged inappropriate vulgarity and stupid performance. This part is a parasite of the first 20 minutes. It is stupid, meaningless, not funny, not sad, not professional, does not give reason to think about anything, and leaves nothing in the soul. A complete zero. 1.5 hour part of the stupid action just takes screen time. It is all far-fetched and lumped together with the ending invented by the real (killed earlier) screenwriter.\nSpoilers: Four antipodes hide under the table while the rich unsuspecting owners try to have sex in the same living room (the camera focuses the viewer's attention on the erogenous zones of men and women, probably so that the audience does not forget where someone has what button, there is no spiritual background, there is no need to stretch this scene), several times incomprehensible additional characters roll down the stairs (a three-time reference to Hitchcock, aliluya!), what else was there? Oh, Yes, the storm-sewer flow, as the reality of the lower \"basement\" social society, returned the heroes from heaven to earth! That's all, nothing else.\nTo give this nonsense at least some meaning, the parasites of the film business called the resulting film a \"Social satire\".\nIf the point is hidden precisely in making fun of the audience, showing that parasites are not only heroes, but also the script, then you can probably appreciate this work: the Cannes Palme d'or, five Oscar nominations. While it may be the purpose of high honors is to support the development koreyskogo cinema. But I have not yet grown up to this: I would not award and nominate for something that is not there, for something that is stolen, or for something that could have been but did not happen.\nIn principle, it is clear why the Director begged the press not to disclose the turning (from 21 minutes) plot, and why there is not a single frame from the second part in the trailer: the trailer is also the work of the first (substituted later) screenwriter - when he did his work, the second part was not yet at all.\nOnly stupid empty first commercial post-Soviet films of the 90's come to mind for comparison. Or empty stupid post-Soviet TV series a 2000s. We don't blame Anyone, then they just had to earn money.\nIn principle, the film could have been cool if the screenwriter had not been replaced after the first 20 minutes...",

Parasite has a mild overarching story, and no character growth (reportedly a mark of the writer's). Actors rival any community cast, providing good caricature renderings.

Little did I expect Cannes Film Festival to award the prestigious Palme D'or this year to a director who has been one of my least favorite filmmakers...until now. Bong Joon-ho's English film debut, 2013's SNOWPIERCER, struck me as overrated and dumb while 2017's OKJA was cartoonish and ham-fisted. It didn't help that he'd relegated two of my favorite actors, Tilda Swinton and Jake Gyllenhaal, to cringe-inducing career-low sideshow performers. Besides that, I just couldn't vibe with his grotesque and bumbling concoction of family-friendly cuteness, ultra violence, and quirky humor. It reeked of trying too hard and failed to land with me at every turn. With that said, let me be the first and most surprised person to say with no reservations PARASITE is easily one of the best movies I've seen this year.\n\nHowever, there's the other genetically engineered super pig in the room: PARASITE has an awful lot in common with last year's Palme D'or winner SHOPLIFTERS. Putting aside that the former is a Korean production and the latter was Japanese, both films follow the lives of a poor family as they struggle on the fringes of society, running cons and scams to get by in a callous world. They are held together by their honest love for one another, and their example is set juxtaposed to the neglectfulness of a consumerist society that allows so many to fall through the cracks in the first place.\n\nBut the main way that Joon-ho one-up's his award-winning predecessor is with an incisive sense of humor suffused in each character, a humor that is immediately, physically translatable despite the language barrier. It works here so well precisely because it's reigned in and understated throughout the film, making the more manic parts hit harder - such as when Park So-Dam apathetically lights a cigarette on a lidded toilet spewing flooded sewage out the sides. The class conscious themes that have pervaded Joon-ho's science fiction offerings up to this point are given a much greater sense of immediacy and relatability as we watch this struggling family elbow their way into the good graces of a rich, privileged, and naive family. Beside the obvious \"haves vs. have-nots\" one would expect from this scenario, there's clearly an exploration of the structures that relegate people into servitude and poverty for generations, not just by the wealthy elite but by the pervasive mechanisms of misfortune that are maintained by the working class as we claw at each other's throats for short-term gain.\n\nBelieve the hype, PARASITE is well deserving of the praise it has received thus far. It's tense, hilarious, and poignant, and I'm forced to genuinely re-evaluate this director's output knowing that he knocked it out of the park this time.",

The settings are interesting to say the least. The film unfolds somewhat like \"Shoplifters\"--impoverished but clever people who are holding the short end of the stick under our world-wide inequitable economic and social systems. The families in both films scrape by through guile while existing in a semi-underground setting (literally--their living quarters are below street level--and socially, they are disconnected from the fruits of bourgeois society, with no apparent prospects of climbing the ladder). \"Parasite\" begins well enough but soon drifts into an atmosphere of tension fostered by the creepy machinations of the family members--who seem to have no compunction in betraying the family friend who provides the reference affording them access to the wealthy household. The marks in their con game seem like decent enough folk given their typical (for their class) obliviousness to the inequities in the socioeconomic system that has rewarded them with luxury while forcing the less fortunate to grub out whatever existence they can manage. The film establishes no real basis for the destitute family's turn to enmity, or for that matter to abject stupidity with a beggars banquet farce that sets off the cataclysmic climax. The revelation of the safe room/fall-out shelter with its demented underground occupant may constitute a plausible metaphor for a number of things, including a rage that could rightfully simmer in the consciousness of exploited and repressed humanity. The cowboy and Indian farce no doubt has its own intended symbolic import. But the homicidal melee that concludes the film's action unfortunately reflects a deficit of imagination, at the same time suggesting the filmmakers' possible contempt for an audience that has been drawn in with a plot that early on masquerades as social comedy. The characters devolve into stick-figures in what amounts to little more than a nihilistic allegory.",

Este es un filme que se toma el tiempo de introducir a cada uno de los personajes que componen a la familia que lo protagoniza, así como de desarrollar las características propias de cada uno de ellos, y eventualmente reunirlos en una trama con twists sorpresivos y un clímax extrañamente apropiado. Como crítica social, Parasite logra presentar claros contrastes y similitudes entre clases sociales, al mismo tiempo que no se apena de señalar los males que caracterizan a cada uno de los lados. El guion, los diálogos y la dirección de Bong Joon-ho son tan elocuentes como satisfactorios. Empaquetada dentro de una comedia bastante oscura, esta película es excelente en tantos niveles que, en mi opinión, merece 4 sólidas estrellas de 5 y la oportunidad de verla en salas de cine (así como el cuidado de no observar el poster oficial surcoreano que muestra el clímax de la película y sus consecuencias).",

            "content": "Lo primero que vemos en Parasite es la ventana de un sótano que da a ras de suelo de una calle iluminada por el sol. Y nos quedamos con esta imagen hasta que se da el primer movimiento de cámara del filme, cuando ésta desciende y, sentado en el suelo del sótano, vemos a uno de los protagonistas de esta última producción de  de Bong Joon-ho. Solo con eso, el director y el cinematógrafo han establecido el tema principal de la película, que será desarrollado a lo largo de 132 minutos: el lugar que ocupan los pobres y los marginados. \n\nBong Joon-ho es un cineasta muy sencillo. Sus películas cuentan historias complejas, de profundo contenido social, pero siempre utilizando los recursos cinematográficos más básicos para reforzarlos. Sus películas son, para el ojo entrenado, lo que una sinfonía de Bethoveen es para un oído entrenado: sublimes. \n\nY lo mejor de todo es que no necesitas años de entrenamiento tipo conservatorio para apreciar lo sublime en los filmes de Joon-ho. Solo necesitas mirar con atención.\n\nTodo está en los ángulos y los movimientos de cámara. Es con ellos que Bong Joon-ho deletrea los aspectos más importantes de su trama, mientras el guion y las actuaciones se encargan de desarrollarla. Para eso el director coreano se vale de un control absoluto de lo que muestra, cómo lo muestra y a qué ritmo lo muestra. \n\nHay que pensar en sus películas como coreografías entre el elenco y la cámara, llenas de escenas en las que cada movimiento importa porque todo relata o refuerza algo. \n\nPor eso Joon-ho nunca se complica demasiado con su cinematografía –aunque sí con los objetos, la profundidad y los colores de su diseño de escenarios–, y más bien mantiene sus ángulos y movimientos de cámara dentro de lo básico y consistente. De esta forma, una vez que entramos en ritmo, podemos bailar con su filme, tal como el elenco está danzando con la cámara.\n\nY eso nunca fue más cierto que en Parasite (2019), donde Bong Joon-ho refina su habilidad de ser leve en el caos y oscuro en la levedad. Como dije ya, la película comienza con un movimiento de cámara que nos introduce a la pobreza de un hogar de gente que tiene que hacer de todo para conseguir dinero y sobrevivir. \n\nA lo largo del filme los veremos abajo, intentando ascender y lográndolo a medida que la película es una divertida y perversa comedia en la que esta familia pobre se infiltra como la servidumbre de un lujoso hogar de gente adinerada. \n\nEs tan básico y consistente el lenguaje visual de Joon-ho que a esta familia adinerada la muestra siempre arriba: ubica su hogar en las colinas, los separa de su servidumbre por líneas naturales del escenario, los pone en espacios iluminados y abiertos para remarcar la claustrofobia en la que viven los otros, los marginados.\n\nParasite es un filme que está en constante diálogo consigo mismo. Cada acto, cada escena, tienen una consecuencia a lo largo de una película cuyo giro pareciera cambiarla por completo. \n\nBong Joon-ho es un maestro del tono, puede hacerte reír en un momento oscuro y despertar un miedo dentro de ti en el momento más ridículo. Pero en Parasite esto es más intenso. De una comedia perversa pasamos a un caos contundente, a algo tan extraño y tan violento que seguramente es cierto. Y en realidad es un giro de trama que no hace más que reforzar el tema principal: el lugar de la pobreza en la sociedad, cómo funciona la división de clases o, en palabras del mismo Joon-ho, cómo en una sociedad capitalista la unión solo es posible en cómo una clase utiliza a la otra. \n\n¡Y el elenco! Cada actor y actriz encarnan a sus personajes de una manera tan efectiva, que no dudamos de ellos ni cuando la historia da su giro. Joon-ho ha trabajo con grandes como Tilda Swimton, Jake Gyllenhall, Ed Harris, Chris Evans y los resultados son increíbles, pero habla muy bien de él que pueda hacer lo mismo y hasta tal vez más con un elenco de su Corea del Sur natal –entre ellos su actor mimado Song Kang-ho– desconocidos para una gran mayoría. \n\nPara cuando llega el final de la película –ese final delirante que nos deletrea la imposibilidad de ascender que tienen la clase baja y hasta la clase media–, el elenco ha hecho tan buen trabajo que ese último golpe de la trama a los personajes, es también un golpe a nosotros, a nuestras propias fantasías económicas, es un llamado a mirar de nuevo como dividimos las clases en nuestras sociedades.\n\nEn resumen: Después de películas tan excelentes como Memories of murder (2003), The host (2006), Mother (2009), Snowpiercer (2013) y Okja (2017), Joon-ho creó un filme tan genial que no tiene nada que envidiarle a sus antecesores. En él se nota a un Bong Joon-ho con mayor maestría de su arte, que no tiene problemas para captar tu atención y encima se da el lujo de hacer una película que es más de lo que parece, donde todo está tan naturalmente desarrollado que uno simplemente fluye con la intensidad de su trama y su significativo peso que tendremos que cargar mucho después de los créditos finales. \n\nSee you space, cowboy!",

            "content": "The poor are most commonly shown rising to a higher socioeconomic class in films through becoming gun toting gangsters or being so nice and optimistic that some rich person takes pit on them. In this offbeat film our out of work, lower class protagonists do commit crimes by fraudulently claiming to have credentials that they do not possess but present themselves as tutors and cooks not drug dealers or pimps. We are inclined to be sympathetic to these people who are terribly disadvantaged and struggle to make a living but they are conniving and cruel to those lower than them when given the slightest taste of power. This forces us to consider whether to take on some rather indefensible moral positions or realize that there are few moral absolutes when it comes to matters of class warfare.\n\nThe Kim family live in one tiny house together in a neighborhood full of other unemployed people who are looked down upon by the nearby upper class. Their lives change when their intelligent son Ki-Woo, Choi Woo-Shik, is offered a job by his friend as a tutor for a member of the Park family, the wealthy Da-hye, Jeong Ji-so, who is the daughter of entrepreneur Dong-ik, Lee Sun-kyun. He has his crafty sister Ki-jeong, Park So-dam, create a fake university diploma for him and takes up the job after fooling her gullible mother Yeon-gyo, Cho Yeo-jyong. Soon the family decides that they will have to remove the existing employees of the Parks so that they can obtain jobs. They lie to them and claim that they are not related but when they remove longtime housekeeper Moon-gwang, Lee Jung-eun, she returns to help her husband Geun-sae, Park Myung-hoon, who has been secretly hiding in a bunker under the house for years. This causes conflict between the two families and when a party is held tensions erupt between the three different groups.\n\nThe title of the film was deceptive in a way as I expected this film to be a traditional horror in which an animal takes hold of the bodies of several people and tries to take over the world but the film was far from that. Yet the title still fits as without knowing it the Parks and their mansion is slowly infected by this lower class family who may seem benevolent and unassuming but present a real threat when left to their own devices. The somewhat dim Yeon-gyo is a product of her upbringing as we assume she has always been a member of the idle rich and has never been forced to claw her way up the food chain in order to gain wealth or security. Ki-Woo's mother Chung-sook, Chang Hyae-jin, is exactly the opposite as she has been forced to scrounge for whatever money she can get and actively pressures those around her to provide for her. This desperation may not be becoming but if we are honest it is what most poor people who were able to become wealthy by some miracle probably had. One must be ruthless in most situations to come out on top and when we meet Chung-sook and her family they have already experienced so much horror than they are completely cynical.\n\nThese qualities make it hard for us to like them as while Yeon-gyo is rich and an airhead she does not appear to take advantage of anybody and her ignorance is perhaps her worst trait. It is when the poor family find themselves with a measure of wealth and power when the Parks vacate their home for a few days that their true colors come out. With the return of Moon-gwang and the discovery of her husband in the bunker Chung-sook is given the option of either helping somebody in need of a break or handing her over to the police so that she and her family can enjoy the luxuries of the house alone. She takes the first option and is cruel to the former housekeeper even when she begs on her knees for some mercy. Then the tables are turned and there is a delicious moment in which the begging Moon-gwang gains the upper hand and her entire demeanor changes. These shifts in power occur throughout the film and allow us to consider what power does to people as they seem to lose their empathy when they gain it.\n\nThere are points where the film drags a little bit and I do not know if I would have made the epilogue quite so lengthy but the film is fascinating to dissect and deserves to be one of the most discussed of the year.",

Rich people, in that sense, are indeed a bit more \"naive\" because they do not know how it feels to not even have the basic needs met; but it's also this deeply engrained difference, that made this minor overheard comment of the smell lead to the death of Mr Park (because that implies, that the Kim family never has a chance of really being part of the upper class). And Mr Kim being the second parasite, makes people wonder what was the story behind the first parasite, was there also a tragic story behind; also the ending, family reunion in the sunshine, seemed almost real, and it might happen, but still - it's so long.

One could say, that's life, but I didn't buy it. It ventures into Tarantino territory, but his characters are so well defined that you're ready for the bloodbath whether the heroes live or die.

Movies with such unlikable caricatures can work when the plot is wildly entertaining via original humor, thrills or a big reveal to illustrate social injustice. Unfortunately, Parasite only pantomimes the mayhem of a Guy Ritchie caper and the gore of a Tarantino flick. What is supposed to be suspenseful or funny is unoriginal or just plain nonsensical, and because you don't care about the characters, the overall experience is a hollow, unappealing slog with tons of bodily-function/gross out jokes to boot.",

It becomes particularly interesting as the movie reveals literally another level that sees no daylight at all. The movie has many layers, including one of being a basic thriller.  Yep, that's blood. Kang-ho Song is particularly effective as the Kim family patriarch.  All this said, I am not sure how much I emotionally resonated with the Kim family or Mr. Kim in particular.

In the beginning of the movie.... (spoiler alert -- you have been warned) the poor family was in great desperation for survival. Anyone in this survival mode usually become very creative in problem-solving, focused, calm, disciplined, and motivational. The poor family with this adaptive mindset taught themselves everything they need in order to survive. They successfully did this. However, they went a little to the extreme, which is not realistic in real life. Again, this is a movie, so we need to see an extreme example. Otherwise, this movie won't be worth watching. The poor family took an extreme approach and achieved a great success. However, in life, easy comes easy goes, and this literally happened. What happened next is literally a moral conflict between two poor families trying to survive. In stead of co-operation, which, in reality, most people do. These poor people chose a path to win-lose situation. Again, this is a movie, in real life, most people would come up with win-win solution, but this wouldn't make a great movie. As a result, the two families clashed into a win-lose... I mean... lose-lose situation. Devastation for not only the two poor families but the hosts also. The biggest takeaway is that people in desperation are very creative and will do whatever it takes because they are in survival mode.",

Parasite has elements of sidesplitting comedy, seat-clenching thriller, riveting drama and more. And they all have their time in the sun thanks to the spectacular juggling act by Bong Joon Ho. The filmmaker is so present in every scene- nay, in every shot. All of the film's technical elements meshed together in one of the most well-oiled machines I have ever seen on screen. I'll break down some of these in detail, but it bears repeating that Bong displays master craftsmanship in this textbook definition of a passion project.\n\nThe foundation of every film is its screenplay, and this one by Bong and Han Jin Won is exceptional. Aside from the aforementioned genre blending, this script tackles ever present themes of class warfare, social mobility, greed, manipulation, and power, to name a few. The icing on this cake is the highly witty and clever dialogue, which expertly delivers humor and theme at the same time. \n\nThe ensemble cast deserves far more recognition and praise than it is currently receiving. There was truly not one weak link. Every actor had shining moments where they displayed a layered, highly developed character. The standout is clearly Song Kang-ho, playing the father of the Kim family (arguably the protagonist). He displays the most vivid and defined character arc throughout the cast. A personal favorite of mine has to be Park So-dam, who played Ki-jung (Jessica) also of the Kim family. Her scenes earned well deserved laughter from the audience in my theater; the way she repeatedly bowls over Mrs Park is hilarious and memorable.\n\nOf all the masterful technical elements, the one that is most deserving of praise is the production design by Lee Ha-jun. The sets were so crucial to the storytelling and themes, and the detail that went into them provided so much. It bears mentioning that both the dirty alleyway of the Kim's home and the gorgeous home of the Parks were both built *entirely* from scratch. These two locations provided great insight into the circumstances of the two families, and the contrast between the two was thematically brilliant. The Park home in particular was superb; the cinematography (Hong Gyeong-pyo) completely immersed the audience in an intimate way. Alongside the design is the excellence of the editing. Mark my words- the montage where the Kims are plotting against the Parks' maid will be in film school masterclasses for decades to come. Finally, the music by Jung Jae-il greatly assisted in the film's constant shifting between moods and tones. \n\nThe one qualm I have with this film is that the rewatchability is somewhat low. But this is acceptable, given that the first time watch value is so incredibly high. Parasite is a technical marvel as well as a downright entertaining roller coaster. If you see only one film this awards season, make it Parasite.\n\n10/10.",

Just when I was about to slit my own wrist from boredom, I was so thankful of the non-sensical. bizarre, abrupt ending came.  It was if the writers couldn't find a way to end the boredom and one of them yelled out \"just kill everyone\".  This is a great movie for those who liked Last Blood, Terminator 56, and other garbage now showing in a theater near you.  Morse code?  Really?  You get rid of your entire staff in the snap of a finger?  Secret bunkers the home owner doesn't know about?  Flooding from a rain storm that displaces thousands in a city like Seoul?\n\nAs one of the characters says, in what seemed to have been 13 hours into the movie; \"we have no plan\".  Sums up this movie.\n\nThe movie and reviews just don't match-up.  It's like watching \"I like to sing\" and seeing someone with no voice and no talent winning win - all the time you're saying \"her husband had to have sponsored the show with some large amount of money\"\n\nSouth Korea is known for manipulating the system (remember the Chinese girl who got plastic surgery and the doctor accidentally killed her and the hospital hired the PR firm to wipe the internet of the negative publicity?). This is no different - this movie sucked.  \n\nIt's not even close to Old Boy - this is just another scam PoS movie from the ROK that is more PR than film.

A tale of finding work to support your family soon becomes something entirely more bleak and sinister than the premise would suggest, and the longer the films goes on the more disturbing things become. Bong Joon Ho is a director with an eye for the unique and usual, and he holds nothing back here. I love how different it is, I love how well its acted, how deceptively clever the seemingly simple script is, and I love how it constantly feels like its building to something. Many of the moments take you by complete surprise, and some scene had me on the edge of my seat with my breath firmly caught in my throat. It fits into a lot of genres, such as family drama, satire, horror, slasher, but what it is above all else is a social critique. Is a commentary on the mixing of social classes, on the governments abuse of the proletariats, on the shifting dynamics of a family in poverty? It could be all of them, or it could be none of them. The film is very much open to interpretation, but I definitely see is as an allegory for the divide between the affluent and the poor, and how rarely the opposing ends of the social spectrum can be united. Whatever message you glean from it, there's no doubting that the film is yet another remarkable movie that the Writer/Director can add to his already stellar resume.

A gripping story that makes the strong distinction of social classes an exaggerated conflict and that never allows the viewer to guess what is going to happen next.

While it appears satirical, those of us with experience as part of the working class know all to well the things we would do to support our families.

This film is undoubtedly the best movie I've watched in 2019.\n\nIt's a genre-defying film—it makes you laugh hysterically in one scene to crying with a whirlpool of emotion in another. It's a rollercoaster ride with incredible screenplay and directing. Additionally, the score makes the film even more exhilarating and you're intensely gripped with what is happening from one scene to the next that you cannot turn away. Perhaps it is for this reason I have watched this film four times, and each time I find myself laughing, tensed up, shocked, sobbing in the same scenes. The magic of this film never dies away. If anything, rewatching it showcases smart details that Director Bong has included that may have gone unnoticed before. \n\nFrom the cast to the score to the director, the film is incredible. Song Kang Ho showcases such genuine emotion that you forget that this is a fictional script. All actors and actresses fervently commit to their roles and you see them as genuinely human. There are no villains here, which is why it makes the film so captivating. You don't know who you are rooting for or who you should be rooting for. The set of the movie is also noteworthy—they created the poor neighborhood and the rich house from scratch!\n\nWhile this movie is in Korean, the movie explores a theme centered around class-struggle that is universal. The movie is centered around a rich family and a poor family, and how their lives eventually intertwine. You get to understand their family dynamics, economy, and their hopes (and also hopelessness). Even if you're not Korean, you will connect to this film. It's a film about people and socioeconomic classes, among other things.\n\nYou'll do yourself a disservice if you don't watch this movie! It's an incredible experience, and I can not recommend it enough. There is a reason why this movie is gaining worldwide success and award recognition. And it deserves all the attention it is getting. Director Bong has produced many of the best cinematic experiences in Korea. This one is an extraordinary one.",

The direction of Bong Joon-Ho is very simple, ensuring the viewer a very comfortable experience. The script is intriguing and curious, can keep the viewer completely glazed in the story. These are very good performances by Koreans, which show true performances. The movie ends up getting a little lost in the final act, but nothing that spoils the experience. It is very worth it. Parasite is a great movie.",

Every twist and turn is unexpected and the execution of the film is perfect.\n\nNo other word I can use to describe this film: perfect.\n\nEvery character in this film is ones that viewers can emphasize with. The themes of class conflict (also seen in Boon-ho's Snowpiercer) prevails in this film as well. It's stunning to see these dynamics play out.\n\nIn parts where you expect to know how the story will turn out, another curveball is thrown that catches the viewer off-guard.

All the characters have personal motivations and flaws that make you root for and against them, often at once.  Plus, Ho manages to deliver some of the funniest moments in cinema in recent years, especially in the way the family cons their way into upper class life.

I finally saw a movie I had been yearning for some time. I am a little late to the party, in regards to my timing of this film. But I am ecstatic I got to view it in a theatre. I wanted to go in with no expectations, because typically I am let down. I have a tendency nitpick as a viewer, which can make some movies difficult to enjoy. I was aware that it had won best foreign film at the Golden Globes, and had received much critical acclaim. I cannot recall seeing another Bong Joon Ho film, except possibly The Host (in which case, it was so long ago- I do not remember). Either way, I was excited to see a movie that looked like a family drama, with perhaps some suspenseful elements.  \n\n\tAs I sat in this small cleanly theatre, I noticed the majority of people were of Asian descent, and unless my eyes betrayed me, mostly Korean. I attend movies frequently and it was nice to see a very diverse crowd. As the lights dimmed and people munched on their popcorn, and drank their coke's; I sat there, by myself- as the only one in my row. Ready to have a fun experience, with what's been regarded as one of the best of the year.\n\n\tThe first portion of the movie, centers around an engaging Korean family who live in a lower-class part of the city looking for jobs. They live in a home that is underground, but can still see the street through one of the windows. The family consists of a young adolescent brother and sister as well as their middle-aged parents. The movie begins with raucous laughs and instantly makes you engaged with these characters. The first 30 mins is truly a full-blown comedy and my theatre could not stop laughing. In its own right it is a very effective comedy, that had hints of possible dread ahead. The hints at suspense begin when another family is brought into the story. We see how both of these families become entangled in each other's lives, and how the threads are tied together. The pace was slower in the early stages, but still immensely entertaining. Then there is a tonal flip. A character re-enters the story and you instantly feel tight. At this point you could not really tell where the story was headed, so I stayed in peak curiosity. Then comes a moment when dread absolutely swept over me and I felt as if the story was about to turn into a full-blown horror movie. I sat there in near dread, caught in my own amazement of what I was watching. The tension then softened a bit, but there was still an underlay of tightness. The whole tone of the movie had changed by this point, and you can feel the stress the characters are going through. As well as the fact that the viewer knows more than some of the characters on screen, so there are moments when you want to shout at the screen- DON'T LOOK THERE! Within a few minutes though, you are immersed in the new direction the story has gone in and what's happening. It was fun to follow the story's new direction, with a good level of suspense at this point. You can feel everything is on the brink of destruction, but its still being held together by a thread. Then the story levels off a little bit, heading an even different direction. In this sequence the story is setting up a finale, that will leave devastation. Once we get started in the third act, my jaw just about hit the floor and I was stunned. The final 20 minutes of this people was honestly breathtaking. The music, visuals, acting and the tone of the story hits you like a ton of bricks. By the time the final credits rolled, I sat there in utter amazement. It was the first time I left a theatre feeling utter euphoria. I was absolutely ecstatic with what I had just seen. \n\nParasite is a film that brings together a plethora of genres that all coalesce effectively. There is an underlying theme of classism and how the social construct of class impacts the psyche of the characters. But this is truly a story that has many layers, and the shifting tones create an atmosphere that is both eerily terrifying as well as holistically captivating.\n\nGrade- A+  \n\nBrody's TAKE 5",

And then 2019 came in with an abundance of original films from some of the greatest and creative minds in the industry, Baumbach, Tarantino, Scorsese to name a few. But Parasite stood out from the bunch. Bong Joon Ho has made a modern masterpiece. Without getting into spoiler the movie made me laugh, cringe, it made me uncomfortable at some points, I felt tense from start to finish. But the best thing about this movie is that it’s unpredictable and when you watch the whole film to the end you feel a weight has been lifted. By far one of the best films of the decade, definitely one or the best film of the year. I will recommend this film to anyone who is in need of powerful, original storytelling, with master class directing. Thank you Mr. Joon Ho, you gave me inspiration and hope in cinema. ",

The portrayal of the families in Parasite felt remarkably authentic and there were reasons to sympathize with both sides. The acting in the movie was great all around but I was particularly impressed by Kang-Ho Song and Park So-dam who gave the performances of their careers.

Equally appalling is the gushing of critics over it - \"urgent social commentary.\" Perhaps there's a parallel to the emperor's new clothes - the tailor says that only a fool can't see them, so nobody wants to admit the obvious - the king is naked. In this case, the \"auteur\" is naked and the critics are the fools. The pity is that it could have been a fine movie, if its creator hadn't decided to go for cheap shock value.",

Son Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) stumbles into work as a tutor for dense debutante Park Da-hye (Jeong Ji-so), whose dad is smarmy IT magnate Park Dong-ik (Lee Sun-kyun) and whose mother is fluttery, scatter-brained Park Yeon-gyo (Cho Yeo-jeong). Though he has faked his way into the job, a crush helps seal the deal, and paves the way for his sister to come aboard as an even less qualified art tutor for the family's brat savant son, Park Da-song (Jung Hyeon-jun). Things snowball when mom Kim Chung-sook (Chang Hyae-jin) heartlessly takes the place of the family's devoted cook and housekeeper (Lee Jung-eun), and dad Kim Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho, in an Oscar-worthy performance) slides into place as their chauffeur. But when things appear to be as easy as stealing candy from a baby, the family that uses together loses together, with one incredible development after another threatening their arrangement. Look, this is already one of the best-reviewed films of all time, and is among the Top 10 best-reviewed of the past decade — if you haven't seen it, see it. The title makes it sound like an '80s creature feature, but it's much more like '40s Hitchcock, and it just may be the foreign film that does what \"Roma\" (2018) couldn't quite do — win top honors at the Oscars over the Americans.",

Not many films show it, and not many films should. The direction, acting and cinematography is all well-done. But the story is lacking. I wouldn't have nitpicked on this if it was just another average film, but since it is considered as a masterpiece by many, I guess I'm allowed to nitpick. A well-shot film does not necessarily mean a well-made film. The things that happen in this film would not happen in real life. No way. Not ever. At least not this quick. The rich here are just depicted as stupid people which they seldom are in real life. Also there is little to none character development for the rich and the poor as well.

This is an exception.\nThe South Korean-made \"Parasite\" won the Cannes Palme d'Or award and has received five-star ratings from several critics.\nIt does, in fact, have a cleverly-crafted screenplay – several interesting twists and turns not easily foreseen.\nBut it also cynically exploits several mean-spirited, prejudicial and demeaning stereotypes.\nIt portrays the non-wealthy/poor as:\n• Lazy.\n• Unwilling to take pride in their work.\n• Obsessively scheming and calculating.\n• Predatory.\n• Uncaring.\n• Cruel, even more so toward other non-wealthy persons.\n• Brutal.\n• Deceptive.\n• Unhygienic.\n• Unambitious.\n• Untrustworthy, even toward extended family members.\n• Politically insensitive (they make great fun of North Korea's steps to de-nuclearize).\nConversely, it illogically portrays them as:\n• I.T. geniuses.\n• Brilliant improvisers.\n• Well-educated and fluent in multiple languages.\n• Possessing sharply-honed acting skills.\nMeanwhile, it portrays the wealthy as:\n• Kind.\n• Gullible.\n• Thoughtful.\n• Sensitive.\n• Unsuspecting.\n• Naïve.\n• Respectful and loving spouses/parents.\n• Incurious (the wealthy family prominently featured in the film isn't even aware of all the features of their own home)\n• Not revengeful.\nThe film's main message to the viewers is three-fold:\n• Unless you want to incur a boatload of bad karma, avoid being unkind and exploitative to the wealthy.\n• If, as a wealthy person, you allow the non-wealthy to become too deeply involved in your life as service providers, they will become the equivalent of sentient, malicious and deadly cockroaches in your home.\n• To protect your own family from great misfortune and the temptation to commit brutal crimes, aspire to become wealthy yourself.\nWhat those elite Cannes reviewers were thinking when they voted \"Parasite\" as the year's top movie is beyond me. Maybe Steve Bannon (Drumpf's white supremacist former adviser who was behind the machinations leading to Great Britain's Brexit referendum) stacked the voting deck, so to speak – who knows?",

I wish I could just divulge everything I was able to dissect of it from my first viewing, but then I would be spoiling it. I have SO MUCH to say about this and a lot I want to talk about. Alas, I will wait to do so until others have seen it as well.\nMasterfully crafted by Korean film director, Bong Joon Ho, Parasite is a mystery thriller that sucks the audience right in from the very beginning and doesn't let up until well after the film's final seconds. Arguably the best film I have seen in 2019, Bong Joon Ho fills this masterpiece with metaphors throughout and utilizes mise-en-scène to add depth and symbolism to the film's theme, story and ultimately to help guide the audience to the message he wants to convey.\nThe film's expertly written script has the right type of story beats to add layers to the world we see on screen and to introduce the inciting plot element at the right moment. The script builds off of that point in the film and smartly keeps the audience guessing and processing the events as they unfold on the screen. It all comes full circle in the film's final act that paints a rather harsh but truthful reality that many of us sometimes have to come to grips with in life.\nThought provoking and pulse pounding, Parasite is a film that deserves to be seen by all on the big screen. This is what cinema is all about.",

            "content": "A masterfully crafted tale of class warfare. Incisive, wicked, intelligent, dark (and funny)… one of the best films in years.\n\nif you haven't seen Parasite, go see it. It's a stunning achievement and one of the tightest, most sophisticated, clever, and intimate films of the 2010s, if not further. It's clear that director Bong Joon Ho had a vision, one that he expertly and concisely executed: One part struggle between the haves and have-nots (less economic anxiety and more class mobility), and one part darkly intrinsic look at family, society, and belonging. Without spoiling much that isn't in the trailers…\n\nThe film follows the impoverished Kims, living in the underbelly of Seoul—father Ki-Taek (Kang-Ho Song), mother Chung Sook (Hye-Jin Jang), son Ki-Woo (Woo-sik Choi), and daughter Ki-Jung (So-Dam Park)—taking whatever odd jobs they can (the film opens on one—folding pizza boxes). But a chance opportunity for Ki-Woo to tutor a wealthy family's daughter sets the stage for the film. It's not spoiling to say that the entire Kim family soon weasels their way into service for the wealthy family, the Parks, and more specifically the mother, Yeon-Kyo (Yeo-Jeong Jo).\n\nWatching the Kims infiltrate the Park household during the first half of the film is a sight to behold: Darkly comedic, whip smart, and incredibly incisive in its observation of both family's worldview. \"They are rich, but still nice,\" quips Ki-Taek. \"They are nice because they are rich,\" retorts his wife. A lesser movie would devolve into a clumsily depiction of a class war (eat the rich!), but the nuance and shades of grey Director Bong uses to create his characters and their world is as thought-provoking as it is entertaining.\n\nRather, Parasite becomes something else entirely… something darker. From the turning point—you'll know it when you see it—Director Bong really begins to twist audience expectation. In a relatively quick timeframe (in-movie time), the Kims, the Parks, and others find themselves in a series of incidents that are equal parts thrilling, vicious, and deeply saddening. The thrill ride the Parasite takes you on in the second half is indescribable without spoiling, but know that it's edge of your seat gripping, while still managing to keep its darkly humorous tone. By film's end, Parasite leaves you utterly floored and slightly hopeful, but only just so.\n\nThroughout the 131 minute runtime, but most vividly in the second half, Director Bong is working at the height of his powers. Without any fat or indulgence, Parasite is laser-focused on its satire of socioeconomic disparity. It doesn't beat the audience over the head with a hammer (like other notable 2019 films… cough, Joker), rather it surgically penetrates your psyche. It isn't black and white, there are no good or bad. There are only people. People in two distinctly different worlds. And ultimately, the choices these characters make to create their version of existence.\n\nHighlights: The camerawork, storytelling, and set design are astounding: No wasted space, no self-indulgent sets, and no extraneous storytelling. This entire film is a master at work. Parasite bursts with so much that it's impossible to highlight without spoiling.\n\nMVP: Park So-Dam turns in an aloof, yet charismatic performance as Kim Ki-Jung. And Yeo-Jeong Jo as Park Yeon-Ko dazzles as the bored, eager-to-please, worrying mother.\n\nShould you see it: You shouldn't be reading this, you should be buying a ticket right now. 10/10.",

It provokes a veritable roller coaster of emotions from hilarity to horror, heartbreak to awareness. \n\nThe acting is superb, every member of the cast makes a dramatic impact and each character is so distinct yet plays off the others so well. \n\nBut, the most impactful part of this film is the socio-political message it makes and the class clash. The economic inequality between people from different social classes is played out so enticingly well. The thoughts and behaviors that connect people and promote closeness among their personal interactions within their class is examined and shown so clearly. The ending is so perplexing. Even today, two weeks after I initially saw this film, I was discussing it with a colleague and we differed in how we perceived the ending. I may have to go see it again. It truly is a brilliant piece of filmmaking. \n\nThis is not a kid or family-friendly film, which we usually review. However, that being said, as a person who greatly respects the art of filmmaking, I felt compelled to review this one, which is outside the KIDS FIRST! norm.

I cannot help but sit in awe at Parasite. The film has a solid pace which allows the characters to be observed both in their natural habitat, and that which they invade. Outstanding acting and beautiful blocking allow Parasite to fill above and beyond the usual film, but what really shines is the script. A story difficult to place in terms of genre, it manages to lead the viewer towards each designed motion. A dramatical satire whose social commentary goes beyond riches, as it aims directly towards the nature of people and it is not afraid to go all the way in. In my opinion, a must-see in 2019, and also easily regarded as one of the best films of the decade.",

            "content": "Bong Joon-Ho's slow burning, indubitably Oscar-worthy film explores the subject of social classes in a meticulously calibrated (and metaphorical) manner and it's one of the most original, daring and astonishing thing I've seen in the cinema in years. Heavily infused with social commentary and satire, yet subtle enough to avoid any preachiness, this is the story of two families: the unemployed Kims are the lower class who lives in a tiny, literally sub-street level, apartment while the wealthy, upper class Parks luxuriate in a huge modern designer house. When an opportunity arises for Kim's son to tutor the Park's daughter, the Kims begin an elaborate plan to infiltrate the Park family. Just as you think you are settling in for an invasion thriller, the film pivots into an unexpectedly revelatory and gripping middle section that plays out like a tense hide-and-seek heist and culminates in an exquisite finale so jaw-droppingly outrageous that it can only happen in a Korean film. Using every cinematic language available dextrously to deliver something complex and thought-provoking, its cinematography is awe-inspiring (and pops even more on the big screen) and every screen composition and production design is brimming with meaning and specific significance. Minor contrivances in the plotting aside, the cleverly constructed script not only juxtaposes well the manner the Kims connive to better themselves with the Parks' obliviousness and inability to appreciate what they have, but refuses to give in to simple characterisations or resolutions. The Kims may be devious and ruthless but they are also aspirational and hard workers and good people at heart. Wickedly funny, tragically poignant, yet remaining positively hopeful, this entertaining and immensely (re)watchable film will overwhelm you with a myriad of emotions and thoughts and stays with you long after you left the cinema.",

This movie is about a poor family who all get jobs working for a rich family as part of a scheme, and it just gets crazier from there. The performances are excellent, the story is interesting, it looks beautiful, it has comedy, it has suspense, it has horror, it has romance, it has everything! My only complaints are that the movie is a little slow in the first act and that sometimes the dialogue went by too fast for me to read the subtitles. This is good writing, and I feel like I missed some of it. I'm a pretty slow reader though, so your experience may differ. And yeah, the movie is presented in its original language and subtitled. If that's an issue for you, don't see it. You won't enjoy it. Otherwise, if you want an exciting and well-made movie that is completely original, go see this movie!

            "content": "Parasite is a fascinating film because, while it consistently maintains focus on the same topic, it is constantly changing the style and genre of the film. At times it’s a comedy, then it’s a thriller, then it’s a con-artist/hustler movie, then it’s a horror film, etc. There are surprises around every corner in this movie, and that made it riveting to watch. I never once felt that I knew what was going to happen next, and that is such a freeing experience. I also have to commend Parasite for threading the needle and making a movie with protagonists who are unlikable, but getting me to care about them. It’s weird, but the way the film sets up their plan, it has just enough comedy that I kind of enjoy watching the devious plot unfold. There’s a twisted pleasure in seeing people that are clever enough to be a few steps ahead of everyone, even if their intentions are selfish. The cast of the film was wonderful, and many of them had to take on complex roles where they basically require 2 distinct personalities. However, Parasite wasn’t pure joy for me. I got annoyed later in the film that these people who seem so savvy start to behave like morons. The one thing that I could clearly predict in the film was something that they didn’t even seem to consider as a possibility. It isn’t a huge fault in the story, but it seems inconsistent with the characters that we see carefully planning so many details. I also thought at times Bong Joon-Ho went a little overboard with messaging in the movie. While it’s fairly obvious that the entire film is focusing on the differences in classes within Korean culture, it’s not like I need multiple scenes of people peeing in the streets to show the lousy living conditions of some people. There’s even a massive flood that doesn’t play into the plot in any way but to show the night-and-day difference between these two families. Despite any minor complaints, Parasite is a truly unique film, and one I can’t wait to watch again in order to pick up on all the details I missed the first time. If you know nothing about the film, then read no more, watch no trailers, and go see it...you won’t regret it.",

It was a struggle for me to keep myself as far away as I possibly could from reviews and articles about the film, but I am glad I did so, because I truly believe the best way to see it is to know nothing about it beforehand. \nParasite revolves around two families, one living in poverty, barely having enough money to eat every night, and the other, spoilt for riches, struggling to decide what to eat each night. The first half of the film shows the families interacting through an elaborate scheme that sees the entirety of the poverty-stricken family working under the same roof as the wealthy family.\n It is hard to reveal any more about the story without taking the experience away from the viewer, but what I can say is, the complete shift of tone halfway through turns this film from a dark comedy into a thrilling drama. It is a true testament to director Bong Joon-Ho that the film can change tone so frequently without creating unrest. Every tonal shift brings the audience along with it; you will be laughing one minute and in complete shock the next. Every scene is important to the direction the film takes, even the numerous, lengthy tracking shots have significant meaning behind them. There is one scene in particular, where the gradual build-up of tension explodes into one of the captivating twists that you will see this year.\nThe cinematography, production design and directing piece together the two halves of the world perfectly. The juxtaposition of the two houses that the characters reside in, are almost characters in themselves. The characters personalities change depending on which house they are positioned in, and the natural events occurring in the world can have significant repercussions on one house, but would leave the other unscathed. \nThere really isn't much you can say wrong about this film. It is one of the best films I have seen this year and perhaps even this decade.\nBong Joon-Ho gives such a unique take on poverty and the class differential that occurs worldwide. As the film gains traction coming up to the awards season, it will not only gain relevance, but create a discussion. Parasite is a true masterpiece from one of the best foreign film makers around today.",

Beautifully filmed and good acting across the board (although the bunker housekeeper character goes from demure to psychotic a little too quickly), the film clips along and keeps you guessing where it will go next. But with a storyline that involves amoral con artists scheming to take advantage of an amoral and clueless wealthy family, there is no one in this film who you will empathize with. There is an impending sense of doom from the start that offsets any attempted humor in the beginning of the film although it garners plenty of laughs in the theater. Midway through, the film takes an unnecessary and ridiculous plot turn and the violence builds to a frenzied crescendo that leaves you feeling that any point that was to be made of the rich feeding off of the poor and the poor being justified in feeding off the rich is lost in the mayhem. I often find writer+director-as-one films lack a tempered hand to rein in a tendency towards overindulgence: this is definitely true for Bong Joon Ho's \"Parasite.\"",

Joon-ho and Han Jin-won's screenplay (in addition the former's understated directing job) is excellent with perfect pacing that beautifully flows from scene to scene, and once he's done laying all his cards on the table, Joon-ho springs a set of vicious narrative traps that escalate into a thrilling, almost totally new film whose every minute is better than the last.\n\nWhether it's a casual passing remark, joke, or calculatingly placed visual, every single detail gradually coalesces into an immaculately tight piece about the relational tension between society's haves and have-nots. It's flooring not just how much, but how synergistically and open to interpretation Joon-ho crafts his film, particularly in his impressive ongoing visual motif contrasting the power disparity between high and low height levels. As well as being an effortlessly humorous, sinisterly horrifying thrill ride, there are heaps of love and care put into Parasite, and it shows on every bit of inch of screen as it plays.",

            "content": "Taste of Korea.  Now I would personally recommend going into this knowing nothing, but if you insist on having a small inkling, this is about a family of four, all of which are unemployed.  They get gifted with a rock that is said to bring its owner fortune, and they find themselves gradually becoming gainfully employed by a wealthy family under false pretenses.  How long will they be able to keep the ruse up?  Like I said before, I went into this knowing as little as possible about this on purpose.  What little I had seen recommended that I approach it in such a fashion, and Joon-Ho Bong is such a talented director that I heeded the warning.  I watched a trailer and that was about it, and I was careful to avert my eyes if anything popped up on social media.  I wasn't even sure what genre this would fall under, and that is the best way to take this movie in if at all possible.  Now what I most appreciated about Parasite is how many layers it has to it.  Sure, you can view this as a microcosm for a capitalistic society, and that all works, but even if you don't do that extra legwork, you can still get behind this twisty story as it is presented to you.  It is so rare that a movie can actually pull a surprise in this day and age, and even when you are sensing something big is about to happen, Parasite is excellent at constantly catching you off guard in a way that you don't see coming.  Even very early on with this, something is off and the story won't allow you to quite put your finger on it.  It pulls you in with this heist-like setup, and then it flips the script entirely.  Much like this family, it has got you hook, line and sinker, and you have an inherent need to see how this story is going to play out.  I never knew really at any point where this movie was going to end up, and for somebody who watches as many movies as I do, it made for a completely engrossing experience.  I just saw this three days ago and I can't stop thinking about it.  Joon-ho Bong blends genres seamlessly, and this covers comedy, thriller, mystery, and horror in the best way possible.  The dynamics of the story are always changing which is sure to make it an absorbing watch.  This was one of the few movies of 2019 that I went into with high expectations and they were all met.  The cinematography is terrific as is the acting, and as long as you don't mind reading subtitles, you should get ready for one of the best movies of the year.",

Though I would suggest avoiding all of it if you really want to get as much out of this film as possible. Family is certainly a strong theme as is class struggle if that helps.\n\nThe acting is all excellent. Song Kang-ho continues to be one of the best actors working today. The dude will have you cracking up and then choking up within minutes of each other.\n\nI'm not really able to talk about this film at length without spoiling it so I'll just say if you're a true fan of film, this is not one you can miss.

            "content": "This movie made us think.  Who's the good guy?  Who's the bad?  Everyone is both.  It reminded me of the Sopranos in that way.  The main character, Ki-taek. is like Tony Soprano.  He is a family man, indeed a leader of his family.  He is a visceral man.  He will fight for his family.  He plans.  Like Tony, he cannot bear certain kinds of slights.  For so many seasons, I understood Tony Soprano, but then it became too much.  For most of the movie, I understood Ki-taek, but then I couldn't.  \n\nThis movie is a social commentary about the haves and have-nots.  The haves are condescendingly kind.  The have-nots are left to bear that condescension in order to be half haves in their own right.  Then they too become ruthless but in a literal kiss up, kick down kind of way.  \n\nIt's a biblical like story with all the seven deadly sins woven in and out of the plot.  Like with the Bible, you have to suspend your sense of reason, especially when Ki-taek is left in the basement at the end of the story.  Of course, he could get out himself, or his son could just break in and get him out, but it is his penance to stay, just as Cain was left to wander.  Can the son succeed where the father couldn't?  Do we want him to when his dream is not to better humankind in some way, but to live in the dream house and be a have?  \n\nNo one learns their lesson and the human condition goes on.  Will any of these characters emerge to be Jesus?  There is no hint of that.  So the story leaves us without any hope.  No one even dreams of a Messiah.  No one yearns for a simple life with some love and kindness.  It's grim, like the Old Testament.",

The narrative of two families one wealthy and one poor, is told to perfection and it feels very realistic. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat waiting and waiting for the next thing to happen.

However, the movie soon took a very dark turn. I told myself repeatedly while watching Parasite: \"the professional reviewers had given it a 99% rating and it would soon improve\". I was wrong. Finally, in frustration towards the end of the movie, (I checked my watch and realized it had been two hours already), I stood up and walked out. It was the only satisfaction I had in watching I checked my watch and realized it had been two hours trying to watch this movie. this movie is not recommended by me.

And yes, it is just that damn good! Bong Joon Ho succesfully gave a light story and more comedy at the beginning, getting a little serious with a genre change in the middle, and gave us the perfect twist with that ending.\n\nThere's nothing more that I will spill about this movie, just go and see it for yourself since this movie will definitely blow your mind.

And the symbolism! (So much water-flooding water! and basements, and hidden sub-basements! And The Stone!) Ooh! \n\nBlech. All in service of a scattered, almost-pointless storyline, with...um...a healthy helping of unexpectedly gruesome graphic violence, along with a sprinkle of oddly clumsy couch-sex that will probably horrify anyone over 17. \n\nI dunno - maybe you like awful (subtitled) movies you have to go out of your way to see. Sometimes even I do. \n\nBut not this time. Don't say I didn't warn you.",

Really can't talk about the movie itself without giving spoilers, though none of them jolted and/or surprised me.\n\nThe movie is 2 hours and 13 minutes of which 13 minutes could have been cut very easily or spent in explaining some relationships that are sort of glossed over.\n\n\"Parasite\" takes place in Korea and the differences between the classes are made immediately. The film has subtitles that took me a few minutes to get used to but to which I adapted fairly quickly.\n\nI left the theatre glad I didn't walk out but at the same time I really can't see recommending it while, on the other hand, Allen thought it was a classic whodunit.",

With his latest feature, Joon-ho has crafted a fascinating portrait of a poverty-stricken family living in Korea. Using gorgeous cinematography, the Korean auteur draws viewers into the world of a poor family that dreams of becoming rich. From stunning establishing shots to intense close-ups, the cinematography elevates the movie to another level. Aside from excelling behind the camera, Bong Joon-ho draws excellent performances from his ensemble cast. In the year's most award-worthy Asian ensemble, every actor gets the chance to shine and leave a lasting impression. Kang Ho-Song is the most notable standout as the desperate father of the Kim family. With riveting expressions, he captures the plight of a father struggling to be accepted by his rich owners. Although \"Parasite\" is undeniably exhilarating, ultimately it is not a film without flaws. At nearly two and a half hours, it is slightly long and suffers from a lengthy running-time. Moreover, its blood-soaked finale is a little drawn out and tests the viewer's patience. Nevertheless, \"Parasite\" is a must-see and one of the best films of the year. At a time when the Hollywood studio system seems to be running out of ideas, it is joyous to be reminded that foreign films like \"Parasite\" are still getting made.",

            "content": "Just when I’d relax and settle into a genre comfort zone, this Korean film would change gears until by the final shift into overdrive I was convinced I’d exit the theater with whiplash. Caught in the wildly unpredictable intersection of two South Korean families, we flow, over 132 roller coaster minutes, from slice of life satire to laugh out loud comedy to murder mystery to thriller to horror. We first meet the Kim family: former Olympian medalist, no-nonsense mom, philosophic dad and their twenty-something children, a clever, jaded daughter and a cagey, articulate son. Together they live in a cramped subbasement with a single window opening to an alley frequented by urinating drunks. Cobbling together pay-as-you-go jobs, the destitute family of four assemble pizza boxes and post advertisement fliers but still can’t stretch their collective earnings to prevent cellphone shutdown. I was instantly empathetic as they doggedly scramble about their tiny, cluttered basement quarters looking for an unprotected neighborhood wireless signal to hijack. Who amongst us can’t identify with the duress and agitation of no internet? I remember wandering around my backyard one blustery night during a power outage holding up my open laptop searching for a signal and happily tucking myself in the corner woodpile to draft off a neighbor’s service. We are won over by these Kims, a likable and resourceful pack, resigned to underclass status, not from lack of will or skill, but as victims of ravaging unemployment. Marked by a distinct working class odor from subway travel and basement travails, let’s call them “down but not out.” Next up, their polar economic opposites, the Park family: fashionable, fretting mom, high tech dad, preening adolescent daughter and hyperkinetic young son. This family of four live in 1% luxury, their home a gated modern mansion of renown architectural pedigree, tended by a chirpy Brady Bunch Alice-type maid and chauffeured in a top of the line classic black Mercedes-Benz. We common folk cruise along voyeur-like momentarily drinking in the fascinating lifestyle of fame and fortune. As most of us are interlopers to the decadence spawned by riches, the Park family are never in danger of generating empathy, but neither do they stir antipathy. A family of nouveau wealth, deemed “of course” entitled to servants, they deflect lurking presumptions of elitism by pointing out that they pay their staff more than the market rate. Call them “nice.” From the introductory phase of meet the Kims, greet the Parks, the plot flirts with a quasi Prince and Pauper remix, here a twist, there a turn, here a sting, there a caper. Out with the old (the Park support staff), in with the new (the Kim conniving crew). We enjoy the antics of the two families bizarrely blended by means and needs, schemes and scams. It’s a fun frolic! Then ominous storm clouds roll in, thunder booming as the Park’s original merry maid stages a dramatic return, throwing a lighting bolt of double dealing deception causing the walls of hoax and trickery to come a-tumbling down. It’s not fun anymore. It’s frightening and vicious. The once comedic clash between social classes turns into a literal flood of ugly, cruel, vindictive and murderous rage. Suddenly, I’m watching a cinematic detonation, the black comedy explodes into thriller, then slasher, splaying the complex social, cultural and economic layers wide open, leveling the playing field of the haves and the have nots in an astonishing, jaw-dropping finalé. Don’t let anyone persuade you that Parasite represents a societal showdown between good and evil. This film noses around in all the nuanced gray areas, exploring and ultimately unleashing the pent up human dynamics of hope and despair, greed and want, power and pain. This creative, complicated, masterfully orchestrated film will be a hands down Oscar contender—and, if Academy voters can look past subtitles, Parasite will rack up recognition well beyond the Foreign Language category. It may not stick around very long so best see it soon. It’s (wink, wink) a peach",

            "content": "“Parasite” Review (10/10) Snowpiercer director Bong Joon-ho has made a South Korean social satire that's also a genre-bending Palme d'Or-winning thriller of class struggle. It’s best to go into “Parasite,” the Cannes Film Festival grand-prize winner by Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho, not knowing too much about what you’re about to see; the better to let its sly power sneak up on you. A dark satire of the class divide in contemporary South Korea, it’s the story of two families of four. You’ll watch knowing you’re in the hands of a master filmmaker; only wondering when it’s over how certain effects were achieved (a sequence near the end is a wonder), and losing yourself in these characters: particularly the gentle, wide-eyed anxiety of Mrs. Park and the way that Ki-woo’s father, a man who cheerfully recites his string of failed businesses, remains determined to somehow find a way to make his family prosperous again. The title metaphor becomes abundantly clear, is filled with vivid conversations that remind us how the Parks can’t imagine (or don’t care to imagine) how the other half lives. In one scene, they coolly discuss how poor people smell; like an old radish, says Mr. Park, or a rag that’s been boiled. Ki-woo’s family, however, seems to understand the rich all too well. What keeps you rapt in Parasite is the visual wit, every shot distills the movie’s themes, and the richness of the characters and performances: Song’s stricken expression as Kim Sr. is driven to murder by class resentment, Lee Jeong-eun’s swift transformation from a calmly efficient housekeeper to a keening madwoman, and Choi’s eloquent helplessness as his teenage protagonist watches this new world order gorily combust. At the heart of Parasite is the most gnawing evolutionary fear of all, the inability to protect one’s family. Parents work to save their children but lose them, as children lose their parents and wives their husbands. The bonds are firm but can withstand only so much pressure before they fracture. Who are the real parasites? The poor who attach themselves to the rich or the rich who suck the marrow of the poor? The movie dissects the universal gap between the haves and the have-nots with shocking wit, stinging topicality and gut-wrenching violence. It’s explosive filmmaking on every level.",

            "content": "This review may contain spoilers.\n\nOkay Juicers, I am going to make a confession. I am not a huge foreign movie guy, but I am absolutely trying. I saw The Farewell earlier this year, I saw Pain & Glory (review coming soon) and I saw Parasite. Parasite is the newest movie from acclaimed Director Bong Joon-ho. I was excited to learn about this guy and I will be diving into his filmography soon because I LOVED this movie.\n\nParasite is a story about a family who slowly embeds themself with a wealthy across the town. The do this by slowly taking over all the positions in the household. They maneuver the son to become the tutor, they maneuver the daughter as another tutor, they bring in their dad as the driver and the mom as the maid. Now they have to do some bad (but sometimes funny) things in order to achieve this, but the movie does a great job of making it seem natural.\n\nThe true greatness in this movie though lies in the tone. The way Joon-ho maneuvers your emotions from laughing to freaking out between scenes is unlike you see in very many movies. The way it is paced only only helps that tone because they never linger on anything which makes bouncing from the suspense to the comedy so easy. The tone also helps balance the class commentary throughout the movie. Clearly the director wants people to understand natural life in Korea and commenting on the classes was the best way to do that.\n\nStock Watch\n\nStock Up – Bong Joon-ho made waves with Okja and he is continuing the hot streak as I said above. This guy just seems like a Kubrick type where his movies really try to put a spin on genres, from what I have read. This was a masterclass in filmmaking and I will watch anything he does from now on. I mean look at him he clearly has cool friends…\n\n*A couple other tidbits\n\nWhen you first see the maid hanging from the wall pushing the bookcase you are like WTF. Easily second best WTF moment this year behind Midsommar.\n\nThe romance between the son and daughter of the two families was a little weird.\n\nParasite is easily the biggest surprise of the year for me, and I honestly wish people could make more movies like this. Yeah its not 100% perfect but its original and was gripping from start to finish. This is me telling you Parasite is a good movie…\n\nJuice Rating:\n92/100",

Starring Song Kang-ho as Kim Ki-taek, Jang Hye-jin as Park Chung-sook, Choi Woo-shik as Kim Ki-woo and Park So-dam as Kim Ki-jeong, this dark thriller has some bizarre comedic elements, and dredges through the South Korean societal classes with the depth and uncertainty as who is hero and villain. The multiple layers of struggle placed upon each character only adds to the brilliance of the story and culminates with an even greater crescendo when their whole lives start falling apart. Part horrific disaster, part  frightening emotional congruence and part a wonderful expose of the lengths a whole family would go to cover for each other and make sure that each of them gets the proper slice of the proverbial pie of life that they can muster.

Director Bong Joon Ho (best known for Snowpiercer) continues to showcase his skills at creating unique and disturbing storytelling. The combo of humor, suspense and violence lends this film an intelligent, yet visceral quality that's sure to stimulate and surprise. (Korean with subtitles)",

The movie tackles topics about social class so head-on in such an entertaining way, I found it mesmerizing. This movie kept my interest pretty much the whole way through and at each insane turn, I was always on the edge of my seat, because the atmosphere is tension-filled and uneasy all the way through. Even though the movie presents characters that do things that aren't necessarily likable it was fascinating to see them justify their actions.

            "content": "SEOUL SURVIVORS - My Review of PARASITE (4 1/2 Stars)\n\nIt would be understandable to watch the first ten minutes of Parasite, the new film from Bong Joon Ho (Snowpiercer, The Host) and think you've stumbled into an alternate universe version of Shoplifters.  Both feature an Asian family of grifters living in a hovel and preying on people with money.  Both won the prestigious Cannes Film Festival's top prize a year apart.  While both excellent films, Parasite is to Shoplifters what No Strings Attached was to Friends With Benefits. I won't chase comparisons any further than that, because Parasite is a staggering work of art worth putting on its very own pedestal.  \n\nBong Joon Ho has delighted in subverting our expectations within specific genres, whether it's a monster movie, a chase film, or an environmental issues farce.  His films have often explored the marked differences between the haves and the have nots.  With Parasite, he and co-writer Han Jin Won bring this social dichotomy to the world of the home invasion thriller, creating a masterful, screw-tightening, devastatingly powerful gut punch of a movie.  \n\nI'll set up the basic premise but spoil nothing in this review, as the surprises merit fresh eyes.  The Kim family live in a damp basement apartment which affords them a view of drunken men urinating right outside their street level window.  They subsist on odd jobs like folding pizza boxes and dream of better lives which they can see on their iPhones whenever they're able to piggyback onto their neighbor's WiFi.  This foursome, played by Kang-ho Song, a Bong Joon Ho regular, as the father Ki-taek, Hye-jin Jang as the mother Chung-sook, Woo-Sir Choi as the young son Ki-woo and So-dam Park as the daughter, deserve a break.  \n\nGood fortune strikes them one day when Ki-woo's friend tells informs him he's traveling overseas and needs him to cover for him as an English tutor for the daughter the wealthy Park family of four.  Ki-woo impresses the parents, who live in a sleek modern mansion in a well-to-do section of Seoul.  The father, Dong-ik (Sun-kyun Lee) owns a tech company and has the shuffling gait of a man used to his creature comforts.  The mother, Yeon-kyo (Yeo-jeong Jo) oozes compassion and beauty despite not always being aware of her surroundings.  They raise their young children in a bubble which gets burst wide open with the arrival of Ki-woo.  Soon, enough, the rest of the Kim family insidiously infiltrates the Parks' lives, and my story description ends here.  \n\nNeedless to say, Parasite draws you in with its basic premise and then, like the best of Hitchcock and Kubrick, turns it on its ear and makes you gasp.  The majority of the film delights in revealing every little shift which occurs in that gorgeously stark home until you slowly realize that everything has changed.  In an instant, however, things go bonkers (you'll know it when you see it), but it doesn't so much feel like a tonal shift as it feels like an organic extension of our poor family's desperation.  The film doesn't feature a human antagonist.  The Kim's do what they need to do to survive in a tough world, and the Parks are mostly kind to their employees, although they do separate themselves a bit by noticing that poor people have certain smells.  It's enough of a detail to evoke a ton of empathy for the Kims.\n\nMake no mistake.  This is a movie-movie.  It has grand set pieces and almost unbearable suspense.  I've never before witnessed the preparing of a ramen type dish in the context of a nail-biting moment, but there it is for Bong Joon Ho to mess with his audience for several agonizing minutes.  Same goes for a sliding shelf door, a living room table, a light switch, a flooding apartment, and an innocent enough outdoor party.  What the filmmaker seems to be saying is that what separates the classes is merely a thin veneer.  We're all one tiny moment away from losing everything.  \n\nIt doesn't hurt that the assembled cast shines.  I especially loved the interplay between Kang-ho and Hye-jin as the parents.  Their increasingly dire circumstances bring them closer together with each showing the other tenderness despite the mayhem. I also loved Yeon-kyo's guileless performance as the too-easily impressed mom.  Had she done a little Googling, she may have prevented what ensues, but she seems to love people, so it's hard to hate her.  \n\nFor a moment near the end, the air leaks out of the tires with a sequence slightly out of step with what precedes it.  I should have known better to question it, as Bong Joon Ho is a master filmmaker.  Of course it would swing around again to produce an unforgettably heartbreaking final moment.  It's up there with the great movie endings.  \n\nBong Joon Ho uses everything in his powers to achieve this instant classic. His cinematographer, Kyung-pyo Hong, understands how to present space in a frame and how to mine suspense out of every slight camera move.  Ha-jun Lee's production design presents a vivid contrast between the two main homes.  Jail Jung's orchestral score gives the film an appropriate heft, worthy of such big flights of musical fancy.  Parasite is a movie of its time as each of us circle around the ever-diminishing musical chairs.  We don't know when the music will stop, but when it does, some of us are in for a world of hurt.  At least we may still find beauty in it if great filmmakers like Bong Joon Ho have a seat at the table.",

While I haven't thought much about the film since it ended, it hasn't pestered me and forced me to ask difficult questions, which I typically assume a great film will do — when I think about my experience of watching it, the film shines as a radiant moment of what cinema can synthesize into a 2 hour experience.

I went into this almost completely blind, knowing nothing of it except for three small details: it's a foreign film; critics and film festivals are raving about it; and the poster is intriguing. It does not take much for a film to capture or forfeit my interest, and these three things were enough to capture me in this case. The movie opens with a four-piece family (husband, wife, son, daughter) shackled to poverty, all unemployed, making do with what they can get, when, suddenly, through the kindness of a friend, the son acquires a job tutoring the daughter of a very wealthy, identically four-pieced family. The newly hired son, together with his jobless sister, father, and mother, then concoct an elaborate scheme to get all of them, one by one, hired by the rich family, with the sister posing as an art tutor for the rich family's \"ingenious\" little boy, the father becoming the new chauffeur (after framing the old one), and the mother enlisting as the new housekeeper (after taking advantage of the old one's particular allergic reaction). This is only the basic setup of the movie; there is much, much more that happens afterward, and it only keeps getting better. The movie is simply fantastic, not just because of its exhilarating plot or its multi-angled perspective on class and societal dynamics, but also due to its impeccable acting. Everyone on camera is beautifully natural, relaxed, and invested, providing for a realistic, tangible experience that feels entirely believable even when things really get crazy. As I mentioned, this is a foreign film, so if you like that sort of thing and don't mind subtitles, this one definitely doesn't disappoint.",

            "content": "Parasite is another cenimatic master stroke from korean writer/director Bong Joon - Ho. As much as the trailers and the dark tone of the promotional materials would lead you to believe, this movie is a comedy, a tragic comedy that utilizes an extremely unique farcical tone that has been evolving through Bong's work for over a decade now. The story centers around a disenfranchised, and disaffected young man and a hapenstannce invitation to tutor an extremely rich family's daughter from a friend. The means by which he gains the position are dubious at best, utilizing forgery, lies and deception of a bumbling grifter. What builds from this first act of simple fraud is a ever increasingly hilarious complicated plan that sees his entire family employed at the well to do family's estate. On the surface, till halfway through the second act of the film there is a dark hilarity that weeds it's way through the writing crafting a stack of insaine lies that build to a point that, you the viewer know 100% it must end horribly and in tremendous fashion. The cinematography while masterful also blocks characters within each shot to create an almost imperceptible yet effective implied line that furthers the films tense feel as it approaches it's climax/resolution. The final act of the film is where Bong's directorial style and underlying message straight up sucker punches you in the gut. Gone is the light-hearted humor that we see from the onset and now in full force is a completely different story of a family hanging onto financial and familial stability that is only afforded to the elite in this world that is terrifyingly reminiscent of our current society. Who is the true parasite? The wealthy who have no conception of their fortune or the lying conartist that  take advantage of that blasé attitude to gain purchase in a broken economy? While this change in thought and mindset clearly strikes the viewer as bleak there still is humor in this shift, just of a more cynical and dark nature. Holding all these elements in balance is a work of brilliance that solidifies Bong Joon - Ho's status as one of the greatest directors of our time. Parasite recievrecieveses a solid 10/10.",

So my praise for its superb direction and clever storyline is tempered by my acknowledgment that it is \"just\" a very good movie but not in the quality stratosphere of, say,  \"Joker\".   The movie makes  a statement about the issue of class and status in South Korea, a theme that Psy explored with his hilarious \"Gangnam Style\" video way back in 2012.    But while Psy played it for laughs, Bong Joo-Ho plays it for chills.  Call it the movie version of \"Gangnam Style\" as directed by Alfred Hitchcock.  Bong artfully weaves this tale of happenstance, opportunism, cynicism and callousness into a morality play and a contemporary tragedy, but at the end I am asking myself; Is he saying that wealth makes people less human or poverty makes people less caring about the question itself? Ultimately I felt no sympathy for anyone, except the fired housekeeper who hated peaches.",

            "content": "Parasite is a modern day masterpiece even though it's not one of my favorite films nor is it my favorite film of the year. I have one tiny issue with the film but it is more of a nitpick. The film's message is a little on the nose but I don't have a huge issue with it but it is noticeable. Other than that, this film is perfect. There is not one bad performance in the movie. Cho Yeo-jeong, Park So-dam, and Kang-Ho Song are standouts from the film. All 3 of them have some of the best acting of the year. Their work with a fantastic script that is incredibly well written and clever makes their performance so much more enjoyable. Another aspect I loved was the cinematography. The film's slow camera movements and slow tracking shots look absolutely beautiful which go along great with the fantastic production design. The film's story and themes make this film incredible. The story of this poor family slowly infiltrating a rich family only to find out that their house is not what it seems. It's so incredibly tense. You never know what is going to happen next and it's always surprising to see what eventually happens. The film has themes of class divide and class warfare throughout which are very profound. The rich family says these lines about how great their life is while the opposite is happening to the poor family. Every time this occurs, you see how the poor family reacts and makes the scene and film itself dramatically more tense. Another thing I liked about the film was the score by Jung Jaeil. His score adds so much more to the tension. I know I'm using the word tension a lot but that's what this film is. A constant build up of tension scene by scene until it all culminates in the finale. For me, each passing scene left me more and more on the edge of my seat. One final aspect I want to touch on is the humor. Most of the jokes are cleverly written and while some of the jokes may not be that funny, I do appreciate how they were cleverly inserted instead of incredibly forced. Except this film to be on a bunch of Top 10 lists at the end of the year. Overall, Parasite is a fantastic film with great acting, great cinematography, and a powerful story about class divide even if its message may be a little too on the nose.",

There's so much to every layer of this movie, and co-writer/director Bong Joon-Ho's refreshingly specific vision is the fulcrum of it all. The narrative is so unique, featuring a latter half that's chock-full of events you absolutely can't see coming. The imagery and colors within each frame grow in terms of vibrance as the film goes on.

The actors,Portraying this asion family work well wirh each other, as they con their way into these jobs with this rich family. Never letting on that they are together.  Detail was in each scene by this director. Everything was thought out. Also the asian influence, culture. The movie kept me on my feet, not boaring at all. There is a comedy aspect, and a real reality that comes into it, with how people get taken advantage of, but also the devision of rich, vs poor. How each one plays out their part in this movie really makes you laught, and think, how this could happen. Then just when you think it is over, the last part of the son wanting to buy this house, kind of was not believeable. That was a bit much,after all these stabbings. but then i realized he was dreaming of it one day. But at least knows where his father is, still in this house bacement hiding from the law. The morris code really works. Love this film, best one seen yet, everyone i talk to, has a friend that recomends this film. Now i am also. I am a cinama student. It deserves more awards.

I was always quite selective of the movies outside hollywood, as I usually find them quite uninteresting and too cultural, but ,man, this was a great cinematic experience. I actually started wondering what else i have been missing from South Korean cinema. When a film blends, dark comedy with suspense and drama, it usually becomes too much to handle and it fails. But not here. You would think that  a title like ''Paradise'' would hold a more symbolic place within the movie but this is not the case. You know who is the parasite and who is the host.  The pace of the movie is fast and never lets you go. The comedy is subtle and brilliant at moments, but you know that this will not end well. That's parasites usually do, they destroy/kill the host. The transition from comedy to drama is done masterfully with great moments of suspense. Great story and wonderfully filmed. The cinematography is fantastic, as there are moments where you could stop it and keep it as a wallpaper in your laptop. The locations do not distract from the movie, they actually support the argument the film is trying to make. Amazing!",

            "content": "Director Bong Joon Ho has been on my radar for years now, as I believe him to be one of the best storytellers out there right now. Admittedly, I haven't seen the majority of his films but his two most recent works in Snowpiecer and Okja were among the best films of their consecutive years. I thought both of those films were great, so I was very eagerly awaiting his newest film, Parasite. After viewing, not only does this film deserve to be talked about as one of the best films to be released in 2019, but I personally think this may just be the very best movie you'll see all year. Now, some people may not like the turn it takes, but here's why I think Parasite demands to be seen.\n\nTo go into detail about this premise would be to ruin it for those who haven't seen it, so I'll stick to the basics here. The Kim family lives in a basement living space. All unemployed, they find any way they can to make things work. Ki-woo, the eldest sibling in the family, is given the opportunity to tutor the daughter of the rich Park family. Getting smarter and smarter as the first act really kicks into gear, the Kim family becomes a group of very clever con-artists. Meaning well and doing everything they can to keep things legitimate, this makes for some terrific tension.\n\nThe biggest praise I can give this film is that it's constantly in motion, never wasting a moment to surprise you. The set-up for this movie has many clever aspects to it, the second act throws you a real curveball and the finale doesn't disappoint either. Some viewers may think this movie goes off the rails toward the end, but I found it to be an overall brilliant piece of storytelling. Each time you think the movie has said everything it wants to, it becomes that much more interesting. In other hands, this story could've have come off as a very generic film, but there's truly something special about how well-made Parasite is.\n\nWonderfully shot by cinematographer Kyung-pyo Hong, each frame of this movie has more than one thing to say. It's very rare these days that shot compositions are done in such a way that they seem to tell a story as well, but even in the moments when the focus is on the characters alone, there are things happening in the background or even signs in the framing that things are coming soon. This movie is brilliantly made in every way.\n\nIt's very rare when I review a film and struggle to at least come up with one negative here, so I won't bother trying, because I loved this movie too much to let anything take away from it. I will just say that certain aspects may not work for everyone. Parasite is a perfect example of why I love movies so much. A great, engaging story that surprises you from start to finish, along with one of the best crews to work on a film yet this year. I can't praise this film enough. This Korean language film has broken through and I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest if it takes home the award for best foreign film and even a nomination for best picture. This is as close to a masterpiece you can get today.",

There were some nice touches of revelatory imagery and clever dialog that reinforced the theme, but I wasn't convinced of it's publicized greatness.

Set in Korea we follow a young man named Ki-woo (Kang-ho Sang) who is unemployed and struggling along with the rest of this family: his crafty sister Ki-jung (So-dam Park), his ex-driver dad Ki-taek (Kang-ho Sang) and his mother Chung-sook (Hey-jin Jang). One day Ki-woo is proposed by an old classmate of his to take over and help teach a rich family's daughter english. Ki-woo jumps on this and has his sister falsify documents, so that he appears to be a University student. The day finally comes and Ki-woo meets the Park family. He begins tutoring the young girl named Da-hye (Ji-so Yung) who isn't really interesting in studying. Meanwhile Mrs. Park (Yeo-jeong Jo) hires Ki-woo and also begins to slowly tell the story of her family to Ki-woo. Ki-woo see's this opportunity to get his family all jobs and slowly, but surely begins gaining the trust of the Park family one by one. There's much more to this movie, but I don't want to ruin it. I found this movie to be super smartly written, has a good mix of a fantastic plot plus some very funny moments, but most of all I actually thought the pacing was great. Not once in it's 2 hour and 12 minute run time did I find myself bored. It has a great story and some really beautiful shots here. I liked the message about the family being a parasite and sort of taking over, but there's a lot more meaning hidden there too. It is a foreign film, so the movie has subtitles (it's Korea after all), but hopefully that doesn't matter and you check this movie out!",

            "content": "October 11, 2019 (limited)\n\n\"When there are no plans, nothing can go wrong.\"\n\nIt isn't until the final act of Bong Joon-ho's \"Parasite\" that we realize this has been Kim Ki-taek's personal mantra for years. In a way, it's also his defense mechanism, because it guards him from feeling like a failure or deluding himself into thinking he's someone he's not. \n\nKi-taek (Song Kang Ho) is a weary-looking man of about 50 whose main source of solace is his family, and like many like many men living in his scruffy neighborhood, which sits at the bottom of a hilly city in South Korea, Ki-taek has fallen on harsh economic times. He lives in a low-ceilinged, elbow-to-wall apartment with his wife Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin) and their two twentysomething children—son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) and daughter Ki-jung (Park So-dam). \n\nAs a family, the Kims are close, resourceful and band together to make ends meet, such as tapping into nearby Wi-Fi networks for free Internet access and performing odd jobs like folding mounds of pizza boxes for a meager paycheck they all share. Naturally, the Kims desire a higher standard of living, and so when Ki-woo's college-educated friend, Min (Park Seo-joon), suggests Ki-woo take over his job as English tutor for the daughter of an affluent family, the other members of the Kim household think it could be an opportunity for all of them to reap the benefits of a rich lifestyle.\n\nAnd so, one by one, the Kims scheme their way into the employ of the rich Park family, whose posh, modern mansion sits high above the city slums. Their serene home is everything the Kim's is not, with 10-foot high ceilings; shiny, wooden floors; large, classy furniture; a fully stocked refrigerator and pantry; a heavily fortified garage; and a fully enclosed backyard with green grass and lush, perfectly maintained landscaping. Who wouldn't want a piece of this luxury pie?\n\nShortly after Ki-woo impresses Mrs. Park (Cho Yeo-jeong) with his tutelage skills and entices her and her business tycoon husband (Lee Sun-kyun) to hire him as the new English teacher for their daughter, Da-hye (Jung Ji-so), Ki-jung manages to get hired as the art teacher and child therapist to the Park's rambunctious son, Da-song (Jung Hyun-joon). Ki-jung then plants a piece of incriminating evidence that gets the current chauffer fired, allowing Ki-taek to promptly fill the position, in spite of his notable stench. They then work on getting the longtime, dedicated housekeeper (Lee Jung-eun) canned, and who should come along at just the right time but Chung-sook. Soon enough, the entire Kim clan, each assuming a fake identity, makes up the Park's household staff and are quickly basking in the rich family's amenities, going so far as to ransack their fridge, get drunk, and squat in their house when the Parks decide to go camping for the weekend.\n\nGiven this somewhat silly and lighthearted setup, why isn't it until late in the film that we come to learn of Ki-taek's solemn \"no plan\" policy? Because up until about the halfway mark, \"Parasite\" functions as sort of a whacky, slightly over-the-top dark comedy and edgy social commentary about the absurd and drastic differences between the rich and poor. It's a funny, scathing, and often punchy look at the effects of an unfair and unbalanced economy that's felt the world over, and even though the Kims act immorally in the way they get the Park's current employees fired and exploit the family's trust and possessions, they're essentially likable and relatable people and we understand their motivations. They simply want to feel comfortable and worthy, and we can hardly blame them for that.\n\nJoon-ho initially seems intent on telling an amusing, almost slapstick story, especially when the Kims have to act quickly when Mrs. Park calls Chung-sook from her car and instructs Chung-sook to start boiling water for udon, because the Parks have decided to cut their camping weekend short and they'll be home in eight minutes! Suddenly, the Kim's weekend of decadence and lazing about becomes a mad dash to save their jobs and protect their true identities. \n\nYou might expect the film to become more screwball at this point, but instead of staying a flippant course, Joon-ho and Han Jin-won's ambitious screenplay takes an unexpected turn. The film remains punchy, but it now packs a different kind of punch, and what was a medium-hearted, sometimes vulgar comedy has suddenly become a violent, disturbing dramatic thriller, one that's sad, downbeat, cynical and eventually tragic.\n\nIt's hard to go into detail without spoiling the film's many shocks and surprising developments, but what I can tell you is that no matter what filmic persona \"Parasite\" assumes, it keeps viewers in its grasp and glued to the screen, no matter how preposterous it may seem. If the first half made us laugh and perhaps even hope for these down-on-their-luck characters, the second makes us think, sympathize and either cover our eyes or rub our heads in despair.\n\nI'm tempted to tell you more, but I really should leave it at that. Just know the film reveals a hidden layer, both figuratively and literally, when it introduces a new character with a heartrending yet perfectly credible history, and the story works to remind us, all the way up to its horrific and chaotic climax, that at the end of the day, it's in our nature to protect our families first, no matter the cost to others or ourselves.\n\nIf this has got you curious about where \"Parasite\" goes, that's the point, and I would advise you to go into it as cold as possible and simply allow it to enwrap you. Perhaps then you'll see why the film has garnered so much praise and attention since its release, not least winning the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. \n\nWhile I agree \"Parasite\" is certainly worthy of its acclaim, I think it's important to remember it's not just the film's provocative final act and somber ending that lend it its value, even though it will likely be these elements that leave the greatest impression on viewers. As powerful and effective as they are, I found its simple observations of its characters' everyday behaviors, as well as the juxtaposition of a rich and poor lifestyle, even more engaging, because it's these grounded, less theatrical aspects that inspire us to reflect on our own humanity and realize it's our quotidian, mundane actions that define who we are, for they are our means of survival. Long before its story turns dark, gruesome and emotionally charged, \"Parasite\" reiterated in me that not everyone has the same opportunities and resources, and therefore we must be mindful, compassionate and respectful of others as we go about our dull, daily routines because they can be drastically different for everyone, right down to finding food and shelter.\n\nIt shouldn't take violence and high emotions for us to see how imbalanced the world has become. As we persevere through an increasingly cynical and divisive world climate—politically, economically, socially—the lighter and more jocular first half of a film like \"Parasite\" should be enough to stir and impact us. We shouldn't have to endure tragedy before making an effort to change a broken system.",

You will walk away and think about it for hours afterwards (as I did). Korean foreign film so that means subtitles (suck it up, you can handle it) but also one of the most unique films I have seen all year. A comedy wrapped in a thriller wrapped in a subtext. Took 40 minutes into it for me to even understand the title relating to the story, that's how slow Bong Joon-ho lays down the context and characters. Once you are drawn into the magnetic performances the film hits the high end of the roller coaster you were not expecting. You get jettisoned out of the end of the tunnel completely stunned by the visual aesthetic and floored by the social ideology he so deftly highlights. At moments that commentary is funny, sometimes blunt, and ending in a somewhat awestricken conclusion, with powerful effect. At no point is any side of the story lesser than or greater than the other. You sympathize with all parts of the machinery of class structure that he is trying to humanize and address. It is mostly jarring once you delve through the layers of comedy and surprise to dig deeper into the disparity of classism that he is nakedly trying to shed a scary (and unfortunately all too real) light onto. This film will move you deeply and you will carry the ideas and alluringly beautiful imagery of Korea with you for days..\n\nHighest recommendation I can give.",

Very little is believable about the poor characters here, while the rich seem quite human and believable. Yes, if it can be believed, we have a class-consciousness film that skewers the poor more than it skewers the rich. \n\nThe film that wanders back and forth from satire to caricature. The father of the poor family -- one of the main characters -- actually ends up as the cockroach his wife calls him, literally scampering about for food in the dark when the rich are asleep. We realize as the credits roll that the filmmaker is calling the poor \"parasites\" -- even if clever ones. The film even presents the time-honored critique of the \"smell\" of the poor to appear realistic: Yes, these poor people probably smell a little bit like their subway and/or their sub-level home. Who makes a film to skewer the poor? \n\nThe rich, meanwhile, come across as mildly distasteful but fairly kind, loving, and reasonable. You don't quite root for them, but you also hope they don't end up utterly as unwitting hosts of parasites. It's unrealistic that they would be so utterly duped, so you know the rich will be ok.\n\nBut then there's the needless violence at the end, and again we're in a cartoon. \n\nVery good acting, to be sure, clever dialogue at times, and some good cinematography too. So it's not all bad. Production values are relatively high. But ultimately it's a pointless movie, an insulting portrait of humanity I hope to forget soon.",

The best movie I have seen this year.  A dark comedy at first, it takes so many twists and turns, I was very vocal throughout the film. I became very involved with the characters and story line. It was a social commentary on classes of society, but I won't reveal anymore.  My favourite quote from the movie was \"The best plan is no plan at all. It saves getting upset when it all fails\".   This will all make sense when you MUST see the film.   Of course nothing but top marks for this one. \n\nCheck out my review blog\nhttps://wordpress.com/view/reviewsbyjohnny.movie.blog",

Bong Joon Ho and Han Jin Won have written and produced a beautiful, funny, disturbing and a little bit sad movie. The cinematography, editing and acting was also very good. But at the beginning of the second half of the movie, that magic vanished. It opened a new story with new problems for the protagonists. And also the last 5 Minutes of the movie is for me a little bit disappointing. But all those negative opinions I just write will not destroy the joy and tense, that this movie is going to give you.

            "content": "The working class and down on their luck Kim family struggle to make ends meet. When a friend of the son, Ki-Woo's, who is an English tutor for the daughter in the wealthy Park family, has to leave his position, he recommends Ki-Woo for the job. Now having an \"in\" with the wealthy family, the Kims begin plotting the downfall of the current household servants and inserting themselves into those vacant positions, making them all gainfully employed and with money finally flowing into the household. But not everything is as it seems in the Park house or with their previous servants.\n\nThis movie starts out as a comedy and quickly goes into social commentary, pointing out the differences between the poor working class family and the wealthy privileged family. The differences are ones that get commonly pointed out with the well-to-do having what usually gets termed as first-world-problems, while the poor family is literally trying to survive and save meager possessions in a flood. It doesn't shy away or try to be subtle about it, but interestingly enough, we don't feel beaten over the head with it either, which is a major change from the ham-fisted approach taken by most filmmakers. Couching this in a comedy is a good approach, as well, as the audience's guard is let down and we become more receptive to the ideas.\n\nHowever, I do say it's MOSTLY a comedy. The third act takes a dark, dark turn, and the contrast, not to mention general disdain and even indifference, between the classes becomes much more severe. This gets into some hard territory, and characters that we've found quirky and even come to like in some ways show very different sides of themselves. At the same time, it doesn't feel unexpected, almost like we could tell that this was under the surface all the time and tried to ignore it, but aren't surprised by it when it does show up. This is some masterful characterization!\n\nAnother aspect of note is that this film is rich in allegory and metaphor. It's a smart film, yet at the same time the filmmakers are not condescending about it. They give the audience credit for being able to understand the symbolism and don't spoon feed you everything, which is a refreshing change from the usual head-beating most filmmakers go for. At the same time, they understand that not every audience member will understand or immediately pick up on every symbol, but they have crafted this so carefully and so perfectly that you don't have to understand each and every one. That understanding merely enriches the experience, but isn't essential to it.\n\nThis film has gotten some recognition, and deservedly so. It is rich, intelligent, and polished to a degree that we sadly don't see as often as we should nowadays, showing the filmmakers are masters of their craft. This is easily one of the best films I've seen in 2019. Highly recommended!",

            "content": "\"You know what kind of plan that never fails? No plan. No plan at all. You know why? Because life cannot be planned.\"\n\n'Parasite' is absolutely fantastic. I'm still buzzing how good this movie is. Unpredictable and nuts. You know, this summer I was starting to get a little worn out with the endless sequels, remakes and soulless crash grabs, so I find it refreshing we get movies like this once awhile.\n\nI admire Bong Joon-Ho as a director, especially his Korean movies. Not to say I dislike his English language films like 'Snowpiercer' and 'Okja', but in my personal opinion those don't match the same quality as his Korean movies and there isn't a sex pest trying to control his work. Anywhere, Bong Joon-Ho is one of the best working directors alive and 'Parasite' proves it.\n\nThe movie perfectly blends drama and comedy so effortlessly, it basically breaks the impossible. And the comedy is actually hilarious and well written with the execution being sold on the actors. The thing I love so much is how funny, thrilling and intense the movie can be, hijacking all senses and emotions all wrapped into one - only a few directors can pull something this unique.\n\nThe performances from everyone was brilliant and there's so much depth to each character, they make the movie as captivating as it is. The cinematography was beautiful, the music was remarkable, and the movie says so much it's the reason why I was engaged throughout.\n\nI highly recommend people to avoid knowing anything before going in, because trust me it will add to your experience.\n\nOverall rating: Finally, a breath of fresh air. My second favorite movie of this year.",

Two great and very different films. Imagine a hardcore art house audience sitting through a monster film and loving it! That was the reaction to \"The Host\" and I will never forget it... Later on I saw Snowpiercer and liked it but I have to admit the last scene of  his \"Mother\" completely blew me away.Up to now I thought it was his best film and then last night I saw \"Parasite\"...Yes Bong Joon Ho is a great and original talent to come along. Parasite is well written and well acted and very suspenseful at points. Best roller coaster ride I have had in the cinema in a long time. Nice to think of mainstream audiences who usually don't go see a foreign language film going to see this one- by sheer word of mouth. Its a good one- very deep in meaning. It will make you think...

The film and its climaxes kept going on and on, feeling like almost three hours. Numerous bizarre actions are never fully clarified, and at least two major characters do things at the end that are not fitting of their characters, and implausible. One action remains eating at my brain because it made no sense whatsoever. I'm sure many critics feel the same as I do about some of this overwritten insanely contrived nonsense, but they just don't want to admit it. Because the first half of the film is so good. \n\nSorry folks, a WHOLE film needs to be great to be called a \"masterpiece.\" Not just parts. The ending reminded me of the vast departure from realism I felt when watching Snowpiercer. But it worked in that film because of the genre. It doesn't work here because mega contrivances stick out in dramatic stories. And there were so many of them. One is bad enough per film. But this has about as many as Crash, and then some.\n\nThe actors are all terrific. And they made it bearable for me. And the cinematography is stunning and shockingly artistic. But don't believe the hype. You could be disappointed. But if you are a viewer that has no problem with utter contrivances being flung at you from EVERY direction in the climax, then this film is for you. Oh, and some of the plot is just totally absurd and implausible. And we are supposed to cheer these people on? One family is utterly mean spirited. And we are asked to care about them at the end. \n\nAnd the things we are asked to believe are just too far-fetched. And characters change vastly, in a split second, according to the convenience of the writers. And some of these contrivances are predictable. I saw one coming from a mile away. I guess maybe this film is for people who haven't seen enough films to be adept at spotting when they're being manipulated. Enjoy this violent mess. I couldn't. And I still don't know what all happened on the lawn. Overly staged inflated action that made little sense. \n\nAwful, overall.",

The son Ki-woo lands a job as an English tutor for the daughter in the uber-wealthy Kim family, and through a series of schemes, the entire family is working there. Everything runs smoothly until one of the displaced servants shows up unexpectedly when the Kim family is away on a camping trip. The movie is fantastic; the performances by all are great, but what most stands out for me are the screenplay and the staging of the scenes. The screenplay is sharply written; the dialog is tight, incredibly funny, and dark at the same time. One of the things I liked about Snowpiercer, his previous film, is its take on class and class difference; the director elevates this to a new high in this film, where the differences become more and more apparent as the film progresses. The scenes are shot in a way that accentuates the disparateness of the two worlds reflected by the families. I cannot recall a film where I was so aware, in nearly every scene, the magnitude of the differences in how the rich and the poor live and experience life. The film is full of surprises; you are carried along with one expectation, then the next scene does something that jerks you into a different emotional reality. When the former servant arrives, you are yanked from what starts off as a hilarious social satire into a whole different world that is oddly funny, much, much darker, and yet even sharper in its message about class differences. Huge thumbs up for a film that combines social satire, dark humor, and elements of the best horror/thriller movies into one amazing piece of filmmaking. This is definitely my favorite movie of the year so far.",

            "content": "Parasite is the latest from award-winning South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho (Snowpiercer, The Host, Okja) and it won the prestigious Palm D'or at the Cannes Film Festival. The filmmaker has never settled down in any genre and often goes for broke when it comes to embracing whatever genre he is dabbling in and then subverting, accelerating, and broadening that territory to show an audience what a master can do with these storytelling parameters. No movie under Bong Joon-ho's guidance is ever limited by its genre. Needless to say, I've been highly anticipating Parasite, even more so since the critics started bandying about terms like \"masterpiece.\" Simply put, Parasite is a miraculous movie.\n\nWe follow the Kim family who live in a scummy basement apartment on a filthy street known for public urination. They scam free wi-fi off their neighbor and badly fold pizza boxes for little money. They're barely hanging by on the outer edges of society when opportunity comes knocking. A rich family, the Parks, is in need of a new English tutor for their teenage daughter, and Ki-woo Kim (Choi Woo-sik) has the connection. He will pose as a college-educated English teacher, recommended from his friend, the departing tutor. He gets the job and sees further opportunity, eventually scheming to get each member of his family hired; sister Ki-jung Kim (Park So-dam) as an art therapist for the Park's troubled son, father Ki-taek Kim (Song Kang-ho) as the personal driver to the family, and mother Shung-sook Kim (Jang Hye-jin) as the housekeeper and personal assistant for the family. The Kim family gains further leverage as they worm their way inside this house, but there are secrets that will force them to readjust how far they are willing to go to service this bourgeois family and keep their good lies rolling.\n\nParasite just unfurls with such natural ease, building and developing outward, building its characters, their problems and deceptions, and then, like that, it effortlessly turns gears toward another tone, and you weren't even aware it was happening until after the fact. Bong Joon-ho's film is so exact and impeccable and calculated that the pieces are move in tandem like a well-oiled machine. The synchronicity is so amazing that I often had to acknowledge how effectively the movie had surprised or satisfied me. There isn't a wasted moment in the 130 minutes here, which begins as a fun con game between one family of shady grifters working their way inside a rich family's trust. From there, the movie gets even darker, more mysterious, outlandish, and even more mournful and delightful. There are moments of slapstick comedy that had me howling, divine sequences of tension that felt ready to explode, and regular emotional punches to the system that reminded you that despite everything these are still people capable of great suffering and great feeling. Parasite is a rare movie that works on near every level, each facet of filmmaking operating at such precision that it blends together to create a masterwork of tone and tenor that is universally accessible, brimming with menace and glee.\n\nThere's a simple pleasure to be had watching a con artist at play, so there's even more amusement when we're watching a family of con artists all spinning lies in tandem. The process of escalation is so clean and believable in the world's universe, with the first family member using their position of influence to manipulative the family into hiring the next family member, even if that means scheming to get rid of the Park family servant already occupying that desired position. The Park family matriarch is all about personal recommendations and using a tight circle of trust; however, the Kim family exploits the obvious loophole of what if the initial link in that chain is untrustworthy him or herself? Initially I thought the movie was going to be watching this one family worm their way into the lives of the rich and powerful and take over, and while that is true to a certain extent, the movie is thankfully even more than that. Still, the con aspect alone is highly entertaining and so naturally plotted, with each new addition feeling organic from the last. There are natural complications that provide new challenges for the family of con artists to maintain their shifting covers and having to think on their feet, and there isn't a moment relating to these antics where Parasite is not completely compelling and darkly funny even as it veers into extremes.\n\nIf you're thinking that the Kim family is the obvious target of the movie's parasitic titular allusion, slow down, my friend. While the Kim family is more obvious about their deceptions, the Park family too is filled with the deception of civility, kindness, and graciousness. At first, we laugh at them because of a general naivete that allows the Kims to flourish. As the Kims successfully roust different servants, they are routinely dismissed without much thought. Some of these people have been with the family for years and otherwise have spotless records, but all it takes is one whiff of impropriety and the Parks are already scrambling to cut them loose, usually very unceremoniously and immediately, with the misplaced idea that this will somehow be the \"nice\" and \"respectful\" way of handling a dismissal. They're so quick to turn on people they feel are disloyal or incompetent, but really, it's the disloyal aspect, that they can be manipulated so easily by the Kim family's suggestions and assertions. Never once do Mr. and Mrs. Park ask for their servants' side of the story; they accept the accusations with minimal evidence are gung-ho about removing their formally trusted help as if they have been waiting for these moments.\n\nThe movie becomes a parable of exploitation and the consequences of avarice, and I'm going to do my best to dance around some significant spoilers that reshape the film in its second half. At one point the Kims have all made themselves at home in the luxury of the Park estate while the family is away on a camping trip. It's carefree wish fulfillment, lapping in the excess, and then over a drunken family dinner, Mrs. Kim says that if she had this kind of money that she would be as nice as Mrs. Park (appears). For her, money is like an iron and irons out all the problems of life, and as a family that has constantly been hustling for their next dollar, to be free of cares and worries would be the ultimate luxury. However, there is naturally more to this estate and the Park family, and the movie takes some dark turns into a battle over status and how far people will go to protect what they feel belongs to them. This is acted out in very personal ways and also in larger metaphorical waves, which adds to the overall class warfare satire. What starts off as a spiky little con comedy becomes something deeper and more challenging, expanding its targets to indict everyone jockeying for position in a system that seems corrupted to a fault.\n\nEven as the Kim family is scheming and conniving, there are still moments that remind you that they aren't these smooth, amoral con men of the movies and are real human beings with real feelings and real insecurities. There's one moment Mr. Kim overhears his boss casually talking about him, and it's very complimentary except for one admission. Apparently, Mr. Kim has an odor to him that the rich man finds to be rather unpleasant (he describes it like an old radish). No matter the suits he puts on, no matter the politeness and charm he manifests, no matter his skills when it comes to being a dutiful driver, no matter the gaps that Mr. Kim feels he is surpassing, there will always be something innate to him that stops him from being accepted and integrated in this cherished, cordoned-off land of the rich. His very smell is offensive to the noses of the rich, and this is something so personal, so nasty, that it genuinely wounds the man and we feel for him. Bong Joon-ho asks his audience to embrace all sorts of uncomfortable positions, taking characters you found despicable and asking to see them as real human beings capable of great loss and shame. It stops the movie from feeling like it's treading into cartoon territory even as its violence and physical comedy ramps up in the second half. It never loses a sense of its soul.\n\nKi-woo Kim asks his father, after several setbacks, what their plan is next, how they will persevere against the latest setback. Mr. Kim answers that his trick is to never have a plan, because plans will inevitably fail. This is a nice character moment but also an insight into a perspective that leads to what I would argue is the emotional climax of the movie, where Ki-woo pledges to save someone through an elaborate and years-in-the-making plan. In that moment, is he rejecting his father's philosophy and driving forward on what will be at minimum years of hard work to reach his goal, which is motivated through reclamation and salvation rather than personal gain? Or is the very fact that he is committing such an elaborate plan an act of folly he knows will never materialize because that is the nature of plans? I love that the film leaves you, the viewer, to determine whether this assertion is optimistic or pessimistic and how that paints the film's message.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, the movie is another showcase of how Bong Joon-ho is brilliant at visually communicating his wonderful stories. The editing is so tightly precise to maximize tension and comedy, and sometimes both simultaneously. The photography is gorgeously composed with the use of space in the frame excellently communicating character relationships. The geography of the home is nicely utilized to ratchet up the tension of escaping around corners and hiding around furniture. There are moments that just made me want to applaud the filmmakers for their top-level craft.\n\nParasite is an effortlessly impressive movie that blends tones, insights, and entertainment to create one of the more unique and pleasing film experiences of the year. Bong Joon-ho once again shown himself to be a masterclass filmmaker who can tackle just about any subject and any genre and make it sing. I'd advise to avoid specific spoilers to maintain the surprise factor; however, this movie is so well executed, so astonishingly developed with precision and attention given to each of the characters and their individual whims and problems, that even knowing every single plot beat in this movie will not diminish the enjoyment factor. That's because Parasite is a rare movie that is so sumptuously put together, so seamlessly calibrated, that to watch the movie is to simply sit in awe of how talented the filmmakers are at weaving their tale. Parasite is definitely one of the best films of 2019 and worth tracking down where able.\n\nNate's Grade: A",
