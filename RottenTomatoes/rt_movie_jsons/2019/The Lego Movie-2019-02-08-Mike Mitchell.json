With more musical numbers and the same remarkable animation, it's a decent companion piece that expands on the main characters. This time, the theme is why infantilism isn't so bad if you're content with your LEGO set. Even if you assume that the LEGO Company does not want anyone to grow up and stop buying their products, it is still a unique moral that can apply to anything, including something like the Funko Pop collection or any other childhood memorabilia. As the film cleverly illustrates, hiding your true feelings and interests behind a false mask of maturity does not make you an adult. What really puts this movie above and beyond its predecessors is the same top-quality humor. It's a mix of meta jokes and quips that somehow manage to not be agonizingly bad; not everything works, but what does most certainly can make you snigger.",

They also introduce a lot of really neat character concepts such as Rex and Queen Watevra Wa'Nabi.

Just a little bit more adult-oriented humor than in Batman, but not as good an overall story.

            "content": "Might have an unpopular opinion here, but in terms of personal enjoyment I probably liked The Lego Movie 2 just as much as the first one. True, the original is always going to be hard to top as it was fresh back in the day and we've had Lego Batman and Lego Ninjago since then, but in terms of being a proper sequel, it definitely was better than I was expecting it to be an average sequel.\n\nThe story follows right after the original, with Emmet and the others facing a new threat of invaders to their society and having to stop them. During their mission they encounter new characters and locations and many twists and turns along the way. There's a few sequences that replicate the original in parts, but some new stuff I wasn't expecting too such as musical numbers and unexpected subversions. As usual, the Animation quality is top notch, although some might argue the Lego movements feel a bit less Lego-ish, but it didn't bother me.\n\nThe humour and style of the film is very similar to the original. I found myself liking alot of the jokes, although I wouldn't say they worked every single time, you could tell Phil Lord and Chris Miller wrote the script. I will say however that you definitely need to have seen the first one to get the most out of this movie. The songs in this movie I thought were pretty decent. It was never going to top \"Everything is Awesome\" and yeah they do reuse it, but the other songs they added I didn't feel were completely pointless.\n\nOverall, The Lego Movie 2 ended up being better than I was expecting it to be. It's always going to be hard to top the original and yeah it doesn't feel as fresh and they do reuse some ideas, themes, and jokes in it, but as an Animated sequel I think it delivers on giving us a movie in the same ball park that works both for kids and adults. Would I like to see another sequel? I don't know, but if Phil Lord and Chris Miller are involved again, I'll be happy to see another.",

Not until the movie has nearly ended does it come together and did I feel somewhat entertained.\nThe jokes aren't clever enough to keep your attention, except for maybe 2, and the songs feel unnecessary. The one that claims it'll get stuck in your head was ironically not that catchy, while those performed by the villain were the most fun. The previous movie's \"Everything is Awesome\" is painfully overused in the form of renditions and quotes. I think the sad version should've been the only reference, and the record album Emmet was gifted an Easter egg.\n\nThe twist was a lazy attempt at making the villains misunderstood, it didn't add up, but the worst offender was the Rex character. I must've missed some dialogue, because I have no idea why he's so Hell-bent on making Emmet become like him and thus ensuring his own suffering.

I enjoyed seeing the characters sound like the brother and sister in the real world, but unfortunately, that only lasts for about 5 minutes. The plot is enjoyable and the movie throughout is consistently funny. A pretty predictable plot twist still comes with a good payoff. All of the favorite characters from the first are great in this as well. The first one had that song we all know now, but it was not that annoying to me. This one, however, was very annoying. Way overdone which you could argue that they were purposely trying to do that. Still, it came off in a bad way to me. Still, a good watch and the visuals alone are enough to keep you intrigued. Grade: 85% (B)",

The only problem that this movie faces is that at some points the movie gets annoying, and not in a good way. Everything else makes this a good Lego Movie sequel. So 7/10, I think the cracks are showing, but at least they are not fully shown.",

The hyper energetic, rapid fire, excessively quirky, reference laden style of writers Chris Miller and Phil Lord is still brilliant as ever, after one or two more films it will start to get a bit stale. In this sequel, the humor is not as distinctively original as it was in the first film but that doesn't diminish how funny it is, we've just seen it before and know what to expect. Along those same lines, the huge metaphor of the whole film is really obvious in this one and is not quite as hidden as it was in the first(it was pretty obvious there to).The metaphorical reality of the plot is still effective here if not quite as graceful as the first. The animation is still as sublime as the first and might be the one thing that is slightly better than the previous film as there seems to be a greater variety in the visuals. The entire returning cast is still dynamite. Chris Pratt brings out his Kurt Russel impression to play another main character and steals the show from himself. Will Arnett is still the funniest thing to happen to batman since Joel Schumacher( but here it is funny in a good way). The higher quantity of songs in this one worked surprisingly well with some of the best jokes being delivered musically. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Overall: Using the same blueprints as the first film, this sequel isn't built quite as strong but still delivers a comedic knockout thanks to a surefire cast, sharp writing and a terrific sense of playtime enjoyment. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Highlight: I don't mean to make the whole film sound awful, but the CREDITS were awesome!!!",

The musical numbers a great again and they manage to finish the film on a very strong note. The core reason this film failed to ignite the box office was fatigue. They allowed two spin-off films to push ahead of this film. The film didn't have the same strength of the first, and entering a market with strong competition wasn't ideal.

Cutting to five years later Bricksburg has become Apocalypseburg. The Lego team from the first movie are under attack by the Duplo invaders. Emmet (Chris Pratt) is his usual upbeat self, but everyone else has a much darker tone to them. Lucy (Elizabeth Banks) wishes that Emmet would grow up a bit and change, but Emmet doesn't understand this. One day the Lego are attacked by General Mayhem (Stephanie Beatriz) who brings Lucy, Unikitty (Alison Brie), MetalBeard (Nick Offerman), Benny (Charlie Day) and Batman (Will Arnett) to her Queen in order for a ceremony to happen. Emmet is left behind and decides to change by moving forward and saving his friends. Meanwhile the other Lego meet Queen Watevra Wa'Nabi (Tiffany Haddish) who says she isn't evil, but Lucy isn't quite sure about that. Emmet travels to the Queens dimension, but during the process meets a mysterious adventurer named Rex Dangervest (Chris Pratt) who isn't who he appears at first. The movie has it's moments and has some great animation, but it just doesn't have the feel of the first film. I really enjoyed the first film, but this movie misses the mark on a few spots. The overall theme in this is about sharing as the toys represent something happening in the real world (just like the first movie). This time around Finn (Jadon Sand) and his sister Bianca (Brooklyn Prince) are arguing about playing with their Lego. The first movie had a better premise I think and the addition of Will Ferrell in that movie helped out a lot. He's still around in this one, but just his voice which is a bummer. The film itself underperformed at the box office, so Warner Bros let their license with Lego expire, so this is probably the last we'll see of these specific characters. With Universal picking up the rights I hope they do more original stuff going forward!",

            "content": "The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part is the fourth LEGO animated movie by Warner Bros. Animation.  Five years have passed since Emmet and his friends first saved the world from \"Taco Tuesday\" and the now called \"Apocalyseburg\" is where they have been forced to live due the frequent attacks by DUPLO and LEGO rip-offs.  Lucy and the rest of Emmet's friends then get kidnapped by these non LEGOs and are taken to the \"Systar System\".  Emmet then sets out to rescue his beloved friends and bring them back home safely.  \nFor the most part this film was engaging, funny and overall enjoyable to watch.  As an older viewer I didn't go into this film with much confidence as I just saw it as an easy cash grab directed at kids but came out pleasantly surprised.  Viewers were bombarded with pop culture references (in a good way) throughout the entirety of the film.  This was to keep the older viewers engaged and laughing and was something I enjoyed thoroughly.  \nThis movie was obviously meant for kids but the humour throughout was at a much higher, wittier standard than most recent family films.  At no point did I find myself cringing or wanting to rip my eyes out like I have in the past.  Instead I genuinely smiled and even laughed at various points throughout.  \nWhat irritated me the most was the overuse of musical numbers in this movie.  With the success of the previous film's songs the creators must have thought that they'd mimic their past triumphs by harassing audiences with countless songs.  Whilst some were enjoyable and fun (like the song used for the credits) some were just irritating and carried on for a tedious amount of time.  These songs didn't add to the story but instead drew me away and reminded me that I was watching a kid's movie. \nA substantial amount of these songs were just different versions of \"Everything is Awesome\" which is lazy and exceedingly boring.  They should have just left it at one or two references to this song instead of a bucket load.\nWarner Bros. Animation studios created an exquisite and brilliant look to this film.  The animation was so crisp and didn't have any blunders making it easy on the eyes.  The characters moved so naturally and all the voices were timed with extreme care.  \nI appreciated this and the first film equally as both were engaging for all demographics and were filled with funny gags and references.  Although there were a couple of unneeded songs this film overall was enjoyable.  \nThe Lego Movie 2: The Second Part is like the class clown in a primary school classroom.  It's enjoyable for the most part and makes you laugh but also makes the same joke too much making you sick of that one particular thing.",

This film expertly portrayed a brother and sister. While I miss old characters like Liam Neeson's Bad Cop, new characters and the ones kept from the first film are colorful and likable. Also, there are many song numbers in this film that I think easily surpass Frozen 2's soundtrack for their humor, melodies, and overall incredible production value.

When Ethan's friends are abducted by aliens he partners up with a rogue adventure seeker named Rex to rescue them.  The writing is especially good and takes the series in an interesting direction.  And it delivers a positive message, addressing some important issues in a lighthearted and entertaining way.  Additionally, the humor is really well-done and delivers a lot of laughs.  Also, the musical numbers are extremely energetic with a rich, colorful visual style, and the songs are very catchy (especially \"Catchy Song\").  A worthy successor to the original, The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part delivers a hilarious adventure that all ages can enjoy.",

Anyways, this one really surprised me. It tries too hard to be Sweet Mayhem like the first one, but it sometimes ended up being General Mayhem. The humour is juvenile for the most part like Ninjago, and it actually lost me for some time for how incoherent and all over the place the plot is. That said, it delivered its message surprisingly brilliantly by taking advantage of its twists and turns in a way that made my jaw drop! Also, its second half largely compensated for the issues I have with its first hour, as it kept getting better after that at everything. Hence, everything became AWESOME again!\n\n(8/10)",

The animation is still brilliant, it's still hilarious (with a ton of jokes and references that kids won't get!), it still has heart, and it still has great songs!

It's not quite as good, natch, but it maintains that crazy sense that the filmmakers are just doing what they want and if they think of a funny enough idea (Twilight-referencing day spa, cameos from John McClane and former Seattle Supersonics point guard Gary Payton, song about romantically preferring Superman to Batman etc) they'll just put it in. The \u2018real life' stuff, the big reason why the first film wasn't just hilarious but heartfelt in a way you just weren't expecting, has lost the element of surprise, and is generally signposted a lot more than in the first, which is a shame because the general message it has is just as touching as number 1. Also, time travel makes its way ungainly in the direction of the movie, which always irks me because there's so many plot holes and logic jumps that my brain can't help but notice (and I always try to not notice). Making a film that is so funny, inventive and entertaining and that would (I assume) truly appeal to all ages must be incredibly difficult, considering how few of them there are. That this achieves it is testament to the creative teams behind it, and to their wielding of silliness like a katana. May more films lean on silliness in the future. Also, in the time since I saw the film, the Lonely Island/Beck/Robyn song from the end credits has rarely left my head.",

Just because your intention is to sell a product doesn't mean you can't have cutting commentary or take the piss out of what you are selling. Subsequent entries have not let me down. The Lego Batman movie was damn good, the Lego Ninjago outing was a decent rental movie, and this picture manages to follow up on the themes of the original and expand on them, albeit in a more predictable manner. We still get plenty of sharp writing from Phil Lord and Chris Miller; Chris Pratt, Will Arnett, and Elizabeth Banks are great as you'd expect; and the visuals, set pieces, soundtrack, and plethora of fun licensed material may encourage viewers to open up a crate of LEGO's and have at it. And the message is kind of interesting. If the original was about a father who really needed to loosen up, this movie is about his son needing to do the same. It's one of those rare modern CGI-filled kids pictures that has about as much to say to the parent as it does juvenile audiences. It's not perfect but it didn't need to be. An easy choice to entertain you and your family on a lazy Sunday afternoon.     ",

If this was where the franchise had started, I'd say it was better than expected for LEGO, but still not great if I'm being totally honest.  It falls into a lot of that sequel fatigue of the same, but not as good.  They explore different worlds, but only a couple, and they aren't as crazy or interesting as the first one.  There's more about the connection between the Lego world and the human world, but after the mindf*** ending of the first this time it just doesn't feel as organic.  Yeah there's a nice bit about sibling relationships, but overall the human element just comes out a little weird this time around and raises some bizarre questions.  The biggest downer though is the comedy, in that it's just not as funny.  The first Lego movie was outright hilarious.  This one, at best, is chuckle-worthy.  There were 2 or 3 decent laughs, but for the most part it just got small smiles out of me.  Having said that, it's still charming and the animation is still absolutely gorgeous.

If this was where the franchise had started, I'd say it was better than expected for LEGO, but still not great if I'm being totally honest.  It falls into a lot of that sequel fatigue of the same, but not as good.  They explore different worlds, but only a couple, and they aren't as crazy or interesting as the first one.  There's more about the connection between the Lego world and the human world, but after the mindf*** ending of the first this time it just doesn't feel as organic.  Yeah there's a nice bit about sibling relationships, but overall the human element just comes out a little weird this time around and raises some bizarre questions.  The biggest downer though is the comedy, in that it's just not as funny.  The first Lego movie was outright hilarious.  This one, at best, is chuckle-worthy.  There were 2 or 3 decent laughs, but for the most part it just got small smiles out of me.  Having said that, it's still charming and the animation is still absolutely gorgeous.  The characters are all likeable, new and old, and kids will definitely love it.  It's a shame that it's such a massive step down from the first one, but with the bar set so high even a step down is still a decent movie.",

        {
            "content": "The movie started off great. I loved the beginning and the aliens taking over and Apocalypse-burg. But how the story concluded itself ruined the whole thing for me.\n\nThrough-out the movie you get the perception the aliens are the bad guys, or at least their leader is. They come and devastate and destroy the Lego world, which leads to it becoming a waste-land. The regular Legos just can't beat the aliens. A group of brave superheros go into space to find the alien world and never return.\n\nThen the aliens kidnap a group of 'representatives' from the Lego world. Emmett is not in the group, so he decides to build a spaceship and travel into space alone. Meanwhile the kidnapped group meets the queen of the aliens. She sings a song about soooo not being evil while all the while bribing members of the group. She wants to hold a marriage ceremony at the space-temple when the stars align, which is feared will bring Armomageddan. Wild Style is the only one who refuses to be bribed.\n\nEmmett meets a cool companion who is also after the aliens, so they team up. They stumble into a world of cookie-cutter houses called lala sparkle something land, which his new friend says is dangerous. Emmett sees Superman mowing the lawn. He goes over to ask him why they never came back, and sees him and Green Lantern being buddies. (Also Wonder-woman shows up at some point.) He asks them the question, and they say they like it 'here' and never want to leave. Then all the sudden everyone in this town creepily says 'let's show him the music.' They start creepily singing 'LaLa' over and over and act like zombies moving as one trying to get Emmett. Emmett's travel partner tells him not to listen to the music, and so they cover their ears and run, (I would too!).\n\nWild-Style, Unikitty, Batman, space-ship guy, and one other person, (I believe), are taken to another weird planet. They are put in a room with brain-washing music. Everyone gives into the music except Lucy, (wild-style), who escapes through the vents.\n\nLucy and Emmett find each-other. Rex, (I finally remember his name!), says he doesn't trust Lucy and she might be brainwashed, but Emmett convinces him to let her help with their plan. They're going to attack the ceremony from multiple angles, stealing a device that protects the temple and doing a super-punch at the top to destroy it.\n\nAfter that Queen Whateverwannabe gets batman to agree to marry her using his jealousy of Superman, (what a great thing to found a relationship on!). The wedding ceremony begins.\n\nLucy is making headway on stealing the device when the queen's general comes in. They have an epic battle. The general is flown over the edge and their helmet flies off, and it's discovered the general is a cute fairy princess??? Lucy gives into her emotional side and helps her up.\n\nThe general explains it all this way: Well, you got mad at us when one of us ate the heart made for us and attacked so we attacked you back. Then we decided we'd try a last attempt at peace, so this whole thing was just a misunderstanding.\n\nLong story short the real bad guy turns out to be Rex. Now this ruins EVERYTHING for me. I'll go over why point by point.\n\n1) First of all, there's a planet on which aliens are gathering bricks. They're forced to gather bricks and labor for the queen before a certain time, so is this FOR authoritarian rule and forced labor?\n\n2) The queen sings a song about her not being evil, which really makes her look evil. In this song she offers bribes, now why would someone need to offer bribes to get what they want if they were good and just misunderstood? Is this teaching kids that good people offer bribes or that it's good to offer bribes? Also, her using of jealousy to get Batman to want to marry her is unbecoming of a queen, or indeed any leader.\n\n3) The brain-washing music turns out to just be catchy music in the end. This is a message of, 'Go with the flow, no music is bad for you!' Also it doesn't even make sense with the way characters are effected by it in the movie. You want me to believe the toys in LaLa land were just singing a catchy tune? Watch that clip and I'm sure you'll disagree.\n\n4) It teaches kids and people in general that, 'everyone's just misunderstood.' Say that when faced with China, Russia, or North Korea! 'I'm SURE if we just understood Kim he wouldn't blow us up with nuclear missiles, let's just get rid of ours.' Not a good idea. The world isn't just full of mis-understood people, there is such a thing as evil in the world. Ever tried to reason with a bully? A dictator? What about Hitler? You don't just murder millions of Jews cause you had a bad life, (though he certainly had one, I've had one too, we all get dealt bad cards, but that shouldn't be used as an excuse for the bad things we do). Yes, people can change, and yes circumstances can effect character, but evil people are out there, and teaching our kids otherwise is detrimental.\n\n5) The inconsistency of the plot. Based on the above points, (specifically 2 and 3) the story itself is just inconsistent. It's just too far of a turn-around to be believe-able. Yes, bad characters can turn out to be understandable characters, but a good writer has them and the story recognize what they did do wrong. Usually they're sorry for such things and there is a back-story given for WHY they did the things they did, but none of that is present here. The bad actions are simply labeled misunderstandings, and the queen is branded as a good character despite not changing one bit.\n\n6) The following are moral objections based on my personal Christian beliefs. This is to warn others that these things are in the movie. First of all the temple and stars aligning and stuff. We are given no explanation why this needs to happen in the movie. It would make sense had it summoned Armomageddan, but in the movie it simply seems to be an aesthetic choice, such a characterization can confuse a human mind about it's use it real life, which usually has to do with witch-craft of some sort, so therefore it can call such a thing good or at least neutral. Also, the only words from the bible spoken in the entire movie are spoken out of context by the bad guy, so if you were on a review sight and saw that there was a bible verse spoken, (as we had before seeing the movie), don't necessarily think it's a good movie because of that.\n\nI could go on, but these are my main objections. Thank you to anyone who read my super-long opinionated review :).",

Why isn't she a normal lego figure like everyone else and why is she just made out of lego bricks that can transform into other shapes and objects? I think this movie would be much better if Queen Whatevera and her team were actually bad just trying to be friends. Also, why do they add real people in the movie fighting with their legos. In lego movies you're trying to prove legos are actually real to little kids and this proves their fake. And when Emit goes under the washer?? Just why?? That's just weird.

            "content": "Almost everything is awesome about this sequel. Whether you will like this film or not, depends on what kind of movie you are looking for. If you are expecting this one to be just as story driven as the first one, you will be disappointed. But if you're looking for a movie to laugh at, and have meta-references (both at the expense of the movie and the actors in the movie, like in \"Teen Titans Go\" last year) than you will thoroughly enjoy this film. Not all of the jokes worked, but the ones that did, really landed. The film also had some catchy musical numbers that I was humming the rest of the day. One problem with the film was the inconsistency of the world's rules. It's established early on that this is all happening in the minds of two children, but later in the film, the Lego figures are shown to be sentient. I haven't seen a movie so inconsistent with its rules since 2017's \"Boss Baby.\" I was worried from the trailer that this was going to be SJW male shaming (\"So you fought and did all the cool stuff, but the hapless male was still the leader?\"), but except for that one line (which I rolled my eyes way back into my head at) it wasn't. If anything, it's calling out Hollywood on the unrealistic body portrayals of action stars in films (i.e. Chris Pratt's other roles, but it's all in good fun), which is somewhat ironic since all Legos have the same body type. But the film did say how movies telling young males the \"ideal, cool\" way to be is just as harmful as when it happens to young females. Even though the story isn't as strong this time around, it's still hilarious and is definitely worth seeing, if only for the jokes and meta-references. ",

And by the looks of it, I was right. But you have to remember, this is a sequel and though its still Phil Lord and Chris Miller's screenplay, they aren't directing this one even though their influence is still felt. Given The Lego Movie 2's bad marketing campaign and Lego fatigue seeing how we had 2 spin-off movies back in 2017 leading to a poor box office performance by Lego standards, though not an outright bomb, I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did. The animation is gorgeous with a glorious return to the toy-based aesthetic and some absolutely amazing visuals, we get to see a great dual role from Chris Pratt showing that voice acting isn't just \"read these lines in your comfortable booth and sound angry for this one and sad for that one\", the humour never lets down - why are the jokes that were spoken in the trailer less cringy in the final cut of the movie? -, the action sequences show just how liberating animation is, the unexpected musical numbers are surprisingly good and the heart. Say what you want about Legos being childish but the heart is universal. I...probably could've done better structuring of that sentence. With its witty script, fun visuals, welcome new additions (careful: there might be a plot twist or two) and catchy songs, everything about The Lego Movie 2 is...slightly less awesome.",

            "content": "And we're back following on from the first hit movie based on the popular childhood toy Lego.\n\nThe movie continues from where it left off at the conclusion of the first movie. After discovering the Lego universe was in fact the concoction of Finn's imagination whilst playing, his little sister Bianca comes along to join in on the fun. Within the Lego world this is represented by the arrival of Duplo built aliens. The aliens quickly destroy Bricksburg reducing it to an apocalyptic wreck. In the real world this translates to Bianca taking some Lego down to the basement to play with in order to get away from Finn.\n\nThe adventure that follows revolves around a few of the main characters (Batman, Lucy, Benny, and Unikitty) getting kidnapped by an unknown force and taken to the Systar System. There Queen Watevra Wa'Nabi wants to marry Batman and seemingly keep the others in a state of happiness and temptation. It's up to Emmet to try and save his friends with the help of a new found friend in Rex Dangervest.\n\nSo I guess the most interesting part of this movie is the way they represent the real world through the actions of the Lego world, and vice versa. Obviously we all know this from the first movie but that element becomes a much stronger feature from the midway part of this movie. Basically we find out that certain places in the Lego world are actually jumbled wording for things in reality like the washer dryer and the area beneath it, or the basement, or the kid's mother (which turns out to be a vision of armageddon for the Lego world). Whilst I did kinda like this aspect of the story (in a kind of [i]Rugrats[/i] sort of way), I didn't really like how the real world becomes a much larger part of the overall story.\n\nBy that I mean this movie is supposed to be about a fantasy world of Lego primarily. OK it's based around a kids imagination but that's OK if used sparingly. But they use this far too much towards the end and you just lose all sense of the Lego fantasy because the real world just takes you out of it (or did for me anyway). It's like the first half is a Lego fantasy flick whilst the second half actually becomes more like [i]Toy Story[/i] but with Lego (and not CGI animation). Now this is a good idea...but for another movie! This feels like two ideas crashing into each other and one wipes the other out.\n\nAnd that leads me to the movie as a whole, its one huge big giant mess. The original movie had a lot set within the Lego city of Bricksburg which was fine. There were also many other crazy elements tossed in there from lots of other franchises, which was fine. But in this sequel its exactly the same shit but like loaded up on cocaine. Its the most bat-shit crazy hodgepodge of ideas I've seen for some time. They throw literally everything they can think of at the wall to see what sticks, and frankly, it's so off the wall nuts not much of it does. The humour falls flat all the time, the ideas are all old hat (been there done that from the first movie), and the story is wafer thin.\n\nBottom line it's all about Finn and Bianca coming together, stopping their squabbling and playing friendly. That is literally it, the whole plot about certain characters getting kidnapped just feels like a waste of time. Yeah it all represents the two kids feuding and eventually reuniting but its hella weak. The point where their mother gets fed up and tells them to pack all their Lego away is just odd because what parent would tell their kids to box up all their toys and put them in storage as a punishment?? Yeah the parent might confiscate the toys for a while but box it up for storage? It's also that boxing that represents the armageddon in the Lego world.\n\nDon't get me wrong the movie is visually very impressive as you would expect and seeing the various Lego pieces is always a nostalgic joy. But at the end of the day this [b]really[/b] feels like they had no real idea where to go with the story and just chucked a load of random things into the blender. The movie is itself much like a young child's Lego creation, a colourful unusual hybrid of anything and everything stuck together. Obviously that is the basic idea but I really feel this just ran out of steam about five minutes in. Seeing the [i]Mad Max[/i] inspired post-apocalyptic Bricksburg was cool, after that its essentially exactly the same as before but duller and more bizarre.\n\nNot even a Lego version of Chris Pratt sending up all his previous movie characters by rolling them into one character could save this I'm afraid. Yes, even that brazen rugged good-looking type action hero character has been done to death both comically and seriously.\n\n4/10",

Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the writers, are two guys who absolutely get the witty stuff that this movie does so well. The voice acting of Chris Pratt (Emmet Brickowski/Rex Dangervest) is one again top notch, as is the work of Elizabeth Banks (Lucy), Will Arnett (Batman), Charlie Day (Benny) and basically everyone involved. I got a kick out of Jason Momoa (Aquaman) playing his popular DC character. I think the story works well. It does a good job making sure that the main characters grow and the use of the rivalry between siblings was a cool route to take.\n\nWeaknesses: Something about this movie just feels off at points. Like, it technically does everything similar to the original, but lacks what made that one special. It's missing some of the funny and charming factors from the first film. While I appreciated the idea of the real world scenes, there are probably too many late and it bogs down the overall story we came to see. Was not a fan of Tiffany Haddish (Queen Watevra Wa'Nabi) in this. The voice work felt over the top and kind of like her character in a lot of other stuff I've seen her in, rather than something unique to the role.\n\nOverall: Though it misses the mark in terms of being as special as the original, there's still enough to make this a recommendable movie. It's a good time.",

But if it should make sense in this explicit case, the real life boy should have time traveled to. There is a new Charakter, a creature who can turn it whatever it wants and it has the voice of an annoying black woman. Even though the kid who plays the legos is white. This movie isn't consistent at all with the story and things happen in the LEGO world which couldn't have been played in real life. Even with much fantasy. It's like the producers wanted a second movie and tried to write a movie as fast as possible and without a could story. The message of the movie is cute, but mediated very poorly.

            "content": "There are few movies that I adore as much as the original LEGO movie (I gave it 100%!), so the sequel was doomed to disappoint me. Even so, I was not expecting to be THIS disappointed. The Second Part is lacking in the delightful cleverness and originality of the First Part, which I guess could not be avoided - it's all part and parcel of being a sequel - but this one really pales in comparison. It's cute and all, but the story is slow, the animation is not nearly as stunning and, worst of all, it's boring. The movie starts exactly where the first film left off - with the town of Bricksburg being invaded by an alien race of Duplos. At first, the Duplos are pretty funny as they wreak havoc on the poor LEGO citizens like literal drunken toddlers, but the movie quickly drifts away from this storyline to focus on what feels like very forced family-friendly though oddly unrelated messages: namely, don't try to be a tough-guy, and also get along with your siblings. The first film was genius in its massive appeal to both kids and adults (often for different reasons), but this one left me confused - I couldn't figure out who its target audience was supposed to be. It's chock full of nudge-nudge-wink-wink jokes and pop-culture references that are clearly meant for the grown folk, but also includes a bunch of kiddie-friendly musical numbers (Musical numbers! What are musical numbers doing in a LEGO movie??? This is not Disney, nobody came for that shit!). Ultimately, I think neither group will be impressed. The movie is clever at times and does have funny moments that made me chuckle, particularly with its use of witty word plays (my personal favorite is Queen Watevra Wa'Nabe, get it?); but a great many of the jokes don't find their mark and just aren't very funny. The story tries to make up for its lack of originality and humor by packing in the meta references, but it's a little too much for its own good. Seriously, there is a character who is quite literally an amalgamation of all of Chris Pratt's action-hero characters. It's too on-the-nose to be clever. The whole movie is suffocated by a weak plot and humor that feels forced and often a little desperate. I really wanted to love it but left the theater profoundly underwhelmed. Sadly, everything is decidedly not so awesome this time around. #EverythingIsNotAwesome",

As exuasted of Tiffany Haddish as I am getting, she makes Queen Wateva-wanabi a fun and interesting antagonist.

The sequel contains much of what made it so much fun, but unfortunately suffers somewhat from the law of diminishing returns. It's still funny, emotionally-driven and full of fantastic characters, old and new, but there's a much more scattershot plot this time round. While the first one started out strong, this one takes a while to get into its groove, though I really liked how it started at the exact point the original ended, creating a perfect continuity. The voice cast are as likeable as ever, and their enthusiasm and sense of timing bring their characters to life. Batman, as he did previously, gets many of the best lines, but Pratt, Banks and newcomer Haddish all have their own chances to shine. It's wise not to make too many references to its predecessors, and while it does still have a heartfelt message, it's a different one to the first, and is now about the bond between siblings. I would rank it behind both Lego Movie and Lego Batman, but since those are incredibly high watermarks, falling just behind them is nothing to be ashamed of. I loved its jokes, its characters and the mind-twisting world its pulls you into. See The Lego Movie 2 as soon as you can.",

            "content": "Five years after defeating the evil Lord Business and ensuring imagination and innovation survived in their Lego-home, nice guy Emmet (Chris Pratt) and warrior Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) have been leading the fight for survival against the destructive Lego Duplo invaders. Written and produced by the original film's creators Phil Lord and Chris Miller, incoming director Mike Mitchell delivers another peppy, sardonic and amusing escapade that places pop culture front and centre, this time expanding into the apocalyptic and outerspace sub-genres. The tongue-in-cheek meta-humour is again layered to appeal to all ages, encompassing everything from slapstick gags and Dad-jokes to satirical social commentary and cinematic homages only adults would understand. It doubles down on its comically catchy-song gag with another ludicrously absurd toe-tapper (the aptly named 'Catchy Song') that'll undoubtedly find its way into every household with a young kid, although the superbly on-the-nose 'Not Evil' performed by Tiffany Haddish's Queen Watevra Wa'Nabi is the highlight. Where this sequel loses its edge compared to its predecessor is on two fronts: the Lego-building action and the narrative structure. And it's not just because the surprise factor is now missing. There are still car chases, explosions and gunfights on display, but the 'master building' inventiveness has decreased in favour of more standard action beats. The finale also breaks the film's own logic, which feels like a bit of a cheat. The plot twist in the first instalment is developed further here, with true-to-life parallels driving the Lego-verse story; however, the moral lessons have become even more unsubtle thanks to unnecessary flashes of the real world throughout the runtime. It finishes on a joyfully silly high though, the end credits rap commenting on, well, end credits. I'm guessing Chris Cunnington is the first stereoscopic supervisor to be mentioned in a song. Ever. Suffering from diminishing returns for sure, there's still more than enough laugh-out-loud humour and clever references to make The Lego Movie 2 a crowd-pleasing adventure.",

This movie is funny, super cool, and awesome. One of the main reasons why it stands out is because of the plot twist that Rex Dangervest is actually Emmet. That was completly unexpected for me.

That is not necessarily a bad thing and its kind of understandable but it was a little annoying. Lastly, all of these twist endings are getting old, peolpe really need to think of something different. There were other things like an excessive amount of live action, but that is not as frustrating. The only redeeming quality was the ending, but I am not gonna get into that.",

The story itself is very OK at best with a plot twist you can decipher on the trailers alone, nothing new and exciting. The supporting characters has been tone down in participation, the soundtrack is bland, sound effects a visual design is all lego quality.

My favorite part of this movie is the references. There are SO MANY references, and nearly all of them are extremely funny and culturally relevant. There's a point where a Lego character says, \"I finally understand Radiohead\" and I nearly spit out what I had in my mouth because it was funny and unexpected. What differentiates this movie from the first one is that there are a lot more references toward the real world, and that detracts from the story at the end. It was a nice message and earlier in the movie the plot moved along pretty well, but the execution at the end was stereotypical and lazy. The movie definitely has an awesome soundtrack! While there were missteps at the end, I would certainly recommend this movie as it is hilarious most of the way through, and all ages will enjoy it!",

It's not quite as fresh and clever as the first go-round but it manages to better its predecessor in some key ways. Now that we know the colorful and zany antics of the animated Lego characters are also simultaneously the imaginative play of a real-world family, it provides a deeper thematic subtext with the unseen nature of siblings in conflict. I remember my own younger sister wanting to play with me and my toys, and me rebuffing her, and the film struck home some key emotional points about the inclusion of cooperative play. The different styles of play are on display as our characters are abducted by a shape-shifting space queen (voiced by Tiffany Haddish) who is determined to marry Batman and possibly rule the universe. A fantastic running joke is how transparently malevolent the queen is, which leads to an even better payoff. There are more songs and each is pretty well constructed, relevant to the story, and assuredly catchy, like \"Catchy Song\" used to brainwash people through pop, and a mournful version of \"Everything's Not Awesome\" that becomes genuinely inspirational and uplifting by its climax. The life lessons are easily digestible and the sense of breezy fun is still alive and well. I was laughing throughout, sometimes quite hard, and the brother/sister subtext had me wondering if I owed my younger sister a decades-late apology for my behavior (sorry, Natalie). Lego Movie 2 is a worthy sequel that finds new and interesting ways to build off the irreverent original's model. Bring on the Toy Story 3-style ending where our grown-up owner says goodbye to his childhood toys and friends. At this point, Lord and Miller can do anything and imbue it with wild wit, whimsy, and unparalleled mass entertainment (except Star Wars, I suppose).\n\nNate's Grade: B+",

This film was still hilarious and had some utterly impressive and beautiful set pieces, lots of movie references and a fairly original storyline.

The action is also centered upon the kid from the last movie and his sister battles for HOW to play (reminded me of my fights with my brother and sister and how each made our own small worlds with our Lego pieces). I can go on but then I would be spoiling more things from the film but have your eyes prepared for Easter Eggs and your ears for the catchy songs taht will stick on your-------. Happy movie going.",

            "content": "This movie had a more mature feel to it but still capturing the childlike wonderment and fun that legos bring. The first lego movie had the song that everyone hates to say that they love. This movie did not disappoint on the music. They took a take on a more musical theme to the movie which helped balance out the fact that it was more mature themed. The songs in it took the song from the first one and expanded on it. The sister is introduced at the end of the first one so you knew that she would play a big roll in the newest one. The conflict of this movie is known from the start but they present the movie in a way that makes getting to the conflict an adventure. You get the fun of all of the old characters plus the introduction of new ones. This story really shines a new light on our main character Emmet. In the first movie he is shown as helpless even though he is the \"special\". He relies on the side characters to help him save the day. In this movie Emmet faces the inner battle of feeling like he needs to change who he is. Then he faces the reality that he is truly the only one that can save the whole lego universe and all of his friends. Throughout the movie you see him battling who he thought he should become to truly realizing what makes him special. One complaint about the movie is how little Will Ferrell is in it. In the first one he is a major part of the movie, in this one not so much. We get some fun commentary from him in the back round but it doesn't add up. As an older person who still loved to be attached to that part of his childhood through playing with legos, why did he all of a sudden give that up? This movie plays along with the four dimensional building of the lego world with our real life characters but not as much as the first one. In the first one they build things to help save the day, in this one it plays out more as a movie. We see little things being built here and there but it definitely isn't as much as in the first one, which takes a little bit away from what you expect to see in a movie like this.",

The LEGO movie 2 is the worst kind of bad in that it gets so close to being good, and then throws out all its narrative potential for a bad and kind of sadistic message. LEGO Movie 2 uses what I call \u201cLegend of Korra Morality\u201d in that it attacks an ideology by presenting a character with that ideology, and instead of showing the ideologies shortcomings, it shows that character doing bad things and then the audience is supposed to hate the ideology by associating it with the bad actions. The final message is pro passivity and anti masculinity in a subtle way. And anti growing up/maturity in a overt way. The villain literally quotes scripture about a time to put away childish things and it\u2019s played off as bad. Problem is it\u2019s so close to being good. There\u2019s a lot of setup for a message discussing the advantages/disadvantages and needs/risks of destruction and creation, aggression and passivity, and masculine and feminine traits. Instead it just goes \u201cfeminine\u2019s good. Masculine bad. Passive good. Aggressive bad. Change bad, consistency good.\u201d Either way it\u2019s a bad message. Balance in these things is far more healthy and true. Again, the animation, acting, plot, storytelling, characters, humor and music are all very very good. Better in a lot of ways. But the fact the film could have delivered a powerful and useful message but instead shoveled us SJW expletive is the worst. Literally every masculine character either becomes evil or not masculine at the end of the film. Yes, even Batman. Congratulations Movie. You ruined LEGO Batman \ud83d\ude20",

All of sudden there was musical theme which was kind of weird. I do like the character design and feeling for the future Emmit, I think that was the only part that was on track of what I expected of Lego movie 2, but everything else was a bbit out of story, even the other characters with 'new improved' lego style as well, it's kind of not really 'the lego movie' anymore, jumping to another theme. I was expecting something more fun and creative as well but the everything was awesome song got re-used again and not much new fun stuffs in this movie really.

            "content": "When I first saw The LEGO Movie five years ago, I thought it was brilliant and a huge game changer in the animation department. It was so new, smart, meta and witty. The LEGO Movie was a much-needed breath of fresh air, but I never found myself begging to see a sequel at all. I thought it was a lovely self-contained story and didn't really need a sequel... But now we got this, and I'm SO FREAKING GLAD it exists. As the movie began I thought to myself \u00e2Hmm, this is pretty good but definitely not as special and important as the first\u00e2?, then the film went full throttle and what we ended up getting is a worthy predecessor to the original that is just as good.\n\nThe first was about parenting and the split between generations - this one is about siblings and sharing. The film picks up right where the last one left off. It continues the story of the previous film perfectly. It expands and builds upon the incredible world introduced in the previous film. The film presents the audience with fascinating concepts and ideas that keep you thinking and feeling long after the credits roll. Phil Lord and Chris Miller are back with a script that is as witty as ever. The writing is absolutely phenomenal, it brings back the same meta humour we have come to love and expect from a Lord and Miller script, and I honestly believe this is there funniest film. These two are truly comedic geniuses. \n\nThe acting is solid, which is not surprising when you look at the calibre of actors/actresses: Chris Pratt, Elizabeth Banks, Will Arnett and Tiffany Haddish just to name a few. I mean, what a phenomenal voice cast. Also many small cameos from people no one was expecting.\n\nI was very surprised by the cinematography. The wide shots had amazing atmosphere and the action was shot very well. The animation is amazing! All vibrant colours, SO many little subtle details which I greatly appreciated.\n\nPersonally, I caught all of the references and I loved every single one. If you know me, you know I\u00e2(TM)m a huge comic book fan and love knowing about the production of upcoming films and such so when they made fun of the DECU and how their production is all over the place I absolutely loved it. I was crying with laughter throughout the film. I particularly liked one song that basically broken down what makes Batman, Batman. It references almost every movie incarnation of Batman and it was absolutely amazing. The credits were also one of the funniest credits I've ever seen, particularly because I always like to sit there and watch the credits, read the names and think over the movie I just saw. \n\nThe film appeals to both kids and adults. All the musical numbers and jokes are hilarious, no matter how old you are. The LEGO Movie 2 is a more than worthy sequel to an already amazing film, with clever, hilarious and meta-writing, a great direction and talented voice cast. I now find myself wanting more of these as long as Lord and Miller and the ones behind the script. I cannot wait to see this again once it comes out in late March.",

There's a sense that the story isn't really going anywhere in particular. But the second half of the movie is better, as things pick up and start moving more quickly. The humor is decent, but again it's lacking some of the novelty and just clever writing that's in the original. And the ending and central \"conflict\" as it were between the siblings feels very shoehorned into the story. But I enjoyed it, as did my family, so I can't complain too much. And the music is great again.",

The opening was - pretty much shown from the whole trailer - was an apocalyptic type Mad Max vibe. This animation felt like it was more heading towards short LEGO movie animations instead of very good stop motion theatrical release films. The plot was the last thing you would've never guessed. I worried that Rex and Emmet, although their bravery, was going to be the same and they're as well played by the same actor. But that plot twist changed everything. The Bruce Willis jokes made me laugh my ass off. And surprised to see that he plays himself. The Justice League reference was hilarious and Jason Momoa played Aquaman was surprising.\n\nRex was pretty much a combination of all of Chris Pratt's famous characters put into one. Star-Lord, Owen from Jurassic World, etcetera. The message was better than the first one. I can now see how this is sort of a toy commercial as the number of toys they are putting out based on this movie is ridiculous since the last films merchandise did so well. The film didn't have as much of the secondary characters in it. I have to say the protagonist who had the most to the story was: Emmet, Wildstyle, Batman, Unikitty, Benny, Metalbeard. In order to most used to least. All of the actors did as good as they did previously. If you're expecting to see Duplo versus LEGO, expect the unexpected. It rarely happens. They have many references and jokes spread out the film of a wide age range.\n\nPerhaps this should be the end of the LEGO movie universe. This financially is doing terribly since LEGO Ninjago and it isn't getting hype anymore. It feels quite repetitive. Although that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy this film. There was nothing wrong with it. The script wasn't as great as the first films. I did love it.",

            "content": "Over 5 years ago, The Lego Movie was built into theaters and became a critical and financial success with both adults and children alike. Now, since then we have had over 2 spinoff movies which were never as smart or mature as the first. The Lego Movie 2 continues them traits and creates a wickedly hilarious but hugely problematic follow up. However, I loved this movie far more than I thought I was going into it even though it isn't as mature, clever or sophisticated as the first and the screenplay feels uninspired when compared to its predecessor. It also isn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t as well directed and that's probably due to the fact that Chris Miller and Phil Lord didn't return to direct. Overall, it lacks substance and won't change the film genre like the original did but it is a flawed but fun adventure. \n\nNonetheless, the real key to a film directed strongly to kids is having relatable humour and this film will entertain the socks off of younger viewers. However, I found this movie to be extremely funny and every reference or joke lands and I found myself to be more intrigued with the film as it progressed because the humour would get a lot more consistent and cohesive towards the story and, eventually, appealed more to my age demographic. Ultimately, this feature wouldn't off worked without it's strong and persistent satire due to the fact that the absurdity and jokes swept me through the film, as well as it's surprisingly pleasurous songs. But towards the end there is a twist that has great ideals but is not executed that well and that's all down to how the script handles it. The twist isn't told visually, neither over a long period of time to let the viewer digest the info; instead the picture decides to throw it into a pile of exposition that lasts for far too long, where if you miss a little bit of info, the third act may result in confusion.\n\nLike most, after I had seen the Lego Movie back in 2014, I wanted a sequel due to how the movie ended. I was always disappointed when the studios brought out spinoffs instead of a direct sequel so now it's here, it feels underwhelming and that was because the opening failed to galvanize me. I was extremely daunted when the sequence was heavily rushed through and only lasted for about 3 minutes or so. After this, the film finishes of it's first act with a very bland and wearisome aftermath. Whilst Emmet and Batman yet again steal the show, loveable characters like Unikitty or President Business, that became fan-favourites, feel underutilized and their presence and role discern like cameos. But despite rushing through its opening, which had huge potential, and having a bland first 15 minutes, The Lego Movie 2 is a rollercoaster of a film once it's adventure begins. Even though it lacks the heart and originality of the first and isn't in the slightest as sophisticated or surprising, this movie does bring a dose of great twists, catchy songs, cleverly realistic scenarios, and jokes that make this movie one of the funniest film from recent years - flawed but fun.",

I got behind the plot far more naturally from the getogo--and I feel like everyone at SOME point has played with a little kid and experienced that \"you missed\" moment of frustration.\n\nSo overall, the things that annoyed me in the first film annoyed me less in this one, cute new characters, and just as funny and colorful as the original.",

            "content": "Lego. Oh what a wonderful set of toys it is. When the first LEGO movie came out, I was a bit in awe on how it was created. The creation and animation was just beautifully done and it provided hilarious cameos and humor. After it\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s success, we got the LEGO Batman movie. I enjoyed it so much more and as a whole, was stepped up a notch. I did not get the chance yet to see LEGO Ninjago, but that was because it did not initially appeal to me but after seeing this movie, I have a renewed interest to see it now. This film picks up where the first film left off with the live action sequences we were treated to at the end of the first film and it inter-cuts this into the main story. I have to say that I like how they make this universe work. Again, it\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s very creative. The LEGO world now looks like something out of Mad Max. Chris Pratt returns to do the lead voice of Emmet and Elizabeth Banks as the rebel without a cause, Lucy. Some of my favorite moments throughout the film are the Justice League cameos, especially Jason Mamoa doing the voice work for Aquaman. I loved the yell he does being added here. Another nice touch is a scene where Lucy is traveling through a vent and we see John McClane of Die Hard. Bruce Willis does the small bit of dialogue and thought it was hilarious. The villains this time around are \u00ef\u00bf 1/2Aliens\u00ef\u00bf 1/2\u00c2? from another LEGO world that want a marriage between their queen, voiced by the always funny, Tiffany Haddish. While the group captured falls into the gifts the queen wants to give, Lucy is not buying it. This leads to original music that I still can\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t get out of my head. The tunes are so catchy. Emmet in the meantime decides to travel to save the group and runs into Rex Dangervest. Halo video game lovers will love the suit he has on when we are first introduced to him. As the movie pedals along, we are treated to a few twists along with a meaningful ending. The third act kind of threw me for a loop at times and was actually surprised in the direction it ended up going in. The animation continues to be strong and all the voice actors add their own flavor to each character and I loved every moment that each LEGO had. Will Arnett\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s Batman again steals the show and I am not surprised. I will not though there is one joke in the film I thought was a little tasteless. Abraham Lincoln has a LEGO in the film and when he is about to fall into oblivion, he cracks a joke about having theater tickets. It seemed a bit morbid to me to throw a joke at a person\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s death. All in all, LEGO Batman still remains my favorite but this a very good sequel that is a worthy addition to the LEGO movie universe.",

A common thing in movies now today, dubbing down the original male lead is nothing new. We see this in Ant Man and The Wasp taking a character like Scott Lang and taking any of his criminal smarts and throwing it out the window. Stil though I enjoyed the movie. This is also seen in Wreck it Ralph 2 taking any common sense away from Ralph and making him a stupid character just to drive a main plot. Now, we see it in this film. At the end of the original, Emmet, though still a very quirky character, has found some kind of maturity. In the original, when his friends were in danger, he got the wit to get back up and return to his world to save them. But yet in this film, Emmet can\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)t figure out that the world is in peril and yeah, everything is not awesome. And yet when his friends are about to be abducted by an evil alien, he can\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)t put up the wit to do anything. Heck, When they are being chased by an evil villain he puts on a darn turn signal? What? He\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)s not that dumb. I mean come on. Not only that, but this plot is so convoluted, to the point where you don\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)t know really what\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)s going on. If anything, this movie has more confused us to what is actually in the LEGO world and when the kids are playing with them. Toward the end, these questions are raised, as well as a very confusing ending. At one point you think the movie is over, then it is not. Then, the movie should actually be over, but yet it is not. This film also falls under the category of more appealing to girls then boys. The first film could apply to both genders mostly, with a simple plot that all kids could follow. Yet in this movie, I could see their intentions, but putting this much girly stuff in it could potentially turn some young boys off from the film. From what I could tell in my theater, the jokes in this film also didn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t land as well as the first one. Majority of the jokes were intended for older teens and adults, with not too many kids getting any laugh out of it. In my opinion, the LEGO Movie 2  still has some stunning animation, some catchy songs, and some likeable characters, but with a convoluted plot and a dumbing down of our favorite character, this could potentially be confusing for young kids and is definitely not as fun of a joy ride as the other three LEGO movies.",

But there's quite a lack of a plotline that is easy to follow. The plot takes turns here and there and I found myself genuinely confused at parts of the movie because I couldn't tell what was really happening. You have a general understanding of the plot at the start, but as it develops, at least for me, it was difficult to follow. Another thing that I was disappointed about was that Will Ferrell was not very present in the movie. This is not a very big issue, but I absolutely loved his performance in the original and I was upset that he was never shown in the film and only had a few lines of dialogue. I think that this is a great movie, especially for young children. It is filled with lots of humor, dancing, and especially, Legos. But if you ask me, you're better off with the original.",

Now the temperature on the Lego movies has been one that has subject to change with the quickness.  I loved the original, and I thought that their take on Batman was pretty hilarious...  but I felt that Ninjago was not even worth the time of day.  Because we have been getting so many Lego movies in rapid succession, I can't help but say that they have been oversaturating; this new movie has been underperforming at the box office, and I think that is entirely because public interest has been waning.  I am fairly sad to report that I feel like The Lego Movie 2 is everything that I feared the first movie would be.  Now I know that I was hungry and a bit vexed by some really pointless traffic driving to the theater, but if this movie had really brought it, those items would have been afterthoughts.  I just didn't find this to be very funny when everything is broken down.  I wasn't bored and checking my watch or anything, so it does have a leg up on Ninjago, but at the same time, I was just waiting for this to be over after I realized halfway through that it wasn't going to get any better.  The jokes never really hit, and they are more random than anything, which is very surprising, because Phil Lord and Chris Miller penned the script (but didn't direct).  About half of the main characters from the first movie that I felt warmly about don't have anything to do here; they are completely pushed to the background, and if I could sum up this movie in a phrase, it would be lost goodwill.  I think the animation in this is still quality, and I don't have any complaints there.  I did not care for any of the music in this, and I found it more annoying than catchy, especially when they were trying to present the next \"Everything Is Awesome\" imitation.  I did think the character of Rex Dangervest (also voiced by Chris Pratt doing a Kurt Russell impression) did bring something to the table, and I will at the very least say that anything with the raptors in this did make me laugh.  Other than that, I got light chuckles at best out of this, and The Lego Movie 2 is a disappointment for me.",

However, the songs are annoying and childish and it\u00e2(TM)s defintely centred towards children. The film\u00e2(TM)s first half isn\u00e2(TM)t very good and you wonder where it\u00e2(TM)s all going but it picks up in the second half. Overall, a decent film but if you want to wait until it comes out then you\u00e2(TM)re not missing out on the best film of the year.",

            "content": "The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part is a superb follow-up to the original film that lives up to the years\u00e2(TM) worth of hype surrounding it.  Vibrant voice talent, including new standouts, and quippy writing make for a cartoon genre-defying blast. Any fans of the LEGO franchise must check this out.\n\nThe movie follows five years since \u00e2everything was awesome,\u00e2? as the citizens of Bricksburg suffered irreparable damage from the forces of LEGO DUPLO invaders. Bricksburg descended into Apocolaypseburg, where the citizens brood. Luckily, Emmet (Chris Pratt) always retains hope, even when General Mayhem (Stephanie Beatriz) captures many of his friends. This takes Emmet on a journey across multiple unexplored worlds, including a central DUPLO musical land, as the fate of the LEGO galaxy relies upon him.\n\nThe ensemble cast not only features one role from Chris Pratt as, of course Emmet, but also as Rex Dangervest. He continues to shine as Emmet, with the reluctant hero taken to deeper territories as his hope to regain his friends is tested. Rex Dangervest shines and is my favorite character, as he remains a charming presence and even mirrors many of Pratt\u00e2(TM)s roles in Hollywood. His relevance to the plot also provides for some mind-bending revelations. Elizabeth Banks, as Lucy/Wyldstyle, continues in her heartfelt buddy dynamic with Emmet, as she even wants him to do something more intimidating. This proves for an interesting drive in his quest to find Lucy. New additions from Stephanie Beatriz and Tiffany Haddish are welcome ones, with their unique DUPLO builds taking the spotlight. In particular, Tiffany Haddish as Queen Watevra Wa\u00e2(TM)Nabi, shines with her malicious intent and deceitful musical numbers. Will Arnett, Allison Brie and Charlie Day return from the previous movie and continue their signature work, with all even having a moment to shine amid this gigantic cast. \n\nMike Mitchell spectacularly directs the movie with a great mastery of unconventional animation found within, that pans out beautifully. Also, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller return with a script that might even be funnier and more meta than the original. My favorite scene is the musical number between Batman and Queen Watevra Wa\u00e2(TM)Nabi that is just a true showcase of this series\u00e2(TM) unique sense of meta-commentary and humor. My problems with the movie do stem from the real world scenes. Even though the dynamics between siblings Finn (Jadon Sand) and Bianca (Brooklynn Prince) is a very touching and even humorous one, it just doesn\u00e2(TM)t lead to much and feels tacked on, with the time gap seeming like something of an afterthought. \n\nThe message of this film is that everything will not always be awesome, but in times like those, we must always let people in and help others as much as we can. I give this film 4.5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 6 to 18.\n\nReviewed by Arjun N., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews by youth, visit kidsfirst dot org.",

            "content": "SPOILER WARNING!!!!!\n\nThe Lego Movie 2: The Second Part continues on from where the first film left us, The Duplon invading BrickBurgs, and stars the same cast which include Chris Pratt, Elizabeth Banks, Will Arnett, Tiffany Haddish, Stephanie Beatriz, Alison Brie, Nick Offerman, Charlie Day, Maya Rudolph and Will Ferrell. This movie, I found is not as good as the first movie because the first one appealed to both children and adults, whereas this one only appeals to children. When I was looking through the reviews, people were saying that Lego Movie 2, Everything is an ad. Ignore these idiots. When I viewed in the theatre I heard people laughing most of the way through, and saying that it was a great film. \n\nThe film gives us lots and lots of brilliant humour throughout which made this film truly wonderful. The funniest character was Batman because in this film Batman said loads of references which were based on previous Batman films, and that  won me over. The characters from the first like Benny, Unikitty and MetalBeard were all underused because they didn't have enough screen time and didn't make enough humour like they did in the first one, so instead we got most of the humour from The Dark Knight (Batman). A problem I have with this movie is the third act because the switch between the Legos and the human got very muddled at times so it was actually quite confusing. The other problem is that it only appeals to children, so it can be a bit childish at certain points of the film. But adults can still watch it and enjoy it. \n\nWarner Bros yet again brings us a great villain which wasn't as good as President Business, but still a great villain. The real reason why I loved the villain was because of the unexpected plot twist with him. The villains name is Rex, and he is basically the future Emmett. Even though Rex didn't have anything to do with the main plot, his motive throughout the last half of the movie was the real side to him and the last act was when he was the villain, this I what I truly loved about this character. When I viewed this film I thought that Queen Waterva Wa'Nabi and General Mayhem were the actual villains of the movie because Emmett had a nightmare about Mamageddon happening and believe that those characters were the cause of it going to happen. The song, catchy song was a very catchy song which people could bang their heads to. When the song was played for the first time Batman was flossing, and when he did the CGI for him was terrible. The references were one of the best parts of the movie. I very much enjoyed the sub plot between the family who had the LEGO, because that brought the film into much more depth and made it more exciting.\n\nAs being a huge Batman fan, I was able to spot all the references about Batman's previous films, and when those references came on, I laughed so hard. When Batman was singing in the background I noticed the most legendary thing ever, Heath Ledger's Joker, he is very hard to miss so you might want to watch it carefully so you are then able to spot it. I also spotted some Back to the Future references. When Rex dies, his death was like when Marty started fading at The Enchantment Under The Sea Dance, this reference is said in the movie so it is pretty easy to spot to those Back to the Future fans out there. There is another Back to the Future reference, which is about the DeLorean. When Rex talks about his backstory and says about his ship and how he made it, there is a reference about the DeLorean. I loved the Bruce Willis cameos in this especially The air vent cameo that he had because it was like Die Hard. This film even put in some hidden Chris Pratt reference in this. When Rex says that he is a Cowboy, A Raptor Trainer, and A Galaxy Defender, they all link to Chris Pratt's roles. Cowboy (The Magnificent Seven), Raptor Trainer (Jurassic World), and Galaxy Defender (Guardians Of The Galaxy). The last reference that I am going to point out is when Gandalf says about Marvel not returning their calls. I know that isn't really classed as a movie reference, but it will make Marvel Fans laugh out loud.  Overall, The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part, is not as good as it predecessor, but you should still watch it so you can have a laugh at times.",

Its weaknesses lie in its bland protagonists that do little more the second time around to endear you to them as anything more than vehicles for jokes (a role better served by the film's many side characters).

Everybody saw it and the reviews were very highly rated. I really enjoyed this one too. The story was entertaining and enjoyable the entire runtime. The humor was random, weird, and tried to be serious which made it hilarious for me. Unlike the first their wasn\u2019t like a big deep meaning to the film which I was hoping for. It was more childish and straightforward. It was also very predictable but I expected that. Once again Chris Pratt was really good as Emmet. He was made to play this role because it is him. Elizabeth Banks was also good as Lucy. I liked her a little more in this one which was a nice surprise. The other standout voice actress was Tiffany Haddish as Queen Watevra Wa\u2019Nabi. She was funny and an enjoyable character. The songs in the movie were good and catchy, especially the song Catchy Song. Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if any of them lands an Oscar nomination next year like the previous film did. I think many people will like this movie. I liked the first better.

There are a number of laugh out loud moments and the music is as imaginative as the first film. \nHowever because of the twist in the original, the cat is somewhat out of the bag when it comes to the \u00e2reality\u00e2? of the story - ie the brother/sister/parent interactions.  The moral \u00e2message\u00e2? of the film is also about as subtle as being smacked over the head with a mallet and while I\u00e2(TM)m generally in agreement with the idea of listening to each other and trying to build a better world, whilst acknowledging that everything isn\u00e2(TM)t awesome, is the right way to go, please can we stop portraying the male characters a stupid babies in need of a sensible/strong females to fix everything? This undermines the whole ethic of the film - if we do value what we all bring to the world then we shouldn\u00e2(TM)t need to blame everything on men and their immaturity. Maybe I\u00e2(TM)m reading too much into it but I did feel I was being lectured in the last third of the film. \nMy 2 kids enjoyed it although my 12 year old definitely recognised it lacks the magic of the first while my 7 year old enjoyed the appropriate silly bits and the music - and Batman \u00e2Flossing\u00e2?!\nI\u00e2(TM)d imagine this isn\u00e2(TM)t the last we will see of the Lego franchise but maybe it should be.

(Though the musical element brings it down to a diet level of cringe) Admittedly, though meta jokes (and there are a lot) that landed with me did not seem to shmooze the audience as much. New characters are somewhat...confusing?...though enjoyable?? Characterization and motivation could have been thought about more, though I got no complaints about the old cast. The film maintains the child-like logic and plot structure of the first, but it at times works to its disadvantage and hurts the pacing in a Convenient Plot Device kind of way (though I have no issues with Rex's C.P.D.) And yeah, I know I'm kinda flaming a movie about Legos, but yeah, I feel like it's a quality enough franchise to be doing this WOULD RECOMMEND 3.75 STARS.",

It cemented Chris Pratt as a lovable movie star. It continued the trajectory of directors Lord and Miller (Jump Street) as filmmakers who make terrible concepts into snarky brilliance. It proved that CGI can be more than sterile carbon copies of Pixar. But most of all it used self-referential humor and meta-commentary to honor imaginative play, never kowtowing to either kids or adults, serving them both equally. Unfortunately, most of that celebratory creativity begins to fade in this chaotic and pale imitation of a sequel. \nWhen a race of Duplo-designed aliens transform Lego world into Apocalypseburg, abducting some of its most notable citizens, Emmet and Lucy have to lead an adventure to get their friends back. The meta-humor (\u00e2Marvel won\u00e2(TM)t return our calls\u00e2\u00a6\u00e2?), though fairly one note, is still relatively funny. The songs, of which there are much more, are good. Pratt still shines as the oafish goofball hero, all while sending up his other big franchise roles. Otherwise, throughout the meat of the film, the kinetic plot and comedic brilliance is much less effective and simply less funny.\nBy the end, some story re-positioning works to positively reset everything previous. It really leans into the real-world youth master-builders story more, cleverly playing with the line between their playtime and their imaginative Lego world, revealing a welcome sweetness.

            "content": "The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part (4 out of 5 stars). The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part lives up to the original Lego Movie. It is fun, colorful and stylish with its beautiful animation. The characters are hilarious and filled with pop culture references. Writers Phil Lord and Chris Miller (who directed the original) created another fun filled movie that will entertain adults and children. The film begins were the first movie left off. A little girl's lego toys gets into the mix with the boy who created a lego world and had a story behind it. Emmet (Chris Pratt) and Lucy (Elizabeth Banks) battle out an invasion of colorful unicorns and child like stars that can be deadly. 5 years later, the lego world is turned into an apocalyptic wasteland. (Almost looking like Mad Max with its monstrous cars and its survival setting). Emmet's friends are kidnapped by some figure from space. Taking them to a Systar system led by Queen Watevra (Tiffany Haddish) were she might have an evil agenda to the lego world. The film's plot is entertaining. I love how the concept went into an apocalyptic setting. While Emmet is having trouble adjusting to the change and is still his friendly happy self. While everyone else is on the edge. The characters are a lot of fun. Emmet is hilarious as a positive type of guy. Batman is still stealing the show with his narcissistic humor. Some of the dc characters make appearances and are a lot of fun as well. Queen Watevra is an interesting character playing a shape shifting alien. The film moves at a fast pace and never has a dull moment. There are plenty of jokes, references that were mentioned which will get adults to laugh. There is another fun character Rex who is the complete opposite of Emmet which was a fun addition. There is a lot of action that is fun. The animation is stunning and looking at its finest. There is also another equivalent musical song moment called Catchy Song which will get stuck in your head. And has a high energy that may drive you nuts in a good way. Just like how the Everything is Awesome song was in the first movie. Overall, The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part is a good film. It lives up to the original movie. The plot is good. It has a lot of fun humor and references that will keep adults and kids entertained. The animation and action is exciting and beautiful.",

Everyone who doesn't agree that this movie is a blast to watch because of the animation alone is lying.\n\nThe biggest surprise is not even the, at least for me, unexpected plot twist, but the fact how seemlesly, believably and simple the two main worlds (boys and girls toys) were mixed to create a logic universe. This could have gone so wrong (I even read somewhere that this movie is made to embarise men), and instead with General Mayhem we get a really cool antagonist that is apealing across genders and probably cooler than Batman.\n\nLook, I get that noone was waiting for this sequel, but if you are honest, noone was waiting for the first Frozen movie either. It's a light entertainlemt, easy to digest, apealing for kids, with a soundtrack that doesn't make you want to peel the skin off your skull, with music bits that don't make you roll eyes like in some movies by the big D., with some genuine laugh out loud moments, a movie that creates a perfect mix of two genders, that will apeal to girls and boys alike, one that parents can let the kids see without having to be scared what junk will be fed to them, and one that's simply innocent.",

While the 'whiz-bang' magic of the first one is long gone (with the first Lego film and the impressive Lego Batman film out of the way), the film remains consistent in entertainment and message.\n\nDefinitely worth your (and your kids) time and money. Everything is still awesome.",

            "content": "The question is without the first Lego Movie's element of surprise and low expectations, can Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (now only as writers and producers) repeat their success with the Second Part 5 years later. Happily, I can say for the most part the answer is yes, as I giggle along to this heart-warming and entertaining sequel which follows directly on from the first one's live action twist when we find out that the crazy mismatched Lego world in which the movie was set in is actually Will Ferrell's dad's huge basement Lego playset being reimagined by his then 8 years old son, Finn. For the sequel, we see the arrival of Finn's younger sister Bianca and her Duplo invaders which has turned Bricksberg into the Mad Max wasteland that is Apocalyspeburg. Once again letting their imagination run wild, everything and the kitchen sink are thrown into the mix, with new colourful and sparkling characters mingling with returning favourites that will dazzle the younger audience while knowingly self-referential digs poking fun at everything from Chris Pratt's career to the different incarnations of Batman will keep the adults entertained. Following the success of Everything is Awesome, they have also doubled down on the musical numbers with Broadway worthy songs and catchy earworms that will get stuck inside your head. This is a cute film that's not going to break any new grounds, and it will always be the underachieving cheeky cousin to the Toy Story franchise, but it is decently and funnily constructed and there's even an element of sophistication in the underlying message it's making, wholesome and corny though it may be. Above all, it's still miles better than anything one can expect from a movie based on a bunch of plastic bricks.",

The thematic backbone of this story, namely, is one of the more admirable and unique features in play, featuring some genuinely effective heart and a truly affecting message that should strike an emotional chord with most viewers. The humor, while definitely nowhere near as polished and indelible as the first film, is still worthy of note, featuring a couple of real banger jokes and a multitude of other relatively funny ones. The music even gets a bit of an updo this time, utilizing the decidedly hilarious musical talents of one Jon Lajoie to its added benefit. Again, none of this is particularly better than the original, but still valid at most. Just don't expect lightning to strike the same place it did back in 2014.",

            "content": "A Toy Story.\n\nThe Lego Movie 2: The Second Part\n\nMitchell is clearly afraid to try anything new. Looped in the same process that we have already seen before, this installment works on nothing but humor. And as always, the humor has been ironical, pointing out the obvious in each scenario, it mocks down its own flaws and characters from all the sides. The references too helps in a lot, a culmination of all iconic characters, bubbles up the films, TVs, sports and pop cultural references that clearly is kept in mind in order to tickle its younger audience. And mind you, it's not for that younger audience- for them the visual effects and action is enough to blow their minds- it is more armed towards the teenage audience.\n\nThe musical sequences are my favorites, especially the way they start. There is always one among them opposing to hum along the tune, usually it's Banks. But personally for me, Arnett's musical numbers makes me tickle the most. In fact, his entire track is the highlight of the film. Not tied into any strings from the actual plot, he is literally there to mock everyone. His attitude of not accepting his mistakes, no matter how many time they ride that joke, comes out hilarious.\n\nHis entire image has gone topsy-turvy; he wears white cloak, he is not a bachelor anymore and he sings and dance to all the beats, and Haddish is the one to blame. Her character swoops in with charm and electrifies the whole screen like a concert. The non-animated part of the film is not only poorly performed but also shot with dull camera work that anchors the film. The emotions that it is trying to capture through it, seems in-congruent to its tone, we are so sunk in this tomfoolery world, that sincerity grows into a myth and the makers should have been aware of it and should have toned it down a bit.\n\nPratt, voicing two characters this time, is pretty much decent in his revisiting role but much more effecting in his newer suit. The endorsement he does of himself with such commitment and a \"cool\" voice does fool us along with the characters around him. Banks, the voice of the reason, gets to play the mellow part, despite of having a completely different persona than any other characters, she fails to stand out on her own merits, \"her character just isn't ready to change.\"\n\nUnlike the previous one, there aren't lots of things going on in screen, the makers have definitely minimized the plethora of characters version which helps us stay with the narration easily. The comments passed by famous stars every now and then, steals the thunder of the scene, like when everyone rushes down Batman's house, Alfred yells, \"No shoes!\" or Bruce Willis jumping in or an eerie equation of Superman and Green Lantern, the film keeps us busy through these formulas and we all nod along effervescently. The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part is a step down for the franchise where it still might be worth playing with but the original essence is clearly missing.",

I guess I'm in the minority here, but from my POV this played as a sequel that wasn't as fresh, nor as inspired, as the original.\n\nIn the first film, half the fun came from learning the rules of the world, admiring a string of wildly different settings and identifying the slew of cheeky, energetic celebrity cameos in a long parade of licensed characters. Every one of those elements is clamped down, if not outright eliminated, in the follow-up. It's funny, it's entertaining, there's a lot of winks for the parents and silly slapstick bits for the kids, but as a whole it's much more forced and cramped. Although we spend time exploring new galaxies, meeting alien queens and defending post-apocalyptic landscapes, the universe is smaller and far less diverse. The same voice actors reprise the same roles for the same cameos, but this time it's more of an obligation and less of a spontaneous surprise. \"I know that guy!\" becomes \"I remember that guy.\"\n\nI don't want to sound too harsh here, because the story does represent a logical continuation of simmering themes that were present in the original, and the music is once again a major highlight, but it's not a great sign when the film's most clever, imaginative scene takes place during the credits. Maybe a growing pain for the franchise; there's still plenty of fertile ground here, but it's going to take a little more effort to re-bottle that jolt of lightning.",

This film has really no idea where they wanted to go with anything in this film. This causes lots of issues in the movie because they didn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t have a straight forward plot that everybody could easily follow. I\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)m going to try and not spoil it but in the first movie, there was a great plot twist that caught everybody off guard but this film they tried to do that and caused more issues in the plot. It made no sense and could have easily been taken out of the film and it would be a bit better. In the first film, we got the great song \u00ef\u00bf 1/2Everything is Awesome\u00ef\u00bf 1/2\u00c2? so this film had to try and outdo that song and I will give them credit for trying. One of the songs is called \u00ef\u00bf 1/2Catchy Song\u00ef\u00bf 1/2\u00c2? and it\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s not catchy one bit. At some points, the film just comes to a halt so they can fit in a pointless song that it doesn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t need. All we needed was one good song in the film and instead, we got ten annoying songs. The first movie didn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t overuse humour but this one tried to stuff it in at every point they could and it doesn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t work. They used humour that broke the fourth wall and only older audience members would get which isn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t good since this is a film that\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s gear towards kids. The message in this film is a good one but it\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s forced down your throat so much that you don\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t really care about it. They also pretty much say it and spell it out throughout the entire movie. The pacing in this film is way to fast to help understand anything that\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s happening in the film. Really the only good thing about this film is the animation. In the end, I think this film could have been good if they kept the original directors on board. This film isn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t good for teens or adults and maybe kids will enjoy it but I would suggest seeing something else instead of this film. I give The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part a 5/10.",

I'd put it in a tie with Lego Batman for the second best installment in the franchise.\n\nThis is a natural progression from the first one as we see LEGOs go against DUPLO and the girl audience-style LEGOs. Considering that they're the two other biggest brands of LEGOs, it just makes sense. It is also an interesting viewpoint on conflicting styles on imagination based on age and gender.\n\nThough you couldn't really top the surprising twist from the first film, this one does contain a couple pretty effective reveals which like the first really support the emotional beats of the film.\n\nLM2 is also a bit of a light musical. Due to the success of \"Everything is Awesome,\" they added on the songs here and they work pretty well. The two best musical numbers hands down go to the ones sung by Tiffany Haddish's Queen Watevra Wa'Nabi. The comedian/actress is a surprisingly good singer. The songs are even catchier than the \"Catchy Song,\" which was the movie's attempt to match \"EiA.\" (I mean it's catchy but only short-term catchy.)\n\nThe movie looks great. The new universe of the Systar System is really well designed and colorful. The scenes that take place in the \"other dimenson\" are really well lit and have a very 80's/90's feel to them. The constantly shape-shifting Queen Watevra Wa'Nabi is an impressive bit of animation. (Though it still doesn't match the amount of effort that went into the form-changing Greedy scene from Raggedy Ann & Andy: a Musical Adventure. Check it out, it's really impressive.)\n\nAs mentioned, this doesn't quite match the first, which in fairness is a high bar to reach considering how everything worked almost flawlessly. There are many funny jokes here, but not the rapid succession that were in the first. Pacing isn't as fluid either. The likes of Benny, Ultrakitty, and Metalbeard are present throughout and have some nice lines, but they really don't contribute much. Basically, the writers were trying to include the whole cast, but since they were telling a more personal story between leads Emmett and Wildfire, they didn't seem to know what to do with everyone else.\n\nNitpicks aside this is a film that I think the whole family will like.",

            "content": "When it comes to films made for children, you have to let certain things slide that may have you rolling your eyes or making you annoyed, simply because the jokes aren\u00e2(TM)t for you. Personally, I feel that\u00e2(TM)s only true for some films and The Lego Movie definitely didn\u00e2(TM)t fit that description, because it was made for everyone. For that reason alone I was very excited for the sequel, The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part. This sequel is surely made for a younger audience, more so than its predecessor, but the heart and comedy is just as present. This is one of the best direct sequels I\u00e2(TM)ve seen to a film in quite some time. These two films go hand in hand and I don\u00e2(TM)t want to see a third addition, simply because these two work so well together. \n\nPicking up immediately following the events of the first, Finn has to allow his sister to play with Legos in the real world. Jumping five years into the future to show what has become of that, the heart of this film may even be larger than the first film as a whole. The sense of adventure and originality is only slightly lost here, seeing as the charm of the first will never be fully captured again. There was something very special about that one and I believe that was lightning in a bottle. That truly is my only gripe with this movie, because The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part builds off the characters from the first film and creates an equally enjoyable ride of a film. \n\nWith Chris Pratt, Elizabeth Banks, Will Arnett, and Tiffany Haddish (just to name a few) as the leading voices of your film, it\u00e2(TM)s hard to go wrong in terms of how your comedy will be delivered. I found myself laughing hysterically on multiple occasions. From the clever puns to the emotional core this film brings by the third act, this is a movie that had a lot of care put into it and the vocal performances only helped that. The characters in the real world were further explored, making me appreciate the first film even more and the addition of Rex Dangervest to the cast of characters was easily one of the highlights of the movie. \n\nNot that I had an issue with these aspects, but where I fear this film may lose some viewers is in its musical numbers. This movie has a lot more catchy songs than the first film and characters even break out into full musical numbers. If you\u00e2(TM)re not into musicals, certain scenes may annoy you here. That being said, the lyrics were hilarious and extremely clever, which made for enjoyable sequences. This is a film that knows the audience it needs to pander to and I felt this film was striving for that a little more than the first.\n\nIn the end, The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part felt like an earned sequel that carefully took the best aspects of the first and built on them. While the spark and magic the first film left many viewers may not be completely present here, it\u00e2(TM)s very hard to complain about this sequel. Seamlessly blending emotion, comedy, and the sense of adventure, I had an absolute blast with this movie. The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part was worth the wait and is more than a worthy sequel.",

The theme of sibling rivalry and how they must come together was a bit on the nose. The comedy was not clever at all.  By now the LEGOS are gods, they can build anything and now move in the real world. It was fun at the end of the last one to see the kid was making up the whole thing, but in this one they took it too far. I was very excited to see what President Business would be in this new apocalypse city. Though in the first 2 minutes, he leave for golfing. Lucy's story is really just watching Emmet's story unfold and helping where she can. I saw the screening of this movie, where they had the story of Lucy. She was named Bluerazz and sung \"Everything is Awesome\". That part of the movie was really bad and I'm glad they left it out. Unikitty was kind of funny in the first movie, a sweet kitty that can turn very dark. Now, to get more money off toys they make Unikitty darker and more angry. Batman was reduced to comic relief and the love interest of Tiffany Haddish. Before I get to the worst part for me, there were some good parts. Queen Whatev-ra Wanabi was hilarious and her song was actually good unlike every other one in this movie.  The bombs were funny and Maya Rudolph is always welcome. My favorite part of the movie was at the end when Maya steps on the LEGO. Rex Dangervest. When he appeared on screen, we could hear Chris Pratt's obvious voice and the twist was revealed. Through out the movie, he teaches Emmet to be evil and destroy things. The whole philosophy of Emmet is that he is a good, nice person who can't be turned. Rex goes against everything and undoes his whole character. He becomes LEGO Jesus at the end when he can move on his own. He travels back in time and appears at the start of the movie, and the kid accepts it. The kid doesn't question that a random LEGO just appeared, started moving on its own, and talking to Emmet. The plot holes in this movie can never be explained. This movie was not good and was a cash-grab sequel of a good movie.",
