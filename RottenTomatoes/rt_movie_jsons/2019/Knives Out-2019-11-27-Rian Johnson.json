            "content": "Knives Out - How to do a Plot Twist\n\nI have never seen a better example of subverting expectations than in Rian Johnson's Knives Out. If you want to shock your audience and do it right rather than some cheap trick, then there is no better case study than this film. There are rarely other films like this that perform a plot twist so effortlessly.\nFirst of all, the plot twist we're talking about is Hugh Ransom Drysdale (played by the evil sweater wearing Chris Evans) being revealed as the true killer instead of Marta (played by Ana De Armas) which is believed to be the one almost throughout the entirety of the film.\n\nThe reason why Knives Out's plot twist works so well is because the film flips genres after a third of the way through. The entire first act is about it being a whodunit mystery; but, at the end of the first act, it exactly tells us what happened and who did it (in this case, Marta) and seemingly answers all our questions. All of a sudden, with the flip of a coin, it's no longer a whodunit; it's how the hell is Marta going to get away with it? And what I love so much about this genre flip is because it takes the story forward in an entire new direction. This flip weaponizes the tropes of the murder mystery genre and they themselves are the antagonists. Now, at the end of every murder mystery, the detective always finds out who is the real killer, it's a trope and every murder mystery film has it. The detective gathers every suspect, has a monologue about the series of events and finally points out the real murderer. So now, we're even more interested as to how will Benoit Blanc (played beautifully by the Scottish Daniel Craig) will catch Marta.\n\nAnother reason as to why the twist works so well is because it makes perfect logical sense with the story and fits each and everyone's character. The twist lands so well in that sweet spot where it's damn near impossible to figure it out beforehand but extremely obvious in hindsight. This is done beautifully due to the order in which information is fed to us. One example is the dogs barking clue where it becomes obvious who is the killer but we've reached a point in the film that we don't care about it and simply ignore it.\n\nThe last reason why I love this film so much is because we get everything the film promised itself to be. We get a murder mystery plot resolved (which was thought to be dead at the end of the first act) along with another plot of genre flip which collapse with each other in a beautiful cathartic climax.\n\nThere is not better way to say this. Rian Johnson, You're The Man!",

Its 2-hour runtime flies in as the viewer is assaulted with twists, turns, and the unbelievable talent of all actors involved. Daniel Craig stands out as Southern PI Benoit Blanc and perfectly represents the eccentricity of the film but also the control, keeping it away from but never too far from becoming a caricature of itself.\n\nAn absolutely wonderful film that completely exceeded my expectations.\n\nFor the full review and more like it, visit my site: https://thephoenixprjct.com/knives-out-benoit-blanc-1-basic-review/",

So we have a pseudostylish film with character tropes and a mystery that never unfolds. It reeks of arrogance. It feels like somebody who desperately tries to be original - but isn't.",

But Knives Out figured out how to do a fun, interesting mystery story, aided by the wonderful cast that clearly enjoyed making this film. Every twist and turn just gets you more enthralled in this story that they're telling, and the final reveal makes sense while catching you off guard. The plot for this film is great, but my one issue is the setting. It just feels very boring in this old manor, and the other settings seen in the film aren't any better. Overall, Knives Out is a great movie, and It's a very solid start to what hopefully becomes an amazing franchise.",

            "content": "Rian Johnson's \"Knives Out\" is an old-fashioned, smartly plotted and suspenseful murder mystery proving that people of color deserve a place in a genre where they are all-too-often denied opportunities to solve murder cases due toward their race. With his first whodunnit, Johnson revives interest in a bygone genre by celebrating minorities' lives without being wounded by razor-sharp knives. It's the filmmaker's first attempt to bring a bygone genre surging back to life using social commentary as sharp as the pointed edge of a knife, but he pulls it off expertly. Using stunning visuals, Johnson draws viewers into a private detective's expeditions to investigate the unfortunate murder of a patriarch belonging a wealthy estate. Evoking Robert Altman's \"Gosford Park\", Johnson expertly utilizes the confined mansion location to create tension amongst the suspects of a murder investigation whose motives are called into question. Like the wealthy socialites disturbed to discover their lives are in danger following murders in Gosford Park, the confined mansion showcases the bitter rivalries amongst the Thrombey family. Johnson showcases immense control over the production-design, editing and music, creating an unforgettable cinematic experience. Johnson's screenplay is superb, creating a compassionate depiction of a marginalized community through subverting the whodunnit genre's conventions. One appreciates fantastic performances. Daniel Craig delivers one of his greatest career performances as Benoit Blanc. With mesmerizing expressions, he captures the angst, intelligence and suspicions of a detective determined to solve a murder investigation involving a family experiencing dysfunction. Ana de Armas is amazing as a ferocious Latin-American housekeeper who takes a stand against privileged employers wrongfully accusing her of murder. Armas conveys the resilient humanity of a housemaid through her expressions rather than words. Finally, Chris Evans deserves appreciation. As a snobbish son that mocks his family, he brings comical relief to the movie. Although \"Knives Out\" is undeniably a gripping murder mystery, it isn't a film without flaws. It builds toward predictable conclusions that lack satisfying closure. One can easily guess the identity of the killer which takes the tensions out of this murder mystery. Nevertheless, fans of the murder mystery genre will definitely appreciate \"Knives Out\" and so will movie-goers seeking exhilarating entertainment. If Cinema is a political art-form with the power to bring about change that can be used by filmmakers to speak out on issues which they are passionate about without having bloody knives drawn out, hopefully it will provide modern-day immigrants facing a drought with a Clue how to go about fighting for their basic human rights in a worn-out country governed by racist politicians that have sowed a seed of doubt from which marginalized Latin-American communities have all-too-often been turned out.",

All-star cast has made it possible for me to enjoy every single minute of this whodunit except for maybe Daniel Craig who was trying a bit too hard at times to imitate the southern accent and his overall performance was in a way just another Hercule Poirot imitation but a fine one to say the least. In short Knives Out is a no time-waster for sure; it's almost exclusively a bottled movie shot within one location, with great soundtrack, solid characters, some witty dialogues, a bit too theatrical and hyperbolized narrative but entertaining and fun to watch nonetheless.",

But the most compelling is that absolutely everyone in Harlan's family is under suspicion and make it even more gripping! And actually the best thing about the film is the charming visual. Despite all the enigmatism of it, the visual component is very attractive and not chilling. So watch it, the plot isn't hackneyed, the cast is well chosen and it will definitely force your brain.",

I can't not mention Daniel Craig's ludicrously over the top accent in this film, who sounds like a deeply thoughtful 'sleuth of the south' type. He has a similar accent in the film 'Logan Lucky' if I remember right. \n\nThere are some intriguing plot twists, as we start to see more in terms of what happened from different characters perspectives/points of view. I also was quite keen on the main setting - a large, stately type home, which means many scenes have nice furniture and things in the background.

            "content": "Knives Out - How to do a Plot Twist\n\nI have never seen a better example of subverting expectations than in Rian Johnson's Knives Out. If you want to shock your audience and do it right rather than some cheap trick, then there is no better case study than this film. There are rarely other films like this that perform a plot twist so effortlessly.\n\nFirst of all, the plot twist we're talking about is Hugh Ransom Drysdale (played by the evil sweater wearing Chris Evans) being revealed as the true killer instead of Marta (played by Ana De Armas) which is believed to be the one almost throughout the entirety of the film.\n\nThe reason why Knives Out's plot twist works so well is because the film flips genres after a third of the way through. The entire first act is about it being a whodunit mystery; but, at the end of the first act, it exactly tells us what happened and who did it (in this case, Marta) and seemingly answers all our questions. All of a sudden, with the flip of a coin, it's no longer a whodunit; it's how the hell is Marta going to get away with it? And what I love so much about this genre flip is because it takes the story forward in an entire new direction. This flip weaponizes the tropes of the murder mystery genre and they themselves are the antagonists. Now, at the end of every murder mystery, the detective always finds out who is the real killer, it's a trope and every murder mystery film has it. The detective gathers every suspect, has a monologue about the series of events and finally points out the real murderer. So now, we're even more interested as to how will Benoit Blanc (played beautifully by the Scottish Daniel Craig) will catch Marta.\n\nAnother reason as to why the twist works so well is because it makes perfect logical sense with the story and fits each and everyone's character. The twist lands so well in that sweet spot where it's damn near impossible to figure it out beforehand but extremely obvious in hindsight. This is done beautifully due to the order in which information is fed to us. One example is the dogs barking clue where it becomes obvious who is the killer but we've reached a point in the film that we don't care about it and simply ignore it.\n\nThe last reason why I love this film so much is because we get everything the film promised itself to be. We get a murder mystery plot resolved (which was thought to be dead at the end of the first act) along with another plot of genre flip which collapse with each other in a beautiful cathartic climax.\nThere is not better way to say this. Rian Johnson, You're The Man!",

Whether you know who did it early on or are thoroughly suprised at the end, the sequence of events is enough to keep one entertained.

The atmosphere and cinematography are all extremely pleasant to look at, and the entire film is incredibly clever while also not being too hard to follow either. The acting is never just good; everyone is great in their roles, each actor or actress giving their strongest performance. The humor is also done very intelligently, with the jokes being extremely subtly added into the script. Plot is great, and the pacing is likewise great. The entire story is beautifully told and keeps you guessing from the start to finish, throwing many red herrings at you along the way. Overall, an extremely intelligent murder-mystery movie that stands tall among many others.",

            "content": "It was very hard to say no to watching 'Knives Out' and it was one of my most anticipated films since it came out. It was due to being busy and personal problems that stopped me from seeing it sooner. A lot drew me in to watching it. Absolutely love murder mysteries and seeing a lot of comparisons to one of my favourite authors Agatha Christie and the starry cast were reasons enough for me to see it, as well as the great reviews.\n\nFound myself really enjoying, if not quite loving, 'Knives Out'. Can understand why it may not be for all, if one doesn't like seeing and hearing the truth much earlier on than they would expect, and it is easy to see the ridiculing for Daniel Craig's Southern accent (which is admittedly atrocious). Can totally understand its appeal and why it was so positively received though, because to me it was a well made, well acted and cleverly written film that shows that director Rian Johnson does have a great film in him. While not perfect or one of the best films ever made (though was not expecting 'The Godfather' or 'Casablanca' etc), it is a long way from being a 1/10 film, putting it down there with most of the films riffed on MST3K, films from SyFy and the Asylum, 'Home Alone 4', 'NeverEnding Story 3', 'Titanic: The Animated Movie' and the Baby Geniuses films is insulting. As far as 2019 goes, it is towards being one of the better films of that year if not one of the very best.\n\n'Knives Out' had potential to be even better than it was. If it didn't overdo or repeat too much the vomiting running gag and slowed the final solution down (a suitably complicated one that is explained a little too fast for my liking) it would have been a better film.\n\nWouldn't have said no to the truth (well some of it was) being revealed later than it was, though even when it was placed when it was it was still in the final solution not at all what things initially seemed. The film is a little overlong as well.\n\nHowever, so much works here. 'Knives Out' looks great, full of atmospheric colour, beautiful locations (the interiors of the house are especially atmospheric), stylishly photographed and slickly edited. Nathan Johnson's score has menace and energy, without feeling overused or over-scored. Johnson directs expertly with a clear love for the genre being sent up.\n\nIt is a cleverly scripted film too, shining especially in the smart and affectionate 70s murder mystery throwbacks and deliciously salty one liners and insults from Ransom. The story never felt dull to me and even when things seemed obvious too early some ingenious unexpected twists are brought in. Can totally see how Johnson was so influenced by Christie's writing, evidenced from as early on as the terrific opening sequence and with Christopher Plummer's patriarch character (a type of character seen frequently in Christie's books). A fine example of how to bring freshness to a very familiar genre often visited, while the final solution is incredibly clever though demands full attention.\n\nMoreover, the ensemble cast, one of the best from that year, clearly have a ball. There is some delicious deadpan but also some inspired but not overdone scenery-chewing. Accent aside, Craig does a great job breaking away from his Bond image and revels being comedic in a laconic way. Plummer (RIP) is perfectly cast and while his screen time is not large he makes the absolute most of it. Ana De Armas has one of the most difficult roles and shows no signs of being taxed. Jamie Lee Curtis, Toni Collette, Don Johnson and Michael Shannon all give it everything they've got. My favourite performance came from Evans, also breaking away from typecasting, he was never this witty or salty.\n\nOverall, very, very good. 8/10",

Notable  performance by Ana de Armas.",

With movie stars like Chris Evans or Jamie Curtis as the main characters. \n\tThe story begins with one of the characters, housekeeper Fran, finding a dead body of beloved and awfully rich Harlan Thrombey. As the investigation begins, we, for the first time, can see the delicate detective Benoit Blanc played by the one and only Daniel Craig.\n\tThe death of Harlan is believed to be a suicide. Not only is the detective not sure about the death being a suicide, the detective is on lead to the true killer.\n\tThe producer and director Rian Craig Johnson is an American film and television director, screenwriter and producer. His debut film \"Brick\" won the Special Jury Prize for Originality of Vision at the Sundance Film Festival. He has also directed The Brothers Bloom and Looper \n\tThis movie with its 97% on Rotten tomatoes totally overcomes every and any predictions. It is for sure needed to add that the bar was really low after the Star Wars VIII disaster with only 42% audience score on Rotten tomatoes.\n\tThis movie is in my opinion a great addition to any watchlist. This movie made me laugh a few times and it's a great combination between a detective movie with a great plot twist and a comedy with great jokes. This movie is 100% worth watching.",
