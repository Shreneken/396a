            "content": "Avengers: Endgame - Falling Short of Expectations\n\nRegrettably, this installment of the Avengers franchise falls short. Despite my appreciation for the previous films and some enjoyable and humorous moments in this one, it fails to maintain the momentum of its predecessors. The story lacks the excitement and energy of the previous movies, and the dialogue is uninteresting, resulting in dull and tedious sequences.\n\nThe Avengers appear to be a clumsy and awkward group, posing for a photo like a bad high school reunion. However, I, like many others, have been a fan of the Avengers franchise for years, though this particular film did not meet my expectations.\n\nThe character of Captain Marvel, with her overwhelming powers, appears to be overdone and simplistic, with no real challenge or reason for her to lose a fight.\n\nOne may question whether a large collective of all the heroes was truly necessary. It seems that it was not.\n\nFurthermore, certain scenes drag on for too long, adding nothing to the already thin plot. Additionally, the absence of Dr. Strange, who possessed a crucial aspect of the story, was disappointing, as he hardly had anything to say and made only a brief appearance.",

And he has the best things of the movie, the fact that he has a son shows how really the tima has passed in that 5 years. Being the only one who did not get involved in Thanos' tragedy, he feels the pain of having lost so many, but decides to move on, not out of cowardice, but to accept a sad fate, which despite this, risked bringing them back. with Scott's idea.\nThe scene that meet his father, even we didn't know that relationship, it's nice and Tone looks really happy with that, How they both talk about fatherhood and how Tony teaches his father about it makes it even more special, also showing us how his vision of his father has changed when he saw that he raised him in the best way he could, despite sometimes being someone tough\nSeriously, why you show that Steve left Peggy in the past if in the end he will be back. I understand, the end represents the character finally recovering the past, but the first movies of Captain America, The First Avneger and The Winther Solider: They showed us that the past cannot be recovered and they emphasized that tragedy of the character, that now he can return with Peggy, it simply reduces this arc of the character that was built for years.\nThor is a comic relief from his third installment, he doesn't have much to contribute, however it is a consequence of what Thanos did to people, leaving Thor completely defeated.\nI understand the concept, but it is executed in a very poor way, yes, it is exact with Thor Ragnarok, but not with the previous films that brought Thor as a more mature character, stoic although funny at times, they could have treated him as a subject who lost hope having seen all the tragedy of his people, surrendered perhaps meditating, or even dedicating himself to killing beasts on earth in a desperate search to find a purpose.\nThanos was totally replaced by another villain, he, but from 2014\nThis movie was planned as an event, but just the beginning ruined part of the moview for me, why did you killed Thanos at the principle after anticipating him for more of 10 years and introduce a new villain in seconds?\nIt may be the same character, but it is not, it has the memories introduced in a terrible way, but not the experience of the other character, it feels like a rushed clone, they change their motivation in seconds, losing everything built in Infinity War\nThe other character doesn't have an special argument and even the trama contradicts part of their growth in the anterior movies.\nThe time travel has it's problems, they explain one thing by Bruce Banner, but we can see other when Steve Rogers returns to the present.\nIn conclusion, Avengers Endgame doesn't look like an Endgame... And it didn't have to be, I know some people wouldn't like it because they're only interested in the excitement of a franchise, but it could easily have been more artistic, which is what Marvel is looking for right now, if the end had been to accept the loss of all those people, giving more weight to the snap and the defeat of the avengers, as well as that things cannot always be avenged. Sometimes tragedies are inevitable, there are wounds that cannot heal.",

So pathetic.  Males these days have become extremely weak, thanks to the new feminist upbringing.  Mothers and society grooms boys to be weak and submissive to girls.  This is greatly hampering the things men achieve in life, and greatly affects their livelihood by having much lower confidence and self-esteem, and taking enough initiative.

I have to be honest there was even times that I was so dedicated to it being like the comics and actually hating it at the time because I thought it should be more like the comics but I still continued to watch to see where it goes and I never regreted it at all and I'm really eager to see where it goes even with a few speculations on on what could happen next. The wait for this movie was absolutely nerve-racking because I needed to know what have happened and I even went to lengths as to only seeing the trailer once and to avoid any speculation on every social network because I didn't want any spoiler. When I went to the theatre to watch this it was one of the best experiences I have had, the only thing was that I booked this movie so far in advance that by time the movie's release date changed earlier so I went days after its release date yet the atmosphere was if it was the first day, I couldn't believe how everyone was more energetic than ever and how there was people dressing to the theme of the movie. Usually I don't like when people would interrupt the movie by being loud and annoying but I actually enjoyed how everyone was reacting to everything, and nobody was actually scared to show any emotion for what was happening in the movie theatre and the we would collectively cheer at certain scenes. No matter what anyone would say about this movie, whether it's slower, or more different than the Infinity War but this movie brought so many people together even when the movie was already out we all wouldn't even post spoilers for each other because we all didn't want to ruin it for someone else, it's amazing how a movie like this brought us all together in unity. \n\nThis movie is such a rollercoaster ride of emotions, it shows us at them at their lowest point to make the fight mean so much more because they know they cannot lose again. The cinematography is absolutely amazing, I feel like the effect are far more solid in this movie than Infinity war, all details are more sharper and clearer, and everything especially the end battle is so cinematic. That end battle is the reason why this movie was needed to see in IMAX 3D, I feel sorry for those who missesd out on the IMAX experience. The sound was far better aswell especially the beginning and the ending, the score was just perfect and the ending you were so focused on the battle that you would even forget how about all the amazing sound effects. The story as actually emotional and feel more solid for a final ending, Infinity war felt like an event but this more like a story, which I think was absolutely brilliant because we go to see very upclose to the amazing performances that everyone gave, everyone is talking about Robert Downey Jr but Paul Rudd and Scarlett Johansson have such an amazing performance, it's so underrated. Watching all the movies from the MCU makes this movie far more emotional than ever because you get really emotionally invested in all the characters that was snapped away and it feels so surreal to not see them throughout the entire movie so when you see them for the first time return is such an emotional experience, I think the three hour length worked in that favour because you really feel the wait and when you finally see everyone return you just want to cry.",

            "content": "Endgame does indeed have a really solid final act, featuring some stellar and complex CGI, intricate blocking and an emotional gut-punch.  However, Endgame is also 3 full hours long, and because the movie opens up with Thanos being killed and his power being unable to be reversed, and thus, it turns into a Time Travel/Paradox film.  This in itself isn't a problem, beyond the fact that it opens up by having our heroes IMMEDIATELY accomplish what they couldn't do throughout the ENTIRE previous film (with twice as many of them!), but this also results in the film spending 2 hours just screwing around.  It creates logical fallacy after logical fallacy, and doesn't even do the slightest to try to repair them, making anyone paying even the slightest attention to the logistics a massive headache.  What's worse is that ALL of these logical fallacies that the film just dumps onto the audience with reckless abandon are SOLELY done to generate laughs.  This is not just involving the cross of their own time-streams, but things like Past Thanos discovering Earth's plan to stop him ~5 years in the past.... only to have him opt to wait to the present day to attack Earth..  Lastly, while I actually dig the spirit of the female-hero moment, I think it would've worked a lot better if it didn't open up with all of them lining up, knowing that they had a moment to shine.  Seriously, I just imagine all of the female heroes fighting, and then being like \"Oh wait wait - stop fighting, our moment's coming up -- Quick, get in position!\"  However, the movie isn't exactly a loss, and like I said, the final act is engaging and catharsis, at least for the most part.  And watching Thanos punch a....certain someone clean across the battlefield was just awesome!  I could watch that bit all day!  Seriously though, there's actually quite a good movie in Endgame - it's just buried in literal hours of filler that only act to make the story contradictory with itself, which is sad because these annoyances were not needed whatsoever.",

While Infinity War is still better this film is still amazing if you have watched every MCU movie before this it's a must watch since all the fan service & easter eggs you see through out the movie elevate it. I find it interesting how the snap is something that affected everyone in the MCU no character was safe from it they have been affected by it in some way which is awesome. & this film isn't just fanservice it also gives amazing character moments like Thor getting depressed after the Avengers lost to Thanos in Infinity War he doesn't easily just lose all the fat & is back in peak shape he keeps doubting himself & feeling like he isn't worthy since he could have stopped Thanos if he aimed for the head at the end of Infinity War so when he is given the opportunity to fix things he helps out but still doubts himself luckily he gets to go back to 2013 & talk with his mom who tells Thor it isn't his fault for what happened & That \"The Measure of success of a person or a hero is how well they succeed at who they are\" & too make sure of this Thor reaches out & is so happy that his iconic hammer comes to him proving he is still worthy which repairs his self esteem. Another moment I loved was Tony meeting his father again since this time he knows his father did love him with hindsight so getting the chance to meet him again before his death must have been great for him since he did say in Civil War that not getting more time with his father is one of his biggest regrets. While the finale might be a big dumb CGI war that's a mess it did give us a great conclusion for Tony he sacrifices himself to save the Universe & having everyone tell him that he can finally rest knowing that Thanos is gone & everyone he cares about is safe kneeling in front of him during his final moments were beautiful I swore I could imagine he was hearing Yinsen's words in his head from Iron Man \"Don't waste your life, Stark\" before passing away.",

Also, when all the female superheroes line up in the battle scene at the end it pulled me straight out of the film, thankfully I managed to be engrossed in it again shortly afterwards. I think it demeans these varied and great characters in their own right to just what gender they are, that bit came off as cheap and tacky. But other than those two aspects, brilliant film.",

But then Endgame just regressed into yet another blockbuster movie with little to no thought behind. All the psychological struggle and deep reflection simply gave in to let the more amateurish and childish elements surfaced, for the sake of making children scream and buy a toy.\nThe Russos could have done more with it, but they didn't. The movie was not as good as people said it was. For me, it was not a satisfactory conclusion to the saga.",

Not bad. Clearly thrilled audiences. \n\nSadly, I'm not looking forward to the way forward for Marvel from here... (Eternals et al: E flopped *ridiculously* $402M? Heh, yea the future is *lame*).",

Overall, I really do like Infinity War better. At the end of the day, Infinity War was just a wildly new experience, it was such a gamechanger and crowd-pleaser. Not only that, Infinity War I think had a better final battle. This final battle, while boasting the biggest ensemble of Marvel heroes we've ever seen on screen, is weirdly dark and muddied in CGI scenery compared to the battle at Wakanda from Infinity War. Also I hate Professor Hulk, he's just not that fun. Okay so those are my criticisms, what did I like about the movie? I guess everything else? The time travel plot let's us revisit and honor some old moments in Marvel with a new lens in sort of a Back to the Future Part 2 way that's a lot of fun, and it brings back some characters I didn't think we'd ever see again. The movie has a big emotional core, and a climactic end that is godamn powerful. This movie juggles a lot. Seriously this is like watching someone juggle 10 flaming chainsaws, it's a godamn miracle it works at all. That it works this well is even more of a miracle. It's an imperfect movie, but perfectly satisfying conclusion to this arc of the Marvel saga.",

Starring some of the biggest Hollywood actors like Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans or Scarlett Johansson, the ,181 minutes long, movie is based on a Stan Lee story. The film took places just after Avengers Infinity War where 50% of the world's population has died. The rest of the superhero group \"Avengers\" tried to finally beat the bad guy Thanos. The Plot can look Utterly complicated but in fact, with all the others MCU movie all take Sens and the plot looks way better and perfectly made. In facts they used all the characters well and give them all a custom end. I loved that movie and in my way it's a stunning, amusing and fast-paced film. The acting is also highly impressive, and the ending is outstanding: it gives goosebumps. We feel the giant budget and it has been used very well when we see the specials effects which are also outstanding. To conclude I'll say that the filming techniques are superb like the close plan at the end or the panorama plans to see all the army. And the photography looks profoundly elaborate as the luminosity or the settings.  So I recommend it as well without hesitation.",

Was it a satisfying conclusion to the Infinity saga that has dominated movie screens for 3 presidential administrations? I would say the answer is yes to both those questions.\n\nFirst off, this movie is king and barely has downtime. The fighting itself doesn't take up the majority of the screen time, but the plot is constantly moving forward. I was quite surprised how the plot mostly focused on undoing Thanos's actions from the previous movie rather than defeating him. His character is dealt with quite early in the movie, so his return at the end was welcome. \n\nThe thing the movie does best is show the respect due to its characters that have been with them since the beginning. The new(er) characters get plenty of time to shine, but the veteran characters are really front and center. Also, this movie is not afraid to kill off characters you love. It feels like the directors knew we were mature enough to understand that not everyone can have a happy ending all the time. \n\nThe only downside of this movie is how many previous details you have to remember from the tons of movies that came before it. I understand you can't spoon feed your audience every little detail, but man, there are a lot of characters and plot lines you have to remember if you're going to get every detail spelled out in this movie. All-in-all, this was a fantastic movie. It will be remembered for a long time to come as a grand event on the silver screen that capped off a series millions of people around the globe fell in love with.",

It is the twenty-second film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. and is the final and secondary film in the Phase 3 cinematic universe.\nThe film was directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and written by Christopher Marcus and Steven McFeeley.\nThe plot of the film is to bring people who have been snapped back to their former glory by searching for gems in the past, while the main character is led by Robert Downey Jr. as Tony S. Stark / Iron Man has a very prominent role and it's impressively well-acted. On the villain side, Josh Brolin plays Thanos, a very smart villain. Overall, I liked the storyline of this movie, the story of the journey while getting back the gems was fun and very addictive. As for the end of the story, it was very intense and impressive. And it's a bit sad, but this movie is a good start to the storyline of Phase 4. I was expecting Marvel to do well with the script, the CG settings, the sound, and it didn't disappoint really. All the actors did a great job. Until arriving here, the impression that everyone has been together for a long time until the end will become a beautiful new beginning, although very sad because of an unexpected ending and relationship. It shows the friendship that the characters have to each other that makes the audience feel the same way. Feel connected to the characters equally, including me.",

But that doesn't make the movie any less fun.\n    In this movie, we will meet the most exciting and epic battle in the Marvel Universe that we may not have seen in any other movie because of the fight against the eternal villains, Thanos, who has already possessed Infinity Gallet with all colors of gems, made him very powerful and made the all of the Avengers join in the fight. After all, it feels bent that the main character like Iron Man has to give up his life, and it's a scene that brings tears to my eyes.\n   Avenger: Endgame, even though it's the end, I think it's the most perfect ending. Since protecting others requires sacrificing something or even someone's life to keep all the people on this planet alive, that's what we appreciate call them 'hero'.\n   From the previous episode I watched, Avenger: Civil War, I felt that episode was really dreary and compared to this episode, making it clear that Marvel has evolved even more, whether it's a story walk that makes more sense, the effects are made me goosebump and think that it would cost more than a billion dollars. It likes Endgame is the best episode for all Avenger movies I've seen.\n   Compared to movies and cartoons, I still feel that the movie itself is still not as detailed as it is in comic books, probably because with a few hours to screen and many books that can be released, it has to be partially dissolved.\n   In the end, I'd like to conclude that it's a movie that's worth watching for once, but if you don't like such fantasy action movies, I wouldn't recommend it to you since it makes you feel dizzy and not fun at all, but for the fantasy action movie disciples, I recommend it to you all\n\nI love you 3000 ❤️",

Also the movie relies a lot on convenience I know there's the Ant-man rat thing and the time-travel but those aren't even the worst part for me. The worst part is that everyone knows exactly how things work and their always right. Like drunk Thor (another really bad part of the movie) can explain exactly how everyone needs to get the reality stone AND always knew that Captain America was \"worthy\" but the movie tries (and succeeds) to make him look like an idiot. But other than those main issues this movie is pretty good and I really just have a couple issues here and there. If you somehow haven't watched this movie I'd reccomend it.",

It was an epic culmination that satisfied millions of fans worldwide. Because of the enormous success of Avengers: Infinity War, I wondered if this second part could top it. And to my amazement, it did that and even exceeded my expectations. It was even more epic and tragic than its predecessor. As expected, it had excellent special effects, great casting and acting. Well-distributed character spotlights. The plot wasn't perfect, but the overall grandiosity and intensity more than made up for it. There's a few fan service scenes that made the audience cheer. There's enough suspenseful battle scenes to keep you at the edge of your seat. Although some scenarios were predictable, there were a couple of scenes that still caught me by surprise: heroic sacrifices that will shock you. Disney/Marvel has succeeded in blowing us away, capturing our hearts, and giving us beloved characters that we will remember for a long time. Endgame made us realize that superheroes can be human too: they can feel love, be hurt and grieve. This epic conclusion will remain in our hearts because it inspires us and makes us believe that there can be hope even in the bleakest situations. It's no surprise that Avengers: Endgame has become  one of the highest-grossing films of all time.",

Let's be honest here, the only reason Thanos was brought to the heroes present was to do some fan service and finally see The Avengers kicking his ass, but the way he was brought was really stupid, Nebula tinkered with the transporter software and was able to bring all that people to another age, why? In this case main timeline's Nebula had to be able to do that too and she didn't even collaborated when building the machine...\n\nA good movie, very emotional, but in my opinion, not better than the previous Avengers entry.",

Stopped boring us with Captain America holding on to the past making him an old man at the end and then showing the viewer a dancing flashback, I would have #1 never written this junk filler. Captain Marvel was never fully developed and honestly she can destroy a giant fleet of alien ships about to invade earth but can't beat Thanos when he's not even wearing the stones. Stupid too they cut her hair like the hair is a symbol of the lgtbq community why not just make her co-pilot her girlfriend and leave her hair alone.  Also black widow and Hawkeye and that whole infinity stone retrieval scene was dumb. Nebula could have warned them about what to expect and the death guy at the mountain told them they'd have to sacrifice who they loved most a soul for a soul. Black widow is not narcissistic and in love with herself yet she dies. When the scene should've been a double loss for Hawkeye. 1. Lose your family or if Black widow made the sacrifice 2. Hawkeye would die because she clearly has a thing for Hawkeye, the hulk, and captain America. Hulk another character they never got write excruciating to watch at times. No creativity stale dull humor there was no purpose for. Who cares he wore a shirt, it made no sense. I'm also not a time travel fan and find it a weak plot line for desperate writers and dr. Who holding water sealed it for me, his character potential so great but the writers again fail to deliver. Thor too I rather they had killed him in the previous movie than see what they did to him. Nebula such a great actress her character arc never developed fully she could have gotten the glove with the stones and finally redeemed herself but she didn't. I would do it over have the characters together beat Thanos, Wanda, strange, marvel, iron man and captain America simultaneously in superhero fashion but let Nebula get hold of the glove and undo his demise.  The dialogue was weak, with weak characters, unnecessary flashbacks, cheesy movie references, dumb fat jokes, weak scenes and slow development. Thanos even sat down in the end he was so bored he just wanted it to be over, something I could finally agree with.  Only giving it two stars because of Robert Downey Jr, Scarlet Johansson, Chris Evans and other great actors in it, even great actors aren't magicians they can't make crappy scripts turn into great movies.

I cant possibly rate higher.\n\nWhen I finally got outside I would describe the cigarette I had as less the feeding of a habit; and more as post coital.\n\nEven as the darker film of the franchise they still bring some humor and avoid going full 'DC Dark'; and you still genuinely root for the characters, terrified for their possible fates.\n\nThe third act is nothing short of absolutely epic and my advice would be to be mindful of your surroundings...as the person next to you is at risk of damage on the several occasions where you can (and will) punch the air.\n\nAnd if you dont have tears in your eyes towards the end, then you are the person the snap deserved to get.\n\nThe Russo's have done it again. You pair of geniuses!!!",

Although I thought the movie had some pacing issues and some scenes were unecessarily extended and if they removed just a few minutes of some scenes, much less would change. Nevertheless I think this is a great movie, but I think infinity war was better. Infinity war was art. No pacing issues, loads of action and really had some strong emotional moments inbetween characters and the action in this movie was STELLAR! In conclusion, I'd give endgame a 9/10",

Endgame attempts to carry this on but instead fills the Thor scenes with too much humour for me to remain immersed in his story.\nBlack Widows ending is quite underwhelming as her character has had little to do of significance since \"Age of Ultron\", also that tussle with Hawkeye feels comically misplaced. Renner is brilliant in the opening scene conveying the sense of loss and confusion experienced by a normal family.\nThe second act feels the need to move very quickly with the usual MCU humour sprinkled in far too much for my liking. The \"comedy\" scenes feel like the Russos reverted back to their \"Community\" or \"Arrested Development\" days too much for my liking.\nThe third act brings out the child in all of us and serves as one of the best thirds acts in MCU history.\nI went into \"Endgame\" wanting an emotional conclusion to the stories of our OG Avengers and in some ways I got that.",

I like the participation that is given to each original Avenger, although it is true that their characters have gone from being as serious as possible to simply being a comedy, especially Thor.\nThe visuals are HORRENDOUS! as if they weren't finished, it doesn't even look real anymore, they suck! As for the music, it works, it's nostalgic and epic, that fits very well with the movie.\nMy recommendation is that if you should see it, especially if you are a big fan of Marvel and superheroes, I would not classify it as the best of Marvel because it is far from it, just use the nostalgia factor combined with the epic part to make yourself look imposing and stand out, in a nutshell it is only fan service, it is a sack of fannservice!

This movie has a ton of fanservice and hidden advertisement. Thanos pesonality becomes more 2 dimensional character and a \"filler\" plot device. He's very weak become compare to his comic counterpart in the original Infinity War series.\n\nThis movie also adds some aftermath drama, which a little slow and sluggish. I would say this feels more like a  \"Avengers What if..?\" fun story than a epic movie. The ending the only epic part of the movie, while everything else feels like a collection of little stories combined into 1 movie (similar to the first movie, but the smaller stories are not related to main story)\n\nI am giving this movie 4 1/2 stars because I still think this movie is better than 95% better than millions other random movies that exist, but it's my least favorite avengers movie because of sluggish and bloated story plot.\n\nThe limits of the infinity stones really suck compare to comic books, and the time rules suck (they are blending different sets of time rules... you should only focus on 1 set of time rules per a time movie/franchise). The \"limits\" of only certain people is kind of dumb... I know they didn't want certain actors to come back... I think it just better to recast characters or if killed some characters \"after\" brining everyone back. The Loki show after this, treats the infinity stones like garbage.

For everyone else though, see this movie, enjoy it, and possibly even see it again. This is by far one of my favorite films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and has plenty of scenes I will be watching again and again when it releases on Blu-ray.",

I feel in this way, the deaths in this film and the one before it are hollow where they have little meaning due to them being resurrected in a spinoff or in canon. Admittedly the special effects are impressive and the sheer scope of the movie is as well but is undermined by a destructive and substance-less story in addition to the its copious runtime.

You can't change the future by simply going back to past. But it's possible to create a different alternate future. It's not butterfly effect. Every decision you made in the past could potentially create a new timeline. For example, the old Cap at the end movie, he lived his married life in a different universe from the main one. He had to make another jump back to the main universe at the end to give the shield to Sam.\"\n\nThis explanation plus the re-watch factor bumped this film up on the list. It truly is the epic finale that we have been waiting for. If Disney decided, they could easily end the MCU on this note. (Side note: They didn't and I'm grateful).",

            "content": "An Action Full Movie that Discards Itself from Real Cinema\n\nAs big, lasting fan of Marvel, I had trouble enjoying this long-waited finale at the fullest. After being left lost and confused on the event of Infinity War, we had to wait for a year to fully understand what was going to happen, and few months to start getting ideas with the small, lying, teasers. Yes, I say « lying » teasers, because today, most of Marvel's trailers provide false scenes that either make you hope or bewilder you (true MCU fans know what I'm talking about). Once more trailers were released and more information given, I was even more hyped. But when I sat at the theatre, watched the adventurous story unwrap, I started noticing how flawed and holed the narrative was. The first 5 minutes are amazing, I won't lie. But then, the story turns into this sad and forced comedy where we see a feeble Hulk dabbing, a depressive Thor that indulge his friends to play Fortnite, Tony being a jerk as always - even though he has a daughter, which I thought would have changed his stubbornness - and of course, the most annoying character of all time, a greedy overpowered woman named Captain Marvel. Then, we have the chance to understand how are they going to retrieve the stones in the past, and when it could explain it a very easy explanation, Hulk gives us the most complicated explanation about time-travel I have ever heard (you need to see the movie to understand this part). Then as the story goes on, we have a bit of action, a crying Thor (again), a great teamwork between Tony and Steve, a sad event with Natasha's sacrifice, and then once all stones are recovered, we jump immediately towards the nano-gauntlet getting the stones attached to it. We have no idea how Tony built it, how much time has passed, what is this new Thanos doing... nothing. Leaving a massive hole in the story (just like the ending).\n\nBut I prefer talking about the real issue of this movie - which isn't the massive CGI content that really is a significant reason why this movie discards itself from real cinema - which is the final battle. That battle can appear epic, for someone who only crave action and lasers and people dying from team-working heroes. But if you pay close attention to that moment, the battle doesn't make any sense at all. At any moment, they could just shred Thanos - like late arriving Captain Marvel shredded his ship in the blink of an eye. They are so many heroes, all together, strength attached, powers combined, and none decides to think « let's take him all together ». No, instead everybody just prefer attacking the meaningless troops that other characters like Wong, or the Wakanda's army can take care of. It's ridiculous. I know, the directors need to build tension and really focus the main characters's mindsets when it comes to fight - and of course, the actors's contracts that determine if someone will die or not. But that battle was straight up messed up. You're telling me, that in 14 million possibilities, no one sliced up Thanos's arm? The whole movie got destabilised because of Dr. Stranger's line saying they only won one battle. Yes, it creates tension and a very unpredictable story, but it lacks of sense.\n\nEventually, Marvel is no longer supposed to make sense. Now, it's just action, bad writing, and all about the actor's contracts.",

            "content": "Avengers: Endgame is a league of its own, and is my second favorite MCU movie. This movie, which marked the grand culmination of the MCU and the Infinity Saga, is a work of art that is probably a once in a decade occurrence. Endgame is a long movie, and rightfully so since it had a lot to do in that runtime. What's beautiful about the film though is that it manages to do all of that perfectly while delivering a lot of fan service moments and callbacks. Endgame is filled with references to previous MCU installments, but works them into the story beautifully so that the movie doesn't feel like it was made only for fan service. The filmmakers understood that they needed to progress the MCU and reach the conclusion of the Avengers conflict with Thanos at the same time as wanting to remind us of some notable moments from previous movies. From it's opening scene to its conclusion, Endgame is an emotional rollercoaster that grips you and never lets you go. There are funny moments, sad moments, happy moments and pretty much every kind of moment you can think of. Certain characters are given fantastic moments to shine and go through amazing arcs that show us how much they've changed since we first met them, and we get to see sides of them that we haven't seen before; certain actors give probably their best performance as their character yet. Many of Marvel's casting choices paid off immensely in this movie. The action is unbelievable and gives us an idea of what Marvel is capable of with fight sequences. The big battle of this movie gives the Wakanda one from Infinity War a run for its money. The script and directing are also phenomenal and help make the whole movie flow very smoothly. It's also nice to see certain actors reprise their roles from previous films, especially ones we haven't seen in a while. Endgame has a satisfying ending and great conclusion but still leaves plenty of room for storytelling and development, stuff we've seen recently with Disney+ shows. Thanos remains an intimidating villain in this movie and shows just how smart and powerful he can be when he needs to, giving another uncommon example of when a villain is allowed to reprise their role. There are times in Endgame where the continuity is questionable, but those times aren't very disruptive and are completely overshadowed by the good moments in the movie. At the end of the day, Endgame is a movie about failure and how it can impact people differently, but also about what it means to be a team and what you can achieve with teamwork and unity. Avengers: Endgame is the probably the best Avengers movie so far and is a true masterpiece on every front imaginable.",

Or Thanos would have never known what's going on if Nebula went to get another stone or turned off her \"wifi\". Or what if the vision that Thanos saw, was just some random moment when Nebula is just walking a hallway. Still, the biggest issue is time travel. How it works and how you could just bring anyone from death. Why didn't they figure out how to make more Pym particles or get more from a different timeline in the first place. Tony Stark figured out the whole time travel thing in like one day so I cant see why that's so impossible. And in the end, they will have to get more of those particles. Also couldn't they just go back like an hour or day before Black Widow died and bring her back from dead? The explanation is this is not possible because it'll split timelines, but does it even matter because in the end there is a timeline without Thanos, his army, Nebula and Gamora. And couldn't they just do the same thing to Tony Stark or couldn't Doctor Strange just use the time stone to bring him from death? Tony wouldn't even have to die if Captain Marvel just flew away with the clove after she destroyed Thanos' ship. Why didn't she flew through Thanos in the first place as she did through his ship? Picking the time when all three stones were in New York doesn't make any sense. There are multiple points in time when they were sitting in some random lab or just on a table. The list goes on and on, but I'll end it here. Overall this movie was just fan service and isn't nearly that good as it's praised to be.",

Upon this viewing, I thought of a tiny little hole when Nebula was able to bring back Thanos and his forces despite the finite Pym particles, but then I realized, he could have had time to reverse engineer the one our Nebula had before sending his Nebula back in her place, because time travel. The characters are so well balanced, and given the right send-offs and moving on to the next part of their journey. I love these characters 3000, and this being the sixth time I sat down and watched this movie beginning to end, I still broke down and cried when Tony gave his life for the universe.

Then when all seemed hopeless, Ant-Man emerged from the depths of the recently discovered quantum realm to open the door to the path of hope, justice, and closure. \n\nJust that moment alone made my day, but I didn't know at the time that I was in for a treat. The movie was surprisingly long, but in the end, it was worth it. The storyline for it was inspired by the comics, but once you see it, you look at it as if it's a whole other story. To watch all the avengers, new or old, coming together to fight was simply splendid. And the masterpiece of writing that it is, the movie was foreshadowed and built up so much for the last 11 years. It reflected the worst fears of avengers coming true, but despite the petrifying sight, they didn't back down.\n\n Although it did have a couple of plotholes, but downgrading a movie just because of a couple of plotholes is not the start of a good movie experience. Moreover, the characters made up for it. Captain America is a man we can all look up to. His character development was just phenomenal. The same can be said for Thor, the way he took the snap was disappointing to some people, but I think it reflects his character beautifully. Although what I didn't expect was clint's response to the situation. Being said that, seeing him back in action just brightened up the movie. And how can I not mention the MVP, iron man. Iron man, the genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist, was the most well-written character I had seen for a long time. He opened up a gate for the next generation to take the lead. And the star of the next-gen, Spiderman, not only won the heart of iron man, but he also became a fan favorite with just a couple of scenes. And the one character that made the movie what it is today, Thanos. Thanos is a character who works for the greater good and will sacrifice anything to achieve that. The thing that makes the movie so good is that he is a relatable villain. That brings out the sense of superiority in Thanos when compared to other antagonists.\n\nAny movie is incomplete without the fan-requested scenes or a sacrifice that will shake the fans to their very soul. This movie had it all. Some people hate to say goodbye, and that's why it's harder for some people than others. And to relieve their feelings, they end up hating on the movie but trust the millions of good reviews on it; it's because the movie just brings a wave of sadness. One thing that does help cope with the over-flowing sorrow is the film's pure and brilliantly designed structure. The structure brings out this incredible sensation that can be described as nothing but epicness. You are on the edge of your seat all the time, and when the movie ends, you find your butt sore with all the pressure.\n\nThis movie was the perfect ending not just to phase 3 of the MCU but also to the old style and vibe. Because now the reins of the world are in the young heroes' hands. This movie showed us that the 11 years of waiting were worth it. I don't usually say this, but if it became available, I would watch it because it makes my hair stand just by seeing the beauty that has been laid in such an elegant manner.",

The characters were... kind of the same. Many went through transitions that changed their nature. The story was terrible. It was filled with plot holes and glaring errors, almost like it was rushed through editing and then the cinemas, and escaped rather than being released.\n\nThe 90% approval rating here is odd, having increased from a previous 2/3 approval rating. It's almost like that audience watched an entirely different movie or simply doesn't care what MCU produces now. Which is good news for Disney, but bad news for any audience that expects value for money.

            "content": "I'm not interested in reading Marvel comics at all. There are some like Deadpool and Spider-Man which I love to take a look occasionally, and I have every single Black Panther comic on my Comixology (although I have only read one of them), but other than that I have absolutely no attachment to any other Marvel superhero. And yet when I watched Avengers: Endgame, I could actually feel like this is something of my dream coming true. This is something I really needed and because of this I can say I have really seen histroy getting created in comic book movies.\n\nThe CGI of this movie is absolutely intense. Every nerd's dream is to see a cast assembly of their favourite franchise characters on the big screen played by actors in live action, filled with CGI. And this movie absolutely does it. This happening in the first two Avengers movies or Josstice League didn't feel too intense since there weren't many characters, but over here there are tons of them. And that made it look really badass.\n\nWe also get to revisit all the old MCU movies and have the nostalgia of those scenes. There is an emotional scene of Tony meeting his father, but most of them are funny like Hulk smashing the cars and Starlord singing Come Get Your Love from the opening scene of Guardians of the Galaxy. The fight scene between the two Captain Americas and Nebulas was decent, but the fact that they actually chose to add them when they could have gotten away really seems nice.\n\nAnd then finally we have what we waited for in the last 3 hours. Iron Man, Captain America and Thor come together to fight Thanos. Thor looks so cool when he has lightning in his eyes. The fight scene of all three of them together against Thanos looked so well choreographed without any jump cuts, it didn't even feel like an MCU movie. And finally when all the portals open, Captain America finally says the fabled \"Avengers Assemble\" that we all had been waiting for to hear in the last 7 years.\n\nThough there are many things about this movie that I didn't like at all. First of all, Black Widow's death. I really hate Black Widow. She seems to have some sort of a plot armour around her. Throughout the entire MCU I never saw her getting beaten even once. And she fights every cool looking bad guy with 1000 jump cuts. I had heard about her death being in this movie, so I was really excited to see her finally get whooped. But even then she died BY BEATING Hawkeye. She doesn't even have the decency to take a beating. Sorry Black Widow, I think I'm never gonna like you.\n\nMy next problem comes with Ant-Man's return. A mouse? Seriously? I get MCU is supposed to be a family movie franchise but this went a little too far. It could have been something better, like Scott finding something inside the quantum field that allows him to control space and time which could later be used to gather the Infinity Stones. Then I also have a problem with the Thanos army attacking the Avengers HQ. They have such heavy weapons, and they can't even make past a force field before Hulk uses the Infinity Gauntlet? And finally my problem comes with that all-female scene. It was so cringy! I don't know much if people probably like such scenes, but why was it needed at all? It's not like anyone was looking forward to it. With all that said, I have no other problem with this movie.\n\nIn my opinion Avengers: Endgame should have been the last movie of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Making more movies completely undermines the point of this movie. It is supposed to be a culmination of everything that has ever happened throughout the franchise. Now making more movies at this point is just blatant cash grabbing. I really hope that Disney decides to start Phase 4 from scratch, since it's becoming hard to keep track of all the MCU movies at this point.",

The movie relies on fan service, without it it's confusing and eh to people who don't understand MCU lore. With that said: there is TOO MUCH fan service. Fan service is great to use, but when there is too much fan service it isn't great. There are some plot holes too, Civil War built up how Captain America and his friends are criminals then the concept is thrown out in this movie. They're pardoned for no other reason than to drive the plot. And the time travel, don't get me started. Infinity War had breathtaking, tense, and fantastic battles. Endgame had battles where two big armies ran at each other. I don't get why Okoye was marketed so much when she gets literally two minutes of screen time. On the poster, she is bigger than Nebula who has wayyyyy more relevance to the plot overall. Black Panther fading away at the end of Infinity War prepared itself truly to be great character development for Okoye, only two scenes were needed for her but nope.",

Sort of like a copy my homework but make it different. And though it may seem that Marvel is prevailing I have to note the marvel formula is becoming a little bland for me. The edgy gritty feel of DC films keep you more immersed not too mention their complex storylines still leave many for debate proving it's superiority. All in all this seems likes Marvels way of stealing DC's initial idea and turning into their own film. However it seems as though Infinity War was Marvel at it's peak while this film marks the downward slope of Marvel.",

Okay, let me just give my opinion of this film. Simply put; this is the greatest MCU film (to date) and that's saying a lot considering the classic MCU films that have come before it. This film packed an incredibly deep and emotional captivating story, filled with heart, pathos, and unmitigated joy. \n\nThis film is built on the foundation from twenty-one other films; that could not have happened without each of them. Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige along with the Russo Brothers have crafted the most satisfying wrap up to eleven years of Marvel films. Wow. What an accomplishment this film is. This run of movies is something that never been done in Hollywood history. \n\nOkay about the film, it is so unexpected. I mean I did not know where this film was going to go before I watched it. The trailers gave you almost nothing as far as plot, asides from the few things I assumed would happen; and even then a lot of things happen that I never thought they would do. At the end of Infinity War, the world is in shambles. Our remaining Avengers are dealing with something they have never dealt with before; lost. They are defeated. They are desperate and there is a sense of dread you never seen in these characters before. They have to figure out a way to get Thanos or live with the aftermath of their defeat. \n\nWhat makes the MCU films so good is despite their superhuman powers and otherworldly origins at the end of the day they're human. They have emotions. They're in pain and because you've been so invested for years with them you feel it too. They feel real and you care about what happens to them. I cannot stress enough how important that it is, that YOU the audience care about these people. So when they are sitting around having talks with each other you are just as invested and entertained by their conversation as you are by watching them punch and blast somebody. \n\nAnd you know what? Because you care about these characters so much (the audience) is rewarded with fan services as they take you down memory lane and give you another look at the moments you loved and give new context to them. The writers of this Avengers Endgame Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus do not get enough credit but they are geniuses. They know how to tug on your heart strings and make you laugh all within the same scene seamlessly.     \n\nAs for the ending- the final battle is such a tremendous triumph that has NEVER been done before; above and beyond anything ever done in a comic book movie before. You got to understand I grew up reading Marvel Comic Books since I was a small child, I know these characters and the storylines most of these films are drawn from, and I have never seen ANYTHING like this on screen before. There were moments where I yelled at the screen, clapped my hands, cheered, and geeked the f#%@K out at what I saw on screen. The things you waited eleven years to see happen, happened. And things you never thought you would see happen. And the thing you didn't know you wanted to see happen, happened. You will experience a gambit of emotions in the final hour that you never had before. \n\nThe ending of Endgame puts a bow on everything that has happened in the MCU to this point and also opens the door to the future of the MCU that I have no doubt will be just as fantastic. What a time to be alive and a comic book fan. \n\n• Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man: \nThe leader and benefactor of the Avengers who is a self-described genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist with electromechanical suits of armor of his own making. According to directors Joe and Anthony Russo, Downey was the only actor to have read the entire screenplay for the film. \n\n• Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America: \nA fugitive superhero and leader of a fugitive faction of Avengers. A World War II veteran, he was enhanced to the peak of human physicality by an experimental serum and frozen in suspended animation before waking up in the modern world.\n\n• Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / Hulk: \nAn Avenger and a genius scientist who, because of exposure to gamma radiation, transforms into a monster when enraged or agitated. \n\n•  Chris Hemsworth as Thor: \nAn Avenger and the king of Asgard.\n\n• Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: A highly trained spy, a member of Rogers' faction of Avengers, and a former agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. \n\n• Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye: \nA master archer who is a former Avenger and agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Barton has a new outfit in the film, visually similar to that of Ronin from the comics. \n\n• Don Cheadle as James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes / War Machine: A former officer in the U.S. Air Force and Avenger who operates the War Machine armor. \n\n• Paul Rudd as Scott Lang / Ant-Man: A former petty criminal who acquired a suit that allows him to shrink or grow in scale and increase in strength. \n\n•  Brie Larson as Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel: \nAn ex-U.S. Air Force pilot whose DNA was altered during an accident, which imbues her with the powers of superhuman strength, energy projection, and flight.\n\n•  Karen Gillan as Nebula: An adopted daughter of Thanos who was raised with Gamora as siblings. \n\n• Danai Gurira as Okoye: A Wakandan traditionalist from the Border Tribe, who is the head of the Dora Milaje, Wakanda's all-female special forces, and T'Challa's bodyguards.\n\nJosh Brolin as Thanos: \nAn intergalactic despot from Titan who collected the six Infinity Stones to inflict his will on all of reality.\n\nAvengers: Endgame - GRADE 🅰️➕",

Thanos is useless and is basically a prop, and is just beaten.

Also, you are telling me iron man figures out time travel by exercising for 30 seconds? Give me a break.

There's very little to complain about here. My only gripe would be the 3 hour run-time. I definitely plan on seeing it again in theaters (just going to wait a few weeks for the crowds to die down).

The feeling of dread when Clint and Natasha are flying to Vormir ending with complete heart-break is certainly one of the saddest sequences in the MCU. The subtle references to the previous films throughout the movie is the ultimate treat for the MCU's loyal fans. Chances are everything that you love about the MCU is in this movie and very little of what you don't is not. \"Avengers: Endgame\" was the biggest movie event of the 2010s, and to say the least, it did not disappoint.",

His logic is you can't change your past and it doesn't make sense. So the whole plot is just a joke. The reason why I'd recommend it is because it is the end to the arc of Tony Stark. It also has the best final battle in cinema history. The setup of the movie is pretty good as well with Thor chopping Thanos' head off. Overall, I'd give the movie a 7.5/10 Definitely watchable.",

            "content": "I am really sorry for giving this score. I am usually able to enjoy any action movie as long as it has good action sequences. But this movie has so many logical flaws it makes it hard to enjoy. How was this the only way the Avengers win (according to Doctor Strange)? Why didn't they just go back when Thor struck Thanos and had all infinity stones? Wouldn't that create a universe where the snap never happened and keep theirs with all the humans? Why didn't Doctor Strange return Tony back to life with the time stone? Because there are next to no regulations on time travel there are a million better ways to everyone back to life without so many casualties. And the scene where Thanos from the past find out about the avenger's plans feels so forced. The list goes on and on but these are not the only flaws. My other big complaint about it is the final battle. It could have redeemed the entire movie but it's good guys fighting bad guys with the sole purpose of defeating the bad guys and bad guys fighting good guys for the sake of defeating good guys. It totally lacks any tension. As a comparison the battle of Wakanda from Infinity War had the bad guys fight to get the mind stone and the good guys stalling for Shuri to have enough time to finish the surgery on Vision. It has a lot of good things as well and I don't think that these flaws make it unwatchable but so many other people praised all of the good things. Overall I do recommend watching it but it leaves so much to be desired and I feel that some minor changes could have made it so much more better.",

I got goosebumps twice throughout the (masterfully paced) 181 minute run time, I can't say many films have inflicted that on me! Love the ending and the way the Infinity Saga story wraps up.\n\nThe action is ultra thrilling, the score is fantastic and the effects remain great. I will say I don't think they nail the screen time for all involved outstandingly - that's not a negative, at all, it's just the fact that 'Captain America: Civil War' and 'Avengers: Infinity War' did it to an incredibly higher degree previously.\n\nThe cast are marvellous, pardon the pun. Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans remain superb and are still the most standout, though you also have the likes of Chris Hemsworth, Josh Brolin, Scarlett Johansson, Bradley Cooper and Mark Ruffalo - love the look of Hulk in this one, btw.\n\nI've only become properly aware of all of the MCU in the last two weeks or so, yet this still gave me a memorable experience seeing this main story crescendo like this - I imagine it would've been quite the journey 'live' from ten years or so prior to the release of this.\n\nLook forward to continuing with 'Spider-Man: Far From Home' and the end of Phase Three, and then - all things well - beyond.",

The sheer scale of it... The nostalgia, too, because we grew up watching these movies. We've been watching these characters on our screens for years. We've seen them grow and develop. I honestly think we will never get a series of interconnected movies like this in our lifetime. Who could even do it? DC tried and it didn't really work out. They were behind and they rushed it. They have a couple of good movies, but not like Marvel. And there's also the superhero fatigue to keep in mind. Maybe Disney could do this with Star Wars. There are also the X-Men movies. But I digress... \n\nI've seen the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe multiple times. I love all of the movies. They're very good as a standalone. But they're even better when you take into account the shared universe element. I genuinely believe Avengers: Endgame is peak superhero genre. It's the apex. We will never get a more epic superhero movie than that in our lifetimes. Maybe Marvel will hard-reboot everything in like 50 years, who knows... This has been an incredible journey. And I know Marvel will keep making movies, but I think it can only go downhill from Endgame. I don't believe they can outdo the Infinity Stones and Thanos storyline and everything before that lead to it.",

Some films are boring, some are bluntly stupid; and, for the most part, it turns out that \"entertainment\" can be called only a few luxuriously shot scenes, and at other times the viewer is forced to entertain himself with popcorn and cold cola.

            "content": "\"Avengers Endgame\" just has way too many plot holes in it to consider it a good movie. I admit, it was my dream as a geek to see all of these heroes united on a big screen 10 years ago, and the final battle is absolutely spectacular... BUT... Why did the whole team decide to do time travel after 5 years of what happened and not before? Why didn't the avengers just take the glove from Thanos when he already got it using time travel, rather then cutting his head off for the second time. Of course there would have been no movie, but I believe there might have been a way to made it different. Marvel loves time travel, and whereas DC explains it as something that Flash can naturally do, Marvel Comics do it in nearly every single one of their comics events, especially \"Age of Ultron\" and \"Days of Future Past\", in which wolverine did all the time travelling by himself. It just feels like a really fast paced ending. We didn't really get to feel the emotions of the characters and struggle with them, as they have lost their fellow comrades, all we have got is, \"That's not how time travel works\". There was no explanation to how Hulk got to control himself, how did Tony Stark get a baby in such a strange time and why. How did Thor get so fat and why, if he understands that he could not be worthy for the hammer he so desperately wants to handle again. Why is there no explanation to what will happen to these dimensions where the Avengers travelled to, taking all these artefacts? Our Thor took his Mjolnir, but Thor of that dimension would be forever doomed and will struggle in many future fights, most especially why did his mom allow another Thor to handle it? What will happen to these worlds without the infinity stones? At least in \"Age of Ultron\" comic it showed that the time travel can make consequences. But, besides it's many flaws, \"Avengers: Endgame\" is a good ending for most of the characters and could be entertaining enough to watch if you are a fan of the franchise, but not if you are a fan of movies overall.",

Todo.\nComo Blockbuster, Avengers: Endgame es una película que no teme en aventurarse de una manera sutil y satisfactoria en terrenos más complejos y pantanosos, y hacer remembranza de hitos culturales modernos. De esa manera, nos encontramos con una recuperación del espejo de Tarkovsky, espejo roto y confuso, en un decidido pero dolido Capitán América al observar su propio trasero; un Tony Stark presa de la 'fosterkaneitis', no pudiendo hacer las paces con su propia existencia a pesar de la infinidad de recursos; una Viuda Negra levantando sus femeninos puños y clamando por un lugar de heroísmo y valentía que desde los orígenes de la civilización occidental estuvo siempre reservado a aquellos que pueden alardear de un falo, audacia cinematográfica que hasta el momento sólo podía disfrutarse en las producciones de un joven Cassavetes o la belga Akerman, pero que Marvel la extrapola al cine de masas; la crítica brutal y devastadora al narcisismo y a la apatía actuales (claramente inspirada por los movimientos filosóficos contemporáneos) de la mano de la actuación 'oscar worthy' de Mark Ruffalo como Hulk, cuya desconexión con la realidad es tanta que al perder a su amada, sólo puede atinar a revolear un banquito de plaza; una excelentísima, para nada barata y para nada forzada escena de empoderamiento femenino.\nA pesar de todo lo anteriormente mencionado, Avengers: Endgame continúa en el trayecto de la grandeza homérica y de las ambiciones 'fitzcarraldeanas' y nos regala un momento único en la historia de la cinematografía mundial, y definitivamente de los mejores que hemos visto: La escena del pegaso. La osadía de Anthony y Joe Russo tras las cámaras y de las plumas de Markus y McFeely permiten al espectador disfrutar de un momento inigualable, completamente definitorio para el Universo Cinematográfico en su entereza; uno no puede más que agradecer a la mente visionaria y trascendental de Kevin Feige por habernos permitido presenciar este nivel de talento narrativo y fílmico, logrando cristalizar años y años de avance cultural en una escena extraordinaria. Quizás, pero un leve quizás, sólo se podría mejorar a esta película si cada personaje tuviera un pegaso, ya que ¿que no es el pegaso la representación de la capacidad imaginativa de las personas, que nos permiten volar desde la comodidad de una silla o con la compañía de un ser querido? ¿acaso no nos transporta este noble corcel mágico a esos momentos especiales, cálidos ingenuos y sencillos, de nuestra niñez?\n¡Hurra por Avengers: Endgame, que es todo esto y mucho más!

If you were to tell me in the year 2007 that there would be a movie that you would love so much and people will be talking about it day in day I would've probably not cared that much. Yeah I was more into Thomas the Tank Engine back then so I probably wouldn't have cared as much. But this movie was great though. Avengers: Endgame is the combination of 11 years of storytelling. All stories weaving in together to have one epic payoff. And man the payoff was worth it! From Cap vs Cap. To Romanoff's death to Cap being worthy to just everything! I mean seriously. I think Avengers: Endgame is the only movie that needed to have just one trailer. Also this has to be the best example of character development that I've seen on film. And while Tony's death was the one we might have seen coming. No one could've predicted Natasha's death. And no one could've predicted Captain America saying Avengers Assemble. They might have been hoping for it but they couldn't predicted it or saw it coming. I could talk endlessly about Avengers: Endgame but for now I'm just going to give it a 10/10.",

My favorite being the \"ultra feminist\" moment when they isolated the ladies to one part of the battlefield...for some reason...and they all charged in together.

            "content": "This is easily the biggest movie of the century so far. That doesn't mean its the best superhero movie, but Avengers: Endgame is the culmination of over 11 years of buildup and the ultimate payoff. It is currently the highest grossing film in existence, and it certainly earned it. Endgame is more than a movie, its a comic book event, that will likely be remembered for the ages. It will take a while before anyone can top this at such a grand scale. Endgame manages to pay off many great movies both in the movie and from the previous 21 movies. The best payoff was arguably Captain America summoning Mjolnir. In Avengers: Age of Ultron, everybody tried to lift Thor's hammer at a party, but most of them failed. When Cap tried to lift the hammer, he budged it and was able to lift it but chose not to. However, in Endgame, Cap finally summoned Thor's hammer and when that shot happened, the whole theater erupted. It was such an amazing moment. Endgame is also a counterpart to Infinity War in many ways. They showcase the same themes throughout both movies.  However, the best comparison between the two movies was the scenes on Vormir. In Infinity War, Thanos learns that in order to get the soul stone, he has to sacrifice something that he loves. The only person Thanos loves is his daughter, Gamora. Thanos does not even hesitate to sacrifice his own daughter, the only person he loves, in order to achieve his goal to wipe out half of all life in the universe. In contrast, when Hawkeye and Black Widow receive the same news, their reactions are almost the opposite. Neither of them are willing to let the other one sacrifice themselves to save everyone. Both Natasha and Clint are willing to make the sacrifice, but both don't want the other to do it. In fact, they even have a fight to see who would die. In the end, Black Widow ends up making the sacrifice in a death scene that most of us didn't expect. Infinity War shows a villain at his worst, while Endgame shows heroes at their best. Endgame also did a perfect job concluding the character arcs of the characters that we've known and loved for up to over a decade, namely those of Black Widow, Captain America, and Iron Man. Black Widow has spent her whole life fighting, lying, and even killing for evil organizations. She tries to help people because she feels that she needs to redeem herself. In The Avengers, she said \"I've got red in my ledger, and I'd like to wipe it out.\" She thought by working for SHIELD, she was redeeming herself, but then we find out that SHIELD was really HYDRA. In The Winter Soldier, Black Widow says: \"I thought I knew who's lies I was telling, but I guess I just traded in the KGB for HYDRA.\" After the snap, Natasha has spent the last 5 years doing everything to try to bring everyone that she lost back. After Infinity War, the defeat had hit her personally. She never had any family but the Avengers, so she had nothing else to do but continue the job. Black Widow was the one that was never able to move on from the snap, because she had nothing else. She spent her whole time trying to continue to keep the world safe even in an post-apocalyptic era. Her sacrifice in Avengers: Endgame was a perfect conclusion. If they didn't get the stone, half the universe would stay dead, and everything she had done for the last 5 years would all be for nothing. Clint had a family, and if he died, he would never get to see them again. If she died, she would be dying FOR her family, to save it. For her, this was also the only way to redeem herself for her past actions by saving everyone. The relationship between Natasha and Clint is also handled perfectly. In The Avengers, Black Widow mentions that Hawkeye was sent to kill her, but he made a different call and saved her. Ever since she feels like she owes him. This is perfectly called back in Endgame, after Hawkeye has gone insane after his family was killed by Thanos, the other remaining Avengers don't want anything do with him and Rhodey even says that he shouldn't be found. Like Clint did for her many years before, she finds Clint and convinces him to help them. This time, Clint is the one that's dangerous, and Natasha is the one that has to save him from himself. So when they're both on the cliff in Endgame, there is a perfect callback when Clint thought that he deserved to die because of what he did over the last 5 years. Natasha responds saying that she doesn't judge people by their worst mistakes and Clint says that maybe she should. Natasha responds saying: \"You didn't.\" These few lines sum up their entire relationship perfectly. Finally, she decides that it needs to be her to make the sacrifice so that Clint can get back to his family and half the universe comes back. By sacrificing herself, she finally paid her debt to Clint. He saved her life, and now she saved his. This was a perfect and well-thought out conclusion to Black Widow's arc. Next we have Captain America. Steve has always been a noble and selfless person. He always does what he knows is right, and sticks to his principles no matter what. Even if anyone and everyone is telling him do something wrong, he won't do it. Cap has been through plenty, and so for the last 5 years, hes been helping other people get over their grief. Cap has put his life on the line time after time to save other people, and still is not able to be happy. In the First Avenger, Captain America has to sacrifice himself by crashing a plane to save millions of lives. Because of this, he is not able to get that dance with Peggy Carter or the life he truly wanted. He ends up surviving by waking up 70 years later, but he sacrificed his happiness. In Age of Ultron, Tony said that he wanted to try having a normal life and a family and told Cap that he should try it one day. Cap said that the one who wanted that went in to the ice seventy years ago and someone different came out. In Endgame, when Cap goes to visit Tony Stark, he sees the family life he has with his wife and daughter. Cap didn't realize it, but its exactly what he wants. So at the end of the movie, Cap realizes that there is a way for him to have his life that he wants. He finally does something in his own self-interest and not to protect others. Cap goes back in time, returns the stones, and finally gets the dance that he's been wanting for over 75 years. It was a sweet ending, and it was earned. Finally, we have Iron Man. Tony Stark is arguably the central character of the MCU and he was the one who started everything with 2008's Iron Man. Tony starts off as a self-obsessed arrogant asshole who takes no accountability or responsibility for his actions. He doesn't care about all the horrible things his company has done or all the lives that have been taken because of him. However, his life changes forever after he was kidnapped by terrorists in a cave in Afghanistan. He realizes that his own weapons are being sold to terrorists, who use his weapons to take tens of thousands of lives. He and Ho Yinsen make a plan to escape, and Yinsen helps Tony build his first Iron Man suit. However, Yinsen dies helping Stark in the escape from the cave. As he died, he said the words that would change Tony's life forever: \"Don't waste your life.\" For the first time in his life, Tony thanks someone else for helping him. After his escape, Tony realizes that he is responsible for his company selling those weapons to terrorists, and that it is his responsibility to stop this. First, Tony shuts down his weapons manufacturing division of his company. Then, he creates the Iron Man suit and destroys all of his weapons that the terrorists are using. This combination of his guilt for the lives hes destroyed and his responsibility to protect anyone else from being harmed are Tony's driving factors. His guilt only amplifies when in Avengers: Age of Ultron, when by trying to protect the world, he creates Ultron, who almost destroys the whole planet. Tony also has an internal conflict, in which he is unable to stop being Iron Man. This conflict was demonstrated in Iron Man 3 and at the end of Age of Ultron, where he retired and tried to stop being Iron Man. But, in Civil War, Tony admits to Cap that even though he knows he should stop being Iron Man, he doesn't want to, because he feels like all the bad things that have been happening in the world are his fault, and the weight of his guilt over all those years is still weighing down on him. In Age of Ultron, Tony had a vision of all the Avengers dead except for him and a massive alien army invading Earth. In this vision, Tony sees that they died because he couldn't do more to protect them. Tony does get the chance of becoming a father with Peter Parker. He recruits Peter in Civil War and takes him under his wing. Their relationship is demonstrated perfectly in Homecoming and Infinity War as they evolve from mentor and student to father and son. So during the snap in Infinity War, when Peter dies in Tony's arms, Tony feels like its his fault, because he couldn't protect him. After this, Tony thinks hes going to die drifting off into space, and he tries to send a message to Pepper telling her that he's sorry that they weren't able to start a family. After he is rescued however, he realizes that there's no going back and that the only way to protect the people he loves is to not be Iron Man. He and Pepper have a kid and happily live on a farm. Tony finally gets the perfect life he wanted. This is why when Captain America and the other Avengers come to him to ask for his help to reverse the snap, Tony refuses. The snap gave him the best 5 years of his life, and he was not willing to give that up in order to bring back half the universe. He is now responsible for protecting his family, and helping the Avengers will only harm his family. However, Tony stumbles across a picture of Peter Parker, who had died in his arms 5 years ago. He still feels responsible for Peter's death, and realizes that by not helping to save the universe, he was also abandoning his surrogate son and allowing him to stay dead. He remembers his guilt and feeling of responsibility, and knows that he has no choice but to help save everyone, even if it means that he has to give up everything. Pepper understands how he feels and allows him to do it, knowing that Tony won't be able to rest if he doesn't. During the time heist, Tony finally gets to talk to his father, who he's always had a rocky relationship with. It was only now, after he became a father that he understood some of the things his father had done, and that Howard would do anything for him. At the end of the final battle of Endgame, Tony realizes what he has to do. In Infinity War, Dr. Strange had told him that out of 14 million outcomes, they only won in one outcome. Just minutes ago, Strange also told Tony that if he told him what happened, it wouldn't happen. Now, Thanos was putting the gauntlet on and everyone else near him was knocked out. Tony finally realizes what the one outcome was and what he had to save everyone from dying again. 15 years ago, in Iron Man, after Pepper told him he was going to kill himself trying to save people, Tony said: \"I shouldn't be alive, unless it was for a reason. I just finally know what I have to do.\" Now Tony knew the reason he was still alive. Tony Stark made the ultimate sacrifice and saved everyone in the end. With his final words, he said the same words that started it all: \"I am Iron Man.\" Tony's arc came full circle here. It was sad, but very fulfilling and true to the character. After Logan's death in Logan (2017), I didn't think any superhero's death could be sadder. But Endgame proved me wrong, as I actually kinda cried at Iron Man's death. The funeral scene was a perfect tribute of the entire MCU cast of heroes paying tribute to the one who started it all and in the end, saved them all. And the cherry on top was Pepper's original gift to Tony from Iron Man on the wreath that said \"Proof that Tony Stark has a heart.\" Endgame also took characters that were previously boring and uninteresting and turned them into compelling and interesting characters. The most improved player was Hawkeye. Hawkeye was not that interesting in any movie before (except maybe a bit in Age of Ultron) and wasn't even in Infinity War. But he was really good in Endgame. Hawkeye was the one grounded in reality and he was the one hit personally by the snap. While people like Captain America were grieved that they couldn't save the whole universe, Hawkeye was mad that he just couldn't save his own family. We see his rage, pain, and loss, and his interactions with most of the team, especially with Black Widow was often really powerful. I didn't at all care for Nebula in the Guardians movies and she wasn't there much in Infinity War. But now, she finally got her own arc. Nebula has to confront her past self, and decide to choose between who she was, and who she is. Her interactions with past Gamora and Past Nebula, especially now that she knows that Gamora did care about her, are really interesting, and her decision to save Gamora and kill her past self, albeit confusing how she doesn't die too, has started to feel like her defining moment. I have mixed opinions about Thor. He was much better in Ragnarok and Infinity War than he was in Endgame, but he wasn't. I thought the whole Thor being depressed was pretty good, and it seemed like the most logical thing that would happen after Infinity War, and Chris Hemsworth showcases his talent so well as one second he's laughing and making jokes and the next, he's sad and broken. The Thor and Rocket duo still works, but is handled much better in Infinity War. I also thought the redemption of Thor was a pretty good arc and the conversation with his mother was a great addition. But I don't like how his physique is used as a joke throughout the whole movie. It worked the first few times, but then it just got irritating. Also, Ragnarok and Infinity War showed his power growing stronger and stronger, and now hes just nerfed into oblivion in Endgame. I know it was necessary, or else he would've just soloed Thanos, but it still felt like a huge downgrade. Overall, Thor was handled pretty well. Kind of like Thor, I have mixed opinions on Hulk. I started by liking Professor Hulk, then not, liking it, and then it sort of grew on me. Of course, the problem is we wont see any true Hulk action, and I really wished they'd actually show us how Banner combined himself and Hulk. I did like his character overall though, and the scene where Professor Hulk snaps his fingers is awesome. Endgame also does a great job of showcasing how people go through grief. Black Widow is in denial and is still stuck in the past, trying to not believe that what happened in Infinity War happened and there's not much they can do about it. She is unable to move on because she has nothing else. Hawkeye is in anger. He saw what Thanos did to his family and has never gotten over it. After his family died, Hawkeye goes on an insane killing spree trying to make the world feel his pain. Hulk is trying to figure things out. He hasn't completely gone past the fact that he lost twice, but he's been trying to figure out what to do with himself after the fact. Hulk is trying to move on to other things to forget about his grief. One thing he did was to merge himself with Hulk to create Professor Hulk. Thor is in depression. He, more than anyone feels responsible for the trillions of people that died in Infinity War. He was the one that had a shot at killing Thanos, and has never forgiven himself for his decision out of pride to declare to Thanos that he, Thor killed him and fulfilled his brothers promise, instead of going for the head and killing Thanos straight away preventing all these deaths. Thor already lost his mother, his father, his sister, his home, half his people, his best friend, and his brother. Being responsible for the deaths of half of the universe was the last straw. On top of that, he also found out that there was no hope for him to undo his actions because Thanos destroyed the Infinity Stones, and Thor killed the Mad Titan in cold blood, chopping off his head two days late. Because of this, Thor goes completely wacko and spends his days playing Fortnite with Korg and Miek and drinking tons of beer. Tony is in acceptance. Tony has accepted what happened in Infinity War, and he has completely moved on. He now lives on a ranch with Pepper, and they have a young girl named Morgan. Tony is no longer still affected by his grief, and his life is now completely different. And finally, we have Steve. Steve isn't stuck in any of these stages, and he gets over his grief by helping others get over theirs. He's a grief counselor, as he's been through so much sadness even before Infinity War, that even though he may not be able to move on, he's able to help others get past their grief. Now I do have some issues with the movie. I do think the time travel is a bit confusing, especially with Nebula at several times, and I do think that the humor can be misplaced at times. But that's about it. And as for the latter of my issues, the humor isn't as misplaced as most humor in movies in general. In short, Avengers: Endgame can be divided into three parts, each about an hour each. The first hour is a character study, the second hour is a time heist, and the third hour is the final battle. Now we move on to the best part of the movie: the entire final battle. Wow! I have never seen anything as epic as this battle on screen before. The final battle in Endgame is filled with plenty of action, tons of amazing moments, and of course the most iconic scene in comic book movie history. The only part of the final battle that I didn't absolutely love or wasn't completely shaken by the sheer spectacularity of the battle was the forced in girlpower moment. I didn't hate it like many people do, and it didn't completely take me out of the movie, but I just thought it was way, way, way too convenient that all the female heroes were in one exact spot at the exact same time during such a massive battle and it feels like it was forced into the movie. We start off with an amazing fight that everyone has been waiting for. The Big Three, the trio of the the franchise are all back together, going against Thanos, the big bad of the entire MCU. Thanos's speech to the heroes was so intimidating and awesome: \"You could not live with your own failure. Where did that bring you? Back to me.\" This Thanos is a step down from Infinity War Thanos, but it makes sense, considering that he saw that people would not be grateful to him for what he did, and is was a younger, more brash Thanos. Thanos is still a really threatening villain, and it somehow manages to up the stakes even higher than Infinity War. One, because we saw what happened in Infinity War, and we saw the massive effects it had everywhere. Two, because now, hes going to destroy the entire universe and recreate it. The action is awesome, and once again shows the chemistry and teamwork between the fighters, for example, when Thor uses his lightning to supercharge Iron Mans suit. But, the best part of this fight comes when Thanos is about to kill Thor, and then Mjolnir lifts off the ground and knocks Thanos at the head, and the hammer rebounds flying into the hands of Captain America! Cap did really well against Thanos, but Thanos still manages to get the upper hand. Cap is utterly defeated, with his shield broken and lying on the ground. Then Thanos reveals his entire invading army, a mix of Chitauri, Leviathians, Outriders, and the Black Order. This was Tony's vision of the Endgame. Cap's shield was broken, Black Widow was dead, an alien army was ready to invade Earth, and nobody was left to stop them. That is exactly what Tony saw in Age of Ultron in his vision. Even though it was a hopeless match, Captain America would never give up. This is another moment that truly shows us that no matter what happens, Captain America will always stand back up to fight until he is literally destroyed and 100% dead. Single-handedly marching towards Thanos and his entire army to stand up to them is saying: \"I can do this all day,\" without actually saying it. Steve is still that kid from Brooklyn who stood up to the bully in that alley, and this time, the bully is Thanos and his army. The visual shots of Captain America summoning Thor's hammer and of him walking with a broken shield straight into Thanos's army, ready to fight them all are some of the best visual effects ever. And now, we get to the most epic, most iconic, the GOAT of all epic scenes. Right when Steve thinks its all over, he suddenly hears a voice. The words sound somewhat familiar. He's heard them before, about 9 years ago: \"On your left.\" It was Sam. Right on his left, a portal opens, and out of it comes ... Black Panther, followed by Okoye and Shuri. T'Challa nods at Steve, ready to fight. Suddenly the soundtrack kicks in as Falcon flies in overhead. Then, on another side opens another portal, this one from Titan and we see Dr. Strange, the Master of the Mystic Arts himself, who planned this all. Along with him are Star-Lord, Drax, Mantis, and finally Spider-Man. Cap smiles and sighs, rejoicing. Portals open everywhere and everyone comes through. The New Asgardians from New Asgard, the Ravagers from their various planets, and Wong and all the Sorcerers from around the world. M'Baku and the entire Wakandan army follow out along with Bucky and Groot. Wasp flies in as well, and Scarlet Witch drops in from above. Nebula, Hawkeye, and Gamora re-enter the battle as well. Just when we think they're all here, Ant-Man grows to 100 feet tall and drops of Professor Hulk, War Machine, and Rocket. Shocked and stunned, Thor and Iron Man get back up as well. Then the music switches back to the classic Avengers theme, but so much more epic this time. From six heroes circling up to defend the city, it had now become a whole army of heroes defending the Universe. Cap sees what's happened and now has a determined look on his face ready to lead everyone into battle. As the music continues, The Avengers all get ready to fight. Summoning the hammer again, Cap says the iconic line in the most epic and satisfying way possible. \"Avengers ... Assemble.\" It all goes crazy from there. The main Avengers theme starts as all the heroes charge into battle. I have never seen anything like this in any movie to this scale. I will always remember seeing Endgame in the theater for the first time. It's an experience I wish I could relive. Avengers: Endgame was the best and most memorable time I've ever had in any theater and I don't know if any film will ever top this experience, and this scene is probably a main reason why. I've grown up watching these characters and finally seeing them all throw down like this was just insane. The ending of Avengers: Endgame is near perfect. The funeral for Tony Stark was the best possible tribute to him and Tony's self-made eulogy is heartbreaking and loving at the same time. And of course, we will never forget, \"I love you 3000.\" All the original Avengers have reached their conclusion and their story is at its close. Avengers: Endgame was the end of an era, and it sure ended it in style. And of course, the final closing for the original 6 Avengers was the credits scene. My God, I have never seen the Credits leave so much impact. but they do in Endgame, not just because its the last one, but the way they are structured makes us feel like we're at the end. We slowly see all the heroes and their actors one by one, and when we finally get to the original 6, the music changes. We see the characters and their scenes in the background one by one, and with their name, comes their signature. Jeremy Renner, Scarlet Johannson, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, and finally Robert Downey Jr.",

            "content": "EDIT** After rewatching 2 years later, I think Endgame has aged well and I added a half star to make it 4.5/5. Now that I already know the story choices they make (even if I don't love them all), the quality of this movie stands out more to me. The human drama is at the best it has ever been in the MCU- and particularly the first half takes time to slow things down with tons of character moments that feel very earned. The actors all give their best performances, and I found myself enjoying the small scenes of emotional dialogue perhaps even more than the big action moments (although those are blast too). \n\nEndgame is an extremely well made film, but for me it falls short of being a perfect conclusion and follow-up to the highs reached by Infinity War. Endgame ends up being an emotional, slow-burn the majority of the story, leaving most of the spectacle for the final act. My main problems with Endgame come down to the story. **SPOILERS** A couple issues I had include: \n1. Hulk becomes Professor Hulk offscreen, probably the biggest development his character has had in the entire course of the MCU happens in a throwaway line of dialogue played for comedic effect. Then he is sidelined the rest of the movie and is virtually absent in the final battle despite being a flagship marvel character. Most disappointing was Hulk not getting the rematch with Thanos he seemed obviously set up for in Infinity War. \n2. Iron Man once again dominates the storyline, being the one who both solves time travel (conveniently and after almost no effort) and ultimately snaps Thanos and company out of existence. It's not that I don't like his character, it's just that I want to feel like the MCU is bigger than this one character, he takes the spotlight in all 4 Avenger movies, his own trilogy, and plays a major role in Civil War, Homecoming, and Far from Home. Everything has to revolve around Tony while other interesting and more powerful characters get sidelined. \n3. Time travel seemed like a convenient cop out for the writers to solve the story. Something unbelievably terrible happens so our heroes solve it with time travel. Terminator, X-men Days of Future Past, Looper, Deadpool 2- we've seen it so many times. After Infinity War's dramatic ending I guess I was hoping for something a bit more original and creative to fix the snap. \n4. The final battle doesn't carry the same weight and intensity of the Wakanda charge. Part of this is the fully CGI setting and part is that by the time all heroes show up we know victory is inevitable. Even though we know they will win, it would carry more weight if they left some uncertainty/suspense all the way through the battle's end (think of the intensity of the final moments at the Black Gate battle at ROTK). It really comes down to Tony, Thor, and Captain fighting Thanos, and everything else just feels like a nice background rather than a true fight to the death between two armies. \n5. Fat Thor was funny at first, but it overstayed its welcome. Infinity War perfected his character, balancing Thor's comedic side with the fact that he is still a formidable warrior on a quest for vengeance. Instead Thor remains a punchline throughout the Endgame, which was really a letdown considering how badass he was in IW. IW starts with Thor getting his ass kicked by Thanos, and ends with him redeeming himself by coming back more powerful than ever to bury his axe in Thanos' chest. Now we have him reverting back to becoming an overweight loser getting his ass kicked by Thanos, which makes his overall arc less satisfying. \n\nAll that being said this is still a very good movie. The visuals, directing, acting, cinematography, and soundtrack are all fantastic. It wraps up many loose ends of the MCU while still leaving many other stories to be told, I just was left slightly disappointed by several story elements.",

            "content": "There can be only so many of those franchise spanning sprawling epic kind of films.\n\nNot that the Russo brothers don't know how to pull it off; the directing team have already proven their astounding capacity to handle a veritable menagerie of super-beings thrown in into a tapestry of increasingly complex plot-lines since they directed CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER back in 2014. While this film presented a fascinating spy drama plot delving into a vast conspiracy shaking the foundations of S.H.I.E.L.D. all the while exploring Captain America's survivor's guilt, the following 2 films, 2016's CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR, and last year's AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR, steered clear of character developments to focus on bringing bigger and bigger spectacles putting a growing number of heroes in jeopardy.\n\nWith CIVIL WAR, INFINITY WAR and now AVENGERS ENDGAME, Anthony and Joe Russo have successfully upped the ante and they have, beyond all expectations, managed to win with flying colors.\n\nThe film has its limited appeal (although the MCU series' amazing profitability seems to warrant such a gamble) ;  it will make most sense to the fans who have seen most of the previous films in the series, very much like it was the case with INFINITY WAR, but even more so, as the plot requires to have a good knowledge of the previous films, not only to fully appreciate the references, but to fully care for characters that shows up onscreen for often less than a minute. Granted, some appearances, albeit short, can pack quite a wallop, and the script by MCU veterans Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely manages to adroitly unravel so much drama, humor and action in the epic 3 hour long duration of the movie that you sometimes are left with no time to ponder on the brevity of some sub-plots.\n\nThere is a multitude of such fascinating turns in the story that would deserve their own movie by themselves, and that may indeed feed the plots for upcoming installments of some of the solo stories to come, but are left as mere teases, just enough to provide information, but not quite enough for the emotion to fully hits. One such example is Scott Lang (Ant-Man, played with effortless charm by Paul Rudd) returning home after vanishing for 5 years in the Quantum Realm. Discovering a land wounded by Thanos' (a superb Josh Brolin) world-shattering snap, where half of the world's population was turned to dust, leaving the survivors battered and weary, still reeling under the shock of the loss of their loved ones. When Lang comes home, he is met with the results of his long absence, which in itself might have deserved more screen time. But then again, as stated, the film is already clocking at 3 hours, and there is barely anything that should be cut in the first place.\n\nThis is not to say that the film is all sound and fury with nary an emotion to be felt. In fact the beginning of the film has a poignant melancholy to it, where the surviving heroes from ''the snap'' are still reeling from the ultimate defeat from the last film. And there is still plenty of humor to be found, including Chris Hemsworth's increasingly comedic interpretation of Thor, which was the highlight of THOR: RAGNAROK by Taika Waititi 2 years ago. I'm not certain his deconstruction of the God of Thunder will please longtime fans, but he, alongside Mark Ruffalo's Hulk, provides most of the laughs in the film.\n\nBut as was the case in the previous films by the Russo Brothers, the emotional center of the film is definitely Captain America and Iron Man, who benefits from the deepest characterization and some of the best scenes from the film. Robert Downey's Tony Stark has been the linchpin of the MCU ever since Jon Favreau's IRON MAN in 2008, and his character stands in the film as the one with the most to lose if he returns to the fray in a desperate attempt to save the World once again from the threat of Thanos. And Steve Rogers, beautifully portrayed by an earnest Chris Evans, will have the crowd cheering in one of the most fan-pleasing scene I've seen in years, which had me yell ''Oh yeah!'' in the theater.\n\nThe film is not perfect, of course. No film really is. The pacing can be all over the place, and it can leave a lot of questions unanswered. But it never leaves you much time to ponder. Some moments can be predictable, but some moments can be completely, utterly shocking. But it is a perfect wrap-up of this first 11 years of Marvel movies, bringing fun, thrills, and a fair amount of tears in its wake.\n\n But after all the insane magnitude of these crossover story-lines, I am hoping for a bit of a break. Don't get me wrong; I am glad to see the saga of the Infinity Stones draw to a close and have enjoyed the ride. But I hope it takes a few films before we are taken on another one of those franchise-spanning saga. Like a roller coaster ride, it can be tremendously exciting  yet exhausting.",

            "content": "Avengers: Endgame, directed once again by the Russo Brothers, was one of the most memorable films I've ever seen, being the best movie theater experience I've ever had! The Russo Brothers gathered everyone together, one last time, to go out with an absolute bang, but it didn't come without a few flaws. The premise of the film had it's tropes, but due to the great amount of heart, powerful themes, emotion and tention, it kept things moving forward, with great energy! Although there are so many memorable scenes, all of the content they tried to squeeze in, set up for a lot of plot gaps, conveniences, and nitpicks, but nothing completely threw me out of the film. Similar to Infinity War, the way the Russo Brothers structured the scenes, didn't make for the best flowing narrative, creating too much filler, in order to hit that three hour mark. They tried to incorporate almost everything that we've learned in the past, creating a lot of fan service moments, throwing the pace and focus of the film off. The Russo Brothers seemed to have had a tough time trying to balance all of the tones, where at some moments, they play off eachother nicely, and some other times, it can almost take you out of the film.\n\nIt's crazy that, after twenty-two films, the creative team is still finding ways to flesh out, and develop our characters! Even though there are a few questionable character archs given to some of our heroes, you still have to give credit to the creative team, for doing something new, while still keeping the comics relevant. There are so many great character moments in this film, and I'd honestly go as far as saying that, it had just as many, if not, a few more moments than Infinity War. Markus and McFeely did a great job grounding everyone's character, giving everyone a well understood motive, that the audience can create an emotional bond with. This was by far the most emotional film of the Infinity Saga, but, by every character bringing their A-game to the set, it brings the emotions up to an eleven. One of the main issues I had with the characters, on the side of some of the archs, is the balancing. As said before, it's going to be tough to balance all of this talent on screen at once, but they created a better situation for themselves, and didn't quite capitalize on it.\n\nGiven for the amount of content they had to put into form, the screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, was pretty good. They created a lot of memorable pieces of dialogue, while balancing the comedy better this time around. The only issues I had with the script, was some ideas and characters went a little underdeveloped; other than that, this was a pretty well written script.\n\nThe action of this film was off the walls! Though it can get a little sloppy, and convenient at times, they still managed to craft these amazing, high octane action sequences, including the most memorable and known sequence of all superhero films!\n\nOverall, there are more than a few notable issues with this film, but I just really enjoy Avengers: Endgame! I wouldn't go as far as saying that it belongs at the top of your list, but it definitely belongs around the top ten!",

For instance Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, Chris Hemsworth as Thor , Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange or my favorite actor Chris Evans as Captain America and many others well-known actors.\nThe plot of the film is quite predictable. The main villain is, of course, Thanos, like in the previous part. He was killed by Thor, but returned to finish his idea of killing half of the galaxy with the help of six infinity stones. Therefore only Avengers can stop him, but there are only half of them. Why? You should probably know from the previous part.\nThis part of Avengers is not so funny. It was more about relationships and understanding problems between Avengers, for example when Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark invents a time machine and helps half of Avengers return to the past and find the infinity stones. But the script and plot are still not boring and there are a lot of impressive moments and spectacular scenes, like the final battle scene. This scene is the best one which I have ever seen. But for me the most memorable scene was when Iron Man takes infinity stones from Thanos, uses it and says \"And I… am…. IRON MAN\" and snaps his fingers…\nTo sum up, Brothers Russo have created one of the best action and grossing film ever. I think that this film has something for everyone. So don't miss it!",

            "content": "This film both exceeded my expectations and unfortunately left me with a mixed bag to pick at. I'm first going to delve deep into the positives of this film, because boy are there a bunch to pick from. First off, the cast in this film are absolutely incredible, Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Paul Rudd, Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson etc. everyone was great. It was so breathtaking to see all of my favourite heroes finally coming together to battle one last time, for now anyway. The score was perfectly composed by the great Alan Silvestri as it holds one of the most memorable MCU score tracks to date, 'Portals'. The CGI Team did an amazing job because this film looks visually stunning. The fight scenes are amazingly choreographed so hats off to the choreography team for doing such a great job. \n\nNow like all films, they have their flaws, and this film definitely has its fair share of them. First off, this film was all about undoing the events that occurred in Infinity War, so that already makes you guess at what is to be expected. Because at the end of Infinity War, our Heroes lost together for the very first time, they failed. Endgame was pretty much a way of telling people \"Oh hey its okay the remaining Avengers will figure out a way to fix this and everyone will live happily ever after\" making Infinity War's ending less impactful, for me anyway. But, with fixing the damage, comes big consequences for our Heroes, and there are definitely a lot of consequences for them in Endgame, which makes the film more or less worthwhile in the end. \n\nSo all in all, this film packs in pretty much everything you would expect in a grand finale of a universe, 11 years in the making. So I highly recommend this film as it is a really fun and entertaining film to watch with some very awesome and memorable moments you will have stuck in your head for a long time. \n\nEnjoy!",

            "content": "Over the last 11 years, Marvel Studios has built a franchise unlike anything the movie world has ever seen before. More than just launching an incredible run of multiple series that each center on unique characters and establish their own specific aesthetics, they've also maintained an immensely complex continuity that expands with each new story. Every filmmaker who contributes to the universe adds a new piece to the puzzle, carving out something different and diverse that is also crafted to add to the bigger picture.\n\nWithin this approach there are gradients, and it results in two basic kinds of Marvel Studios films. On one side you have titles like Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Guardians Of The Galaxy, which find their own corner of the expansive world and use that specific real estate for relatively contained storytelling. On the other side there are titles like The Avengers and Captain America: Civil War, which are designed with the entire scope of the franchise in mind, and utilize specific details and elements of the larger continuity to create something both reflective and new.\n\nAs tremendous and exceptional as the movies in the former category can be (and that's pretty extreme), it's those in the latter that make the Marvel Cinematic Universe truly special. Simply making a cogent and entertaining blockbuster is a ridiculous challenge all by itself, so you'd think that simultaneously incorporating the massive details of multiple other massive films would be practically impossible. And yet, the studio has been successful time and time again.\n\nThis brings us to Joe and Anthony Russo's Avengers: Endgame – a film that has been specifically described over the last four-and-a-half years as the movie that would be the ultimate capstone for the franchise, and exist as the story to which all of the previous 21 chapters have been leading. Obviously that's an incredible amount of hype, and the end result is that it's now considered one of the most anticipated releases in history… but what's even more utterly spectacular is the fact that every ounce of that hype is totally justified.\n\nSimply put, Avengers: Endgame is one of the most ambitious, entertaining, emotional, and stunning blockbusters we've ever seen, and the best film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe canon thus far.",

Finally the ending brought back all the characters we know and love to take down the villain they have been hyping up for years to be the avengers final showdown.

Temos Fan Services que funcionam muito bem, batalhas épicas e homenagens a toda a historia da fase no cinema. Temos diversas cenas de puro dialogo, o que nos aproxima muito dos personagens. As atuações estão muito boas - você sente que a maioria dos atores se encontraram ali. A OST é de arrepiar e a fotografia estonteante. \n\nDe longe, esse é o filme mais emocionante da saga. Com tantos diálogos, emoções, medo, sacrifícios e surpresas, é normal se encontrar chorando numa cena ou outra. Inclusive, o final belíssimo é um presente não só para o Steve Rogers como para os amantes do amor. \n\nAvengers: Endgame tem uma conclusão histórica, com um dos planos mais ambiciosos já feitos. Toda homenagem feita a sua trajetória, aos personagens e aos fans é emocionante, e não importa quantas vezes o veja, tu vai se emocionar!",

Some may argue it's just a fan service movie but that's what it's meant to be and it earned it. It's meant to be a reward for those who've been fans of the MCU and I'm so happy with what we got.

I love the character of Iron Man that Marvel has created and the journey that he has been through to get to this moment and the end. It is my favorite ending in all of cinema it paid off the most of any movie in my opinion because he has had such a journey from the first Iron Man and in the scene when he talks to Yinsen he says \"Don't waste your life\" and he follows that from Iron Man to Endgame and he lives by that rule.\n\nI love the special effects every effect looks so lifelike and Thanos even the wrinkles in on his forehead look lifelike and they move like they would if they were real. I loved the score in the movie and I wish it got nominated for best score at the Oscars the score just elevates the movie and in one very important scene, in the end, it plays and it just makes it so much better. One thing people never talk about when they are talking about marvel movies is the acting I think they had some pretty good performances in this movie and I wouldn't mind if RDJ got nominated but he didn't I'm not complaining though. They make each character pay off in the end like Black Widow, Captain America, and Iron Man most of all. They just bring us through this journey with them and we get to see what they have become and what they do. This is one of the movies besides Logan and Infinity War that I have cried in and that really makes this movie so much better. And there are some WOAH moments in this movie that even after watching it twice still WOW me. I think that the story is very good it kept me on the edge of my seat wanting to learn more about their plan and how they are going to execute it, it is three hours long run but I never felt like it was too long or it dragged and if someone does it still is very enjoyable. You could say they didn't do the time travel part well but time travel it very tricky and confusing in many movies it would be hard to try and explain time travel but I think they did the time travel part well to the best of their abilities. Overall I absolutely loved this movie and I would recommend it to anyone.\n💯%",

It's a massive film, filled with amazing visual effects, tons of fan service, great action sequences, and a terrific sendoff for a beloved character. 'I am Iron Man' will forever be immortalized as the most badass superhero moment in the entire MCU, bar none. Once again, the Russo brothers did a fantastic job balancing tone throughout the film. Despite the gloom that completely enveloped the first 30 minutes or so of the film, they managed to add in a few lighthearted moments that set the stage for future tonal shifts in the film. I felt the humor was welcomed and, at times, downright hilarious. Steve Rogers v. Steve Rogers is a moment most soon won't forget. And that is most definitely America's ass (trademark). However, though the fan service was excellent, it severely detracts from the re-watch potential of the film. I was surprised, elated, and emotionally fulfilled from my first watch-through and the countless fan service moments will never have that same impact upon re-watching the movie (which is why I will likely never watch it again). The emotional moments were fully earned and I cried in the theater (it was the cheeseburger line), something that rarely happens to me. After 10 years of watching these characters grow and interact with one another, I felt that the arcs for Tony and Steve were perfect in every which way. Also, I'm proud to say that I predicted the final shots of the film between Peggy and Steve and I still get chills thinking about it. The Russo brothers created the perfect culminating film for the MCU but unfortunately, the over-abundance of fan-service makes this an impossible film to enjoy more than once and for me, detracts from the overall score. Nevertheless, this is still a great MCU film and the Russos have more than earned their rest.",

It's hard telling exactly what will happen next when it comes to the future success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but it's likely not going to top the current momentum for a while, if ever. Overall, the film has a fairly complex yet understandable storyline and is pretty unpredictable at times.

Antman was funny, as always. Tony's death was touching, even though he's my least favorite character for a lot of reasons. Overall, would I watch this again? My answer is a definitive no. There were more things wrong with this movie than there were right. I'm pretending the last ten minutes didn't happen. That Captain America didn't turn into a selfish jerk and go back to the past, forcing Peggy to choose him. He still could have retired without resorting to running away. The best thing to come out of this movie is the Falcon and Winter Soldier television show. Will never see anything by the Russo brothers again because of how bad they screwed up so many characters.",

For a casual viewer or a die hard Marvel fan, there is enjoyment for all. Not only does Avengers: Endgame (2019) pay off years of fan service which had been carefully crafted throughout the MCU's existence, but it does it in a way which felt both natural and proper.\n\nIn the many MCU movies up to this point, none had a longer duration than Avengers: Endgame (2019), but you only really feel that long runtime once the film is completed and you have time to reflect on the events you witnessed. Every character gets their moment, whether they are for the main characters like Steve Rogers and Tony Stark, or smaller ones like Nebula and Clint Barton.\n\nAvengers: Endgame (2019) is the perfect Marvel movie, beside the handling of Thor which may annoy some, however there is no doubt that this film deserves the stature of praise it has received. Delivering a roller coaster of emotions, from comedic laughs, rolling tears, to gasps of shock and screams of happiness, this film has it all.",

            "content": "You simply can't introduce time travel in the Final Episode. You can't undo all the deaths as if they were nothing; I did read a book about the history of Marvel comics where Stan Lee wanted to sell the illusion of change and while this is exactly that. I'm allowed to jot like the core idea of what Stan Lee wanted from Marvel. I side more with Jack Kirby on wanting my movies with real irreversible changes.\n\nIn some interview they tried to explain away the plotholes with the infamous phrase: \"A wizard did it\" from the Xhena parody Q&A from the Simpsons Tree House of Horror's Halloween episode.\n\nWhen it comes to Marvel crossover conclusions involving time travel; X-men Days of Future Past (specially the eXtentded Rogue Cut) is better than this. Also the Back to the Future this movie jokes about and tries to homage; is a thousand years better than this, Avengers Endgame is the Jaws XXII that Back to the Future II joked would happen in the future.\n\nMarvel has not only jumped the Shark; it has jumped the Fonzy as shown by the prequel Captain Marvel showing a fight on space above Fonzy merchandise. I don't understand why people aren't angry. But as someone who likes grounded movies i didn't liked this.\n\nThe way time travel is done; it tries to survive on nostalgia rather than earning a good story. I didn't liked most of the uneven MCU prequels; so this feels unearned. \n\nAlso the Hawkeye kids would of had been better orphan, than raised by a Punisher turned vengeful bloody cold killer Hawkeye father. The film sacrificed; and that's the thing, characters never face consequences. We never see what they learned, they just win because they had time-travel but they never overcome their personal flaws on the way the adult-kids from IT do (without overcoming any specific flaws; all characters are interchangeable and that makes the movie worse).\n\nThe worse example of characters not learning anything is Captain America, even if one simpatizes with him missing his girl that got away. Creating an alternative timeline to be with her is creepy and unethical; specially because she had already aged and died of natural causes; after having a life of her own. Is wrong, also I mean they altered some timelines which is wrong. Normal time travel mechanics would had been better. I don't know it feels like they won by cheating, because they won without personal growing up and maturing if feels unearned and hollow (Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith failure in comparison to the victory in VI: Return of the Jedi a great example of overcoming flaws and winning, even if JJ Abrams is such a bad writet that IX:Rise of Skywalker has the characters winning by doing the exact same things deemed as failures in the previous movies).\n\n2019 was a year of lackluster endings; part of the problem of reviving characters is that the \"death\" always feels fake. \n\nThe positive thing I can say is the acting is good, the MCU VFX designs have always been to cartoonish for my taste; even if the effects are good. I would say too much CGI. The worst part is that the generic debris was so generic that action was hard to follow; hard to know where anyone was standing and thus what was happening.\n\nI feel that the criticized Godzilla King of the Monster handled the envioremental storyline, which I feel should had been the core of this movie; so much better. The population measure control there is Godzilla and the deaths are permanent; accepted and the villian wins because the enviorement is shown less contaminated where Godzilla attacked. Godzilla justified the villian attack by saying human overpopulation causes contamination; whereas Thanos motivations get lost due to this Sequel forgetting them completely and turning him into a generic villian.",

The final battle is one of my favourite scenes in any movie as it takes all the characters we know and love (including Howard the Duck!) into one epic finale against one of the most iconic movie villains ever.

It's deeply sad throughout and people try to put a brave face on as you do, but grief is no slouch and it clearly takes constant work for them all just to buck up and rally around another one of sad-faced Captain America's many speeches. \nIt all culminates in the death of Iron Man and the eventual death of Captain America and both men get what they want. Lives without all this pain; The burden of responsibility and honour. When Stark dies it's quick but it feels earned, and when Potts leans in to him and allows him to go, he doesn't register anything on his face because he's dying. But you hope he registers it somewhere before he does. \nI'd need to see it again to appreciate the nuances and the Easter eggs but I was profoundly moved by watching these people (characters) we know well by now, in the kinds of pain we will all go through. And strangely it overtook my experience of the movie but not in a bad way. \n\nSo I gave it 5 stars. When I wash it clean from my mind and watch it again. I'll be able to assess its many levels, achievements and flaws. But as a film about loss. It's superbly layered and surprisingly effective and therefore I say it's pretty much succeeded on a human level.

The third act of this movie has you gripped and at the edge of your seat the whole time... all in all Avengers Endgame is a MASTERPIECE!!! and a more than satisfying conclusion to the 11 year epic journey the MCU has been on (the infinity saga). I have nothing negative to say about Avengers Endgame. there are a few things i personally would of changed throughout the movie but the movie is still a MASTERPIECE to me.

I can't quite say how happy I was that we didn't see a workout montage set to Led Zeppelin. Hemsworth should probably create one, just for fun, but in terms of Thor's character and the journey he was on, it wasn't necessary.\n\nSome characters got great endings while others did not get the justice they deserved.

They even do a great job of showing how the survivors have changed over the last five years. The first hour of the movie has extremely slow pacing and isn't something worth rewatching. The second act is also fairly slow, but starts getting a good amount of progress. I can't stress enough how epic the third act was, it brings you on an emotional roller coaster that will make you view everything else as inferior once you finish it. Its low points were still high and its high points were the highest you can get. 9/10, with what they were given, this is probably the best the Russo brothers could've ever done with this.

The film has a monumental task of trying to bring closure to so many characters and succeeds for the most part. I feel the time travel premise a little bit lazy which introduces multiple plot holes - but the geek inside me didn't care as I was captivated by what was on screen. Overall I think Infinity War is the better film, but this is a satisfying conclusion to this section of the MCU.",

The story arc of it's protagonists such as Captain America and Iron Man from their first solo films to Endgame is a work of ingenious planning and ultimately fulfilling. It's a bit embarrassing but this is only film to ever make me shout out with joy during a cinematic experience.

Not only that, Infinity War I think had a better final battle.  This final battle, while boasting the biggest ensemble of Marvel heroes we've ever seen on screen, is weirdly dark and muddied in CGI scenery compared to the battle at Wakanda from Infinity War.  Also I hate Professor Hulk, he's just not that fun.  Okay so those are my criticisms, what did I like about the movie?  I guess everything else?  The time travel plot let's us revisit and honor some old moments in Marvel with a new lens in sort of a Back to the Future Part 2 way that's a lot of fun, and it brings back some characters I didn't think we'd ever see again.  The movie has a big emotional core, and a climactic end that is godamn powerful.  This movie juggles a lot.  Seriously this is like watching someone juggle 10 flaming chainsaws, it's a godamn miracle it works at all.  That it works this well is even more of a miracle.

Even with a 3-hour runtime, the movie does not feel long. It is funny, epic, heart-warming, emotional, and inspiring. The cast and score were perfect, the visuals were stunning, and the story was everything I hoped for and more as it incorporated many elements from the MCU. 100/100.",

After twenty-one movies and ten long years, the world is finally saved and safe from its biggest threat. This movie was the perfect ending to this saga, yet strong enough to stand alone. Even though the movie is a three hour stretch, it's worth every bit of your time. I was on the edge of my seat and wouldn't even let myself take a bathroom break. I absolutely love how every one of the marvel characters we able to interact and meet each other. The way their storylines tied up was pleasing for me. I waited with anticipation for their paths to cross and once they did, I literally cheered. My favorite part of the movie was when the characters time traveled back to the original Avenger's Movie. It helped me remember some important points, and it was fun to see how much the characters have evolved since then. I feel that this movie had everything in it that I could have asked from the characters. Tony Stark was finally blessed with a child, and I got to see a more human side of him. Natasha Romanoff sacrificed her life to save the world and acquire the soul stone, therefore clearing the red in her ledger. No stone was left upturned in this movie, and every character received the noble ending that they truly deserved. Clint was reunited with his wife and two children. Thor has found a new home along the Guardians of the Galaxy, and Steve Rogers was reunited with the love of his life. Even though the movie meant a tragic end for Iron Man and The Black Widow, they went out as heroes. This movie was definitely one to remember, and worth the title of best movie ever.",

            "content": "In this movie, Thor is an obese, drunken, buffoon.  He is, not the god of thunder, but the god Falstaff whose antics, although funny, are full of sound & fury, signify nothing, and embarrassingly provoke a desire to shut him up rather than listen to him.  This movie is like that.  Although I respect what this crew has created over the last eleven years and appreciate the fun cinema they have produced, I stand with Mssrs. Scorcese & Coppola, this was quite a let down.  There were some good moments esp. from Robert Djr, Chris Evans, Scarlet J, & Mark Ruffalo.  Paul Rudd and Don Cheadle also gave fine performances for what they were worth. The cinematography was dazzling, colorful, and quite the carnival ride.  The CGI was very well done.  But they ruined the story - or rather, bungled it - and in bungling lost a great opportunity for real cinema.  \n\nFirst, It seemed as though they were unclear about what tone they wanted to strike.  Had they chosen a somber story about loss, sorrow, and recovery - that would have been great.  Had they chosen a story about bouncing back with humor and silliness that would have been acceptable.  Heck, even a story about getting the bad guy and kicking purple heinie would have been something.  Instead, they chose all three resulting in a lack of focus as to whether laughter, sorrow, pathos, or anger was the appropriate response.  \n\nFurthermore, instead of focusing on the story of one character they tried to tell the story of every character in the universe - and so failed.  First we were sympathizing with Hawkeye (portrayed brilliantly by Jeremy Renner who seems like he needs his own badass movie), then we sympathize with Iron Man (whose loss is visually apparent in his horribly emaciated frame and manic frustration), then we sympathize with Black Widow, then Thor, then Hulk, then... and so on.  There is never a moment where we can say \"Ah, this is the protagonist\" b/c there is no first sufferer.  Even in \"Civil War\" the protagonist was the Avengers itself fighting internally.  Here the focus was so screwy it was as though the director had a handheld camera and was moving frantically from character not sure whom to focus on.  \n\nThird, they betrayed the sacrifice made in the prior film with a cheap Deus Ex Machina.  At the end of \"Infinity War\" the MCU had the potential for an epic of real loss and human emotion.  But at the end of this movie not only does the cavalry/god appear to save the world from being overrun by CGI monstrosities, but those same monstrosities are done away with by the snap of a glaved finger.  Even though the finger is attached to the arm of Tony Stark who dies b/c of it (sorry, spoiler!), his loss doesn't have impact due to the gigantic nature of the CGI battle that has just ensued.  (Whenever HOLLYWIERD tries to solve its movie problem with a CGI battle we are due for epic failure; Wonder Woman, BvS, Justice League, Far from Home).  Moreover, bringing back all these glistening characters in the nick of time - untraumatized and revving for battle - simply seems cheap and lazy; almost comic.  How for instance did one of the billions of other organics snuffed out by Thanos NOT get caught up in that group of heroes when Dr. Strange rallied them for their Gandalf & Rohan Rider Return?  (Imagine being that shlub; alongside SpiderMan, Hulk, Thor, and Captain Marvel comes Larry Putz!  \"What the blitzen?  I'm supposed to be in Jersey!\"  and wouldn't there also be dogs and cats and birds and bugs and stuff?  Wasn't it one half of ALL living creatures?  parameciums and bacteria?)  Further what they represented, namely the men and women on this earth who have died trying to keep others safe, cannot come back again.  Ever.  \n\nAnd perhaps there in lies my greatest dissatisfaction with this movie.  It didn't really think through what it was saying about human life.  The crew, pandering to the drooling fanbase, seemed to be  going for glitz, noise, eye-popping spectacle and the chance to ogle each and every character in slow motion or sinuous lingering strolls with the camera as they stand in little groups of black, mourning their fallen comrade.  This mania to show every single character in the universe had the predictable effect of lessening the efforts of some of the greater actors (Cumberbatch, Boseman, and Holland were wasted on this movie) and magnifying even more how some of the actors/characters should never even have been introduced; even the little bits Brie Larsen had in this film were nauseatingly excessive, whilst Saldana, Gillan, and Olsen were hardly seen at all, and not to effect.  Though I admit it was good to see Tilda Swinton revising her role as the Ancient One, there was only the slightest nod to Bautista's great character, Drax, and what the heck happened to Loki?  The point being that in order to sell more action figures at Target the studio chose to bring in every character and make them super.  But when everyone is super... nobody is.  The studio gave thought only to selling product and not nearly enough thought on how to conclude the problem they had set up for the last eleven years. \n \nHad they really given thought to what the story was saying (in almost every movie up to this point) they would have heeded Thanos (played by Josh Brolin whose efforts were a highlight of this otherwise solely commercial enterprise) who delivers one of the better lines in the movie saying, \"You couldn't live with your own failure. Where did that bring you? Back to me.\"  Thanos is a brick wall.  He represents the one inevitable impediment that no one, no matter how powerful, can ever overcome.  His very name, Thanos, represents this - he is death, and the problem set up in this series of entertaining movies was whether having super powers could allow you to avoid death.  It cannot.  But accepting that, or dealing with that, constitutes the quintessential human problem.  No one here gets out alive.  Had the movie focused on the various responses to life's inevitable failure, had they set up a dilemma for Tony Stark between two major responses to death, that would have approached real epic status.  I can envision Tony having to choose between Cap's keep on trying to win with power and optimism attitude (\"I can do this all day\") vs. an angry, seething, violent Thor (rather than a fat, pussy, videogame drunkard Thor) hell bent on revenge but no Thanos against whom to revenge (the line \"you took everything from me\" given to him and not Scarlet Witch); trying to outthink the problem and realizing (coached by the astral bodied Dr. Strange) that the only way out was self-sacrifice - that would have been intense.\n\nInstead the studio chose cheap product and big profits over real story telling; loud cheering for the polythene heroes over deep introspection and mourning for the real human loss; glossy popcorn entertainment over actual artwork.  They created a legacy over eleven years that verged upon the epic but, having created it, failed to follow through and end it at the last.  Like Thor, they flashed in the pan, made some noise, and ended limpingly, overswollen, drunk, and futilely fizzling.  But, then again, they achieved a 97% at Tomatoes and raked in a ton of cash so... win, right?",

            "content": "This is my 100th post since I started this website, and that is ironic because I will be reviewing one of the most important movies of my lifetime with it. What is there to say though? After 22 movies, 11 years, and billions of dollars later, Marvel ended this saga with as good a movie as you can possibly ask for.  Every fan out there has invested so much time, money, and heart into these characters and the Russo Brothers, Kevin Feige, and the rest of the Marvel Machine delivered in a big way. The scale of this movie will never be matched and it only could have truly been felt if you have been there since the beginning.\n\nThese movies have meant so much to me since they started in 2008. I was a sophomore in high school when Iron Man came out and now I am out of college for 4 years and engaged. I grew up with these movies and it was so incredibly satisfying to sit in the theater, tears streaming down my face watching everything come together.\n\nMarvel changed movie making and the way we look at movies as a whole. I am just flabbergasted by the fact that they pulled this off. So here we go I am diving deep into Endgame here, so again be aware of spoilers!!\n\nThis movie was basically divided into three parts, oh and conveniently it is 3 hours so each part takes about an hour. The first hour is dealing with fallout from Infinity War, and building the team and plan to undo it. The second hour is the Avengers in teams of two time traveling through the history of the MCU to find the infinity stones, and the third hour is bringing everyone back and finishing Thanos once and for all. Each hour is incredible and brings different emotions to the table, there is legitimately a moment to laugh and cry about every ten minutes throughout each section of this movie. I will say though the second hour overall is some of the best work in Marvel history.\n\nThe reward for all Marvel fans is in those scenes when they travel back through the MCU and add to each and every character that they already built on. We get moments with Tony and his dad, Cap and Peggy Carter, Thor and his mom, and numerous more situations that make you feel nostalgia and excitement all at the same time (MORE STAN LEE!). Every scene has a new surprise that again will make you laugh, cry, cheer and every other emotion you can possibly have.\n\nI want to try and do something different here because Stock Watch does not really work with this, so I will just run through the characters and talk about what they mean to me and to the movie.\n\nTony Stark/Iron Man – The Heart and Soul of the series which will truly miss him now that he is (spoiler alert) dead! Iron Man 1 started the entire Universe and if it were not for the tone Robert Downey Jr. set and commitment he had to the movies, they would not be here today. His relationship with every single character was important and meaningful and he will be truly missed. Watching him snap his fingers to I AM IRON MAN was about as emotional as it gets.\n\nSteve Rogers/Captain America – The Leader of the Avengers and the man delivering the positive messages throughout the series. Chris Evans has been fantastic throughout the saga, but he was particularly good in this. He really got to show a range of acting skills and had the two best moments of this movie. When he got to hold Thor's Hammer my crowd went Bananas, and when every hero emerges and he finally gets to say AVENGERS ASSEMBLE, the tears were streaming down my face and it might have been my favorite moment in cinematic history. His send off was perfect and passing the torch to Sam felt right.\n\nTHOR! – Thor started out in the MCU as more of a Shakespearean figure but has turned into easily the funniest main character in the Universe. His entrance to Wakanda was ICONIC, but his treatment in this movie was so unexpected and perfect that I will remember it forever. They make him a fat Fortnite playing slob that has forgotten what it means to be The God of Thunder. His road back and redemption is great and basically every word Chris Hemsworth says throughout the movie is hysterical.\n\nBruce Banner/Hulk – This character actually started out with Edward Norton playing Bruce in The Incredible Hulk, but they cast Mark Ruffalo for the Avengers and have not looked back. He has done a great job balancing the Bruce Banner role with the craziness of the Hulk, however in this he gets to do something totally different. He has become Professor Hulk which is the Hulk with Bruce's Brain. This is one of the best Marvel gags ever and gives Ruffalo a chance to shine. He was hilarious and gave us a completely unique look at the character which is not easy to do 22 movies in.\n\nClint Barton/Hawkeye/Ronin and Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow – These two have been linked together really since the original Avengers. They are the only heroes without \"powers\" and they always had an unspoken sexual tension between them on some level. They both had very emotional arcs culminating on Vormir where in order to get the Soul stone one of them needed to sacrifice themselves. They have an epic fight where both are trying to kill themselves, ultimately finishing with Black Widow dying for good. This was one of the best scenes in the movie and puts a stamp on one of the ancillary relationships in the Avengers.\n\nScott Lang/Ant Man – At the end of Ant Man and the Wasp, Ant Man was trapped in the Quantum Realm, meaning he missed all the events of Infinity War. So, the beginning of Endgame has him figuring out what happened and then finding the Avengers to try and figure out how to make a \"time machine.\" He has so many funny moments playing the audience avatar of sorts and really has been an awesome addition to the MCU.\n\nNebula – Nebula was a character introduced in Guardians of the Galaxy as a daughter of Thanos. She did not have much personality and was honestly built to be a killer. Over time she has blossomed, but never really was given a chance to shine. Here in Endgame she becomes sort of the key to the whole story, which just shows the power of the Marvel brand and these characters. Karen Gillan did a great job and I really enjoyed all of my time with her.\n\nWar Machine/Rocket Raccoon – Not much to say about these two, they had a few hysterical lines and heartfelt moments but did not add too much to the overall story. I do enjoy their presences in the MCU though.\n\nAll of the other \"snapped\" Characters (Black Panther, Spidey, Scarlet Witch, the rest of the Guardians and the numerous others) are in the movie later on and do not play a huge role in the story. Same with Captain Marvel, she is there only when they need her and then she flies away. These will all be the stars of the franchise moving forward though. So we will be seeing plenty more of them.\n\nWhat else can you say about this movie honestly? The Russo Brothers have done an unbelievable job with the 4 movies they did and accomplished everything a comic book fan can dream of. Kevin Feige had incredible vision and foresight that led to, in my opinion, the greatest cinematic achievement of all time.\n\n*A couple other tidbits\n\n- I loved how we hear Sam in Cap's ear to signal everyone coming back, it is a chills inducing moment that only Marvel can produce.\n\n- KORRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG (if you know, you know)\n\n- The scene where all the women in the Universe get together is pointed, but very awesome.\n\nJuice Rating: \n96/100",

But I am up to the challenge, and though I would love nothing more than to talk all day about this film in depth and in great detail, I will keep this review as general as possible. As they say, all good things must come to an end, and so it is with the Avengers saga… and what an ending it is. I loved it, and if you are fan, I am 100% sure you will love it, too. Talk about sticking the landing! From the somber beginning to the exciting middle to the epic climax, this is a fully fleshed out movie that stands on its own… and I'm so glad they didn't sell out to the Part 1/Part 2 cash-grabbing bullshit and just let it be what it is. Yes, it's long, but it needed to be (and it sure doesn't feel long, I could have stood for more!). The sheer magnitude of the challenge of merging the storylines from 21 movies into a single film that brings the arcs and stories of about a zillion different characters to a fully satisfying conclusion just boggles the mind. But somehow, the brothers Russo have pulled it off, and in glorious fashion. Though it's certainly a spectacle, there is so much more to it than that; it's the character-focused moments that make it great, and there are many. You will run the gamut of emotions watching this film - there are moments that make you laugh, gasp, cry, and cheer. Each of the three acts has its own distinctive tone that seamlessly blends with the next, culminating in a battle scene that is the very definition of climactic. It's A LOT… maybe even too much. But do I care? No. Because god damn, it is F**KING EPIC, and everything a fan would ever want to it to be. The story has more than its fair share of holes, but with so many characters and storylines to deal with, it's an easy flaw to forgive. The sheer number of characters that make an appearance in this movie is jaw-dropping. It's a lot of ends to tie up, but the film does so with efficiency and a sensitivity I did not expect (though I should have). What has made this franchise so successful isn't the action or even the stories; it's the depth and relateability of its characters, and in this last chapter, it does not stray from that ideal. For us long-term fans, these characters have grown into real people that we truly care about, and the film delivers on giving us satisfying and emotional payoffs for almost each character (and throws in a bunch of clever callbacks to previous films for good measure). I do think the denouement went on a little too long (it got a little Lord-of-the-Rings-y there), but the final scene is just perfect, and not at all the note on which you would expect a 22-movie superhero saga to end. I really couldn't ask for a better finale to such a magnificent collection of films. Thank you, MCU. And thank you, Jon Favreau – if it wasn't for him and his original Iron Man film, we wouldn't have any of this.",

In my book, leading into Avengers:Endgame Joe & Anthony Russo are 3/3 in the MCU; and they continue their perfect streak- giving us a well-crafted film to cap off the Infinity Saga. The Russos always find the perfect balance of humor; but also the feeling of real threat. They seem to effortlessly juggle the challenges of a massive star cast. Finding the right words when making this review is impossible.I can't accurately capture how well they've done this film but the phrase \"Wrapped up perfect with a bow on it\" comes to mind. They've pulled off something I thought was impossible. Over the last 11 years, I have watched every single MCU film & every foundation film and they are all honored in so many ways. Looking back will make you laugh, cry & just sit back in awe that you've been apart of this journey; through this incredible cinematic world. \nMy standouts of the film are the original 6- Ironman, Captain America, Thor, Black-Widow, Hawkeye, & The Hulk. They are all legends of this universe & we are reminded of why we love them all, like family, every second of the film. Now at this point of the review we're going enter major SPOILERS!! The many magical moments in this film are unlimited; and yes, I said magical because, that's just purely what they are. First off, going back to the Russos paying homage to all the films- these moments are blended perfectly into the film. During the time heist, we go back to the Battle of New York, Asgard, Vormir, Morag, Sanctum Sanctorum under the ancient ones guard etc. I could not believe how incredibly they structured this time jump through MCU history into the film and have it all fit without feeling overloaded. Next, killing Thanos in the opening minutes of the film was genius. I totally didnt see that coming. Every audience I sat with, the 3 times I've gone to see it, had their jaws on the ground. Moving onto Fat Thor ! It was very controversial and not everyone liked it - myself included, at first. But in the third act, when the lightning forms around Thor, and he weilds Mjolnir & Stormbreaker and his hair in in braids- I was all in. He looked like a badass Viking 🤘🤘🤘 Then it led to the Trinity Vs. A fully Battle Armored Thanos - the showdown I craved most. Leading to the Nerdgasm moment of Cap finally wielding Mjolnir ! 😱😱This was totally unexpected but man when it happened everyone went nuts and my heart was pounding out of my chest !! Then, watching Cap battle Thanos wielding both the shield and hammer was incredible !! How he utilized both the hammer & shield together in battle was absolutely stunning. NOW !!! THE PORTALS SCENE !! This will go down not only as iconic in comic book movies but also as one of the most Iconic moments in Cinematic History. The culmination of 10 years of the Marvel Cinematic Universe on full display!! Every beloved character together, as one, facing down Thanos' army; ready to Avenge the World \n; with,Alan Silvestri's score blaring in the background. We witness Captain America for the first time finally say.....AVENGERS ASSEMBLE !! 😱😱😱🤘🤘🤘😲😲😲😍😍😍🤯🤯🤯The goosebumps were so bad my skin hurt !! I could not believe what I was seeing in front of me, it was literally something out of dream. Absolutely legendary ! Now to the end, wielding the Nano Gauntlet bracing before the fatal snap we hear Tony Stark's last words \"And I......am Iron-Man.\" \"Heartbreaking\" is not a strong enough word to explain the impact of the scene that follows. Watching Tony's loved ones watch him fade into peace. We say goodbye to the Legend of the MCU Robert Downey Jr. (As Tony Stark/Iron-Man). But it wasn't over just yet, another arc comes to a close, and that is Chris Evans (as Steve Rogers). Like I said before the Russos nail it. Cap going back in time to be with Peggy was a perfect ending to the Steve Rogers character, it wrapped poetically beautiful. \nFlaws of the film- dont get me wrong there are many plot holes but I wouldn't fix them because that takes away the incredible scenes we were given instead. \nOverall, I know I'm missing so much stuff I want to spill out about this film but to sum up this review (if thats possible to do) this may in fact be the best comic book movie of All-Time !! So many elements back this statement up, not just from MCU fans but comic fans as well. It is wrapped up in one Epic, Amazing, Incredible Conclusion to the Infinity Saga !! I am proud to be a Nerd & to Disney, The Godfather Kevin Feige, & Stan Lee you have forever changed the cinematic universe. I am honored to be apart of this Incredible journey that started in 2008 to.........THE ENDGAME !!!!\n",

YES THEY DID!!! For me I like Endgame more than Infinity War, so this makes it my favourite MCU movie to date. The way that they delivered on everything is just spectacular to see on the screen. The 3hr runtime doesn't feel like it's dragging on at times which was important for the storytelling, and yes this one is more focus on the story than the action it self... but that 3rd act is the best 3rd act in a superhero movie ever. The fan service that the Russos placed in that 3rd along at times with the piece of music \"Portals\" will always give me goosebumps every time. \"Portals\" is one of the best pieces of music ever in a film. Hands down! Although this is a slow built up film. Everything that the MCU had placed beforehand, Endgame made sure to tie up all the loose ends and to tie up the all the stories involving the main set of characters. This is also very emotional film, as 3 of the main characters get the best send off that we could have wished for.... the most emotional one was (SPOILER) Tony's Death and the funeral that took place straight after the final battle when its quiet and have all the people that has been part of Tony's life in one way or another is just fantastic to see, and it did bring a few tears to my eyes.... steve's send off is another great moment as he has (SPOILER) gone back in time to spend his life with Peggy and when he came back to the present as a old man, giving his Shield to Sam. People biggest complain with Endgame is the whole Thor storyline, but in fact, I don't really have any problems with it what so ever. ",

Thank you ever so much for utterly ruining my viewing experience with the sounds of your children's tears.\nI really can't be bothered to write much about this as it marks the end of my investment with mArVeL pHiLmS!!!!, which is a position I'm very pleased to be in (I know, good for you and your superior tastes Benjamin). I'll just sum it up quickly.\nThe film delivers an ending to the Infinity Saga that is satisfying in pretty much every way for a longtime MCU fan, however that only begins around about two hours in. The first hour proves that characters that spend most of their free time galavanting around in spandex and punching things do not do melodrama well, at all. The time travel stuff is just stupid and literally wastes half an hour of your time before the film acknowledges its own gaping plot hole and gets to what anyone else would've done in the Avengers' situation. The final act of the film is pretty spectacular and the ending is great. So if you like mArVeL pHiLmS!!!!, go watch it, you'll love it.\n\nI do want to add something however; the thing is about mArVeL pHiLmS!!!! is that they're all fundamentally pretty stupid, so when they try to get deep, especially with that constant vein of humour running through the writing, I just don't care about it at all. I know that all you want to do is show me the big fight scene, so just do that instead of meandering about pretending you're depressed whilst still cracking a joke about Captain Marvel's new haircut before you get there. mArVeL pHiLmS!!!! really have managed an incredible feat of being so deeply unsure of what tone they want to go for that it somehow works in their favour that they do everything at once.

Because, sure enough, two minutes later there came the words \"time travel\". Ok, so this whole mess is gonna be fixed up by using the oldest artifice in the book; go back in time and stop the whole thing from happening. They may as well have painted the screen with the fatal words \"But they woke up and realized it was all just a dream\". Seriously, I thought The Avengers were a little more sophisticated than that. Never mind that we hear over & over again from Tony Stark that time travel is impossible, as indeed it is, for travelling back in time breaks the Law of Causality and unless you are either Albert Einstein II or a truly genius screenwriter (think \"Primer\"), you just don't; notwithstanding Stark miraculously finds a way, and he's such a genius that he does it while he's playing around with his daughter no less! Between then and the end just about every syrupy, sorry tired cinematic trope and cliche you can imagine is invoked: a beloved female character is sacrificed, broken America gets it together and saves the world; at the very last minute, just when everything is doomed, a miraculous but totally irrational inexplicable intervention saves the day. Yawn. Sorry Avengers, your time is up. I guess Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans agree. ",

It has raised the bar so high that I don't know how many any super hero movie is going to be able to top this one. I just hope future super hero movies don't try to make it this epic without the great quality done in this film because it will water down the super hero genre, if it isn't already. The movie is 3 hours long but you don't feel the length of the movie at all, it feels a lot shorter, the pacing is excellent. They dive into the characters issues much more than I expected, by showing how much everyone has suffered from the time of Infinity War. Its a must watch for any super hero fan. It is the highest grossing film ever, and is probably the pinnacle of all super hero movies.",

            "content": "When I say that Avengers Engame is the most overrated movie of 2019, I mean that people and critics praised it more, the movie, yes, you could say that it is \"good\", but not so much for everyone to go crazy and say that it is the best superhero movie, a great example of how overrated it would be like, this movie was recently titled as the highest grossing movie in the history of cinema in general.\nYes, if the film is very striking with its colors and all those characters, but simply what in Avengers Infinity War \"struggled\" to maintain the quality of the plot, here it simply does not matter, I just say that Captain Marvel suddenly find Tony and the other lady, they do not explain at any time how he did to find them, yes, if I know that the marvel lovers have already drawn their theories on that, to cover up the lazy mistakes of the writers. In Infinity War we saw the Thor plus Thor of the Thores, but now he is an obese alcoholic, the movie is not taken seriously sometimes, and that is a great example, or that Tony gets angry at first with Captain America because he does not It was there, blah, blah, blah, but if we use our brains, you will remember that in Infinity War he had the opportunity to call him and he did not, so I'm sorry Iron man lovers, but Tony had no right to get angry, and if we analyzed him well really Captain Marvel was a filler character, we all believed that this character would have great weight for the story but no, I thought that they did not try hard in their movie because they were going to want all this, but no, you can feel that the writers they didn't know what to do with it, and something they did go over with was the rat that accidentally released Ant-man, I'm just saying that you are more likely to see a cow flying outside your house to have that happen, which I leave wondering if the truck was closed, then how the fuck did that rat could get in?\nThe time travel is very badly done, quantum physics clearly says that two equal objects cannot be together at the same time in the same place, so that fight of the American captains is impossible, and the rest is not even said , for example, Captain America in the end stays in the past meaning that The Avengers never had Captain America, which means that everything he did never happens, which leaves me wondering. Why did nothing change? Why is there no temporary paradox or any consequence for your decision? It's simple, the movie is so shameless in the sense that it doesn't care about those rules and does what it gives the gift wins. After that for no reason, Steve gives his position to Falcon because ............. in order to make a reference to the comics, he prefers to give his position to an African-American who he met recently Than your lifelong friend.\nSomething that I honestly didn't understand, was how the gauntlet works, are you supposed to think about what you want and what happens? I don't know, I think, because Hulk throne his fingers and half of the universe that had disappeared comes back, but here goes the problem, if you think about it that is the worst thing he had to do, Thanos technically had already saved the universe by reducing the population , and that was something that the Avengers failed to understand, but that is the least, the problem is that being logical, of that half world literally literally, I wonder where the hell are all these people going to live? 5 years have passed and obviously their houses must already be inhabited by someone else, or their jobs, and logically they should have had an economic imbalance, but hey, the Avengers don't care about that and they are happy because they saved their friends, just I say his plan was very selfish.\nIf you think about it really, the one who lost the most was Thanos, his goal was really not bad, that for starters, even in a part of the movie Steve tells Natasha something that the planet is less polluted Thanos was looking for his stones for a long time time and when he found the last one to get it he had to sacrifice his daughter, he also lost his friends, henchmen or not dry were, then after saving the universe, he just wanted to live in peace and eat his broth, but the Avengers do not arrive and they kill him, then they make a plan for all their sacrifices to go to waste, poor Thanos.\nTo tell the truth that Hulk is now Hulk-Banner does not really bother me, what I would have liked is that they would have spent time on that, for example a movie of that would not be bad.\nBut well now talk about how good this movie has, and I'd like to start with those little big details, which would be like Hulk uses a pencil to press the keys because his fingers are too big, or that Iron Man gives the hug to that Spiderman did not want to give him at Homecomeming, also that Bucky tells Steve that he is going to miss him although he is supposed to only leave for a few seconds, but it is because he knows him enough to know that Steve is going to live his life, and that that would be the last time he sees him young and for me that he is the best he would be being that in the final battle with Thanos, Thor every blow he hits is directed at Thanos's head.\nAnd as brave as it has been to kill Ironman, it was really a bit forced, although the only thing I managed to sacrifice was to avoid the salvation of the universe. I will analyze the advantage and cons.\nPros:\n-Give more years of life to humanity before it destroys itself.\n-They managed to complete their goal.\nCons:\n-To condemn humanity.\n-Leave his wife a widow.\n-Let your daughter an orphan.\n- Wreck the work of a visionary.\n-Kill oneself.\nBut the point is that the greatest hero of Marvel was sacrificed, the man who created Ultron, the man who caused the civil war between his companions and then locked them in, the man who created all those marvel villains like the Vulture , Mystery, Mandarin, etc. But hey, goodbye Ironman.\nSo and I have two questions for marvel lovers. How is it possible for a human being to create a gauntlet that supports the gems of infinity, when Infinity War told us that only a certain metal made by certain dwarves can do it? The only conclusion I reach is that Tony is a god or a celestial being. I also understand that if he is a god, he would be Ojo de Alcon, since he is in a moment of the movie he grabs a gem of the infinite with his hand and in guardians of the galaxy I learned that only a celestial or a god can grab the gems without dying, and in this movie, Ojo de alcon grabs it and nothing happens, so I understand that this man is a god or a celestial. Do not?\n Something that I admire about this movie is that it is very good lying, to this I mean that it is so good lying that it made half the world believe that it is the best film not only of the year, not only of the genre of Super-heroes, but of the best movies in history, they are good lying that with the jokes, the characters, the fights and all those colors of this movie, it covers all those plot holes and makes people believe that it is an almost perfect movie, so it is of Men recognize that this movie cheated the world and almost fooled me.\nIn conclusion Avengers Endgame is a very good movie lying, with a great final battle, and with many plot holes, I just want to say that I found it very difficult to put the rating on this movie, it was between 4 to 6, but then I decided that This is only a 6/10, even though deep down in my heart I know it deserves less.",

I wouldn't even try doing a review with spoilers til this movie hits blu-ray.\n\nSo.... it's pretty goddamned hard to talk about this movie!\n\nSo yeah if you don't want ANY spoilers, stop reading and see the movie, but I won't be giving away the gold here, I'm not an asshole.... unlike the commenters on EVERY single Youtube video, so don't watch Youtube til you see the movie either!\n\nAnyway...\n\nThis was a pretty great comic book movie. Just when I thought Infinity War set a new bar for what's possible for visual effects and epic storytelling in comic book movies..... Endgame manages to take it to another level..... and I really mean that.\n\nI'd say probably the best thing about this movie is aside from maybe 2 or 3 out of a hundred moments in this movie..... I could not believe how surprising the story of this movie was. About 10 minutes in they do like 3 things that completely changed how I thought this movie was going to play out.\n\nAnd over the course of this 3 hour movie they followed every surprising turn with another. You normally find that level of surprise in truly original films, random example I had no clue where Whiplash was going. But I've never been so unable to predict the plot of a comic book movie before. It's nothing but left turns when normally a Marvel movie goes in a straight line.\n\nThere's elements of time travel in this movie and what better way to add unpredictability to what is now the 22nd film in a series? I can almost see the writers going \"We're probably going to have to work in time travel to come up with more ideas.\"\n\nThe 2nd act of the movie... or 3rd act... kind of a 4 act movie.... but anyway the middle chunk of this movie is where the time travel materiel occurs and I was stunned at how much fun AND emotion they managed to get out of something that might sound like a cheat way to resolve the superbly dark ending of Infinity War. There's practically an entire film here just dealing with the time travel elements. You could almost make it the Thanos trilogy if you REALLY wanted.\n\nBut they make it all work inside one film. 3 hours long and it feels like it, but not in a bad way. Nothing feels stretched out, 3 hours really is how long this movie NEEDS to tell this story. Matter of fact there's a shocking number of things that were NOT resolved that made me wish this movie was another half hour LONGER which I can't believe.\n\nThe Russo brothers directing and Christopher Markus and Stephen McFreely writing.... this current era of the MCU might be over but I REALLY hope these 4 guys keep making Marvel movies because at this point I think they're the best at it. The fact that they were able to squeeze so much into these 2 Thanos movies without dropping the ball at any point is unreal. Joss Whedon couldn't even equal his own work when he did a second Avengers movie.\n\nThe actors in this movie are all first-rate as per usual.\n\nRobert Downey Jr. continues his insane streak of performances since 2008 with Iron Man and continues to make Tony Stark one of the greatest comic to movie translations to date.\n\nChris Evans, I thought Cap was shockingly absent from Infinity War, he had like 4 lines it felt like. Well now that Spidey, Doctor Strange and the Guardians of the Galaxy are all dead...... Cap gets some more screen time. And boy do they give Cap some standout moments, both action wise and dramatically. There's one action moment Cap gets that made my theater's audience lose their minds, it was the only moment like that in the movie. They laughed at all the jokes and so forth, the odd gasp here and there. But this one moment I'm talking about produced the loudest gasp I've ever heard watching movies my whole life. Captain America and Chris Evans knock it out of the park in Endgame.\n\nChris Hemsworth, well.... I don't know what you THOUGHT they were gonna do with Thor in this movie now that he's back to being the all-powerful hammer-wielding God of Thunder..... but I sure as hell didn't expect what his role ended up being. Hemsworth is fantastic in the movie, keeping up his recent work evolving Thor into one of the more interesting Avengers. I will say.... I was genuinely weirded out by Thor in this movie.\n\nCap, Iron Man and Thor have one fight scene together that really made me smile. I'm surprised it took so long to get that kind of fight scene from them.\n\nJosh Brolin, I won't give away Thanos' part to play in Endgame. But I will say it was possibly the most surprising thing in the movie for me. Like so surprising I almost stepped out of the movie for a moment because all I could think of was \"Jeez, that's smart..... dammit, I never would have thought of that!\" But suffice to say Thanos remains the best villain in the MCU.\n\nI'd be here all day listing every Avenger and their actor. I'll go quick here and say what you need to know about other actors in the cast. Jeremy Renner is great as Hawkeye. Mark Ruffalo is great as Hulk.... his part in the movie was spoiled by imagery I saw in line for POPCORN but that's another matter. Scarlett Johansson's great as Black Widow. Brie Larson is..... OK let me break off for a sec here.\n\nBoy did they waste a lot of time building up Captain Marvel lemme just say that. Because if you thought Captain Marvel was going to step in and save the day... like I was.... you're mistaken. All that build up for Captain Marvel and ESPECIALLY her role in this movie and I was stunned at how little screen time Brie Larson has. I figured this was gonna be her movie and... yeah it's really not. But Brie Larson's good in the movie with probably about 6 lines of dialog.\n\nAnd maybe not all that surprisingly Paul Rudd and Ant-Man steal a lot of the show in Endgame. I can't believe the amount of juice they managed to squeeze out of a character whose whole thing is shrinking and growing.\n\nThere's.......... so much more to say...... like so..... so.... SO much more..... but you gotta see the movie before I could feel right getting into it. But it all has to do with that feeling of surprise I felt throughout the movie.\n\nSo many times in this movie I thought \"Perfect.... that was perfect.\" That's the bottom line with Avengers: Endgame.\n\nNot the end of the MCU of course.... how they can possibly... logistically top this movie I'm almost afraid to think about because.... I don't see it, frankly. If I owned Marvel I'd say, hit the ol' reboot button, recast, work in the X-Men and the Fantastic Four and let's start MCU 2. But.... I mean who am I kidding, they know what they're doing, obviously.\n\nI WISH TO HELL I could say I liked Endgame more than Infinity War... but I can't. Infinity War's the better movie, better story, I would say better action, better pacing, better ending.... that's the whole thing here, Infinity War was Empire Strikes Back and Endgame is Return of the Jedi. I love Jedi but.... it's no Empire now is it.\n\nAlso one thing I loved about Infinity War was how big a role the Guardians of the Galaxy had, it was half their movie.  And of course they're not in this movie besides Rocket and that's a little disappointing as a fan. \n\nBut that doesn't take anything away from how ridiculously entertaining Endgame is. I have no doubt when we hit February 2020 and I'm going over what the best movies, scenes and performances of of 2019 were.... I'm going to be thinking of Avengers: Endgame an awful lot.\n\nThe year is still young but I mean..... yeah.... Avengers: Endgame is my favorite movie of 2019 so far.",

The first and second act might lack some action sequences because it focuses more on their 'time-heist' plan, but the THIRD ACT would really give the fans what they want and you would find yourself screaming and crying! The second act might have fewer action choreographies but it would give you the nostalgia and appreciation of the whole MCU, and how Kevin Feige stitched every movie flawlessly.

            "content": "Avengers: Endgame was a disappointment for me. I don't even know where to start. The movie's pacing was horrible. It took forever for the plot to kick in. The Russo brothers completely butchered Hulk and Thor, especially the Hulk.\nI know they wanted to infuse Bruce Banner's intelligent mind in the Hulk's body for him to become Professor Hulk (like from the comics), but it was done SO HORRIBLY. The Hulk didn't even kill any enemy in the movie and barely fought. Hulk looked like Shrek in this movie. Hulk was SO CRINGE in this film. The worst depiction of the Hulk EVER!\nHe looked so stupid and ugly. He was literally only there for helping with the time travel stuff and for comic relief. He didn't beat up nor kill any enemy nor yelled and smashed anything. He didn't even have his Hulk anger nor voice, he had Bruce's voice when he was the Hulk and seeing him wear glasses, talking with Banner's voice. I felt like we were robbed of a Hulk vs. Thanos rematch.\nThe Russo brothers turned Thor into a stupid, comedic, fat drunk with an ugly beard. In one scene, Thor is a fat, lazy, immature alcoholic sitting down drinking lots of beer and playing Fortnite with Korg (who is atrociously voiced and portrayed by the overrated, severely miscast Taika Waititi) and some weird, little creature. Hulk tried to talk Thor into coming with him back to the Avengers and help them. Hulk soon convinces Thor by offering him loads of bottles of beer on the way to the Avengers facility. Thor looks kind of like an ugly hobo when he is fat and big-bearded.\nHulk and Thor were forever ruined. They were depicted so atrociously that it wasn't even funny. That alone was enough for me to hate this film. Hulk and Thor are just jokes now. I will never forgive Disney, Kevin Feige, and the Russo brothers for completely butchering those two beloved characters.\nThe time travel plot of the movie was so complicated, confusing, and made no sense. All of that time travel nonsense created so many countless, gigantic plot holes. The time travel was so senseless and illogical that it gave me a headache. The time travel scenes were extremely boring.\nThen when it finally came to the final battle in the third act, the part that took so long to finally happen, I was annoyed by that stupid, pointless WOKE scene where all the female characters (Iron Maiden, Wasp, Captain Marvel, Scarlet Witch, Shuri, Okoye, Nebula, Gamora, Mantis, and Valkyrie) randomly assemble together by themselves away from all the male characters. The one thing that really pissed me off about the third act was that Iron Man was killed off at the end! How could those idiot script writers kill him off?! Iron Man never got to confront and face his arch enemy, the Mandarin! That means no Iron Man 4!\nOh and that ending with Steve Rogers time traveling back to the past to get rid of the Infinity Stones made no sense and left me feeling confused and scratching my head. So after he does that, he teleports back offscreen and Bucky and Sam see him sitting on a bench smiling as a wrinkly, gray-haired, senile 100-year-old man wearing a wedding ring. So when he went back in time to get rid of the Infinity Stones, did he get happily married and finally lose his virginity to Peggy (the woman of his dreams whom he fell in love with since World War II)? If so, won't that alter the future or something? Won't that mean he didn't get frozen and meet the Avengers and Sam Wilson? (I am deeply confused)\nOverall, Avengers: Endgame had a lot of good things going on in it, had great action scenes, and left quite an emotional impact, and was a somewhat epic swan song to the main Avengers franchise, but was ultimately confusing, horribly paced, poorly executed, inconsistent with its tone, filled with countless huge plot holes, had a bit too many jokes that derailed a lot of epic moments (what do you expect from a Disney Marvel movie?), disappointing, failed to deliver, failed to live up to expectations, and failed to live up to its huge hype. This movie could have been SO MUCH BETTER. I expected a lot better. There were still many missed opportunities and even unanswered questions.",

Such a Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Scharlet Johanson, Chris Hemswoth.\nI think that development of the movie is great because it develops in many planets in the universe and that give it a big reach. The story of the film is fantastic because it was planned 10 years ago with the premiere of iron man in 2008 and in 21 movies in the marvel cinematic universe.\nEach one of this 21 movies has relevance to the story with the culmination in Avengers Endgame; characters like iron man, hulk, captain america, thor, spider man awere building this great and fantastic universe.\nIn the film each superhero gets their moment to shine. The visual effects are amazing epecially in the final battle sequence, capturing the massive scope of the battle and the multiple fights going on between the characters.\nEndgame is one of the best movies in the history because it doesn´t have a happy end like in all the movies, however when you finish to watch you are really happy and satisfied with the resut because the cycle of many characters that appears 10 years ago is over and avengers endgame is just that is a new beginning for the new super heros in the marvel cinematic universe.\nThe movie recived praise for it´s incredible acting, music, direction, special effects and emotional weight; it beat the record at the box office colecting around 2,790 million dollars in the world making it in the most fundraising movie in the history.\nStill, there are some pacing issues and more than a few plot contrivances however Avenger Engame is a excelent movie and excelent conclution for this incredible saga.\n\n",

The Russo brothers are a couple of masters, everything is calculated and the way that they develop the story and the final battle it`s just incredible, I just cried in the cinema like a child, and the actors are just insane, the performance of Robert Downey Jr. it´s perfect the way that his history ends with the words \"I`m iron man\".  It ends like it starts. \nAnother thing that I really liked it´s the performance of Josh Brolin as Thanos, OMG, it´s just insane, he is in another league, he`s the best villain of all the MCU.\nIn my own opinion this movie deserves at least an Oscar, it could be for the performance of the actors, or the CGI, it´s sooooo good. \nIn conclusion the final battle always going to be in my heart, I just went bananas when the cap was in front of Thanos and his army, and suddenly falcon told him \" On your left\" and the portals just started to appear, it was the best moment of all the superheroes movies of all times.\nFrom my point of view everybody should watch it. It´s a master piece and also it`s the culmination of 11 years of movies, 22 movies end with this final chapter.\n",

The action, the dialogue and the pacing was so similar to what you'd see in a Avengers comicbook, this movie was without a doubt the perfection of what Marvel movies have wanted to become. Taking a comicbook page and transferring it over into a live action acting. For that reason I pretty much consider this as the best Marvel movie ever made.",

But what we're all here to see - the remaining Avengers plotting against Thanos and \"avenging\" his crimes against the universe, is captured rather well despite the outcome being somewhat predictable considering Marvel didn't do as good of a job hiding future movies from leaking to the public. Yes, despite that the events that occur still feel fresh and almost unpredictable and the movie really flares up as the 3 hour mark draws nearer, meaning don't bail if you're a little uninterested in the first hour because it gets really, really good. What's always been amazing is how well Marvel movies can use so many characters effectively with big backgrounds and big personalities but never feel like it's leaving anyone out. Give how many members there are of these Avengers that's a pretty incredible feat. I don't think I'd call Endgame a perfect conclusion to what we know of as the 3rd wave which started with Captain America Civil War (ends with Endgame) but it's pretty close. The movie did something that Star Wars 1-3 failed to do: deliver in the midst of great expectations and familiarity with where things are going and I love that. ",

This was supposed to be the biggest, most spectacular, most moving movie in the MCU, and I left the theater rather disappointed.\n\nWhere Infinity War was able to juggle their massive cast of characters with relative ease, Endgame haphazardly fumbles with nearly half as many characters over a longer slower movie. Several character arcs are cut short, perhaps to save room for additional sequels, while others are cut entirely. I thought the treatment of our beloved green giant was humorous at first, but when I realized that he was written out of the script entirely, I was livid. Thor's character arc was solid, but perhaps at the expense of his overarching character. Where it makes sense for the context of the Avengers movies, it is entirely baffling that so much of his character growth from his own movies was sacrificed. Character regression is fine, and actually commonplace, but when the resolution is unfulfilling, the entire duration of their screen time feels like a waste.\n\nOthers have noted that certain minority and female roles have been relegated to the back burners, but I feel the same could be said about most of the characters. After having seen Black Widow and Nebula's character arcs and Scarlet Witch's resolved story line from Infinity War, I could hardly see how we had seen the same movie, but characters like Captain Marvel, Shuri, and War Machine did seem to have minor roles, for what it is worth,",

There was enough here to enjoy (especially a certain weapon wielding moment of joy) but it felt more like a 'best of' compilation then a well-structured standalone outing. (SPOILERS FROM HERE....) The first act was gloriously good, the fallout from the previous film really hammered home and built on. Then the hulk was introduced... And my goodness I was dissappointed with bruce banner's character arc being ended OFF SCREEN. Him and Natalia had basically zero interaction, and he was used largely as a joke machine. Thor also (although hilarious) was almost completely comedic. He met his own dead mother and told jokes every single second he was with her... No raw tender moment there. Endgame felt much more of a popcorn turn-your-brain-off film than Infinity war (which wasn't exactly the imitation game either). It must have been tremendously hard balancing this film and the main retiring players (Cap, Iron Man) got their dues, black widow and hawkeye's mission for the soul stone just rehashed Gamora's death but with less impact which was a bit of a lame way to go about it, and the whole 2nd act was just referencing and replaying scenes from the previous marvel films with different outcomes. It felt like a youtube comments section or a 'How it should have ended' video had been inserted into an avengers film, which really felt unnecessary. (why did cap need to fight cap? Why does Bruce's professor hulk act so... Dumb?) A lot of these moments felt forced and unnecessary, with a levity that just didn't quite suit all the build up. All in all I came out of the theatre and said I thought the film was average... My girlfriend responded that I was mental and it was fantastic. It's the same response I see everywhere, and I am  happy so many enjoyed it, but sad that I cannot share the sentiment. It's just not as good as it promised to be. Infinity war for me will suffice as a brutal but glorious pinnacle of the marvel universe. ",

The problem is the Thanos we seen for most of this movie had very little knowledge of all the superheroes he was fighting. He obviously had no knowledge of what happened in Infinity Wars. So the fight scenes didn't have as much weight to them as they should have. This was the biggest problem I had with them using time travel. Also time travel has been done so many times it just felt cheap and lazy. I'm also not a fan of them making Thor fat and making Hulk more human like. They are trying to get rid of all the best male superheroes. They also killed off Iron Man. They are full on SJW's putting down male characters and trying to make the female ones look better. I can't stand this trend with Marvel. You also get a scene with all the women superheroes on screen at once. It's too in your face at this point for me. I like strong female leads like Wonder Woman if done right. But Marvel goes about it the wrong way. The ending had some cool action scenes with some cool CGI. But that doesn't make a movie good. It's something that can help compliment a movie if everything else is good. But this movie was terrible in my opinion.",

(Spoilers Ahead)\n\nFirst off, the argument between Black Widow and Hawkeye was a bit silly. Everyone was expecting Hawkeye to sacrifice himself and he was the most likely to do so. He hasn't done much in the MCU and Black Widow has a big fan following and many fans really care about her. Also, Black Widow would have an awesome film career vs making prequels about her and not having the fans care as much as if she was still alive. Also if Hawkeye had died, his daughter -who we saw shooting a bow and arrow in the first few minutes of the movie- could assume the role of Hawkeye or Ronin. I feel that fans would appreciate that more than having an irrelevant avenger sitting around. \n\nSecond, in Endgame they completely devalued Thor and Hulk. They build these characters up throughout many films and then they threw it all away for the big finale of the movie which did not please me or many other fans.\n\nLast, Endgame should have been split into two movies. They could have shown the impact of having half of the population snapped away and not have that responsibility fall into other MCU films like Spider-Man: Far From Home. That also could have given us more character development and reasoning for all of the big changes that happened between all of the avengers.\n",

Endgame is the Avenger's movie, and focuses for the most part on character. Each and every character dealing with the grief of who they've lost.\n We see some of our favorite heroes at their absolute lowest. But, like heroes do, when there's even a little bit of hope, they gotta take it, whatever it takes. \n Now being what the MCU's been leading to the past decade, you really need to have been watching these movies as they were coming out to really understand it all. That being said, if you're like me and you've been keeping with these movies as they came out, you'll definitely enjoy all the callbacks to previous films.I enjoyed this one scene, if you're caught up with the comics, there was this controversial Captain America comic a few years back, the movie had a short scene referencing it and I couldn't stop grinning. \n Now it wouldn't be a superhero movie without any action, and the final battle of this movie is by-far the biggest final battle I've ever seen. It didn't have a single dull moment. \n Overall, this is the film they've been leading too ever since the first Iron Man movie came out back in 2008, and it's been quite a ride, and one hell of a finish   ",

The movie loses 1/2 (the other 1/2 for the nonsense) a star for me because of captain marvel, I just can't stand her. I don't get how they could get all the other female superhero characters so right and get her so wrong. There is one scene in the movie that might explain what went wrong. In the final battle all the big female characters get together and kick as. This would have been a great scene if they had just let it flow within the movie. They however try so hard to make this some kind of statement that it's cringe inducing. I think the same thing went wrong with captain marvel, they tried to hard to make a statement instead of a compelling character. Hope they can fix this for the next set of movies.\n",

            "content": "Infinity War was clever. Endgame is just silly. You could write a novel about all that is wrong with it, but let's mention the most glaring examples:\n1. Time travel. Never use it as a plot device. It becomes dumb,  and removes any sense of consequence. It is basically a reset button. And Endgame takes the price for amount of self contradictions when clumsily making use of it.\n2. Thanos was an interesting character in IW; here he is just a cartoon villan.\n3. Everything with Thor. Ragnarok identified him as a true god of thunder; the hammer was just to focus his powers. And now suddenly Steve Rogers can call lightning?\n4. Political correctness. Cap's main motivation for several movies has been his old pal Bucky, but now at the end it's suddenly black wing guy who gets the final moments with him and takes over the shield? I guarantee that was NOT the original plan. There's lots of PC in the movie, but this is the most glaring example. Another grating example is the whole presence of Captain Marvel; over-powerful, and yet useless.\n5. Humor. In IW it was clever. Here it is mostly reduced to fart jokes.\n6. Don't just copy yourself, Russos. The soulstone sacrifice in IW was moving. Here I could not give a shit.\n7. Thanos, again. In IW a handful of Avengers almost defeated him when he had the glove and most of the stones; they only failed because of the emotional stakes (again, clever). Thor bested him after he got the whole thing. And in Endgame the whole lot of them, including supergirl cannot get in a good punch when his only weapon is a big axe?\n\nThere's tons more, but I'll pause at that. Final thoughts:\n\nInfinity War was clever and more importantly full of tension, from the very first scene. Endgame was boring, and more that a little annoying. I found myself distracted by my phone whilst watching it, which only happens with really bad movies. What bothers me the most is that is makes a mockery of all the ground work laid down by the best of the Marvel movies; Winter Soldier, Ragnarok, Civil war, Infinity War.\n\nIt is comparable to Alien 3 after Aliens - there are good moments but you mostly want to un-see it.",

It was funny, action packed and emotional, and finally gave Tony Stark a redemptive arch which he slightly gained in the original Iron Man movie. The cast is superb, the effects groundbreaking and, hear me, I felt Marvel has raised a bar it cannot beat. Overall, an EPIC movie. ",

I am literally suspicious of the 94% rating.  There are many drawn out personal moments with certain characters that I didn't want or need to enjoy this movie.  They just seemed gratuitous.  Also, I can't stand Captain Marvel.  I think it's absurd to have a moment of peril that isn't resolved cleverly, but rather by having a sexist super-hero come barging in to save the day.  Oh, how convenient.  I expected something far more clever with how they would solve all the problems at the end of Infinity Wars.  I will clarify that I really liked Infinity Wars.  In fact, I think it very well may be the best movie of the Avengers franchise.  So, to conclude, I didn't like this.  Perhaps I didn't like it because I'm changing personally.  I'm just not moved by the superhero nonsense anymore.  I also don't like that they had to end this one by taking away a very beloved character.  I'm not gonna say which one.  My personal opinion is that the rating on this movie is a fraud.  Or the alternative is that I refuse to accept that it's a good movie, so my mind is contriving excuses.  As always, it is a movie with exceptional special effects.  It's just that no amount of that crap can make up for a good story or lack of heart and soul.  Everything these days has to shove some politics in one form or another down our throats.  That right there is a big part of the problem to me.  Captain Marvel, and the man-hater actress that plays HER, are as lame as lame can be.  Remember good old marketing?  Well, any marketing blitz that has \"you're sexist if you don't like it\" as their slogan can surely do without my viewership or dollars.  Sorry, but yeah.  Oh, I done did politicize it.  Too bad.  The movie is a deliberate child's fiction after all.   ",

Here, Endgame is 3 HOURS, is A LOT slower paced, and allows our characters to interact on a much more personal level! 😃😃 Damn, that’s my main problem solved right there. \nThe first half is very slow, I’ll give it that. But honestly, I didn’t mind! This is just character building, and after 22 of these movies, the slow pace feels earned. The first half is still REALLY funny & entertaining, even if it is expectedly darker and slower.\nSure, sure, this isn’t as crowd-pleasing as Infinity War, UNTIL THE SECOND HALF. 😂😂😂 Then, it easily turns into every bit of crowd-pleasing satisfying Marvel action you’ve been waiting for. It does play like “Marvel’s Greatest Hits”. I won’t dare spoil a thing, but expect to have an amazingly fun time!\nAs a finale to the Marvel Saga, this sh*t is close to perfect. Every plot line wraps up so beautifully, it reminded me just of the ending of Logan. Through 11 years, I won’t lie when I say I got teary-eyed by the end. There is grace in its failings, but it’s been a privilege to be among this whole franchise. \nA-/A\n“A thing isn’t beautiful because it lasts.”",

That film felt fresh again and reinvigorated my interest in the franchise. Unfortunately Endgame shot it right down again. Time travel really was the most predictable and worst choice the could have made. The comics have always had the problem that nobody stays dead, and if it weren't for the fact that actors age or move on this solution would have opened the same can of worms for the MCU. Still it does rob the deaths in Infinity war from much of their gravitas, which left me rooting for Thanos to pull it of again, perhaps this time killing exactly the other  half. Perhaps this is why they made Thanos feel more like a one-dimensional villain than in Infinity war. \n\nIt isn't a bad film by any stretch of the imagination but for me atleast it lacks any real emotional impact and madr me wish they had stopped at Infinity War.",

First of all, for a three hour movie, nothing happens for the first hour as we get to see all the remaining Avengers wallow in their self-pity for not having defeated Thanos in the prior film.  Once the Avengers have formulated their plan to go back in time, the plot is disjointed and moves between various characters in a haphazard incoherent fashion.  Of course, after three hours, we finally get to see the big battle between all the Avengers and Thanos and his army.  The battle scene is laughable with all super heros getting screen time to show how inept they are at defeating Thanos.  The battle scene reminds me of the battle scene from South Park's Imagination Land.   The movie is tedious and incredibly boring. The only entertaining aspect of this movie is watching fat drunk Thor.  If you really want to watch entertaining mindless drivel, watch The Bacherlorette or Naked and Afraid. ",

Paying more to fan service than something that could've made this the greatest movie in cinema with barley to none problems. But I had enormous problems with this movie. Captain Marvel seems to be cocky, Hulk becomes smart with only dialogue to explain it then to show it, and Captain America wielding Mjollnir was out of nowhere with no explanation what so ever (which I know fans were mad about in Age of Ultron since he made it bump a little). I think Captain Marvel should've been given more screen time and a great arch (I honestly don't like her; please fix Marvel). Hulk should've been shown to have been experimenting with Thanos' Gauntlet to resize the stones to snap everyone back but this backfires with him being stuck in the Hulk's body. And Captain America could've tried to catch the hammer but Thor screamed at him not to. But it lands in his hand and he looks to Thor in shock\n\nHonestly this movie could've used more work before being released",

Thanos the evil Mad-titan obsessed with collecting all Infinity stones: Soul Stone, Power Stone, Time Stone, Space Stone, Reality Stone and Mind Stone. Thanos defeated our heroes, wiped out half of all life in the universe and escaped. This movie is about the result of that defeat and how our heroes will respond. \n\nWhy the movie is great: The reason this movie is great is because it's the pinnacle on top of all the other movies in the MCU. It takes clues, places people and stories from all the other movies. You get to see the real human toll on the characters from their defeat. The defeat really wounded them and you get to see that. This makes the film more emotional, real and not disposable. \n\nThe three act break down like this - First Act - The aftermath of Infinity War, Act 2 - Time Heist, and Act 3. Final Battle.\n\nThe movie is interesting, mind bending, nostalgic, smart, funny, emotional, entertaining, at times violent, epic and in the end the most satisfy conclusion you could possible get from a movie experience.\n\nWatch this movie and you will realized you watched something that will never be replicated again. Maybe not even by the MCU. This not even Movie Magic - it's Movie Sorcery. What Marvel crafted here is nothing short of amazing.\n\nIt's a movie anyone can enjoy.

For a MCU admirer like me ; this film was disappointing to say the least. When infinity war ended, I was literally teared up by the experience I got. It boosted the hype, the anticipation to a new level! I was counting on the finale film to be the best I have ever seen in the MCU so far. But that dream, that wish of mine got shattered! Why? There are so many reasons behind it! Slow pace till the time travel sequences kicked up, lack of cohesiveness between the characters, not duly written script, lesser emotional impact ; all of these made the film less enjoyable for me. The only thing that saved it from being doomed for me is the Last 1 hour, the climax battle scenes are beautifully made. To have all the superheroes in one place and give proper screen times to everyone is a daunting task. They handled it pretty well! The performances especially from RDJ was memorable and touching at the same moment. Overall a decent film for my liking and for my expectancy that I had after The last film. It Should have been way way better. All of the True Marvel fans deserved it.",

A lot of the humor fell flat and where you could tell people where supposed to laugh, the theatre was silent. There was so much build up for Captain Marvel and she barely appeared or played much of a role in the story line. Fat Thor was just underwhelming.

Overall, I really do like Infinity War better.  At the end of the day, Infinity War was just a wildly new experience, it was such a gamechanger and crowd-pleaser.  Not only that, Infinity War I think had a better final battle.  This final battle, while boasting the biggest ensemble of Marvel heroes we've ever seen on screen, is weirdly dark and muddied in CGI scenery compared to the battle at Wakanda from Infinity War.  Also I hate Professor Hulk, he's just not that fun.  Okay so those are my criticisms, what did I like about the movie?  I guess everything else?  The time travel plot let's us revisit and honor some old moments in Marvel with a new lens in sort of a Back to the Future Part 2 way that's a lot of fun, and it brings back some characters I didn't think we'd ever see again.  The movie has a big emotional core, and a climactic end that is godamn powerful.  This movie juggles a lot.  Seriously this is like watching someone juggle 10 flaming chainsaws, it's a godamn miracle it works at all.  That it works this well is even more of a miracle.

This movie was a little bleak overall because it does take place after the snap, but it was still enjoyable with many scenes. Being a GOTG fan, of course I enjoyed Rocket belittling Ant-Man to a small puppy and Starlord dancing to \"Come and Get Your Love\", a flashback to the first film.

Even though it isn't my favorite movie in the MCU, it has to be top 5 for me. The beginning of the movie is quite slow, but don't worry because the final 2 acts make up for it. Such an emotional movie for fans of the MCU and even if you aren't an MCU fan, you will enjoy this movie and feel emotion toward certain characters. Fantastic movie and yet agian Marvel has created another masterpiece.",

And of course, seeing the finale to some of the best characters ever created, the ones we’ve followed for the past decade and the past 22 movies, was heart wrenching and done so so well. I could easily talk for hours about all the amazing things about this movie, but there’s one more I want to mention: the iconic moments. *SPOILERS* Cap catching Thor’s hammer. “On your left.” “I...am...Iron Man.” And the million other callbacks to the incredible universe Marvel has created, is just one of the reasons Endgame is a must see, and in my opinion, one of the greatest movies of all time.

            "content": "Avengers: Endgame is the ultimate payoff for ten years of Marvel movies. Full of surprises, Endgame thrills with exhilarating action and tons of inside jokes for longtime MCU fans.\n\nPicking up from the end of Infinity War, Thanos has decimated half of all life in the universe with just a snap, and the world is left reeling from the catastrophic actions of the mad Titan. The Avengers mourn their fallen comrades and plot to recover the Infinity Gauntlet and its stones in order to reverse Thanos's damage.\n\nI really like the story. Endgame is just as much about the fight against Thanos as it is about the Avengers dealing with their own losses. This film sees our heroes at the lowest they've ever been. Watching each character deal with pain and grief says so much about who they are and how far they've come. My one gripe with the story is a plot element is introduced that makes the movie more complicated than it should be and leaves a lot of questions unanswered. But for the rest, Endgame has so many wonderful twists I wasn't expecting, and the more predictable plot points are executed in an entertaining way.\n\nEndgame doesn't drag for a second. The film is fast-paced and its three-hour running time flies by. Endgame ties up all loose ends and didn't leave me wanting anymore than what I got. I really like the score by Alan Silvestri. Silvestri uses the rousing Avengers theme sparingly but masterfully. He also mixes in musical cues from scores in other Marvel films that really adds to the experience.\n\nThe main flaw in this film is the tonal inconsistency. Endgame, for the most part, jumps between quips and drama really well, but, sometimes those tonal shifts feel less effortless than they're supposed to be. \n\nFor all the build up to this movie, Endgame is a fantastic film and a brilliant conclusion to the Marvel saga. If you're just getting into the MCU, I don't recommend seeing this film, but if you're already a Marvel fan, you're going to have a blast. I give Avengers: Endgame an age rating of 11 to 18 for some sci-fi violence and quite a few scenes of peril. And I give it 4 out of 5 stars.\n\nReviewed by Benjamin P., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

The fact that these superhero characters in sci fi costumes have the ability to make so many grown men cry is a testament to the success marvel studios has had in bringing these characters to life. Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johanson, Chris Evans, Tom Holland, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeremy Renner, Karen Gillian and Elizabeth Olsen stand out the most to me with their powerful and emotional performances.",

Watching Thanos punch that Captain Marvel wannabe in her smug gob with the power stone was particularly poetic. However, I feel the heavy-handed fan service was equally gob-walloping in retrospect. And I think the lazy writing engendered more questions for fans than it answered, as evidenced by the litany of post hoc explanations offered by the co-directors.

The greatest things about this movie have to be the relationships of each characters and how they interact with each other. The camerawork of this movie is absolutely stellar and it is a visual treat from start to finish. The damage that infinity war had for this movie made it feel like that in general these movies can bring new scenarios of where the main hero doesn't always HAVE to win and there are consequences for not winning which brings more narrative weight to the actions and can be suspenseful of how our main heroes are going to get out of this one! I'd say the humor in this movie is also a step up from some of the humor of the earlier films which is a delight and can help with easing the tension. This movie like infinity war brings forth emotional moments, and intense moments. I had a small issue, the pacing in certain areas feels rushed but it doesn't ruin the movie!",

And that is okay, because to me the Avengers films were never why Marvel's Cinematic Universe works... it is the individual heroes and actors who really are interesting and their story arches that makes it great. Endgame celebrates that in their nostalgic time travel escapades and the actor do really well in all the mess of that. Also Cap and Stark get their ending here in a satisfying and memorable way, unlike other side characters.  \n\nI can't say I am likely to ever really like it.

I felt as if I was in the mindset of the characters and their motives were clear. The plot was pretty easy to follow despite some plot holes in the time travel aspect. The action was the best part of the movie aside from the comedy. The third act of a Marvel movie usually is the part where it all goes south, but surprisingly, the climax was entertaining and wasn't just a bunch of explosions meant to entertain those who only want to see their characters kick ass. Sure. There is plenty of that, but they did it correctly and the climax had a meaning to it. The movie did seem very slow in the first act, but it picked itself up gracefully.

Instead, I'd like to focus on the huge number of cameos and references this movie has. Almost every single MCU film gets at least a small nod here, which is to be expected for this big finale event. Everyone gets to have their moment (some more than others), and there is a healthy amount of fanservice, especially toward the third act.\n\nThe first act of the movie is verrrrry slow. Perhaps we have been spoiled, having grown accustomed to a big action set piece within the first 20 minutes of a Marvel film. There is an action sequence, but it is very anticlimactic, and leaves you feeling much as you did at the end of Infinity War, but at the wrong time. It seems they were trying to slow-roll the feeling of hope throughout the movie, but I felt we spent too much time at the bottom of the ladder.\n\nThere are many satisfying moments, and everyone is given their due by the end of it.",

I might add that there are some pretty cringe moments, like the Fortnite scene, but aside from that, it was able to show the effects that Thanos's snap in Infinity War has on the Avengers. We are taken through the lives of each and every Avenger, and we are finally able to see how they come back together and get past their problems to save the universe one last time.

BTW, this review contians from here on out. Captian Marvel was pretty good, only for the action sence. Only than that, her story wasn't that good. Got to expect that from her movie. When Iron Man and Nebula were stuck in space, and was the main anticipation from the first trailer, I wanted to know what will happen to him. But they spoiled it in the next trailer I was forced to watch. It was an ad on YouTube and showed that spoiler. So the next best thing was \"how do they survive?\" This is a story arc that has so much potential. Nebula could learn to trust people, or Tony's engineering could of been put to the test, but NO! Captian Marvel just flew up to the ship and saved them. Since I was anticipating so much for this, it left an unsatisfying feeling. So much for \"satisfying finale\" in the Critics Consensus. Also, look, Tony invented time travel out of the blue. How did he invent it? How does it work? Who cares?! Everything in the beginning is rushed and trash so far. Then a rat saved Ant-Man. All of the beginning is rushed. But him being saved by a rat could of silped under my radar this time, because he can't really have a story arc, or progress the plot in the quantum realm. But with all of this lazyness combian, who cares?! Then the most anticipated moment of them all, fighting Thanos. That was a big twistm and was a good one (in a story standpoint). Then there was the dramatic 5 ysars later. Pixar was known for showing, not telling. But clearly that wasn't the case. And it definitely affected most of it. I had no idea what to expect, and in a bad way. How are cities like? Did people get over their losses? Clearly, I had know idea. The 5 years later was a dramatic one, but it really didn't help the story. They could of put one year later, and then show the progress of the cities. Just. More. Lazynees. But after this point, I have to say, it was pretty good. Revisiting past movies was AWESOME. Fight sences were Marvel standards. And I would of said this made up for everything. But the ending isn't the best. The \"whatever it takes to deliver a satisfying finale\" in the critics consensus feel more of a lie. Tony dying and \"completing\" his story arc, didn't actually feel complete. He just died with a kid he never got to raise and wasn't satisfying at all. All the critical reviews are really true, and that's a problem.",

        {
            "content": "Before I get into the nit-picking of this film, I want to make it clear that I thoroughly enjoyed myself in the theater. The movie got off to a perfect start and had me on the edge of my seat, and the ending was probably the best thing I’ve ever seen in a theater. Overall, I loved it. It was emotional, truly shocking, and the PERFECT ending to this 20+ movie saga. Marvel did a great job with this franchise and they should be proud of creating a universe with this much depth and development, it’s a truly remarkable feat!                \n\nBut there were a lot of things I didn’t love: \n\nFirstly, I think that everyone can agree the biggest drawback of Endgame was the lack of fighting. It took up until the final 40 minutes of the film for any real fight to break out. Up until then, it was mostly just story with no real action or risk whatsoever, which REALLY made the the second act drag. Which is fine, because story development is important, but being a superhero movie it was really disappointing we had to wait almost 2 hours and 30 minutes for any fight scene to occur (minus the cap vs cap fight which was decent at best, but definitely not a substitute for the lack of action).\n\nSecondly, I hated what they did to Thor. Being my favorite character in the MCU, I was really disappointed with how they utilized him in Endgame. Instead of using all the remorse he was filled with from Infinity War as fuel, they channeled it in a completely different direction and made him somewhat of a loser. Now I’m not saying that being upset or depressed over a failure is something to be looked down upon, but for a character like Thor it made no sense to me. He had pretty much lost everything near and dear to him over the course of the MCU, but it never affected him to the point that he had given up on everything including himself, so it made no sense to me that he would suddenly change everything about himself and become far. I also felt like he was TOO comedic and wasn’t serious enough. I may be alone on this but I just didn’t understand why the Russo’s chose to go this route with such a powerful and mentally strong character. It felt like everything Taika Waititi did in Ragnarok was just thrown down the drain and all of the development of the character was wasted. I enjoyed the joke at first, but I wanted to see Thor return back to his headstrong and confident self, which sadly didn’t happen. \n\nFinally, my last issue arose with none other than the Incredible Hulk. My issue, however. was not so much with the character’s role and personality in the movie, but rather the fact that he got less than 30 seconds of on screen fighting time. That’s right, we saw one of the most formidable and savage characters in the Marvel Universe fight on screen for less than 30 seconds. To me, this is one of the biggest failures of endgame. Hulk is one of the most well known, if not THE most well known, characters that Marvel has. At the end of the day, Professor or World Breaker, Hulk is Hulk and the fans want to see the angry green monster get some action which we really didn’t get in this movie at all. It would’ve been nice to see Banner get a rematch with Thanos or even get a crack at one of the members of the black order. Some more backstory on his transition to professor hulk would have been nice as well. But otherwise, I really liked his role and importance to the story (something I felt was absent in previous Avengers films) and I’m excited to see this new persona play out in future films! \n\nSo in conclusion, Endgame to me wasn’t perfect like I thought it would be and I think there were a lot of things that could’ve been changed to make the film better. \n\nRegardless of all of these nitpicks, however, I still loved the film. So many moments and aspects of the film were done perfectly and had my draw dropping: \n•Thanos getting decapitated by Thor in the first 15 minutes which was then followed by a 5 year jump\n•Seeing Tony Stark’s daughter for the first time\n•The reveal of Prof. Hulk\n•Seeing Valkyrie, Meek and Korg\n•Fat Thor (even thought it was bittersweet)\n•The Ancient One Cameo\n•Thor getting Mjolnir back\n•Tony getting to say bye to his dad\n•The Trinity vs Thanos\n•The Return of the dead Avengers\n•Cap Wielding Mjolnir \n•Old Cap\nand of course, everyone’s favorites\n•”AVENGERS!..... assemble!”\n•”And I.... am.... Iron Man”\n\nI would definitely recommend seeing this movie, one of the most memorable moments of my life in a theater!\n\nFinal Rating: 9.1/10",

It's prequel, Avengers: Infinity War was a very good movie and built up so much for Avengers: Endgame and it was all just wasted. It should've been a darker movie like The Dark Knight or Logan, but the humor was going on the whole movie. Thor's ark was very useless and it should've changed either with the time machine that didn't work at the beginning of the film or right when Thor call's for Stormbreaker and Mjiolner. The Hulk and Hawkeye should've had at least one scene with thanos. We also should have had a mourning scene for Black Widow at Tony's house with Clint, Bruce, Steve, Nick Fury and maybe rhody to. The use of Okoye was also dissapointing.  I would've wanted her and Brie Larson's, Captain Marvel to go hunt down Thanos together or something that had to do with either of those characters in the 3 hours film. The only dramatic character arc was Nebula and now that Thanos is dead she'll have nothing to do besides join the Guardians of The Galaxy. Speaking of the Guardians, it was dumb to add Thor in and also Rocket was sad at the beginning because he lost all the family he ever had and then after the five year skip he's making jokes. Also, the re-release was horrible and it's a waste of money. The movie was very disappointing and I hope Spider-Man: Far From Home will be good.",

When they bought Marvel they said \"keep doing what you're doing\" and the passionate heads at Marvel succeeded in their long term goal of giving fans something truly satisfying, but when Disney bought Star Wars Disney said \"let's do whatever, because people will pay money no matter what\" and then they made that terrible movie.",

There was a Stan Lee tribute and a Spider Man Far From Home scene that we've seen half of in the trailer. VERY disappointing. I didn't see any additional footage beyond that. \nWhen seeing a movie more than once you start to notice holes in the plot. For instance, Thanos' whole premise doesn't make any sense. The world population in 1970 was half of what it is today. Why would wiping out half of the population help us? Is there mass starvation and suffering from lack of food? Not with commercial agriculture. So how could this genocide help a population? Especially wiping out half of all the livestock etc. Makes no sense...

I am lucky enough to call myself one of those people and Avengers: Endgame has now become my favorite MCU film. There is so much emotion and excitement in this film and I truly hand it to Joe and Anthony Russo. They weren't just asked to create a satisfying closure to Endgame or Infinity War, they were asked to bring a closure to a franchise with 22 movies in it. The fact that that they even succeeded a little is really impressive. What makes it even more impressive is that this film didn't just succeed a little, it shattered box office records and became a fan favorite. If anyone is planning to watch Endgame that enjoys Marvel but has not seen all of the movies, I encourage you to watch all of the movies before Endgame, because you will have a spectacular and mind blowing experience if you do.

This movie seem to drag quite a bit for me, from the first 2 hours of figuring how to get the stones to reverse what Thanos did in 1.  The interaction between Thanos and Avengers is far less enticing in this movie.  The action, plot and story seem to move along at a descent pace, but you already know what is going to happen, it seems like they could have done much better.  One of my biggest problems is the fact that The Hulk is once again a non factor joke.  He is the most powerful Avenger, yet he is sidelined for Antman?  I do like the movie but it is a far let down after the last movie without a doubt.",

On April 27, 2018, there was a car accident in my hometown. I didn’t find out until 2 days after the crash that a friend of mine was involved. When I found out about my friend she had 3 hours until they pulled the plug on her life support. She died the next day. Then when Endgame came out on April 26, 2019, I looked at tickets just to see how popular it would be and saw 1 ticket for it!! I snagged that ticket faster than a super soldier can run!! But what I didn’t realize until after I had purchased my ticket was that I was going to see Endgame on April 27, 2019, exactly 1 year after the crash that took my friend. I went anyway and saw Infinity War for the first time right before I went. And Endgame helped me get the closure I needed after my friend’s death. Walking out of the theater after the movie was pure bliss. I felt like myself again!! And now I can watch Infinity War without feeling like I’m responsible for what happened!! I can watch it and just enjoy the movie and not blame myself for my friend’s death!! When Endgame comes out for purchase you can bet you bottom dollar that I will get both Infinity War and Endgame!!",

I remember getting my allowance and walking hours to the nearest comic shop store to follow Marvel West Coast Avengers, Spider-Man, Hulk, Wolverine and Chris C's writing on the X-men. Now years later I met Stan Lee in person and saw \nAvengers: Endgame in IMAX 3D and in 4Dx. This film perfectly wraps up every story arc from the past MCU movies and brings the journey of the six original Avengers either full circle, a demise, or a happy ending. Exept where is Quicksilver? Why didn't Scarletwitch absolutely mention they should bring her brother back from the dead? Only really a few things bothering me about this film. I really was hoping to see a 'homage' to Grey Hulk or an angry furious Hulk fighting Thanos for the second time. Rather then where that character of Hulk was sort of sidelined and confirmated in smarts alone. We also never had the pleasure of seeing a real life version on Hawkeye's original Hawkeye mask. I'm sure a realistic way of emplimenting this can be included in someway. This could have been shown so it can be passed down to his daughter later on in future content.\n",

With that, it is understandable that people are sad, so it serves no purpose to show how this drove Hawkeye mad and end up killing bad guys in Japan. Instead, these scenes should be replaced with longer fighting scene when Thanos and his troops arrived on Earth. The fighting scene is the most crucial part which get the audiences' adrenaline pumping. Perhaps it should include fighting scene between Marvel superheroes with Children of Thanos such as Ebony Maw & Proxima Midnight. Maybe MCU should shoot this and relaunch an extended version. Pretty sure if this happens, Endgame will easily cross US$3 billion mark worldwide.   ",

It does everything a second of a 2 part story should, picks up immediately from where we left off, with our heroes at their lowest, gives the bitter taste of the Infinity War aftermath a chance to sink in, and then breathes fresh impetus into the remaining heroes when it seems like all hope is lost, culminating in a quite simply thrilling final battle. The focus is redirected towards the Avengers themselves, after the preceding film had mainly focussed on Thanos as almost the main protagonist, there were moments where the scale felt a little uneven, due in part to the attempt to balance the reduction of the primary cast to a select few with the expanded timescale of the film at nearly three hours, but it was definitely discernible as a three act epic film, and whilst I think Infinity War is the better picture, Endgame gives us far more satisfaction overall.",

First, the first 2 hours were an absolute bore. People around me literally fell asleep. I probably would have too if I wasn't fuming mad. Second, the time travel explanation was far less plausible than in \"Back to the Future\" (even though \"Endgame\" tried to diss \"Back to the Future\"). \"Alternate timelines\" is too hokey to suspend your disbelief but it sure gives Kevin Feige lots of future storylines to play with. (And btw, why so easily dismiss the legit proposal to go back in time to kill Thanos when he was born?) Third, the fight scenes with Thanos were not believable. Stormbreaker in \"Infinity War\" could break the power of six Infinity Stones (think about that!), but in \"Endgame\" it couldn't even break a simple metal weapon wielded by a Thanos with zero Infinity Stones (and that same metal weapon could also inexplicably break Vibranium...mm hmm, convenient). And naturally, heroes only take on Thanos one at a time. \nBut wait...there's more! Whiny Fat Thor is unlikeable. Professor Hulk (who also was borderline unlikeable) was inexplicably MIA during the big fight. Iron Man's sendoff lacked any emotion. Captain America's ending seemed selfish and contrary to his character. Humor was fatally lacking. Gratuitous gay partner mention.

Why does Marvel insist on epic battles now? It never started out that way. Ironman was perfect in that it was a small internal strife to deal with (btw, the whole plot of Ironman is that other nations will try and build their own battle armour but after 20 years they still haven't?) \n\nThe shouldn't have pulled Thanos into the current timeline like they did. I like that he was mixed in some how, but it should have been subtle event. The whole closed time line scenario is brilliant. I was was happy. It's rare for a show to get time travel right. There are only a few directions one can correctly follow, and Avenger's started that so well. But than they had to have Thanos come through. Maybe it would've been interesting if it was just a handful of them and the reset returned him memory-less, but the entire ship and army? ... I'm sorry but this looses stars. \n\nThe individual story arcs were fantastic. I realise there was no way to adequately follow them all. But the ones they did focus on were fantastic.

This is expressed when all the disappeared avengers come back to fight against Thanos's army, in which the final moment which Steve gives the ‘Avengers Assemble' charging into the final chilling moments of the rest of the movie.\nThe most shattering finale reveals Tony Stark taking the sacrifice to save everyone. In what started the MCU with Robert Downley Jr's iron man, it's the final moment in which tugs our heartstrings that the Tony Stark we knew has ultimately overcomes his fear and his comfort to pull off the greatest emotional moment in MCU or perhaps of the decade.\nOverall, one of the best.

The movie starts off with moments after Infinity war,  showing us the avenger, not in the last one Hawkeye and shows us what he loses. The Movie continues to a shot in outer space showing us a lost spaceship and showing us how the lost avengers came back to earth. Then they show how nothing could be changed. Then Five years later Ant-Man comes back shocking the Avengers with an idea which gives the heroes the lost hope. They re-assemble the team with the help of tony stark. They accomplish the goal and gain what is needed. Then it leads to an astonishing battle with all the heroes vs the villains army where the special effects are through the roof. You get everything you ever wished for in this battle. Then it ends with an epic plot twist and sadness.\n    This movie is easily a 9.3/10 it a tremendous movie with a lot of work put into it and came out to be a terrific movie making about 7.1 billion dollars making the second most amount a movie has made at the box office. This movie is the perfect movie has all the things humor, adventure, sci-fi. It also has many easter eggs only the comic book readers would get.

Despite Rotten Tomatoes giving it a generous approval rating, it was honestly at best a 2/10. I don't even know where to begin but here is a list of a couple of issues I had *SPOILERS*: \n\nNo grieve/connection with the death of Tony Stark as the movie proceeded to direct its attention back to Captain America \n\nThe killing of Thanos early on in the film and the introduction of one from a different timeline who did not know anything that happened in Infinity War left a sour taste in my mouth. Even if it was necessary, it was a swift and emotionless death. It was from then that I knew this movie would not be so great. \n\nWhat exactly was the purpose of Captian Marvel? Her standalone movie (I felt) did pretty well and I expected her to have a bigger purpose in Infinity War but all she really did was save Tony Stark -> Dipped -> returned to destroy Thanos ship? \n\nI would say some of the bright spots I saw throughout the movie was the character development of Ant-man and Nebula as well as the aminations towards the fight scene(s). Nebula I felt was a very important factor towards making sure the 'New Thanos' understands what happened in Infinity War. Without her, this would have been a total shitshow.   ",

They all could have chosen to keep what they had and ignore the rest, as we humans a lot of times choose to do, but what makes them super is that they choose to sacrifice and to serve, especially Iron Man.

It's my favourite movie of the year too, but I've only seen like ten or so 2019 releases, and this is the 22nd Marvel Cinematic Universe film, so that seems far and away the bigger deal. I can't say it's perfect, there's some conflicting stuff within its own runtime that really doesn't seem to gel (though a re-watch may prove me wrong on that), and it's not like every moment was the no-holds-barred-zero-exception best version of that moment from start to end. But God I loved this thing.\n\nI will say this though, the reason that I loved it, is this thing is fan service galore. If you do not care for the franchise's 21 movies preceding this point, then Endgame is not the movie to turn you around on that. That may come in a future installment, but this one is a culmination. It's the end of Infinity War but also Phase 3, but also a wrap-up and genuine ode to/send off for everything that Marvel has done over the past 11 years. That to me was incredible, and I am eternally greatful, but I cannot imagine it working for people who have no vested interest in these characters.\n\nTo me though?

Though there are some major issues that arise when creating a cinematic feature that brings you back to scenes within it's predecessor films.  One major issue is a change in the future, where there will be 2 Captain Americas, during the same time.  So, how do they not meet each other, especially when Captain America meets Margret Carter in the hospital within the movie Captain America: Winter Soldier.  Where is future Captain America at her deathbed, and why wasn't the picture older version of him.  Also, how does going back to the past, not affect the future at all when they teleport after their missions.  Another huge plot hole is, Iron Man and Nebula's ability to walk on earth after being in space for 22 days, umm muscular atrophy applies to this case.  How does a normal human being sustain so much damage to his left arm, shouldn't his arm just disintegrate after using the infinity gauntlet.  Only by being in denial that those extremely large plot holes, don't exist, does the movie feel enthralling.  All in all, sometimes there needs to be more realism even when creating a movie about super beings.  Though, the overall story was excellent, but it isn't perfect.",

There are too many issues to name but the one big one is once Thanos puts on the guantlet...GAME OVER...just like the last movie he wins bc he has the 6 most powerful things in the universe that only he's strong enough to command or ppl on his power level can use.  The fight is over, the snap is just a fun dramatic pause..but the power is immediate and it's over once he has it on...they should have never let him get it and at least the end would be somewhat plausible.  That being said I still love the smart ambition to say we're going to do this and it's going to take 10 yrs.  When most times Hollywood has no patience (ie: Justice League and DC movies) I loved the movies overall and it's still an incredible accomplishment in movie story arch's from Marvel.  Hopefully changing the timelines will allow Marvel to bring in the X-men since Disney has now bought Fox and all it's characters they had the rights too.  I'll suggest a huge story arch through all the character's movies with the villain Kang the Conqueror next.  I know you non-comicbook ppl don't know who he is but just Google him and you'll see how cool that story line could be and how it can just naturally work as a transition from Endgame.\n",

Does nobody speak with Nebula about what finally happened with Thanos and her sister?), almost creating more disaster than they pretend to fix. But I must recognize they save somehow some of the obstacles they put themselves (including justification of Strange behaviour, that, well, it's so, so, but at least says why Stark had to survive). What they do very good is to manage emotions, symbols, ideas which indicate the end of an era (sometimes it looks one of these chapters for summary of TV series, as \"Best moments\"), and how much all this work and stories have created, closing some of the arcs in logical ways. A little forced sometimes (fans of time travel are horrified) but, somehow, it works.

For the biggest comic book universe on the big screen, many of the films in the MCU have thus far hidden from some of the more comic booky traits such as time travel and multiverses. But Endgame delivers as possibly the most comic booky films to date. Unlike the overstuffed Infinity War, this film focuses on fewer characters and as a result each has a chance to shine and to do something meaningful, at least until the huge fight at the end. But perhaps most important, it focuses on the original Avengers and gives them a chance to play hero and in some cases, say goodbye. The visual effects have been better than some of the previous marvel movies and the action, whilst not necessarily better has been consistent with past ventures. The biggest shock is the emotion it evokes. As a moviegoer who doesn't generally get worked up during films, there are a couple of moments where there was a tear in my eye. It is bold and that boldness creates suspense and emotion. A fitting end to phase 3 and the Infinity Saga... At least it would have been if Spider-man Far from Home wasn't the official end.      ",

Felt like the best way to end the franchise. And this should have been the end of the franchise. Not even having a post-credit scene helps make it feel like the true end of the series.\n\n",

Then they build up a strong female character in Captain Marvel to use her for like 8 minutes.  Kevin Feig said she was the most powerful of the avengers but she does nothing in this movie, untill the scene where all the female heros help her try to get the gauntlet a say she is not alone.  This was a pat on the head to all female fans saying \"see we didn't forget about you\"  too many characters doing to many things.

Second, I have no problem with the new found ability of Captain America and Thor's hammer. The issue is he was also able to throw and control lightning which is a power that does not come from the hammer. This power comes from Thor himself as shown in Ragnarok.

For a three hour long movie I don't think alot actually happened in this movie. For all its grandiose its essentially \"We must gather the magic rocks so we can undo what the evil space wizard did!\". This simple dragged out plot can be forgiven because this is a character's driven story and boy does it have alot of 'em. But for as well written the characters are I cant say the dialogue is 100% stellar with serious and emotional moment's being undercut by witty sarcasm or the \"stark snark\" a style of humour that I don't personally appreciate but the others in my theatre seemed to enjoy it so who knows maybe I'm the one who's missing something.

I think Tony, Steve, and Nat all had beautiful endings.\nMy only issues with the movie was most importantly, the fact that they stripped Thanos of all of his character development from Infinity War. Obviously he wouldn't be the broken man he was at the end of that movie, but I wish he wasn't all Mad Titan. My other issue was Hulk. I think they should've had Hulk's and Bruce's merging happen throughout the movie instead of just showing it, but I still like what they did. Also I wish Hulk fought with Thanos again, after what happened at the start of Infinity War.\nAside from that I think its a great movie and the second best, first being Infinity War which I believed had a much better story.\n",

The movie starts off really slow, then Ant-Man shows up, and things get moving. From there, the pacing of scenes and sequences is more akin of Infinity War--where every scene kept the plot moving. ",

I thought Thanos would be a little more bad ass. All in all, it was all predictable. Iron man being the one to save the day was iconic.

It's not a wholly perfect movie, but it's certainly a damn good final chapter to an unforgettable journey. ",

There’s no emotional moments apart from the ending, which completely went against its own rules of time travel. SOOOO much filler. For a finale of an epic franchise like this, make a movie equal to or better than Infinity War. I recognized all the callbacks, but it’s hard to appreciate when fat MF Thor is bumbling around. I was hoping for a serious movie and Thor wasn’t comical at all. It was so distracting seeing the most powerful avenger in battle gear with a huge ass belly. No to mention, Thanos without the Infinity Stones is somehow more powerful than Thanos with. His sword makes ZERO SENSE, he’s untouchable, and makes everyone feel like a wimp. When he dies, I couldn’t care less, he wasn’t a mad titan, he was another damn Ex Machina like Nebula and Captain Marvel. Two stars",

Being a fan since the start and growing up watching every single marvel movie in theaters and seeing such a beautiful ending to the Infinity Saga was amazing. I recommend everyone to watch this film in IMAX because that extra 26% of screen is definitely worth it. Now on to the movie. No spoilers! Let me just say this movie blew me away and has finally taken my No. 1 spot for favorite Marvel film, and more than likely favorite film ever. The story is AMAZING! From the start of the movie you feel the pain and suffering from the devastating consequences from Infinity War. This movie has some of the most iconic movie moments ever! Without spoiling anything let me just say it’s definitely the best Marvel film ever! It has amazing CGI, cinematography, a beautiful score, and an amazing cast! I’m truly blow away!

Still, I like to see the films that get a lot of attention by all facets of the public, especially the kids. I want to see what they are seeing, to stay somewhat in tune. And so, two grandkids and I went to see The Avengers Endgame.  These superhero adventure movies usually embed some good messages, and Endgame does not disappoint. The arc of failure and redemption, the quantum do-over that allows for personal healing, gives us a tender teaching for today's world of judgment, separation and hateful expression and actions. Forgiveness is the operative. Not of the Other, but of the Self. \nIn Endgame, we experience the everyday person that lives in the super hero. Said an alternative way, it is the super hero that is alive in the everyday person. Along side this profoundly human tale, there is a courageous and spiritual story, one that takes into a a multi-verse of our own existance, a chance for another take into Being Self, an homage to the superhero in us, in each person.  It brought tears to my eyes and fullness to my heart.\nIn the final analysis, it is a Eulogy and Homage for sure, for Stan Lee, and for all the heros who choose to be in service to saving the world. It is, however, not the end-as-we-know-it, but a far-flung quantum trail into parallel worlds where we live life as we will and our dreams come true.\t",

            "content": "(26APR2019) Nothing like this has happened in the history of art.\n\n(02MAY2019) \"I am inevitable.\"\n\nIn 2007, the very idea of Marvel Comics making their own movies was laughable. They chose \"Iron Man\" as their first attempt; they couldn't use Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four, or the X-Men. The casting of Robert Downey, Jr was inspiring, but only to those who knew the character. To the rest of the world, he was an addict and therefore a potential problematic actor to work with. To direct this movie, they picked Jon Favreau, who had done \"Elf,\" hardly an example to submit when applying to direct an action movie.\n\nThen, with the one-two punch of successes of \"Iron Man\" and \"The Incredible Hulk\" (yes, that was a success), the experiment of a multi-film franchise following different characters but SET IN THE SAME UNIVERSE went underway, culminating in 2012's The Avengers. The successes of all of these movies have created this Mandela effect remembering an inevitable long-term plan that has led up to Avengers: Endgame.\n\nBut despite the reality of the riskiness of this entire franchise, the world has come to accept that the success of Endgame is an inevitability, meaning that the standard for success is unbelievably high. And yet, Endgame succeeds and then some.\n\nThis movie (and the others before them) isn't meant to instruct or educate. Yes, Captain Marvel, Black Panther, Winter Soldier, and Civil War tackle some pretty heavy cultural issues with regards to racism, sexism, government oversight, paranoia, and xenophobia, but that doesn't mean that those messages can't also be part of an entertaining experience. With Endgame, it's about grief, life, family, and living.\n\nThe key to this movie's success is the respect it pays to the entries that came before it. It pays respect by treating the other movies as reference points, to the degree that even character's orchestral theme songs are heard; these themes aren't recycled, they're paid homages.\n\nIt is a testament to the power of this franchise (from the studios, to the performers, to the directors, to the musicians) that the emotions that are elicited from watching this movie are felt through disparate audiences worldwide. How powerful must a work of art be when audiences outside the U.S. cheer and roar in support of a man decked out in the stars and stripes and is named \"Captain America?!\"",

Gawd. \n\nI did like that Iron Man was the one to make things right.

This pains me, but they almost made Thanos just as strong without Infinity Stones as he was with them. It makes no freakin' sense. Cap time travel questions... In the end he gives his shield to .... Falcon??? How will he even carry it?? Bucky makes the most sense. Stupid SJW crap. It pops up and ruins everything. Infinity War was solid. This, unfortunately, is not as good.

In the first Avenger, Steve accused Tony of never doing anything for anyone but himself, in his death he finally showed his sacrifice and concern for others and put them above himself.

But there are key character developments that occur that may upset Marvel fans (myself included). I wish more time could've been spent on these subversive developments to prepare fans. I was able to get over this on second viewing. I felt the beginning could have been paced better. Overall, movie doesn't feel like a 3 hour epic and I didn't want it to end.

This movie franchise has every actor your mom knows, every actor your aunt knows, every actor your sister knows. This movie has something lame for everyone. Lots of lame wise crack captain americas butt jokes. Speaking of Captan America I'm confused by the idea that at the end of the movie he never became Captan America?? Yes he has a shield and I guess can now summon Thors hammer? Wait, if he was never captain America then that would mean he never existed in this movie? Now I've gone crosseyed. So lost and boy what a cluster luck of actors that I guess where born to play the role of these superheroes from decades ago. Never has there been so many has beens on one movie scene..EVER!",

This movie will manipulate your emotions with its humor, heart-breaking moments, and moments that will have you cheering and jumping out of your seat. However, be warned, this is a 3 hour long movie. It seems the only good times to go use the restroom are when the San Francisco title appears on the screen, when Hulk goes to lunch, and when the title New Jersey is shown. These are also all in the first half of the movie, although the New Jersey one might be cutting it close to the second half. Overall, an absolutely phenomenal movie, but take caution if you have a weak bladder. (But it’s still worth it either way)",
