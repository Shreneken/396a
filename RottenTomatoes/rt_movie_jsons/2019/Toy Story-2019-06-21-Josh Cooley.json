I would definitely recommend it. \nFrom an adult point of view, there are some scenes that seem really absurd, like the scene where they put the car on the merry-go-round or the fork in the air suicidal. But I'd definitely watch it again and enjoy its little goofs. I didn't like the ending, but that's about it.",

It is a great movie even though it didn't really need to exist. The issues with it is it's lack of screen time on the other legacy characters, they barely say anything and are just there doing nothing, even Jessie doesn't appear that much. Buzz has this stupid joke where he listens to his toy phrases that is just so dumb and the jokes aren't really that funny. The ending is another issue, Woody stays with Bo Peep to become a lost toy. It feels so wrong and honestly feels so betraying because he went with Bonny along with the other toys to keep being played with instead of just being in a box but he just ditches the toys and stays. The ending kinda sucks, but overall not as good as one and two and even three but a solid Toy Story film.",

The way they took Woody's constant self analysis of his life's purpose and brough it to a final resolution like that was phenomenal. I had personally always seen these themes deep in Woody's character, and I am so thankful they explored them in this way. All those lines about not knowing what he was if not a child's toy made me cry in the theaters. this was one of those movies where the whole audience left the theater with brand new personalities and new views of life. Truly a great finale to the Toy Story series and an exceptional study of Woody's character. 10/10 would recommend.",

I adore this franchise, but this film feels like it wasn't needed and everything about the third film has been ignored. I'm sorry if I come off as a bit harsh but my favourite film of all time is toy story 3 so Pixar following the franchise up with something like this just upsets me.

The movie is full of details that contradict the first three, and the original characters have all been sidelined to make way for all the new merchandise (which is really all they are at this point). Of what we actually saw of the original characters, it's clear that Pixar had no idea what they were doing and just ruined them. Buzz is a complete idiot, relying only on his voice chip for direction. Jessie has no longer gotten over fear of small dark spaces, and nearly has a panic attack sitting is a fairly lit closet WITH all the other toys. Rex's only purpose is to scream at misfortune, Dolly is a complete jerk, Mr Potato Head being quiet is understandable since Don Rickles died, but that doesn't mean that Hamm and Slinky should be silent as well. And the worst one of all is Woody. His character was so mangled that he isn't even loyal to his kid any more, and he is also dummed down to make Bo Peep be in the spotlight more. And last but not least, Forky. Need I say more? (well yes this is a review after all) Forky's existence breaks the whole franchise. He should not be alive because he is not a toy.

Yet despite that, the writing is so bad that I can't put it even as high as Cars 2 on a tier list. It just sucks. It's not funny bad, it's uncomfortable bad. It's like the entire movie is gaslighting you into forgetting about who the characters actually were. 0/10. One of the only movies that I genuinely would say that no one should watch.",

I will never understand how so many people liked this movie. Bo Peep is completely out of character for how she was in the first 2 films. I'm not talking about when we meet her again half way into the film, I'm talking from the very first minute of the film. The original toys literally get cast aside for all the new characters, including Jessie! Buzz has been reduced to an idiot who only knows how to push buttons on his chest. Woody completely turns his back on his kid to run off with Bo Peep, who treats Woody horribly mind u. Constantly talking down to him every chance she gets. Forky becoming a sentient toy completely breaks the rules and logic of the Toy Story-verse. The villain is completely evil who tried to rip out Woodys voice box, and when that doesn't work she manipulates him in order to get what she wants.....and she's rewarded for it. Sid, Stinky Pete, and Lotso all received some sort of punishment for their actions, but Gabby received no such repercussion. This movie is a joke. All the magic from the original trilogy is gone. The only small positive I'll give this movie, is the animation is great. So congrats, u went from a half a Star, to 1 full star rating for me. In my opinion, this film sucks, avoid it at all costs!!!",

One other thing I like is that the franchise doesn't really try to subtly \"vanish\" characters from the movies over the years. Not many characters are forgotten, and if they are, they make a comeback later. For instance, even Sid is in Toy Story 4 as a garbage truck driver. Really.

Toy Story 3 to me at the time had the best ending I've ever seen in a movie and a 4th installment to that franchise to me felt like it was threw away the significance of the epilogue of Toy Story 3. To my surprise this movie isn't just a typical Disney cash grab like some of their movies, this was very well done, even for a movie that I thought was unnecessary. It even had a tender, heartwarming ending as well as Woody parts ways with his old friends to live as a free spirit with his old friend and possibly romantic interest in Bo Peep and befriending her crew. Most would think that would be the perfect way to cap off a wildly successful franchise but hey, that's what I thought about Toy Story 3 and I've been proven wrong about that so we'll see how it all goes a few years if a 5th installment is made. Either way, Toy Story has left an illustrious legacy and has nothing else left to prove.",

It will make you laugh and tug at your heartstrings like the movies that came before it. It's also notable that the 3D animation itself has vastly improved since the very first movie. The characters that we've grown to love have been looking better and better with each sequel. Kudos to the writers for always coming up with witty and clever stories that are also exciting and unpredictable. Toy Story is definitely one of Pixar's best creations, it not THE best. I love how they've introduced new lovable characters in this movie. I also like how they've showcased Bo Peep, even if they had to cut back on Buzz's exposure. And as usual, the movie has a few moral lessons to impart on us. Some of these lessons are obvious and some are hidden. And like its predecessors, Toy Story 4 is going to make you smile, laugh and even shed a tear.",

Like, I enjoyed it, I'm giving it a positive review, but it's easily the weakest of the entire franchise, and I actually don't think it's that close. The biggest problem is that this isn't a \"Toy Story\" movie; it's a movie completely about Woody. Everything is around him, not the rest of the toys. Because it's the fourth film I guess they can do that, but imagine if like a seven year old went with his or her family to watch this movie. They'll like it, but are they going to remember characters like Jessie, Bullseye, and the rest of the gang like the other three films? No, they're just not. In the other three films it felt like the screen time for all the characters were perfectly balanced. In this movie, however, again, it's all about Woody. Another big thing is that the new characters are really either a hit or a miss for me. Like I love Duke Caboom, but not really that tiny officer toy thing. It's like the same thing that Toy Story 3 has, just more of a distraction, at least for me. Now, with all of that said, this is a really enjoyable movie to watch. Animation is great, I like the story enough, but what's not talked about is the setting. Putting this story in a carnival was such a smart idea, and it can lead to a lot of good \"action\" shots. So yeah, I'm recommending it, just don't expect the same impact the other films had. There was really only one scene that left a huge impact for me, and without going into spoilers, it involved Gabby Gabby, the villain. I would put on a lot more Pixar movies before this one, but I wouldn't mind taking this one out of the toy box every now and a then. Go to Disney+ and make you're own opinion on this probably ending of arguably the best animated franchise ever!",

It was a good movie, the worst out of the 4, but still good, Bo Peep returns with an important role, and many new characters. ",

            "content": "Toy Story 4 was pretty good. The animation was top notch and the best out of all of them. The story on the other hand needed some work. I honestly think that this movie should've had a subtitle under it because this feels more like a Woody movie than a a stand alone Toy Story film. I have no problem with it being a Woody movie but the movie is called Toy Story. With this I did expect the story to be about Woody and the toys not just mostly Woody himself. Sure the new characters like Forky, Gabby Gabby, Ducky and Bunny, and Duke Kaboom were memorable and fun to watch it just would've been more entertaining with the other toys that are there. However despite the movie's flaws there's a lot that I enjoy in this one. I enjoy Woody and Bo Peep's relationship. I actually enjoyed the father figure between Woody and Forky and I also enjoyed Bonnie experiencing school for the first time. However my favorite thing about this movie is the ending. I just loved how this movie ended. I really like the idea of Woody doing what he wants for wants he really wants to be with Bo Peep and he finally gets to do that is just so satisfying. This brings so much character development from Woody and opens the door to so many possibilities to tell knew and interesting stories for the toys. So overall was Toy Story 4 perfect? No, but it does do a lot of interesting things to not only keep you engaged but to also make you feel satisfied. 9/10",

It's a strange one to review because, had it been approached as a standalone project, I think it would've worked relatively well. As a successor to its preceeding - and close to perfect - trilogy... not as much - and not only because it fumbles over much of the same ground as 'Toy Story 2'.\nAside from the general atmosphere, which felt far less heartfelt, a lot of the toys' characters seemed conveniently changed to aid the plot. With some almost with completely different personalities, it was as though the whole gang (and the creators of the film) had forgotten everything they'd been through together prior to the events of this one. The bodacious Buzz and willful Woody we've grown to love seem now more subdued and melancholy: God knows that's what life can do to humans, but it didn't feel right for it to happen to them. On the whole, 'Toy Story 4' left me feeling less moved and more just... confused.\nThings weren't all bad, though. Naturally, as a Pixar film, the animation is stunning; at times, almost life-like. It's fascinating to see how much they've come on since the original film, and how different the characters look today (hint - they've changed physically as much as they have mentally). Randy Newman, as usual, provides a beautiful score and, as much as I have roasted it, the plot is quite nice - if at times a bit samey. There's also an abundance of sweet, sentimental moments - and laughs, largely owing to new characters 'Forky' and the dynamic duo of 'Ducky' and 'Bunny'. Really, this wasn't an awul film; it's not its fault it failed to live up to the huge standards set by the three that came before it.",

Instead, Woody separates from the gang and interacts with a bunch of new toys, and reunites with Bo Peep.

But more seriously, it also breaks all what was established in Toy Story 2 and 3 : that being a toy without a human who plays with it, is being a toy without love and purpose, is not worth it and not desirable. Toys are not supposed to have a life on their own.\nThe tone of this movie is really different from the three previous ones, and it feels like an unecessary false note, the ending of the third movie was perfect, why ruin it with this poor story which betrays the characters and previous movies\nAlso, in this movie the rules of this universe regarding toys' life / freedom of movement, are really pushed very far... close to break the suspension of disbelief",

Between Woody\u2019s constant whining, and the strange existential questions that these stories raise, I am never entertained and just feel emotionally manipulated. Yet even I, as a non-fan of the franchise, felt that the third film wrapped things up perfectly and there was zero need to delve into the world of Toy Story again. But Disney needed to create some new toys to sell, and keep this franchise at the forefront of consumer\u2019s minds, so we are given Toy Story 4: The Search for More Money. This movie is everything I hate in the Toy Story films and none of the good stuff. It\u2019s repeating so many of the same story beats from the previous films, and yet does it all with minimal appearance of the characters people have come to love from the other films. Instead we get a brief smattering of cameos from Andy\u2019s toys and even Buzz is relegated to an annoying B-story while Woody is the only familiar character on center stage. Toy Story 4 opens up a cornucopia of new logical inconsistencies with this entire universe they\u2019ve created, and makes no attempt to explain them. Let me just list some of the baseline logic problems that I struggled with while watching Toy Story 4: 1) Forky gaining sentience, 2) The fact that somehow he knows he is trash when the entire franchise is built on a film where a toy doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s a toy, 3) The idea that a decorated spork could become a favorite cherished toy in less than 24 hours, 4) The idea that a 5-year-old girl would preserve that piece of trash for an entire year without stepping on it and busting it in half, 5) The wanton disregard for any \u201crules\u201d that might have existed to conceal the fact that toys come to life, 6) And yet, the magical ability of all toys to know instantly when to go limp so they aren\u2019t discovered walking around, 7) The idea of an underground society of discarded toys living on the fringe seeking to be played with by random kids in a playground. There\u2019s plenty more, and by the end I was getting motion sickness from shaking my head so much. I suppose the intent is for me to look at Toy Story 4 with the eyes of a kid and experience the childlike wonder instead of getting bogged down in the minutiae. I might have tried that, however this is legitimately the first time I found myself completely bored with a film in this franchise. I didn\u2019t know what to do with myself. They tried to simulate excitement as the plot was always moving, but it never felt like it was going anywhere. The humor in the film was flat and I never once laughed. Even with the myriad of new goofy characters, they didn\u2019t strike a chord with me. I usually appreciate some of the humor in these movies, but the funniest characters in the franchise get maybe one line each. What was even more shocking was that Toy Story 4 did not get a single tear from me, I didn\u2019t even well up thinking I might cry. That\u2019s one thing that Pixar has mastered, and even in their lackluster efforts I find myself wiping away some tears. This one fell utterly flat. Toy Story 4 felt exactly like the cash grab I worried it was, and did nothing new or interesting (other than add more unanswerable questions about their universe, and create new toys to sell.) Needless to say, I was not a fan, this was the worst of the franchise in my opinion.",

            "content": "A masterpiece of film-making, story-telling and animation. Delightful and devastating in equal measure, it might well be the year's silliest and most soul-stirring film.\nTHE LOW-DOWN: 24 years ago, Pixar's Toy Story quite literally changed the face of animation as we know it. The film presented an entirely new way of telling a story, bringing characters to life via CGI - pixels over pencils, so to speak. At the same time, Toy Story set a new high standard for storytelling in film, proving conclusively that animated movies aren't just for kids. In the intervening decades, the franchise has even made a strong case in favour of sequels - demonstrating that they're not necessarily soulless cash-grabs. Toy Story 4 is very much a part of that grand tradition. This is smart, soulful, sublime film-making: somehow entertaining and profound all at once.\n\nTHE STORY: Sheriff Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) is trying his best to adjust to life with Bonnie (Madeleine McGraw) - the little girl who inherited Andy's beloved childhood toys at the end of Toy Story 3. Even though he's forgotten more often than not, Woody remains intensely focused on Bonnie and her happiness. This means going into full babysitter/bodyguard mode when Bonnie creates Forky (Tony Hale), a spork with twists of wire for hands and clumsy wooden popsicle sticks for feet. As Woody tries to keep the trash-oriented Forky safe, he's swept into an accidental adventure - one in which he meets old friends and learns new truths about who he is and who he has yet to be.\n\nTHE GREAT: Perhaps the most remarkable thing about Toy Story 4 is the fact that it feels like the natural, necessary final chapter of a story told in four parts. There's no way that any of this could have been planned when Pixar first introduced us to Woody in 1995, but the progression in both narrative and character development feels utterly organic. Woody has spent the last three films grappling with his existential fear of being lost, forgotten or replaced, from his first meeting with the brash Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) to the day Andy outgrew him and went away to college. This film challenges Woody - and his audiences - to think hard about second chances, about changing how you look at yourself, about finding and embracing a new purpose in life. As such, Toy Story 4 might be the most philosophical movie you'll see this year, in the best possible way.\n\nTHE NOT-SO-GREAT: There actually isn't all that much to complain about. The plot machinations can feel a little clunky at times, but Stephany Folsom and Andrew Stanton weave so much joy and humour into their screenplay that the film still zips along. As this is very much Woody's movie, fan-favourite legacy characters like Buzz and Jessie (Joan Cusack) inevitably end up taking a back-seat. Even then, however, they each still get moments to shine. You might find yourself both thoroughly amused and mildly annoyed by the antics of Ducky (Keagan Michael-Key) and Bunny (Jordan Peele), a symbiotic pair of new characters who were clearly inserted into proceedings for comic relief.\n\nFORKING FUNNY: Give it up for Forky, surely the best new animated character of the year. Voiced with a bewildered tenderness by Hale, Forky is a delight - a walking, talking identity crisis created out of one little girl's love and imagination. Even better? With his magnetic attraction to all nearby trash-cans, Forky is a fandom meme just waiting to happen. A close runner-up is daredevil stuntman Duke Caboom, who reportedly owes his ridiculously charming posing and personality to current internet darling Keanu Reeves' commitment to the role. Toy Story 4 even manages to make its main antagonist, Gabby Gabby (Christina Hendricks), both terrifying and endearing - although there are fewer shades of grey when it comes to her ventriloquist-doll minions, led by the determinedly creepy Benson.\n\nCOWBOY BLUES: Ultimately, Toy Story 4 belongs to Woody, and rightfully so. He is this franchise's Captain America, in more ways than one. This film pays loving tribute to Woody's big heart and unwavering, self-effacing loyalty, even as it shakes up his life and world-view when he encounters old friend and possible paramour Bo Peep (Annie Potts) again. (Bo, by the way, is now super-cool and as far away from a fragile damsel-in-distress as anyone can be.) Woody's decisions and revelations about himself will make you weep with the most complex and bittersweet of emotions. There is joy and sorrow here, hope and heartbreak, final farewells and new beginnings, often in the same moment. In other words, it's the stuff of life itself, and it's glorious.\n\nCREDITS WHERE CREDITS ARE DUE: You'll definitely want to stay throughout the credits of the film, which are peppered with closing scenes that are essential to tying up the overarching narrative. At the very end, you'll even be rewarded with a happy ending for one of Toy Story 4's most minor of characters.\n\nRECOMMENDED? In every possible way. Toy Story 4 is a masterpiece of film-making, story-telling and animation. Delightful and devastating in equal measure, it might well be the silliest and most soul-stirring film you'll see this year.",

The only nitpick I have for this story, is that Rex, Jessie, and Bullseye are practically cut out of the movie after the first 15 minutes, and Gabby Gabby is not as good as Lotso, but still a character that you feel got a good ending in the end. So 8/10, a nice conclusion.",

If you haven't watched the Toy Story series, it is basically about toys that come to life. There are stuffed animals, action figures, rag dolls, and yes, creepy ventriloquist puppets. I really thought Disney decided to make Toy Story 4 a horror sequel, but all they did was live by the motto \"to infinity and beyond!\" and prove that their creative universe knows no bounds.\n\nToy Story 4 follows the adventures of a group of toys led by a cowboy rag doll named Woody. These are the same characters from the previous movies, but now they have a new owner: a little girl named Bonnie. On her first day in kindergarten, Bonnie makes a new toy she calls Forky out of a spork and random materials from the trash. This simple creation is now the center of her life.\n\nThere is one problem: Forky only wants to stay in the trash, because...well, he technically is trash. However, Woody knows that this little spork is the most important thing in Bonnie's life. With the help of his friends, our protagonist tries his best to help Forky find his true purpose. \n\nThat turns out to be a recurring theme throughout the movie. Like Forky, most of the new toy characters struggle to understand their true worth. Woody meets these new characters on a trip with Bonnie and her parents to the carnival. Remember the creepy ventriloquist puppets I mentioned? They are the sidekicks of the antagonist, Gabby Gabby, who is a defective doll that lives in the carnival's antique store. She has a false idea that fixing her voice box is the key to finding an owner, which is why she attempts to steal Woody's voice box. In the end, something happens that gives her more than just material completeness. If you plan to watch this movie, expect to see interesting and complex characters!\n\nOverall, the plot is entertaining and dynamic, with bits of comedy, drama, and action. The lighting, atmosphere, and general cinematography are fascinating. Since I bought and watched this movie on YouTube, I couldn't resist the urge to pause the film and look at the toy material details and the realistic environment textures\u2014even the spiderwebs and dust in the antique store. That is also a good idea if you want to spot Disney and Pixar easter eggs. If I could change one part of the story, it would probably be the setting, since carnivals and theme parks are a bit overused.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend Toy Story 4. It amazes me to think that it was released in June 2019\u2014almost 24 years after the first movie. The series is older than me, but I have watched and enjoyed all four movies, which is why I am giving it a 4.5 out of 5. The plot, animation, and music are great. The film score is heavy and exaggerated in a good way, especially for younger audiences. The whole experience leaves me wondering: will there be anything more after Toy Story 4?",

Tim Allen is solid as Buzz Lightyear, but I kinda feel they don't use him - or the other originals - enough considering who they are. It is, though, cool to see an old face return in Bo Peep (Annie Potts).\n\nThere are some more new characters and yet again, like in the past films, they strike the right chords. Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele are, entirely unsurprisingly, funny in the roles of Ducky & Bunny. Christina Hendricks is a good Gabby, while Keanu Reeves amuses as Duke Caboom.\n\nThe film focuses on giving the viewer(s) extremely heartfelt moments and for the vast majority it hits as intended, though they do try to tug on the heart too much in parts. The animation is stunning, especially in the early scene with RC.\n\nIs it a thing everyone wanted? Most probably not. Yet is there fun to be had? Most definitely. For a third sequel, you gotta give respect to Pixar & Co.",

I like the animation, story, comedy, and characters. But I do have some nitpicks and some small plot points. First things first, Bonnie really, really wanted Woody in the third movie, but now she forgot him? Just like that? Maybe the movie could've shown how she got sick of him over time. And wouldn't her parents get rid of him if she's wasn't using him? They would probably think she has a lot of toys, and they would want to get rid of some of them, including Woody, and the rest of the old toys. And when Woody decided to go with Bopeep, ( sorry if I spelled her name incorrectly) wouldn't Bonnie, or her parents notice? I bet that eventually she would remember Woody, and want to play with him, then notice he's gone. Also, in the ending, when the duck and the rabbit, ( I forgot their names ) stayed with Woody and Bopeep, I realized I never saw them decide they don't want to go with a human. We never saw them change and I thought they still wanted to go with Bonnie. Another thing, sense Andy eventually grew up and forgot his toys, wouldn't Bonnie do that too? Doesn't that mean Woody's friends would be able to see Woody again when they have to leave Bonnie? Or are they just in an endless cycle of going to new children every time they'd grow up until eventually a child decides to throw them away instead if selling/giving them away? I guess so. And lastly, just an opinion of mine, I never liked Bopeep. And I didn't, and probably most people didn't need to know what happened to her. Most of us could connect the lines Andy know she was sold, thrown away, or given away. So, in conclusion, this is a good film, but it doesn't seem necessary. I would recommend it, but I personally wouldn't watch it too many times, because I like the first few films better. Specially the first and third one.",

            "content": "An unnecessary sequel without the charm of the original trilogy.\n\nJosh Cooley's animated Pixar sequel Toy Story 4 (2019) falls short of its predecessors by far. It lacks the warm tone and endearing purpose of Toy Story, Toy Story 2, and Toy Story 3 that told the tale of beloved toys watching their child owner grow into a young man and be okay with that. Toy Story's narrative is over before Toy Story 4 even starts, so I was apprehensive about why Rashida Jones' story would make this movie necessary to continue Toy Story's plot. \n\nWell, it's not. Toy Story 4 has to manufacture backstory for the long forgotten character Bo Peep, who was largely ignored in 2 and 3 in lieu of Jessie, so that she can suddenly come back into Woody's love life. Andy is gone and all his toys belong to the adolescent Bonnie, who is relatable as a little girl afraid of school, desperate to find a friend. So, Bonnie makes one out of a spork so that Toy Story 4 can happen. Andrew Stanton, John Lasseter, and Josh Cooley's writing is basic with obnoxious modern humor and standard narrative choices with little experimentation or risks. All the charming aspects to Toy Story 4 come from the fact that I already care about these toys because of the previous Pixar pictures.\n\nJosh Cooley's direction is fairly plain and lifeless as he takes you from moment to moment with little charm. The contemporary computer animation is as impressive and realistic as 3D computer graphics ever captivated me. I just wish Cooley had more style to his direction. Axel Geddes creates a slow pace with his lethargic editing. Toy Story 4 is only 100 minutes long, so why does it drag so much? Basic cuts and unfunny writing make scenes linger and jokes bomb. Jean-Claude Kalache and Patrick Lin's cinematography has some gorgeous choices with lights, shadows, and all the space the toys wander in, so at least the wide shots are neat. I most appreciate their gentle close-ups during all the touching scenes Woody shares with Bo Peep. Randy Newman's score is nice, but fairly understated as no songs stand out in Toy Story 4.\n\nI will say that I do adore Bo Peep's cool redesign into a strong, independent, complex woman with her own agency to choose her life. Her romance with Woody was always a highlight of the Toy Story franchise, so bringing her back in style was a welcome choice to me. Annie Potts is magnificent as Bo Peep with her same sweet and alluring voice, but with a tenderness and confidence new to Bo Peep. She is by far the best aspect of Toy Story 4. I hope Annie Potts gets more roles like Toy Story 4. I wonder if we'll see Bo Peep again sometime?\n\nI found Tom Hanks resplendent as the desperate Woody foolishly trying to save Forky all for Bonnie, only to have Bo Peep tell him he's wasting his time all for a little girl who will move on eventually. Hanks has been a steadfast pillar of emotional resonance with his affectionate and memorable voice acting as Woody throughout the Toy Story movies, so it is very cool that Hanks returned to give Woody a proper sendoff.\n\nTim Allen is solid as Buzz Lightyear, but he strangely gets little to do as Toy Story 4 is clearly Woody's farewell. I really enjoyed Christina Hendricks as Gabby Gabby. Sadly, Joan Cusack's delightful Jessie is almost entirely forgotten for this adventure. You can hear a plethora of nice cameos in small voice acting roles throughout Toy Story 4 if you are interested to listen in carefully.\n\nTony Hale is super annoying as the obnoxious new character Forky and I say this as someone that likes Hale normally. It sucks because Forky takes up a ton of screen time that could have been better delegated to old favorite cast members. Key and Peele are horribly out of place as Ducky and Bunny with awful characters. Madeleine McGraw is nice and believable as the little girl Bonnie. Keanu Reeves is pretty funny as Duke Caboom, but his vocal presence is almost too recognizable for me. He's a bit distracting. Ally Maki is terrible as Giggle McDimples as she detracts from all the poignant moments between Bo Peep and Woody with incessant commentary. I pretty much hated all the new characters from Toy Story 4.\n\nIn conclusion, Toy Story 4's finale with Woody making the tough choice to leave Bonnie and his friends so that he might finally rest and experience life by exploring the world with Bo Peep is a very optimistic and mature ending that I was not expecting. Woody got his happy ending, even if Toy Story 4 ends on a bittersweet note as he must say goodbye to all his friends. Pixar delivers a moving conclusion to the Toy Story universe, so I truly hope this is the last one. They are already stretching the material thin for a movie.",

Seriously, this movie looks almost real. It's shocking when you compare the animation from TS1 and 4. It was also great seeing Bo Peep back, being more of an independent character and badass with great interactions with Woody. It retains the charm of the first 3 movies as well. We see so many toys who just want a kid and Gabby Gabby is a great example of this. She's an antagonist but an understandable one because all she wants is a kid. The best part of this movie is Woody and I love how this movie shows how far he has come since the first movie, a selfess toy who wants to make other kids happy even if he's not loved and I know people have an issue with Woody leaving the gang but it makes sense because Bo Peep showed him being a toy isn't just about staying in a closet waiting to be played. There's more to do like helping other toys so Woody is still doing good in the world and obviously there's many exciting and emotional moments like the climax. It's not quite as good as TS2 and 3 though. It's a shame all the toys other than Woody are sidelined, Buzz is dumbed down and the movie definitely drags at times. Thay stuff just prevents it from getting 4.5 stars but I still adore this movie. Thank you Pixar for this.",

Then comes along the semi-suicidal spork and the crazy adventure where toys are lost and regained and Woody discovers another valuable life lesson.  At the end of the trail, there is yet another happy rescue for the toys but what about Woody?  Is it time for Woody to ride off into another sunset with Buzz or follow the carnival with an old flame?  \n\nApart from the wacky antics, there are these bittersweet scenes designed to jerk the tears out of any normal feeling human.  I mean I held it in but... it's tough and I'm wondering why...they're TOYS.  That Disney magic...evil if not ridiculous. \n\nThere is also the typical everyday setting made to look humorously macabre. This time it's the little antique shop of horrors. And let's not forget the cool new toy cameos.  Toy Story 3 had Michael Keaton as Ken and now we have Keanu as Duke Kaboom...and honestly that alone is worth the cost of a rental.  Yes, he Canada!",

And lo, there was much wailing and gnashing of teeth. They were gonna screw it up. Even if the movie is OK, it can't reach the heights of the first three. They cannot recapture the magic. Woe is us!\n\nTurns out, the magic is basically still there.\n\nThe weaving of old and new here is done masterfully. Familiar characters, new characters, returning characters, it all just works. Toy Story has always added a batch of new toys with each film, and the originality and fun of each one shines through here. It does come a bit at the cost of old favourites like Jesse and Rex, but the film still feels familiar.\n\nThe plot still feels Toy Story-ish without resorting to cheap fan service. It probably resembles the first Toy Story the most, but elements of all three films are there. The characters are still consistent as ever, and there is a wonderful mix of slapstick humour and genuine moments. True to form, Pixar makes you want to cry at the end.\n\nIs it absolute perfection? No, but it's pretty darn close. That being said, if Pixar tries to make another one of these, I will break into Pixar HQ and put cat hair in the water supply.",

Bo Peep has been completely revamped which is fine and her relationship with Woody is odd.  It's like they forgot that these two used to be together (however that works for toys)  Forky is the new guy and while he is important to the main story, he gets all the development he gets after 20 minutes.

The animation is, as one would expect at this point, captivatingly beautiful, and some of the best the series has to offer.

New characters are spot on (Forky, Duke Kaboom) adding to an already packed cast without the feeling of being overstuffed.

            "content": "Toy Story 4 is an animated comedy film produced by Mark Nielsen and Jonas Rivera in 2019. This film features Tom hanks as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz, Annie Potts as Bo Peep, and Tony Hale as Forky. With one Oscar, 47 other wins and 51 nominations, Toy Story 4 received a  97% from Rotten Tomatoes. I loved this comedy because it taught amazing life lessons while following a group of friends, old and new who worked to help each other.   \n\n \n\nThe story follows the toys' life after Andy leaves for college and gives his toys to Bonnie. When Bonnie starts kindergarten she makes a new toy out of a spork, named Forky. The friends embark on a road trip adventure and struggle to keep Forky out of trouble. When Forky wanders off into the open, Woody makes it his responsibility to return him safely back to Bonnie. On his journey to get back to Bonnie, Woody takes a slight detour and is unexpectedly reunited with an old friend from Andy's house.   \n\n \n\nThe movie starts in a sweet nostalgic way with the classic to the movie franchise, \"You've got a friend in me\" and shows Andy all grown up giving his toys to Bonnie, this scene ends showing Bonnies' name on Woodys' boot where Andys' used to be.  Woody struggles adjusting to the change at Bonnies'  no longer being played with. This causes Woody to fight for a purpose and the experiences he once had with Andy.  Woody realizes  Forky is Bonnie's favorite toy and tries to get him to adjust and appreciate being a toy.  When Forky tries to escape on the road trip, Woody goes after him in attempt to keep Bonnie happy. Woody tells Forky he should feel lucky to be the favorite toy, and Forky finally understands when he is told he's Bonnies \"trash\" and that he is warm and safe to her. I love how he makes this connection. Woody and Forky then head down the road as Woody explains life as a toy and tells stories about Andy.  \n\n \n\nI love how the idea of self-conscious is introduced by Woody when he explains to Buzz what an 'inner voice\" is. Buzz then literally uses his automated voice to help guide him to make decisions. Woody wanders into an antique shop in hopes to locate a long lost friend and meets an old doll named Gabby Gabby who's missing her voice box. Gabby and her  gang of ventriloquist dolls are determined to retrieve one and targets Woody for the job. Woody ultimately gives up his voice box to save Forky and grants Gabby the satisfaction and experience he once had having his own kid. Gabby wasn't chosen by the kid she had been expecting, but was unexpectedly placed with a kid who was meant for her. Woody crosses paths with Bo and is faced with life as he knows it as a toy with a child, or being a lost toy with his dear friend. When Woody gets Forky back to the RV he is torn with leaving Bo behind. Buzz says \"She'll be okay, I mean Bonnie.\" and helps remind Woody to  listen to his inner voice.  \n\n \n\nI recommend this movie, it has a great meaning and story line that both kids and adults can relate to. Toy story 4 teaches kids to use their self-conscious as a moral compass and guidance. It also showed sacrifice by Woody going after Forky and giving up his voice box to give another toy a chance. Another lesson shown in this film was reason for living or purpose. Woody struggled with adjusting and feeling fulfilled as a toy .Bo helped him explore a different side a broaden his horizons to something new.  \n\n Woody needed more in life and needed to move on from the past. Leaving the toys to go with Bo was a decisions that would give him purpose and make him happier.",

The movie was pretty amusing I'd give it a 4 out of five stars but it wasn't as nostalgic as any of the other movies. It fit in with the series pretty well but it just didn't make the same waves as the other movies in my eyes. \n\nThe feeling of seeing the toys again gives you nostalgia especially with the events of toy story 3. It really makes you kind of happy just seeing that the toys are still there and being played with. With the introduction of new characters it also brings in suspense along with humor and it had you thinking what was going to happen frequently.   \n\nThe movie made huge references to the previous movies.  I really liked the nostalgic feel the movie gave you. They didn't spend too much effort in all scenes you could tell the work was equal in every scene. I liked the movie, I would most definitely suggest it to others to watch with children or by themselves. \n\nToy story 4 is out and it did really good numbers. Children loved it, adults loved it, and there is  an abundance of reviews online cherishing it. So I most definitely would recommend checking in to it if your into those kind of things that I've listed.",

I am, frankly, beyond disappointed. Not only did they completely get Woody wrong, but, they turned Buzz into a complete buffoon who had most of the movies events (With him in them) occurring to him by happenstance. Then, the movie just proves Woody's argument that \"We do this for the kids\" wrong. What's worse, is it seems as if every established character (specifically the males I.E. Buzz and Woody) somehow became pushovers with no leadership skills whatsoever. They couldn't do any right and the only one's that did were female. Look, full disclosure, I grew up in an all female household. I think women should reach for the frickin stars. However, leaving the impression they should do so by making men seem less than them in the process is something that not only is wrong, but hypocritical. Just pretty sad, even if I am in the minority that think so.",

The complaints I do have are minor, mainly dealing with plot points that I felt were a bit rushed or clunky at times, yet overall this film is definitely a feel good family movie, and one that does its job at wrapping up the series.

Especially a movie that comes after an already excellent conclusion -and my favourite Toy Story instalment- Toy Story 3.\n\nMore objectionable, the majority of characters annoyed me. Not all the time, but often. Bonnie is a realistic portrayal of a child; an ungrateful, whiny being that'll throw anything it cherished the day before to the side like trash. For literal trash. And then yell murder when that piece of trash goes missing. Every forking time. \"Real\" children are something I don't enjoy seeing in fiction. Why not use the fact it's fiction to write a less douchy child? Her treatment of Woody spits on the ending of Toy Story 3, but I guess this sequel needs to hammer it in our heads that Woody is obsolete, otherwise him leaving at the end would raise eyebrows. I found Sporky unbearable in the first half as well, and his existence is a missed opportunity to answer the question: how come he's alive? Bo Peep was sort of cool, but mostly came across as a bitch. I felt no chemistry between her and Woody. The carnival plushies were funny, but overstayed their welcome at times. As for the rest of Andy's old toys, they were hardly in the movie. I would've liked to see more Buzz Lightyear, at the very least. Also, maybe I remember it wrong because it's been forever, but.. didn't Buzz and that cowboy girl develop a crush on each other in the previous movie? I can't even recall them interacting in Toy Story 4. Anyway, long story less long, it was uninteresting, mostly unpleasant, would not watch again. And those antique store dummies were aids.",

Woody (as well as Bo Peep in her own experience ever since her departure) felt unused in his new lifestyle with Bonnie and there are plenty of other toys that hardly ever got the approximate playtime that he did throughout his years with Andy and meeting with Bonnie, and when he decided to help other toys who never had that chance, it felt like the greatest gift one (toy) can give to another (toy). What's interesting is that Woody also did that in the ending of Toy Story 3, where instead of having his friends sent off into the attic for their possible eternity, he sent them off, including himself, to a fun new life (aka a second chance) with Bonnie. The point is, the whole story really clicks and makes a lot of sense. If you haven't seen this film, do yourself a carnival-sized favor and watch this movie! It is not trash (pun intended).\n\nPS: You might want to stick around in the mid-credits. If you have a sense of humor, Ducky and Bunny have you covered once again!",

Bo Peep, excised from the last films, comes back with aplomb, a perfect foil for Woody and his arc, a brilliant character, and Woody has a brilliant arc in this film, a film dealing with the next steps of parenthood, after saying goodbye in 3, it's now about finding new purpose in later life. Not very often it's very funny, but it's quality over quantity, inbetween the laughs is a family drama with characters we've been living with for some time, it's like hugging a distant cousin that you forget you love so much until you see them again.",

NO. she did not have the authority to play my guy woody like that. he may have \"loved\" her but i know damn well as soon as another good looking cowboy toy comes along she's gone. i REALLY feel bad for woody. he is BLINDED by false hope. he needed to stay with his friends who have his back but he chose to follow a fake ass bitch and ruin his god damn life. this movie deadass ruined my childhood. i LOVE toy story and all the characters from toy story 1 and 4 all the way up until woody left buzz. and obviously buzz cares too much about woodys happiness to say anything about how he feels because buzz is a GREAT guy!!! he is SO selfless and is now my favorite toy story character is buzz now and FOREVER. to sum up this very passionate review, woody is a fucking dumbass and ruined the whole dynamic of this BEAUTIFUL series.",

All because he doesn't get played with that much anymore??? I get it Bonnie isn't Andy but that doesn't mean you leave your family . Why didn't they make it where they all stay together. I threw the DVD away, my son wouldn't even watch it. It was AWFUL. It doesn't even go with the first 3 Tot Storys. \n\n\n10/10 don't recommend.

My only real issues with Toy Story 4 are that it could have been funnier, a lot of the other characters are sidelined for Woody and Bo's story, and how it's ultimately kind of unnecessary.  But even these issues I can kind of justify.  It's more about the emotions than the comedy, the story really is Woody's story, and despite being unnecessary it does take the Toy Story story into a new direction.  It visits a lot of familiar territory, but does so in some new ways.  The villain for example does not have your standard Toy Story villain ending, and without diving too deep into spoilers it's kind of a tearjerker.  And yes the whole thing is a tearjerker.  The return of Bo Peep I found an interesting choice, but she wasn't the most dynamic character in the first two films.  Here, they expand on her a lot while still keeping the essence of her character, and she becomes on of the most interesting characters in this whole franchise through her arc.  And yeah that ending, it broke me, honestly I was holding it together fine but there is a line from Buzz that comes at the end that if you're not crying yet, you will.  Toy Story 4 doesn't quite feel as polished as some other Pixar films, but it's still an incredibly solid film with characters we love and some new ones that are a lot of fun.  I haven't even talked about Forky, he's a spectacular new entry.  It's not a part of the story I wanted, but now that it's here I'm glad I got it.  It's got all the heart and beauty and enough of the comedy to be a worthy entry in this franchise.",

Buzz Lightyear is practically a minor character since his role lacks significance  to the plot tremendously if you compare it to the previous \"toy story's\" and they also make his personality appear dimwitted pretty often which just simply looks not right if you've watched 1 ,2 and 3. Even less importance are Jessie, Bullseye, Slinky,Potato Heads, Rex etc .. shaved a half star for that. Still excellent but it ranks the lowest in the saga to me.  I understand if you don't like the bittersweet ending. Some say the 3rd is how it should have ended which ends on a more positive note. Still i give it 9/10.",

            "content": "It was disappointing and worst of all forgettable. The plot felt very unpolished compared to Pixar's previous ventures with this franchise and it focused on introducing too many new characters that we had barely any screen time with any of the characters we actually care about. Woody didn't even really feel like Woody in this entry almost like Hanks had stopped caring about the role and/or was given a kind of lousy script. One of the most heartbreaking parts of this entry is that the relationships we really developed in the first two entries were forgotten about. Buzz and Woody had one scene of development together, that's it. I also feel like Buzz got the short end of the stick as far as I feel like they could have written him out of the script and nothing would have been lost as far as the plot is concerned. Jessie (never been my favorite character) also got maybe 2-3 minutes of actual screen time and a sentence or two of script. I can't even remember Bullseye being in the movie. Bonnie's new toys didn't get enough time to actually have much of a personality, the Key and Peele toys weren't that funny (suprisingly) and just cheapened the overall experience. Bo Peep was an annoying character for me. I am all for equality between genders but this just seems so tacked on and politically charged and irked me just like Belle in the live action's Beauty and the Beast or those Frozen girls. She was annoying to watch and had the same personality as every other Disney princess since Disney \"woke.\" The movie's only antagonist's story arch resolved with 20 minutes to go and she was utterly forgettable. Her dummy henchmen are going to be giving my boys nightmares for the rest of their lives and were definitely not something I expected to see in a family movie (and I'm not one to shelter my children from potentially scary scenes, looking at you shark attack in Finding Nemo). I'm surprised how high this has been rated and just don't see it. For me it ranks right around Monster's University on the Pixar lineup with Cars 2 (never saw 3) being one of the few below it. I even liked Finding Dory significantly more than this one and that was the movie that made me realize that Pixar has lost it's magic. If it weren't for Inside Out I probably wouldn't bother seeing any more of Pixar (or Disney for that matter) until they make some big changes.",

I grew up on the original 3 movies and although I adore this film and it is probably the 2nd best to date (after the 2nd of course). However, I can't help but ask them not to make another. I feel that if the studio pushes for another simply because they do well it will make the films loose their unique magic. I do appriciate the gap between the 3rd and 4th, but I hope it is atleast another 5 years if number 5 comes out. Please don't let it loose the magic that made all 4 films so special to me and others.",

The third film is loved by virtually everyone and the fourth film overrides the ending of the last movie. So, why is Toy Story 4 much better than it should've been? Well, before we get to that, let's discuss the obvious problems: Bonnie and the lack of development of old characters. The former has been the butt of jokes on the Internet thanks to her visible neglect of Woody. While this does cheapen the impact of the ending of the last movie, she's still only a 5-year-old girl and neglecting that one toy is normal behaviour for children her age. So calm down, guys. And with regards as to why the toys spend most of the movie literally and metaphorically in the back seat, I think the shorts and TV specials did help the characters go through arcs. That is, if those are even canon anyway. And they weren't completely useless nor were they interchangeable. Now that I've played the devil's advocate to the two things people have complained about, let's get down to talking about why this movie is good. The animation (uh-doy!). At times, you'd swear Pixar was just showing off, especially compared to how outdated the '90s movies look (mostly the first film, but the second film has its more awkward moments despite having much better human designs and outside scenes). And the script still has its share of emotional and comedic moments, helped by the voice acting. And I do like the new characters and am glad to see how Woody has come a long way from being the guy who'd resort to pushing Buzz under a table, out of Andy's line of sight, just so that he can get to go to Pizza Planet. I do find the ending a worthy end to Woody's story, especially considering the override. Still less esoteric than the one from Wreck-it Ralph 2, if you ask me. I enjoyed Toy Story 4 and consider it a worthy, and presumable ACTUAL, conclusion to not just the series but Pixar's \"sequel phase\" given that they have no sequels planned for the next decade...at the time I'm writing this review anyway. I just hope that they'll be able to handle the responsibility of making 2 original movies in 2020 without John Lasseter. Though Soul does have Pete Docter directing it, so I wouldn't be too concerned. Only time will tell if they'll gain \"Inside Out\" levels of acclaim.",

The animation is the best in Pixar's relatively short history and the writing is almost as good. For some reason they left buzz on the back burner. Woody once again is sent through a life changing struggle that ultimately ends in a way I felt Toy Story 3 could have gone.

            "content": "At this point everyone knows what Pixar is\u2026 THE ANIMATION GOAT. They have been just putting out banger after banger for years and they do not seem to be stopping any time soon.\n\nToy Story however has always been their most prized franchise. It is the film that started it all, and it is easily the most popular franchise of any that Pixar has put out. To be honest 3 is so perfect and heartwarming that it felt like the perfect end of the franchise. When people heard this was happening, and saw the first trailer, there was many reservations heading into this.\n\nNever in doubt though Pixar still brings the heat, especially with the Toys. This story is about how the toys new owner Bonnie makes a new friend Forky, and he decides to get lost in the forest. Woody goes after him because he is just so noble, and winds up on the adventure of a lifetime. Any more and I would kinda be spoiling so lets just get to the grades and we will finalize another fantastic entrant to the Pixar canon.\n\nAnimation \u2013 A It is Pixar and they always do it right. There were some legitimately incredible shots that could have been in live action movies, particularly one where Woody and Forky are walking down a highway. They also managed to make a spork look normal and fit into the universe which is an achievement in itself.\n\nVoice Cast \u2013 A+ All the big dogs are back, Hanks, Allen, Cusack, Ratzenberger, and all the old pals. However, we get four all time performances from new characters: Key and Peele as two bears that kids try to win at the carnival, Ally Maki as a toy cop, and Keanu Reeves (in the midst of a Keanuassaince) dominating the screen as a toy daredevil. It really does not get better than this as far as voices.\n\nMusic \u2013 B The score was typically very good, and they brought back You've Got a Friend in Me, but nothing really too crazy to put this over the edge for me.\n\nStory \u2013 A This is where the worry came in for the Pixar heads, because the first three were so satisfying we did not want them ruined. This felt very natural though and did not have to retread anything from the past. It gave us a true ending to Woody's journey and at the end of the day this was always his story. I loved how they brought back Bo Peep, and the arc of the villain Gabby Gabby as well. As always Pixar comes through when they need to.\n\n*A couple other tidbits\n\n- Bonnie kind of stinks compared to Andy, There I said it.\n\n- Jeff Garlin had like two amazing moments in this as well which always puts a smile on my face.\n\nWe may have been a tad worried going in, but as always Pixar knocked this one out of the park. Another incredible story about the Toys and another notch in their unrivaled filmography.\n\nJuice Rating:\n96/100",

We find our selves, once again following woody on an adventure, that spirals in to a chaotic turn of events. As we have come to expect from the franchise.

This isn't a \"Andy\" film, this one is focusing on Bonnie growing up with the toys and also showing us that Woody needs to move on from being Andy's favourite toy. Yes this film moves away from focusing on the main set of toys to focus on the brand new set of characters, but that's where the humour comes from and this is definitely the funniest toy story movie and its down to the new characters, the main stand out is Forky, the chemistry with him and Woody is 2 stand out performances inside this film. The main villain, Gabby Gabby is probably the most complex villain in the franchise, but I don't think she is the greatest villain, but still great to watch. Bringing back Bo Peep into the fold really helps to bring Woody's arc to a wonderful and emotional ending. However I do not think this is the most emotional toy story film as that belongs to toy story 3, but it's still emotional to see what happens at the end of the film, especially the final words that Woody and Buzz share together. That door has closed, or has it?????  \nWhat a way to end the most perfect animated franchise, and one of the most perfect (if not the perfect) film franchise ever made..... ",

Toy Story 4 manages to retain the charm and whimsy of the earlier films and isn't a total soulless cash-grab. I actually liked the themes it explored as well as the new characters - Forky's existential crises and Key/Peele's arguing were both quite enjoyable.

I feel all the other characters were lacking their normal traits. Even Buzz didn't act like his normal self or even his space ranger self. Barely any of the old characters featured in this film which is what I feel was lacking a lot. It was Bo, Andy and the new characters, that's it.\n\n2 and a half stars from me.

Unfortunately I still haven't quite been swayed by the latest feminist agenda popping up in movies and TV in recent years. Toy Story 4 tried hard and there was plenty of good moments and narrative absent of any agenda that made the film enjoyable. But the feminist moments just left a bad taste in my mouth. Woody is demeaned to the point of an \"accessory\" by Bo Peep, and yet we're expected to believe that Woody would love Bo Peep and just leave all his old friends behind who he's been with for all the three previous movies. It almost encourages masochism and low self esteem. It just feels spiteful and wrong. And then the passing of the sheriff's badge from Woody to Jessie just felt like a nod to the passing of the patriarchy to the matriarchy, which, again, if I were a feminist I'd have loved that moment. But to me it feels forced and politically motivated and I prefer art to be honest and reflect reality, rather than try to force fit an agenda onto a narrative in the hopes of recreating reality. It basically turns art into propaganda. But besides those moments, the rest of the movie was pretty good. ",

Key and Peel were a great addition to the cast, along with Keanu Reeves. It was a wild ride that had highs and lows of laughter, sorrow and just a little creeped out at time (I'm looking at you dummy's!) that just fits.

It's a very lazy, very unnecessary movie given the greatness of \u2018Toy Story 3' and its finale. The humor is fine, but rare, and its action/adventure elements are overwhelming and very uninteresting. And I love Pixar to death, but this particular franchise is the most overrated thing they've ever produced, and this film specifically is their worst after \u2018Cars 2'.

While on a road trip with her parents Bonnie losses her new favorite toy that she made in preschool and Woody attempts to get him back, and along the way he reunites with Bo Peep, who's joined a traveling carnival.  Most of the original cast returns along with several new additions, including Christina Hendricks, Tony Hale, and Keanu Reeves.  Once again the series takes on some very poignant themes, but it isn't quite as nuanced as in previous films and comes off as kind of talky and heavy handed.  The lack of a strong villain is also problematic.  However, the comedy is incredibly well-done and delivers a lot of laughs.  But it also has a lot of heart.  Though it's not as strong as some of the other entries in the franchise, Toy Story 4 is a fun and heartwarming family film.",

While on the road Woody runs into Bo Peep who's now adjusted to life as a lost toy.\n\nYeah I'll just.... come out with it here, I didn't like this movie. And aside from Cars this would be the worst Pixar movie I've seen so far.\n\nI'm a massive Toy Story and Pixar fan since 1995. Toy Story changed how I thought, it's THAT kind of movie for me. And I'd be here all day talking about what I love about Toy Story 1, 2 and I'd be here for a week talking about what I love about Toy Story 3 which is a true masterpiece.\n\nToy Story 3 was a PERRRRRFECT ending to the story of Woody and Buzz. They faced death together.... and survived. You can't top that for an adventure.... and they sure don't in Toy Story 4.\n\nIt's not a bad movie just... it didn't do much for me.\n\nI'll tell you one thing that bugged me when it was over was I could count on one hand the number of times I laughed. Where the hell were the jokes in this movie? That bit where the bunny and the chick hatch their plan... get it... but where they go over how they're gonna steal the antique shop owner's key... is one of the funniest gags in ANY Pixar movie. That was the first laugh for me and it was maybe 50 minutes into the movie. That's not the kind of joke/laugh ratio I like.\n\nForky... lemme talk about Forky....... Forky sucks ass.\n\nWhen I saw that character in the trailer I had a feeling that character would be annoying. And he's not annoying it's just... they don't do ANYTHING interesting with him at all. This idea of NEW LIFE and they don't do anything cool with it. It's Frankenstein's monster! The number of directions you can do with the creation of a toy and how they begin life seems infinite and... it felt like they threw all of that away. What a letdown. And they spend the first 20 minutes of the movie with his character, too which sucks.\n\nIt's a decent story, in these movies they've managed to do a great job giving us these takes on life for toys. For some toys it's about being owned and loved by a kid and the idea of being lost or abandoned is a hell without end....... unless you're Bo evidently.\n\nBo is a whole new and great character, living this almost Mad Max in the wasteland existence driving around in a skunk car.... long story that's never explained. And I don't wanna give away where the story goes but they make that an option for some of our characters and it's an interesting place to take the story..... but I've seen WAY more interesting stuff happen in these movies.\n\nI think the biggest problem this movie has is Toy Story 3.\n\nToy Story 3 had everything, a great and HARROWING story, laugh out loud moments every other minute, fantastic new characters, a STELLAR villain in Lotso Huggin' Bear and a climax I don't think Pixar will ever top, frankly.\n\nNot to mention the best opening scene in a Pixar movie with this sort of fantasy that I read as what literally happens for toys when they're played with, they're transported to this other reality where anything is possible. It made Woody's desire to be with Andy make even MORE sense. Who wouldn't want to be a part of adventures like that.\n\nSo I was pretty bummed when Toy Story 4 by the time it was over had nothing in common in Toy Story 3. There IS no villain, no Sid, no Stinky Pete, no Lotso, no life or death stakes.... and wow is that a nice way to make me care less about what happens in an adventure story.\n\nAnd the ending was.... so underwhelming to me. Like infuriatingly underwhelming.\n\nAfter the pitch perfect The End closure in Toy Story 3, they give us a NEW ending that was so left field and lame to me and sent me out of the theater with a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nAnd also as a fan of these movies I was crushed that the characters I grew to love like Jessie, Bullseye, Hamm, Potato Head, Rex... aside from Woody, Buzz and Bo the characters I knew were relegated to almost cameos in their own movie. It's like watching an X-Men movie and the only characters that get scenes are Wolverine, Xavier and Jean Grey..... don't gimme all these new characters when we're not done with the old ones yet!\n\nIt's not the kind of sequel I hate where it makes the other films worse but based on its own merits... aside from Woody and Bo's story and the quality of the animation this movie did nothing for me.\n\nNever mind the Toy Story movies, after incredible works of art like Inside Out and Coco coming out of Pixar this movie just seemed cookie cutter to me.\n\nToy Story 4 is a HUUUUUUGE letdown for me.",

            "content": "When I first heard they were making a Toy Story 4, I didn't think it was necessary at all. Toy Story 3 ended the story perfectly, what more could be done with it? Not to mention that it's a Pixar sequel made in the 2010s, which don't exactly have a great reputation. Toy Story 3 was great, Cars 2 was bad, Monsters University was okay, Finding Dory was good but forgettable (no pun intended), Cars 3 was okay and Incredibles 2 was a lot of fun but not as memorable as the first movie. It didn't help that none of the Toy Story 4 trailers impressed me. I walked into this movie cautiously optimistic. I hoped it would be at least as good as Incredibles 2 but I was ready for the possibility of a disappointment. However, after seeing the movie, I can confidently say that they did it again. They made another great Toy Story movie. It has an engaging and emotional story, a lovable and memorable cast of characters, interesting themes and ideas, the most beautiful animation that Pixar has put to screen yet, pitch-perfect voice acting, and really great action and comedy! While Toy Story 3 was the perfect ending, I think Toy Story 4 is a great epilogue. This is probably where the story would go next, whether you like it or not. I do have some criticisms though. Some of the writing and comedic timing felt surprisingly clunky and off a couple of times and the ending does feel a little rushed. The ending of Toy Story 3 was definitely a better finale to the series as a whole, it was more epic and larger in scale, but this is more of a finale to the arcs of the main characters. I can't think of a more fitting way to end both this story and the 2010s decade of Pixar movies. It came in with a Toy Story movie and it went out with a Toy Story movie, and it looks like this is the last Pixar sequel we're going to see for a long time. It's been confirmed that there are no sequels coming out for the foreseeable future and they will be putting their focus on original films only. That sounds good to me! Overall, this is a must-see for any fan of the Toy Story movies. It just might be another instant classic. Highly recommended.",

Buzz has a pretty idiotic side plot, Jessie and Andy's original toys are almost never on screen, and Woody and Bo just didn't build it up enough. I kept sitting in the theater and waiting to feel like I was experiencing this film, waiting for Pixar to hit me in the heart, and it didn't happen. Towards the end there was a part where I think I was supposed to cry and I just didn't. It wasn't built up enough. The third one was much better. This is the weakest one in the franchise.

Packed with plenty of colourful characters, hilarious laughs and terrific performances from an A-list cast, the film delivers everything that fans could have hoped for. At a first glance, extending the series may have seemed like an impossible feat. However, director Josh Cooley has pulled it off seamlessly. Not only does \"Toy Story 4\" bring back the beloved toys we've grown to adore, but it also introduces fresh faces into the cast. Forky, for instance, is the funniest character and a standout in the new additions to the cast. Although \"Toy Story 4\" offers fun family entertainment, it is not a film without flaws. At times, it feels slightly rushed and doesn't give all the characters a chance to shine. Due to its rushed pacing, it isn't quite on par with its predecessors in terms of quality. Nevertheless, fans of the franchise will definitely enjoy \"Toy Story 4\" and so will movie-goers seeking family-friendly entertainment this summer season. If this truly is the last time we see Woody and his friends on the big-screen, its a fitting farewell to the toys we've grown to love and adore.",

However after seeing Toy Story 4 I have to say I am very impressed and surprised. I really liked this film. It is definitely the weakest of the Quadrilogy for me, however that doesn't say all that much as all the movies are so good. Pixar have done it again. They have put in so much care, effort and time into this. It's been 9 years since the 3rd film so there was a lot of expectation. This is a funny, moving, charming film which is a great extension of Toy Story 3's ending assuming this is the last one. The ending is satisfying, it's not super dark and intense like the incinerator from part 3 but it leaves you feeling warm. The new characters are all awesome, especially Gabby Gabby. Her character arc was very emotional, we think at first she is the antagonist however that is since revealed not to be true. I also think Duke Caboom, Ducky and Bunny are all hilarious.This is also a greta ending for Woody and I feel like Woody's character has really come full circle and has matured. Its great seeing Bo back and rekindling her relationship with Woody and seeing how her character has changed. The music is classic Toy Story and it works. It moves at a great pace. Its a wonderfully surprising return to these characters but the only criticism I have is that a lot of the original characters don't get a lot to do, which is a slight shame but other than that, well done Pixar! :) This movie was unnecessary but I am glad you made it. But now is a good place to stop. The Toy Story films have been consistently fantastic and the 4 movies work and I really feel this film is the official ending of the Toy Story saga and it should stay that way. I would score this film a 9/10",

There are some really interesting parts to it \u2013 the Forky the spork, for example, who doesn't want to be a toy and has a \"death drive\" of throwing himself into the trash; and conversely, the doll Gabby, who feels she can only be a complete toy with a working voicebox, and is willing to hurt others (in particular, Woody) to acquire one.  Toy Story 4 probably features the least interaction with humans, and specifically families, of the entire series, a gap which is partly filled by Woody, who tries to parent Forky, and Bo Peep, who looks after her sheep and other \"independent\" toys.  And in the end, both choose a life together, away from humans, after helping Gabby find a girl for her.  Is this what it looks like when toys grow up themselves, or is it more like retirement?   While neither kiddo is especially into dolls or action figures, this series still retains its charm for them, I think because it captures the mystery of childhood play.  And that can sometimes be violent and unjust, as demonstrated by this film. ",

The lighting and shadows darting across Bo-Peep's facial features are a level of detail that can easily be taken for granted and it is fun to watch just to appreciate the spectacle and feat of CGI. \n\nThat said, though, it was a little questionable at first as to whether this film was needed. Nobody was really asking for Toy Story number 4 . When the news was announced that Disney and Pixar were doing it I remember wondering why, what story was left to tell? We had concluded the tale, Toy Story 3 was a beautiful end to an animated saga that had carried a generation through childhood into adolescence, and now they were creating a fourth? Could we, as an audience that had departed this train and exited the platform be bothered to get back on board? I mean, where was it even headed? We all know how this goes, Disney did it with Pirates of the Caribbean, a new trilogy of films that can't live up to the originals and succeed only in tainting the franchise.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised though to find myself exiting the cinema, having watched the most recent installment, with a sense of closure that I didn't even realise I needed.\n\nI mean think about it this way. The end of Toy Story 3 left Woody nodding a solemn farewell to Andy, about to jump into a new life with Bonnie, the adorable and excitable kindergartener who could help these toys continue fulfilling their purpose as children's playthings. It was a bittersweet end, we connected with Andy as he clung on desperately to the remnants of childhood, but were happy to see another child find joy in playing with the characters that we'd grown to love through 3 incredible movies. \n\nBut nobody was asking, yet probably should have been, what happens in 6 or 7 years time when Bonnie is too old to play with these toys? Are we going to have to pick up the story again and watch them all find a new home? And what about Bo-Peep? Where the heck is she? And what even defines a toy? Why are other seemingly inanimate objects in this franchise not sentient, and what happens if something that was not previously labelled a toy is suddenly redefined as one by a child playing with it?  \n\nToy Story 4, often horrifyingly, addresses all of these unanswered questions, and delivers a hilarious, emotional punch that nobody knew they needed. We are introduced to Forky, an agonised creation made from trash that suffers an existential crisis of identity whilst being, literally, talked down from the ledge by Woody. Somehow Disney turn this into a storyline that lasts 100 minutes, and though it felt more like the tying of several ends that I wasn't aware were even loose until they were picked up in this movie, it was nonetheless enjoyable to watch and entertaining throughout. Let us not forget, this is a kids film, and the giggles and laughter echoing through the screening are testament to the fact that this delivers to it's target audience. \n\nWill Toy Story 5 happen? Knowing Disney - yes. Should it? Probably not.",

            "content": "The movie was great, although, I agree, it wasn't needed. Even though the last movie In the franchise wrapped things up perfectly, with Woody and the rest of Andy's toys now belonging to Bonnie, it was nice to see what happened to the toys after the last film. The movie opens up with a flashback to nine years ago, back at Andy's house, where Woody and Bo Peep are being separated as Bo Peep gets sent away due to Molly (Andy's sister) going to college. We then cut back to present day where Bonnie starts her first day at kindergarten and she creates a new toy out of a plastic spork and some crafting materials, which she names her new toy \"Forky\". Forky, who Bonnie takes home, does not believe he is a toy and insists he is \"trash\". It is then that Bonnie and her parents go on a road trip, and Bonnie brings along her toys, including \"Forky\". Forky, still believing he is trash, jumps out of a window and Woody goes to find him. Woody then finds Forky and convinces him he is a toy (or, at least, \"Bonnie's 'trash'\".) Woody and Forky then join back up with the rest of the toys, but not before stumbling upon an old antique store, which Woody thinks Bo Peep is inside. Woody, and, by extension, Forky, then go inside to try and find Bo Peep, but do not find her. Instead, they find a new character named \"Gabby Gabby\" who says she knows Bo Peep and offers to take them to her. It is then that \"Gabby Gabby\" plans to take Woody's \"voice box\" as hers is defective. Woody then bolts out of there, but not before Forky is captured. Woody then wants to head back in and save Forky, knowing that Bonnie needs him, but ends up finding Bo Peep, who is roaming on her own. Woody then tells Bo Peep that he needs to get Forky back from the antique store, where he's being held captive there, but Bo initially refuses, saying she used to be there but was tired of \"sitting on a shelf\", not being bought by someone. They, eventually, end up going to save him. We then cut back to the other toys, who are in the RV, and Buzz is getting worried about Woody for being gone too long. He ends up trying to find him, but gets mistaken for a carnival toy. He tries to break free, but not before meeting two more stuffed carnival toys, being \"Bunny\" and \"Ducky\", who hate him for taking \"top prize\" at the carnival game. He then breaks free and sets off to find Woody, with \"Bunny\" and \"Ducky\" following behind, as they aren't done giving him \"a piece of their mind\". Buzz eventually finds Woody, and, by extension, Bo Peep, with \"Bunny\" and \"Ducky\" catching up to Buzz and beating him up. Woody then promises them he can take them to Bonnie to be played with (spoiler alert: he never does) and they get excited. The team then go out to find Forky, who they do eventually find, but not before Gabby Gabby tries to take Woody's \"voice box\". Woody, begrudgingly, lets her have it if it meant Forky would be set free, and she agrees. Gabby Gabby, with her \"voice box\" fixed, then tries to get a kid to take her home, but, ultimately, gets rejected. Woody then offers to take Gabby Gabby to Bonnie to be played with (which, again, he doesn't do.) Instead, Gabby Gabby sees a lost kid at the carnival and, knowing how she's a \"lost toy\", decides to cheer her up by being taken home by her. Woody then finally meets up with the rest of the toys, Bo Peep and Forky with him, but then decides to stay with Bo Peep as he wants to help other toys get played with. I really am not a fan of this ending. Yes, Woody found his \"true calling\", but he, not to mention \"Bo\" and the other new toys he met along the way, could have easily stayed with Bonnie to be played with, but, I guess \"Pixar\" just wanted another \"feel-good\" ending. Speaking of which, before the movie came out, I initially heard it was gonna be darker and more \"heart-wrenching\" than the last movie, so I went in to this movie expecting a \"tear-jerker\" similar to the \"incinerator\" scene from the last film, but I didn't get that. Yes, it was \"warm-and-fuzzy\", but it didn't \"move\" me. Maybe this is because I'm getting used to these kinds of movies. Overall, the film was good and I highly recommend you check it out.",

This movie is a little overated, with this i \u00b4m not saying that the movie is bad, i just say that toy story 4 has a 97/100 in rotten tomatoes, or has a 8.2/10 in imdb, the movie is good yeah but it's not good enough to have those qualifications, let's be,honest of the 4 movies this is the worst, the only that stands out from its predecessors is in the incredible animation, something thati like very much is that the movie takes risk and lets Woody leave once it have finished his purpose, and his ending is good, great ending, I hope that this one be the last movie, in conclusion toy story 4 is a good movie with a mature plot,but nothing outstanding.",

I also loved Jordan Peele and Keegan Michael-Key's characters, Bunny and Ducky, I also think they did a great job. Keanu Reeves was also an amazing addition to the franchise.

I did like it better than the third movie overall, but I felt it was an unnecessary addition to the franchise and destroys all the messages of the previous movies. \n(Spoilers ahead...)\nMy main issues were as follows:\nFirstly it makes no sense to me that Bonnie would play with every toy except Woody, especially after she seemed so interested in playing with him in the third movie. Secondly, the whole voice box thing rubbed me the wrong way how Gabbie Gabbie blackmailed him to get it and not only kept it bu the end of the movie but also got a happy ending... it just kinda felt very off to me. I think it wouldve been more powerful if shed found a kid without needing the voice box... sends a better message of not needing to fix yourself to find a friend. That goes against the message of the precious movies, especially the second where theyd always say Andy will love you no matter what and Woody dealt with his arm being ripped and Andy still wanting to play with him regardless. Lastly, the idea Woody would just leave the entire gang of toys for Bo seems a bit out of character. And goes against the main theme of the other three films. Overall, I did like the movie due to the sheer amazement I had watching Pixars animation quality progress and come such a long way, but story wise it felt more like a fanfiction than something true to what gave Toy Story its heart in the first place and so fell flat.",

Woody our ever present source of righteousness finds himself struggling to come to terms with no longer being the beloved favourite. Something's never change though, as Woody remains the kindest and loyalist toy you would ever want. He goes the extra mile to ensure that Bonnie doesn't get down in the dumps with her kindergarten blues. This leads to the introduction of our newest member, the surprising engaging \u2018Forky'. Several events follow until we end up riding that old movie trope, The Road Trip. \n\nSlow to get going, the story gets stuck in a loop. It's not till the end where you see the Toy Story you love begin to flourish and blossom, making you feel all those emotions this franchise has made you ever so familiar with. \nRepetition runs rife, woven into the fabric of the narrative. The repetition begins and ends with Forky, the newest member of our toy chest. Suffering from a crisis of identity and belonging Forky seeks refuge in the place he believes he belongs. Thankfully this source of personal irritation is lulled by a tender scene, ran by Woody.\n\nWhile it may start slow, the opening sequence is quintessential Pixar, a delightful recap (that I was more than grateful for), brimming with warmth and emotion, just lovely storytelling. Quickly catching you up on Bo Peep's initial exit, before her return as a kick-ass, wandering renegade, seeking a life of freedom, which opposes the standard Toy life. \n\nAs for the new characters, they're all good, and there's a few I would've liked to see more of - and had their backstory improved upon. Gabby is a refreshing antagonist for a film targeted towards kids. She operates in the grey area of \u2018villains', she is without a doubt an intimidating on-screen presence, but the lines are blurred between good and evil, which is pleasing to see. The other side characters are all good, standouts being Duke Caboom and Bunny and Ducky. Ultimately they're sacrificed as Woody takes centre stage. He dominates the screen time, gobbling it all up. \n\nI do feel I should acknowledge that this 4th tale of the toys hits on similar beats covered in the first three tales. There is a distinct similarity in how the plot and character actions are bent to progress the story. At times it may feel contrived, but that feeling will be over-run by sheer nostalgia and joy that will never leave these characters.\n\nIn Toy Story 3 we all felt like the story had ran its course, and finished perfectly, but we were wrong, Toy Story was finished, but Woody's Story still had legs in it yet, and I'm pleased to say that this 4th installment did a wonderful job of telling and closing his arc, that meant so much to so many.\n \nSimply it's Woody's Story not Toy Story.",

The animation is fantastic, and is almost photorealistic. However, the story felt lazy to me. The themes of the film contradict eachother. Bo Peep says that having no kid is great and that toys without a kid have a certain freedom. After giving woody a speech about this, Bo Peep helps the doll find a child, and claims that that is the better thing. So what is the theme? That a toy should be loyal to a child or that a toy should fuck their child over and be free? Very confusing. The new characters are either really stupid or not funny at all, and the old characters didnt get shit from pixar. They sat in the r.v. and tricked some grown ass men into thinking that the gps was broken. HOWEVER, the ending saved this movie from 2 stars. The ending was emotional due to great performances by Tim Allen and Tom Hanks. In conclusion, this is deffinately what would have happened after Toy Story 3, but it was not needed for the universe. It was basically a fairly well done cash grab.",

My only gripe with the film is the existence of it. while yes it is a good film, i don't think we really needed it. I felt that the Toy's story concluded at the end of 3. since there is talks to make a 5th installment, I think the plot should be while Woody and Bo are exploring the world, they come across Andy grown up (possibly with a wife, and or child) I feel like that would defiantly be a tear jerker for a lot of people.but    ",

It was a wonderful experience seeing Woody, Buzz, and company on the big screen together again, but it isn't the best out of the series. I was just 6 years old when the very first one came out and it got me hooked, so this movie definitely brought back a lot of childhood memories but I still keep the original close to my heart.\n\nThe newest homemade toy Forky makes for a great imaginative addition, a lost Bo Peep shines as she takes charge right into the spotlight and Duke Caboom voiced by Keanu Reeves cashes in on the continued Keanu sensation. The movie has some great flashbacks to Andy but it is all about Bonnie. It does a great job sharing similar themes as it's predecessors and it really doesn't hit you hard in the feels until the very end which was a nice way to put an END to the Toy Story we all loved.\n\nI give it 8/10.",

We get to see Andy again, there's that beautiful transition sequence that Pixar excel at to bring us up to present events and we're back with the gang pretty much where we left off.\n\nSo about half hour in I started to wonder about the old characters, the Potato heads seemed mute (I know Ron died but they said they had his dialogue covered, but 3 lines?) Even Rex was unusually quiet and unpanicked. However the new characters seamlessly replaced them and I wasn't left wondering anymore. I loved the introduction of the little cop and then the inevitable dark side in the form of the ventriloquist dummies and the creepy but pretty little talking doll. The stunt guy was a great addition and each of the new guys played a nice part in the overall story telling, not forgetting the 2 stuffed toys from the shooting range. The little alternate reality scenes with them were a genius idea and added yet another layer to the already bulging amount of depth to this film.\n\nThe animation was on another level and the realism, although held a bit in check I feel so as to not go full on photo realistic was really lovely and made the whole thing sit as a believable film a whole lot more. I loved the way that although there was this dark threat to the film that is was actually done in a really nice way and the threat was neutralised and weaved itself perfectly into the story and the antagonist became the climax of the film. Before I went in I was wondering when they were going to deliver the emotional punch in the guts and as per the previous film it was almost at the end. I thought I could avoid it, not be affected, or just brush it off somehow but damn, those guys did it again and had me crying in the cinema when the little lost girl picked Dolly up and hugged her. Crikey, these guys know how to deliver that so masterfully and pull all of the invested emotion into a simple scene, leaving you brimming with all sorts of feelings and the unstoppable moist eyes.\n\nSo yeah, we went full circle, we learned all about friendships all over again, we had Buzz on another tangent with his inner voice and overall many layers of adult themes crammed into a children's romp. But Pixar know their quarry, these guys are the masters and they can pick and choose the top talent in the world to come and work for them. I noticed the film was directed by an unfamiliar face but clearly the old guard had a huge influence on this movie. I loved it from start to finish, what a feast, what a way to go out, belly laughs, tears and I just can't wait to watch it over and over again like I do with all of Pixar's masterpieces. Simply fantastic!",

The groundbreaking original \"Toy Story\" explored the relationship between inanimate object and children, only to discover the former, in plural, that the toys are alive with accustomed feelings that fuels loyalty and the need to be played with. The sentimental resonance is expressed in different ways after each chapter, including the shorts, and the supposedly concluding chapter \"Toy Story 4\" justified the further continuation with the emotional meaningfulness still ever intact for a more solidifying finale.\n\nEver since being donated to Bonnie, Andy's former childhood toys are much happier from livelier playtime with the little girl. Woody's rebooted bond with a new kid is instant as he always believes that a toy is always there for the kid, which led him to witness Bonnie's newly-created, crafted toy Forky capturing her young imaginative eyes, but the self-proclaimed trash declared otherwise when refused to be played as a toy. As the family went on a road trip with Bonnie taking the whole gang, it is up to Woody to show Forky the important role he now plays and why he should embrace the new status, but gets soon sidetracked into reuniting with his long-lost friend Bo Peep whose life on the road made her more daring and provides a new insight that will open Woody's eyes.\n\nAfter how the predecessor ended in remarkable perfection, a continuation would be met with initial doubt. Besides the treated bonus shorts released over the years afterwards in delivering more into the beloved characters' new life, a feature would need to be the final thread to the thematic core. Albeit feeling the somewhat little muddling narrative that fourth chapters tend to pace with in comparison to the previous entries and following up the best, the writing team managed to form ideas and wholesomely delivered, as well in particularly further expressing the relationship between a child and a toy from building to [fully] losing one and a toy finding its purpose. After this film, it has pretty much covered everything over the subject across the span of four films.\n\nLike each film being a toy line's latest series, it welcomes new likable characters that fits into the already-existing assortment, adding additional energy to the original. Joining the gang is Forky with Tony Hale providing much comic relief to the toying definition as well searching for the purpose with uncertain acceptance. Then around Bo Peep's clan is Giggle McDimples vocally lend by Ally Miki, Duke Caboom being another reviving brick for Keanu Reeves' stardom, hanging duo Ducky and Bunny channeling \"Key & Peele\" antics nicely for predicted amusement, and collecting dust in an antique store is Christina Hendricks' Gabby Gabby with a sympathetic depth. The new characters and additional cast easily becomes part of the series' fun soulfulness that the original cast been building from their in-synced charismatic performances since the beginning, which is in another way of looking at their efforts is functioning the heart and resonating emotional value while providing clever humor.\n\nNow this film would have been rated at four stars for the series' new low considering some decisive turns that could have been better polished than being utterly nonsensical, even if they were sources for needed plot motivation in order to reach the destined point, but \"Toy Story 4\" again marks how much computer-generated animation has technologically evolved as seen in detailed glaring reflection and facial expressions being more stretched out. It fuels the emotional range by diegetic perspective, which is where the tears started being drawn near the end for an unexpected game-changing decision for one character's truly epic journey. Imperfectly heightened to only be ranked the second best, and furthermore not at the same level nor greatly praised as \"The Hidden World\" being this year's top contender for Best Animated Feature over this one, it is nonetheless a solid chapter under final narrative assumption with justified continuation and ever loving heart to be another Pixar masterpiece \u2013 in honor to their groundbreaking achievement that has reached infinity and beyond. (That probably sounded corny). (A)",

The main villain of the movie has a reason for the way that they are and despite their evil, woody helps them. I love that. It will hopefully teach people to look to infinity and beyond the surface....allowing you to get to know someone that is acting mean or like a bully. You never know what youll learn and how everyone has the power to help someone, who may just be acting out because theyre in pain.  \n\nBTW, stay for the credits!",

But again, it's not necessarily a BAD thing, because it did join the previous movie with it relatively seamlessly!

Just when you think the animation couldn\u2019t get any better, they go ahead and one-up themselves going further and further into the details of everything. This movie was definitely more centered around Woody and BoPeep (and Forky) than any others, which I was fine with, but did have me missing not seeing the other characters quite as much. There were a couple scenes toward the end that got me a little bit teary-eyed, but I still think nothing tops the end of Toy Story 3. That being said, I really enjoyed this movie and think it was a good addition to the series. They could\u2019ve called it quits after Toy Story 3 and I would\u2019ve been happy, but Pixar knows how to handle this series and these characters and  put together a great movie. Toy Story 3 is still my favorite of the series, but Toy Story 4 was really entertaining and addressed some newer themes that kept things feeling fresh and engaging.

The main issue with this movie was the fact there wasn't enough buzz, Jesse etc. These characters are so important so without them this movie feels like something big is missing.\n\nTLDR: Good but was missing some parts\n\nAlso this is basically an add on to 3 and I think they should've just added woodys ending into 3 because this doesn't feel needed in my opi",

The animation is the most beautiful I've ever seen both inside and outside of Pixar, it's emotionally deep and complex with funny moments, heartwarming moments, nostalgia, anger, and the bittersweet ending, and while Toy Story 3 was the perfect ending for the franchise, I consider Toy Story 4 to be the perfect ending for Woody. Seeing all these characters back on the big screen was a delight, and all the new characters are everything between hilarious and terrifying with a fantastic villain that from a film making viewpoint is better than Lotso. The only big issue I have with it is that many of the old characters are put to the side, and I can see lovers of Buzz being extremely disappointed in how the film handled him.

Then, it became downright creepy when (spoiler alert) the doll Gabby went psycho on Woody, having her mannequin \"goons\" on woody to basically harvest his organs (voice box) for her own selfish enterprise. Really, I don't know if other adults picked up on this even though I'm sure the kids didn't. I honestly could not decide if Gabby was supposed to be a villain in this plot, yet the story was told as though she were a sympathetic character. Maybe I'm overthinking this. I think for the kiddos, still a great flick. For the adults, maybe a good opportunity for a restroom break halfway through. ",

Toy Story was always about friendship and loyalty, not about love, yet they made it about love and abandoning everything Woody stood for, for a so called \"love\". Andy gave his favorite toy to Bonnie for her to forget him and mistreat him? Sorry, but no. The perfect ending happened and that is the Toy Story 3.",

I have grown up with all the Toy Story films and I don't think this one dissapoints. However, I did like the ending of Toy Story 3 more than this ending. If they would have ended the trilogy with 3 I would have been happy. The movie could seem a little unecessary, but it was a good final adventure with the gang. Overall it was a good movie and a decent way to end one of the best animated trilogies of all time.",

The writing, helmed by Andrew Stanton, is excellent and the actors - especially Hanks (who owns this one completely ) have never been better. I can't believe what I'm saying, but I love these 'cartoons'. They are better than regular movies. TS3 was my favourite film of its year of release and it will take a hell of a movie to better this. Please read all of the critic reviews and audience reviews if you like. I can't say which one is my favourite, but this is right up there with the best.\n\nA lot of hate for Disney these days, but just think....Marvel. Star Wars. Pixar. Lion King. Aladdin.

But Bo's strengths are many and threaten to overwhelm and displace Woody's desire. She's a fiercely independent feminist, having been \"on her own,\" beyond the security of a child's bedroom, for 7 years. She's an athlete and a warrior, using her hook as a both a weapon and climbing device. Bo and other independent toys travel around in a mechanical skunk. These \"Independent Toys,\" which exist somewhere between \"Lost Toys\" and \"Toys who have a Kid,\" are a new category for the franchise.\n\nDuke Caboom, Ducky and Bunny are solid and funny additions to the \"Toy Story\" crew, but on the whole the cast is too large and dispenses with too many familiar characters to achieve the kind of focus that shaped previous editions.\n\nThese caveats aside, \"Toy Story 4\" is almost as good as its predecessors - and that's saying something.",

This was clearly a movie all about woody and I gotta say I am happy for him for what he chose at the end but at the same time I'm upset that they split up the group. I'm also a bit upset that the majority of the older characters didn't get much screen time at all. This movie could easily be setting up new beginnings for a 5th iteration in the franchise. Only time will tell but I'm game to return to these characters again. ",

Its design and graphic animation is superb and stuns the other movies. Character development is great and the villain is one of the best structured villains i've seen to date. But Buzz is completely played of and shoe horned to the side quite abruptly and dumbed down for comic relief. It also hangs shy from a 5 star not only because of that but because it really does play with the 'is this necessary?' emotions of a sequel. It's a good add on yes. But i do venture to the side of it should ending with the beautiful Andy Saga ending. Great movie.\n",

As someone whose first ever film was the original story and someone who saw Toy Story 3 in cinemas just before I started university (watching Andy head off for college), I consider myself very much of the Toy Story generation. This film really feels like it's forgotten it's older fans and has moved on to a much younger audience, which is quite sad. It lacked the usual charm of a Pixar movie that sees jokes for both children and adults. Scenes are repetitive and cover a lot of the same information multiple times. \n\nThe toy cast list has almost been tripled and yet next to no time is spent with any character that isn't Woody or Bo. Even staple characters like Buzz and Jessie are very much sidelined. So many characters are introduced and given next to no screen time.\n\nIt's sad to see Toy Story end this way after, what I consider, a perfect ending to their third instalment.",
