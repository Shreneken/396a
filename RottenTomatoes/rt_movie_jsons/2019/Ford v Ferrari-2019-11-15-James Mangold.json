A memorable, heart-pounding musical score and boisterous sound effects coupled with frenetic editing, electrifying action sequences, and strikingly beautiful cinematography, the film, directed by James Mangold (\"Logan\") is a speedy rock concert of a true story. As if these were not enough of a rollicking joy to watch, the film's epicenter are the masterful performances and undeniable chemistry between Damon and Bale. Although slow paced at times, the film contains equal doses of intense racing scenes shot in gorgeous wide angles and complex ethical dilemmas and human strife reminiscent of the brilliant baseball movie \"Moneyball\".\nAt its core, \"Ford V Ferrari\" is about the relationships that give us meaning, the passions that feed us, and honest friendship.",

            "content": "The film takes place in one of the most legendary moments in the history of motorsport, namely in 1966, it is mainly about the 24 Hours of Le Mans in France. The film is really spectacular, the perfect actors for the right roles were chosen, especially Christian Bale for one of the two main protagonists Ken Miles, and Matt Damon for the other leading role Carroll Shelby, these two are in my opinion one of the best two actors there is. In my opinion, the cinematography is also perfect you can always see the cars from the perfect angles during the races, so the film was nominated for the Oscar for best motion picture of the year for a reason. The vehicle sounds in the film sound extremely realistic, this can also be seen in the fact that the film won the Oscar for best sound editing. The vehicles in the film look exactly like the vehicles that were driven in the race in 1966. The film has very entertaining and funny scenes and a surprising ending that few would have expected. It is not without reason that the film won the Oscar for Best Editing, the film is always exciting and already falls into the category of thriller for me. The characters have to deal with an inner conflict, which is immediately noticeable, Carroll Shelby can no longer race because of his heart and Ken Miles has financial problems. The rivalry between Ken Miles and Leo Beebe is very exciting and extremely entertaining. The film features extremely good and well-known actors such as Jon Bernthal, Josh Lucas, etc.",

There is no need to waste words on the details, the movie is simply fun and recommended for viewing. Wishing only that other films seen in competition for this year's Film Academy Awards are more like that.",

I found myself wishing (while I was watching it) there was a bit more footage of actual car racing in the first half of the film but I suppose thats me being a bit too lazy and hoping for 24/7 action. To be fair, the film does have some good character development and it is pretty insightful about the corporate story, even though it is a somewhat long film at just over two hours and twenty minutes long. I thought its a pretty solid film by the end - I found it quite immersive and gripping. If your a fan of motor racing or like a good biopic (especially a sports biopic) then this film is well worth seeing, yes.",

I really can't think of any other racing movie of the 2010s decade or the 21st century as a whole that was so much fun and as riveting as this one. Christian Bale is brilliant at playing the true character of Ken Miles and his unsung story which has been known by very little people until now of how Ford were able to construct the perfect racing machine to rival Ferrari's perfect winning streak on the 24 hour Le Mans circuit\n\nOne of the best things I like the most about the movie is that not just how the racing action is directed and how the vehicle is shown, but also how it feels. The audio of the engine in this movie is impeccable on just how much pressure and stress Miles is putting on the engine and throttle at any given time, and just how he is able to perfectly stress the engine and sustain it for maximum endurance and figuring out just the right moment to push it just a little bit further for maximum performance. I really loved that touch that this movie has and I hope future racing movies learn from it. I also love how Miles explains this in many scenes, especially in one where he explains it perfectly to his son (did I also mention that the writing is impeccable) \n\nMatt Damon as Carrol Shelby is also an amazing supporting character and Christian and Damon bounce off eachother very well and have an equal presence in the movie. Bale's acting is great as always. \n\nI also love the cinematography and look of the movie. The directing of the racing action is incredible. The film visually is dripping with soul and atmosphere of the racing period where you can almost smell the fuming petrol and hot dripping sweat of the drives on the blistering Le Mans day and the cold dripping rain in the following storm.\n\nOverall I think it's a perfect racing flick and it's going to take a long while for another one to tell as great as a story as this one did and also being this much fun to watch all the way through",

            "content": "Ford v Ferrari \u2013 The way Hollywood Scriptwriters Have Said More in 2.5 Hours than All Management Textbooks Contain\nAmerican version.\n   The history of the creation of the Ford GT40 is no different from thousands of similar histories that have happened in the past and are happening now. Unfortunately, nothing special. Wikipedia gives only 539 words of dry text about it. No dramaturgy. Then how can one produce a 2.5 hour movie based on such material? What it needs is...\n\"Man who comes to my office with an idea, that man keeps his job. Rest of you, second best losers, stay home. You don't belong in Ford.\"\n   While watching the movie, my brain gorged on serotonin and dopamine. Cars, races, fierce struggle - just like in The Fast and the Furious. However, Ford v Ferrari is not about that at all. And after watching, having eaten potent drugs, my brain began to signal an obvious discrepancy. Whom the main characters were supposed to defeat in the fierce struggle, follows even from the name\u2026\n    Stop! Now, who did Ken and Shelby fight throughout the movie? Italians from Ferrari? Or maybe unsolvable technical problems? Who constantly put spokes in their wheels? Through the mouth of Ken, the authors give a direct answer:\n\"And they're gonna work out new ways to screw you. Why? Because they can't help it. Because they just want to please their boss, he wants to please his boss who wants to please his boss. And they hate themselves for it. But deep down\u2026 Who they hate even more are guys like you, because you're not like them, because you don't think like them, because you're different.\"\n   Naturally, to complete the picture, the authors, through the mouth of Shelby, give a description of those \"different ones\": \n\"But there are a few people who find something they have to do. Something obsesses'em. Something that if they can't do it, it's gonna drive'em clean out of their mind. I'm that guy.\"\n   That's it \u2013 the Idea! Raise the intensity of the struggle, add spice to the 539 words of dry text. The on-screen Leo Beebe, with all his intrigues against Ken and Shelby, is a character entirely invented by the authors. The only thing associating him to the real Leo Beebe is the name. \n\nThe war of talents: a knife in the back or a wrench in the forehead\n    A well-known \"fan\" of Leo Beebe said: \"I felt in them what I called to myself \"sham good nature\", distrust and cruelty hidden under the guise of courtesy. Typical behavior of bureaucrats: they smile in your face, but they will not miss an opportunity to stab you in the back. And in the movie, we can see a knife sticking out of Ken's back. Twice.\n    The first blow was the DQ from the race. The second was the theft of victory. That would break anyone. Not Ken. After all, his goal is not a medal or the roar of an admiring crowd. He only needs one phrase from a tramp like himself (Shelby). One hat removed from a rival like himself (Enzo). Why, what he really needed was just another lap! But \"the perfect lap\" Ken had talked about to his son. He had nothing more to dream of. And no power could take it away\u2026\n    The wrench thrown by Ken at Shelby is also for a reason in the movie. A burst of rage? Tantrum? A quiet storm released? Yes! It's all about them, about the \"different ones\". They even fought each other!\n   Two types of talents are pursuing completely different goals, living on different planets. And they even fight in different ways: some calmly wield a carefully sharpened knife and attack according to a carefully developed scheme, as a rule, from behind. Others rush into a frontal attack with whatever comes to hand. \n   That's Ken Miles as he is, with all his unbroken, rebellious spirit of a warrior - in one rashly thrown wrench. That's why Shelby has kept that wrench.\n   And it was precisely what made Shelby stay restless after the death of Ken. For six months. Only by passing a particle of this Spirit to Ken's son, he found peace of mind \u2026\nAccess to the body. Information as a weapon\n    The episode of the visit of Henry Ford II to Shelby's is based on the funny \"kidnapping\" of the CEO. Thus, with humor, the authors have included in the plot a task from real corporate life, which is not mentioned in any management textbooks. Many of us tried to get \"access to the body\", but hardly anyone went as far as kidnapping the CEO. And all for the sake of fulfilling their direct duties.\n   The duty of any leader is to inform superiors and subordinates. But there is not a word in the textbooks of what can be done with information:\n\uf0fc\tblocking\n\uf0fc\tdosing\n\uf0fc\tembellishing\n\uf0fc\tdownplaying and exaggerating\n\uf0fc\tredirecting\n\uf0fc\tdistortig\n\uf0fc\tinventing and throwing in\n\uf0fc\tleveling\n\uf0fc\thiding behind something more important and loud\n\uf0fc\tholding and releasing at the wrong time\n\uf0fc\tdishing up in different forms\n\uf0fc\tharbor like a grudge\n\uf0fc\tetc. etc. etc.. \n   In general, information can and should be managed. But future managers are not taught this art in any way. \n   This lapse is aggravated by the fact that in real corporate life there are always talents who master it to perfection. There is a Leo Beebe in every organization in the world, but we \"don't know\" about it, because in management textbooks there is not a word about dividing people into types (see above). And not a word about the ongoing war between these types. \n   And no one warns that any leader, sooner or later, has to pick a side in this war. That is, sooner or later he will be forced to give an answer to one question. The question the authors of the film, through Shelby, ask at the very beginning: \"Who are you?\"\nComfort as a goal. Power and influence as a tool for implementation.\n   The fact that the authors have formulated Leo Beebe's goal is of fundamental importance. After all, only if the goals of management coincide with those of the company, one can talk of the success of the latter. And yes, it happens: people hired to achieve the company goals, often formulating these goals themselves, actually implement something completely different:\n\"There's gotta be a sense of give-and-take between you and\u2026 you know.\"\n\"No, I don't.\"\n\"The group.\"\n\"The group?\"\n\"Senior creative, Carroll. Just to make sure everybody's comfortable.\"\n\"Well, I'm confused, Lee. \u2018Cause up until this moment right now I was comfortable.\"\n   It turns out that Leo Beebe is not alone, he is just a member of a \"group\" (informal organization). The goal of the \"group\" and all its members is comfort, a comfortable stay in their chairs. Does anyone know of a company with a goal like that? But the \"group\" is not sitting idly by. It is taking all proper steps to achieve its goal. As in the above dialog.\n   Hence the informal links permeating the entire body of the company and reshaping its organizational structure. Hence the real distribution of power and influence in the company, breaking its formal hierarchy. Simple questions: who was really running the on-screen Ford Company? Who really possessed all the power and unlimited influence? Was it Henry Ford II or Leo Beebe with the \"group\"?\n    Just take another look at the way that always smiling, sweet, good-natured Leo Beebe holds Lee accountable:\n\"Have you talked to him?\"! \n   This phrase can be placed in another movie masterpiece - The Godfather. And no one will notice the fraud! How did it happen that the marketing director of the largest US corporation turned out to be an errand boy?! Why was Lee ordered to talk to Shelby? Why didn't Lee refuse? Didn't he frankly sympathize with Shelby and Ken throughout the film!\n   The answer is obvious: Lee was afraid that the next morning they would find his \"body with a knife sticking out of the back.\" Think it's my fantasy? An extrapolation of the filmmakers' fantasy? Think these \"fantasies\" are far from reality?\n    Let me remind you the evening of September 16, 1985. News agencies reported a terrible discovery: \"a body with a knife sticking out of the back\" was found near the Apple boardroom. It was Steve Jobs. Or have you forgotten the way the American Icon got kicked out of his own company? Forgotten the way someone stole twelve years from the infinitely short time allotted to Steve?!\n***\n   It's not just the film's double bottom that's amazing. It is amazing how much information the authors have managed to hide there! It is impossible to cover this scope in one review. However, I am sure that any competent business school teacher or consultant, having analyzed this film piece by piece (and it consists entirely of such pieces!), in a day or two will tell much more about real management in real corporate life than is written in all management textbooks! \nThe smugglers\n     Today, you can hardly surprise anyone with smuggling of all kinds of things. It's quite another pair of shoes with smuggling of thoughts. I mean those who are able to elegantly and imperceptibly put their thoughts right into your head, while talking about something completely different. Then, while putting things in order in your \"attic\" after some time, you suddenly discover someone's thought. It's like with a surprise hidden away by one of the departed guests. A box of chocolates or a postcard \u2013 just a trifle! Still, it makes your face break into a smile.\n    And I keep smiling each tie I remember the way I was caught with chaff the first time I watched it. You have failed to notice anything too? Take it easy! \n    Even the 10 000+  experienced people working in cinema  have failed to notice anything. The Oscars awarded for best film editing and sound editing is a confirmation. After all, these are the only things lying on the surface. And these are the only things the \"customs officers\" have seen and heard. Everything else, as befits real smuggling, has gone unnoticed. \u2026 \n   Perhaps someone would think I question the competence and impartiality of AMPAS. But suppose I just want to emphasize once again the talent of the smugglers. Well, that is for everyone to decide for himself...\nTouch of Eternity\nYoutube is flooded with videos where someone puts a girl into a charged car and hits the gas. We have all seen the natural reaction of the subjects. And the filmmakers couldn't help but know about it. And yet they took the risk! They took the risk to capture the touch of Eternity in such a \"hackneyed\" scene. \n    The little boy Henry Ford II had spent his whole life in the shadow cast by his father's giant Majesty tree. It isn't so easy, you see: to hear all your life that you are just an offspring of that same Ford, that you are the \"second\". And so, in his forty-eighth (!) year, he approached the edge of this giant shadow, and Eternity itself, taking him by the shoulder, whispered to him about it.\n    Now the virus of the Idea \"... What if the Ford badge becomes synonymous to victory?\", having passed through the bury-pasta-under-the-finish-line mutation, having come into contact with Eternity, has mutated into a clearly visible trace in history, with no shadow of the great father falling on it. \n\"I wish my daddy were alive to see this. To feel this!\" \n   Speed, power, an explosion of emotions richly seasoned with adrenaline. Painful mutations of the Idea virus. The realization that you have finally done something worthwhile, something worthy of a special mention in history. And the quiet whisper of Eternity, its light touch, crowning the many years of attempts to get out of the father's shadow. All this in one scene, in one episode. \n    These guys have captured the touch of Eternity! This guy - Tracy S. Letts has played the reaction of a person to this touch. Perhaps for the first time in the history of cinema. Isn't that what Oscars are given for? At least for the very Idea to shoot this?!\n      And after all, the on-screen Henry Ford II is damn right! The GT40 Shelby drove him in is the only(!) reason we still remember his name. \u2026\n\nBar of History\n   The Ford GT40 was first at Le Mans four times (1966-1969). This is the only victory for American automakers. That is why the GT40 has become a legend. And what happened next? The legendary Toyota Corolla \u2013 an import-killer. The legendary Toyota Prius \u2013 (???). The legendary Tesla \u2014 GM EV1.\n    The legendary GT40 is part of the history of Ford, and therefore an integral part of the history of the American automobile industry. From world domination and greatness to collapse and bankruptcy. And if the latter since 2009 has been lying alone on one scale of Themis, then after watching the film Ford v. Ferrari we know exactly what to put on the other side - the only (!) Victory of the American car industry.\n   And thanks to the brilliant work of the filmmakers, we have learned the main thing. The persons behind the victories and collapse. Those who determine the final result. Creators - Ken, Shelby, Enzo. And consumers like Leo Beebe, \"the group\", the GM guys.\n\n\nP.S. \n    And no tears at the end. Ken didn't want that. For a Warrior, there is no better death than the one that found him in battle. That was the way Ken left. The way Gagarin left. The way few of us left...\n     And it does not matter that one flew into space, and the other drove at Le Mans. What matters is that we have all seen the two \"perfect laps\": around the Earth and on the Le Mans track. And that is magnifiscent!..",

            "content": "While it sputters out of the start, the back half of Ford v. Ferrari is such exquisite movie watching that I'd recommend the film to anyone, not just your local, neighborhood \"car guy\". Christian Bale, for once with a British accent, is our speed-junkie, Ken Miles. Ken is a sympathetic character who pairs well with Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon), a household name for motorheads, who had been a part of the winning team for the insane, 24-hour Les Mans race. Their friendship is a highlight of the movie \u2014 especially when it comes to the stunts (no pun intended) Shelby pulls to put Miles in a position to succeed. Ford II (Tracy Letts) in the car with Shelby was definitely the funniest scene. The movie is full of car porn and motorhead porn, which I still appreciated even though I don't know about automobile minutia \u2014 I'll assume it's very authetic. It's a long movie, clocking in at 152 minutes, but the \"race scene\" never really dulls, to my surprise. The Ford v. Ferrari rivalry was understandable, but the rivalry (or \"hatred\" is really the better word) between Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) and Miles felt forced. At every turn (again, no pun intended) Beebe attempted to sabotage Miles to the point you'd think the racer fucked his wife. It seemed like a forced way for the movie to create a villain. The ending to the race was a jaw-dropper, but not in the way you'd expect. At least real recognized real, when Enzo (Remo Girone) tipped the cap. I had been putting this one off because I don't really care for racing movies, but it also offers a piece of history, a couple of great storylines, and the US of A stickin' it to the Europeans \u2014 something I can always get behind.",

The compelling story offers tense, on-the-edge-of-your-seat moments, especially in the final race, that ditches typical racing movie tropes and sticks to the true experiences of Miles.

There are also so many cliches in the film from the bad suit men to the kid who is there to show a kinder side of the foul-mouthed angry lead character. The screenplay is so boring and unfunny which really drags the film down. I also thought that Bale put on a really English accent just to cater to the American audience. However, the cinematography and the driving sequences were really impressive and put some life back into the film. The film was nominated for the Oscar for Best Picture in 2020 and was the weakest out of all the nominees. The film deservedly won the Oscar for Best Sound Editing and Best Film Editing. Overall, a cookie-cutter film which left me pretty disappointed due to liking much of Mangold's other work.",

I'm not much into race cars or racing, but at the end of the day, despite the fact that this movie was based on true events, it's more than just about racing and race cars. FvF is about the drive of competition, what it means to be a team player and what being smart looks like. I thoroughly enjoyed the performances Matt Damon and Christian Bale gave as their characters and loved the dynamic and chemistry the two had. The two had memorable moments that made many scenes of this movie hit hard and be really entertaining. The story and script are also great; the dialogue is really good and the way the movie progresses allows for the characters to change a little bit and develop really cool relationships with each other. The film flows really well; it does have some awkward moments for the characters, but those moments don't disrupt the flow of the movie and more serve to show us who these characters are at their core. The characters have some absolutely savage lines in this movie that show that they have a pair of balls on them and that they aren't afraid to be who they are. FvF is also a movie about being you and not being afraid to stand up to someone or tell them that they're wrong when you know for a fact that they are wrong, even if that someone is a friend. FvF also exemplifies the concept that sometimes the experience can be just as satisfying as the victory, even if you don't win. There is a bigger point here that I'm trying to make, which is this: FvF may be fundamentally about the rivalry between Ford and Ferrari regarding the 24 hours of the Le Mans, but it has so much else going on in it that it'll be able to appeal to audiences who, like me, aren't into racing or race cars that much. People can appreciate this movie for a lot of different reasons, which is one reason why it's so good to me and why I was just as entertained watching this movie the second time as I was the first time. I think I appreciated it more when I was able to see it not just for its filmmaking technique but for its bigger themes and messages. This movie may not have won the academy award for best picture, but for me it's a must-see and I strongly recommend it for people even if they don't care much for its premise.",

Some people find ways to insult other countries or attack the movie get this on its characters being too stereotyped, and seemed to be somehow put off because the head of Ferrari was stereotypically Italian.  Gee,  imagine the head of Ferrari coming accross as having traits that you could call stereotypical Italian, what do people expect, that the writer should make all the italians in the movie act like Germans just for the sake of \u2018originality'.\nI have to say i wasn't sure about this movie and it actually took me two viewings to decide what i really felt about it.  When doing a movie like this with great show down of characters facing off against each other almost always only through pure dialogue, it isn't easy to be original anymore.  It really had most all been done especially with period pieces or biographies.  So rather the  focus on trying to feel completely original on the situations or say execs vs engineers etc the writers went instead for not worrying about that Enzo was stereo typical Italian, or Ken had stereo typical english in his manerism. because behind that they laid out some actual interesting character that had to many times be more nuanced on top of that familiar structure and the details of character we original.  Scenes like when Ford is crying after Shelby takes him for a real test of the cars abilities, and the crying was unexpected and switched from joy to fear all together, he was proud and joyful of what his company had made, a true engineering marvel he even brought up how much he wished his father could see this moment and what a truly amazing machine he just experienced.  All the while literally being truly scared for his lif and darn if he didn't play Ford beautifully again in the subtles of his acting, being able to convey this smug man used to 100% absolute authority his entire life.  \nI think Christian Bale always delivers real moments of character and he doesn't fail here again, and though i felt Matt Damon was reaching just a bit during only a few scenes and the rest were great, his strongest moments are with Ken's son at the end, and the subtles of Ken's kid is really wel played and never over stated.  If one were to be judgemental and not really take in the movie enough to capture that nuanced character details i really can then see one missing the best parts of this movie.  And that contrast between subtle character being revealed and them dirty load death machines pushes to the edge of their ability to stay together, and keep the driver safe, i think really did well holding my attention through the movie.  It wasn't perfect, could have probably lost a few scenes but i was left with a happy feeling i had watched it.  Despite the sadness at the end...",

Starring two of the best actors of this generation, Matt Damon and Christian Bale, the film takes us on a journey of friendship, egos, automotive rivalry, and determination. I was unaware of Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles and the history that they had in racing. Going into the movie not knowing anything, it made for a great lesson in the history of racing. Both the actors are effortless in their acting, and both actors look like they had incredible fun while doing the film. James Mangold, who directed the excellent Logan and some solid biopics in Girl Interrupted and Walk The Line, directs this film really well. He educates the audience but doesn't shy away from bringing the fun factor into the equation. The racing scenes are loud and exciting. They are shot in such a real and grounded way, and it offers a different perspective to how we see the lives of car racers. Josh Lucas and Jon Bernthal are standouts as Ford executives in the supporting cast. Cinematography is also really splendidly done, and seeing all the recreations of the classic Shelby GT cars is a really great kick for any car lover out there. And for a film that runs at 2 and half hours, you can barely feel the film lag as its paced at a really good rate. The film does go on familiar and predictable grounds at times, but that familiarity works in its favour for the most part. Go watch it once it comes out!",

Anyone not the good guys has the demeanor of a tiresome parade of stereotypical movie villains- the Ferrari drivers could be Nazi extras in any number of WW2 flicks, the Ford execs are either spineless lackeys, effete dicks, or conniving players. Henry Ford II portrayal seems informed by every crooked politician, tyrannical corporate overlord, or contemptible small town sheriff. \nThe whole thing just felt played out, race scenes & otherwise.

Damon delivers a solid performance while Bale's may be a little lacking.  For his role, Bale must adopt an English accent.  Rather than sounding like a Brit from Birmingham, he sounds like an American impersonating Michael Caine.  The acting chemistry between Damon and Bale is poor.  A really big asset in this movie is the performance of the supporting cast.  Most notable is Josh Lucas as the unlikable, power hungry executive who steps in the way.  Ray McKinnon also deserves high praise.  The film has good production value, with technological advancements over the last few decades resulting in vastly improved action scenes (as compared to older racing films).  Numerous sub-plots exist within the movie to keep things interesting.  A really good film that does not emotionally drain nor intellectually overtax the audience.",

            "content": "Directed by James Mangold, Ford v Ferrari, is one of the few modern masterpieces of the film industry. The film tells the true story of Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles building the famed Ford GT-40 to race at the most well-known race in the world, the 24-hours at Le Mans, France. The film is incredibly skillfully-developed thanks to the production team, the writers, the cinematographers, the costume artists, and the composers for the film's score, Marco Beltrami and Buck Sanders. It draws you into its world immediately because of this, and even if you do not have that much of an interest in cars, you are suddenly invested in this story. The film is littered with beautiful, truth-filled little nuggets about fatherhood, brotherhood, humility, and familial love. As far as the accuracy of the events, it is altered slightly for the sake of the story-telling, while not degrading the human dignity of the real persons the film is about. Most films to come out of Hollywood these days are over-sexualized in any way they can be, the family is seen as a hindrance of sorts, and just degrade the dignity of the human person in any way they can; so, it is quite refreshing to watch a modern film that does none of these things, but rather promotes the dignity of the human person and the beauty in the relationship between two best friends, a husband and his wife, and a father and his son. I see the film as inspiring to anyone who has ever been afraid to take risks for their family, to stand up to the status quo, which is very difficult to do in our culture today. Because it is a true story, the film is motivated by and relevant to the human experience of these men going up against some of the best race cars in the world while dealing with some very uncooperative executives. In regard to the character Ken Miles and his family, I think the film does a beautiful job of showing the balance he carries between his love for cars and his love for his family. The film spends a great deal of time portraying the beauty of Ken's relationship with his wife and son. There is an attitude awareness about how important the family really is in our daily lives. In the film you get to see Ken share more than a few moments of mutual love and friendship between him and his wife, as well as some beautiful teaching moments between him and his son that I believe (although they are talking about racing) points towards the Divine. I give this film a 5/5 stars! I would highly recommend this film to anyone I meet, and I highly encourage you to sit with the themes it portrays so beautifully!",

In reality, at racing speeds sum total one thing consumes all the racer's visual attention: their path on the racing course.  \n\nConversely, several times during this flick, two racers are side by side allegedly at extreme race speed, with one item being the sole source of their visual attention, staring down their opponent, both heads turned 90 degrees from the race track. \n \nSuch lack of visual focus would in reality result in an almost immediate crash of both vehicles, both flipping, and two fatalities for the vehicles portrayed in this race.  \n\nModern directors seem to be immune to the vagaries of reality in race scenes as described.\n\nThere are several other almost constant fallacies in movie land: in all movies wherein someone wears a full helmet covering the entire head (space suit, exposure suit, under water, etc.), there is always a light illuminating the wearer's face.  In reality, any such light does only one thing, which is to blind the helmet wearer.  Think of driving at night with high beams in your face, not for a moment, but permanently, everywhere you look.\n\nAnother: for all persons occupying a vehicle, for unknown reason the vehicle manufacturer has installed a lamp illuminating that persons face, whether it's day or night time, and especially at night time.  It is just so stupid, imbecilic to see this light.  It makes the movie or TV show seem cartoonish.  \n\nLastly, Re. underwater flicks: in the ocean, unless its tropical and almost crystal clear, the only light below 100 feet is artificial.   Yet the directors often show all this natural light at extreme depths where no natural light exists.",

These scenes are entertaining but such scenes also make the characters of Ford v Ferrari feel more like caricatures than fleshed out personages.  And none of the performances here are particularly noteworthy - Bale tries on a fake British accent that I thought was Australian until I came to write this review and Tracy Letts as Henry Ford is cartoon-like in his reactions.  Nevertheless, the film embraces these characters wholeheartedly and the childish antics of Ford v Ferrari prove quite some fun to watch.  Meanwhile, the racing scenes are superb and really capture a sense of death-defying speed.  Ford v Ferrari is no work of art, but it is a crowdpleaser.

Academy Award winning writer Matt Damon and Academy Award winning actor Christian Bale are both very good in their respective roles.  Bale steals every scene he is in as the late Ken Miles.  Watching Bale's scenes of his behind the wheel are nothing short of exhilarating.  Despite knowing the outcome of Le Mans, I found myself becoming very involved in the racing scenes.  Considering the fact that we know how the race would end as I mentioned, that is quite an accomplishment.  The racing scenes in the film are very well done.  Masterfully filmed.  They alone make the movie worth watching.  My only criticism is a few formulaic scenes.  For example, the scenes where Ford executives try to convince Matt Damon's character to replace Ken Miles with a driver who is more fitting for the Ford Racing Team.  That I did not care for.  That aside, \"Ford vs. Ferrari\" is a movie that works on many levels and is definitely worth your time.",

Enzo Ferrari however, uses Ford's offer to secure a more lucrative deal with Fiat that allows him to retain complete ownership of Scuderia Ferrari. In rejecting the proposed deal with Ford, Ferrari also intentionally insults both Ford Motor and Henry Ford II. In response, a furious Ford orders his racing division to build a car to defeat Ferrari at Le Mans. For this task, Iacocca hires Shelby American owner Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon), a former driver who won Le Mans in 1959 but was forced to retire due to a heart condition. In turn, Shelby enlists the help of Ken Miles (Christian Bale), a hot-tempered British racer and struggling mechanic, and Shelby's best friend. Shelby and Miles test the Ford GT40 Mk I prototype at Los Angeles International Airport, working out all of its design flaws until it is race-ready. Seeing that Miles is not their ideal driver, Ford opts to send Phil Hill and Bruce McLaren to the 1965 24 Hours of Le Mans instead. As predicted by Miles, none of the Fords finish the race. While Ford sees this as a humiliating defeat, Shelby explains to him that the GT40 instilled fear in Enzo Ferrari, as it reached 218 mph (350.8 km/h), on the Mulsanne Straight before it broke down. Shelby and Miles continue development on the GT40 Mk II, but Miles is nearly killed when the car has brake fade during testing. In 1966, Ford Senior Vice President Leo Beebe takes over the racing division, with the intent to continue the program without Miles, but Shelby gives Ford a ride in the car and wagers his own company to convince Ford to agree that if Miles wins the 24 Hours of Daytona, he will be allowed to race at Le Mans...\n\nRotten Tomatoes critics consensus reads, \"Ford v Ferrari delivers all the polished auto action audiences will expect \u2013 and balances it with enough gripping human drama to satisfy non-racing enthusiasts.\" Mick LaSalle of San Francisco Chronicle gave the film a 4 out of 4 stars, saying that it \"is what it promises to be, a blast from the past\" and writing: \"Ford v Ferrari could have just been a sports story, dramatizing an interesting chapter in racing, and it would have been fine. But in showing Ford and his minions' constant interference in the dedicated work of Miles and Shelby, this James Mangold film becomes a tale of souls battling the soulless.\" Eric Kohn of Indiewire gave the film a \"B\", saying that \"Ford v Ferrari excels at evoking the sheer thrill of the race\u2014'a body moving through space and time', as one character says\u2014and it's compelling enough in those moments to make the case that nothing beats the thrill of competition.\" Variety's Peter DeBruge praised the racing sequences and the performances of Bale and Damon, writing: \"The best sports movies aren't so much about the sport as they are the personalities, and these two go big with their performances.\"\n\nNot really a car fan nor a racing fan, but this is a quite nice piece of film based on the true story of Ford\u00b4s wish to win the Le Mans race in France against Ferrari in 1966. Biopics are always hard to embrace in my opinion, as you never will know what\u00b4s really the truth, but in the case of \"Ford v Ferrari\" it\u00b4s so well made you simply don\u00b4t think about it. We get great direction from James Mangold and superb photography by the DoP Phedon Papamichael. The 60s comes truly alive down to the smallest details in this film. Christian Bale is great as Ken Miles and Matt Damon is solid as Carroll Shelby. The film has some fantastic racing sequences and scenes that are truly well made with beautiful 60s racing cars. It\u00b4s engaging, emotional and exciting on a high level. Thumbs up for \"Ford v Ferrari\". \n\nTrivia: It was chosen by the National Board of Review as one of the ten best films of the year, and at the 92nd Academy Awards received four nominations, including Best Picture, and won Best Film Editing and Best Sound Editing. It was the last film to win the Academy Award for Best Sound Editing before the award was combined with Best Sound Mixing as a single award for Best Sound. Bale also received nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Drama and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role.",

All this built up , working hard and it leads up to ken milles dying, are you serious bro. This movie could have been one of the greats of 2019 but lost because he died off in the background and also because he lost the big race. At first I was a little disappointed that he lost but I understood why he did that but him dying in the background of the movie ending the movie on a sad note is terrible. Leaving the theater I just felt let down and I don't know what the director intended but this is not a happy movie and I will never watch this movie again. I just wished it ended differently because the first 2 hours and 20 something minutes were flat out awesome but man those last 10 minutes can make or break a movie. If the middle 10 minutes sucked then I could forgive that but the ending nah. Christian bale deserves an Oscar for best supporting actor. Academy just give it to bale already. He was hands down the best part of this movie and brought the character to life and made it so special.",

But what it turned out to be was SO much better and I was absolutely shocked by the emotions in this story.  At one point tears were shed when the perfect lap was run and again at the end when Shelby came to pay his respects with the wrench.  The tie up at the end of the movie sadly lacked a little, but the wrench was a masterpiece of bringing the story back around from the very beginning.

It seemed by the marketing it was a historical movie that only gear heads would appreciate so it really turned off a lot of people initially myself included a movie about a rivalry in the car industry, yeah and?   Was my initial reaction.  But this movie had many layers that the trailer didn't acknowledge.  The cooperate interference, the disdain that executives had for the rank and file workers, a pitcher battle between college educated businessman and trade educated automobile technicians .  Class war between  the rich (Beebe) and the poor (miles), how the rich will prevent the poor for succeeding.  Cooperative teamwork (Shelby motors) vs individual greed (corporate ambition) friendship, post ww2 life, father son bonds, a reinvention of a race car driver to a business owner(Shelby), European snobbery against American Grit,   had this been the marketing my guess is it wouldn't be in the surface looked at as another gear head movie.  There were so many vs in this movie the worst title they could of picked was ford vs Ferrari.  It starts off slow but the friendship is really what grabs you and the striving for perfection.  The one drawback is the entire movies premise is to increase the slumping sales of ford motor company and all this drama is based on that. Thoroughly enjoyable, characters with fatal flaws, arcs of character development. Overall a worthy 2.5 hours of story telling",

Enzo Ferrari's no legendary feud with the Ford Motor Company and their American bravado takes a back seat to the internal battles within Ford itself. The cumbersome bureaucracy that's laid upon Carol Shelby and team becomes the primary arc while the Ferrari stuff becomes something you almost forget about. It's as if Mangold couldn't commit to one well defined story arc so instead he chose two (even three) janky subplots. Racing fans will also notice the big miss of brushing over the two man racing teams at Le Mans in favor of the Ken Miles going at it alone presentation. Part of the the thrill of Le Mans is how the two man teams feed off of each others stamina - can you even name the second driver in the films climatic final race? Still, if you like powerful acting and Americana history, this is very much worth watching. Just know that it could have been so much better.",

Some of the Ford people are douches, but our two heroes are making things work. Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and Ken Miles (Christian Bale) are the car engineer and the driver. Ken is driving and tasting the car every day for months. He is telling the crew what to do and they do it. When the Le Mans is due, they must have the perfect car.\n\nInteresting biography with great editing and effects. Effects that looks nice, not flashy or overdone. The acting is incredible and Bale is once again doing an especially amazing job. It's a long ride, maybe a bit too long. Some loose threds here and some turns I don't really get. Some unneccessary scenes that doesn't impress or give much are also a little downer. In total a good film that deserves a go, but won't be remembered as one of the years top 10 movies.\n\n7.5 out of 10 wrenches.",

I don't understand them and don't particularly want to do so. Which is why this film had little attraction for me. \n\nBut it was Easter weekend, and it was on cheap to rent, and at wife's recommendation (who had seen it in the cinema), we watched it. I still have no interest in cars and engines, having watched it. There were parts of the dialogue I didn't understand a word of - or more correctly, I understood most of the words, but not the order they were used in. Those parts of the script I did understand seemed often to be lazy and far too much on the nose. Christian Bale's performance is odd to the point of being unintentionally laughable; replete with Mary Poppins-like Britishisms which sound out of place even coming from this British actor, whose accent in this film is hard to take seriously. On the other hand, Matt Damon is quietly brilliant, very possibly his best performance in many years; unshowy, subtle and investing his character with a depth the script never reaches. \n\nThere remain other inadequacies in the film: a ludicrous brawl between the two lead characters, and a pathetic reduction of women to roles which support or prop-up the men, peering through curtains, fetching drinks, adorning visuals. Why are cars always referred to in the feminine? It became more obvious to me here; because it enables the men who drive them and build them to continue to exploit them and shape them around their needs the way they do with women in their lives. \n\nIn the end, this is little more than a genre sports film, following all of the standard story beats of sports films to a conclusion I knew was coming as a sports fan with only a very passing knowledge of motorsport. It's a true story, but no less generic for it. But it does work - motorsports are the most cinematic of sports, not least because we have much of the film grammar of them drilled into us by car chases and the like. The racing scenes are adrenalised, gripping and alarming - the louder your sound system and the larger your screen, the more you'll enjoy them. They are beautifully directed; and throughout the whole film, the cinematography is subtle but strikingly beautiful. There's much to enjoy and entertain, perfect for a holiday weekend. But it will fade from the memory quickly, the only lingering question being why it garnered so much attention on cinematic release at the expense of far superior films from female directors.",

The sound department also deserves recognition. The rip roaring sound of the engines will get ones chest thumping. \n\n\nBale gives an incredible performance. Constantly pumping energy in to every scene. Even in his care he's giving a hilarious running commentary in his Brummie accent. Damon's performance is a little more subdued compared to his counterpart. Yet, behind his soulful eyes lies regret and anguish of not being able to race no more. \n\n\nFord V Ferrari can be cliched for some. It's very much an underdog picture, that follows similar to beats as Rocky or Moneyball... but in race cars. However, as someone who enjoys them kind of flicks, it's a thoroughly entertaining white-knuckle thrill ride.",

            "content": "Ford v Ferrari (AKA Le Mans 66 in some European countries) is a story based on the rivalry between Ford and Ferrari in the 60s. It's a sport biopic of sorts with the characters of Ken Miles played by Christian Bale and Carolle Shelby played by Matt Damon of course being real individuals. The story of course exaggerates lots of things for the sake of dramatisation even more than other films so it isn't necessary a typical biopic. The film is directed by James Mangold who directed the masterful film \"Logan\" but the film certainly feels drastically different from Logan. Still, I came in with high expectations because James Mangold directed it and plus all the oscar buzz around the film.\n\nFirstly, the story is very compelling and engaging for a film about racing cars. The human drama between the Ford executives and the main characters is very natural albeit cliche. However, the director manages to balance out the racing with the human drama naturally so that none become too overwhelming or boring. Despite being titled \"Ford v Ferrari\" the film is more about the clash of Miles and Shelby against the meddling executives. The heart and passion of Miles/Shelby with the cold and calculative business choices of the executives is really the heart and soul of the film with some added bonus of intense racing. There are a lot of poignant and genuinely heart warming touching moments but with some funny moments and that is not normal for these type of films. Secondly, Both Christian Bale and Matt Damon give great performances with strong chemistry between the two that makes the friendship more believable. The supporting cast Jon Berthal, Caitriona Balfe,Tracy Letts give good performances as well and definitely do well in making the world more alive. Special mention to Josh Lucas who I say is the REAL antagonist of this film by somehow being suave but absolutely detestable. Thirdly, the race scenes are incredibly done and intense with great wide shots and none of the shaky camera garbage. The film really excels at creating exciting and thrilling auto action which is in part thanks to excellent score by Marco Beltrami and Buck Sanders. The score captures the electrifying race scenes but also uses score and music from the 60s to elevate the era the film is set in.Likewise, the sound and sound editing in this film are done perfectly as I could feel the engine turning or when the gears change. It's just really good.\n\nI do have some issues with this film and the first is the amount of cliches used by this film. The monologue at the beginning being used at the end again, Ken Miles being the typical cliche underdog character from a sports film, the montage with the amount of failures, the main character knowing more than the experts and machines etc. The cliches are done masterfully but it did surprise me a lot about how many cliches were in this film. My other minor issue has got to be the run time which is at 152 minutes. The pacing of this movie is mostly fine but there are certain points in this movie after they build the car where it just kind of drags. These are mostly in the scenes where there are paperwork or meetings where it just feels a bit too long for no reason. \n\nOther than some minor nitpicks, the movie is almost near perfect. The film is carried by great performances with thrilling car scenes but some genuinely touching and funny moments. The movie drives you along a road of contrasting emotions that leads you to an exciting finishing line. Give this film a watch.",

I personally hate evil versus good stereotype thing whatsoever in any film. Oh, and if you are an American, you might like this, since it seems very nationalistic movie to me. I fucking hate nationalism or any political ideas becoming a overall theme of movie, whether it is a minor theme or major theme. Still, it is not an awful movie. Probably good for time killing.",

After watching for 30 minutes, it's hard to find someone who can truly be looked up to in the movie.",

His paternal duties were written with the likeness of Ward Cleaver but with less chemistry if you can imagine that.

Personally, I thought Christian Bale's performance was a huge standout. His portrayal seemed honest and caring with a sense of fun. However, other than that, I thought the acting with just about average. James Mangold did an incredible job with this movie. It's crazy to think that this is the same guy that did Logan. Visually, I had no problems with it, the editing was the only real memorable take away in terms of technical stuff. But really, the action is what makes this movie works. All of the things mentioned above come together for the amazing action sequences and make the movie work. However, due to certain performances, some action sequences, and a few smaller problems, I give this movie a 4/5. Nevertheless, a really enjoyable experience.",

Though there is a lot of  mechanical jargon that went over my head and probably many others, the film's adrenaline-packed and heart-pounding racing sequences are edited nimbly, rendering them ideal for the big screen. There is something satisfyingly American about watching Miles crank up the Ford GT40's RPM and zip past his opponents, even though he is a Rosy Lee-drinking Cockney. It only enhances the experience really.\n\nThe film takes its time setting up its premise, which contributes unnecessarily to its two-and-a-half hour runtime. Once the team begins prototyping the GT40, this is when the film gets interesting. While exhilarating, \"Ford v Ferrari\" is ultimately empty. While there is plenty of time to inject the narrative with more characterization and heart, much of the film is spent instead on Shelby's corporate battle to get Miles behind the wheel. While their friendship is well established, the film fails to delve into Ken and Carroll's backstories.\n\nThese issues are made apparent by Miles's sudden change of heart during his final lap at Le Mans. Why does he make the decision he does? Out of respect for the other Ford drivers? Out of love for the Ford Motor Company? For Shelby? This point seems completely unexplored, but this is really not what the film is about anyway. Despite this one incongruous scene, the film does what it does well. Once the racing starts, the film grips you and never lets go. Bolstered by superb performances from Christian Bale and Matt Damon (and Tracy Letts in one unexpected emotional scene), \"Ford v Ferrari\" is a worthwhile movie-going experience.",

And leaves you right on the edge. James Mangold's direction did it great with its exciting racing sequences which is loud, thrilling, and intense. The drama and story building with Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and Ken Miles (Christian Bale) are also great and gripping with its story. The script, direction, and performances are outstanding. The plot follows when Henry Ford (Tracy Letts) wants to try to make the fastest car for the 24 hours of Le Mans race in France. He has Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) try to help and rebuild a Ford GT40 and has a race car driver Ken (Christian Bale) try to test the cars and compete in the 24 hour race. Racing against Lorenzo who is racing for Ferrari. It is a long movie of 2 hours and 30 so minutes. But it goes by fast with its gripping and sharp script. The characters are great. Carroll designs cars and is unable to race from his heart condition. While Ken is a struggling mechanic, trying to support his family. He brings his son around when he is building sports cars. Ken also hates when the executives and bosses from Ford tries to tell him what to do. Which makes their relationship and partnership unstable. The script is sharp with its storytelling. The direction is moving with a building story and thrilling race sequences. The racing scenes are pedal to the metal intense. The cinematography in putting the cameras on the streets of racing cars flying by. Or right in the driver side of the car puts you right into the race. Christian Bale and Matt Damon delivered the performances. They are awesome playing the characters. Overall, Ford v Ferrari is one of the best movies of the year. It is exciting.

            "content": "It's not the car that wins the race, but the driver.\n\nJames Mangold's historical action-drama Ford v Ferrari (2019) is a riveting drama with exhilarating car races. You'd think Ford v Ferrari would be an overly macho, testosterone driven, dad film for desperate adrenaline junkies, but it ends up as a moving tribute to race car driver Ken Miles. Mangold pays homage to Ken Miles and Carroll Shelby for their tireless contributions to improving sports cars' designs and engineering. I was worried Ford v Ferrari was going to be a massive ad for Fords, but you actually end up respecting the craftsmanship and class of Ferrari more and Ford looks grossly incompetent, pathetically shallow, and disgustingly greedy. If anything, James Mangold criticizes the toxic masculinity, unbelievable arrogance, and cold corporatism of Ford's Senior Vice President Leo Beebe that cost Miles his Le Mans title. So, Ford v Ferrari is worth seeing for its unreal racing action, stunning cinematography, outstanding acting, and peerless direction.\n\nJames Mangold's direction is breathtaking as he sends cars flying into horrible crashes, while simultaneously filming touching conversations about why people love driving. His attention to detail in recreating 1966 is pretty flawless and impressive. I found Mangold's direction for all the car driving sequences to be creative and interesting, but many of the talking drama ends up feeling lackluster. Overall, James Mangold is a phenomenal director with a clear and compelling vision for Ford v Ferrari.\n\nChristian Bale is really entertaining with a heavy British accent as the abrasive Ken Miles. He plays by his own rules, yet comes across as a genuine family man that just likes to race as a hobby. His brilliant natural racing talent and astounding auto knowledge after just racing a car is intriguing. Matt Damon is brilliant as Carroll Shelby. Damon has a fun chemistry with Bale as they portray Miles and Shelby as having a nice friendship. Their dedication to sports car development, family attention, and sincere friendship makes Ford v Ferrari a great movie.\n\nCaitriona Balfe is wonderful as Mollie Miles. Her chemistry with Bale was really natural and sweet. She seemed like an incredible woman. Noah Jupe is respectful to Peter Miles with his devotion to his beloved father and mania for car parts and tinkering. His best scenes are the ones where he is worried his father could die in a car fire with genuine fear on his face. Ray McKinnon is likable as Phil Remington. His helpful skills aid Shelby and Miles in their quest for Le Mans victory. Enzo Ferrari is played by a stoic and passionate Remo Girone.\n\nTracy Letts is compelling as a gruff and irritable Henry Ford II. Josh Lucas is such a cruel and annoying jerk as Leo Beebe. He makes the Ford Senior Vice President seem like a loathsome fake and meddlesome fool. Jon Bernthal comes across good as Lee Iacocca. His authentic love for cars feels very real, especially as Bernthal admires what Ken Miles and Carroll Shelby are accomplishing.\n\nMarco Beltrami and Buck Sanders' score is thrilling, especially during all the races. Paul Massey, Donald Sylvester, and David Gianmarco's sound editing is awe-inspired with their loud bursts of car explosions and crashes with visceral noises.\n\nPhedon Papamichael's cinematography is fabulous no matter what kind of scene is occurring. The outside night conversation between Miles and his son is wonderful as well as the heartfelt talks between Miles and Shelby. They have beautiful framing. All the sunlight and nighttime shadows are fascinating to look at in Ford v Ferrari.\n\nOn the other hand, any of the corporate scolding from Ford's CEO are the most bland and oddly written scenes of basic grandstanding. Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, and Jason Keller's uninspired dialogue is so strange for such a passionate movie. I liked Bale's random British taunts in the car while Miles is racing, but they are not great writing really.\n\nMichael McCusker, Dirk Westervelt, and Andrew Buckland's editing is so slick and exciting that Ford v Ferrari's 152 minutes speed by like Miles in his Ford sports car. They accomplish these hard cuts that soar high above much of their contemporaries. \n\nIn conclusion, Ford v Ferrari is worth a watch for Christian Bale's sympathetic performance as Ken Miles. I truly think that Bale was robbed of acting awards and that Miles should be remembered fondly for his masterful racing ability. Rest in peace, Ken Miles.",

Just that it was marketed inaccurately. When I was keeping myself abreast of this project, it seemed very much that the insinuation was that the movie would be a battle between Bale's and Damon's respective characters. That this would essentially be the run-through of the whole film, and the climax would feature one emerging victorious over the other. In actual fact, the opposite is true. Ford v Ferrari is largely about the friendship and partnership of those two characters. An occasionally rugged, and one occasion even violent friendship, but a friendship nonetheless. Even the title is misleading. I suppose Ford does v Ferrari at a couple of points over the movie's runtime, but it's not what Ford v Ferrari is about. In fact, Ferrari barely features in the movie at all. Here's the kicker though: I actually liked what this thing ended up being, more than I think I would have enjoyed a movie that really did revolve around Bale actually versing Damon, or one about Ford actually versing Ferrari.",

            "content": "If Ford v Ferrari feels formulaic that's because it is, but it works. It has all the elements of a traditional major studio sports movie: based on a true story, A-list movie stars, acclaimed journeyman director, fabulous cinematography, a motley crew of characters challenging conventions, an underdog angle. A more generous analogy would be Ford v Ferrari takes a reliable recipe and uses the best ingredients and best kitchen brigade to deliver an entr\u00e9e so well done it is almost easy to dismiss. That is almost what happened with this movie. After coming and going at the box office just before Thanksgiving, it seems the Academy couldn't dismiss this film entirely and gave it four Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. They were right to not let Ford v Ferrari pass without notice because, though it is working with a familiar recipe, this is an excellently done, engaging entertainment.\n\nLike the title directly states, this movie is about rival car companies. Specifically, it is about the nascent Ford racing program in the mid 1960's taking on the dominant force in international racing, Ferrari. Like a lot of sports movies, you could argue that this movie isn't so much about the sport but about the characters and their journey. Ford v Ferrari is certainly about car racing but what is most engaging about it is the friendship between its main characters, racer turned car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and racer Ken Miles (Christian Bale). After a slump in sales, ambitious Ford executive Lee Iacocca hatches a plan to revitalize the car company's image by entering the world of international auto racing and winning the prestigious marathon race 24 Hours at Le Mans. Ford turns to Shelby to head their racing program. Shelby, turns to the best driver he knows, Miles, who is the right driver for the job but does not fit the Ford company image.\n\nAt first the accents from the leads are a bit jarring. Damon is using a full Texas drawl and Bale uses a British accent not his own. Accents aside, Damon and Bale settle into the their characters quickly and comfortably. They are A-list stars that give A-list performances with great on-screen chemistry. Damon as the determined no-nonsense Shelby and Bale as the skilled but at times abrasive Miles (he's described as \"not a people person\") are not exactly a mismatched pair; they're more like yin and yang. Their best scene together is also the funniest in the movie: they fight each other with groceries. Shelby has a canned good in his hand, realizes that it would hurt Miles, so he hits him with a loaf of bread instead. Even when they are trying to hurt each other, they are trying not to hurt each other.\n\nThe real rivalry isn't between Ford and Ferrari but with race crew and the Ford executives who don't understand racing and are only concerned with corporate image, namely Josh Lucas as Leo Beebee. Lucas is great performer but there's nothing to his character aside from being petty and obstructing Shelby and Miles. I did not care about the Ford motor company winning a race to gain prestige and sell more cars so rich men could be slightly richer. But I did care about Shelby and Miles succeeding. Watching them and their crew work together to solve the problems of building a state-of-the-art race car, with each member using their individual skills and knowledge, is a total delight. Those scenes reminded me of other film about people working together to solve a problem, The Martian, also starring Matt Damon, and also a Best Picture nominee. So, yes, in a film where the title flat out states conflict and rivalry, the best scenes are of people working together.\n\nDirector James Mangold is not a household name, even among cinephiles, but he turns out solid work more often than not. When directing Walk the Line he gave the concert scenes a distinct look by putting the camera backstage and even onstage with the performers instead of just placing it with the audience. He uses the same approach with Ford v Ferrari's racing scenes. There some shots of the cars zooming by the stands but there are also shots behind and in front of the cars on the track, inside the car with the Miles, POV shots of the racers, or shots where the camera has been attached the door of one of the speeding cars. It is all cut together to thrilling results (editor Andrew Buckland received an Oscar nomination for his work). Ford v Ferrari also picked up Oscar nominations in both Sound Mixing and Sound Editing. Those aren't just throw away nominations. The sound of the roaring engines, zooming cars, and, yes, explosions, are a major part of the immersive experience of the racing scenes. I have never had any interest in car racing of any kind, but the grueling climatic race at 24 Hours at Le Mans, where drivers race in four-hour shifts day and night no matter the weather conditions, had me completely enthralled. That's good filmmaking. I can see Ford v Ferrari being dismissed as a \"Dad Movie\"\u2014the kind of movie an adult child would watch with their dad over the holidays. If that is how you happen to see this picture, you and your dad are in luck.",

By pairing 2 good actors with ridiculous accents in a movie that made me dump popcorn all over my head and blow on a trumpet for 2 hours in the corner. Christian Bale loves the fact that his bottom teeth don't fit in his mouth?? we get it, I'm happy for you, but that's not acting. And Matt Damon talking about 7000 RPM's (90MPH?) like he's Chuck Yeagar breaking the sound barrier is so over the top. Plus this type of enduro racing is not easy to translate on screen. The wear and tear on the driver, the wear and tear on the hardware, it's about pushing to the limit where things should break but they don't. This racing actually takes 24 hours in real life for a reason, I get that it is hard to make exciting for people that don't \"Get it\" - So what does this movie do? (here comes the Hollywood execs) Every time a race car goes off the road it immediately explodes, bursting into flames... A Flat tire = bomb explosion,  And now I'm making popcorn snow angels in a fetal position. Come on guys. The movie is about big business \"Committees\" getting out of the way of the true individual \"Experts\" and letting the people who know what they are doing \"Win the race\" - Why didn't you make this movie with the same philosophey? Popcorn ruined, trumpet time over. Need a warm blanket. Thanks a lot.",

            "content": "Each year you will see at least one Best Picture nominee that appeals purely to the members of the Academy who have jobs related to the technical elements of making a film and well, fathers. It is easy to see why a film about a whole lot of men hanging out while trying to engineer a vehicle that will go fast and make the loud noises that appeal to the readers of Esquire magazine hit a nerve with this sort of viewer. I was quietly amazed that I found parts of the film that I really did enjoy and although it remains a film that is not targeted at me I can appreciate the fact that it fulfills a certain need in it's target audience. This is not to say that I think it should be showered with awards but it is a solid, if not particularly original, film that does the things that it does very well.\n\nHenry Ford II, Tracy Letts, decides to purchase the financially struggling Ferrari so that they can use the company's success at the Le Mans races as promotional material for their cars. When Ferrari backs out of the deal they leave Ford incensed and he vows to have his revenge by defeating Ferrari in an upcoming Le Mans race. This requires an investment of a lot of time and money from him and he pushes those who work for him very hard. He employs the services of charismatic American Carroll Shelby, Matt Damon, and tempestuous British racecar driver Ken Miles, Christian Bale, who has lost career opportunities in the past due to his temper. The men almost win the Le Mans race in 1966 as Shelby and Miles form a strong bond and despite the fact that McLaren wins due to a technicality they feel that they are victorious.\n\nSeveral times in the film we hear either Shelby or Miles describe the euphoria and out of body experience that comes with driving a car at over 700 kilometers per hour. The audience should really feel this excitement and understand what drives these men to do what they do as driving seems so dangerous and unnecessary. This is an issue with the whole film as the stakes feel so low with a group of wealthy men who work for a company that's sales have decreased but is by no means facing bankruptcy deciding to invest a lot of money in a competition that exists so that they can boost their egos. Where the concern for the characters should come in is with Miles but his problem feels so contrived and pops up in so many films of this type that we feel ourselves not caring. Add in the fact that this problem is solved thirty minutes into this very long film and you are left with a group of rich men engaging in a competition that has no bearing on their real lives and presents no real threat to themselves, that they have not voluntarily accepted, or their families.\n\nThe villains in the film also literally shake their fists and lick their lips as they size up Miles who is an \u2018underdog' despite his incredible abilities. Josh Lucas takes on possibly the most Josh Lucas role as the villainous Leo Beebe who often pins Miles with his piercing glare and regularly attacks him for seemingly no reason. While the role is poorly written and his motivations seem fairly unclear I do appreciate what a meal Lucas makes of the role as he knows that this is his niche and brings everything he can to the table. Beyond the writing of the ridiculous villains there is some awkward exposition dropped in at the beginning of the film that makes you cringe. We see Shelby looking out at a racetrack and have a supporting character ask him whether \"The rumors are true\" to which he responds \"What rumors?\" and has the other character proceed to explain his backstory. I have never been to a Screenwriting 101 class in my lifetime but I know that this is not how you are meant to provide a backstory for the characters in your film. \n\nThe film also felt bloated as we spend so much time out on the racetrack and this time could have been cut down as the repetitive shots of Bale with his sour face looking out at other drivers and then cutting back to exteriors have little impact on me. I could not be considered a motorhead and my dislike of this film proved that as maybe if I were a car enthusiast I would have cared more and been more compelled by the scenes of racing.",

Doesn't sound very thrilling, but the film has excitement to spare. The racing scenes are directing with panache and intensity, without having to resort to over the top camera work and obnoxious editing, and the off-track drama is just as entertaining. The narrative is essentially rich boys vs good ole boys, which has been done plenty of times before, but the struggle between them is told from both sides, so it doesn't feel like the film is simply pointing fingers. Both parties have clear agendas and goals, and its simply the case that those 2 things don't always perfectly align for both groups. Christian Bale, getting to do a British accent for once, is the performance the film will be recognised for, but Matt Damon certainly isn't slumming it, and deserves a lot of praise for his respectful portrayal of a motor racing legend. It also deserves praise for the way it brings a fascinating story to life, and celebrates a professional relationship that holds a special place in the annuls of motorsport history. Whether you're a racing fan or not, Ford v Ferrari is one of 2019's gems, and will hopefully be recognised a seminal car movie of the modern age.",

Armed, that is, with the financial backing (and all-too frequent corporate meddling) of Ford Motor Company. In that sense, it's a war on two fronts: they're playing catch-up against a more advanced opponent while also fending off the various obstacles and bad ideas tossed down from their own corporate brass.\n\nChristian Bale and Matt Damon, somehow sharing the screen for the first time, provide all the personality this flick needs to maintain momentum, while the hair-raising cockpit scenes nail the hairpin turns. Bale plays the more fiery of the pair; a sparky, cocksure driver who comes out of near-retirement for this chance at immortality. Damon's man is full of piss and vinegar, too, but more amicable to the kind of machinations necessary for navigating a corporate American boardroom. From the first word, they're great together. It's not an easy relationship to define - blows are exchanged, often comically, more than once - but there's no arguing their kinship, even if both might brush it off as a mere working association. They both know the fine points of their job, and the slight quirks and deviations that make them essential to one another.\n\nSeveral of the film's plot twists are telegraphed, even for those (like I) who didn't know the full story coming in, and it's guilty of occasionally dipping into the well of over-worn sports movie tropes, but otherwise it's an effective pulse-pounder.",

The noise and the driving experience are showacsed well. Almost everything is done to a very high standard. Both Damon and Bale are very good in this movie however I tip my hat to Damon despite being a massive Christian Bale fan. I think Matt Damon's character was the more interesting character and had better lines to say which tipped him over for me as the best actor in this movie. The writing for Damon's caharcter was superb. There is a good bad guy in this movie. There is something about the ending which ruins the enjoyment of this movie for me just a smidge. That is technically not the movies fault and is more the fault of reality itself. I will watch this movie again but because the story is so specific, knowing the ending means I am not in a race (wink, wink) to watch this movie again.",

I don't know much about him and throughout the movie he kept making these \"smug looks\". I didn't understand why they kept showing him. After a certain point in the movie he didn't do anything.

But now I do.\n\nFord v Ferrari could have easily gone the route of being a simple, crowd-pleasing, unassuming thrill ride. At times it was, but at other times it was much more. It gave me an insight into the fine art of auto racing, and all of the skills, crafts, and knowledge that go into it. It was fascinating to watch the protagonist's sixth sense of *feeling* the car, much like an equestrian can *feel* the needs of the horse. I applaud the film for being both a rockin' good time and an educational and enlightening experience. Much of this can be attributed to James Mangold. I always appreciate directors who can juggle a film in this way.  The raw entertainment moments and the heartfelt and moving scenes fit together exceptionally well. \n\nWhat a stellar ensemble cast. Christian Bale and Matt Damon, playing Miles and Shelby respectively, show extremely well developed characters; The movie wouldn't work as well if either of them had a single flat scene. Tracy Letts gives a memorable performance as Henry Ford II- his scene in the car with Shelby is among the most sidesplitting of the year. Caitriona Balfe and newcomer Noah Jupe also deserve recognition and credit for their believable performances. \n\nMuch of the film's greatness is due to the technical excellence. Before the audience sees even one frame of the movie proper, the title card sequence pulls them in with riveting sounds of speeding race cars. The sound design throughout the film, both the sound editing and sound mixing, is phenomenal. I was completely captivated and on the edge of my seat during all the racing scenes, and thanks to the sound, I felt like I was right there at the racetrack experiencing it all first hand. Also worth recognizing is the editing. An action movie of this nature really demands excellent editing, and Michael McCusker and Andrew Buckland sure do deliver. The intensity was very present in all of the race scenes, but there were also more subtle moments of excellent editing. In one scene, the movie alternated between Miles testing a car and Shelby arguing with some Ford executives. As tensions rose between Shelby and the Ford team, there would be quick cuts to Miles on the course, where the sound of the car continued to grow louder and louder, mirroring the rising tensions that Shelby was experiencing. There were several other subtle choices like this that all contributed to a very finely edited film. \n\nAs previously mentioned, I applaud this movie for being more than a generic action film. It has real widespread appeal, and I think that just about anyone will have a great time watching it. \n\n8/10.",

A movie that captures the brutal and unforgiving 24 Hours of Le Mans and the true story of how Ford de-throned Ferrari's domination of that legendary race. Now I must say the only film, of the same subject, that in my opinion ties or slightly edges out Ford vs. Ferrari in the racing cinematography is the 1971 film, Le Mans by Steve McQueen (with no C.G.I. effects and McQueen actually driving a Porche). Although thin on the back-story line, the race sequences capture the actual racing of Le Mans slightly better than Ford vs. Ferrari, which is more about the Shelby/Miles/Ford dynamic. All in all Ford vs. Ferrari is a very good film worth watching.",

It definitely stood out on its own, and I think I'll be able to think of this on a different plain as other car movies I've seen. Attention to detail is put on different things that you'd expect in car movies, and I'm glad for this because they're the most important parts of a good movie (in my opinion). For example, the cinematography. Most car movies use a very close claustrophobic camera with fast cut editing on random parts of the car, and Ford V Ferrari does do some of this, but objectively with a lot more style. I love how the camera cuts from the wheel of the car, and you just see enough of it to see it speeding up- and then to the speedometer, which you can see climbing steadily. So yea- I guess the editing is great too. On a performance standard, Christian Bale is the only one who really stood out to me in this film, everyone else being incredibly mediocre. He really seems like he's playing the role he's casted to, and not Christian Bale, which is I think a problem many actors struggle with. But for the downsides of this movie, there are a few. First of all, the whole movie is definite Oscar bait. Every scene is very cheesy and plays out exactly the way you'd expect it to, and there are of course the cheesy corporate villains, and all that crap...it's just stupid. The whole movie does stand out on its own, yes, but that's if someone else doesn't make another Oscar-baity car movie.",

Just a mad dash from no one knows where to no one knows where.\u271d\ufe0f\n\nLe Mans is above all an Endurance Race.  So, there is No Finish Line, only a line to mark the end of the lap, and, as we find out, there is no starting line either; just a mad dash to the finish of the race which is Twenty-Four Hours, hence, the name, and whoever travels the farthest in that time wins regardless of where they finish, but they must complete the last lap. \ud83d\ude07\n\nKen Miles is said by peers to have been TRUELY a gentleman in life I guess perhaps even more than in the film, though he was still outstandingly represented.  So much so that without knowing him, Christian Bale, and Matt Damon as well who did an equally amazing job, should consider another Britisher's comments, Cary Grant who said that he was not really like his screen personality (whether that is true or not) but that he liked the person that he created on the screen so much that he tried to become just like him.  Apparently he succeeded very well.  Everyone did a remarkable job.  Special Effects does not need IMAX to experience this ride. \u2626\ufe0f",

However, I felt like the film really tired to rise above a typical sports movie and it's typical underdog victory.\n\nIn conclusion, Ford v. Ferrari, despite its predictability, gives the audience a breathtaking yet heartfelt view of racing that will have you on the edge of your seat for its entirety.",

It skips a lot of the important history on this rivalry with no content about Carol Shelby's own banning as a driver with Ferrari or the Cobra Daytona coupe that won the GT class and was 4th overall at the 1964 Le Mans race.  They do show an unnumbered Daytona coupe in the garage scenes, but never talk about it or the early history of the rivalry.\n\nThere is a key flaw to this movie:  there are many historical inaccuracies in this movie.  Hence take it as a grain of salt.  This starts with Ken Miles drove in the 1964 Le Mans race and was not banned by Ford as presented in the movie.  The movie severely diminishes the role of Phil Remington, only citing his quick change brake innovation.  They gave full credit to Miles when it was actually Remington in the history books who fixed the chassis tuning and engine tuning issues with the GT40 race cars.  The races scenes were extremely inaccurate.  The Ferrari's of that time with their 4.0L V12 engines were not powerful enough to get anywhere near 200 mph, which the GT40's with their 7.0L V8's surpassed easily.   Hence all the side by side racing on the straight was just made up for the viewers.  The early race scenes of the Cobras against the Corvettes were also not accurate and the Cobras dominated the Corvettes at the track when they arrived in 1962.  \n\nBale does a good job with the role of Miles, but Damon struggles to keep his accent.  Tracy Letts does a great job in portraying Henry Ford II.",

James Mangold offers one of the best, if not the best sports movie ever. With award-worthy performances from both Christian Bale and Matt Damon, Ford v Ferrari (aka Le Mans \u201866) has characters so exceptionally-written and so emotionally compelling that I felt like crying by the end of the film. The races are riveting and entertaining, but it's the beautiful screenplay that gets me. Definitely, one of the movies of the year!\"",

It's the Matt Damon-ness of it all\u2013the American idealism where it's that extra unnameable force that gets the win in the end. Its heavy handed with the Big Bad Corporate evil of it all, especially when it seemed like Josh Lucas just wanted respect from Bale.

This movie focus on the moment when Ford decided they would beat Ferrari at the 1966 24 hour race of Le Man, and they ended up doing it. Christian Bale, my favorite actor, does his usual brilliant job in a performance that complements the main character but truly portrays his real-life counterpart. The racing sequences in this movie are very life-like and feel very authentic. I also appreciated the background scenery in this movie, it is certainly a very 60s esque movie. A lot of that credit goes to James Mangold, who you may know as the director of Logan, as he does a brilliant job as the director in this movie. This movies is very straightforward, is very well-paced, and does an excellent job in showing a real life story. This is an excellent movie and it is definitely worth your money!",

It is an action movie that offers the depth of emotions of those who believe in their calling. My husband and I loved the film.",

Matt Damon is his usual likable self as the retired racer and car designer Carroll Shelby and makes a solid and pleasant foil to Bales antics. The speedy ride falters slightly at the end but all in all, a very enjoyable way to spend an evening.",

            "content": "Ford v Ferrari is an instant classic! The film brings the story to life. The film will entertain anyone even if they don't know much about cars or racing. Christian Bale and Matt Damon are sensational as Miles and Shelby. I love especially Bale's Shelby the way that he keeps moving forward despite the challenges that he faces leading up to Le Mans. He represents the spirit inside all of us that we sometimes forget. Bale has his serious moments in the film but can also be quite comedic especially with his anger. He is so much funnier with his strong English accent. Bale has a great father-son connection with his son played by the amazing by Noah Jupe, which shows the heart of the film. Damon's Shelby is the heart of the film as his performance is exceptional. His optimism is pleasant and well needed in the film. He just wants to get the job done for Ford and doesn't want anything to get in his way. The Miles-Shelby friendship is touching and can also be funny as hell. In the film there is sometimes where they had tension but it was more like buddy banter that at times was hysterical to watch. Jon Benthal is good as Lee Iacocca and was the visionary at ford who kickstarted the idea that Ford needed to change its design and make them more like Ferrari but more importantly more like the future. Caitriona Balfe is great as Miles' wife and is his rock through the challenges he faces while being a  race car driver. Tracy Letts does great acting as Henry Ford ll. He plays a boss and he acts like a boss, at the start you don't warm up to him but you do overtime because you find out how important it is to him to honour his grand-father by revolutionising Ford's cars. Josh Lucas plays Leo Beebe with ease. His character isn't the nicest guy who doesn't like Miles which can be frustrating to watch, as he believes that Miles isn't a team player and shouldn't be the face of Ford. By not liking Beebe it shows Lucas' incredible acting. I believe that the film is a must-see for everyone with an incredible story, humour and heart.",

            "content": "4.5 Star Review: (No Spoilers here) Christian Bale steals the show once again as race car drive Ken Miles. Also starring Matt Damon as Carroll Shelby, Ford v Ferrari tells the true story of the legendary battle Ford waged against Ferrari at the 24 hr racetrack in Le Mans, France back in the 1960's. Directed by James Mangold (Walk the Line, Logan) the film focuses on the relationship of Ford engineer Carroll Shelby and his friend/trusted driver Ken Miles. With Ferrari dominating the 24 Hours at Le Mans year after year, Ford Motor Company had a desire to improve their reputation and image with the world and not be seen as a simple car manufacturer. Ford wanted to prove to the world they were just as capable of engineering a true sports car that could compete on the world stage with the best of the best. \nFighting against corporate rule, Shelby and Miles set out to prove to Ford and the world that they could win Le Mans with the new Ford GT40. Matt Damon does a great job playing as Carroll Shelby but it is Christian Bale as Ken Miles who is really the heart and soul of this film. Bale's portrayal of Miles as a brazen, yet highly knowledgeable and resourceful race car driver with a blue-collar work ethic makes you want to root for him every chance you get. Guided by Mangold's directing vision, the film takes the audience through a journey of engineering and design riddled with hard work, blood, sweat, sacrifice, failure and success that makes every race shown to be meaningful for what it took to get there. \nFord v Ferrari is a thrilling spectacle and one worth seeing for Christian Bale alone. Thankfully, however, there is a lot more the film has going for it to make even non-car enthusiasts feel the thrill and excitement of engineering and racing.",

As the daughter of a NASCAR fan who regularly shut herself in her room when a race was on, this film has shown me the error of my ways. It is unpretentious relative to the subject and allows for any fan of an underdog story to appreciate the narrative regardless of having background knowledge of racing. \n\nBale and Damon are wonderful, which comes as no surprise, and they are well balanced by talented supporting characters that hold their own next to these giants. These days, when watching new films, I often feel that I need to ask myself: why make a movie this white in 2019? Sometimes the answer is simple. Ford vs. Ferrari is a great story in the hands of the right people who happen to be white. Sometimes Oscar bait just works. Sometimes, Ryan Gosling teaches you about jazz while John Legend is sort of, just there? In 2020, I hope to see more Le Le Mans and less La La Land from white actors and directors.

Bruce Mclaren which drove for Ford, went on to create his world famous car company himself. Most importantly, Ford came back 50 years later to do the same thing! Incredible. It could of been a text across the screen right before credits just to get that information out to the masses. But overall it was good.

And with FvF, you get a little bit of everything. From the first shot you're in the hot seat, with engines rip roaring high and landscapes flying by. And before long we're introduced to the ensemble of characters that will dominate the screen, lacing the lights with emotion whilst at bay from the race track. Often in car films, it feels like a race to the next race, but with strong performances, a sprinkling of laughs, and these well written specific relationships, we're enmeshed in the world and not left wanting the next checkered flag. Bale is fun to watch; Damon is a natural fit; and Jupe, Lucas, Bernthal, Balfe and Letts (who proves a wonderful scene stealer) are the meat and potatoes to this tale of two. For a Hollywood flick, there's a lot to sink your teeth into, and I came out sure as hell wanting to jump into a Shelby and speed off into the sunset.",

His attention to detail, and love for his automobile, contrast is brash and gruff demeanor. Alongside, Matt Damon, a famous driver, turned coach, Carroll Shelby, they are the perfect team assembled to finally give Ford the dominance they want over Ferrari. Besides some unnecessary \"villainy\" from one of the Ford members, the movie runs fairly smoothly. It reach great heights and of joy, and plunders into even lower lows of grief. The race cars screech and squeal, and drive faster than any human should truly ever go in a machine that could, at any moment, burst into flame. It's exciting and heartwarming entertainment, about a real life story that needed to be told.",

The acting here is great with characters able to show rather than say a lot.  I know the awards season has so far showered the awards on the showy (read hammy as hell) work in the Irishman and Joker...but dollars for donuts four of the best performances by men this year are in this movie. (Bale, Damon in leads and Bernthal, Lusas in supporting roles).  And yes it is a little long...but still 4 1/2 out of 5 stars (and if you get the chance see it on the biggest loudest screen you can)\n\nAnd Darrin Prescot deserves some special oscar love for his work on this film",

The story the movie tells, and the acting make this movie my second favorite of the year, only to Joker. I honestly did not expect to enjoy a moving about racing as much as I did, much less cry during the movie. Caused by both the story itself, but more-so the amazing acting. Everyone stands out to be sure, and Matt Damon as always is truly a talent, and in this movie that is absolutely the case. Bastard made me cry. But this time, even more so than American Psycho or The Machinist, Christian Bale steals the entire movie by tricking you into believing he is the person, not just a character. If you enjoyed either of those, or The Martian, and don't care much for racing; I can pretty much guarantee you will enjoy this movie.",

            "content": "To start the title Ford v Ferrari is confusing!  The movie introduces Ferrari like an hour into the movie, not literally but in reality the movie title is the most misleading way to market to car enthusiasts.  Even though I don't follow racing, or even a car fanatic, just happened to see a documentary on the Lemans race between Ford and Ferrari. The movie title should be Ken Miles AUTO-bio, or Shelby/Miles v. Ford, or Henry Ford the 2nd dictator or Influencer... no the last one is a joke.\n\n3 ways this movie sucks:\n1) Completely disrespects the Ferrari brand and not telling how impressive the Ferrari race team was and how revolutionary their cars were.\n2) Completely missed on the most entertaining facts and storylines that make Ferrari Ford rivalry that last only what a decade, but still a 2hr 32min movie wasting so much time to make racing look beautiful, terrifying, but tried to captivate audience to actor's emotions.  I can't connect to their great actors when the movie slowly connects to Shelby's history and tries to mix in Ken Miles character without any introduction to how names Shelby & Miles have anything to do with Ford or Ferrari.  Even though movie scenes and action can look good if storyline is confusing or lacks context to connect to characters or WHY THE AUDIENCE SHOULD ROOT FOR THE ACTORS/CHARACTERS, then why try to film a beautiful movie or higher expensive actors.  I see why I haven't heard about the movie from street cred or great reviews popping up on social media, because all character are portrayed to have faults except the wife of Ken Miles.  Let me finish on how the storyline could have made shorter in a 2 hr movie, have simple timeline flashes to show importance of Lemans, how endurance racing races have a triple crown like horse racing and the crown of the 3 races: Daytona, Sebring, is Lemans.  Also, explain how Enzo ferarri was a racer like Shelby, and how Ferrari won 7 out of 8 years in arow 1958 -1965 with only Carroll Shelby beating Ferrari in 1959... not clearly shown in movie that Shelby beat Ferrari.  \n3) Don't waste time showing how great a woman Ken Miles wife is... the Ken Miles family connection great except nobody is really rooting for Miles because Miles aint American trying to represent Ford, he has no agenda to beat Ferrari, but he dies so lets make his death heart breaking, but spoiler his death isn't heart breaking with a Shelby voice over.  Shelby had stated in interviews that he felt he and Miles or his team had overcome Ford 2nd's incompetence or Ford's incompetence he blamed on Miles deathth, yet director or produces make it look like Miles introduced the honeycomb light weight design Ford made and Shelby blamed ford for his death.  To connect with the fears of racing show Enzo Ferrari's son Peiro whom was qouted by saying his dad told him not to get too close to driver of Ferrari racing because how many racers would die back then.  Show Ferrari's allence to italian driver over his own british driver, that could be a way to let audience find a better allegence to Christian Bale's character.\n\nMore time should have been spent on Ferrari being a brand to know and understand their greatness, then the rivalry lets you choose sides or stay independent and root for the driver's who just want to drive... but they would need to add another driver like John Surtees of England.  The movie shows how politics of Ford's flunkie's Leo Beebe didn't like english racer miles for driving Ford cars and how the 2 racing teams even different sizes and markets still have similar prejudices and dictatorships, while Shebly American racing inside of Ford is a more relatiable and rootable team of fun guys... yet none of these dynamics tie strong enough to the great actors.  Each actors character has an arc that falls flat by simply leaving out simple ties to the racing team style and culture \n\nShow how great the cars were just label them on screen so audience sees evolution of Ford car into GT40 Mark 2 into Mark 4 and Ferrari's 330P3 and its own beating of Mark 2 in '66 until the LeMans.\n\nYeah the long stuct movie timeline in 1965 was the wrong direction for this film, should have expanded from 58-65 introducing Shelby to Ferarri, Ford to Ferarri takeover, ford (American power) of",

            "content": "Ford vs. Ferrari is the true story of how legendary automaker Carrol Shelby and British racecar driver Ken Miles turned a stock Ford Mustang into a world class racing machine, and won the Le Mans 24-hour Grand Prix. It is also a wonderful character study, a stylish tribute to the golden age of the American automobile, and one of the year's best movies.\n\nThis is an incredibly stylish movie, from the gleaming racecars, to the slick business suits, to the rollicking sixties sound. It's brimming with confidence and ambition to match that of its central characters. It exudes a level of coolness rarely seen since the days of Paul Newman and Steve McQueen. Hell, it even brings a Mad Men level of mystique to the boardroom scenes and makes Jon Bernthal, the Punisher himself, look and sound like Don Draper. \n\nMore than that, this movie makes Matt Damon cool. Not just likable, or witty, but seriously cool. I mean of course they're going to cast Christian Bale as a high strung, quick tempered, prima-donna race car driver, but who would have thought to cast relatable, down to earth everyman Matt Damon as visionary, swaggering auto designer Carrol Shelby? I mean who knew he could even play a cowboy?\n\nSeriously though, Bale and Damon are absolutely perfect in their roles, and their chemistry is even better. I'm talking Newman and Redford level good. Whether they're discussing a mechanical problem or in the midst of a knockdown, drag out fight, they always play off of each other just right, Damon providing the slightly more reasonable and self-controlled ballast to Bale's loose cannon. It's a wonder that two men with such big egos can work together at all, but it's their dysfunctional yet earnest friendship that really drives this movie. (Pun intended)\n\nThis movie is of course just as much about rivalry as it is friendship. And I don't just mean the titular rivalry between companies. Enzo Ferrari and his top drivers make pretty good antagonists, and it's the desire to show them up that drives the whole story. Yet it's the rivalries within Ford- among top executives and between management and the drivers and engineers- that make things really interesting. With so much pride and competing visions at stake it's no surprise that things get pretty cutthroat, but at the end of the day most of these people still have to work with each other.\n\nMoreover, every conflict, every clash of personalities is handled with more thought and nuance than you would ever expect from a movie about car racing. One of the best examples of this movie's brilliance is the scene in which Shelby takes middle aged, overweight company president Henry Ford II for a spin around the track. Any other movie would have played this scene for laughs. This movie makes it poignant.\n\nAnd oh, are the racing scenes every magnificent. Heart pounding, suspenseful, and beautifully photographed, they're almost worth the price of admission on their even. The best parts almost place you in the driver's seat, so that you can practically feel the roar of the engines and the incredible speed. And the fiery crashes at Le Mans are as frightening as the best jump scares in a horror movie. Even if you've never watched a race and know nothing about the sport, you'll be on the edge of your seat.\n\nAll in all, this may be the best movie ever made about automobile racing- even better than Rush. I'll admit that leaving the theatre, it even made me want to take my old, falling apart 2004 Buick Park Avenue onto a long stretch of back road and open her up, just for a taste of speed. It's really that kind of movie.",

It\u2019s been a long, bad run for movies. Here\u2019s the cure. FvF is about Lee Iacocca\u2019s vision to change the perception of Ford in the late 60s which included having Caroll Shelby build a car that could win the 24 hours at LeMans and unseat Ferrari as the perennial champion. Shelby knew the only way that could happen was with his good friend Ken Miles at the wheel. The movie is the story of that friendship and the attempt to unseat the racing giant. This was just a fantastic movie. Damon and Bale were both amazing but honestly the whole cast was. Josh Lucas was an awesome slimeball. Beautifully filmed. Should get a cinematography nomination. No language. No nudity. No sex. Appropriate for pretty much any audience. One of the best of 2019 so far. 8.5/10, A- See in theater",

That was not the real story and by all accounts the real Leo Beebe was a very fine human being and a straight shooter,  not a corporate slime ball that the film makes him out to be.   He, indeed,  was the one who engineered the finish that robbed Ken Miles of a win, but he did not do so to maliciously rob Ken.  In fact once he discovered that that was the outcome, he was very sorry.   But despite some of the creative license, the movie works well and is exceptionally entertaining.",

The movie is a little long, and very loud, but a great story. I would watch it a second time to catch what I missed the first time around.",

This movie we done so well that it sparks intrigue into the characters and if you didn't know them before, you will be googling them after the movie because you want to know more about racing, Le Mans, and also Ford Corp of the 1960's.  No, it's not exactly historically accurate but it's not a documentary either. The acting was A plus, Matt Damon transformed himself into Carrol Shelby to portray the man as he was. The best however was Christian Bale as Ken Miles, if you knew of Ken, Bale took the shape and over the top rugged Brit that makes you smile and love  the character so much that the ending makes you understand the loss that Shelby felt. If you had reservations to see this and not a car buff, go against them and sit down for this 2 1/2 hour hit that you will get lost in.",

Jon Bernthal steals some of the show in his gritty performance as a young Lee Iacocca, and Caitriona Balfe (Mollie Miles) delivers an impressive turn as Miles' supportive, unflappable wife. It's an extremely watchable film from beginning to end. The racing scenes are what they should be--tense, dangerous, fast. Though exciting, there is a kind of deliberate, understated plodding feel to much of the film. That's not a bad thing. It's a bit bloated at two and a half hours, but it does not drag. Some of the characters felt a little trope-y or wooden, but since all we really care about are Shelby and Miles, that can be forgiven. It's a wonderful story with a superb cast and truly an enjoyable film.",
