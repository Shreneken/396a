            "content": "Esta tercera pel铆cula de Black Christmas que tiene un mont贸n de cosas en su contra. De lo positivo solo se puede rescatar el suspenso, la ambientaci贸n, la producci贸n y la fotograf铆a. Todo lo dem谩s falla porque se trata de una pel铆cula diferente que solo toma el t铆tulo de la pel铆cula original, algunas referencias y tenga de protagonistas a universitarias como en la pel铆cula original. Todo lo dem谩s recae en una pel铆cula feminista con protagonistas muy desagrables que llegan a hacer que uno las termine odiando. Los antagonistas aqu铆 son j贸venes que tienen una muy justa raz贸n para hacer lo que hacen. Eso es un punto a favor de la pel铆cula, ya que los antagonistas dicen cosas sobre las mujeres que son ciertas y que justifican muy bien porque el feminismo es algo realmente venenoso. El principal objetivo del film es plantear la violencia contra la mujer, pero lo hace de una manera muy poco cre铆ble, al punto que uno se pone del lado de los antagonistas. Otra de las grandes fallas de esta pel铆cula es estar orientada a los menores de 13 a帽os porque eso no se puede hacer en un slasher. Las escenas de muerte y la violencia se sienten muy censuradas, lo cual hacen que esta pel铆cula falle como slasher. Esta tercera entrega de Black Christmas es sin duda la peor de la saga, uno de los peores reinicios y una de las peores pel铆culas feministas en la historia. Mi calificaci贸n final para esta pel铆cula es un 4/10.",

I always find this issue interesting when it's touched on and executed in the right way, which for the most part that side of it is. But coming back to the unpopular cousin bit, the characters and story stuff is, for the most part, pretty lazy. Saying that though, because the overall concept was as crazy as it was it, actually made for a fun watch. But please, if you want to watch a well crafted movie that touches on drinking, the abuse of woman, and the ignorance of society, watch ‘Promising Young Woman' it's done ALOT better.\n\nAdditional: Damn the girl's ‘Ho ho ho' song is catchy, I think it's going to be in my head for days... or weeks... or just forever.......",

            "content": "OK,........ what the hell did I just watch?\n\nI'm a fan of the 2006 remake of black Christmas and recently found out there was a 2019 release remake, my god I was disappointed. Black Christmas, both the 1974 and the 2006 movies where slasher movies that took a Christmasy slant on the formula of the slasher genre, and knowing this, I went into this movie with certain expectations\n\nWhat I was met with was contrived, obvious, and awful. Whereas previous titles with the black Christmas title focused on the typical formula, introducing the character, then introducing the killer, followed by the arrival of the killer, and then chaos ensues, in this instance, the movie mainly follows a single character, who was the victim of a sexual assault, rather obviously but no one believes her.\n\nThis at this point then gets busy making the point, alpha douchbags are bad. well no kidding, right. after this there is a performance where out ........heroine??? comes across a strange ritual in the frat house of the evil guys (I wonder if this is going to be supernatural?????)\n\nThe girls then do some sort of a dance number at a \"student got talent\" kind of event, pushing again that the rapist douchbag is a rapist douchbag, then leave. From this point, they start picking the girls off from the girls' frat house, all off-screen. (Yup, the movie with the tie to a slasher movie by name recognition, has all it's kills off-screen) from here, the movie starts to try to build tension and fails because of its predictability, and tries to keep some link to a slasher horror and fails by keeping all it's kills off-screen.\n\nThis leads to the typical buildup to the final attack where our 'heroines?' home is invaded by a hooded figure, after a short struggle and one of the girls being killed, they stop the killer and before they can unmask him, another rises to take his place, there's more of them *edit in the overly dramatic hamster here*.\n\nThis leads to the discovery that the girls' frat isn't the only girls' frat being targeted. and this has the big \"I thought you were a fighter\" moment where the weak main character chooses to fight and the previously strong character wants to run away. This leads to the final showdown where the plot basically boils down to \"awful professor is an awful person, the frat is using a dark magic ritual to control new pledges minds\" then the strong character makes her triumphant return and the final battle insues, where the item controlling the men is destroyed.\n\nNow the biggest error of the movie, while it's established that the rapey douchbag is a douchbag in this scene, it is also said that the guys in charge of the frat are evil, whereas the pledges are brainwashed and being controlled by the evil professor and the douchbags, so when the idol of the magic ritual is destroyed, half the guys in the room collapse, and the potential love interest of the main 'heroine?' are returned their own minds. \n\nAt this point, the room catches fire, and the women and the love interest escape, barring the door behind them, giving a final shot of the female 'heroine' smiling as the building burns............wait, didn't we just establish that the frats where being brainwashed by black magic???? so even the rapey douchbag and the assholes who deserved to die, why did the brainwashed pledges deserve to die?\n\nAviod this movie, it's the Christmas season and I am one of the many people who will watch Christmas set movies at this time of year, but if you want my recommendation for movies that fit the season without the Christmas cheer of a typical Christmas movie, you can choose from either of the other 2 black Christmas movies, batman returns, gremlins, santa slays and of course, Die Hard and Die Hard 2",

I am a woman and I love horror films, I don't want to watch annoying women yell at me. Just because I am a woman does NOT mean I need a movie to have a feminist message. I guess the director of this movie does not think women can enjoy a normal horror film.\nWomen in this movie are whiney and not open to hearing the opinions of others. They are weak and complain all the time. They slander/harass men and then are surprised when the men are angry about it. The women demand respect without giving any respect. I am ashamed to be the same gender as these female characters. The goal of the movie was female empowerment, but it had the opposite effect. I actually started rooting for the men because the female characters were basic, loud, and obnoxious. In the ending scene, when all the boys stopped being possessed and stopped attacking the woman, the \"heroes\" of the movie still killed them. \nIf you have a message, why alienate half of the horror lover demographic? This movie tells men that they are all evil, sexist demons, no matter how kind or considerate they are. I guess it's bad to generalize women but it is okay to generalize men. Why would men want to see this movie if the goal is to yell at and criticize them? And how do you expect men to change and listen to a message if the movie people say that men won't understand it because it was not made for them? I already know that woman are mistreated and that some men are sexist. I don't need a movie to tell or show me this. The director and writer must think that I am stupid. What is the point of this movie, besides being a cash grab?\nI AM A WOMAN AND I HATED THIS FILM. YOU CAN'T USE THE \"I AM A MAN\" EXCUSE. I give this movie a zero in terms of horror and negative 100 in terms of feminism. I am deeply ashamed of this movie. It was a boring cash grab marketed as a feminist horror film.

Algo que no tendría porque serlo pero dado la gran carga de mensaje politico y social que hay en ella, algo así era inevitable.\n\nEmpezar diciendo que precisamente no tengo en absoluto un problema con dicho mensaje, de hecho, estoy más que a favor y precisamente la original del 75 tenia ideas mas que similares...salvo que mucho mejor expresadas y mucho más valientes en el contexto de la época... Curiosamente, lo que para algunos en esta cinta es algo metido con la sutileza de un elefante en una cacharrería, a mi me parece que refleja bastante bien la realidad social en la que vivimos.\n\nUna vez dicho esto...la película es mala. Ni siquiera el excelente trabajo de Imogen Poots (y algunas de sus compañeras de reparto), que sostiene casi por si sola la película es suficiente para arreglar el desastre en lo demás. El guión es pobretón y simplón, salvando algunos elementos que podrían verse como inteligente reflejos (y ataques) a la cultura más machista e incel. \n\nEl trabajo de cámara en combinación con la edición es desastroso. No solo tenemos planos faltos de expresividad (o directamente mal encuadrados), sino que restan de toda tensión posible en la cinta. De hecho, el único momento en el que vi algun retazo de creatividad visual, es un \"homenaje\" al Exorcista III. No tengo problemas con que sea un calco, hemos visto cosas similares antes y entiendo el guiño, pero dice poco de tu película que el momenta más interesante a nivel estíslitico esté sacado de otra cinta.\n\nCierto cambos en la trama intentaban hacer algo diferente a la original al mismo tiempo que servir de una graciosa anología paródica a compartamientos sociales poco encomiables actuales...sin embargo acaban jugando en contra de la cinta, haciéndola mucho más tontorrona, menos creible, y además casi contradice parte del mensaje que quieres mandar...\n\nEntiendo también que la película tuvo bastante problemas a nivel de producción y mucha mano de estudio detrás, lo cual no ayudó para nada...Aun así...horriblemente fallida, lo que me da mucha pena.",

Characters are cliche and dumb. The acting is meh. The plot and concept about a sorority girls are being stalked and killed by a frat boy. Which i will not give away spoilers to the twist and concept the film is playing with like a conspiracy cult kind of thing. The concept does mess with the idea of feminism and assault. Which noone believes the victim. Imogen Poots is a beautiful actress. But her character is bad and cliche. The cast is decent but the performances are terrible. The direction lacks the scares and thrills. This film does cut away the gory kills. The twist is campy which tries to be fun. But it fails with its boring direction.

There is not a single ounce of subtlety in this entire film when it comes to the message of \"We are strong woman and men all are monsters\", and Im all for women being treated as well as men do, I'm all for female empowerment. But by alienating an entire sex takes away the humanity and realism of the message they're beating you over the head with this entire movie. Rather than be an engaging rated R horror movie it's just a preachy trying to be woke and politically correct message turned into a film. Worst part is nothing clever or interesting is made to this so it can't be labeled a satire or a relevant ahead of its time kind of thing. There's no subtly, no thought, no clever writing, no real humanity and it's not so bad it's good meaning it has little to no rewatch value. It's annoying it's pretentiously preachy, it's a Christmas I want to forget.",

There was hardly any horror, most of the time the camera cut away from anything that even hinted at horror - I'm assuming it had a PG rating.\n\nThe acting and direction were uniformly terrible and the lazy special effects, which basically consisted of black blood and people in hoods walking around in slow motion, also terrible. \n\nJust terrible. Everything, terrible terrible terrible. \n\nThe production cost must have been low because the movie looked really cheap and nasty. Like a college film made with good intentions but sadly failing.\n\nMy wife and I watched it to the end, and I must admit, it became so ridiculously awful and cartoonish that we did get a chuckle or two out of it. If you can, stick around for the final battle - it really is something.\n\nLastly - Please follow this simple rule. No politics in film, unless your film is about politics.",

From start to finish, every single character choice, plot-point or development serves only one purpose - to say that misogyny is bad. There are no characters - just placeholders for various degrees of patriarchy and feminism. Too many times a modern movie has been accused of being ''woke'', but this one truly is. It takes it's righteous fight against misogyny into levels of absurdity and offers no redeeming qualities for it's male characters. The most frustrating thing is that this particular story could serve as a platform of giving young women their voice and agency against oppression. However, this film is so misguided and aggressive that it doesn't allow any deep dwelling on it's, otherwise good, message.",

This film is just a massive mess, not only is it poorly written and acted but sadly unlike 'the room' this film is extremely boring meaning there is literally no room for even 1% if enjoyment. Iv tried my best in this review to explain how bad this film is but sadly it really isnt enough, not that many people will see this film but if you are going to see it for your own good just dont. If you have any intelligence dont see it, it will kill your brain cells. Finally my question to who ever wrote this film, what the hell was you on when you wrote this? Seriously you need help as does anyone that read the script and went yes let's get involved.",

Sophia Takal directs with a deft cinematic hand, motivating a lot of her shots with interesting camera movements and creepy background elements that leave the film a solid cut above your usual horror flick. Its opening sequence alone nabs your attention with a pretty brilliant use of a snow angel's imagery. The build-up is slow and dreadful, taking a good amount of time to set up its world and characters while dropping a head-scratching trail of crumbs that'll make you think \"no way, is the movie really going there?\" Oh, HELL YEAH, IT DOES.\nOnce the admittedly limited thrills start to bleed out, 'Black Christmas' turns into a glorious cartoon about my, ahem, favorite pair of words in the English language: toxic masculinity. Up until around the movie's halfway mark, Takal and April Wolfe's screenplay holds up okay, with only the occasionally grating super-uber-mega-duper \"smash the patriarchy\" remark trickling out from Aleyse Shannon's plain awfully written character, Kris. If her degree of unabashed \"wokeness\" wasn't enough by then, when the spookiness and ridiculously nutty plot reveals start to hit, the movie's true narrative awakens and turns the piece into the purest, most splendorous schlock I've had the pleasure of experiencing in 2019. Neither 'Hellboy,' nor 'Serenity' can match the insane wonders here afoot, no sir.",

            "content": "Truthfully, not as bad as I thought it was going to be. And to be totally honest not really a bad movie. The second remake now of Black Christmas (1974) a film that some may say started the slasher film genre. This film keeps with the theme of strong woman protagonists and characters that aren't the typical kind of characters you find in these kind of movies, but it definitely takes a sharp left during its third act. It's Christmas time at Hawthorne College, so that means everyone is going on Winter Break for the end of the Fall Semester. We follow Riley (Imogen Poots) who is staying behind with her fellow sisters Kris (Aleyse Shannon), Marty (Lily Donoghue) and Jesse (Brittany O'Grady). Riley is an orphan, so her sorority is really all she has. Riley herself had a traumatic experience involving the local AKO Fraternity President Brian  (Ryan McIntyre). The girls decide to play a prank on the fraternity and soon after begin receiving very disturbing text messages. Girls in the nearby sororities start to be picked off by a masked killer one by one. The killer eventually finds himself at Rileys sorority and gives them a night they soon won't forget. There's actually quite a bit more plot to this, but I don't want to ruin it. The film works a lot because Poots is really good here. She's very likeable and is resourceful. I enjoyed her and while I think the plot is ridiculous (especially when you find out some secrets revealed) I still think it's one of those horror films that knows it's cheesy and you kind of just go with it. It's predictable and at times very campy, but it works. It definitely went a different direction than the original and for this kind of movie it works. I think the movie would have benefited by staying with a R rating. The PG-13 rating here really takes away from the kills (often times a lot of it happening off screen). For the most part I would say horror fans should give this one a rental at the very least when it releases for home release.",

When a slasher begins knocking off her sorority sisters, she has to unravel an ancient mystery to discover what is the true evil force behind killings.\n\nThe positive aspects of the film is that it's definitely not boring. We'll get to that later. Director Sophia Takal does use some creative shots to try to create some tension and there is a part of the film where it's genuinely unpredictable. There is also an admirable spotlight shined on the dangers of date rape on college campuses.\n\nIt's main problem is that \"Black Christmas\" just isn't very scary.\n\nPerhaps its the PG-13 rating to try to lure in a younger audience, but I was never really worried nervous for the entirety of the film. Yes, I wanted to see how it ended but I wasn't invested. Many of the characters were hard to like and there is a twist down the homestretch that is bound to divide audiences.\n\nAll in all, it's a film with something to say, it just has little interest in trying to cement it's legacy as a frightening holiday slasher.",

Ending was good but too abrupt and didn't show any aftermath so it felt incomplete. Overall it just felt like a made for TV movie rather than an actual movie with a release you'd have to pay for since it all just felt cheap. Wait for it to be on Netflix.

These were promptly abandoned when, in the second half, the sorority girls took to extreme combat with mysterious hooded figures.  The gruesome fates that befell numerous sisters unfortunately fell flat with the audience, as the lack of character development made it too easy to say goodbye to these girls.\nBetter characterization was the second thing that this movie needed.  Beyond the main trio - who stood out only due to the quantity of lines, not the quality - it was difficult to recognize individual characters because there was no development.  Not a single character showed any sort of dimensionality or growth throughout the movie.\nThe third component that this movie sorely lacked was a well-written script.  Stereotypical and uninspired, the lines in this movie made it more reminiscent of a comedy than the horror film it so clearly wanted to be.  At the most suspenseful and dramatic moments, the sheer silliness of the dialogue cut through all tension. Lastly, the cinematography was flat, uninteresting, and at times so cliché it added to the comedic atmosphere created by the poor writing.

            "content": "Whilst the film was advertised as being a freshly done take on the 1974 original film of the same name by Bob Clark, it largely strays away from the original source material. In fact, it entirely deviates from the concept of Black Christmas. It is important to note that while there are subtle hints of disdain with the dominance of classic patriarchal archetypes in the 1974 film, the focus of the film was entirely a horror piece, intended to evoke unease and shock in its audience. The 2019 film completely throws the concept of its source to the side and trades it in for a surprisingly cringeworthy attempt at showcasing the horrors of \"toxic masculinity\". The film begins as a slow-burn style slasher, even recreating certain shots of the original film, only occasionally peppering the viewer with meta-commentary on the social injustices a patriarchal society inflicts upon women today. As the film progresses, it phones-in more of a socio-political commentary more akin to the television series 'Scream Queens', with its sub-focus revolving around feminism and empowering women rather than comedy. I have nothing wrong with feminist concepts and female empowerment in films or even horror films...If it is done correctly and tastefully, it needs to be nuanced and done with subtlety. Black Christmas (2019) is a cringey and contrived attempt at establishing a feminist's \"f*ck the man\" film in modern horror. This movie used the beloved title of 'Black Christmas' as a catchy brand, just to push a narrative about gender politics. Other than their settings, the 2019 film bears no similarity to the original film or even the 2005 remake and is only 'Black Christmas' in its name. A lot of concepts and ideas are taken very far in this film and it falls entirely beyond the scope of horror that the original Christmas time slasher-film brought to the table. At its core, it serves to become yet another classic IP being tarnished and assimilated by a blindly aggressive feminist agenda in cinema.",

            "content": "The good thing about going to a movie in the waning weeks of December is you can declare, “I just saw the best/worst film of the year.” So how much better to go towards the end of the decade when you can justifiably proclaim, “I just saw the worst movie of the decade!” Indeed. Black Christmas, 92 minutes of horror released 12/13, Friday the 13th. It’s winter break eve at Hawthorne College. Think East Coast, Ivy League. Gothic, gargoyles, stones and spires. The traditional holiday follies are underway! A chorus line of MKE sorority sisters take the stage and sing a parody set to “Up on the Housetop” that’s directed at former president and (respected) rapist of the AKO fraternity who is smirking from the back of the packed room. This #MeToo performance sends AKO—aka ghoulish underworld black magic fratboys into a murderous revenge rage fueled by a supernatural, sticky tar gunk that seeps out of the bust of college founder, Calvin Hawthorne, a known racist, sexist and misogynist. Hunker down, the hunt is on! Apparently Ivy League colleges now teach archery along with the classics because the depraved, rampaging fratbrats are armed with none other than bows and arrows to kill their feminist prey. Trinkets that identify each targeted woman are stolen by a treasonous, back-stabbing (literally) sorority sister and used to track down the #MeToo crew. Missing a hair clip? Watch out! An arrow is whizzing your way. Robin Hood would be repulsed. There are a few weapon substitutes such as extra-pointy icicles snapped off snowy eaves and attic-stashed Christmas lights, those vintage, extra large red and green bulbous strings—that never work—so the better to choke you with, my dear! The Brothers Grimm would be proud. If you’re curious about the PG-13 rating, unusual for a slasher/horror movie, the kills are blood-free. The ladies get bonked or impaled or gashed Disney-style, resulting in artsy, palatable gore, sans splatter. The bad boys don’t even have blood, just busty black goo ooze, “This can’t be real,” says one brassy coed examining a dead diablo boy. How perceptive. The ghost of bad Calvin Hawthorne, condensed into coal dust from landing one too many years on Santa’s naughty list, mucks amok. Eventually the story shifts from women-as-victims to women-as-attackers. But not before they turn on each other, taking a respite from arrows and axes and knives to argue and bicker. Picture this, you and your BFF, nearly slasher fodder, escape by commandeering a car and are racing for your lives down a dark, isolated wintery road. But mean looks are exchanged, harsh words levied and feelings are hurt, so naturally it makes perfect sense to stop and refuse to ride any farther together. Separate. Stomp off. Now one of you must walk for your life. Oh, please. Da-dum-dum-dum, dum, dumb. Her foolish move drags Little Drummer Boy into the fray. Don’t worry. The disgruntled walker survives, appearing in the next scene slogging menacingly towards the AKO voodoo brothers with a snow shovel slung over her shoulder, the weapon du jour. Visualize a shovel-toting Annie Oakley in a Santa cap. Hard to imagine....unless you’ve seen Black Christmas. The film ends with the sisterhood unified in fiery defiance. Let the slings and arrows fly. I won’t spoil it by saying anything more. Well, maybe just one more thing. Skip it. ",

Feels like it was re-edited like it would play on cable TV, with the gore and action reduced to frames of incomprehensibility. Also, the story is so heavy-handed and lacking in nuance and gray areas. The sexes are reduced to extremes, for the majority of the characters, and it really starts to feel like a cartoonish mess. These women deserve their revenge, by all means, but adding in a supernatural element for the men doing what they’re doing, removes all responsibility from them being held accountable for their actions. “The devil made me do it” aspect really is a huge disservice to what could’ve been an excellent opportunity to show how dangerous humans can be in reality, without the mysticism being added in for heightened drama.",

            "content": "Wow, this, the second attempt at a Black Christmas remake, is a misguidedly bad film.\n\nThis movie carries a heavy pro-women, anti-misogyny/patriarchal-control-of-the-system (particularly in the college environment) vibe to the whole thing. Let me make it clear that I support the message, it's the way it's executed that I have a problem with. You ever went to an original college play because of a class or to support a friend, and it feels like it's trying to be deep about something, but you can't stand it? This is that movie in a nutshell. (In the director/co-screenwriter and other co-screenwriter's defense, this film had a pretty short production schedule. Not saying the movie would've been better necessarily, just saying.)\n\nThe movie beats you over the head with the message. Plot and dialogue comes in second, less than second. The characters are extremely frustrating as they act and talk in a way that isn't plausible at all. A lot of them aren't people, just talking points. There are a lot of one-dimensional misogynists in this film who say nothing but the most obvious and basic chauvinistic lines. It gets really painful. Also, the killer's or killers' plan has so many loopholes.\nI know that horror movies often require a suspension of disbelief but even this sinks way below an accordingly low bar.\n\nYou can see where the plot is going pretty early on, which makes waiting through the slow-paced first two thirds of the film a pain.\n\nIn the brief moments where people aren't speaking for or against the equality of women, there are a few lines that could've been funny, but none of the cast makes the dialogue work, especially Brittany Grady, who is supposed to be comic relief. Veteran actor Cary Elwes is in this and even he gives a terrible performance.\n\nAs for the actual horror in this, there are a few good weapon ideas but there isn't enough to salvage the film. The movie was originally R-rated but got cut down to PG-13 which hurt it. I'm not one of those \"R-rated horror movies only\" guys, but the problem is that the editor clearly just ended a couple kills abruptly. There was no attempt to reshoot or reedit scenes to make them run smoothly. If you like horror but not rape in your horror be forewarned that this movie will get uncomfortable.\n\nTo the movie's credit, the cinematography is good. There are a few post-kill shots that are effective. The one major thing this movie has in common with the original is that it goes with this stark reality look to it. There is an effectively cold feel to the whole thing. The campus and surrounding houses look like a real college environment.\n\nI'd say this is about as bad as the last Black Christmas remake just in a different way. You want to see a Christmas-themed horror film? I suggest the original or Krampus.",

            "content": "Black Christmas is a 2019 Holiday Slasher film directed by Sophia Takal and written by Takal and April Wolfe. It’s the third remake of the original 1974 film of the same name but is a fundamentally different movie in a lot of ways. It has a more fast paced style and a completely different story it’s trying to tell. Only a few things tie the three films together, the Christmas theme and the fact that it takes place in a sorority house where people get murdered. The film was written and shot with an R rating in mind but was changed after test screenings to be PG-13, and it shows. A lot of the kill scenes are cut abruptly short in a way that’s extremely distracting taking away from the film makers intended vision. Slasher films don’t need to be gory to work, Halloween (1978) and the original Black Christmas are great examples of that, but when a film is re-edited to become something that it’s not it because of committee think (cough cough Blumhouse), it comes off cynical and ruins the impact the creators wanted it to have. The writing of this film is completely bonkers, it goes to places that border on schlock and come off comical, which I wasn’t expecting due to the serious subject matter. It takes on rape culture in fraternities and toxic masculinity in general which is a real issue that can fit well into a horror movie like this, but it was handled so broadly to the point where it felt like a parody of itself. One thing I really liked about the film was the way it looked; some of the later scenes are bathed in green or red as Christmas lights illuminate character’s faces and the environment, and it looked great. There we’re probably some good things in there, but its buried by re-edits and a ridiculous plot that doesn’t take its subject matter as seriously as it should. Imogen Poots is great as always and does her best to keep this movie afloat along with the pretty cinematography, but sadly, it’s just another remake.",

In fact it comes off a bit racist among other things. Minor spoilers ahead so be warned.\n\nBasically the movie is about an evil male fraternity that solely exists to perpetuate the patriarchy and subdue women. They do this through the ritualistic hunting of women who will not conform to their sexist ideals. The goal is to take over places of power and law to wright the civilized world into a mans world. They outright say that women are supposed to be 2nd to men, and even attempt to get the protagonist to bow to their might. Obviously they picked the wrong Sorority (plural by the end because the survivors fight back). While they were outclassed only moments ago, the plot demands that they overpower the magically juiced up frat bros and end their evil by killing them all with fire.\n\nNow I do like that the insufferable frat bros got roasted (literally) because they are indeed jerks. The film makes it clear that their alumni are the people who drug and rape women (they did this to Riley and attempt this on another girl in the film). Nothing is shown but it was still a hard watch for me, because I was molested repeatedly (at age 12). It never really goes away, you just manage it. The film does capture that, and in the end when she turns the tables and symbolically conquers her trauma was very powerful. It is a shame that the rest of the film mires that moment with poorly written activism. \n\nThe male fraternity is a stand in for the patriarchy, and by extension men in general. You see the founders black magic calls to the \"inner alpha\" within men, taking control of them and making them \"as they were meant to be\" as stated (paraphrased) in the film. This extends to any man, even those not who are not in the Frat which makes it more than just the patriarchy as an establishment. This reinforces the idea that all men are violent and by association sex crazed rapists/ enablers at their core with little regard to the agency of Women. That there is some sort of active kabal that gets together to oppress women, and all men are participants. This even includes Caleb Eberhardt's character. Now if this quality is innate to all men then minority men at their core are also violent rapists (sounds like a certain elected official). In essence this reinforces the violent minority Boogyman myth because again, that is at the core of all men. \n\n\nIt feels like this is a trend, especially with male black actors. It isn't enough to be snubbed for any meaningful role, they also need to be thoroughly humiliated by films end. Caleb plays the role of a somewhat nerdy guy with a crush on Riley who is repeatedly made to enter embarrassing situations and apologies way too much being meek through most of the film. His primary quality is being a kiss ass that comes off as manipulative and even creepy. I've seen it time and time again which is disappointing and an irony. You would think with all this activism that kind of writing would be ousted. \n\nI would also like to say that you can't fix a stab wound by stabbing yourself with the same knife on another part of your body. You cannot fix the problems by adopting the same fundamental ethos that lead to the problem in the first place. Black Christmas falls into this trap like many other films before it. \n\nInstead of making a meaningful commentary on gender disparity BC is yet another movie where the Women are not elevated by their own merits (barring one), but by how awful their foe is made to be and it's a shame.",

I dont believe this should've been called Black Christmas, and I can see why they did what they did(to make it new and fresh by instead of remaking the same thing for the third time they changed the plot significantly to update it for modern times). The way it was shot made it feel like it would've fit right into the 1970s or even 80s. The first few jump scares were crafted and executed well. What keeps this movie from being great was the constant cut scenes when someone was murdered, and the rushed finale. Actresses all did fine, no one really stood out besides Imogen Poots who's usually reliable. Overall, the movie could've easily benefited from an R rating and should've been a tad longer and explored more of the endings twist.",

            "content": "Black Christmas, I mean, Sexism: A Christmas Movement is Blumhouse's latest bus fire monstrosity to hit the big screen. After seeing just about the entire film in the incredibly spoilerific trailer, I pretty much knew what type of film I was going into. I walked in with little to no expectations, and I gotta say this is one of the best comedy's I've seen so far this year. If I'm being sarcastic. There's really nothing good in this film and I mean that. I'm writing this review hours after seeing the film to soak it all in and try to find anything good, there isn't anything. \n\nThe acting in this movie, wasn't really the greatest. Every white man in the movie is just a racist, sexist, evil monster because I guess all white men including myself are just that. When I tell you this movie has nothing to do with Black Christmas, I mean it. There is absolutely nothing in this film that tells me this is a Black Christmas movie. Director and writer Sophia Takal in all of her brilliance has gone out and made an hour and a half movie about how evil men are and we rule the world. Women are inferior to us and they always will be. We must eliminate all women so man can rule over all. We can rape women and the police will listen to us when we say we didn't do it because they're a bunch of pigs too. This. Movie. Is. The. Most. Sexist. Liberal. SJW. Movie. Of. 2019. I sat there laughing at this cringe worthy dialogue like when one of the men has a woman in a choke hold, \"It's your body, your choice right?\" Like really? You had to bring abortion into a horror film? For what reason? This movie's dialogue doesn't even seem like it was real dialogue written for a script. It felt like someone just said, deliver whatever SJW man hating lines you want and for some reason the male actors did this too? To anyone reading this review thinking I'm a white man who's triggered, that's not the case. I'm angered and insulted by this films choice to be a movie like this. Not only does this have nothing to do with Black Christmas aside from the fact that this white male cult uses some black magic nonsense that makes literally no sense. It's the fact that in this movie white men are portrayed as I stated earlier as sexist, racist, evil monsters. One more thing about this movie and sexist/racist stuff, of course the one man on the women's side is a black male because, ALL WHITE MEN ARE EEEVVVIIILLLL. Stuff like that, along with in some films women being portrayed as sex objects the whole time, or black people being portrayed as trashy thug like figures, that sexist and racist nonsense shouldn't be allowed in Hollywood scripts. Keep that stuff in politics and out of film. Movies should be an escape from real world issues like this, not pushing these agenda's into the script to nod at a certain demographic. Beyond all of what I just said, this film is poorly edited, there's a hilarious concert like sequence (also shaming men), a very stupid plot twist at the end involving one of the girls, the teacher is of course the cult leader (it's in the trailer so it's not a spoiler), it's not scary even in the slightest, I didn't care about a single character, the music was terrible, the song choices were even worse, and of course the movie ends with our main characters escaping from the burning building. That seems to have become the norm in Blumhouse movies, the antagonist(s) just burn to death as the characters watch the house burn down and then the movie abruptly ends. Not to mention this movies actual attempts at humor fall flat at every single turn. \n\nI have to say a big congratulations to Hellboy. That film has been dethroned by this one for the worst film of 2019 crown. This was one of the worst films of the decade if I'm being brutally honest. It fails on every single level with really no redeemable qualities and for that reason Black Christmas, get's a big fat F",
