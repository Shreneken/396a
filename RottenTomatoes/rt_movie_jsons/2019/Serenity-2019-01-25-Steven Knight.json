Do you actually think that Steven Knight, who has made such great films as Dirty Pretty Things and Locke, doesn't know what he's doing? \nA very sparse minority of critics understand that before we \"criticize\" anything about this film, we need to consider the person who wrote the story. If you have half a brain, you'll get that.\nI'm not saying that Serenity is a masterpiece. It's not. It has its flaws. Anne Hathaway's character is inconsistent, and Diane Lane's character is totally unnecessary. But it's still a bold and clever film, and it deserves credit for pulling off something that is pretty damn ludicrous.\nViewers, ignore the critics and just go for the ride. It's well worth it.",

For almost the first act I was under the impression I was the victim of a bait-and-switch as the story shown during the previews (you know, Anne Hathaway trying to hire Matthew McConaughey to kill her abusive husband), was nowhere to be found. No, the entire first act subjects us to watch Matthew McConaughey miss out a few times on the big fish he's trying to catch, while simultaneously sleeping with Diane Lane. Almost to the point of feeling scammed, the story finally does pick up where it promised it would lead us. And in doing so, especially with the \"big twist\" in the script, this managed to pinch out one big, steamy pile of dog crap. The twist was completely out of left field and totally lame. I'm very disappointed in both Anne Hathaway and Matthew McConaughey as they're both Oscar winners and better than this. I wouldn't even advise a viewing of this when it comes to streaming or HBO.

Whether you like or dislike this movie seems to hinge on the BONKERS twist, which is what drew me to the film in the first place (other than writer/director Steven Knight, one of the most A-list casts of the year, and the intriguing premise). Everyone seems to say this is the worst movie of the year, but everyone refuses to give me a SINGLE reason why! The twist is exhilarating, it brings up an existentialism amongst the characters and a tech-based nightmare to rival Black Mirror! I can relate to this twist, because I and many others try to do this one way or another. To explain, I must go into spoilers. People who play videogames get curious where the limits lie, and will test them to see if they can change who lives and who dies and whatever else they can possibly unnaturally change. This core desire is at the heart of the movie. Granted, there are plotholes, but I'm glad this feeling is represented in film in a way that's utterly original. 8.5/10",

This obnoxious, abusive husband is also making their son's life a living hell.  \n\nPerhaps Anne Hathaway's character realizes that the police have ways of taking care of things they really want taken care of, but so frequently and enduringly fail the abused, vulnerable, etc., which in a perfect world should be of primary concern - be it men, women or children. In her instance in a marriage with a wealthy or powerful, sorry excuse for a man, (shall we immediately investigate what caused him to be such a loser, rather than protect the victims?) how from that vantage point, being up against someone of means or power, law enforcement may appear to be a bad joke, even though based on experience they have many little games they play to give the appearance of assistance, but are actually perpetrating, and most interested in raising quick revenues, being on the side where the best opportunity for video opts exist, and other apparent priorities that shall remain unmentioned on this review.

Whatever the creators were thinking will only seem clear to those who think because something is \u2018different' it must be good \u2013 while sometimes this can be so, it's not in this case. Here is an example of trying too hard to be \u2018different' and ending up simplistically off-the-wall, but not in a good way. \n\nWriter Stephen Knight won the day with \u2018Amazing Grace' 06, and seemed to perhaps be thinking he can blend some of the grand philosophy that graced that film into this concoction. Problem here is, the grotesque characters and situations are manipulatively designed to be so overly nasty as to make the viewer want to see the \u2018baddy' violently done in. That is never a good way to set up a convincing story but is very much a popular computer games scenario.  \n\nThis swear, booze and sex-fest wears thin very early on with its obvious attempt at outlandish  \u2018smart' pretence \u2013 it may have been halfway interesting if they had played it straight - as it appeared to be at the outset. Initially looking much like a remake of the Hemmingway/Garfield 50s noir classic \"The Breaking Point' - it soon veers off-course into the now predictable land of Computer Game \u2018magic'. It's also unbecoming for mixing perverse situations involving an abused minor into a rather lame fantasy element. Some audiences will only see the supposed \u2018cleverness', while others will see straight through it!  (as the box-office returns tend to confirm)\n\nMatthew McConaughey can be impressive (Free State of Jones '16) but also sometimes over the top (as here). Previously, he has also verbally praised God for his career, if he thinks God will look favourably on this mess, he needs to think again.  The talented Diane Lane is sadly, totally wasted as his casual town \u2018play' piece. \n\nCold-hearted ugly nonsense.",

His peaceful life is soon shattered when his ex-wife Karen tracks him down. Desperate for help, Karen begs Baker to save her -- and their young son -- from her abusive husband. She wants him to take the brute out for a fishing excursion -- then throw him overboard to the sharks. Thrust back into a life that he wanted to forget, Baker now finds himself struggling to choose between right and wrong.\" I've never watched a movie so insane, mind-boggling, utterly pretentious and yet unaware of its own illogic all at the same time. 'Serenity' is really unlike any movie I've ever seen. I was aware of its reputation and apparent awfulness before I went in, so I was simply expecting something so bad that I could laugh at and manage to have at least good time with it in that regard. Yet instead of laughing, I found my jaw-dropping at the complete lunacy and absurdity of the plot throughout the entirety of viewing. Later in this review I'll do something I never do, and that's go into spoilers. The plot-twist in this movie is so ridiculous and insane that I just have to talk about it. Until I get to that, it'll remain spoiler free. 'Serenity' fails at almost everything a film should do correctly. Its set-up is really bad, characters are unlikable, camerawork and editing can be laughable at times, and as I said the plot deep-dives into utter nonsense about halfway through the movie. I don't know how this story got green-lit or how any of these ideas came into fruition; all I know is that this is something that exists... If you read the description of the movie, and/or watched the trailer, it seems like a pretty straight-forward thriller/drama. It's not showing you how insane it really is. I've really never seen anything like this. I don't know what possessed Matthew McConaughey to sign onto this, or if he even read the full script. He's the most entertaining thing about the film, but that's just because he's basically doing his Matthew McConaughey shtick. As for Anne Hathaway, I truly like her as an actress but it saddens me to say that her acting is really bad here. I guess that might be due to the script they were all given, which overall was just very dumbed-down and lazy writing. Before I get into spoilers, I lastly want to say how shocked I was to find out this was directed by Steven Knight. If you're unaware of this man, he directed a film called 'Locke'. I absolutely loved that film and still think it's a near-flawless hidden gem. I just can't fathom how that same director could go from the genius and competence of 'Locke', to the complete polar-opposite and the mess that is 'Serenity'. Now let's get into those spoilers, you're in for a treat. SPOILERS AHEAD - If you have a random desire to ever watch this film, or be surprised at its insanity first-hand, this is your warning.\nSo, basically it's all just a video game... That's right... Our lead, Matthew McConaughey, is being controlled by his young son from another life, who is apparently a prodigy computer-game creator, and everyone that you've been watching in the movie is all just mere computer-code written up, so that the son can escape from his miserable reality and that he can fantasize about killing the deadbeat who abuses him and his mother every day in real-life... You just can't make this up... My head honestly hurts right now at just how crazy it all really was. Any time this embarrassment of a plot-twist was hinted at throughout the movie, I couldn't help but physically shake my head. I can at least say however, it was really entertaining to watch McConaughey descend into insanity after learning of what his own existence in the film really was. It goes so bash*t crazy about halfway through, that it's at least entertaining in that regard. Overall, 'Serenity' is a ridiculous film that is so full of itself and thinks it's a deep, metaphorical mystery, and will blow your mind; but not at how \"woke\" it is, rather due to your sheer inability to comprehend how it got made. I feel like they were wanting to be the next 'Matrix', in regards to the plot and wanting to make us question our own reality, and yet failed so miserably. Thinking about it now, I could honestly see myself throwing this film on again in the future, just so I could see the reactions of whoever else I'm watching it with. It's still a really bad movie, yet so insane that I can at least appreciate it in a guilty-pleasure aspect.\n\nMy Rating - 2/10",

If the point was to make it all feel a little off-kilter, it succeeded, that doesn't make it an easy watch because of it.\n\nSerenity, with the sort of third act twist that's both obvious and stupid, that both caters neither to the audience it's about, or the audience it's aimed at, and that feels like the kind of thing a classmate of mine would have written at university, it all leaves a sour taste in the mouth. OK fine! It would have been the kind of thing I would have written at university and maybe even tried to love if I had seen it at the cinema at 19, but now? It's a waste of McConaughey and Knight's talents and it's a bit of a cringe-fest and a lot of a joke.\n\nIn retrospect is the kind of thing that might have worked as a limited series where the reveal twist comes half way through and then part of the enjoyment is seeing noir through a different lens. As it is, it's high-quality, well made bollocks.\n\nI gave it one star for Bioshock injoke re: Fontaine fisheries.",

The acting was a little odd and the inclusion of several well known actors felt unneeded.

For every great new entry into the McConaissance, our favorite naked bongo-playing actor has to give us an equally bad flick from the shadow realm to maintain balance in the universe. In the same few months he gave us Moondog in Harmony Korine's The Beach Bum, Matthew McConaughey must have still been vacationing in the Bahama's where he ran into Steven Knight and said \"alright, alright, alright\" to whatever the director pitched to him in a tequila/prozac-induced stupor.\n\nGet a load of this. McConaughey is trying to catch a large tuna fish named \"Justice\", but he can hear his son talking to him in his head. Then his ex-wife, Anne Hathaway, asks him to kill Jason Clarke (because who doesn't want him dead, amirite? he sucks, and he's in everything). A whole bunch of questionable stuff happens, then McConaughey finds out that his life is weird because he's a video game character. Then he breaks out of the matrix, and I'm not sure but I think he's actually a ghost in the afterlife which is a fishing RPG his son made to deal with his death. The boy codes his abusive stepfather into the game to get McConaughey to kill him so that the boy can get up the courage to actually kill his stepfather in real life. And they do, I think, or something. We live in a society.\n\nI have many questions, like, since it's a video game, did the boy code his father's character to be a gigolo for Diane Lane so he can pay his fishing employee? Did the boy make his mom a NPC so Clarke could beat her naked with a belt? Did the boy code his father's character to get naked and jump off a cliff so he could reenact the album cover of Nirvana's \"Nevermind\"? Did he code his father to bang his mom from behind while she cries? I guess recontextualizing a neo-noir as a metanarrative that bends the rules of time, space, and consciousness can get messy quick, but at least it makes more sense than \"Lost\".\n\nI would highly recommend this one if you love the bizarre movie making missteps of Collateral Beauty or The Book of Henry. It's like \"tonal insanity\" is a film-genre at this point. I doubt the Coen brothers could even write a line as fitfully absurd as, \"You fish for one tuna, man. It's a tuna that's only in your head.\" Pure Gold.",

            "content": "Serenity Review \n\nI\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)ve picked up Serenity by accident In a lazy Sunday morning laid down in my bed with nothing more interesting to.\nAt first I thought it would be some kinda of a candy romance but maybe a good one because of the Oscars winners Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway, I recently found out that they are both Scorpio sign in astrology an me also being an Scorpio decided to see what was going on. Didn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)t paid attention to who was the director and went surprised When I found out that I love a bunch of he\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s movies and series! \nWell, the movie it\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s a little bit confusing due to it\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s mystery and the need to keep it slow to not share too much information too soon. \nI don\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)t know if the author was meaning to make this movie to describe someone\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s personality and behavior or if he was trying to share a clever analogy about life. In my case I felt he was describing an Scorpio personality and I will explain why I felt that.\nFirst of all as I have already mentioned the two main actors are both Scorpio sign, Matthew from November 4th and Anne from November 12th, as a Scorpio person have deep emotions due to its a still water sign ruled by Mars and Pluto, master of the eight house of mystery, occult, if you read about a Scorpio personality you\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)ll have a better understanding what I\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)m talking about.\nWell a Scorpio person is determined, revengeful and stubborn but they are moved by the right things, love, family and justice, the courage they have to help the loved ones and the determination to do it if they feel it\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s necessary, and most of all to do the things that they had decided to do because once they decided to do something they will not stop until they have it done! I\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)m not talking here about a low frequency Scorpio who can be a very bad person also because of the same reasons a high frequency Scorpio will have to not be. The movie shows this duality a Scorpio live inside a lot of times, the connection he have with his son, specially true the water, when he jumps in the ocean, when he touch the water at the table, when it\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s raining, the color palette of his clothes and also Anne\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s, the dark room where the kid live, his smartness, the kinda of situation a Scorpio person have to go true in life since early age to go true its transformation, scorpios are all about transformation and he will have to go true it for all his life to reach the highest level of a Scorpio which is the Fenix form. \nThere is an analogy in the movie when he talks about not understanding why he do the things he do and \u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2who\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2? decide it and when he starts to wondering about that, questioning himself he finds out the truth, the truth that anyone else can see or understand not even when he tells them, the astrology said that Scorpios knows and understand the truth about life and death and their path in this world. Oh, Scorpios also have the tendency of being addicted to alcohol or another drugs.\nIt is also possible that the island represents the earth. \nMaybe I\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)ll not understand Serenity and felt the connection with this movie if I wasn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)t a Scorpio person, i think I\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)ll never know haha.",

            "content": "Serenity (NO relation to the Firefly franchise, the ship, or the spin-off movie) is a hard thing to discuss or pin down without going into spoiler territory. Matthew McConaughey is the captain of a fishing boat named Serenity. He lives on a non-descript tropical island with a small, nosy community. Financially strained and subsidizing his meager income by prostituting himself to Diane Lane, his femme-fatale ex-wife (Anne Hathaway) shows up with $10 million dollars that she will give him if he pulls a hit on her new abusive husband. So yes, at first glance it looks like the \u00e2sweaty\u00e2? noir-ish thriller/star vehicle that Matthew McConaughey, Diane Lane, and Ashley Judd used to headline back in the 90\u00e2(TM)s, two of which are present here.\n\nBut it\u00e2(TM)s totally not. MASSIVE SPOILER AHEAD. Turns out that it\u00e2(TM)s all a video game created and played by the protagonist\u00e2(TM)s son, as a way to idolize his dead father (GASP!) and work out his own plan to murder his abusive step-father. Yep. This\u00e2\u00a6kind of sounds like The Book of Henry doesn\u00e2(TM)t it? But as where that infamous disaster switched tones at will and still wanted to be a saccharine melodrama, Serenity manages a consistent dark and paranoid tone, despite its sci-fi twist. It\u00e2(TM)s far from perfect. Serenity is messy, absurd, but consistently interesting and well-acted. The \u00e2McConaissance\u00e2? is pretty much over at this point, but Matthew McConaughey works this movie with the charm and raw gravitas that defines his more recent work. Hathaway has a nice showy turn as a woman with nothing to lose, Diane Lane is always a treasure, and Jeremy Strong leaves an icky impression as a creepy salesman, who pretty much knows he\u00e2(TM)s an NPC and is trying his damnedest to hide his opinion on the matter. Serenity predictably bombed and has the reputation of a misfire, more written about than actually watched. But its oddball story, Hard-R subject matter, and the genre-changing twist may make it a cult classic in future years. It\u00e2(TM)s worth a look.",

This film is deeply mystical, philosophical and religious. Anyone who has studied any of those fields or has the capacity for contemplative thought will immediately understand that. I'll probably watch this film another two times. If you don't get it, study Neville Goddard, William Blake and Judeo-Christian mysticism. The Father begets a son, a world is created, The Mother is abused, the son creates worlds through his imagination (in this case they come to life using deep-learning AI). In the end the only thing anyone knows is, I AM. Like the film Dark City, this movie deals with truth and could catalyze awakening. That's why it was buried by the Borg \"critics\".",

First of all, aside from a solid performance from Matthew McConaughey the rest of the acting is terrible in this movie. Even Anne Hathaway and Jason Clarke, who are usually pretty great, seem like they're only in the movie to pick up a paycheck. The director has a massive twist in the movie, which I appreciate, but then nothing else really happens. Once the twist happens the movie limps to the finish line, and at the end you kinda wonder why you even went to the movie in the first place. Plus, extremely unnecessary explicit material is annoying as well. Overall, I was pretty disappointed by this movie. Don't see it in theaters and I wouldn't even recommend it for Redbox.",

Matthew McConaughey, who once lamented that every movie he did required him to remove his shirt, now returns to doing that very thing in a story about a grouchy fisherman who's discovered he's in a video game. The concept sounds lame, and it is, and it's not helped by the fact that the script is banal, the pacing is slack and little is done to make us care about any of the characters. Half of them don't actually exist, so why are we supposed to feel for them? It's a film that tries way too hard to be smart, and ends up exposing its shortcomings as a result. It certainly has a cast of talented performers, with at least 2 Oscar winners, but they all look actively baffled at both the premise and the lines they're saying, and I can't say I blame them. It's a major misstep for all involved, but I suspect it will have a more profound impact on the Writer/Directors career than that of any of the actors.",

            "content": "I always love when an original concept makes it to the big screen, but sadly, not every original idea will resonate with every viewer. In the case of Serenity, it seems as though many people have chosen to be detached from it in terms of relatability. I admire when filmmakers go out of their way to create a bizarre world that usually would not work, but goes for it anyways. Unfortunately, Serenity is one of the strangest films I have seen in quite some time and also one that I feel is quite terrible as a whole. Although there was an effort to impress here, it failed on many levels and here is why.\n\nAfter a burnout fisherman is approached by his ex-wife, his new mission turns into whether or not he is okay with murdering her new husband, due to his violence toward her and their son. That premise alone works as a movie, but that is about as much as I can say without ruining where the film takes a turn. This is where I admire the filmmakers for trying, even though it did not work at all. The twist that this film delivers may work for a handful of people, but I fear that viewers will most likely laugh once the film reveals what it is truly about.\n\nMatthew McConaughey is a fantastic actor and has truly proven his worth throughout the past decade or so. Nominated for numerous awards and appearing in Oscar-nominated films consistently, I always look forward to the next project he chooses to sink his teeth into. While I will not say his performance is fantastic here, he is definitely committed from start to finish. He carries this movie in a dramatic way, but his wacky character feels a little fake at times. He is quite over-the-top here and it almost stood out as a negative to me.\n\nOn top of this crazy performance, as I mentioned, the twist this film delivers is one of the best and worst twists I have witnessed in years. There is a sense of humour to it for the viewers, but the movie takes everything so seriously that it really collapsed as a whole. This film would have had a lot of potential if it winked at the audience, but it just asked you to buy into the entire premise as if it were real. This aspect of the film alone is what turned me off. I enjoyed watching this film in a weird way, but that does not mean I actually liked the film.\n\nIn the end, Serenity is a great film to watch if you are a film lover and have someone to watch the film with, while having a few drinks. There were times when I had to question how these filmmakers thought certain plot devices were going to work for the majority of moviegoers because it simply feels ridiculous when the true storyline kicks in. Serenity may end up being on my list of films to never watch from 2019, but it certainly is a memorable one, so take from that what you will.",

            "content": "Where to begin on this one. That is the question, Well, let me first begin by saying I saw the trailer for this film a few months back and found it to be very intriguing. The premise looked interesting. It had McConaughey and Hathaway. I expected a nicely crafted thriller. Sadly, that's not what we got. The film begins with fisherman, Baker Dill, on a fishing venture with drunks looking for some tuna. All of a sudden, a big catch presents itself and Baker goes nuts for it. He wants this big catch because he is chasing this imp-articular fish. I was thinking there was something in his past that was causing this. Not the case. Anyway, he is so obsessed with getting it that he points his knife at his customers and goes out with the intent everyday to get his catch, no matter what it takes to get the money for gas and lures to do it. Even sleeping with a local woman, Constance, played by Diane Lane. Things get more mysterious when Baker's ex wife, Karen, played by a wasted Anne Hathaway, shows up and wants him to take her current husband on a fishing trip to kill him because of his abusive ways. From the sounds of all this, it seems like a straight ford story that could have some twists along the way. That is what initially sold me. Unfortunately, that's not what we get. There is a twist but a very poor one with a disappointing explanation. Before I get into the why, let's talk about the cast. McConaughey plays the role just fine. He pulls off the drunken and disturbed, Baker Dill, with conviction and purpose. He fit the role well and his portrayal had be curious as to what was going on until the poor twist near the middle of the film. Anne Hathaway is just wasted here. It is almost like she is too good for this role and it shows. She is used here as no more then a sex puppet and goes around just seducing both men and comes off just too much like eye candy. The reason I say she is wasted is because this character does not have many layers to it. I thought when we had the scene with her new husband showing up and abusing her that more layers were to come but it never did. Diane Lane is just OK here. She is not given much to do other than to have sex with Baker to give him money, watch him through a window, and tell him about her missing Cat. Everybody else in the film feels more filler and along for the ride. Without me going too far into spoiler territory, there is a scene in the middle of the film where a businessman following Baker around finally gets to talk to him. We are told he is selling him fishing equipment for him to try but he knows what Baker's plan is for killing Karen's husband the next day. Something is off about him and this is where the problem is and where the film officially lost me. His reasoning and the explanation for the whole film sounds crazy and that's because it is. It provides the whole driving force of the third act and becomes wholly predictable. At this point, I lost interest in the film because it was so ridiculous, I no longer cared to what was going to happen. The ending makes sense but the issue remains that the whole film just feels odd, the story wasted, and a weak payoff with no peaking point. The only positive thing I can take away from the film is McConaughey's performance. All in all, this film was just too disappointing for me to recommend. The story and resolve are just too odd and I can't forgive how much Hathaway is wasted because she is just too good of an actress for this.",

He just wants to keep to himself, make enough money to get by and drink some rum at the end of the day.  All that is about to change when a woman from his past (Anne Hathaway) shows up and offers him $10 million to murder her husband on a fishing trip.  Now I like the cast of this, but there was nothing about the posters, trailers or even word of mouth that made want to see this.  It wasn't until I actually listened to a negative review that my interest spiked.  To explain, I was told that you had to see it to believe it, because this has a twist that would put M. Night to shame in the worst way possible.  Well, in that regard, I have to say: I got exactly what I came for.  I will not get into spoilers here, because that's not the type of blog that I run over here, but good LORD, this is the type of movie that makes you want to call up an old friend and talk about what they try to pull.  I don't remember the last time I saw a movie even attempt something like this, and if there was more than just one other person in the theater I saw this in, I am fairly certain I would have seen people walking out when it shifts from the second to third act.  Here's what I think happened: I think that McConaughey's agent didn't actually read the full script, maybe skimmed it at best.  Contracts were signed because it was an exotic shooting location, and then other people got onboard with it once they saw that he was involved.  I don't think it is a spoiler for me to say that there is a twist involved; for the entire first hour, they are laying down breadcrumbs that there is a reveal coming.  You just don't know the extent of it, and if you thought what they pulled in Adrift was bad, you have not seen anything yet.  I apologize that this is all that I can talk about, but if you actually watch this, I promise you: this will be all that you will want to talk about as well.  What is wild to me is that this doesn't start off all that bad.  Sure, it is derivative to Moby Dick, but it holds your attention because there are decent actors on the screen.  But once you get to that reveal, it just nosedives like a plane crash.  If you watch bad movies on purpose or like to see the extent of how bad writing can fail, then I have to give this a big recommendation.  For everybody else, it is something that you should avoid if you can, because you're going to walk away angry.",

The movie asks you to both appreciate the idea as well as accept the things you\u2019ll likely hated in the first half of the movie based on their relationship to the idea. This is a lot to ask of most viewers. While I personally can appreciate both, I understand why most didn\u2019t.

            "content": "\"Serenity\" deserves real interest and support.  Not because it's a perfect movie - very few are, this one certainly is not.  It deserves attention for playing with genre stereotypes and nudging boundaries in a truly interesting way.\n\nIn 2013, Writer/Director Steven Knight was applauded by critics for \"Locke.\"  In that film, with the exception of the opening scene, all the action takes place inside a car during a long drive to London.  In \"Serenity,\" Knight spends the first half of the movie putting a blockbuster cast through its paces to set up a fairly conventional film noir.  He then spends the remainder turning the genre inside-out, offering a bit of existential introspection (do any of us truly know anything?) and providing some thoughts about the consequences of domestic violence.\n\nPresumably because of the film's lofty aspirations, Knight has been able to assemble a powerhouse cast.  Baker Dill (Matthew McConaughey) is a dissolute fishing boat captain, traumatized by war and seeking solace at the end of the world.   Soon enough, his ex-wife (Anne Hathaway) arrives with a typically noirish proposition:  if Dill will take her abusive husband (played powerfully by Jason Clarke) on a one-way fishing expedition, Dill can have the husband's $10 million in ill-gotten gains.  Diane Lane makes an odd appearance as a very-part-time love interest and neighborhood watch lady.\n\nMcConaughey's performance, which carries the film, is a slow burn.  Early on, he is portrayed as a man burying his anger, trauma, resentment and pain in booze, with all the enigmatic enthusiasm he brings to selling Lincoln Navigators.  As the plot develops (thickens, curdles, insert your own verb here), McConaughey's intensity ratchets up appropriately, to a very satisfying climax.\n\nBusting genres is not for the faint of heart.  Professional critics have generally savaged this film.  In my view, they are wrong.  This is a very imperfect film.  Beyond Baker Dill, none of the characters are developed in a meaningful way.  The existential \"reveal\" in the middle of the film offers an array of thematic options, none of which are pursued fully.  Despite its failures, this movie deserves a thoughtful, engaged audience.  These days, films waste too much time playing it safe - too many superheroes, too many mind-numbing sequels.  There are too few films that, like \"Serenity,\" are willing to take real chances.",

Matthew McConaughey was an all star for making it through this mess of a script and still delivering an amazing performance along with the rest of the cast.  Now for the actual twist of the movie I believe that's what ruined the film entirely for me.  I was fine a cliche murder thriller/drama about an ex-husband murdering some jerk of a husband mistreating the family.  What I got was what felt like a director trying to be profound and instead turned out to be terrible.

I didn\u2019t like this movie and neither did many people. The trailer was really good and made it look so interesting. The cast was stellar and it looked to make for a good thriller. The script and plot was what actually ruined it. It was so boring. Oscar nominated Steven Knight has wrote some good scripts and directed a couple good movies (Locke being one of my favorite). He had the right idea with the plot, but made it lackluster with the most bizarre twist halfway through. That twist literally had me laughing in my seat because it didn\u2019t work and it was just so random. If anyone who contributed to the $4.4 million it made this past weekend (the budget was $25 million and it\u2019ll never make that back) they probably agree. The start of the movie made it look kind of like it was going to be a 90s thriller on water. Even the score, cinematography, and title looked like that which I thought was odd. Speaking of cinematography, every time a new character was introduced they did a fast cut from their back to their face which was annoying. I don\u2019t know what to say. I don\u2019t feel like spoiling the twist because I don\u2019t want to talk about that whole mess. It could\u2019ve been interesting but the way it was executed and with the whole script and story it didn\u2019t work.

Well that is exactly what happened so be prepared for that possibility for you too. Walking in I had only seen a few guesses about the predicted box office draw and how Serenity was poised to be low due to the mystery of what the movie was even about, and the low promotion it seemed to be receiving. I thought I might be in for a secret gem. Matthew McConaughey is my favorite actor so I thought she'd be happy with it. Do we get the rugged Matthew instead of the squeaky clean rom-com? Why yes we do! Do we get a serious and very dramatic Anne? Yes we do. However the movie becomes comically predictable within minutes. If you've ever played any RPG you know there's only one bar, and there's always an old timer at the bar waiting for someone to buy him a drink. At that scene I called it. Then I spent the next... I dunno... too long, picking out every moment that reinforced this until the BIG REVEAL which was not a reveal at all of course. Now, do I like mind twisty movies? Yes... but trying to make some sort of psychic connection with what became a self aware AI in your game... by touching water apparently... well that seemed to be there just to try to convince you it wasn't a game so you'd be fooled until the reveal. It didn't work. Everything else, it was a grind. It had boring moments, it involved the choices and options you would see in an exciting fishing game, except instead of getting to play that game, you have to watch the AI walk through it and still never catch the dang fish!\n\nMy wife was so uninterested she fell asleep in the theater and so I propped her up and just tried to make her comfortable, asking multiple times if she just wanted to leave. As a huge movie fan, I have NEVER walked out of a movie early, and really never had the desire, but I would have been ok leaving this movie, especially if I knew how how ridiculously stupid the ending would be and that I could avoid hearing Anne Hathaway creepily repeating \"Daddy\" in the build-up. Oh and the number of times they kept calling him \"Dale\" instead of \"Dill\".\n\nAfter this movie my wife said she didn't love me anymore. I have no idea what the future holds for my family, but I know it will not be a repeat viewing of this movie. I'm very sorry to have seen the acting talent in this movie wasted on such a terrible movie. But when seeing a poor film before, I have been known to say \"they can't all be hits\" and to be honest I'm confident everyone will bounce back from this. Except for my wife and I. This looks to be permanent.\n\nThanks Serenity.",

But admiration can get you only so far, for on terms of merit, it wouldn't even qualify as a definite film, in its entirety. After that big horn blows and the curtain drops which Knights has clearly been excited about, the question of its existence starts raising up and piling up, what sounds like a mere discussion is fabricated into a provoking exotic thriller. I can understand the work that Knight poured into the storytelling, it is clearly visible, he has been mature about his secret, he doesn't leave it till the last moment, he attempts to pin down a metaphorical satire of being- among all other possible being- a human.\n\nHe has made sure that before the scrutiny hits big on screen, there are enough elements spread around to have a firm grip over his audience and enough quirkiness to make you sit back on your sit. Clearly, using all his guns directed towards these aspects, he lost the practicality among the world or the conversation which let's be honest film relies upon in its early stages. And not that these conversations are chalky but pretentious.\n\nThere is one thing to be aware of viewers' expectation on contradicting or questioning the plot and another to voluntarily be blatant about it; too much of anything, especially this, will spoil it. Armed by a brilliant cast, the performance comes off to be the most disappointing experience of all. With none whatsoever commitment or conviction on portraying such edgy characters does any cast comes off even slightly appreciative. Personally, I am amazed by the performance, from both Hathaway and McConaughey.\n\nIf these incredibly talented artists has given us some of the best work of their career, they have also managed to give us the worst, without holding back, now this is a range not everyone can cover. Whispering with a smooth voice throughout the film, no matter how irrelevant, McConaughey can and does own that body languages, but Hathaway desperately trying to join in the club, fails so vigorously, that it aches you to go someone through this.\n\nThe other supporting cast like Lane, Clarke and Hounsou are mere pawn of a narration that acts accordingly, like a flat rigid chess pieces with no urge to express. What's worse above all, is that we can clearly see what Knight was going for but how is it coming across like and him being not able to scoff off that difference is not at all affordable. Unfortunately, there is nothing to look back and pick out as even comparatively a better part of a film, no matter what we might think, soaking wet McConaughey doesn't count as one. Is there any serenity in Serenity, yes, it will end after an hour and a half, as opposed to what it may feel like.",

The final message is the number one reason why I don\u00e2(TM)t recommend anyone to see this movie, especially if you take teens or kids with you. Matthew McConaughey is good enough to avoid a total disaster, and I know that there was something incredible behind all of this horrible mess. It\u00e2(TM)s probably going to end up as one of the worst films of 2019, unless we have a truly disastrous year in cinema.\"",

The concept is widely interesting, and I feel with some tweaking it would have been executed much better. Overall not the worst thing I\u2019ve ever seen, but it may leave you questioning if the trailer released for this film was a mess up, as this was not what I expected. ",

Too many people are writing this off as \"insane\" only because of the challenge the film takes to be more than a trite and predictable tale. \n\nThere are many nuances such as camera angles, lighting, and props that all feel out of place in such a genre flick because they are tells eluding to what the film is actually about. These aren't getting much discussion. For me, this reveal deepened the motivations and purpose of the film much more so than other more well loved twists. Shutter Island comes to mind as one such highly praised twist that ultimately adds little to the story. \n\nAs much as I am defending the movie, I must admit that Serenity is far from perfect. Its biggest sin is the fact that the main character of the real story gets very little screen time. The absence of their perspective from the start results in an experience that can easily be read as dishonest and nutty. Were the plot and twist identical, but this seemingly minor character got much more focus from the beginning, I am convinced that this film would be heralded as genius and praised among the greatest of topsy turvy outings.",

All of these actors on their own have had brilliant movies, so it's not a stretch to expect something better than what Serenity delivers.\n\nThere's a twist in the movie that I won't ruin for anyone. I'll just say that the twist ruins the movie. The initial concept presented in the first 45 minutes actually shows potential. It's a shame that the filmmakers didn't explore that path. Instead, they tried some twist that made it feel like a rejected M. Night Shyamalan movie idea.\n\nThe movie gets annoying near the end. You feel like this movie thinks it's way more clever than it really is. These \"thriller\" movies with the big twist in the end can be a high-risk formula. When they work, people absolutely love the film for fooling them with such a clever story. When they fail, it ruins everything the movie had been working for in the last hour.\n\nI'm only giving it a three because the initial concept had promise and I'm a fan of the lead actors in this film. Perhaps they each received some bad advice from their people before signing on for this movie.\n\nI'll leave you with this. There's a few sex scenes in this movie. You won't think too much about them at first. But once the twist is revealed, you'll think back in the theater lobby that those sex scenes were really messed up.\n\nMy advice is to save yourself a trip to the theater. It's worth a rental from Redbox in a few months. The laugh you'll get from how bad the ending is will be worth the buck and change.",

I was thrilled to be watching something unique, and thought provoking, with many layers. I typically don't like Mathew McConaughey, and find him irritating in movies, but, astonishingly, he worked here. Highly recommend you go see this, and give it a chance. Let the movie ramp up before you judge it. All the people who rated this low because they don't understand what was going on are either really dumb, or have the attention span of a fart.

McConaghey, Hathaway and Lane are better than this.  I think they were going for a Coen'esque type movie with the caliber of a Francis McDormand.  Epic fail.  I will say McConaghey did seem like he was trying but Hathaway and Lane acted like they were in a tv soap opera, and not a very good one.  Hard to describe the plot without giving the \"surprise\" away.  I'll just say the film involves rage, sex, betrayal, physical/psycholgical abuse and love.  Sounds like a good movie, right?  Not so fast!  Skip it and you'll never know the difference.",

Usually reliable writer/director Steven Knight delivers a poor script and shoddy direction. But there is one great thing about the film: the twist. I will not spoil it but it\u2019s the utterly bizarre. It is very audacious and while it definitely doesn\u2019t work, I respect it. Respect doesn\u2019t equal a good film. Overall, I have no idea what possessed Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway to do this film. It\u2019s awful on nearly every level. This film is a special kind of bad. It\u2019s very funny in ways it definitely shouldn\u2019t be. For that reason, honestly see it if you are looking for something to make fun of with friends. If you\u2019re looking for a good thriller, go somewhere else. ",
