            "content": "Telling the story of an intoxicating affair between two 18th century women, Céline Sciamma directs Noémie Merlant and Adèle Haenel in this passionate drama. After premiering at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, the film went on to win the Queer Palm and Best Screenplay. The film also received nominations for nine César Awards and a BAFTA Film Award. 'Portrait of a Lady on Fire' also marks the third collaboration between Haenel and Sciamma, both previously working on the 2007 drama 'Water Lillies' and the short film 'Pauline'.\n\nSet on an isolated island in Brittany, a young painter, Marianne (Noémie Merlant), is tasked to paint a wedding portrait of Héloïse (Adèle Haenel) without her knowledge. Marianne must discreetly observe her model as she works under the illusion of companionship. But as feelings between the two women flourish, an ardent romance begins between the two women.\n\nShot in 7k, nearly every shot in the film resembles a painting. Claire Mathon makes sure none of the lighting comes off too harsh and does a splendid job of making the light seem natural in both exterior and interior shots. The smooth camera movements help immerse the viewer in the scene as the camera follows the character and the lack of cuts within these shots aids the audience in feeling like they're watching each sequence as it unfolds. Diegetic sound also plays a role in drawing in the viewer. Mixed with the absence of a score, it helps the viewer to feel like they're right there with Marianne and Héloïse. Sciamma stated the reason the film lacks a score is so that viewers can be obsessed with the rhythm of each scene in both the body movements and the camera.\n\nThroughout the film, both women each have a main outfit. Marianne wears a refined, red dress, a colour that directly opposes Héloïse's vibrant green dress. Both fabric-heavy garments are perfectly juxtapositioned in terms of colour and style; each representing the character's personality. As well as being shot in an 18th-century castle, the costumes emphasise the authenticity of the film. Noémie Merlant and Adèle Haenel both give incredible performances across the film. Luàna Bajrami gives a great performance as the housemaid whom Héloïse and Marianne help to get an abortion.\n\nSciamma does a great job bringing delicate themes to the forefront of 'Portrait of a Lady on Fire', including abortion and arranged marriage, both of which were issues that women faced in the 18th century. These sensitive themes are handled with care and aren't glorified by the director. The story of Orpheus and Eurydice also holds some importance to the story. For example, both women choose the memory of each other and when Marianne leaves Héloïse, Héloïse asks Marianne to turn around, like how Eurydice asks Orpheus to turn around.\n\nSomething viewers might notice is the distinct lack of men in the film, the few scenes that feature male characters, they're either barely focused on or purposely have their back turned to the camera, supporting the fact that the film is a love letter to the female gaze. Sciamma doesn't oversexualize the relationship between these two women, and any nudity featured feels incredibly natural. Viewers will pick up on the suggestive imagery lightly scattered through the film, the most obvious one being the scene in which an armpit is made to look like a piece of the female anatomy.\n\nOverall, 'Portrait of a Lady on Fire' is an erotic, sensual love story between two women in a short-lived affair. Sciamma brings viewers a story that delves into the exploration of love and its inevitable departure. Films that have a resemblance to 'POALOF', in terms of its central love story include the 2017 drama 'Disobediance' and Francis Lee's 2019 feature 'Ammonite'. Helmed by brilliant performances and artistic cinematography, the film is a visually stunning feature that spans over 120 minutes.",

The countess of some rocky island off of Brittany (Valeria Golino) commissions Marianne (Noémie Merlant) to paint her daughter, Héloïse (Adèle Haenel), who has always refused to have her portrait done and instead fled to join a convent. Pretending to be a hired companion, Marianne must capture Héloïse's body and mien mentally to surreptitiously paint her — on one walk, she studies her hand, on another, her chin. Although Héloïse is betrothed to a Milanese man, she and Marianne fall for each other and undergo a brief dalliance. This is the \"lying in bed and staring into each other's eyes\" sort of love. The myth of Orpheus and Eurydice is not only read but folded into the plot wonderfully. Only after reviewing the Wiki for the film did I realize that there was no traditional score, which made the \"women chanting/singing\" scene at the bonfire so much more profound. It's sexual tension done in a subtle and original way. Everything about this movie is beautiful. \"Do all lovers feel like they're inventing something?\" I mean, come on. Does any single line capture the feeling of new love more than that one? Portrait of a Lady on Fire is a must-watch.",

It appeals so elegantly with such felt realism through the designs and coordination manifesting gracefulness via performative aid, alongside the piqued haunt that could act as an expressive branch to a heart's desire. This is more artistic than narrative as it patiently proceeds with the filmmaking artist wanting to explore the aforementioned desire that leaves storytelling secondary, meaning in other elaborative words the artist focused itself's own craft without considering on being watched by intrigued audience towards a working art. Genuinely brilliant period drama without much reasonable engagement. (B)",

The movie has no music(except some scenes) and its pretty silent while the dialogues are slow and clear giving you the whole vibe of isolation. I was feeling through out the first half of the movie that I am going to painter her as well and I found my self noticing little details about her. The second half I didn't like it tho when the romance unravels between the painter and the lady I lost the whole excitement about the movie and become a boring romance in my opinion. I found it completely unnecessary. The scenes about the oldshool type abortions where really shocking. I think the movie started well but didn't end well.

The only catch is that it is the young woman's mother (Valeria Golino) who did the hiring, and the young woman can't know about the job since she outright refuses to pose.  Therefore, she must paint it in secret.  Now I always meant to check this one out, but I never found the time.  It was the one remaining film I wanted to see but missed on my 2019 best of the year list.  I felt it was only appropriate that I finish 2019 for good before 2021 started, so I figured I could get this in under the wire.  While I can't say that I am precisely the target audience for this film, I can say that the filmmaking here is impressive.  Now I was prepared for something that was on the art house side of the spectrum.  There is a bit of inaccessibility that sometimes comes with sophistication, which is why I put this off for as long as I did.  Right off the bat, however, I found myself pulled in by the cinematography.  It's gorgeous and breathtaking, and in my opinion, it is the reason to watch it.  As you can probably imagine, there are several scenes in this where you are just watching an artist paint, and I know how mundane that sounds, but director Céline Sciamma shoots it in such a way that makes it attention-grabbing.  Both of the leads here are talented as well.  I would liken Merlant to if Emma Watson and Lily James had a baby, and Haenel has a Greta Gerwig quality about her both in looks and acting abilities.  The story is bare-bones, but the fact that you are in on the secret makes tension for the audience.  I will say that I was much more invested in the first half than I was in the second.  I was more into this story of this renegade painter.  Once it shifts gears into the forbidden romance story that it is advertised to be, that is when this became more standard for me.  Everybody is already well aware of how accepting society was two hundred years ago, so you can make a reasonably educated guess on how all of this will end up.  Portrait of a Lady on Fire is a movie that you let wash over you, and I think that will give you an idea on if this is for you or not.  If you gravitate towards foreign and artsy films, you will have a high chance of enjoying this.  I also think that there's another audience that will just be bored with this.  I don't think either camp is wrong; I lean more towards the former than the latter, even though I identify as being in the middle.  I give this one a decent recommendation.",

Heloïse teaches Marianne to look, even when seeing is uncomfortable, and to paint what she sees, not what convention demands. Sciamma's film, every frame of which  recalls a masterpiece of painting, teaches us, too, to see the everyday (albeit an 18th-century Brittany everyday) with the visual acuity of an artist. \n\nThe characters pose the question of why, in Ovid's tale,  the musician Orpheus turned to look at his beloved Euridice before she emerged from the underworld, thereby sending her back into death and dooming himself to unending loss. The painter says that Orpheus chose remembering over possessing. Her subject suggests that Eurydice told Orpheus to turn around, achieving his fate and hers.  \n\nThe film asserts the indispensability of suffering to the formation of both the sensibility of the artist and the receptive capacity of the artist's audience. In this rendering of Ovid's story, both lovers are responsible for the love affair's end. Like Ovid, they understand that, in the words of Wallace Stevens, \"death is the mother of beauty.\"  In the final scene we see Heloïse, attentively listening to a concert performance of Vivaldi's The Four Seasons, sobbing silently, and smiling between her sobs.",

The organic growth of the relationship and the clandestine, conflicted nature of its development are both spot on; small moments that seize the screen and spark something greater. The film is mesmerizing, like being lulled to sleep but somehow preserving an electric current throughout each scene. Merlant and Haenel put on a clinic in passion, which they show to not be a constantly hyperactive state, but can be restrained without losing potency. A simple, powerful love story that embraces the tragedy of love's inevitable fate, made all more poignant and pressing by the circumstances of these two women; contrasting a painting that will endure (but that represents a loveless, expedient relationship) with the abridged, doomed, powerful beauty of true passion is like comparing an abyss to a supernova. Honestly, I'm struggling to find a way in which this film could have been meanignfully improved upon. (5/5)",

The relationship is based on two women and for once a film chose not to over-sexualize a single moment of their relationship. It was a breath of fresh air to see the authenticity of modern day feminism in a historical light. If I had fully connected with the protagonists and felt more emotion and passion through their love, this movie would have received a full 4 star rating. If you are looking for a poetic and artistic film with a beautiful portrayal of the femme struggle this is it.",

Sciamma uses the tale of the relationship between these two women to bring to light some social commentary of the expectations and the ways in which the patriarchy constricts the lives of females. This film clearly displays how what a woman wants at the time is not as important as what it is deemed that a man needs. Unlike other films within this genre this film is slow paced, with the sounds of the film being subtle and soft rather than a bombardment. Much like in Sciamma's other films, there is an emphasis on the fluidity of sexual and gender identity, with important social commentary on feminism. This film clearly shows that the patriarchy constricts women in the fact that it does not allow them to pursue the life that they would want for themselves, and it does not allow them their individuality. All in all I would give this film three out of five stars. While I found the social commentary within the film to be important and striking and the cinematography, especially concerning the lighting of each place to highlight important aspects of the story, I found that the storyline was predictable and moved at a very slow pace. The film was fairly effective however, as the cinematography for each scene placed emphasis on the particular characters. Furthermore, I found the use of the sound of the rustling of fabric and characters footsteps to help in adding tension to the scene. Nevertheless, the plot of the film was predictable which often caused me to lose interest. Similar to other films within this genre it brings some extremely important issues to light without it having to be represented by those whom the issues do not affect. This film shows how women are unable to pursue their wants and aspirations in life because of the constrictions of the patriarchy.",

Everything is so heartfelt from Sciamma's true to life quiet direction to the lack of music until Vivaldi's classical piece thunders into your heart. The finale is so devastatingly emotional that I was moved to tears. Sciamma's writing is authentic to how women speak and converse naturally with her deft dialogue.\n\nPortrait of a Lady on Fire focuses on the irresistible glances of a lover longing for their passionate feelings to be requited. Sciamma directs with a feminist lesbian lens that portrays her subjects with care and compassion instead of the usual male gaze view these films often end up appearing. Portrait of a Lady on Fire feels earnest and comes across as if Blue Is the Warmest Color were directed by a woman with tasteful nudity and realistic encounters. I feel like Blue Is the Warmest Color, Carol, Novitiate, and Persona are influences on Sciamma here, which are all wonderful films to be inspired by in all honesty. Portrait of a Lady on Fire is a splendid arthouse film from a master director, Céline Sciamma, whom I wish to see more movies from as soon as she directs them!\n\nNoémie Merlant is brilliant and expressive as a lead actress portraying the sorrowful and curious Marianne. Her eyes reveal such passion and longing. Her chemistry with Adèle Haenel as Heloise is palpable. They are both convincing as desperate for attachment and love with a sincere quality to their acting. Haenel is very subtle and reserved like Bibi Andersson in Persona, while Merlant plays the more outgoing and lively Liv Ullmann lady as Marianne. Merlant and Haenel are brilliant actresses, who give all their heartfelt acting in their performances within Portrait of a Lady on Fire. Both French ladies are so gorgeous and captivating. Merlant and Haenel both act so naturalistically and elusively fiery that they feel untaught.\n\nLuàna Bajrami is excellent as the sweet maid Sophie, who bravely undergoes an abortion. Her scenes playing with the ladies are fun. She's a nice addition of warmth and personality to Portrait of a Lady on Fire. Valeria Golino is fierce as La Comtesse in her controlling and commanding performance depicting cold motherhood.\n\nClaire Mathon's lush cinematography shoots Portrait of a Lady on Fire in 8K for a clear view of every beach, dreamy eye, and mesmerizing face. Her wide shots are perfectly framed with a symmetrical aesthetic that is stunning. Her close-ups are my favorite shots in Portrait of a Lady on Fire as each facial shot reveals numerous emotions with a verite that's undeniable. Portrait of a Lady on Fire may be the best looking film I've ever seen.\n\nJulien Lacheray's editing is sleek and refined, making Portrait of a Lady on Fire an engrossing 120 minutes that never bores you. It's a slow burn romance that blazes into a passionate inferno of affection. Dorothee Guiraud and Agathe Meinnemare's period costumes are decadent and delicious! The already iconic green posing dress, blue dress with lace gloves and mask, and red dress are all truly lovely.\n\nIn conclusion, Céline Sciamma simply directed one of the greatest pictures to have ever graced the theaters with elegant cinematic vision.",

            "content": "Love in a brave new world free of societal law.\n\nPortrait of a Lady on Fire is the story of two women who experience freedom from heteronormativity for a brief period in time allowing for them to express themselves openly and without shame. The premise revolves around Marianne, a classical painter, who is commissioned to create a portrait of a young women, Heloise, in order to create appeal to a male suitor from abroad. Although set in the 1700s, the era itself is irrelevant as this is a timeless endeavor akin to the photographs that are displayed on the social dating applications of today's age. The portrait and the photograph both seemingly artistic interpretations of the creator themselves. Given that the static painting sets her destiny, Heloise refuses to pose; thus, Marianne must study her profile in secret and in doing so, sets Heloise concretely into her assumed romanticized societal role, i.e., to succumb to the desires of a stranger and marry. In the intimacy granted to them in order to complete the portrait, Marianne and Heloise fall in love. This is possible as they are temporarily conceded a safe and isolated space that has been created given the circumstances of their encounter.\nThis space is a brave new world that is free of men, societal patriarchy and the societal norms that govern human sexuality. However, the characters and audience remain acutely aware of Heloise's fate in that she will be forced back onto the path of marriage; in part, largely due to the portrait Marianne so tenderly paints. In today's age, this path may be paralleled to marriage, children and the white picket fence. In the time they have together, Marianne and Heloise experience a break from these structures, which allow them to unreservedly express their emotions, bodies and sexuality without the shame that arises from others in a male dominated society. This is demonstrated in the film by the lack of superficial gestures (e.g. make-up, fancy garb) and unabashed scenes of the young housemaid invoking an abortion as though this act were just a milestone in being a liberated woman. These scenes help to unmask the characters so that they can truly see each other's beauty, allowing them to love freely without the restraints of norms and rites. This is very reminiscent of The Phantom Thread where Woodcock removes Alma's lipstick so that he can see who he is talking to. In both cases, the characters are stripped of how \"they should be\" to \"how they are\". In Portrait of a Lady on Fire removing societal expectations also removes from the characters the imposition of gender norms and barriers. Marianne and Heloise, rather than being portrayed as two lesbians may be seen as simple two human beings who have met in an idealistic world void of the laws and rites that would normally govern them. And it so happens, that in this world, these two human beings fall in love. Star crossed lovers; one could say. In sum, the beauty of Portrait of a Lady on Fire lies in the idea that love between two human beings is pure and true regardless of the labels we have created for such an intimacy. The characters, in their created world, abide by this vision of love. As Heloise inquires of Marianne, \"[...] have you known love?\", she does not specify that she is referring to the love of a man but rather the pure love between human beings. In their temporary world, free of the grips of the created, outside world, Marianne and Heloise are experiencing love as a concept separate from gender. And in that world, love has no bounds.",

Director Celine Sciamma's latest may be a joy to look at, and its content may indeed constitute an earnest, heartfelt feminine manifesto, but it often comes across as somewhat tentative and restrained in going all-out for what it really wants to say (especially with a title that includes the words \"on fire\" in it). To be sure, this is a fine piece of filmmaking in many regards, but rising to the level of \"masterpiece\" sincerely requires more than what's served up here.",

Streaming exclusively on MUBI now, and with a free trial, I thought I would finally give it a go and I am glad I did. At 2 hours long, this slow deliberately paced French film from Celine Sciamma, sumptuously shot and elegantly composed, reminds me immediately of Jane Campion's The Piano. Noemie Merlant plays Marianne, a painter hired by Adele Haenal's Heloise's family to paint her portrait secretly for the latter's husband-to-be in Milan; and their performances are often nuanced and always confident and fearless. With Heloise's mother and a maid in supporting roles, the film isolates this group of women mostly within the four walls of their remotely situated mansion. The staging is stark and almost theatrical, with no score and just the occasional use of Vivaldi's Violin Concerto No.2, which eventually lands a formidable emotional punch in the film's final scene. Sciamma's Cannes winning script is finely tuned, often understating, yet its symmetrical structure and call-backs are wonderfully clever and beautifully written. Likewise, her visual work as a director, is full of meaningful imageries and symbolism, though I'd argue this borders sometimes on the pretentious. I can totally see this ticks a lot of boxes for critics and the issues this film covers, including an abortion subplot thrown in for good measure for the maid, are all very noble and moving, even. It's a shame then that I never feel as intensely invested or affected in their 11 day relationship, as I did watching Brokeback Mountain or God's Own Country; despite a lovely coda that brings a satisfying closure to both their relationship and the film. However, I will certainly be more enthusiastic with Sciamma's next film after this experience.",

Honestly, it's one of the most perfect movies I've ever seen.

As Marianne, the painter observes her subject unaware that her subject observes her back in admiration. The movie one could say is about the art of gaze, on how strong just a look of admiration can be, how through gaze even the observed becomes the observer.\nAll performances are very real and powerful. The movie feels real to us, it doesn't tell a made up love story which most of us wont relate to. The love feels real, the intimacy feels natural. However, it isn't just a love story. It talks about freedom and liberty and how easily one could lose it all. At one point it's a love story that is not going to last long and at the other, it becomes a manifesto of the women of arts.\nAnd then, of course, the ending, HOLY SHIT THE ENDING IS GREAT. Adele Haenel gives more expressions in three minutes than some actors can't even give in an entire film.\n The small details in the movie, the way the two protagonists look at each other,  each smile, the tales told in the movie, the sound, the wind, the fires, all in creating one of the best movie-watching experiences for you.",

The two female leads, Noemie Merlant and Adele Haenel, have remarkable chemistry. Celine Sciamma does a fantastic job directing this movie, getting every little necessary thing needed out of her actors. The plot is simple, a young painter struggles with love while painting another woman. Simple, yet effective. The writing for this movie is subliminal. Every character and moment has a purpose. The film feels very real. It is a beautifully shot movie as well, with some images being beautiful and others seemingly haunting.

This painter lady and the woman fall in love after the painter reveals why she was called there. They hook up a few times while this princess poses for the portrait. They help the house maid with her abortion and attend a kitty party in the middle for some reason. Then when princess's mom comes back and the painter lady has to go, she goes. And for some reason all this is going in flashback?! And then she sees another portrait of the princess lady with her daughter and a vignette of some memory of these two, while in the distance the princess lady cries without even seeing the painter lady. Like, after more than 10 years you are randomly crying and we are to think that's because you miss a romantic encounter you had for 10 days with a hired painter.

Portrait of a lady on fire is a period piece, a window into the lives of affluent French women and a powerful article of social commentary. But beyond the setting, it's the romance between the two leads that stays with you. An era when life was set for women from all strata of society, Marianne and Héloïse made a choice, a strong and decisive one at that. Life is not kind, but between the seemingly endless streams of adversities, there are moments of bliss, odes to joy! Regret not that the moment is gone, but remember and cherish as the world felt beautiful, even if for a fleeting second. Claire Mathon's cinematography was a sight to behold, such a delight moving from frame to frame as if they were painted. The lead pair of Noémie Merlant and Adèle Haenel delivered nearly flawless performances, it's their chemistry that holds the movie together. Luàna Bajrami was charming in her supporting role. Valeria Golino didn't fail to garner the attention her character deserves, albeit in a brief role.

            "content": "Celine Sciamma's extraordinarily sensual, literate romantic lesbian French drama about forbidden love and desire set in 18th century France is unusually understated. Marianne (Noemi Merlant), has been commissioned to paint the portrait of a young woman, Heloise, (Adele Haenel), about to be married to a Milanese nobleman on an isolated island off the majestic, windswept coast of Brittany, France. Heloise refuses to pose for portraits, so Marianne must accompany her as her companion and paint her in secret as she memorizes Heloise's features. Over the course of their brief time together, Heloise agrees to pose for Marianne and they become lovers. Writer-director Sciamma has made a contemporary movie in a period setting without artifice. These two headstrong women appear as contrasts in unexpected ways. Marianne is the daughter of a painter, independent; a modern woman able to move freely in the world. Heloise is the aristocrat, betrothed; a woman recently released from the convent. Sciamma also strikingly contrasts the physical features of these women. The blonde haired, blue eyed Haenel and the dark brown haired, green eyed Merlant look pulchritudinous. Both give exceptional performances. Sciamma makes us conscious that this movie is being told from an explicitly female gaze. She captures the glances, gestures, pauses, and intimacy without being explicit in a manner that is highly erotic. The first time these women kiss is one of the most impassioned embraces in the movies. The final ambiguous shot of Heloise in profile, from Marianne's gaze, during a Vivaldi concert, is devastating. The inclusion of the Greek legend \"Orpheus and Eurydice\" is finely detailed. The peerless cinematography is by Claire Mathon. Exquisite costume design is by Dorothee Guiraud. The haunting music score is by Jean-Baptiste de Laubier and Arthur Simonini. The paintings and sketches are by Helene Delmaire. Won Best Screenplay at the Cannes Film Festival. With Valeria Golina and Luana Bajrami. In French with English subtitles.",

But, I think it would be to the detriment of the film to get lost on its technical aspects. Why? Because Portrait of a Lady does what many \"good\" films never do, it transcends the sum of its parts. To even label the film as a film feels reductionist as Sciamma's masterpiece feels more in common with great literature and poetry than it does with the average movie. But that is the nature of great works of art, they transcend their own medium into something which cannot be labeled or categorized, for it in itself is so transcendent that it defies the notion of genre. So, do yourself a favor, find a way to see this movie, great works of art seldom come about, and even more rarely do they arise from cinema. 5/5.",

There's a deep, rich luxuriousness to the film, from the cinematography to the acting to the story itself, making it ever so deserving of winning the Queer Palm and Best Screenplay award at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe ethereal, hovering camera work evokes the essence of a Terrance Malick film.  Considering Sciamma both wrote and directed ‘Portrait,' her budding career shows no less promise.\n\nNoémie Merlant plays protagonist Marianne, an artist tasked with painting the wedding portrait of Héloïse, played by Adèle Haenel.  Héloïse mustn't know Marianne's true intentions as the bride-to-be is emotionally fraught, having suffered through the recent suicide of her sister along with a stint in a convent.  The notion of being married off to some Milanese nobleman in a sudden and emotionless marriage may simply be too much to bear.\n\nAs the cat-and-mouse interplay unfolds, Marianne and Héloïse bond, creating an emotional connection  flecked with romantic leanings.  It's within this raw passionate atmosphere that the story lingers, offering the audience a meditative mood piece that draws our own emotions into a deep, sensory-rich trance.\n\nThough the pacing of ‘Portrait of a Lady on Fire' is slow, it is necessary to achieve the hypnotic nature of the film.  In capturing this deliberate rhythm, which is essential to the period and plot, Sciamma is able to fully realize the lingering memory of lovers long past into something vibrantly and excitingly new.",

Celine Sciamma thankfully avoided the overdone 'forbidden love' angle and focused instead on the brief but intense love between two women who know their future is not one they can spend together. It could have easily gone the Romeo and Juliet route whereby a suspension of disbelief is necessary to believe the love but Sciamma made us belief from the first moments of these two women meeting that their love was not only true, but cosmically inevitable. Subtle directorial choices, like having Heloise look at Marianne's face instead of her hands stroking the keys of the piano, show their love for one another in a way that dialogue never could. The most striking part of the film is the love felt just through longing glances or body language. Truly a masterful work of acting and directing. It was also one of the most visually stunning films I've seen since Bladerunner 2049. Every shot was simply gorgeous. From the first moments of Marianne on the beach to the rushing waves and vibrant skies that set the backdrop for this ballad of love. The deep and rich metaphors and callbacks in the film, especially to the tale of Eurydice, were simultaneously emotionally rewarding and heart-wrenching. The sparing use of music (I believe only 3 times in the film) was indicative of Sciamma's complete control over her craft and encapsulated the love story in three distinct parts. The first was the first inkling of Heloise's true feelings, the second was the realization of the love betwixt the two, and the third was the overwhelming emotions of a love that would always be there but could not be acted upon any longer. I nearly cried at the final use of music in the film and that is not an easy task. This is my early pick for best film (with a US release) of 2020 and is a true masterpiece of cinema.",

            "content": "Céline Sciamma's \"Portrait of a Lady on Fire\" is an intense, gorgeously shot and mesmerizing portrait of an ill-fated lesbian romance. With her latest feature, French writer/director Céline Sciamma has crafted a powerful film about forbidden love. It is the filmmaker's first attempt at crafting a period piece set in the 1800's. It is not easy to recreate an olden time period, but Sciamma pulls it off seamlessly. Using phenomenal production design, she draws viewers into the lonely life of a portrait painter in the 1800's. The sets, costumes and period details are all perfectly chosen, creating an absorbing film. It is hard to not admire the amazing performances from the cast. Noémie Merlant and Adéle Haenel are incredible in the lead roles, creating a lesbian romance that is utterly believable. Both actresses showcase a knack for conveying emotions through their expressions with minimal dialogue. Although \"Portrait of a Lady on Fire\" is a gorgeous period piece, ultimately it is not a flawless film. At nearly two hours, it is slightly long and suffers from a lengthy running-time. It moves at a slow pace that some viewers may find excruciating to sit through. Due to its slow pace, it is one of those films that may not appeal towards mainstream audiences. Nevertheless, fans of lesbian dramas will definitely enjoy \"Portrait of a Lady on Fire\" and so will movie-goers seeking meaningful entertainment. At a time when lesbian love stories are rarely recognized in Hollywood, it's a rousing reminder that the stories of queer women demand to be told on the big-screen.",

I have often been puzzled by what my subjects are giving me in return by my lens solely focusing on their exterior. I would like to think that my presence made a difference. This movie captures the essence in what I want the answer to be. I fell in love with this story. The different themes are interesting in themselves but the cleverness of the storytelling, cinematography, editing and ACTING, captures you with an early inhale, and does not let go. You already know that if you watch it all over again, you will notice a connection that you missed the first time. This sensation will haunt you as you cling on to every frame, trying not to miss anything which in return, forces you to barley remember to blink. I wanted to see this movie so much I went on my own, on a work trip, with a different subtitle than my own language (luckily being a Scandinavian in another Scandinavian country, I could understand most of it). With my red wine in hand I sat there watching the story unfold while relating to the nostalgia it presented. The loss and the gift of unfulfilled love. This movie will stay with me for a long time and inspired me in ways I thought no movie could. I found myself deeply moved and tears streaming down my face as it came to an end; the two actors executed a mesmerizing performance that I will never forget. This movie is for anyone who enjoy deep meaning, a perplex view on hard questions, and a love story that makes you philosophical. What is the male gaze if you remove the male out of it? What is looking at pure love without the noise and conflict, except the conflict within fighting the nick of time, the inevitable? What will you regret? What will you cherish forever? Someone told me once that you could tell the quality of a wine bottle by reading the etiquette and what it doesn't say. This movie embodies the same principle, and because of that it is a masterpiece.",

It presents us with a thing that we think we know so well and shows it with a different perspective and realize how wrong we were. We realize we knew so little. For me, after I was finished watching it, I was contemplating on the life of that bygone era. Were the people of that time happier than us? Did they knew love better than us? Sure they had problems. There was nothing much to do and were probably bored most of the time. But they were really really happy it seems. In this modern era, we have forgotten how to love. We are more connected than ever by technology and yet we are so disconnected emotionally.\n\nThe acting, direction, costumes and cinematography were all topnotch. ‘Parasite' actually opened the floodgates of foreign films for me, with it being the first and this being the second. I realized there is so much more to cinema than Hollywood.\nMy mind has been opened and I have learned to see love from a new perspective. I will finish with a quote from Sophie Monks Kaufman (Empire). It goes like this, she says, \"There are theme-park rides; there is cinema; there are sacred love poems to take with you for the rest of your life. Thank you for giving us the last one, Céline Sciamma.\"\n\nI am a changed man after watching this film. That about the highest compliment I can give for a film.",

You might not like this one 💁\nThis film is pretty expertly crafted. In the same way a movie like the shinning uses long takes and strange close ups to build horror tension, this movie does to build sexual tension. Director Celine Sciamma does really interesting thing with framing and editing that make it so that you never look at the places in the scene that are most interesting, it's always fixed on faces. And it works to great result in just building this slow, hesitatant film that is almost ashamed of looking at anything other that the characters in the eye. Which I think is a deliberate choice in that it mirrors how the characters must be feeling.\nOn that note... Mirrors are a big motif in this movie. And so are images, painting and how we see someone. They give a lot of dialogue in the second half in not looking away and to see things for what they are.\nThe camera never pulls away either with every shot being long and arduous. It rejects action and excitement and it is very fast to cut away from big drama and action. Which is a direct rejection of the literary \"male gaze\" style within film making.\nThat being said, it's a movie thats made to be long and boring. It takes more than its time to tell a very simple story of love. If they idea of na excellently constructed lesbian love afair that takes 2 hours to get to the affair part doesn't sound interesting to you... You probably won't have a blast watching. But I would highly recommend checking it out if you can hunt it down if you do want to be exposed to that.",

Héloïse was called home from a convent to step into an arranged bride-to-be lineup because her older sister stepped off a cliff rather than be given away in matchmaker’s nuptials. Héloïse’s mother, La Comtesse (Valeria Golino) needs a portrait for the Milanese nobleman who is now considering marrying her second daughter. Ironically termed the Age of Enlightenment, marriages of the nobility in this era were finalized via life size painted portraits delivered for review to the potential suitor. Defiant, strong willed Héloïse isn’t having it. No portrait, no wedding. This is where Marianne comes in. No portrait, no commission. Rounding out the all female cast, a third young woman, Sophie (Luàna Bajrami), the house maid is befriended by Marianne and Héloïse and when Sophie gets pregnant, in solidarity they accompany her to the village to get an abortion. Personal female power and choices are exercised despite living in an era of negligible to no options for women. The film’s powerful ending—of enduring yet unrequited love, contained in requisite yet intolerable cultural norms—is as understandable as it is unfathomable. The story’s resolution will linger long after you’ve left the theater. There is no tragedy here but there is an empty ache for more, more of what simply can’t be. It’s not a spoiler to disclose that Marianne gets her commission, the mother-daughter arranged marriage plot is simply a period piece vehicle for the mysterious, erotic, forbidden fruit romance to emerge between Marianne and Héloïse. Their mutual attraction so sensual, so exquisitely luxurious that this love story is already mentioned as one of the best 100 movies of the decade, indeed a masterpiece. The cinematography is beyond stunning with an intoxicating palate of colors framing every scene. Art and literature merge as readings from Ovid’s version of Orpheus and Eurydice foreshadow a poignant, heartbreaking exchange between the lesbian lovers. The music is electrifying, euphoric. The third movement of “Summer” from Vivaldi’s “Four Seasons” plaintively ties together the hope and hopelessness of taboo love. A late night bonfire gathering of island women transcends into a haunting, masterful choral number of Latin chants, “fugere non possum,” “I cannot flee” and “Nos resurgemus,” “We rise.” It’s a shame that France submitted Les Misérables for the Academy’s Best International Film category because Writer/Director Céline Sciamma’s Portrait of a Lady On Fire would have certainly challenged Parasite for Best Picture. Aside from a few jarring male appearances, the cast consists entirely of women and was written, directed and filmed by women. Nos resurgemus. We rise.",

This, in my opinion, is a beautiful, sensitive story that happens also to be a lesbian love story and in p[art an awakening where it evolves and ends but never ends.  I thought it was brilliant.

There is no music to set the mood, except at the very end.  The tension is soley by the looks of the two women and their minimal dialogue.

The best part about this film is how it is shot. It's a movie where the plot centers around a painting yet it also looks as colorful as one. The two lead actresses do a great job and show so much emotion with minimal dialogue and powerful yet simple facial expressions. My main complaint about the movie is that is has a very slow pace in its first half. Despite looking beautiful, the movie took a while before it truly grabbed my interest. However, the second half of the film definitely picked up and by the time it ended, I definitely felt a lot of emotional weight for the characters. There also are a good amount of social topics that I could discuss in the movie. In fact, there is one subplot in the movie that felt profound but also felt a bit out of place with the main story. Overall, this is a film that has visually stunning camerawork and memorable performances that overshadow some of the pacing issues.",

The film is beautifully staged and crafted, the performances by the entirely female cast are emotional and believable, and I loved the films complete lack of musical score. The quiet moments, such as pauses in conversation, allow you to absorb everything that is happening, or not happening, since there are no distractions. It makes the intimate moments feel more realistic, with no violins or pianos to try and hammer the points home. Unfortunately, the films pacing makes it difficult to be fully engaged by, and more often than not feels like a way to make some of the scene feel longer for no good reason. The lesbian love affair was covered with more drama and poignancy in Blue Is The Warmest Colour, which, despite being an entire hour longer, managed to hold the audience's attention much better. It's a stylish film, and one with a lot of merit, but I can't see those outside of the arthouse scene having many great things to say about it.",

This movie looks absolutely glorious, and as far as I'm concerned, Céline Sciamma has produced one of the most gorgeous looking films of 2019. The film is shot in 8K, and for that particular reason, it looks absolutely incredible. Due to using 8K, the colors leap from the screen, and I was immersed by this. I think Adèle Haenel did an amazing job as Héloïse, but Noémie Merlant? She was stunning in the lead role, and I believe she gave one of the best performances of 2019. I really cared about her character (Marianne), and I was constantly riveted by her performance. The story is (almost) constantly engaging, and I thought this was wildly original. The way the story is told, and the way the films is written make this a very interesting watch. I did find myself bored a few times, and I've heard people praising this as a masterpiece. I'm not quite there, although I do think this was snubbed for Best International Feature at the 92nd Academy Awards. My only real issue with the film is that I'm not likely to rewatch this. This is a personal gripe, but I think being able to rewatch a film is pretty big criteria. Even though I still think it's a great film, I'm not yearning to go back and watch it. Regardless, I think this is an amazing film with gorgeous cinematography and color, a beautiful story, and fantastic performances. This is a film that I predict a lot of people will think is boring and slow; shockingly, I loved it.",

            "content": "Esto También Es.- La directora Céline Sciamma retrata exquisitamente la novela clásica de Henry James, \"Retratos de una mujer en llamas\" , donde la libertad, amor y obsesión nos llevan al siglo XVIII demostrando nuevas aristas del estilo clásico.\n\nEstamos en el año 1770, Un par de décadas antes de la Revolución Francesa, donde Marianne (Noemie Merlant), una prominente artista llega a una isla remota en la costa de Bretaña.\nCuando al fin llega a la morada de su nueva cliente, la recibe La Condesa (Valeria Golino). Ella explica que debe pintar a su hija Heloise (Adele Haenel), quien acaba de salir de un convento y se ha sumergido en una depresión. La obra debe hacerse sin el conocimiento de la bella joven visto que, al terminar el trabajo, estará lista para contraer nupcias con un desconocido pretendiente en Milán. La única ayuda cómplice llega con Sophie (Luàna Bajrami), la criada de la casa.\nEl trabajo supone varios retos adicionales para Merlant. Entre sus lienzos replica los cuerpos de mujeres de acuerdo a la percepción de sus ojos, pero en esta oportunidad debe tener una memoria fotográfica con Heloise para quien funge como dama de compañía.\n\nEl siguiente reto de Merlant es conseguir emoción en su obra. La solitaria Heloise consiente de su destino, no es precisamente una mujer muy expresiva por cuanto la artista deberá descubrir esta noble entre líneas.\n\nMarianne es oscura y reprimida mientras que Heloise es volátil y justa, pero el contraste visual entre ellas va mucho más allá. En cierto sentido, todo el drama de la película está en la diferencia entre los delgados labios de Merlant y los llenos de Haenel, y en espera del momento que cerrará la brecha.\n\nHay un lado de cuento de hadas en la tarea de Marianne e igualmente en el entorno: un castillo oscuro, chirriante, casi desierto junto al mar. Asimismo, algo de mitología se deja colar con la discusión sobre el mito de Orfeo y Eurídice. Por último, hay un elemento gótico en esta premisa: nos enteramos de que Heloise tenía una hermana y que no hace mucho tiempo se lanzó al precipicio, tal vez por suicidio. Pero todo esto es periférico a propósito principal del Retrato de una mujer en llamas, que es mostrar a Marianne y Heloise acercándose, casi sin saberlo en una mirada femenina de conocimiento, miedo y, ultimadamente de éxtasis erótico.\n\nAhora que estamos en tiempos donde el cine se empeña en alterar la historia en aras de ser políticamente correcto, Sciamma sorprende gratamente redescubriendo nada menos que el estilo clásico siendo respetuosa del género, la historia y la época. Aun así, allí está la presencia del realismo social contemporáneo presente, tal como lo hizo anteriormente con Girlhood y Tomboy.\n\nLo Mejor: El guión es una joya con sello literalmente personal de Céline Sciamma quien escribe y dirige una historia con destellos de su vida personal.\nLo Malo: El tiempo que se toma la cinta en descubrir sus personajes tal vez pudo ¿o haberse acortado, en todo caso en la soledad de este juego de ajedrez, cada reina juega sus mejores piezas.",

            "content": "As time marches on, fewer and fewer of us remember what life was like before the internet. Those of us who were around back then can attest to the fact that American life was quite a bit more slow-paced. There was still media bombardment, in albeit a subtler way, but one could avoid cultural desensitization and the resultant ennui much more easily if they wished. I suppose one of the biggest differences was that people were naturally a little more physically active and could concentrate for longer amounts of time. Experiences seemed to mean more because every moment and accomplishment wasn't immediately set in the context of a global existence. Maybe it was a little more solipsistic or maybe just unfettered by the full scope of reality. Myopic and fractured as the current socio-political, cultural, or spiritual experience can be today, the Information Age blasted an LED spotlight on every secret garden or Walden and made sure there was a trash can and toilet to accommodate all of the unsanctimonious tourists disrupting the quietude with their camera apps unmuted, and so it seems there aren't so many sacred spaces left to hide in anymore.\n\nPerhaps that's why we watch, say, a French period-set romance film like PORTRAIT OF A LADY ON FIRE. Something deep in our individual DNA or collective subconscious knows that stillness is good for us. I remember a time long ago when I admonished a friend of mine for excitedly telling me he was going to see the latest TRANSFORMERS flick, he responded by telling me a refrain we've all heard many times before: \"I work hard all day, my life is in shambles, and please...for once, FOR ONCE can I PLEASE just go out for a nice night at the movies, buy some popcorn and a coke, and just...shut my brain off? If I could turn back time and ask him some loaded rhetorical questions in response, they would be: Do you practice zen meditation at a D'n'B rave? Do you smoke PCP during a poker match? Do you blow up your house while gardening? As P-Funk used to say, \"If you don't like the effects, don't produce the cause.\"\n\nJust take a minute if you have it to imagine the world before television, films, automobiles, and phones. It must have been incredibly boring by you or I's standards, but if humans are exceedingly talented at anything it would be in finding ways to keep ourselves amused. We would probably play card games, make a hallucinogenic poultice, sing, master painting, or fall in love with a member of our own gender. Now just imagine if you were a woman, considered property or soon-to-be property, with absolutely no rights except those afforded by your social status. Imagine how boring life would be, subject to the whims and wills of men who live a city, a country, or a world away from you. Sounds like a decent starting point for a sensuous, existential narrative fiction analysis of the female psyche that transcends ideological bounds and probes the deepest recesses of emotion and aesthetics.\n\nIt seems so easy to romanticize or fetishize PORTRAIT OF A LADY ON FIRE not just because it fits the bill of a meditative work with all of the necessary components needed to wow an audience at Cannes, but because it is a terribly romantic work that fetishizes its own period production, actresses, and philosophical weight. I couldn't and wouldn't look away from the stark, perfectly framed/lit/acted/coded shots of actresses Noémie Merlant (Marianne) and Adèle Haenel (Héloïse) for a second, pathetically wishing I could watch their world far past the film's run time. It seems easy to cynically call the movie another idyllic trip through a progressive past that never occurred, but who need's that noise? I've been fortunate enought to find a small crack in reality where divine light shines through and blights my face with cold excitement. This movie is a portal into a world where books, paintings, modest baroque architecture, and the unstoppable forces of nature converge to give you that stillness that you lack in your day to day life. \n\nMarianne and Héloïse, for a brief moment, exist in a microcosm of divine feminine magic where they make the rules and enjoy the fruits of their labor. Yes, they bicker; yes, time is running out for them; yes, life laps them in bounds as they seek meaning and try to latch onto something they don't even know exists yet. This is the horrific beauty of cinematic truth - that the objects, the people, the essences, and the hopes that we fixate upon become ourselves in the quiet course of tragedy. If we weren't guarded by the manic principles of nihilism, we would be overwhelmed with feeling anytime we heard a song. Not in some brobdignagian, nuclear explosion of thought, word, and deed, but in this stillness that our species has forgotten. In the dark flourescent light of you computer screen or phone, open your vocal chords and break the silence of your aching soul, then listen to the beautiful, joyful hush that follows it.",

It's a film that really can't be compared to others, it's a unique and breathtaking piece of cinema. It's a love story. It's a feminist doctrine. It's a Renaissance painting. Written and directed by French director Celine Sciamma, the film won Best Screenplay at Cannes and rightly so. Set in remote Brittany in 18th Century France this film is certainly not your typical period piece. It tells, with great emotional honesty, the love affair between Marianne and Heloise. Marianne is an artist commissioned to paint Heloise on the eve of her wedding. Heloise has already sent away a previous painter so her mother tells her Marianne is purely a walking companion. Secretly Marianne is painting her at night in her absence. Eventually a strong bond of love is formed between the two women. The film does an excellent job of not only portraying their love, but also displaying their inner strength as women. It does it all in such a starkly beautiful way that it overflows with quiet emotion. The chemistry between the two women is tactile, a credit to the superb actresses. Sciamma is superb too in her directing, each frame is exquisitely set up. So the film is not only extremely pleasing to the eye but joyous to the heart.",

Marianne (Merlant) has arrived in the guise of an attendant to daughter of aristocracy Héloïse (Haenel), who has insisted to her countess mother (a splendid Valeria Golino) that she will never pose. Fine! Marianne will simply stare at her over the course of her time in the household and paint secretly at night — secrets are so much more fun anyway. Marianne's observer's eye and the predatory nature of her duty contribute to the feeling that her relationship with Héloïse is unfolding like a game of cat and mouse. When the cat finally eats the mouse, it's a \"Desert Hearts\" (1985)-level release. Most miraculously, Sciamma manages to keep this visual chess game going at a pleasingly glacial pace for two solid hours, and always shoots it minimalistically, which complements its soulful quality. Shockingly, the film was not put forth by France for Oscar consideration as Best International Feature Film; the fine \"Les Misérables\" will have that honor. Hopefully,\"Lady\" will slide into some other mentions — maybe even Best Director, Best Actress and/or Best Picture.",

            "content": "Set in 1760 on a remote island, Marianne (Noemie Merlant) is commissioned to paint the portrait of Heloise (Adele Haenel) for the purpose of snagging her a husband. Heloise had been planning to become a nun but her family pulled her from the convent once she became their only living daughter, a.k.a. hope for the family to secure prosperity through marriage. Marianne must hide her true intentions and grow close to her subject, memorizing her face enough to paint it in secret. An intimacy builds between the two women that will change both of their lives even long after the fateful painting is finished (spoilers?).\n\nWriter/director Celine Sciamma has primarily worked with contemporary stories (Girlhood, Tomboy, Water Lilies) but, in stepping back in time, she has tapped into something elementally beautiful and poignant. It is very much a slow-burn of a movie but, in essence, that is the most relatable form of love, a feeling that builds, transforms, and can eventually consume. There's a liberation for the characters in the time they share together, first as companions and then as lovers. This is a transitory time, one locked in isolation and free from men, though the presence of the patriarchy is unavoidable as it limits their life choices. For Heloise, she had no desire to become someone's wife and then it was no longer her choice. Her greatest value lies in marriage, and a portrait during this era was essentially someone's dating profile picture. It's on Marianne to paint an accurate depiction that can ensnare this woman a husband, which gets even more complicated when Marianne falls for her. The movie tenderly moves along with guarded caution, as two women explore their feelings for one another in a time that didn't care about their feelings. This is a love story that feels alive but also realistic in how it forms and develops. It's about halfway through the movie before the ladies finally make their intentions known. I can understand why this might be too slow for many viewers but the movie never came across as dull for me, and it's because I was so drawn into this world, these characters, and their yearnings being unleashed.\n\nWhen it comes to movies exemplifying the difference in the female gaze, allow Portrait of a Lady on Fire to be one of the prime examples. This is miles away from the crass objectification featured in the likes of Michael Bay's oeuvre and his very explicit definition of sexy. This is a movie where the only nudity casually happens after the sex (and body hair isn't a big deal). There's more ASMR action for the senses (lots of loud lip-smacking sound design) than ogling naked bodies. The emphasis isn't on the contours of lithe feminine forms but more on the emotional and physical impact of a person as a whole. There's one scene that is tremendously affecting and quite sexy, and it begins with the painter telling her subject every small physical response she has studied while painting her. It's little observations that are romantically relayed. The subject then turns around and says, \"Who do you think I've been looking at as I've posed for hours?\" and proceeds to unfurl her own richly earned romantic observations about her painter's physical responses. It's such a wonderful scene bristling with palpable sexual tension and infatuation, so much more being said in glances than in declarative speeches. The movie also opens up a larger discussion of the male gaze as it pertains to the world of art. They must play into the established conventions driven by a rigid patriarchy designating how women are best represented in media, and the implications to modern cinematic portraits are clearly felt. Funny enough, Heloise is chastised for not smiling enough in her portraits to woo a worthwhile suitor.\n\nI assumed this love story wasn't going to have a happy ending given the confines of its era, but I want every reader to know that Portrait of a Lady on Fire just absolutely crushes its ending. You may expect it coming, in a general sense, but the resolution to this love story floored me. There are two consecutive scenes that each elicit different emotions. The first is a winsome feeling of being remembered, of having a sense of permanence after the fact, of a moment in time that will long be fondly recalled and celebrated for its fleeting perfection and lifelong significance. Then the next scene involves a payoff of great empathy that almost brought tears to my eyes. It delivers a long-desired payoff to a character's lifelong request, and the camera simply holds for over a minute while we watch the indescribable impression this woman is experiencing. It's so joyous, so heartfelt, and so luxuriously earned that I felt like my heart was going to burst. The fact that both of these emotional conclusions happen without a single word being uttered is even more impressive.\n\nThe acting from the leads is phenomenal and the nuances they navigate are so precise and subtle. This isn't a movie about grand gestures and big dialogue exchanges. It's a romance in that genteel fashion of furtive movements and words encased in subtext. We've seen this kind of restrained love story before in other period pieces, as well as gay cinema with its socially forbidden love. The intimacy between these two women must start slow and, like a fire, be given the right amount of oxygen to allow it to spread. There's an understandable bitterness that this love will not be allowed but this cannot abate the desire to proceed anyway. These women are more than just tragic figures coming into one another's orbit. They're fleshed-out and multi-dimensional characters with their own goals and imperfections. They feel like real people, and while disappointed by their limitations within a patriarchy, they will continue to pursue their personal dreams. The portrayal is so empathetic that your heart can't help but ache when it isn't swooning from the sumptuously understated romance of it all.\n\nAn intimately felt and intimately developed forbidden love that feels natural, nuanced, and enormously engaging. It reminds us that movies only need compelling characters or a compelling scenario to grab us good. I'm fairly certain Bay's music licensing budget was more than this French indie. Portrait of a Lady on Fire isn't a revolutionary movie. We've seen variations on this story before, but what makes it unmissable is the degree of feeling and artistry crammed into every breathable moment. I know there's an ample audience that will enjoy 6 Underground, especially with its wider availability, and that's fine. Netflix paid a pretty penny betting there are enough people looking for the film equivalent of a drunken, disheveled one-night stand. If you're looking for something more authentic, deeply felt, and, let's face it, generous to women, then look for Portrait of a Lady on Fire, a beautiful indie romance that warmed my heart, broke it, and then fastened it back together.\n\nNate's Grade: A",

            "content": "Men have been looking at women in films since the very beginnings of mainstream moviemaking, but only in recent decades have we seen the opposite.  Of course, queer cinema has very much flipped the script on this notion, making the looks given between the same sexes into a veritable trope of its own. Now with the remarkable, masterful Portrait Of A Lady On Fire, the gaze not only illuminates the seen but the seer as well.  With such a deceptively simple premise and very spare dialogue, this gorgeously shot film achieves unforgettable levels of complexity and feelings.  Take that, queer tropes!\n\nWriter/director Céline Sciamma (Tomboy), sets her film in late 18th century France.  Marianne (Noémie Merlant ), a painter, receives a commission from La Comtesse (Rain Man's Valeria Golino). She's hired to create a portrait of La Comtesse's daughter Héloïse (Adèle Haenel ) to entice an Italian suitor.  Héloïse has recently found herself kicked out of a convent for mysterious reasons and now lives at home with her mother and their chambermaid Sophie (Luana Bajrami ).  Emotionally frail, Héloïse has also lost a sister to an apparent suicide and refuses to sit for a painting.  Marianne must study her subject on their daily walks and paint her secretly at night entirely from memory.  \n\nWithout an incredible filmmaker, this storyline may appear routine, but Sciamma has the visual language skills to create great tension and beauty out of people gazing at each other.  An early scene of our two leads walking along an oceanside cliff strikes gold every time Héloïse turns around to notice Marianne studying her.  We feel an artist sizing up her subject as much as we feel the sexual attraction beginning to blossom. Sciamma also holds out a stunning surprise later on with regard to those looks.  This reveal turns an already beautiful love story into something far more profound.  \n\nSciamma also plays with gender identity quite a bit, with Marianne's first pass at the portrait giving Héloïse a more traditionally masculine countenance.  Despite her big, billowy skirts, Marianne also leans into more male traits such as her strong jawline and penchant for smoking pipes.  Unshaved armpits may have been the norm at the time, but it also enhances Sciamma's premise even more.  \n\nThroughout the film, we experience the artist's painstaking process, basically tearing up each draft until she captures Héloïse's essence.  As their love grows, so do Marianne's skills.  In the second act, circumstances leave the pair alone with Sophie, who faces an extreme challenge of her own.  Free from the strict rules of society, this trio laughs, drinks, plays games and in a great scene, attend an all-female ritual which leads to the image in the title.  The title, however, applies to all three of our heroines, who, when given the chance to be themselves, burn with ferocity.  It's a distinctly feminist point of view with the added grace of humanism.  \n\nA lesser director would have pushed their ideas to the fore more than their characters, but Sciamma clearly understands that the personal is political.  We grow to love these women because they refuse to succumb to Hallmark sentiments.  Sciamma and her extremely talented cinematographer, Claire Mathon (Stranger By The Lake, another queer classic), favor austerity with occasional bursts of color to establish the film's bleak mood.  Much of the movie lives in the gorgeous candle light and stark framing.  Characters have been established so well, that when we see our main trio of women walking outside at dusk in exquisite silhouette, we know exactly who is who.  Production Designer Thomas Grézaud understands the contained Manor should feel like a prison at times and an oasis at others.  The craftsmanship and control of tone reminded me in parts of Michael Haneke's White Ribbon and Jane Campion's The Piano, with a little bit of Bergman's Persona thrown in there for good measure.   It's a heady combination, but Sciamma feels ready to play with the other auteurs. \n\nAll of this comes together to support its stunning cast.  While Golino and Bajrami contribute perfectly realized performances, Merlant and Hanel bring their story to aching life.  Merlant has the rare ability to allow us to see clear through her icy exterior, and when she finally cracks a smile, we melt along with her.  Hanel, who delivered strong work in BPM (Beats Per Minute), has the tough assignment of making us care for this upper class, somewhat charmless woman.  One of the great pleasures of the film comes when Héloïse steps more and more into the world of \"the help\" to discover who she is and what she truly wants.  Art, as always, is the great leveler.  Of course, true equality for queer people did not exist in the 1700s, so it would feel disingenuous to assign a happy ending here.  What we get instead leads to a final shot of such raw emotion and power, we can't help but think of Portrait Of A Lady On Fire as a magnificent work of art.",

It is a slowly paced movie that impels its audience to soak in its subtleties, realise its pinpoint characterisation work throughout and to completely lose yourself in the impeccable performances of the two female leads. In fact, the sheer power of this love story is at first elicited and then amplified by many of its subtleties and intrinsic elements, which produce a handful of truly breathtaking and utterly memorable scenes. Even certain lines of dialogue written and spoken at times have this same effect.\n\nThe themes to be derived from the film's narrative is something I feel is a little more open to individual interpretation. It is a love story that has the word forbidden painted all over it, but isn't a theme on writer and director Céline Sciamma's palette to explore at all really. Before and while the romance was developing, PORTRAIT OF A LADY ON FIRE had me more focused on identifying each character's motivations and absorbing the boundaries to their varying degrees of freedom. Equality and vulnerability are a couple of others that I observed throughout and can mention without hinting towards a spoiler. The rest, I shall leave for you to discover in this exquisite and excellent film.",

The lesbian story, while a taboo, didn't have any risks associated with it. At the end of the day, filmmakers needs to realize that conflict needs more depth and just showing sex, doesn't mean love.

            "content": "Recommendation: Films don't often invite us in, but Portrait Of A Lady On Fire opens up and swallows us whole. Words like strong, cinematic, and beautiful don't do it justice. 9.5/10.\n\nPortrait Of A Lady On Fire is one of the most moving and exceptional works of cinema to be released in years. Full stop. Written and directed by Céline Sciamma, the French-language film is gorgeous in every sense of the word. The cinematography is a feast for the senses (as heralded by the LAFCA & NYFCC), subtle, lived in, nuanced performances from the co-leads build the audience up, and the devastating final scene conveys more than entire films do in their entire runtime. Portrait Of A Lady On Fire is a testament to the power of filmmaking's ability to wholly engross, engage and uplift.\n\nSet in the 18th century, Portrait Of A Lady On Fire follows painter Marianne (Noémie Merlant) who travels to a remote island in Brittany, France to paint a wedding portrait of Héloïse (Adèle Haenel). The former must paint without the latter knowing. Described as a \"walking companion,\" Marianne doesn't accompany so much as she observes Héloïse so that she may paint her portrait in secret at night. But there's no connection—no life—in the portrait and Marianne sabotages her own work.\n\nGranted five days to paint another, Marianne is magnetically pulled toward Héloïse. Fate would have it that the opposite was true, and in the cat-and-mouse game of forbidden attraction, the two are absorbed by the one another—ultimately giving in to desire. As Héloïse is set to be married in mere weeks, the forbidden love has an impending expiry, making the flames of connection burn brighter, the knowledge it will extinguish soon adding fuel to the fire.\n\nA story of forbidden love in unforgiving times is hardly new, but the film crackles because of the moments between Marianne and Héloïse. Firstly, cautious intrigue over a Vivaldi piano session, stolen glances on the walkabouts, poring over one another in painting sessions… looks during a bonfire celebration. Their bond is able to grow purely and organically due to the relative isolation of the island, where the camera catches all of the intimate moments, feeling exceptionally personal and real. Sketching a sleeping Héloïse by firelight, pontificating on Orpheus and Eurydice over wine, supporting the maid—physically and mentally—through her abortion… It's a whirlwind romance, but it's so much more. It's a bond between two close souls that both know it cannot last.\n\nBy film's end the women are split, forced to lead separate lives by the cold circumstance of 18th century bourgeois existence. Portrait Of A Lady On Fire embodies the adage \"it is better to have loved and lost than it is to have never loved at all.\" But this isn't a fleeting romance. At the conclusion the audience sees how both women's lives—although divergent—have been impacted by their time together. The final shot is devastating. The entirety of the relationship—wants, needs, desires, flaws, insecurities, companionship—is summed up in Héloïse's reaction to a Vivaldi piece that sparked their romance so many years ago. It's a stunning and refreshing reminder. An encapsulation of a moment in time, that these two women will be inexorably linked for life, never free from each other's gravity, no matter the circumstance.",

Marianne has to keep her reason for being there a secret, so she comes in the guise of being Heloise's companion. Heloise has no experience with love, or music, or the arts. The film is about the slowly evolving friendship that develops between the two. This is one of the most visually beautiful films I have seen this year. The camerawork is phenomenal; every scene is carefully crafted and could be its own painting. The screenplay is quite amazing, and it is beautiful to watch the friendship between the three women in the house evolve slowly against the backdrop of an era when women were considered to be merely property and were not deemed to have any merits of their own. It is an art film that is about art, and about women, and about beauty and creativity. Everything they do is an act of transgression, and I absolutely loved being mesmerized by the world the women created between themselves.
