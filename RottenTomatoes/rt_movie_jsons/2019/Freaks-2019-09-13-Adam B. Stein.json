            "content": "Freaks (2018) is a North American science fiction thriller written and directed by Zach Lipovsky and Adam B. Stein.  The main characters of the film are Chloe aka Eleanor Reed (Lexy Kolker), Chloe's Dad, Henry Lewis (Emile Hirsch), Mr. Snowcone (Bruce Dern), Mary (Amanda Crew),  and Agent Ray (Grace Park).\nA sweet and delightful seven year old girl escapes her deranged and disturbed father's clutches who has filled her mind with paranoia and fear, and hops a ride with Mr. Snowcone, the ice cream man, who convinces her to take a ride.  Until she flees the house, Chloe has never been outside her house.  Her father has convinced her that it isn't safe and she would be in mortal danger if she left and that she would be killed.  There is something deeply troubling and disturbing about the father/daughter relationship, and Henry's parenting skills.  Meanwhile, Mr. Snowcone has secretly left Chloe little gifts in an attempt to lure her away.  It's a film where paranoia meets reality seen through the eyes of a child and where an altered reality is juxtaposed with the real.  Is the father really paranoid?  What is his motivation to isolate Chloe from the outside world?  What about Mr. Snowcone?   Is Mr. Snowcone really a good Samaritan?   Is he really an ice cream man?  Why is he so interested in Chloe?  How does he know her name?  Is he a pedophile?  Once out of the house and in Mr. Snowcone's ice cream truck, Chloe's journey begins and boy, is she in for an adventure.  Is she really at risk?  Why does Chloe disobey her father?   The film sets up many intriguing questions whose answers are revealed in the narrative of the film which grows in complexity and madness.\nBesides being a science fiction thriller, it's really a coming of age film for a special, precocious little girl who has a mind of her with incredible powers who seeks a normal life and a mommy.  She has many new experiences on her own without her father's interference and becomes her own little person. \nA good film is not without its villains and in Freaks there are several.  The film is situated within a post-modern, out of kilter world, where freaks/the abnormals have disturbed the social order.  The film shocks and there are many disturbing scenes.    The  disturbing behaviour of Chloe's Dad, Mr. Snowcone, the police, Agent Ray, and Chloe herself run as a motif throughout the film stitching it into a cohesive structure.\nThe directors have woven together many visual elements to create a science fiction thriller that will leave you in suspense as more of Chloe's backstory and that of the main characters are revealed.   The juxtaposition of the real with an altered reality is compelling and adds to the dramatic tension of the film.    If you want to find out what happens to Chloe, then, well, you've got to see the film which is engaging and will hold your attention.\nThe directors juxtapose Chloe's story against the simmering tensions amongst the characters which fuels the dramatic tension in the film.  Hirsch shines as the disturbed and deranged father with a heart of gold who will do anything to protect his daughter.  Dern is marvelous to watch as Mr. Snowcone who is equally aggressive and abusive towards Chloe who intentions are to use her as a pawn to rescue his own daughter who is being held captive in an underground camp deep within the bowels of a mountain.   Kolker (Chloe), Hirsch and Dern have chemistry and are interesting to watch as they play off each other, together or separately. The piece de la resistance is Kolker who is phenomenal in her role as the precocious seven year old coming into her own. \nThe film resonated with me on a personal level posing important philosophical and existential questions such as the importance of minority rights and diversity.   It shines a light on the pathology of a dominant society which will go to extraordinary lengths to rid itself of differences evoking the horrors of Nazi Germany.  It's an intriguing film shining a light on the pathology of ideological thought that fails to consider humanity in all its diversity.  It was a compelling film to watch and, I don't think I'll ever be able look at an ice cream truck in the same way again.",

But then the story started to come together in a big way and I would say a good way. \nYou learn more about each of the \"Freaks\" special abilities and although it kinda feels like elements of the movie have been done before in other films, it is still very enjoyable to watch as the over development was delivered in a fresh way, I was glued to the screen. \n\nSome good acting in this little gem especially from the little girl which I thought got better throughout this film. \nI do enjoy watching really good low budget films and I think this film potentially warrants a sequel finale. \n5 Stars from me",

This film is creative genius at it's best, using inspiration from many of the best genre media to date to craft together a beautifully moving modern, dystopian fairy tale. The confidence in the direction is next level, as Adam B Stein help bring to life these very believable characters which are not confined to any moral archetypal standards. Their journey feels very personal and their motivations are completely realized, in part due to the magnificent acting of the entire cast. The way in which the film blends and transforms it's genre is another journey in itself, which makes the experience in watching this film one of the best you can hope for. Mainstream American Hollywood can get very hung up on having no grey, moral ambiguity about it's characters. But smaller, independent films such as these prove that the key in making a relatable, enthralling, cinematic presentation is in the overall relatability of the characters and their relationships between each other.\n\nSome on this website have criticized the slow pacing at the beginning of the film. Slow compared to what? The MCU? I myself noted that the film really takes off right around 30mins. How demanding of an audience member do you have to be, to expect to be immediately entertained in a manner in which only you desire, before even 30mins into a feature-length film. Get real. The 1st act is crucial in setting up the world in which Chloe lives in and is told from her perspective so that we can understand her and become invested in her. I guess some people wanted more explosions? The whole plot is very easy to follow and straight-forward. Unless you may have forgotten to take your medication.\n\nAnd yet another negative review talks about how the restraints of the budget directly affected the effectiveness of the storytelling. What world do we now live in, where slow-motion CGI, extensive practical and visual effects, and elaborate sets, are now just not enough?? Get real! If anything, the lack of multi-million-dollar-5-second-shots simply helps propel the characterizations and gritty writing even more. Is everything now to be compared to the shallow eye-candy thrills of the MCU??\n\nAnd finally, as if to prove my point, one astute reviewer claims that this is simply an X-men film rip-off. Get freaking real!! As if any story which involves supernatural abilities is copyrighted by Marvel now. Plus, didn't The Boys already prove that there is no monopoly on compelling stories about individuals with superpowers? I tell you the truth, there is more character development and raw emotion in these 105 minutes than in every X-men film combined.\n\nBasically, if your film repertoire expands beyond the pea-sized Marvel Cinematic Universe, you'll at the very least enjoy this film and not regret having experienced it. Take that, Dark Phoenix.",

I really do not get how anyone could have enjoyed this. Not only is the story line lame, but it's slow and boring. The acting is bad (although the kid is pretty good for her age) the FX isn't even worth watching. They try to feed you a long drawn out confusing storyline until more than halfway then they start to let you in on what's happening (most of which I guessed anyway). Then after they let you in on the mysterious \"big secret\" it gets no better.  I finally had to fast forward through it hoping it might improve, but it never did.

Indeed, it may be these directors who display the true superhuman abilities given the film was created on a budget of $2,000 (and lots of favors).  Just compare that to Marvel's latest hundred million dollar budget blockbuster.  And yet Freaks never feels low-budget or small.  Instead the world is intriguing and the superpowers are epic.

That mystery going into this film quite honestly makes it that much better.

At least the cinematography was good, but I've forgotten what the soundtrack was like so it can't have been anything special. The film was so confusing that it did remain somewhat engaging, but it's a below average sci-fi. No idea how it got put in the category of 'horror' as there's nothing scary or disturbing in this film. It's a low budget sci-fi action film with a weird plot.",

The role of Chloe (played by Lexy Kolker) is magnificently done! such a young and talented actress deserves to be recognised. She carried her role and the story throughout!

Its low-budget is a testament to the writing, acting, and plot — how low, I was unable to find, and I cannot believe it was only $2,000. Most importantly, the film keeps you engaged as the plot releases pieces of information that you begin to place into a puzzle to create context. The one-sentence tease on my TV was barely enough for me to click-on it — the Emile Hirsch casting put it on my watch-list. Like all children in dystopian/post-apocalyptic movies, Chloe (Lexy Kolker) can't seem to follow instructions meant to protect her. Unlike (most) children in dystopian/post-apocalyptic movies, Chloe has… powers. The film is only a couple of years old and not well-known, so I'm going to refrain from spoilers, but the concept of the \"crazies\" or \"abnormals\" and how to tell them apart from \"us\", the ADF (think Sci-Fi ICE, but more murdery), and Madoc Mountain — a super-max torture-prison that could be a little more well-guarded — create a futuristic society that doesn't seem too farfetched from where we're headed. Of course, without the superpowers. While it has obvious political messaging, it doesn't come off as preachy, unlike (late) Black Mirror. Freaks is yet another excellent example of indie films doing on a shoe-string budget what studios can't accomplish with truckloads of cash-money.",

This is a film that develops plausibly from a sort of claustrophobic horror-drama into a surprisingly more emotional thriller with grounded characters.\n\nThe film is made with parts that are not completely unfamiliar with movie veterans. What makes the film compelling and stand out is its suspenseful direction and the characters. As Roger Ebert once said, \"A movie is not about what it's about. It's about how it's about it.\"\n\nYou begin the film thinking that Henry Louis (Emile Hirsh) is a psychopathic creep who is raising a girl named Chloe (Lexy Kolker) who may not even be his own daughter. Their house is ill-kept and boarded up, suggesting perhaps that the house is abandoned or that Henry is a fugitive. If this story had been told from any other perspective, it would have gained a sense of objectivity and omniscience, where there would be no ambiguity about Henry, but the story is framed mostly from young Chloe's perspective, who in her first few years witnesses her father's strange behavior, as well as an old man who runs an ice cream truck, who may know more about the real world than her father is letting on. This is the sort of ambivalence and inner conflict children feel all the time, and so we identify with Chloe, with her built-up curiosities and frustrations--and their consequences. In a way, part of the film is about growing up and how the follies of society magnify the worst in us. \n\nThere are several other subplots and subtexts, some of which I won't mention to avoid spoilers. There are the scenes throughout the movie where Chloe sees visions of a woman in her closet, and visions where she finds herself at a neighbor girl's sleepover party. It's clear that both her visions and how she interacts with them are, at least initially, out of her control and comprehension. Because Chloe lives in an aggressive world where others seem malevolent towards her on principle, poor Chloe does not really stand a chance in growing up well-adjusted. No attempt is made for a peaceful dialogue between Chloe and her enemies, and I think the film may have benefited from explaining why everyone is so uncompromisingly hostile. \n\n\"Freaks\" is dark, unpleasant, suspenseful, and poignant. It's good cinema, much more inspiring as a thriller, I think, than \"The Invitation\" or \"It Comes at Night.\" If you want to feel depressed and sad, this is likely for you.",

The cinematography includes lots of orange light and distorted backgrounds with close up shots that make for a unique viewing.

Basically they promote this thing like it's the next big thing in Science Fiction, when it's just a very old idea that's been done to death. As for the film itself, it takes forever to get going and even longer for you to realize just what the hell is going on. This crazed father is babbling on making no sense and keeping this little girl locked in this house. All she seems to care about is ice cream, more so than the life of her father or her personal safety, the whole thing was just so bizarre. As for the cast, there really wasn't any chemistry, Emile Hirsch was just awful, playing this paranoid babbling idiot. He's paired with Bruce Dern, who is far too old to really do much of anything, and then there's Chole (Lexy Kolker), the little girl stuck in the middle of all it. The bottom line, Freaks is an idea that has been done and done again, with a cast that so vastly different, that really doesn't click on any level. Worst of all it takes so long to get going and explain what's going on. By the time you finally get it, you've really stopped caring.

So it's a little Room-ish, but for much different reasons.  There are super powers, but there is also a through line that just because you're different you're a freak.  Hence the name of the movie, which at times overplays how harsh the majority is to minorities.  Newcomer Lexy Kolker portrays a seven year old with special powers.  She is a revelation.  Longtimer Bruce Dern as her grandfather and Emile Hirsch as her dad complete a trio that all have a wonderful chemistry.  Dern continues to take projects that are different.  He's marvelous in this.  It's the kind of movie that could catch on and become a cult classic.  Perhaps someday even a sequel.... or a prequel!  Final Score: 8.8/10",

Almost all of the scenes were over the top, the script was fine but at times it was laughably bad. Some parts were cliche but I'm surprised it wasn't overly cliche. It is very predictable at times, they have some really weird narrative choices that completely threw me off of the story and for some reason, they made no character likable even the child that would seem like she is likable she really isn't and the film drags because of that. They also set up a sequel and I hope they don't. The only good thing I can think this movie did somewhat well was Bruce Dern's acting.

It has to be somewhat annoying at first to really drill into you why this kid behaves this way so she doesn't just come across as a brat with superpowers. And even better is that it doesn't end with a sense that they could have done more. And even better, it's a stand alone film (so far) so it doesn't have the chance to lose momentum over the course of a series or a billion identical sequels.

I recommend you do the same if you decide to check this one out.

Henry is teaching Chloe how to blend in and appear \"normal.\" Henry makes Chloe scared of the outside world telling her that if she's ever to leave the people outside will kill her. Pretty mysterious right? The thing is when Chloe looks outside it appears the world is quite normal. With a craving for ice cream like no other one day Chloe runs outside the house and meets a somewhat creepy ice cream man named Mr. Snowcone (Bruce Dern). Mr. Snowcone drops some knowledge on Chloe and tells her that she's special and that there's much more to what's going in the world than what she really believes. I'm being incredibly vague here because there's a lot to benefit not know the whole story here. I want to avoid spoilers, so I will say this one had some great pacing, a very good plot where you really feel for the characters. The film also is a low budget indie film and it shows, but they make use of the sets quite well here. By the time the movie was done I actually wanted to see more and explore more of this world they show off here.

If this would happen in real life, I imagine it would feel just as chaotic and confusing. We have multiple important characters none of whom are perfectly good, but no one is wholly bad which, again, is true in real life most of the time. Although the subject of super powers is explored in hundreds of movies, for me this one did it best. The movie introduces the ultimate dilemma that makes you think about the greater good or the lesser evil in a very personal and painful way, this should be explored further, there is so much material to continue the story and develop characters, it feels like this is just a beginning. I would have loved to read this story in a book, with plenty of details, from a perspective of multiple characters. Excellent acting by the leads and I just have to mention the use of colour throughout the movie, so much work was put into that alone and the result is so satisfying.

We've seen this kind of thing before, but the way this movie tells its story was actually really interesting. It throws you into this world and slowly gives you information about what's really going on, like an unfolding mystery. This made for a very engaging and entertaining film. I actually see real franchise potential, there are all sorts of stories that could be told that take place in this world that I would love to see explored, like a low-budget MCU.

And that's why it works. The daughter, mother, father and grandpa family tree that forms the film is a messy tangle of branches and unwieldy roots, which slowly align as the plot unfolds.\n\nLexy Kolker as single digit aged Chloe, brings a charming naiveté of someone new to life, who might have access to a mysterious super power. The movie rests on her tiny shoulders, and she pulls it off. Whether dealing with her sketchy dad (Emile Hersh) who may or may not be crazy, or her ghostly mom (Amanda Crew) who may or may not be real, or her sketchy grandpa (Bruce Dern) who may or may not be the neighbourhood ice cream man, Chloe is the central magnet and is damn easy to root for.\n\nAdding another late career feather in his well worn acting hat, Dern is devilicious in his rambunctious retiree role, offering equal doses of creepiness and blood line dedication. Chloe's confusing and changing allegiances to her dad and grandpa is a clever device that spices up this top notch thriller.\n\nMy biggest problem with Emile Hirsch is that he looks and acts like Jack Black. It's distracting. But that's a personal qualm, and one that shouldn't detract from the performance, which is manic good.\n\nYes the story gets a little wacky, after all we are talking about an apocalyptic mutant scenario, so wacky is par for the course. There's enough heart, relatability, and thankfully a lack of superhero posturing (no silly costumes!) to make \"Freaks\"  a winner.\n\nYup.\n\n- hipCRANK",

At least give Lexy some love and put her photo on the movie review site. This young actress was the focus of the film in a not terribly original role of an omnipotent child realizing her awesome kick-ass potential but the role was well executed. What made her sympathetic was her longing for her (believed dead) mother and how desperate she was to find a substitute. I did particularly enjoy the part about Dallas being destroyed. That was a nice touch for a Houston boy. ",

It seems like it is one of those small movies that it really good and deserved a bigger release. If you like sci-fi you will probably like this movie. ",

It is refreshing to see a Suspense/thriller movie with a truly original approach, that does not follow tired cliches and tropes that seem to be what movies have become today. Rod Serling would have sat in the theater and wondered what was coming next as I did, the script and film work held me spellbound in my seat. Sets were used at a minimum and I loved the house, there was always something new to spot (such as the writing or drawings on the walls) I would have spent the entire day walking that set just to explore the background. \nThis is a must see movie when it is officially released, it will not disappoint",
