His use of facial expressions says so much about his character here, along with the rest of his take on the actual attorney Rob Billott. Robbins and especially Hathaway give strong support as Billott's boss and wife, respectively.\nAnd you can try to bury him under a farmer's cap, sasquatch eyebrows, and some sort of rural accent, but I know Bill Camp. He's great again here, as usual. \nThis is fairly rote stuff, direction and story-wise, with the obligatory final case results on the screen before the closing credits, but Todd Haynes still did a solid job with tone, the use of dark, muted lighting to give a feel of ominous, impending gloom, and the parts of the story he chose to use both in Billott's working of the case and its effects on his family.\nVery good movie, Haynes. 3.6 stars",

The film dramatizes Robert Bilott's (Mark Ruffalo) 20-year legal battle against the chemical company, DuPont. Unlike Travolta's character in A Civil Action — a film with a similar, more isolated plot — Robert is far from a Class Action/Tort litigator. In fact, when we meet Robert, he defends chemical companies at a fancy Cincinnati-based law firm. It's not until a cantankerous farmer (Bill Camp) shows up at his office (all the way from W.Va) that Robert tugs on a thread that will reshape his family life, career, and morals. At first, the movie does seem like a 2019 version of A Civil Action — poor, rural town whose water is poisoned — but quickly expands far beyond anything I had imagined. Moreover, the story arc is, well, not an arc at all, but a roller-coaster peak and trough excursion of wins and losses. Tim Robbins plays the gray-haired managing partner and delivers head-nodding pro-lawyer, pro-human speech. The ending is satisfying, but maybe not satisfying enough for what the company has done to each and every one of us.",

In fact, I found the film to be the opposite. I think Tim Robbins's character said it best when he said WTTE we will defend corporations when they deserve defense, but when they are wrong, we will nail them. I could not agree more. To the degree that this movie is accurate to actual events, that statement applies.\n\nTo be sure, this is not the type of movie that people who do not like a methodical, thinking story, instead preferring mindless popcorn action. The movie slowly builds the case against DuPont. The pacing is excellent for a story that spans two decades. I also loved how moody and atmospheric the setting is: I don't think the sun ever shines on West Virginia! But this fits well with the mood of the story.\n\nI highly recommend this movie, even if you are not naturally aligned to Hollywood's attacks on business or can't stomach the real world politics of guys like Ruffalo.

So many films over the years have fallen into the trap of sacrificing one element for another and ultimately coming up weaker for it. The draw of Dark Waters lies in its realistic structure: a long, excruciating, slow-burning struggle that leaves the audience at best mildly infuriated and at worst steaming. This procedural, expansive take might also be its greatest weakness as well as strength, due to some repetition and dullness over the 2+ hours.\n\nRuffalo and Hathaway are absolutely Hollywood A-listers, although Hathaway doesn't actually do much here. She is undoubtedly only second behind Ruffalo in having the most lines in the film, but the action is driven forwards by Ruffalo with Hathaway firmly in a supporting role with a few scenes to step up and take control. Her style might be over-the-top for some, and there are occasions where she becomes larger than life in typical, scene-stealing Hathaway fashion. Ruffalo himself does quite well in a fairly understated role with fleeting moments to shine. I thought that Bill Camp was brilliant in a smaller role as a farmer who loses everything as a result of a frankly evil chemical corporation.\n\nOn the subject of the corporation and the film's themes, I thought that the film managed to layer the conflict really well without oversimplifying in too many places. We also receive a rare humanization of lawyers who typically represent corporations. Rob's character begins the film as one, but experiences an awakening upon the realisation that such despicable actions have been committed by DuPont. The varying degrees of support that Rob receives from the legal camp also humanizes his fellow lawyers, striking against the Man vs. World trope so often seen while also having the \"right\" side remain the underdog. We have a straightforward social issue film without too many bells and whistles and a purpose easy to get behind.",

And while I am a big Anne Hathaway fan (and to a lesser extent, a Mark Ruffalo fan as well), both seem to mail in their performances. Hathaway as the \"this case is costing you your family because your never home\" wife, who ever once in a while has a breakdown. Whereas Ruffalo seems dazed throughout with the exception of a few times he actually gets emotional and passionate. Interesting subject, but averagely executed.",

With his eighth feature, director Todd Haynes has crafted an authentic account of the legal case against the DuPont corporation. It's the filmmaker's first attempt to dramatize Robert Bilott's case against the chemical corporation, but he pulls it off seamlessly. Using captivating cinematography, Haynes draws viewers in the life of an obsessive lawyer. From intimate close-ups to tense tracking shots, the cinematography keeps viewers immersed in the film's setting. It gives the film a dark and gloomy atmosphere that is reminiscent of legal thrillers from the 1990's. It is hard to not praise the powerful performances from the cast. Mark Ruffalo delivers one of the best performances of his career as Robert Bilott. With riveting expressions, he conveys the dedication, tenacity and righteous fury of the real-life lawyer. The supporting cast, which includes the esteemed Tim Robbins, is also worthy of recognition. Although \"Dark Waters\" is undeniably unforgettable, ultimately it is not a flawless film. At over two hours, it is slightly long and suffers from a lengthy running-time. Moreover, the film builds to the formulaic conclusion that is typical of films in the genre. Nevertheless, fans of legal thrillers will definitely enjoy \"Dark Waters\" and so will movie-goers seeking engrossing entertainment. At a time when modern audiences have never heard of the DuPont legal case, it's a stirring reminder that the stories of heroic whistleblowers are worth retelling on the big-screen.",

I think if they cast someone a little more emotional than Ruffalo, say Paul Giamattti, this movie could have been Oscar worthy. Anne Hathaway actually out performed Ruffalo as a supporting character, so Ruffalo may not have been the best choice.

But, geez, it was quite a dull ride.\n\nSure, a film such as Erin Brockovich is sensationalist – a bit cheesy, but it was a hoot to watch, and I am still referring to it 20 years on. I bet, five years from now, when faced with someone else's Teflon pan and the evil legacy of the coating – the subject of Dark waters – I will be squinting and frowning, trying to recall even the name of this film.\n\nTake The big short as another example. It also told a real-life tale, also honoured the victims and pointed out the guilty, and dealt with very serious subject matter to boot. It was a thrill ride from beginning to end, with larger-than-life characters and quirky interviews. It also broke down very complex information into totally understandable bits of information.\n\nThe miniseries Chernobyl was slow-paced and rather heavy, but riveting to watch, even though you knew what the outcome would be. You still hoped it wouldn't be so. In other words, you can go various routes when telling a real-life tale: you can be funny, you can be serious, you can be quirky, if you are entertaining.\n\nPerhaps this is not director Todd Haynes's forte, the real-life tale told in a straightforward manner. The man has quite the Rotten Tomatoes CV. In between Far from heaven (2003) and Certain women (2016), there are quite a few fresh tomatoes thrown in. Let's face it, the fact that he did not win an Oscar for Carol was an affront to mankind. I cannot quite explain what went wrong with Dark waters. I mean, even Mark Ruffalo was rather bland in this. And when was Anne Hathaway relegated to playing a teeny-weeny part as the boring wife? The only interesting character was Bill Camp as Wilbur Tennant, and he doesn't feature a hell of a lot.\n\nIt is a fascinating story of corporate greed and environmental disaster. I did not feel the outrage.",

            "content": "Dark Waters is a meticulously crafted film that is both very important and very entertaining. It digs deep into the disgraceful actions of large corporations with a very sharp scalpel. Mark Ruffalo is superb as Robert Billot, a corporate lawyer who ends up dedicating his life to fighting for the 'little person'. In this case it's against the horrendous practices of the Dupont company, one of the largest chemical companies in the world. After a farmer discovers his herd of cows are all dying after drinking from the local river, it leads to finding that many people in his small West Virginia town have developed and died from cancer through a contaminated water supply. Through lengthy and painstaking research Billot uncovers the dark secrets of Dupont. A chemical created (PFOA) for the making of Teflon is actually a direct cause of cancer and it was dumped directly into the environment. The film is a true legal thriller as we see Billot go head to head in court to win damages for his clients in a large class action suit. Director Todd Haynes has made many different films in his storied career and he tackles this genre with great skill. He is aided by a terrific cast that also includes Tim Robbins, Bill Camp and Anne Hathaway. The film has a very grey palate that suits the seriousness of the subject. But this film is no chore, its vital importance is thankfully matched by a snappy pace and a vital heart.",

You probably won't like learning that we're all walking around full of the kinds of chemicals that Dupont willfully poisoned people with, but it's educational nonetheless.

Without giving away any specific details, I'm going to say this, I'm extremely disappointed in our governments lack of care when it comes to manufacturers polluting our streams, rivers and lands.  As long as DuPont can make a donation to a senator or congressman, EPA officials, whoever they need to turn their heads, and those people do turn their heads and listens with deaf ears, we are in disparate trouble.  I was shocked to discover the decades and years of proof that our our government elected officials chose to ignore.  All at the cost of losing lives, loved ones losing children, parents, siblings, friends, anyone who loved the person who died.  Not to mention, the deformed newborns.  This Attorney's fight is not over.  With every new year, new DuPont Attorneys and new CEO's try to change the rules, only caring about their shareholders growth and the board of directors thinking only with billions of dollars in their brains.  It makes me sick.  Shamed on anyone who partook in this fiasco!!  Why are laws so flexible to those with huge amounts of money?  These corporations should be held responsible for not only their knowledge of hiding such lethal chemical knowledge, as they willfully continue to manufacture a lethal product and plaintiffs continue to sue for damages, try should also be fined where it counts and where it hurts the very most.  They should be forced to shut down all operations of their daily  billion dollar money maker ( I \"think\" they said a DAY), the Teflon production line.  Shut it down for however long it takes for them to create an eco friendly/Green version of a non stick surface.  Not allowing the production to return until they've properly destroyed all HAZMAT chemicals, properly cleaned the city, lakes, streams, water systems, and their factory machines and floors.  When a manufacturer Is allowed and subsequently allowed to murder people, murder pets and wildlife, murder farm animals being raised to put on our plates at home, make deform babies within a pregnant woman's womb, THERE IS SOMETHING SERIOUSLY WRONG WITH OUR SYSTEM ANDOUR GOVERNMENT.  After watching this movie, if you are not shocked,  heartbroken and lastly. angry at DuPont, you could be a narcissist, much like our government robots who sell themselves to the highest bidder without a care who they are allowing to be harmed.  This is a must see movie for anyone still passionate about justice and liberty for all.  2000's Corporate America today and in the future.  The longer they''re still able to conduct business,  the more ruthless they become.  No one can touch them.  Sound familiar?!?!  Exactly! Get the ‘hoes for dollas' out of office.

When approached by a farmer from his home town in West Virginia for help he initially dismisses him but then curiosity gets the better of him when he sees it as an ideal excuse to visit his childhood home. While there he is shown evidence that DuPont, one of America's largest chemical companies has knowingly been releasing chemicals into the local water supply that has resulted in the death of cattle and numerous health issues for local residents who have been drinking the water. From here, Rob turns everything he knows against those he used to work for, sacrificing his career, his family and his own health to take on one of America's largest corporations to bring justice for the people their negligence failed.  \nDark Waters is an important and powerful film that I think everyone should see.  The consequences of the actions carried out by one corporation in America many years ago have had far reaching and world wide effects that I am sure most of the population will be completely unaware of.  Mark Ruffalo does a superb job as the lawyer at the centre of the big fight and you will leave the film with nothing but admiration for the man he portrays.  An environmental thriller that will leave you paranoid about what you're drinking and the products you are using in your own home.",

Dark Waters is a fair legal thriller film focusing on the story about Robert Bilott (Mark Ruffalo) and his discovery about DuPont and their chemical factories that is affecting the water supply and appliances that is toxic to a persons health. The plot was informative about the events that took place. It is kind of scary cause the appliances and stuff that everyone uses is involved. And can put a person at risk for cancer or some health related issue. Performances by Mark Ruffalo and Anne Hathaway was good. I did find the film to have a slow moving direction and dragged in the middle of the movie. Overall, Dark Waters is an okay film with a thought provoking plot and performances.

            "content": "One of the most shocking films you'll ever watch.\n\nTodd Haynes' legal thriller Dark Waters (2019) is a masterpiece of impeccable direction telling a fascinating true story in harrowing detail with a riveting lead performance from Mark Ruffalo. I'm so glad I gave Dark Waters a chance. I thought it would be a generic legal drama, but it's impeccably directed and well researched with harrowing information. Dark Waters is for fans of Zodiac, Spotlight, Erin Brockovich, All the President's Men, Contagion, and Chernobyl. I am confident it will enrage, shock, and sicken you. Corporations are evil and get away with murder; never forget that.\n\nTodd Haynes is a director to watch after Carol and Dark Waters, he has established himself as a stylish auteur of classy resolve and striking vision. I can say that Darks Waters blew me away and I expected very little from this legal thriller. But Haynes provides endless information, compelling evidence, steadfast direction, and uncompromising vision for this brave story. Dark Waters will hopefully let audiences become aware of Dupont's criminal negligence in poisoning the world with their C-8 chemicals in toxic dumps to kitchen pans. I really hope that people will acknowledge the heroic and tireless work of lawyer Robert Bilott. \n\nMatthew Michael Carnahan and Mario Correa's script is mature and full of interesting takes on legal jargon used to defend corporate interests. They are very sympathetic to the affected communities with their humanistic writing. Affonso Gonçalves' editing is very smooth and keeps you in the moment as he cleverly transitions by year with neat little scenes. I appreciate how he just lets scenes breathe for a moment before cutting to the next relative sequence of events. I really liked Marcelo Zarvos' score. It's beautifully haunting and fits the dark subject matter aptly.\n\nMark Ruffalo has really come into his own with these niche political, crime, and legal thrillers like Zodiac, Spotlight, and Dark Waters. He's very subtle and nuanced here as Robert Bilott. The horror of what Bilott is finding out dawns on his face in revealing close-ups. Edward Lachman's sleek cinematography really makes Ruffalo look isolated and alone in his fight against Dupont. Anne Hathaway returns to serious dramatic acting for the first time since Brokeback Mountain and she's really moving here in Dark Waters as Ruffalo's long suffering wife Sarah Bilott.\n\nTim Robbins is wonderful as the harsh and blunt law firm head and boss to Ruffalo named Tom Terp. He advocates for justice and good lawyering in an intriguing role for sure. Bill Camp is phenomenal with a thick accent and heavy empathy for the poor farmer Wilbur Tennant. He carries scenes with an unusually notably gravitas. Bill Pullman is likable as the passionate class action lawsuit lawyer Harry Dietzler. I should mention the excellent performance from Victor Garber as Dupont's law representative.\n\nIn short, Dark Waters is so engaging due to Haynes' magical direction alongside its numerous fascinating character performances. Lastly, I just want to say it was very sweet of Todd Haynes to include cute hidden cameos from the real people involved in this unreal story.",

It's not a typical Todd Haynes movie, and I'm still wondering why it seemed to have caught so few people's attention. It was a similar story to that of Erin Brockovich, but instead of a busty, ballsy woman, the protagonist is a schlubby lawyer who is just trying to do the right thing. I also wonder if people are so inured by the awfulness of the world, with every day bringing a new horror, that the true story of DuPont purposefully poisoning citizens in West Virginia just can't find room to get on people's radar. I wonder if we are so inured to the depravity of corporations in their search of profit, that this story doesn't resonate more widely. I'd definitely recommend catching it on streaming.",

His direction is much more restrained and it fits the story well. While the story is definitely important, the film does have flaws. There are some pacing issues. The film jumps through time a little too much, particularly towards the end. Also, they needed to give Hathaway more to do. She feels wasted. Overall, I really enjoyed this film.

A lot of these modern true stories end up feeling so similar, and it gets kind of boring watching one, but I feel like Dark Waters adds its own spin on things.

One usually gets the standard film where the drama in the court room takes center stage and as the mountain of evidence is revealed the film usually shows it off in dramatic fashion. That is NOT the case with Dark Waters; rest assured that it's a good thing it doesn't do any of that.\nStarring Mark Ruffalo and Anne Hathaway, Dark Waters tells the true story of how one corporate defense attorney sought to bring the truth to light to this country of how the DuPont corporation had been knowingly poisoning the water system in West Virginia for decades while lying to the EPA about its chemicals. Ruffalo's character, Robert Bilott, risks his entire career, his family and even his very life to try bring the truth out to everyone. Dark Waters is carried by fine acting performances by Ruffalo and Anne Hathaway, who plays as Bilott's wife, Sarah Bilott. Together they successfully exemplify the drama of the family dynamics as the court case begins to affect everyone involved. What makes this film a very good film is that it focuses on Bilott's journey to uncover the truth while also making this a very human story, not just about the Bilott's but of the affected community as well. It could have focused only on the evidence how it was uncovered but by choosing to go the other route instead, this movie turns into a more intriguing eco-thriller well worth the time to go see in theatres. Incredibly, it's a true story that is actually still ongoing, although the film does have a good ending.",

The true story of a chemical company essentially poisoning an entire town, and then engineering the cover up is a project that deserves attention. Unfortunately, for it's audiences it's a very hard watch with little reward for the task.\n\nMark Ruffalo plays environmental attorney, Robert Bilott, someone who works for a firm that is used to defending chemical companies instead of prosecuting them. His life is turned upside down when a farmer from a West Virginia town comes to him for help regarding a chemical company he suspects is behind the bizarre death of the animals on his farm. As Bilott digs further he uncovers evidence that stretches back decades and provokes the wrath of corporation worth billions that will do what it has to in order to protect their operation.\n\nThe problem here is director, Todd Haynes, sticks us into a gloomy box of a world for over 2 hours. There is no humor. There are no points to feel anything but pain along the course of the film. We want to root for Bilott but we're pushed into his misery as he seeks out justice. The only excitement we're getting is through the numerous hearings regarding the case and shuffling of attorney files.\n\nRuffalo is good and is getting some deserved award buzz, but the best moments belong to Anne Hathaway as his struggling wife, and Tim Robbins as his tough but sympathetic boss. In fact, without those two, the film can't pick up a pace faster than a painful crawl.\n\n\"Dark Waters\" is not a bad film. And there are some strong dramatic moments, but it's such a heavy lift of a watch, I suspect many of us will take the quietly satisfying feeling we get at the end of the story and never look back.",

He gets approached in his office by a small-town farmer from West Virginia (Bill Camp) who is convinced that a big-time chemical company is poisoning the water near his property.  If Bilott decides to take this case on, how many shady practices will be uncovered?  Now it really was the positive word of mouth that got me into the theater.  Dark Waters has been getting mostly lofty reviews, and with an actor with street cred like Mark Ruffalo, I figured that I didn't have anything to lose.  I think that this is a really solid film, and it is a story that needs to be told.  Now I did not really know about this real-life story, and I imagine there are going to be a lot of people out there who are watching this with a similar point of view.  In that regard, this is both an educational and enlightening film.  The narrative structure is smartly laid out, and it makes it so that you get to experience the mystery unravel. What was actually going on behind the curtain is really messed up and it affected so many people, it's staggering.  I know lawyers typically get a bad reputation, so it is refreshing to see one that is determined to make sacrifices to do the morally right thing.  It really is Mark Ruffalo's movie and he sells it, playing this nebbish man forced into a situation where he has to be courageous.  It's a modern-day David and Goliath, and you can't have a good underdog story without having a villain.  That is played here by Victor Garber who goes against type and plays somebody despicable.  Even though you don't really see him committing atrocities on screen, you still understand the gravity of the decisions he is making, always interested in turning a profit even when there is blood on his hands.  I do have a few complaints about this, and while they are minor, I do feel like they are valid.  I think the script is solid, but I do feel like there could have been some cuts made in the third act to tighten things up; the flow works much better at the front end, and I don't think this needs to lose a lot, only ten minutes or so.  Also, Anne Hathaway is fine in this as the wife, but I did find her to be a bit one-dimensional.  She does have one good scene that I loved, but I feel like if they weren't going to do more with her, they should have given the part to somebody less recognizable.  I don't think that enjoy is the right word given the depressing subject matter, but I did appreciate Dark Waters and it's something that I can recommend to almost everybody.",

I had cancer when I was 25 and I'm really starting to rethink what the actual cause was as there was no family history. With that notwithstanding, the acting is on point. I teared up multiple times and not because of riveting monologues, courtroom heroics or emotional pandering but because we've all been f-ed over by the corporations who have made trillions and trillions of dollars poisoning us with one lawyer going through hell for the truth. This movie may be a bit of a slow burn but there's an entire nation held to the flame by corporate greed and villainy. I'm not even super liberal or a tree hugging environmentalist but maybe I need to rethink that thanks to great directing by Todd Haynes, amazing acting by Mark Ruffalo and Oscar worthy supporting acting by Anne Hathaway.  I also enjoyed Tim Robbins quite a bit towering above everyone else. My recommendation is to see this and tell anyone who's tried reading the ingredients  in products we use everyday to the point of dismal futility and wondered who's protecting us, the trusting consumer to see it. And it goes without saying that those ingredient lists only list what they are required to list, meanwhile countless departments and divisions of Fortune 500 companies find ways around all that pesky red tape.",

            "content": "December 6, 2019 (wide)\n\nDespite \"Dark Waters\" being based on an ongoing true story, it's so blatant with its point of view that it has us asking the question, is this for real? The movie goes to such lengths to push our emotional buttons and make sure we understand its plot that we suspect the filmmakers didn't think much of our intelligence and therefore felt the need to coddle us into thinking and feeling a certain way. They're also either too in love with their own message or don't have enough faith in their ability to convey it subtly. Whatever the case, the film tries too hard and it loses us.\n\nAll this comes as a surprise given the talent behind and in front of the camera. Director Todd Haynes helms the picture, which is arguably his most safe and mainstream to date after such colorful and offbeat works as \"Velvet Goldmine,\" \"Far From Heaven\" and \"Carol.\" Because \"Dark Waters\" ends up being so mediocre by comparison, Haynes should stick with the colorful and offbeat; they suit him better.\n\nMark Ruffalo is the film's producer and star. He plays Robert Bilott, an environmental lawyer at Taft Stettinius & Hollister, a high-profile firm out of Cincinnati that serves mostly large corporate clients. Bilott has just made partner and his wife Sarah (Anne Hathaway), also an attorney, has just taken leave from her job to raise their newborn son. \n\nThe Bilotts are happy and comfortable at the moment, but that soon changes when dairy farmer Wilbur Tennant (Bill Camp), along with his brother Jim (Jim Azelvandre), storm into Rob's tidy office, dressed down in dirt-stained jeans, plaid shirts and rustic baseball caps. Wilbur has never met Rob but he insists he watch his VHS tapes and review other evidence that show how the DuPont chemical company's waste, which feeds into the creek near the Tennant farm, is killing Wilbur's cows, which have started twitching, hopping about uncontrollably, and charging Wilbur and his farmhands instead of allowing themselves to be milked. In addition to the VHS tapes, Wilbur has collected the cows' abnormally large organs and hidden them in his freezer.\n\nEven though Rob tells Wilbur he's not a plaintiff or private citizen lawyer, he decides to drive the three hours from Cincinnati to Parkersburg, West Virginia and visit the Tennant farm. After all, it was Rob's grandmother, who lives just outside Parkersburg, who gave Wilbur Rob's contact information. So, in way, Rob feels he has somewhat of a personal obligation to check thing outs. \n\nWhat Rob sees and learns on the Tennant farm doesn't sit well with him and he suddenly finds himself asking his boss, Tom Terp (Tim Robbins), for permission to conduct a standard, by-the-book investigation into DuPont, just to see if anything is amiss and confirm if the company is, as Wilbur claims, \"trying to cover something up.\" Rob starts digging further and, by and by, one document, lab report and obscure acronym quickly leads to another until it becomes clear DuPont does, in fact, have something to hide, namely that their products, with the most popular being the ubiquitous, non-stick coating substance Teflon, are pollutants and their improper disposal in the Parkersburg water supply are creating a public health crisis. It would take years, but scientists would eventually find a \"probable link\" between DuPont's chemicals and health disorders such as kidney cancer, testicular cancer, thyroid disease, high cholesterol, pre-eclampsia and ulcerative colitis.\n\nOf course, DuPont executives like Phil Donnelly (Victor Garber) are quick to dismiss the accusations, and when the soft-spoken Rob presses him at a black tie event, in order to paint Donnelly as evil a man as possible, the script has him drop an F-bomb for all to hear. \n\nNevertheless, Rob obtains a court order for DuPont to hand over all its documents related to perfluorooctanoic acid, cryptically referred to as \"PFOA,\" and before he knows it, a truckload of boxes containing more than 110,000 documents shows up at Taft's front door. For the next few months, Rob all but lives in a storage room, sifting each and every file, labeling them according to year with Post-it Notes, and getting the full scope on DuPont. He eventually pieces together a chilling narrative and explains to a concerned Sarah, who's now pregnant with their second child, the company has been poisoning the people (and animals) of Parkersburg by contaminating the town's water supply with unsafe levels of PFOA. He finds the company's shady practices go as far back as 1951 and finally, in 1999, about a year after Wilbur reached out to Rob, Rob files a federal suit against DuPont, which commences an ongoing fight to bring justice to anyone harmed by the company.\n\nAs the film chronicles its two decades, we get the usual assortment of questions, accusations, interviews, courtroom battles, public health screenings, etc. often associated with Hollywood legal dramas. It's clear to us early on that Rob is a good, humble man, willing to put in long hours, sacrifice time with his family, take pay cuts, and suffer both mentally and physically for his work (just as the film depicts, the real Rob endured stroke-like symptoms related to unusual brain activity, which were likely precipitated by stress brought on by the case).\n\nBut rather than simply show Rob behaving as a hero, the screenplay by Matthew Michael Carnahan and Mario Correa, based on Nathaniel Rich's New York Times Magazine article, \"The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare,\" also makes it a point to tell us, and not just once, but several times. There are at least three different scenes during which various characters speak explicitly about the good Rob is doing and that fighting a malfeasant corporation as large is DuPont is \"what justice is all about.\" It's as if Carnahan and Correa didn't trust us to pick up on Rob's \"goodism\" on our own, that it had to be underlined. This cajoling of the audience continues up through the end, when Johnny Cash's version of \"I Won't Back Down\" plays over the closing credits.\n\nIt's a shame the movie feels the need to overemphasize its main character's mission and values because this approach ends up being frustrating. The story \"Dark Waters\" wants to expose is a relevant and important one, but the filmmakers don't make us think very hard, consider the facts impartially, or form opinions of our own. The script does this for us, spelling things out in layman's terms and in too straightforward a manner. And rather than assume we'd be interested in the law and how it applies to a complex case like the people of Parkersburg vs DuPont, Haynes instead opts for easy emotional payoffs and flagrant grandstanding, like when Rob grills DuPont's CEO during a deposition and the other DuPont lawyers at the table whisper, \"We're done here\" and \"We're going on seven hours,\" as if we needed to be reminded of Rob's relentless dedication to his job and the common people he's representing. And just to make him seem more heroic and vulnerable, the film adds routine thriller elements to the mix, like Rob feeling paranoid because he thinks someone is following him or hesitating to start his car because it might explode.\n\nIf some aspects of the film feel manipulative, others feel over-the-top, including Bill Pullman as trial lawyer Harry Deitzler, who works with Rob on the case. Whether or not Pullman's accent and eccentricities invoke the real Deitzler is beside the point; his performance is too theatrical to be taken seriously and he hovers on being annoying. Plus, the movie is too willing to paint its other minor characters in simple black-white terms, with those from the DuPont legal camp only allowed to be evil and the families and blue-collar workers affected by DuPont's chemicals only allowed to be victims. For a story about such a long, complicated case, \"Dark Waters\" not very complicated\n\nFor the record, I'm not saying that what happens in \"Dark Waters\" isn't necessarily inaccurate or a misrepresentation of the truth, but accurate or not, it doesn't have to patronize us and the filmmakers would have been wise to let up on the melodrama a bit and allow the material to speak for itself. This is ultimately why I think it would have been better suited as a documentary that heard from both sides equally, presenting the story objectively and making it more well-rounded and interesting. Granted, we would likely walk away from such a non-fiction version with the same feelings \"Dark Waters\" forces upon us, but at least we would have developed those feelings on our own.",

Everything was dimly lit and unnaturally depressing- unless perhaps the projector for my auditorium had a bulb going out.  The music was ridiculous.  Entire scenes and montages were scored by vague atmospheric music with the occasional piano key strike.  You couldn't have scored the film better for the purpose of putting the audience to sleep if that had been your actual intent.  \n\nThe critics consensus claims that the film \"honors the victims.\"  Well, only in the sense that some of them and their family members get small and unflattering roles in the film, I suppose.  But the main victim character is portrayed as such a complete jerk that it's actually kind of hard to root for him even as his business is being destroyed and his health compromised for the sake of greed.  \n\nThis movie is a tedious grind, even setting aside the fact that you've basically seen practically the same story, told massively better, 20 years ago.  Perhaps even more tedious of a grind considering it's shot very much like a horror movie that suggests you're supposed to feel some level of suspense for which you never receive a payoff.  I suspect that at least half of the critics who claim to have enjoyed it are virtue-signalling rather than evaluating it as an actual film.  It's one of the worst-directed, worst-edited, and worst-scored movies I've ever seen, bar none.  \n\nThis may not be my least-favorite movie of the year, but it's certainly in the top 5 (and I see practically all of them), and it's gotta be in the top one or two for technical flaws.",

Trying to expose them for chemical mishandling that has led to thousands of people getting all types of cancers, tumors, and birth deformities in the U.S. \n\nMark Ruffalo does a great job here cast as the main character, going through all the pitfalls (family, career, finances, all suffer) of fighting a powerful corporation in court.\nAnne Hathaway plays his wife (a former lawyer), who's tasked with keeping her sanity as her husband becomes obsessed with taking down DuPont at the detriment of their marriage. Tim Robbins plays his boss from the firm trying to figure out whether to green light a sue of DuPont.\n\nThis movie has a lot of chemical talk, but thankfully it is all explained perfectly for audiences (like myself) who know basic chemistry or none at all. As the story goes on, the facts about what DuPont did to people and animals knowingly is staggering. In fact, this case is still going on today. There are families still currently getting money from DuPont as \"restitution\" for poisoning them. \n\nIt really is an eye opening experience. Just Google DuPont and Teflon and you'll see what a mean. Thousands of people have suffered, especially in Northern East Coast. Mark Ruffalo gives a great performance along with nice cameo by Bill Pullman.\n\nFINAL REVIEW: 7.5 out of 10.",

Though the film takes a little while to get going, the creeping build-up explodes into an absolutely engrossing investigative procedural drama with pressingly urgent stakes reminiscent of 2015's 'Spotlight.'\n'Dark Waters' is a heavy piece, but there are just enough good deeds scattered throughout the film to save you wanting to off yourself after the onslaught of upsetting biographic catharses. Because as much as its rattling, chilling implications may darken your worldview, it's really a story about people doing the right thing against all odds and circumstances.

This movie really shocked me in a lot of ways and it definitely felt like the people behind it cared about the subject matter. Mark Ruffalo does a great job playing a relatively ordinary guy who truly has a heroic level of determination. I was rooting for his character the whole way through and thought Ruffalo made him feel real and likable. The movie is a bit slow here and there and I did find myself zoning out now and then, but I always felt the importance of the movie's subject. Regardless of some minor pacing issues, I still felt pretty riveted by the time the movie ended. Overall, this movie is an unsettling piece of real-life horror that feels very necessary and urgent.",

Whereas in other, lesser films you'd be informed. Here, you're upended. Instead of being intrigued, here, you're spellbound. Horrified instead of alarmed. And as far as widened perspectives are concerned? How about trying a major paradigm shift on for size in the form of this harrowing cinematic treatise on unchecked power, the pursuit for truth, and the tragic, infrastructural downward spiral taking place in so many parts of the American Rust Belt.

Though you have seen this scene in many movies it still catches and you wish the rest of the movie was as suspenseful.\n\n\"Dark Waters\" is about a lawyer who defended big companies and now is heading a class law suit against one of the biggest--Dupont! Mark Ruffalo plays Robert Bilott who has been just made partner of a well known admired law firm. He is not the sharp, $1,000 suit-wearing guy you mostly see in movies but when a farmer from West Virginia, a friend of his grandmother, comes in with a load of video tapes and eventually shows him where he has buried a hundred of his cows, along with the organs of many, Bilott feels he has no choice and takes the case against the thoughts of other partners.\n\nThe case takes almost 20 years to be decided and we follow along how Dupont not manipulated the government but also the people. You may not have heard of PFOA but you are familiar with Teflon which is not only used in cookware and how it  does kill people and disfigures babies.\n\nThis is very much a procedural movie without much dramatics but it handles 20 decades in a little over 2 hours smoothly and let's us get to know many of the characters who are real people as this film is based on a story originally written in the New York Times.\n\nIn the end credits you get to see some of the people but in the movie, along with Mark Ruffalo, the actors such as Anne Hathaway, Tim Robbins, Bill Pulman, Victor Garber and Bill Camp with others, do a solid job of making their characters believable.\n\nAs with many films this season \"Dark Waters\" runs over 2 hours and this one could have been a little tighter but director Todd Haynes had to cover 18-19 years and does it smartly.",

Ruffalo was solid, as I have come to expect in these types of roles from him, but Bill Camp definitely stood out in this superb cast.

Sure, there were times she was upset and impatient, but she stood by him to the end, and that was refreshing in this kind of story, when the writers so often drive the main character to the point he's a lone wolf, akin to that line out of the musical Evita: \"It's hard to keep momentum when it is you you are following.\" It still boggles my mind he sifted through ALL that discovery.

Then, suddenly, a scene gripped my interest.  I put the phone away and started watching.  The movie slowly pulled me in (albeit very slowly) and I watched despite my utter distaste for the cinematographer's aesthetic.  The acting is solid and sometimes even superb although the pace is much like a turtle who doesn't even know it's in a race.  But it became riveting and in the end I'm glad I stayed.  The story needed to be told and it is a fitting time to tell it.  People are waking up.  Let's add to the momentum.  Maybe a similar story will be told about our cell phones one day.  Or vaccines.  Or the countless pharmaceuticals and over-the-counter pills and even the food we poison (Or sedate) ourselves with every day.  The moral of the story comes when he says something akin to \"there's no one looking out for you, you have to look out for yourself (and your fellow human beings)\".  The government doesn't care about you and won't protect you!  \"We protect us.\"  So don't expect the government to have your back.  Be skeptical of everything and protect yourself, your loved ones, and all of humanity if you can.   That's the bottom line and he learned this from an uneducated farmer.

            "content": "So, basically if I ever end up with a serious illness then I should take it up with DuPont? Sounds good.\n\nIf you weren't paranoid before, you will be now.\n\nSYNOPSIS:\nThis is the story based on a real person named \"Robert Bilott\" and inspired by an article titled \"The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare.\" Robert Bilott (Mark Ruffalo) is a lawyer who primarily defends chemical corporations until a farmer from his old town of West Virginia asks for help to prove that there are chemicals being dumped in the water that is the cause of large amount of cow deaths. Although unconvinced at first, through excessive research and digging, Robert begins to find horrifying evidence of something much worse than just a deadly chemical to cows, but humans and all creatures alike.\n\nDIRECTION:\nIf I'm being honest, I don't have much to say in this realm. The direction by Todd Haynes was as technically solid as any other good film. Yes, just \"good.\" The color palette was probably a little too dull even for the subject matter and really the film's strong points really lye in the writing and some strong performances. I feel almost any other director could've done the same job, if not better.\n\nWRITING:\nThe writing is definitely a step up from the directing. The writing isn't perfect as there are some scenes that almost seemed unnecessary and just had me thinking \"get to the story!\" Now, there is much to be said about how much time and effort it must've been to retrieve all of this information and translate it to script. Yes, it's been done before, ie: Spotlight, Zodiac, etc., but this is quite possibly one of the most important stories to be told today as this is something that is still affecting everyone... TODAY. It is based on the NYTIMES article \"The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare\" by Nathanial Rich, but obviously there was far more research than a 10ish page article.\n\nACTING:\nThe acting is definitely where the juice is at. This is where you take your regular beef sandwich and baptize it (In case you're not american enough to know what this means, it means you dump in in the beef juice). Mark Ruffalo gives a similarly excellent performance as he did in Spotlight. WOAH WOAH, I didn't say it was AS good, I said it was SIMILAR. Cool it, Mary. It's expected, but he really makes the film what it is. Anne Hathaway is great, as usual, but her role as the wife wasn't integral to the story. I understand showing he has a life outside of work with kids and a wife and showing the kid's grow older and older gives substance to the prolonged journey Robert is taking, but these were the scenes I felt could've been cut or replaced. Tim Robbins is in this and some other people and some other people. All did well, just kind've interchangeable.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nMr. John \"The Sexy and Over-qualified or something Critic Guy\" Yanulis, you rated this film a 3.5/5, yet after reading your overly long review it seems like a high rating. What can I say? I like it Ruff and I'm a sucker for investigative films on important and interesting topics. Also, I prefer rating my films on a 1-10 bases, but I'm limited. So really for me this film is like a 6.6/10.",

There is a valid question of how responsible we individuals are for what is in our environment, and what goes into our bodies.  Can ordinary citizens make decisions if we are kept ignorant?  Perhaps we want the products and the jobs of industry, and so willfully do not want to know how the sausage is made and its remnants are disposed of, in order that we may sleep at night. In other words, this movie is a thinking person's film. The direction and performances are fine, including the leads of Mark Ruffalo and Anne Hathaway.  Bill Camp playing the role of a cattle farmer who raises the alarm, merits a best supporting actor nomination this season.  DW doesn't seem like something people ought to rush to see, but as I have alluded, it is consciousness raising. The subject is real, including the stories of birth \"defects\". And one of those guys is in the movie!",

            "content": "Dark Waters is one of the most important stories told in the last century. Defense attorney Robert Billot is contacted by a West Virginian farmer whose cows are mysteriously dying. After digging through countless reports and documents, Billot is able to connect several human and animal illnesses, mutations and deaths to one of the world's largest corporations, DuPont the commodity chemical company. He then puts everything including his job, family and health at risk to expose one of the greatest cover-ups in American history. \nDirector Todd Haynes brilliantly tells this urgent story about a company lying to the government, poisoning the people of America and getting away with it. His attention to detail in capturing the passage of time is one of his greatest assets in reminding the audience of how long Billot has been fighting DuPont. Mark Ruffalo shines in the role of Rob Billot who does his best to warn characters in the film and audience members of the danger they are in to this day. Anne Hathaway plays a crucial supporting role and it's also nice to see Tim Robbins in a major film again, but the greatest performance of the film to me was Bill Camp as Wilbur Tennant, the farmer who reaches out to Billot in the first place. While not the largest part in the film, Camp's performance is Oscar worthy, as he is the emotional weight behind Billot's actions. Being an actor I was unfamiliar with, I genuinely thought he was the real Tennant. \nDark Waters is an informative piece on why we should fight for those who can't, why we should all be cautious of large corporations, why we should never give up hope. A definite recommendation for those who love legal dramas/thrillers.",

These details could've went over anyone's head but thankfully the film has an easygoing pace of dissecting and displaying information piece by piece.

Ever since I first saw the trailer I've been looking forward to this movie, not really realizing I'd leave the theater truly horrified thinking about the movie I had just watched. That's right, Dark Waters is a horror movie and if you're like me and have used any Teflon or water proofing products, we're all living it. \n\nAt this point I'm personally convinced Mark Ruffalo can do no wrong when it comes to making movies. His portrayal of real life attorney Rob Billett, as a quiet, almost fragile but steadfast in his beliefs and convictions was nothing short of phenomenal. \n\nNow, the rest of the movie filled with some great performers like Anne Hathaway, Tim Robbins, Victor Garber, and Bill Pullman, just to name a few. It's a real life David vs Goliath, as a chemical company corporate defense attorney first asked by a small town cattle farmer to go after Dupont, one of if not, the largest chemical company in the country. You see the horrifying reality of what the chemical they knowingly poisoned people with does to cattle and people. Meanwhile even with all the evidence stacked against Dupont, most people still believed that this company would never do anything wrong.\n\nThis movie was the scariest horror movie of all time, because it's real, and what Rob Billett is doing and has done doesn't make him the hero we deserve, he's the hero we need. In conclusion, see this movie, you'll leave the theater truly thinking about what you had just watched and you won't be disappointed in the movie or the acting.",

Mark Ruffalo gives a very real performance, as does Anne Hathaway. Neither of them are in the environment they are usually in, and yet, they make it feel as if their characters are. It also pulls information out of areas that were probably rather hard to dig into, as the final scene of the movie occurs in 2015, which feels all to recent for many a viewer, and the final text tells of events that are still happening today. A lot of the time, the MPAA looks at movies like this and tries to edit them down to make their PG-13 rating less true to title so kids can come see the movie. However, this is not the case with this movie. The movie has very little graphic content, but when it feels the need to be graphic, it allows itself to do so. Furthermore, this is the only PG-13 film I have witnessed recently that openly drops 2 F-bombs, as many films either edit them out or do something subtle, like how Venom put its Eminem song in the credits. This film has two F-bombs dropped in central moments of the film and given full focus. That is simply daring. However, my personal favorite thing about the film is the fact that it feels like a two hour movie. The movie doesn't fly by, it goes at a realistic pace, with no filler or unnecessary information given. It is a perfectly paced, perfectly acted and perfectly presented movie, and so far, my favorite film of this year.",

            "content": "Dark Waters is a compelling look at one man's fight against the corrupt practices of a multi-billion dollar company. \n\nBased on a true story, Dark Waters follows Rob Bilott (Mark Ruffalo), a corporate lawyer who gets a call from a family friend named Wilbur (Bill Camp) about a disturbance on his farm in West Virginia. Over 100 of Wilbur's cows have died and he suspects it has something to do with the creek running through his property. Wilbur's hunch becomes a frightening truth as Rob investigates decades' worth of wrong-doing by the DuPont chemical company.\n\nMark Ruffalo portrayal of Rob Bilott is excellent. He's plays the legal scenes with conviction, but he feels more like a vessel to receive information than a fully- formed character. We see plenty of Bilott's moral standards, but we rarely get a sense of what drives him to do the work he does or who he is emotionally. It makes it harder to fully connect with and invest in his character. A performance worth noting with much less screen time is Bill Pullman as lawyer Harry Dietzler. Pullman gives Dark Waters a boost of energy. He's not comedic relief, but he's certainly a breath of fresh air. \n\nTodd Haynes's direction is both impressive and overbearing. Haynes has a flair for stylistic flourishes in his other films and here the moody, muted lighting that clouds much of the film creates a feeling of anxiety that makes every step of Rob's journey and what he discovers uncomfortable in a way that's very effective. By the same token, the color scheme is dark and dreary throughout and the film ends up with a dull sheen and a tone that feels at times heavy-handed. \n\nAn aspect of the filmmaking I love is the use of tracking shots to show not only the lives that DuPont destroyed, but the communities too. Dark Waters is unflinching when it comes to depicting the consequences of DuPont's malpractice. It tells and more specifically, shows it, in a way that rightfully stirs up an audience reaction of anger and injustice.\n\nI recommend Dark Waters for ages 12 to 18 for some shocking images and brief language. I give it 3 out of 5 stars. If you're looking for a good or feel-good time at the cinema for the holidays, this isn't it, but Dark Waters is definitely an informative and important film. \n\nReviewed by Benjamin P., KIDS FIRST!

Be careful what you wish for?\n\nThat doesn't mean Dark Waters, the true story of a corporate attorney who sues his own client doesn't have merit.  I actually think the movie works really well, but I can't identify the filmmaker who brought us Velvet Goldmine, Carol or Far From Heaven here.  Written by Mario Correa and Matthew Michael Carnahan, the story spans decades, promisingly opening with an eerie Jaws-like sequence in which some 1970s teens swim naked in a polluted West Virginia lake.  You can feel Haynes in this scene more than anywhere else in the film, considering its haunting, dreamlike imagery.  \n\nFlashing forward to the late 1990s, the story properly starts when a farmer named Wilbur Tennant (a magnificent Bill Camp) barges in on Cincinnati Corporate Attorney Robert Bilott (Mark Ruffalo) to demand he return to his home town in West Virginia to investigate why his cattle have all started dying.  At first dismissing him as a crazy rube, Bilott decides to make the 120 mile drive to see for himself.  It doesn't hurt that his biggest client, DuPont, has a plant there which just may be poisoning the water supply.  Spoiler alert: They are!\n\nOne night at a fancy dinner, Bilott confronts a DuPont executive (a perfectly insidious Victor Garber) and gets such an obvious brush-off that he can't help but go down that rabbit hole.  Risking his standing at his law firm, presided over by Tom Terp (an unpredictable and passionate performance by Tim Robbins), to launch an investigation which takes over 20 years to complete.  It nearly kills him and deeply affects his marriage to his wife, a former attorney played by Anne Hathaway, and relationship with his son. Think Erin Brockovich without the humor and you'll get a good sense of the tone of this dreary, dark, nihilistic film.  \n\nIn 1995, Todd Haynes made the film, Safe, starring Julianne Moore as a woman with severe environmental allergies.  It was weird, experimental, and abstractly haunting. Dark Waters feels like the straightforward cousin to that film as it explores corporate greed and cover-ups and the lives left in the balance.  Yes, the great cinematographer Ed Lachman has a wonderful way of making you feel every bitter cold early sunset with his black, grey and dark blue color schemes.  Yes, the very talented and versatile production designer Hannah Beachler knows her way around working class homes.  It all comes together as a consistently bleak presentation, tailor made to make you feel the sheer hopelessness of taking on \"the man\".  \n\nRuffalo does incredible work as a defeated, hunched over workaholic who never gives up the fight.  We see nothing showy in his performance.  He carries the weight of the world on his shoulders when he realizes that DuPont has exposed almost the entire population on earth to harmful chemicals.  Hathaway also does excellent work as someone in the typical \"wife\" role who refuses to be identified as such.  She very slyly walks that fine line to give us something heartfelt and strong.  Bill Camp, however, walks away with the film with his almost indecipherable drawl and righteous anger at a system which ignores the safety and well being of the hard working citizens of the world.  Often specializing in low key characterizations, he switches gears and goes unforgettably big and loud.  In what amounts to a compelling yet quite ordinary telling of an important story, it's Camp who cuts through.  Todd Haynes may not have made a \"Todd Haynes Movie\" with Dark Waters, but at least he has given us Great Camp.",

We see nothing showy in his performance.  He carries the weight of the world on his shoulders when he realizes that DuPont has exposed almost the entire population on earth to harmful chemicals.  Hathaway also does excellent work as someone in the typical \"wife\" role who refuses to be identified as such.  She very slyly walks that fine line to give us something heartfelt and strong.  Bill Camp, however, walks away with the film with his almost indecipherable drawl and righteous anger at a system which ignores the safety and well being of the hard working citizens of the world.  Often specializing in low key characterizations, he switches gears and goes unforgettably big and loud.  In what amounts to a compelling yet quite ordinary telling of an important story, it's Camp who cuts through.  Todd Haynes may not have made a \"Todd Haynes Movie\" with Dark Waters, but at least he has given us Great Camp.",

            "content": "Todd's welcoming gift to this article alike film is important. Grammatically incorrect and even lofty in its speech. But suitably important and that is enough to peddle.\n\nDark Waters\n\nThe director Todd Haynes's desk is under tons and tons of paper. The challenging ones are shuffled in a two hour narration and sprinkled incoherently as opposed to a proper structure. It is very rare to see a film that is directed by someone and written by someone else and still lacks a definite pattern. Maybe that is the pattern or simply I don't get it- it's usually the latter one, trust me. But what Todd needs primarily is steadiness. Accepting the calmness, the patience that a job like such offers. Waiting for the formality to settle in and then stir the soup. He is just not ready to let it sit for a while. What we then get is always, everything is said to be in motion, no matter how inedible it grows. It is preposterous how the family drama, the conflict that could have easily rattled you, instead just disenchants you from buying into what they care about. It takes a lot of time for them to finally get into our head, almost in its final act, do we get to sit and mourn, meaningfully. To be honest, I am also going to blame the lack of chemistry between Anne Hathaway and Mark Ruffalo. Ruffalo who is basically a wild bear wearing a suit with manners and etiquette like some member of a White House joining for a big dinner, Hathaway unfortunately feels too sober to enjoy and let it affect her. She is simply not open enough. She had to hold the inner \"warning\" monologue of Ruffalo and instead she is found to be a delicious side dish that just doesn't fit into this cruel chemically conspired world.",

            "content": " Immersed for two and a half hours in the ugly Dark Waters world of institutional corruption and human greed, I left the theater and drove directly to Safeway to pick up a few last minute items for Thanksgiving. Studying canned fruit options, I started reliving teenage memories of mixing Dole fruit cocktail with newly invented Kraft Cool Whip, proudly declaring it a centerpiece holiday salad. Completely lost in daydreams of Thanksgivings past, I turned around and there staring at me was a display of nonstick frying pans! C8 alert! Corporate greed, government sellouts, Wall Street espionage, stacked court decisions, arson, Mad Cow disease, birth defects, cancer—all traced back to PFOA or C8, chemical talk for toxic fluorocarbons, aka Teflon! Doomsday in the canned fruit aisle! Dark Waters is an environmental drama based on the true David and Goliath story of Cincinnati corporate attorney Robert Bilott (Mark Ruffalo) who goes up against DuPont, a mega machine of greed. The story starts in 1989 with Bilott pulled from a partner meeting to be confronted by West Virginia cattle farmer, Wilbur Tennant (Bill Camp), who suspects DuPont of contaminating his Appalachian farm’s water supply, killing off his cattle. Tennnant, referred by Bilott’s grandmother, is outraged, agonizing over his bovine “like family” die-off, burying each cow in individual graves until the deaths are too numerous to keep up. In a flash of costuming brilliance, “Black Suits meet Bib Overalls,” the Blue Collar vs. Corporate America showdown is set for the rest of the film. Thus begins a lengthy eco-crusade—that is still playing out to this day. If there is a way, legal or not, for DuPont execs to avoid, defer, bury, squash, squelch, threaten and delay justice, they do it and with impunity. But once Bilott is made a believer—after wading through a dusty box of Tennant’s VHS evidence tapes and a frightening up close and personal mad cow encounter—he doggedly stalks and sues DuPont in perpetuity. Currently, Bilott is bringing a major class action lawsuit against eight different chemical companies, on behalf of everyone in the United States. Dark Waters reinforces so much of the sad state of affairs we face in our country, brace yourself for your own reality check. Mine was Teflon in Safeway. Yours could be pretty much anywhere given the pervasive use of toxic chemicals. Choose your poison. On top of a bleak glimpse at the squalid underbelly of capitalism, the movie plods along dragging us through a visual timeline that starts in 1975 and phases out at 2015. I found myself calculating how many dreary years were left. If you’re hoping for an Erin Brockovich happy ending, best stay home. Dark Waters is a depressing commentary on the staggering power of corporate greed. PFOA, a chemical compound engineered to create fabulously successful Teflon is now used in everything from raincoats to pizza boxes, infiltrating 99% of human life. DuPont wields so much influence at the highest levels of government that the conglomerate can freely produce this chemical poison, still completely unregulated, without so much as a personal injury shrug. DuPont even ran and then concealed their own studies that conclusively linked PFOA to employee illnesses and birth defects. Now we all know about it. Yet, nothing changes. Surely, for the sake of public health we can do better! Sadly, it doesn’t appear to be a matter of can’t so much as won’t. A Nov. 19 letter written by 17 West Virginia Republicans to the U.S House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Reform, which had a hearing earlier that day, “Toxic, Forever Chemicals: A Call for Immediate Federal Action on PFAS,” had very little to say about the hearings, but did come out swinging at the film, “We ask that you be aware that the PFAS-centered film ‘Dark Waters’ irresponsibly uses tired stereotypes about the people of West Virginia. The film’s portrayal does not reflect reality and can do real damage to our economy…So either the filmmakers are fabricating science or they are relying on vulgar stereotypes to sell movie tickets. Neither is acceptable to us. An irresponsible film like ‘Dark Waters’ puts tourism jobs at risk based on a lie.” Based on a lie…Is this our legacy? ",
