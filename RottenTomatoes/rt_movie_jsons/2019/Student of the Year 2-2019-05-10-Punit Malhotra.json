The story feels completely uninspired and the movie is devoid of any real heart and soul the first movie had. The first movie is far from a great movie, but I still found some enjoyment in it because I liked the characters and was pretty entertained by the premise. This movie just didn't engage me because it lacked any real focus on what it wanted to be about. The characters are paper-thin, and not particularly likable. I will say the one good thing about the movie is that it unintentionally hilarious at times and it felt like something that was so bad it's good in certain moments. Overall, this movie is a poor representation of what Bollywood can be and is mostly a waste of time.",

The only reason why anyone could've wanted to watch the movie is because of the immense amount of publication done by the Dharma Group. Tiger Shroff once again went in with the stunts he does everytime, while Ananya Panday and Tara Sutaria were 2 damsels in distress, both in the plot as well as in their acting. Hats off to the producers in making such a disastrous film. Loved it!",

While the cast & visuals are enticing to the eyes, the movie falls short in story, acting, and a improper misuse of new comers such as Ananya Pandey or Tara Sutaria, who are unfortunately tied down to such characters that have less dialogue more dance numbers. Tiger Shroff excels in his art of gymnastics and dance, yet it's disappointing to see so much potential go towards a movie that does not do his stardom any justice. His acting skills have matured since Heropanti, but he still has a long way to go. Overall, I was not as invested in this one as the first installment of SOTY",
