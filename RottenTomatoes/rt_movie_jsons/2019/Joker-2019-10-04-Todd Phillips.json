    "summary": "Forever alone in a crowd, failed comedian Arthur Fleck seeks connection as he walks the streets of Gotham City. Arthur wears two masks -- the one he paints for his day job as a clown, and the guise he projects in a futile attempt to feel like he's part of the world around him. Isolated, bullied and disregarded by society, Fleck begins a slow descent into madness as he transforms into the criminal mastermind known as the Joker.",

I found the Joker to be VERY SIMILAR to Shark Tales protagonist, Oscar. Could this film secretly be the human version of Shark Tale? I think it could be. The parallels are undebatable. This film is the ULTIMATE inspiration for sigmas such as myself. When I see The Joker (or should i call him Oscar now?) I see a role model, someone to look up to. I hope i can see myself in them both one day. \nYours faithfully,\n-Shark Tale fan 001",

Second best behind heath ledger but you can't stop ledger now can you. The story being told from jokers lens when you really don't get any other lens and scenes made up in his mind that later make you go, \"oh that makes sense now\". Exploring the more sensitive and vulnerable side of the joker and giving him a more \"human\" approach was perfect. You can sympathize with him a lot of the time and feel bad for him with all he goes through. A great movie with almost perfect acting.",

Joaquin Phoenix's performance as the Joker is absolutely outstanding, and it's clear that he put a lot of effort into bringing this iconic character to life. One of the things I appreciated about this movie was the way it explored the character's backstory. It was interesting to see how the Joker became the person he is, and how his experiences shaped his worldview. The film also does an excellent job of examining the societal issues that contributed to the Joker's descent into madness, making it a thought-provoking watch.",

Robert De Niro also gives a great performance, the scene near the end of the film with him and Phoenix is very intense. If you haven't seen this yet give it a go! If you enjoy darker superhero films or thrillers, you should enjoy this.",

            "content": "A surprisingly well-acted and well-written story, Joker tells the tale of the origin of Batman's greatest nemesis. Joaquin Phoenix is an absolute force, balancing between completely unhinged and grounded simultaneously. His character's story is, obviously, central to the plot- but not in a way that one might expect. Instead of showing us the Joker's early days of crime, viewers are treated to the days even earlier than that when Arthur Fleck (the real name for the infamous villain) struggles with mental illness amid a world that could care less whether he lived or died. And that's where Joker gets its real grit and nuance from- the idea that mental illness is something that can be, and should be, ignored. In its mythos Gotham, as a city, is protected by the Waynes, but the reality is much more bleak. Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) runs for Mayor amid his lavish excesses, a race that itself is lavish, while the underbelly of Gotham continues to swell which leads to Joker's thesis argument: That it's the rich and not the poor, downtrodden, and sick of Gotham that are in fact ruining the city. The one percent continues to party while the rest of us are left to rot with no consideration for what that might mean. These pieces set the scene for a more sympathetic and understandable Joker, one whose madness has reason. Phoenix is joined by the always-excellent Zazie Beetz as Sophie, Arthur's neighbor who is perfectly cast and whose story is perfectly paced. The only stumble in this otherwise excellent film is its need to try and shoehorn Bruce Wayne into the project, which it does towards the two-thirds mark. There really isn't any added quality with regard to childhood Bruce, and thankfully the scene doesn't overextend its already lukewarm welcome. Viewers know the universe that they're inhabiting, they don't need such an on-the-nose reminder. Joker still manages to be a force with a relatable angle for the most unrelatable villain in comic book history. Come for Joaquin Phoenix's triumphant performance, but stay for the surprisingly deep message at the core of this \"superhero\" film.",

The way it shows class difference, corruption and how rich and talented rule others around them is not exaggerated and that's what makes it different. It's BELIEVABLE.

On the techinical side, filmography and sound design are very solid and overall add to the movie. A quality reimagining of an already known fictional world, Joker is not just another two hour time-waster like DC's well-known failures in the world of heroes, but a successful establishment of a new universe to be admired.",

If the character of The Joker in this film was just Aurthor Fleck, and didn't wear clown makeup, well, it'd be kind of a skip-it affair, I think. But since he decides to wear clown makeup and call himself The Joker, and this is Gotham City, people clamor for it. I guess I just don't get the hype and don't feel that the film stands up on its own feet outside of the lore of the comics. I also find it kind of hard to swallow that this version of the Joker could become the criminal that takes on The Batman. This version was more straight up insane than insane and brilliant i.e., Ledger and Nicolson versions.  Overall, this is an extremely overrated affair and really quite boring.",

The performance of Joaquin Pheonix is still honestly amazing and honestly if you don't care for the movie and its contents most can agree Joaquin Pheonix provided a beautiful performance.",

Lastly, there was so much more that could have made the film better, the artistic dancing and self face-downs could have taken a seat on the bench, it almost makes it as a completely brand new never before imagined Joker, which I though was refreshing to say the least, there's only one problem, it was never broken in the first place.",

That said, it's hard to tell what the point of this movie is.  It goes to pains to show that an uncaring and judgmental society will let down its vulnerable members, risking turning them into monsters.  Yet the tone feels intent on elevating the Joker to some sort of hero or role model -- never mind the fact that he's a violent and unstable murderer, someone ready to drag society down into chaos rather than put in the work to fix its shortcomings.  One wonders if the legions of fanboys with Joker posters hanging on dorm walls will come away thinking the government should expand funding for mental health services, or maybe engage that sad loner on a bus in pleasant conversation, or if they'd rather just pump their fists at the idea of a madman making the world worse.  My bet is on the latter, and for that reason I struggle to find redeeming qualities in this film.",

It is a deep, violent, gritty psychological character study delving into the mind of Arthur Fleck, a mentally ill man who has only ever wanted to make people laugh, to bring colour and joy to the world, but who has been beaten down again and again until he can take no more, and his life takes a downward spiral when he lashes back at his attackers. I love this film This is one of those film that's performances will make the film or break it. The writing, whilst a little rocky in a few places, is still solid throughout, and when it shines, it _really_ shines. This film would not be the same without Joaquin Phoenix's electrifying performance as Arthur Fleck, absolutely outshining everything else in this movie. Phoenix really put his all into the role, to the point that he is no longer playing the Joker. He is the Joker. Phoenix can and does run through depressed, angry, relieved, happy all in a minute, with nothing more than inflections in his voice and his facial expressions. The little details make it all the better. Watch out for a scene I call, \"How about another joke, Murray?\". That scene is the definition of an Oscar worthy performance. The movie grips you from start to finish, it manages to take a man who kills without remorse and make you feel for him. This movie isn't trying to make you happy, to make you laugh, it wants to make you uncomfortable, scared, angry and it succeeds at all of these from beginning to end.  You will sit down and instantly feel uncomfortable. As the film progresses you will feel sympathetic for Arthur getting beaten down by everyone around him, you will leave feeling empty. This film perfectly embodies the famous quote,\n\"We all can go insane with just one bad day.\" If you can handle violence and dark themes and are at all interested in this film, I recommend you trust your instincts and give it a watch as soon as possible. You will not regret it.",

One of the main criticisms I felt is that while the characters background is looked at, I feel it leaves the viewers with far too many unanswered questions and its the enigma aspect that makes him someone to be so fearful of. It doesn't help people with mental illness to be seen, yet again, as people to be fearful of, people who must be unbalanced and ready to attack at a moments notice.\n\nThe feeling of uncertainty, of some form of impending sudden movement, is present throughout. Its certainly a gripping watch, its relatively tense and edgy too, as should be expected, of course. There's an operatic/choreographed flair type element to said characters public appearances, which appears to come naturally to the actor, Joaquin. Its a good film - quite atmospheric and engrossing. This isn't a film for youngish teenagers, its quite gritty and bleak, hence the 15 rating but thats perhaps to be expected(?).  Its much less a superhero film in the traditional sense but again thats perhaps to be expected. Its a film well worth seeing if you know what to expect, in which case then yes I would recommend it.",

The Joker has always been a sort of unexplainable phenomenon, with no name and backstory seemingly, he was always more mysterious. They give him all that here and it's done really well. Arthur is an interesting and tragic person, Mentally unstable and continuously brought down lower in lower because of increasingly terrible situations he finds himself in until he finally snaps. Now this movie doesn't make you think he's a good guy now, no, the movie just makes you understand joker. Not to mention the visuals are stunning and brilliant, with a lovely new look for the clown prince of crime and a pretty good score.

There's like a little bit too on the nose \"rich vs poor\" revolution anarchy kinda put in to this movie awkwardly which is why this score goes down.

The cinematography is gorgeous in an eerie way, and the props and special effects really bring out the 60s vibe that the film tries to portray. The story is incredibly moving and has many thought-provoking messages throughout, giving the whole film a more horrifying aspect as it can get frighteningly realistic and disturbing. My main issue with the movie, though, is that sometimes it does get way too over-the-top with certain events and the fact that little to no consequences come of it. I also really didn't like the random injection of the Wayne family in this; it just felt too unnecessary and very forced in.

It is an overlong Oscar-baity origin story/ character study of the most over-used character in the Batman cannon. It is cliched, predicable, and transparently pandering to pretentious peacocks successfully by parroting far better movies, which (SURPRISE!) most of them have not seen, even as it erases essential elements from the DNA of it's titular character. Joker,\" is like its namesake in that it is s a calculatedly combustible, mostly competent cocktail, a poisonous potion provided to stir up toxically political polemics on both sides and ride the wave of controversy to the top of the Box Office-a chaos driven scheme as worthy of the Joker moniker as Arthur Fleck is not. Instead of this trite, Nolan/Scorsese-esque crimeshit, smart potential viewers should re-watch Taxi Driver instead, because if backstage political drama is enough to make you flock to this flick and flood it with critical praise, you just might be as disappointingly relevant but as unrecognizably dumb as the the Joker in 2019.",

Joaquin Pheonix's performance as Arthur Fleck was pure perfectness. His performance truly captured the depression and psychopathic sides that Joker portrayed, unlike anything we have ever seen from Joker before on the big screen. It gave us a new perspective to this complex character, told the origin story of one of the most iconic villains in comic book history, while still possessing the classic Joker vibes from previous films and comic books. Although I personally think that there are a small few movies that outdo Joker, this film was an amazing story that was gripping, crazy, and unpredictable. Joker is a true masterpiece, 9.6/10, definitely recommend.",

This movie is extremely confusing, Bruce Wayne and his parents are in this movie, so I figured that it has too stay true too the Batman movies. It doesn't though. From beginning too the end it's a terrible story that doesn't promise anything but boredom. I thought about turning this movie off at one point, but I thought it would turn things around farther on. It only got weirder and weirder. This is one of those movies that we can do without. I'm glad that the filmmakers aren't planning a sequel and making it a standalone movie. Yikes, this movie didn't really do anything for either Joaquin Phoenix or Robert De Niro. The acting is okay, but it's very amature like, and the only thing that the filmmakers who made this movie want from you, is your pocket full of cash. The story is all about Arthur Fleck descending into madness after he loses the only few good things that he had in his life, and this is a movie that bothers me, because it doesn't stay true too the Joker character that we all know and love in the Batman movies. The filmmakers wanted too humanize the character and have the character have a medical/mental condition that makes him have uncontrollable laughter, and is part of the reason why he becomes the criminal that he becomes. I borrowed this movie from one of the libraries and I'm happy that I didn't rent or buy this movie for a price. Do not rent or buy this movie on DVD, Blu-Ray, 4K Disc or Streaming, it's not worth anyone's hard earned cash. I don't recommend that anyone sees this, I do recommend that they skip this movie and look for another one that makes sense, and a story that is worth your time.",

I get that in a mainstream view, people just thought this thing was deeper than it really was but my initial reaction to the movie was... that it was cringey.\n\nThis was mostly overhyped but pretty good.  Definitely very self-serving for Joaquin Phoenix and that was obvious throughout the movie.  His acting was pretty good, but people are out here pretending like it was much better than it was.  Didn't really feel like it was really part of the Joker's actual origin story as it had no relevance to the broader Batman storyline or universe.  \n\nLots of cringey scenes that edgelords will rant and rave about, re-enact, for decades to come.  Overall, it was pretty entertaining but it didn't hit the way I think they thought it would hit.   I was kind of more just laughing at it as an attempt to be this really deep story more than anything.  Its the \"We LiVe In A sOcIeTy\" meme in movie form, where they think they are telling a deeper story, showing a deeper sadness, than they really are... for example, the choice to make him have a tick/disorder that makes him laugh is so obvious.  \n\nI do like the attempt to illuminate the struggles of mental illness and how it can progress over time, and I think most people who have experienced mental illness can relate to aspects of it, but they also missed the mark here.  I think people in general will find it enlightening in this way, if they haven't went through it themselves, which greatly contributes to the many 5 star scores you see here.  Its a learning experience for some that kind of makes them think its deeper than it is.\n\nHowever, I watched this years ago and remember just thinking it was so contrived but pretending to be so unique and deep, but still kind of good despite all that.  Reviewing now as I just saw it pop back up on streaming... IMO, its not rewatchable, not the best Joker performance by a mile, but something you should give a watch at least once.  Of course, the blaring plot holes and inconsistencies with the Batman universe only made things worse and took you out of the movie, like with Bruce Wayne's age.  Its like watching a really well done movie written by an edgy middle schooler, thinking they are getting across some powerful message but really they have no message.  And no, I'm not just missing the point, they missed the mark.",

One bad day can turn anybody into a monster. Arthur is a great Joker, on par with heat ledger in my own opinion. A lot of dialogues and speechs about Mental illness here and there. A lot of things make sense, but like a lot of other movies or tv shows, its not the best representation of mental illness. The actors are all amazing. Some may say its not only one bad day that turned Arthur into joker, this is true, his entire life was hell but one day truly pushed him over the edge. Loosing his job destroyed him even more and made his day being the worst of all. 1989, throw someone into a chemical bin, create the joker. in 2019, throw someone into socity, create the joker. Joker is heavy on its tone, using music to tell the story further then words or pictures. Its not a super hero movie or a super vilain movie, its a movie about a human being destroyed enough to bring chaos in his life. The few actions pieces were well done and served the plot the proper way. The story give enough hints on what is on arthur mind and what is real. R rated for good reasons, its not a child movie, its a dark and mature movie for a mature audience. The movie speaks about lot of social issues without driving agenda down our throats. One of the best movie ive ever seen, i recommend it to everybody that hasen't watch it yet. Your two hours will go fast!",

I agree with a lot of people that he deserves an award for this (or at least a nomination.) The plot itself is a poignant origin story about Gotham's most popular villain. The fact that Batman isn't even in this movie proves that it's possible to produce a successful stand-alone \"super-villain\" movie. More than that, it's also an in-depth case study about mental health. It also touches on bullying, moral values and the ills of society. It's not as violent as some audiences claim it to be, but there are a few scenes that might shock you. It has lessons to share about how criminal minds work and how people can be pushed to their limits. I believe it's also a case study about differences in social classes and how each class has its own good and bad side. Very interesting and quite moving to watch. Highly recommended even for non-comic book readers.",

His character has almost every mental disease. Phoenix is exceptional. The other roles, including De Niro, are minor.

With a great story, great acting, and cinematography that brings the entire movie together perfectly, I can only suggest seeing this movie. That said this is not a family movie, this is not a movie for kids in any way, this is a dark film that while not scary, is not meant for younger audiences.

If you can see the movie in theaters, I highly suggest it, otherwise find a way to see it whether it be on Blu-Ray or streaming when its released. Joker is one of my top films this year.",

It was mostly a study in mental illness- how it happens, and what can become of it...Its so well done, you can't help but stick around to see how it all ends up- to see what that climax is.

            "content": "The film, the Joker, is about Arthur Fleck. For a living, Arthur works as a clown who deals with mental illness. He lives in Gotham City with his elderly mother and must take care of her. Arthur is constantly mistreated by society which is present throughout the film. When his social worker tells him he won't be able to get his medication anymore because the government is shutting them down to save money, this creates a major impact on Author and other citizens in Gotham who deal with mental health problems. This film has caused controversy because some believe it could give people ideas of mass shootings. The movie did not motivate mass shootings. It also did very well in theaters and many people, even if they don't know anything about DC Comics, really enjoyed the film. The Joker also had a very successful box-office run and won awards. The twists and surprises in this movie make it worthwhile and will have the audience on the edge of their seats. \n\tThe opening scene of the Joker sets a dark tone for the rest of the movie. It shows how society treats people like Arthur and makes the viewer feel bad for him. Joaquin Phoenix who plays Arthur, was an incredible choice for this role. Joaquin's movements, emotions, and laugh really made the viewers sympathize with him as well as really helped the Joker come to life. The card Arthur must give to those who are confused why he is laughing is significant. This was a great way to introduce Joker's iconic laugh to the audience and to the citizens of Gotham city. A significant action Arthur does in the beginning of the movie is using his fingers to make himself smile while in clown make up. The reason this is important is because he is putting on a mask to make it seem like he is happy but, on the inside, he is struggling. Later it shows Arthur in his apartment with all his medication he has to take which makes him feel like he is just going through the emotions. The first subway scene shows how Arthur is being picked on because of his mental illness by laughing in a serious situation. This causes Arthur to make a rash decision and causes an uprising. The director Todd Philips did an amazing job picking the cast members. Each scene was important to this story as it went on. The close ups and zoom-ins, like Arthur sitting on the train after getting told he will be on the Bill Murray show, show how important and make you focus on that detail. After, Arthur goes to the Arkham Asylum, one of the many important parts in the movie. In this scene Arthur realizes about his past and what his mother, Peggy, went through. This scene is also huge because mental illness is a big issue in society today and makes people realize how big of an impact it can have on people. When Arthur leaves the Arkham Asylum you begin to piece together the hallucination he had with his neighbor. This begins to make viewers question what parts were hallucinations and what parts were really happening? The music in that scene is a great choice. The soundtrack to the film all fits together and was picked very well. This film is also interesting because unlike most movies about the Joker he is always battling Batman. But in this it takes place before Batman is Batman. It gives an insight into why the Joker became a villain and shows at one point he was a member of society, following the rules of Gotham. Another scene that was created well was when Arthur starts to transform into the Joker, by dying his hair and putting on clown makeup. Another scene is when he is dancing down the staircase. This scene is powerful because he is in his suit, clown makeup, and green hair. The music for this scene pulls it all together, it was a great choice and his dancing to the music is perfect. This is also showing his transformation from Arthur into the Joker. The scene on the subway when everyone is wearing a joker mask is powerful. This helps Arthur escape from the police, and it shows people turning on the police as well. The riot in the subway helps the cause of Arthur. The slow motion of him walking away from the subway while police run into the subway shows how confident Arthur has become and how much more confident, he is becoming. When Arthur is being pulled out of the cop car by fellow rioters and is placed on the hood of the car is symbolic. This is symbolic because there are citizens of Gotham who believe Arthur is right about the way Gotham is being run, which ties into his later encounters with Bruce Wayne. When Arthur uses his own blood to put a smile on his face and the crowd cheers, is the point when Arthur is no longer in control and the Joker has now taken over. The song \u2018That's Life' is a great fit for this movie, which is played a few times throughout. It represents how even though society has not been kind to Arthur or others like Author, he still persevered through it and is taking actions into his own hands.  \n\tOn a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the highest score, I would rate this movie a 10. This movie can relate to issues in society today and is a realistic portrayal, unlike a lot of villain movies. It was directed incredibly well, and each scene is important to understanding the character arc the main character goes through. It also brings up mental illness which is an incredibly big issue today. Although Arthur's mental illness is very extreme, it still sheds light on how impactful it is on people. The background music in all the scenes match perfectly with the characters' attitude and show the seriousness of each situation. This really helps show how Arthur transformed into Joker and even when he wasn't telling you still understood the emotions he was feeling. It also shows how little Gotham did for the poor and mentally ill citizens. Todd Philips did a great job with bringing his idea to life and making people empathize with Arthur Fleck.",

I don't know really the comic books and if everything of it is accurate but from the Batman movies I've seen, it seems pretty alright. But, the thing that makes it so good is not this, per se. It is how they Todd Philips translated the story in this film. Every moments of this movie were wonderful, except the stairs moment that was not the same level as the rest the movie. That scene didn't have the right music or the right camera so it was less enjoyable. The music accompanied perfectly the impressive visuals. Yes, the visuals are for me very incredible. The colors and the camera angles are chose so precisely it is just awesome (except the stairs scene). To continue, Pheonix does a oscar wining performance for sure. We really empathize for the Joker that is suppose to be the bad guy because we really see the effect of society and his childhood on his mental health. He reflects perfectly the emotions that I needed to empathize with his character and that is what makes his acting so on top. After that, the story is perfect and it succeeds perfectly at creating a dark, gory and bloody atmosphere that I very much like. \nA wonderful movie.\nP.S.: I can't help it but laugh when Arthur kills the man he was working with before because of the midget that can get to the lock.",

I've never read as much bollocks in all my life.\n\nJoker is genius. It's the best \"Origins\" film I've ever watched. The utter despair of a man blighted by a \"condition\" that has led to him being one of the worlds \"\u00fcntermensch\", has you empathising with Arthur Fleck: He's been brought up to believe a lie, he's been brought up to believe the world hates him, and he hates the world. The \"have's\" treat him like shit, and he fantasises of a time when he shows those privileged bastards that \"every dog has his day\". He dreams of fame, of infamy, and he gets it. \n\nJoaquin Phoenix has never and will never play a part with such utter honesty. I believed every maniacal laugh, every punch thrown at the world, every expression of disappointment at how the world has let him down. He was just fucking phenomenal, I can't stress enough how good Phoenix actually was in this film.\n\nThe final furlong concluded the fantasy. The alter ego gave him power, control, and a route to infamy. He had roused the rabble, he had promoted revolution-the have-nots were fighting back against the system that had given them so little. The point where Joker had transcended his shit, unfulfilling, deluded, and disadvantaged life was a scene that left me punching (metaphorically) the air in support of Joker. He'd shown those privileged pricks that there was a new Sheriff in town.\n\nJoker should be 6 out of 5 stars. It's a truly amazing film. It's dark as fuck, but for fuck's sake, don't we adults want dark? So refreshing that Joker wasn't a camp, Cesar Romero-type cartoon of a character. \n\nBravo.",

Joaquin Phoenix's version is a slightly effeminate, psychopathic, social misfit that is easy to believe might snap and become a killer, but more difficult to believe would also be the calculating mob leader with a bent for humour that the Joker character is supposed to be. Phoenix gives a solid performance, but it is monotone, so I was surprised it won the best Actor Oscar. Personally, I was much more taken by Heath Ledger's dark, brutal version. The film is slow moving and focuses too much on the mental health decline of the central character, which becomes tiresome by about the halfway point in the movie. This Joker doesn't do anything particularly clever, and although the film deliberately avoided the inclusion of Batman, without Batman it feels like it is missing something.",
