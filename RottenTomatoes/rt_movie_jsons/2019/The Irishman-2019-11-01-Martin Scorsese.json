What's going on? Wait I don't even care. Why was Joe P. made into a soft spoken boring guy? Every other film he was irate which is what he's good at, so frustrating. Everyone in the movie was just too old, boring, soft spoken. The film doesn't work because they're trying to cram the history of the mafia into a 3 1/2 hour time limit, so what you get is a jumbled mess. Big mistake was having all these 80 year old famous actors. They should've had younger ones play them in earlier scenes. Wow how ridiculous was that seeing a guy whose like 75 play a 30 year old, good lord.",

            "content": "when Frank said \"I'm sitting there\", I knew shit was gonna go down and it's gonna break my poor little soul. and on rewatch, it just gets worse. it is at this moment you realise why Frank insists on sitting in the backseat of the car when he, Sally and Chuck are going to pick up Jimmy to \"straighten things out\". it is at this moment that is so crucial in understanding the exact level of humanity that frank has.\n\nI think this 3.5 hour film feels more like a 3 hour film because of the legendary presence of the big three Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci all paired up with the living legend Martin Scorsese. I probably haven't seen a 3.5 hour film (though they are few in numbers) move as fast as this one does just because it's so riveting. the story of Jimmy Hoffa is provided to the audience with such meticulous craft that I basically was in the world created by Marty for almost the enitrety of the runtime. it was also so refreshing to see actors of such huge calibre be back in their A-game after so long because DeNiro has been in some really crappy movies as of lately (most of them being comedies) and Pesci is basically retired at this point.\n\nas for the performances, DeNiro is the best he's ever been and Al Pacino is just what I wanted him to be. he screams, he slams his hands on the table, he points towards everyone in the room and says his dialogues with a sense of sarcasm in them. he might come off as over the top to some people but for me, it's the kind of over the top that I love him for. Joe Pesci, on the other hand, is the real show-stealer for me. he is fucking cold. he is the kinda guy who, if double-crossed, would kill you and your entire lineage and wouldn't blink an eye. in fact, he would eat dinner after that, take a shower and go to bed. he is that cold. I loved his performance the most.\n\nmy favourite thing about this film though, is the occasional, trademark, scorsese's bloody violence each of which is set up perfectly through long drawn out sequences and just, pay off so well. one other thing is the final shot of the film. it reminds of Scorsese's past work The Departed, whose final frame was just perfect to look at. similar to that, this film also has a perfect final shot which is emotional and at times, terrifying to look at.\n\none thing that bugs me personally though, is that, I can't really recommend this film to anyone because this film isn't really made for everyone. I have a personal bias towards scorsese as a director and these actors in general. but believe me, when I write this review, I tried my best to avoid those biases getting in the way of the review, but even without those biases, this film is hard to recommend to somebody. people might find a 20 min long sequence of build-up meaningless and a waste of time which I found riveting and some of the best build-ups I've seen in a long time and they might think this film is just pretending to be genius.\n\nanyways, I'd still recommend you see it. it's a legitimate piece of art.",

Stephen Graham's dynamic appearances briefly evoke Scorsese's past glories but its soon back to the laboured script and superfluous characters.

The attention to detail in all the accessories, from the suits, cars, jewellery and furniture is just astonishing (Although my judgement on 50s props might not be the most accurate). \nThe depiction of how casual and un-dramatic hits on certain target were, made the overall course of the movie very mob traditional. \nPacinos profanity and ignorance brought so much life to Hoffa, a truly pulling character! Joe Pescis calm and collected way of portraying this Bufalino mob head brought new levels to this type of character in my opinion. \nCant really miss with a cast like this under Scorsese\u00b4s direction! \nPersonally I dont have anything against 3 hours and 20 min, but I definitely felt the retention drop at certaint points in the movie.",

This is another Martin Scorsese epic, pulled off with the same energy and majesty of Wolf Of Wallstreet. This is the pinnacle crime/mob movie, as you truly follow every aspect of these characters, and with each passing minute you lose yourself in the film to a point where the characters are no longer characters but living breathing people who you really feel like you are following around through their shady and gruesome journey through the inner workings of their crime family syndicate. Scorsese nails it here, along with the amazing cast of legends like Al Pacino, Joe Pesci, Robert Deniro, and many others who lend their talents to this incredible story. If you haven't yet find the time to sit down and watch this must see epic, you won't be disappointed! I give The Irishman a 10/10.",

The movie brings the audience through the stories and events of Frank Sheeran's life, and the struggles of obtaining and maintaining the title of Hitman for the Italian Mafia. The movie has amazing CGI and amazing story telling. They do a wonderful job of making this a wonderful story, my only problem with the movie is it is obsurdly long.

Which is not to say it's a bad movie - I don't think that would even be possible, with the players involved. But it's a plodding, hazy, thinner-than-it-looks affair, and though its dull pace and meandering plot is meant to be the point - this is the rumination of a man at the end of his long life - that doesn't save it from what it is. \n\nAs a character study, it's interesting in places. Frank is a chillingly blank soldier whose eventual grief at the one job he never wanted to do is marked in its uniqueness, and De Niro plays him well, Joe Pesci has more to latch onto with his soft-spoken boss, Russell. and Pacino is his Pacino-est as an explosive Jimmy Hoffa. Speaking of whom, it's in conveying the history that features prominently throughout the story where comes up shortest. Covering decades of tumultuous goings-on, perhaps it bit off more than it could chew, because the brush strokes are too airy; we get no real sense of the weight of these events.\n\nGranted, this is in parts by design. Frank and Russell are largely untouched by these momentous events, though Hoffa, being a real historical person, is deeply entwined. Yet we never really get a sense of the man's importance. His rock-star status in the Teamsters is conveyed largely by reaction shots at rallies, but you never get much to explain why these people love him. Tough luck if you don't already know; The Irishman is not here to teach you.\n\nThis has been mentioned in other reviews, of course, but it bears repeating: The Irishman also has a woman problem. It bears repeating, because it takes a woman to complete one of the film's most poignant and necessary scenes, wherein one of Frank's daughters takes him to task for his ways. In a quiet, tearful, tragic manner, she explains to Frank the devastating effect his violent life and thoughtless behavior has had on his own family. Not even Harvey Keitel's Angelo Bruno corners Frank so well, in the scene where Frank discovers he bombed the wrong place. For his transgression against Bruno, Frank is forgiven. For terrorizing his daughters, it's much too late, even if Frank could bring himself to regret anything he's done. It's a great scene in a film well-stocked with them, but unfortunately, they don't add up to a great movie.",

Before I get into the review, I would say the only reason why I didn't give it a full 10 is because it feels a little longer than needed. Other than that, this film is a journey that you need to watch. Like Goodfellas and Casino, Scorsese dives into the crime world, and shows the life of a man who is within it. Robert Deniro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci deliver some of their best performances of their career's. Each person lives through their characters, and we get to see some real fleshed out character arcs through the run time. The movie follows a hitman who starts from humble beginnings as a hardworking driver to becoming a main cog in the gang underworld. Unlike some of his earlier work, Scorsese doesn't try to speed up the proceedings with quick cuts or fast camera movements. This film is a definite slowburn, and it might feel like a long watch for some. But if you're a cinematic like me, it feels like a gift from the director. He wants you to be immersed in the story, and take the journey with Deniro's character. The character recounts his life and you get to see how real life events and people affect his livelihood and way of business. One great thing about the film is that it never overreacts or becomes melodramatic. Characters flaring up or going into tension don't automatically start yelling matches or fist fights. The conflicts are show realistically. We get some great writing from Steve Zallian and amazing all around performances from the cast, especially some subtle performances from Ray Romano and Anna Paquin. The set designs transport you to those times, while the CGI that people were worried about doesn't seem that distracting at all. All in all, a really great film. Maybe not one of Scorsese's all time bests, but it holds up there! Go watch it now on Netflix!",

For a brief moment, it can work.  But for long stretches, it just looks, sounds, and feels...FAKE. Dumb.  Imagine if Coppola, making Godfather II, had cast Brando as both the old Godfather and the young.  It would have been almost as bad as this (Brando was younger then than DeNiro is now).  Instead, Coppola made an epic great pic by casting DeNiro as the young Godfather.  Maybe Scorcese is so old now that he doesn't see how terrible this one decision made his movie.  But it just sucked so bad because of that.\n\nStill, if the script had been better, it would have worked.  But there is almost NOTHING to pull you into this movie. Unlike, say, Casino or Goodfellas or the Departed, there is no compelling vivid character or scene.  Everything just reminds you of death, aging and dying.  There are also no female characters who get anything like a developed character to play.  They barely have any lines.\n\nThe script also just meanders...Allegedly, it is supposed to be building to the death of Hoffa.  But it's like bad Shakespeare.  We all see it coming, and yet we have to have a boring game of telephone, where Russ (Pesci) tells Frank (DeNiro) to tell Hoffa (Pacino) to give in to the mob, Hoffa says no, that message goes back, Frank carries back their reply....on and on and over and over and it's truly that dumb and that visually boring.  \n\nThis was almost unwatchable.  It's so bad that it makes you question whether the director still has anything left to say via cinema.\n\nWhat's truly tragic is that, if you had given DeNiro, Pesci, and Pacino age appropriate parts throughout, you might have had a great movie. You'd have to bring in talented actors to play the young parts....but the movie gets a LITTLE better in the last 25 minutes because DeNiro and Pesci are playing characters right around their correct ages, and when that awful fakeness fades off the screen, you see the real talent being wasted, not just the talent of the actors but the director's own still powerful visual sense. The scene where an aging DeNiro falls in his hallway is lit so originally, so beautifully...\n\nBut overall--boring, bad, avoid.",

The story is a corker, interwoven with the biggest events of mid-twentieth century Americana, and with a beautiful score and lovely touches (like freeze-frame captions that tell you the death-by-date of every real-life mobster that makes an appearance - very handy for Wikipedia checks) that pull it along with all the panache you'd expect from Scorsese.

The hardships of family, the mob, and doing what you have to do to get the job done. This movie is tough at times, but that is what it's supposed to be. Mobster movies like this show you the harsh reality of how far this lifestyle can bring onto someone's life. No matter what, it's what it is. Go see this movie whenever possible, you won't regret it.",

This has happened a lot with people claiming to be D.B. Cooper or Jesse James...  It was clear because it portrayed too much nobility for Frank Sheeran.  There are articles that dispute this story.

            "content": "Frank Sheeran (Robert DeNiro) is a hitman entirely driven by his fear of something harsher than death: finality. If there's any truth to religion, death is less an end, more a transition, but finality is an unalterable blackness to which no consciousness will wake from. Of course, death is it's closest relation, and Frank is exposed to a world where death is at the forefront of his reality \u2013 it's real to him in a way it's not to you and I, and he can only carry the attitude as long as it's not me to survive. He probably developed this in World War II, where death was first nature. His killing of two unarmed Nazis, digging their own grave, will be the most buildup we get for any of his kills. In Frank's eyes, this is a story about survival. But for us, it's a story about stories. These are the kinds of stories we tell when we're scrambling to make meaning of life with the looming shadow of death approaching.\n\nMany have widely misinterpreted that this is a film about the events leading up to Jimmy Hoffa's death, but it's not a film about the real Hoffa at all. If anything, it's Hoffa in a dream, filtered through the memory of blood-stained Frank, who knew him well enough to tell tales. It's a story of probability; some things happened, some things didn't, and much was embellished. But aren't stories always embellished? Which is why this film deals with aging, the most natural cause to search for meaning in life. Stories are the spiritual makeup of humanity. Irishman is completely existential in this sense, a kind of primitive art, resembling the core purpose of our ancestors' spiritual mythology. Scorsese has tapped into this deep level of dreaming a movie, the way our early mythmakers saw their worlds and characters come alive, never unrelated to the real world around them. It is a reflection of Frank himself, actually giving his life meaning through telling these stories, whether they're true, untrue, or somewhere in between.\n\nThe film takes place through three timelines: the present, Frank in a nursing home telling his stories; the beginning, Frank's journey from joining the mob through befriending Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino); and the middle, Frank and Russ Bufalino (Joe Pesci) on their way to a wedding, with something much more sinister in the works. Frank started out as a truck driver delivering meat, a brother in Hoffa's union, when fate led him to meeting Russ, the kind of guy who sits next to mob bosses like Angelo Bruno (Harvey Keitel). Frank has a sweetness about him, seems like a harmless guy \u2013 of course he does, this is how he has to remember himself - but for whatever reason he finds himself getting involved in the mob's activities. He's not a particularly ambitious Sam Rothstein (Casino), he didn't want to carve out his life this way like Henry Hill (GoodFellas), and he's not psychotic like Johnny Boy (Mean Streets). Frank is the most mysteriously motivated of all Scorsese gangsters, but circumstances reveal it's always survival [from finality]. At one point, he gets in trouble for blowing up territory part owned by Angelo, though completely ignorant of this. He alludes to having a new child and needing more money as his reason for doing it. And while he should be whacked, Angelo pardons him because Russ vouches for him, just one in a series of events that forge Frank's deepest loyalty to Russ. When he handles things for Russ, it's out of respect, not money.\n\nRuss eventually assigns Frank to be the right-hand man of Hoffa, the union president, and Frank is more than willing to oblige. Frank may not be hungry for power, but he's very appreciative of moving up the ladder. At first, Hoffa just needs some help with rivals, but the problems grow much more complex as he encounters friction within the union, and the mob that's helping him. Frank has venerable memories of Hoffa; a montage of his \"bigger than Elvis\" influence over minions, juxtaposed with sleeping in the same room as him. Their bond grows quickly and personally, developing familial relations. Hoffa's the first of Frank's friends that his standoffish daughter Peggy (Lucy Gallina) is accepting of, as she knows Russ and the rest are gangsters. There's another poignant montage intercutting Peggy's proud school presentation on Hoffa, stating all his idealisms, with the reality of his hypocrisy; building pension fund for workers, but giving it away in loans to the mob. This is no secret to attorney general Robert F. Kennedy (Jack Huston), who interrogates Hoffa about his shady dealings. We know that Hoffa is bound for prison, and this will be a turning point for him, but the question of loyalty will remain: who is, and who isn't?\n\nThere's an invisible food chain, a hierarchy that stretches into the darkness, which we can never fully fathom, but which we hear about. Hoffa still feels like he's in control from behind bars, his puppet Fitz (Gary Basaraba) running orders. But Hoffa slowly begins to find his place on the food chain, and soon, Fitz is responding to orders from elsewhere. A growing union leader, Tony Pro (Stephen Graham), poses a new threat for Hoffa's leadership, despite joining him in prison. They both know they'll be out eventually, and when they are, things will be different. Hoffa's ego can't deal with the power status changing around him, refusing to see the mob taking control of the union, clinging on to his only belief, \"this is my union.\" The more he fights back, the more the mob doesn't like it. And that's when talk begins about the fate of Jimmy Hoffa. Frank is stuck in the middle, his loyalty at stake between his friend and the people who take care of him.\n\nEvery characteristic highlighted is a function of Frank's memory, which fondly recalls Hoffa. Frank may be a hardened killer, unable to feel remorse for his crimes, but he has a soft spot for Hoffa. He remembers him eating ice cream a lot, the chat they shared by their beds in pajamas like boys at a sleepover, and the times he danced with Peggy. Experiencing the fate of Hoffa is heart wrenching, and yet another tale entered into the mythos of his mysterious disappearance. Just the same, there's warmth for Russ, the man who practically crowned an Irishman a made guy in the Italian mob. They were friends until the end. The third act deals with Frank and Russ, geriatrics now, rotting in prison. Watching Frank's senior obstacles pile on, regressing to a helpless state, is the poignancy of a six-film arc; through all the power achieved by illegitimate means, you could never escape the four sufferings of birth, aging, sickness, and death.\n\nScorsese has changed his form, evolving his cinematic style to complement what is likely the last chapter in his gangster saga. It's a shame for anyone to see this without experiencing the full six movements. What it means thematically to his body of work is as important as a chapter is to a book, part of a greater whole. But as with each installment, it never treats itself as a puzzle piece, it is a whole entity unto itself. Mean Streets appropriately began the story with its namesake, the street-level cronies. GoodFellas explored the mid-level mob, while Casino showed the mob with it's own city at the top-level. Gangs of New York brought us back to the 1800s and showed us the historical roots of the mob. And his Oscar-winning The Departed flipped sides to see it from the law enforcement perspective. They've been caught, and now the only thing they can do is rot. That's what The Irishman is; it behaves this way, as age and decline do. Gone is the frenetic pacing, fast editing, and flashy lights of previous installments. The Irishman is finality; the end of an era not just for the mob, but for Scorsese and his crew in this genre. The mastery is in how the film behaves: slow, patient, subdued, clinging to memories; a reflection of the mob's glory days waning. Lower-thirds reveal details about characters we don't get to intimately know, telling us when they died and how \u2013 Scorsese isn't spending his time creating the illusion of glorification anymore. This is the life: death!\nUnlike the unreliable narrator in Henry Hill, whose telling of the lifestyle is contradicted by outcomes, Frank seems honest, but this is only because his unreliability is more complicated, and requires breaking the fourth wall into the real world, where it's been suggested that his confessions are largely embellished. The most important, talked about technique is the use of digital de-aging. Different televisions will have a different effect, but on mine, the image is completely photorealistic. But I also say that if it isn't for you, it doesn't have to be. A slight surreal quality may even be intended; this is an old man trying to remember himself and key players when they were younger, and any imperfections are in him trying to imagine it.\nLife has to mean something. Whether it's picking a green casket over a black one, or a .32 over a .22 caliber gun, the accumulation of all our choices form the unique matrix that tell our story, which is our spiritual energy field. Scorsese, at 77 years old, is right to choose this point in his life to express that. The way Frank prepares for his death may seem hapless and cold, but that's the comeuppance of a man who killed in cold blood, scared his family away, and was drawn into betrayal. Now he's that old man desperate to tell his stories to anyone who will listen. Are we just a bunch of suckers? Probably. We're the last thing Frank needs \u2013 we're sitting on the other side of that fourth wall looking at him, and he's looking right back at us. The last thing he asks for is to keep his door slightly open. It's like if you shut the door, you throw up a border between life and death, and in it he's isolated.

It is painfully slow and insistently pointless, and the plot reads like a first draft run-on sentence, though the acting is fine, with Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci doing pretty well, but still just looking like the weathered statues of gangsters standing out in the rain, which does nothing for the story or the dryness with which it is told, where the editing could have been very helpful but instead actively inhibits the storytelling, and the extensive use of excellent CGI to de-age the main cast 20-30 years makes them look like they're in their late 60's playing characters in their 30's, and the editing isn't bad enough to be funny but isn't good enough to be poor, although Scorsese has an eye for framing and set design that makes the images pop the scenes are ultimately still a very poor level of cinematography because of the still camera and boring staging, and in a movie about gangsters there's no reason to have over three hours of the run time dedicated to meaningless interpersonal politics that don't really go anywhere and never amount to anything more than \u2018this guy doesn't like that guy for no good reason', but doesn't even have the decency to end once the plot has been resolved but drones on and on and on and on until finally.\n\nClosest comparison: It's like a less interesting Casino (1995) with the pacing of 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n\nSetting: Political Drama\nPlot: Gangster\nTone: Drama Epic",

The real star is Joe Pesci as Russell Bufalino, the soft spoken mob boss who becomes Frank's friend and mentor.  Behind the camera, Martin Scorcese makes one of his best films in years, using the story of Sheeran's rise in the mob as a metaphor for greed and corruption, as they more successful Sheeran becomes, the emptier his soul gets (the final scene is devastating).  Whether he is telling the truth about what happened to Hoffa or not doesn't matter, as its more about the corruption a life of crime does to all people.  The one downside is the use of de-aging technology to depict the characters throughout the years, but that disappears after a few minutes, as the acting and storytelling takes over.

After the quick taste that Michael Mann's HEAT had provided in 1995, and the horrible RIGHTEOUS KILL in 2008, one could wonder if we would ever get to see De Niro and Pacino share the screen once again. Thanks to Netflix' deep pockets, Scorsese was able to assemble that dream cast and tackle this decades spanning saga.\n\nTHE IRISHMAN isn't as thorough as CASINO or GOOD FELLAS in demonstrating the inner workings of the mob and, in this case, its influence on the Unions run by Jimmy Hoffa. I learned more about that aspect in a 2006 special report featuring Sheeran's ''confession'' and comments from his lawyer and author of the book ''I Heard You Paint Houses: Frank \"The Irishman\" Sheeran & Closing the Case on Jimmy Hoffa''. It does have the advantage to be based on more recent findings on the case, making it more relevant than Danny De Vito's 1993 HOFFA with Nicholson in the lead.\n\nI would have thought that at 209 minutes, it would have had the time to be a bit clearer on that aspect, but it seems Scorsese was more interested in exploring the characters and their relationships than the mechanics of mob-related shenanigans. And with actors like his leads, delving in character development is a gift.\n\nIn fact the biggest strength and the most obvious weakness of THE IRISHMAN resides in its leads. There is no denying that there is an undeniable pleasure from seeing them work together, and their friendship makes some scenes infinitely more heartbreaking. However, their age (76 for De Niro and 79 for Pacino) makes it difficult, even with the aid of computerized de-aging technology, to make it completely believable that they are, at certain points in the film, at least 30 years younger. Their stance and their overall energy belies their age. It's not a deal-breaker for me, but it made a full immersion in the film difficult.\n\nWhile it doesn't have the vitality of some of his greatest work, feeling much like the film of an older, wiser man than the angry one who made TAXI DRIVER in 1976 or GOOD FELLAS in 1990, THE IRISHMAN remains an important film in Scorsese' career, A film that takes the time not only to explore the actions of its protagonists, but also to linger on the consequences of their actions on them, their family and their regrets.\n\nA younger man wouldn't have made that movie.",

            "content": "Martin Scorsese teams up with Netflix to deliver the captivating crime drama The Irishman.  Based on a supposed \"true crime\" novel, the film follows a teamster named Frank Sheeran who becomes a mob enforcer and goes to work for Jimmy Hoffa.  Starring Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Joe Pesci, and Harvey Keitel, the cast is especially strong and gives solid performances.  Additionally, the de-aging CGI is pretty effective, allowing the actors to play a variety of ages; though there are times where their movements betray their real ages.  The sets and costumes are also well-done, giving an authentic feel for the time-periods.  However, the film is about an hour too long; including a lot of unnecessary and superfluous scenes.  Yet despite a few weaknesses, The Irishman is a compelling film about the toll a life of crime takes.",

It was meandering, confusing, there were so many characters and we had a reason to care about maybe two or three of them. They were introduced so seamlessly I just wondered who those people were. Everyone they cast is a disaster. The actors are good at their jobs, of course, but everyone's way too old, and kind of too famous. They make everyone look older just fine, but De Nero has like an 8 year old daughter, and he still looks 70. It's jarring. Even the extras are too old. His daughter comes in, and I was like, Rogue? They pick some fantastic songs, but the overall sound design is so poor that when they come in they're jarring. There was a really funny scene toward the end about a fish in a car, and I just thought, this is a good scene, why couldn't this whole movie be good?",

But then you went on about 40 minutes too long, the make-or-break period. Being old is not a punishment for a life of crime and becoming old is not near the revelation that Scorsese finds it nor makes it out to be. Being old, sad, and alone is what happens either way no matter what. I get that he was trying to show that crime didn't pay, but it kinda did. It's hard to feel bad for him because not many people were fortunate enough to have the chance to grow old. Life is precious, even when dull and lonely. It's not a punishment for the life you've led or karma that you're gonna die eventually because heck, we all are! It's well made up to that point, but then like Silence, it flounders at the end because it misunderstands what it was all for. This is because Scorsese didn't REALLY live it, or in Silence's case write the novel it was based on and understand the philosophical meaning behind it. I think Scorsese needs someone to change his diaper on this one. This is a fun attraction, but there's nothing going on beneath the surface. Funny, because that's what he berates other modern films for doing while he's the only one doing it. He sees in others what he doesn't like in himself. Scorsese usually is pretty good, but he might be losing something. 7.8/10.",

That's why it took so long to write this review out because I didn't want to miss out on fine details that have fixed some plot issues I might have had before, but now putting the bigger picture together it does feel much more cohesive and well-paced, as some details I used to think \ud83e\udd14 should have been cut now feel more integral to the story. It's great to see the classic entourage of Martin make a return from Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Al Pacino, and Harvey Keitel, all do a great job as always in these type of rolls as classic gangsters. The De-Aging technology while seemingly less for the most part but there was just one extreme close up shot lingering on Joe Pesci's face and it all most looked like a very much like a really good cinematic trailer for a video game but maybe that's just me. Everything else from the writing cinematography and editing was very well done with long steady-cam shots being Scorsese forte.

Maybe the story actually did have a discernible plot that revealed itself before 2/3 of the way through it. \nI did the unthinkable: I re-watched it. Yes, folks. I saw this movie twice so you wouldn't have to see it once. It is every bit as bad the second time.\n1st is the de-aging process. If you're going to make someone look forty-five years younger then it's a good idea to also have them move like they're forty-five years younger. Here we see a 75 year old De Niro looking like a 30 year old. Yet when he starts beating on someone he moves like a 75 year old. If you're going to de-age someone then de-age their moves. Either that or get a younger actor. It is shameful that Scorsese would allow this to happen. Did they not see this in the cuts? Did it not occur to anyone that De Niro might not be able to beat someone up like he could in 1990? I thought Scorsese was a better filmmaker than this.\n2nd is the run-time. The first half of the film drags on and on. We get it. He's a truck driver and then becomes a freelance mob enforcer. We didn't need an hour and a half to have that explained to us. We didn't need the story about the family, which is irrelevant even as a sub-plot to the main plot. \n3rd is the aforementioned plot. We don't have any idea what this movie is really about until Jimmy Hoffa finally appears what seems like six hours after the movie starts. Pacino does a good job. I only felt a slight amount of his usual \"Hoo-Ah\" acting style that he developed after Scarface and refined in Scent of a Woman. Maybe we could have had more Pacino and much, much less irrelevant backstory.\nThis movie may have been much better with a two hour runtime. The backstory alone was two hours long before the real plot developed. Through much of this movie I found myself saying, \"who cares? Get on with it!\" Another thing with a semi-historical drama is that we already know what happens. We don't need to dwell on topics which are common knowledge. It just prolongs an already long story. \nScorsese hit it big with a few of his early movies and then really took off with Goodfellas, which for its time was groundbreaking. Since then he has muddled around, often using the same, tired formula. Casino was a way-too-long Goodfellas in Vegas attempt. Gangs of New York was redeemed by the brilliant acting of Daniel Day-Lewis. Otherwise it almost could have been a documentary. The Aviator had a chance to be brilliant, but Scorsese expects us to sit through hours of nothing happening. Only a maturing DiCaprio saved that from being a complete disaster. In \nThe Departed he tried to get too clever. Jack Nicholson's over the top acting didn't help it much. With The Wolf of Wall Street we're brought back to that same Goodfellas formula, but with drugs and stock trading rather than gangsters. And now we get another Goodfellas formulaic movie which is probably the worst of the bunch.\nSome people will like this movie because it is a Scorsese film and only for that reason. If anyone but Scorsese had directed the exact same movie it would be panned in the reviews.",

Maybe too long. 210 minutes are longer than the LOTR-flicks - not counting the extended versions.

            "content": "As cinematic technology and filming methods progress, so does the art of storytelling. This is superbly manifested in Martin Scorsese's bold move by pushing his mob story past the three-hour mark through careful pacing and stellar cinematography. What would seem like a tedious viewing is quite the opposite, as The Irishman provides a gripping tale with likeable characters; personalities that viewers would not soon forget long after viewing this epic tale. Those familiar with Scorsese's method of storytelling and stylistic cues will feel right at home with The Irishman, as the film is arguably the perfect culmination of all that is great about Scorsese. Based on true events, the film follows Irish-American Frank Sheeran, an unassuming truck driver who rises up the ranks of Russel Bufalino's crime family, later becoming one of the top members. Whereas several past films on the subject glorify the mob life in some ways, The Irishman heads in the opposite direction, providing a dark and realistic tale about everyday life as a hitman, government corruption and involvement with crime families, and the intricate hierarchy that Mafia members adhere to. Few films commit such effort to push the audience to acquaint themselves with the characters and perceive the emotions conveyed. Such scenes where we get a glimpse into the thoughts of a man just before he takes a life, the petty rivalries between certain individuals that lead to bloodbaths, or scenes that portray just how unceremonious and brutal mob killings are, give viewers a fresh look at the realities of life in the Mafia and forces the audience to simmer in the dark, awkward atmospheres that the film creates so wonderfully; a goal many similar films fail to meet. Aided by brilliant costume design and a legendary cast, The Irishman is absolute essential viewing for Scorsese fans and is sure to please those craving a dark and immersive epic film noir that will more than likely be regarded as an American classic for decades to come.",

Zero diversity in the cast... because Scorsese told the wrong story. The central story should have been the daughters' lives -- let's see 2 hours of how THEY were affected by this.  Instead, we got seven words from the lead daughter. (2) FRANK WAS A JERK. We got almost 4 hours of a totally unlikable character as the star; who thought that would be a good movie? Oh yeah, the guy who thinks MCU movies are not movies, despite literally everyone on the planet disagreeing with him. (3) PUT A HITMAN ON A PEDESTAL. The movie should have made FUN of the real Frank, who claims he did all these bad deeds when, pretty clearly, he is embellishing many of them. But Scorsese tells the story Frank wanted told. Frank was a hitman who chose the mob over his family. Shouldn't that creep us all out?",

He justifies making another gangster film by tackling more themes and ones even deeper other greats like Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Gangs of New York, the Departed, and more while also alluring to his past. Some of these themes in this movie include power, guilt, loyalty/identity, and more, and Scorsese satisfyingly covers all of them in a wise, reflecting way. He takes his time with a worth-it long runtime. Worst comes to worse, watch it in two sittings. The acting is incredible, some of the best acting by the ensemble of Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Ray Romano, Harvey Keitel, and others. This is up there for De Niro, who really involved himself with the role, and same for Pacino, who only beats this with The Godfather series. And Joe Pesci surpasses his other films and plays a different sort of personality than other roles like Goodfellas. Other than that, cinematography, music, writing, everything all on point. De-aging is not a problem. And, no matter what it seems, despite similar cast, this is definitely not another Goodfellas. It tackles different themes and is even better.

With its 3.5 hour length, Martin Scorsese's latest can be a gripping endeavor at times, chronicling the career of Frank Sheeran and his eventual downfall. I do appreciate that this is a quieter, more contemplative take on a mob story, one that lingers more in the moments with its characters as much as it details the intrigues of their organizations. Robert De Niro doesn't disappoint as \"mostly\" easy-going, loyal Frank Sheeran. Coming out of his retirement from acting, Joe Pesci gives a remarkable turn as Russell Bufalino. In contrast to his memorably bombastic performances in 'Goodfellas' & 'Casino', Pesci's Russell is disarmingly calm and focused. But there is a peculiar coldness about him and a sheltered rage hidden behind his eyes at times that makes you believe this guy will get shit done. Despite the skills of De Niro & Pesci, the chill nature of their characters and the deliberate pacing of the story can lull one to sleep if you're aren't prepared for it. Once Al Pacino comes into the picture, the movie picks up and Pacino is amazing as Jimmy Hoffa. He injects energy & warmth into the proceedings that's rather lacking otherwise; and his interplay with the rest of the cast is riveting. \n\nI have a couple issues with the movie but my main one is about the visual effects used to de-age the lead actors. To be clear, I think the VFX work here is solid & important. I was never drawn-out of the movie because the VFX looked fake. On the contrary, the VFX are nearly seamless. I was distracted by the fact that Robert De Niro & Joe Pesci don't look young enough to be in their 30s or early 40s. The effects on Pacino fair better (the acclaimed actor looking like he did in the late 90s). \u2018The Irishman' might test the viewers patience, depending on their taste or alertness but it well worth a look for Scorsese's command of the production and the performances; closing out in a rather haunting, heartbreaking ending that shows the true consequences of unflinching loyal in a reprehensible line of work. \n\u2013 8/10",

And, although Scorsese may have made one of the longest films I've ever seen, I must applaud him for being able to direct the actors and keep it relatively fresh throughout, but, there were certainly scenes that weren't needed. I will say that I probably have a bias, like many, I watched this in small chunks. I would like to see the movie as a whole, but time just doesn't allow.

When Frank has to kill, it is swift and simplistic. It is not heavily glorified or stylized and instead comes off as shameful. The majority of the film's screen time is devoted to everyday Mafia conversation, although it is never mundane. \n\nThe film's sprawling narrative flashes back to Frank and Russell's first meeting, and at times forward to the nursing home until these storylines converge.

This film reunited the gangster legends of Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci, which just makes this crime epic better and more authentic. The cinematography is pretty beautiful, it's occasionally quite gory and the de-aging of the actors is actually pretty fancy. Overall, this is an ambitious, big budget project from a mastermind of filmmaking, and while some parts are indeed quite long, this is still an impressive gangster pic based on a true story.

Don't be put off by the run time, and don't you dare watch it in parts. Despite its slow burn tale of crime and aging, Steven Zaillian's script, adapted from Charles Brandt's true-crime book I heard You Paint Houses (2004), makes the whole thing fly by.  It's a pleasure to see Robert De Niro, Pesci, Pacino roll back the years, step onto the stage, and give the performances of their careers under the guidance of the director that made them (except Pacino) stars almost forty years ago. About half hour into the film, the camera catches the foxy glint of Harvey Keitel's eyes in the back of the restaurant. He's a mob boss and knows it. I shouted out loud to my family, hey, it's Keitel \u2013 the whole gang is here! Oh, yes, this is going to be bloody good isn't it? The Irishman is the best kind of reunion. It's a retired band coming together to perform not their greatest hits, but a new smash hit album. It reminds you why you fell in love with cinema in the first place and reminds you that there's life in these old dogs yet. Everybody in this film is sensational.\n\n\nREPORT THIS AD\n\nAt the heart of it is Robert De Niro as Frank Sheeran, an Irishman, making meat deliveries and taking a cut for himself because he works hard and deserves it. But when we first meet him it's saggy-eyes and wispy white hair in a nursing home, wheelchair bound and sitting alone, recounting his story inside his head, contemplating the past. We're introduced to the narrative framing of the film which has Frank and mob boss Russell Bufalino (Pesci) going on a family road trip of sorts. The two are a delight here, their eyes glittery with decades of acting nuance. It's like they've never been away. It's a shame Pesci has retired, because he's incredible. His performance is as delicate and wise as his body, with a career-span of intelligence sparkling behind his cool blue eyes. The Oscars surely has his name ready. It's the type of performance that only he could give and could give at this age. It's made possible by state-of-the-art de-aging technology, which better allows Scorsese to explore the effect of looking into the past through the lens of the old and present. It's uncanny when we slip through De Niro's current eyes and into his new pair twenty or so years into the film's past. There's a hint of The Polar Express (2004) about it, but it's all so easily swept aside by De Niro's controlled, devastating performance and Scorsese's assured direction. After ten minutes I never noticed it again. I was in the grip of a master.\n\nAs it flits back and forth between the road trip and Frank's rise through the mob ranks, becoming not only Russell's most trusted client, but his closest friend, the film slowly explores the nature of time as an unstoppable force that is going to catch you one way or another. For the mobsters, if you're not shot on the job, it's prison, and if prison doesn't get you, the nursing home afterwards will. A pitch-black sense of humour flows through the whisky-shot wrinkled veins of The Irishman. Near the end, Frank is told his old attorney has died and that he can confess now because nobody is going to whack him. He asks the detectives, \u2018Who did it?', as if expecting somebody he knows. They stare at him, dead serious, \u2018Cancer.'\n\nThere was a time when all the men Frank knew couldn't be touched, and if you did, you were likely to be shot in the back of the head in your favourite restaurant with your children watching. But in the third act, and the time that Frank recounts his story, that's all gone. The violence, the glamour, the glory, all of it has given way to something more terrifying: time. Frank can only reflect on the past. Scorsese lets us experience it as Frank does, poignantly using technology to turn back the clock of these wonderful stars, letting us relive the gangster epics of old, conjuring up the magic of Goodfellas (1990) and Casino (1995), rocking to the woozy tunes of The Five Satins, but then it's over, and we're back in the nursing home, coming out of Frank's head, staring at nothing with nobody to hold. The film works as well as it does because of its aging stars and director, all of whom have contributed greatly to the crime epics of cinema, and it is fitting that they would all come together to tell a story about what happens when all of this fades like an old photograph. It's Scorsese's late-career masterpiece, and unbelievably, it is made possible by Netflix.\n\nPay attention to all the watches scattered about the film, they're not an accident. And it's not accident when Scorsese lingers on Frank's hand as he places a gun next to a ticking watch. Tick-tock, tick-tock. It means the gun is going to be used soon. But it has further implications by the end of the film. The gun is not the most efficient weapon. It's time. Time always catches up. You can't outrun it; you can only make the best of it. Unfortunately, as Frank falls deeper into the underbelly of America and entangles himself in the affairs of union leader Jimmy Hoffa (a funny and magnificent Al Pacino) he begins to lose sight of his daughter Peggy (later played by Anna Paquin), and quite literally, she drifts out of the film as she has drifted from his life. Paquin barely utters a word in the fragment of screen time that she has, but her presence and the impact it has on the film's closing stages is essential. For all its glamorised violence, and brilliant back and forth wise cracking between its trio of stars, the moments that stay with you are the ones of Frank navigating the lonely, troubling road of retirement. The Irishman is about the past catching up. It's about reflecting on what's lost as you face the final chime of the clocktower. It's achingly sad when Frank visits Peggy late in the film, struggling along on his walking stick, only for her to shut the window and walk away. Frank has lost his chance to rekindle his relationship with his daughter. He spent it all painting houses.",

The gravitas and pathos of the characters, especially Frank, is lost in many scenes. The facial expressions are just robbed. For reference, take the confrontations between Frank and Jimmy (Pacino) or the moment in which Frank realizes that he trafficked arms to Cuba. In addition, the tension between Jimmy and Peggy is not clarified.\nWhere: Netflix\nViews: 1",

When a movie is over three hours long, you can fill it with lots of characters.  It's a great cast. But Joe Pesci (as mob guy Russell Bufalino), De Niro and Pacino each have big meaty roles, and that's always wonderful.  Martin Scorsese handles it all quite well and the story moves along at a somewhat leisurely pace.  He does use the latest aging technology on the faces of the character's when they move through different periods of their lives.

            "content": "Things aren't stated directly in the mafia. They use codes and euphemisms but everyone involved understands clearly. So, when mob hitman Frank Sheeran is told by his boss and longtime friend, Russell Bufalino, \"It's what it is\" about Frank's other longtime friend and mentor, Jimmy Hoffa, his heart crumbles.  Those words signal a point of no return for everyone involved and set into motion the final hour of Martin Scorsese's I Heard You Paint Houses, or, The Irishman. It is also the most poignant and compelling hour of filmmaking of any film I saw from 2019. The proceeding two and a half hours, also excellently done, bring the total runtime to 3hours 29minutes. This is Scorsese's longest film, and, also, one of the best films in the career of one of, if not the, greatest living film directors.\n\nWe learn from an elderly Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro), narrating his life story from a nursing home, that a \"house painter\" is mafia code for a hit man. De Niro's narration is quiet and full of reflection and regret. He isn't narrating so much as confessing. He tells an unseen listener about a road trip he and Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci) took with their wives to attend a wedding, but the real reason for the road trip was \"business.\" The story of the road trip acts a spring board to flashback to the 1950's when Frank went from a union truck driver looking to make extra money to a \"house painter\" to bodyguard and friend of Teamsters Union president, Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino).\n\nThe screenplay, adapted by Steve Zaillian from the book I Heard You Paint Houses by Charles Brandt, allows the characters to build their personalities and inner lives through small moments like conversations in cars or restaurants. The back and forth between the actors bring the characters and the movie to life. There are several scenes that are as tense as they are entertaining, especially Hoffa's meeting with a rival in the teamsters, who arrives late and wearing shorts. It's the kind of scene that Scorsese specializes in.\n\nDe Niro gives one of his best and most \"Robert DeNiro\" performances. Narration aside, he says as little as he can with as few words as he can, even then stammering over phrases. Emotion is just below the surface of a quiet, stony exterior. Joe Pesci comes out of retirement to give one of his best and most unexpected performances. Unlike the hot head tough guy characters he is most famous for, Pesci as Bufalino is a calm tough guy. He never has an outburst or raises his voice but his aura is no less intimidating. Here, Pesci tries to mediates potentially violent situations. He asks an agitated Hoffa if there's \"another reason\" for his actions in such a calm and inoffensive tone you get the feeling that Pesci's version of Bufalino would have been a good therapist or marriage counselor. Al Pacino is over the top as Jimmy Hoffa but his acting style works because the real-life Hoffa was an outspoken, flamboyant, larger than life personality (Jack Nicholson's performance as Hoffa in Danny DeVito's film, Hoffa, is among his most ostentatious). Harvey Keitel, who starred in Scorsese's first film has a small part as the mafia boss, Angelo Bruno. He sits like a king in his restaurant booth exuding a cool but threatening presence.\n\nThe digital de-aging of the actors to make them look up to 30 years younger than their actual ages works well enough; it helps that their ages are never specified. As an effect, the de-aging is far from convincing but not very distracting, except for one shot where young Joe Pesci's face appears to be floating over his body. The overall effect, however, is no different than dying their hair darker. However, the performances do feel richer for having the same actors in the same roles throughout the film.\n\nFilms like Mean Streets, Goodfellas, and Casino (featuring Harvey Keitel, Robert De Niro, and Joe Pesci) have made Scorsese synonymous with the modern gangster picture. Each of those films glamorized the criminal life to a certain extent to show its insidious appeal. There is not a bit of glamour to be found in The Irishman. There is no luxury or appeal to Frank's lifestyle. When not carrying out hits or driving a truck across the country, he acts as a go-between for Hoffa and the mob bosses trying to diffuse potentially dangerous situations.\n\nThe Irishman is an epic film. It sprawls not over picturesque landscapes but a life in crime. It feels episodic, any complete life story would, but it flows smoothly. The doo-wop song \"In the Still of the Night\" by The Five Satins opens the film and plays more like a dirge than a pop song. It sets the tone for the film perfectly. The brilliant score by Robbie Robertson feels like it grew out of the film's contemplative, somber tone. This story explores what it means to survive a life of crime and what it leaves a person with. Frank entered the criminal world to make more money to take care of his family, but there are tellingly few scenes of Frank with his family. What was it all for?\n\nThis is a long movie and it feels like a long movie\u2014I won't argue that\u2014but it is also thoroughly engrossing. I was completely immersed in these lives and this world without ever wanting to be a part of them. The first two-thirds of the film builds up emotions so subtly that you are taken by surprise and overwhelmed when those emotions come into play in the final act. When Frank and Bufalino go to prison, the film doesn't jump over their sentence, we stay with them. Scorsese knows that the real power of this story is to stay with Frank as an old man instead of using a montage or epilogue cards. This biopic of Frank Sheeren is a sad, tragic movie, but it is so well executed cinematically and emotionally that it is a joy to watch. I was reminded of a quote from the great critic Roger Ebert, \"No great movie is depressing. All bad movies are depressing\"",

Then you have the balls to tell Marvel movies they're not original? Are you kidding me? So I'm not going to let your past success cloud my judgement on this one, like the rest of the fours and fives on this site. I'm going hard.\n\nThe story jumps around so much, I thought it was a House of Pain song. Sometimes jumping around helps the plot, but this isn't one of them. If it was shorter, it might work. You can't spend 30 minutes in the present then jump back 10 years for five minutes. Then jump all the way back to the present again. That never works. Ever. You never see that in a Marvel movie. I will give you the wonderful CGI. It was awesome to see that age progression. You know what wasn't awesome? Seeing those effects on a 77 year old. Great he looks like a 40/50 year old, but walks like a 77 year old. I was worried he was going to fall and break a hip. You're not fooling anyone here. They all talk like they're 80. They all have the mannerisms of an 80 year old. You fail there. You should've hired younger actors then made them look older. It would've worked a lot better, but that would mean you have to be friends with younger people. Basically, Scorsese is the Adam Sandler of gangster movies. Start calling you Martin Sandler,cause you just wanted to make a movie with your buds.\n\nEveryone is upset that De Niro didn't get an Oscar nomination. He didn't deserve it. Hell, Sandler deserved it more than De Niro did. Having one line at a time shouldn't cut it. He's a great actor, but that doesn't mean he earned it. What about the narration he did, you might ask yourself. You know as well as I know he read from a sheet for that. It's Best Actor not Best Reader off of a Sheet. I loved how he tried to walk like he was younger. Reminded me of a robot learning to walk for the first time.\n\nSomehow there's two Best Supporting Actor nominations from this movie. I don't understand. I really don't. I'm not mad that Al Pacino was nominated. This year wasn't a great year for supporting actors. I think Brad Pitt has that locked up. However, Joe Pesci does not deserve that nomination. Jimmy Stewart makes one of three faces. Joe Pesci says one of three phrases. He didn't do anything that impressed me.\n\nOverall, I wasn't impressed. I was bored. Grade Patchy. 2 out of 5 beards.",

Honestly, watching the first 85% of this film had me feeling like I had seen this all before in Goodfellas, Casino, The Godfather and countless other mob films. But the last sequence of the film really had me. The film finally presents us with some of the repercussions of these men's actions. And what lies waiting for them as we watch them grow old. For every person that has ever lived, the last sentence of all of their stories ends with a period. And when approaching that finality, how will we feel about the deeds of our lives? Scorsese explores these ideas in one of his more meditative films to date. Excellent writing, brilliant acting by DeNiro & Pesci, and some impressive de-aging CGI. But for me, this film just was what it was.",

Old men cannot move like young men do.  No matter how legendary they are at acting.  The CGI to de-age the faces disappears after a few moments - nice job on that, but the bodies still move like old men and it's noticeable.\n4) I love these actors and they did a fantastic job with this story - but they're about 15 years older now than the characters were when Hoffa disappeared.  It makes a difference.  Particularly with Hoffa.  He was a two-fisted Irishman in his fifties when he disappeared.  Still a physically powerful figure.  Having Pacino play him makes sense in many ways - He's fucking Al Pacino, if he wants to play the teenaged daughter, I'll braid his hair and call him Peggy - but it gave a different feel to what actually happened.\n\nIt's an overall amazing movie, and the addition of Stephen Graham to the Scorsese crew is very welcome.",

            "content": "By now, anyone choosing to go and watch The Irishman knows that it's long. And that's probably a good thing: the viewer knows to prepare themselves. The run-time stands at an intimidating three-and-a-half hours. It's good news, then, that Robert De Niro himself has said it's acceptable to watch the film in several goes. It's not that the film doesn't feel long - it does, and the first half is particularly challenging to endure - but almost every minute on screen feels warranted, necessary even. \n\nIt's challenging for many reasons, not just the film's length. For one, there are so many characters it's hard to keep track of the names, actions, and motives of each.  Another difficulty I had is deciphering the particularly thick and deep accents. But, despite all my hang up about Netflix's role in cinema, watching it there gave me the ability to pause and rewind when I needed to. I chose to use subtitles, too, which made the viewing experience much easier. \n\nThe Irishman is unquestionably epic. It spans five decades, from the '50s to the early '00s. Much has been discussed of the incredible youthification technology which de-ages the lead actors. It's so good, in fact, that the viewer pretty much forgets about it entirely. That's even more remarkable considering the fact that De Niro, Pesci, and Pacino are A-list celebrities, faces we've seen and continue to see on a regular basis. But it isn't just the technology that engenders the de-aging effect, it's also the skill of the actors, who alter their posture, gait, and mannerisms to convincing effect. \n\nAll three aforementioned actors are stellar. De Niro gives a solid performance and is likely (and probably rightly) upset about his not being nominated for Best Actor at the Oscars. Pesci and Pacino are both nominated for Supporting Actor, and both are superb. But it's Pesci who really shines in his role. Whether in acclaimed gangster classic Goodfellas or family favourite Home Alone, we're used to seeing him as an animatedly loathsome criminal, uncouth and loud. But in The Irishman Pesci is different, delivering a career-best performance: quietly sinister, alternating between providing counsel and instructions to kill with frightening indifference. Thank god that Scorsese finally convinced him to come out of (an almost ten year) retirement to make this movie. \n\nScorsese's film is at its zenith is when it's showing us the aged mobsters struggling to make sense of their lives of unspeakable crime, now that death is at their doorstep. Frank Sheeran (De Niro's character) long ago lost the ability to feel remorse for his actions, probably way back in the war, before the film even starts; but as The Irishman reaches its conclusion, and Sheeran finds himself with no distraction and only the stretch of time before his eventual death, he finds himself reflecting on the life he's led. It's devastating and moving to see this man, once clinical and remorseless, grasping to come to terms with what he's done, and to cope with the guilt that he finally seems to feel. The final scenes between the vicar and Sheeran are my favourite in the film. \n\nAn over-busy first half which perhaps lacks electricity transfigures into a strongly meaningful and thrilling second, before it finally opens up into a poignant and profound final act. The Irishman feels like Scorsese's swansong: a final ode to the gangster film.",

As Sheeran climbs the ranks to become a top hit man, he also goes to work for Jimmy Hoffa -- a powerful Teamster tied to organized crime.\n\nThis proves that Scorsese has the skill and longevity to be considered one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. The Irishman is one of Martin Scorsese's best films, that is all that can really be said. He is able to return to the gangster genre with a brand new outlook that makes this film wholly original. The Irishman examines the ideas of death and time through retrospect ; Pesci, DeNiro, Pacino are at the top of their game. The use of Groundbreaking VFX took Anti-Aging to the next level, whether it be from CG or makeup, is overall incredible. The editing is as phenomenal. While featuring three terrific lead performances the film also features many wonderful supporting ones as well. Ray Romano, Stephen Graham, Harvey Keitel, Bobby Cannavale, etc etc!\n\nA fine curated piece of art, that's what Scorsese put before our eyes, he brought out everything in his arsenal of skills, every move is calculated to the teeth, every work is accounted for, it never skips a beat, it comes packaged in a smart setup which is not surprising with a director like Scorsese, in its over three hour runtime, not a single second is wasted, every little thing meant something, every frame worked towards the story, whether it's a one-second still or a ten minutes sequence, everything clicks here.\n\nA blend of historical gangster storytelling with the main character weaving throughout it unobtrusively. Excellent cinematography with authentic backdrops, music, references. Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino, Joe Pesci, Harvey Keitel, Ray Romano demonstrate why they are such revered actors. A brilliant film that is a must see, destined to become yet another Scorsese classic.

It also felt very much like a film, I'm glad it wasn't cannibalised for TV.\n\nIt's a solid film, impressive sometimes and ordinary other times, the Jimmy Hoffa posturing in -front of a microphone business was sometimes a little rote, Pacino coming off a little one-note at first despite the fact that the book hinges on it and it's a story that (as raised in the film) has passed out of public consciousness now. Maybe it's because it's called The Irishman that I went in not expecting it to revolve entirely around Jimmy Hoffa until a wikipedia on the source material afterwards. (Who am I kidding, it was during).\n\nWhich brings me to the Title Card that flashes up: I Heard You Paint Houses, which at first I thought must have been a title card, but by the end I knew was Scorcese being subversive and subtle as usual, having his cake and eating it. I enjoyed that.\n\nMore subversion for me comes in the form of (eventually) Anna Paquin's daughter character. Much maligned recently for its lack of dialogue, I actually think the role has more presence than any of the other nonsense. Most dialogue is as sociopathic and soulless and workmanlike as the man himself, Jimmy a man broken and remade as a killer by the War, and so much of it is meaningless. Anna Paquin's stare, her broken accusatory look, pained but as if suppressing permanently, was actually very powerful, and to be able to link the child and adult actors wih the same feeling inside their characters is an inspired bit of casting and directing.\n\nDe Niro is stunning and every bit the actor throughout that he has been his whole life. Unlike Pacino who blossoms half way through, he's incredible from the start. His V/O is very very good (incidentally the device that makes it look like he's talking to no one is excessively effective and cheeky) and he manages to (unlike Joe Pesci) act young. With exception of the bit where he crushes the man's hand where he walks and moves like a 70-year-old man.\n\nWhich brings us to the CGI, undeniably groundbreaking, and sometimes effective to a wonderful degree, and other times completely jarring and awkward and pulls you straight out of the movie. The eyes feel wrong, almost throughout, too blue, too CGI and sometimes too doe-eyed and glasssy, and sometimes the lips are terrible. And that magic of having DeNiro play a young Brando in The Godfather has been completely removed, now a young actor can't prove his grit when an old actor can be rendered younger, it's a real shame, especially when the old can act young, but the young *are* young. That's a different spirit. But when it works it's seamless and often I couldn't tell when they were aged up or down and by how much.\n\nOverall the film is quite good. That phone call scene is maybe the single best scene I've seen in a year, DeNiro is brilliant. The use of titles explaining the deaths of characters makes it more the special that in this film, Jimmy is still alive. It brings links between the Mafia and the Unions that I never knew, and the banality of some of these people and their lives mixed with the violence of their ends is effectively transmitted.\n\nAlso. Action Bronson is in it. The ending, regardless of the protracted runtime, is a riveting and subtle closing of the circle, the quietness of it struck me and stayed with me, an elegant master has created out of a handful of lines, how Jimmy sees himself and his end. To the Priest, and by proxy possibly to Saint Peter: \"Don't shut the door all the way\". Can an unrepentant man go to Heaven? Is Frank that man at all?",

Yes, the legendary director has had amazing films I've loved such as \"The Departed\", \"Wolf of Wall Street\", although I never thought I would see a film that took me back to the magic that is one of my favorite films of all time: \"Goodfellas\", his masterpiece in my opinion. Imagine \"Goodfellas\" but with a much older cast and mentality. Only Scorsese can direct a 3 hour and 30 minute movie and make it fly by so seamlessly. I was hooked from the beginning, and taken for a ride. No, it's not as high-octane of a ride as \"Goodfellas\" or \"Wolf of Wall Street\", and I'll do my best to lessen the comparisons to his other films, however this is a much more meditative approach to his style, themes of morality, death, and time passing by in the blink of an eye are recurring throughout. Each actor gives astounding performances, and what a legendary cast: Pacino, Pesci, De Niro, three presences I never thought to have seen on film at once. The gradual progression of the plot is also practically flawless, and the editing is simply phenomenal. Movies like this are scarce in the industry today, and only Martin can really craft these mob-epics to such a perfect degree. Regardless of it's lengthy run-time, it's a film I look forward to rewatching. Not as good as \"Goodfellas\", but this is certainly high-up in his filmography for me. If this were Scorsese's last film, it honestly would be a bang to go out with, and only strengthens the legendary director's legacy.\n9/10",

Movies like this have littered the film landscape for 38 years since 1972's The Godfather (which did the same thing but so much better, mainly because the genre was new). \nOn a broader brush I say: Scorsese and Tarantino and the ilk should no longer have the power to make their pointless glorification of murder stories. It is long past time to let new voices with new visions into the boys club of directing and producing movies. I am a movie lover fed up with decades of stories about murderers. Make it stop.

The CGI element is certainly interesting, although it still looks artificial, moreso in some scenes than others.

This film was directed by Martin Scorsese. The first concern of this film maybe that it's 3 and a half hours long. However, the direction and editing (by Thelma Schoonmaker), means that this film, which is dialogue heavy, feels like a 2 hour 45 minute film. Despite this, at some points within the dialogue heavy scenes it did feel to drag on, and about 15 to 20 minutes of the film could be cut to keep the pace up. Scorsese provides excellence once again within this movie, creating a 15 minute long sequence that keeps building up tension up to the climax of the sequence, one of the few film makers who can execute such a well crafted sequence. Written by Steven Zaillain, the screenplay for this film is excellent, the dialogue always felt like it was coming from the character and not a page, and the exclusion of Peggy Sheeran later in the film is a prime example of great show, don't tell storytelling. Edited by Thelma Schoonmaker and shot by Rodrigo Prieto, this film does an excellent job at always carrying a tension within a scene, with cuts never being too long or short. However,  at times within this film the continuity between shots didn't add up which momentarily took you out of the story. This film provided excellent all-round acting from the whole cast, especially from Robert De Niro (Frank Sheeran), Al Pacino (Jimmy Hoffa) and Joe Pesci (Russell Bufalino). This film is overall really well made with great direction, acting, editing and writing. Scorsese provides another incredible mob epic with a near unmatched ability to build tension within scenes.",

The Irishman is like dining at an an antiquated restaurant that hasn't changed its decor or menu in decades.  It's an old fashioned dish that is no longer savory.   Perhaps that is why at 220 minutes, \"The Irishman\" seems so 6 minutes ago.",

The de-aging didn't really work as well as they think it did. Yeah their faces looked younger, but they all still moved around like old men. I didn't buy certain choices that De Niro's character made. Of the three, Pacino's character was the most dynamic. He actually looked like he tried to act. De Niro and Peschi literally just showed up for a paycheck. I just don't get the love for this movie.

Based on the book \"I Heard You Paint Houses\" by Charles Brandt, adapted by Steven Zaillian, about a truck driver (Robert DeNiro) looking back on his time working as a hitman for a mobster (Joe Pesci), which leads to his employment as a bodyguard for Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino). In his seventies, Scorsese has made a drama about mortality and regret along with his usual themes of sin and redemption, but the youthful energy, black humor, and expressionism of his classics \"Mean Streets\" and GoodFellas\" are missing, so our interest fades. This elegy to the mafia has similarities to Bergman's \"Wild Strawberries.\" De Niro and Pacino give solid performances, but Pesci stands out. Known for his volatile, maniacal performances in previous Scorsese movies, Pesci shows a restraint here that is astonishing because he still maintains authority. A new technology used involving de aging effects is unconvincing. The actors are made to look younger facially, but the rest of their physical appearance has been unaltered. Another defect is the women in the movie are mostly nonexistent. Cinematography is by Rodrigo Prieto. Music is by Robbie Robertson. Editing is by Thelma Schoonmaker. With Harvey Keitel, Ray Romano, Bobby Canavale, Anna Paquin.",

With films like Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Shutter Island and Casino credited to his name, the expectations for The Irisman were very high, and Scorsese delivers in spectacular fashion. In a film concerning the massive personality of Jimmy Hoffa ( played beautifully by Al Pacino ), Robert DeNiro gives a wonderfully subdued performance as Frank Sheeran, Hoffa's bodyguard and closest friend. In the moments that Pacino is on screen, he controls the mood effortlessly going from calm, cool and collected to raging mad and then back down again. But perhaps the unsung star of this film is the masterful portrayal of Russell Buffalino by Joe Pesci. Pesci's cold blooded performance is, in my opinion, the best by an actor in a supporting roll in 2019 bar none. \n Not to be overlooked in this film is the beautiful cinematography, coupled with the groundbreaking de-aging software used to bring these characters to life. Something that was very refreshing to me was that this film allowed it's characters to just exist. Scorsese used the talent he knew these actors have to his full advantage. The dialogue in this film is near-perfect both from a writing perspective and from an acting perspective. Tension mounts in this film not by a sudden sound or some other common cheap trick used in many films today, but by a single phrase or facial expression which gives the viewer that sense of wondering just what is going to happen next. \n The Irishman is without question a major contender for the best picture award at the Academy Awards this year competing only, in my opinion, with Joker and Marriage Story. This film is a fresh reminder to Hollywood that it is okay to just let your script develope and breathe and to not congest a film with unnecessary CGI and explosions.",

One of the most under appreciated aspects of the picture was truthfully the score, which sounded dark and industrial when it needed to be. De Niro, Pacino, and Pesci lead the film perfectly, although acts such as Sebastien Maniscalco, Bobby Cannavale, and of course Harvey Kietel, add to the film tremendously.

For supporting actors however, Joe Pesci is precise and measured and the chemistry between him and Bob is faultless portraying the long-lasting friendship perfectly. The CGI technology is also helpful, transforming De Niro into his younger self, but this film has a deep meaning, about age, morals (or the lack of them) and loosing your humanity.

            "content": "At this stage in his career, Martin Scorsese could make any film he wanted and, regardless of quality, it would be heaped with praise and called a masterpiece. The Irishman is a prime example of that. It feels likes the Director's swansong, a movie that crams in everything he's become known for over the decades, casts some of his favourite actors, and voila, cinematic magic. At 3 and a half hours long, the movie is unforgivably overextended. Like Wolf Of Wall Street, the first hour was enjoyable, but things drag more and more the longer it goes on. So many things feel manufactured to amp up the runtime. Establishing shots take too long, conversations are rambling, some scenes are pointless, there's way too many characters and all the major ones get a narrated introduction. If its intention was to make us sympathise with Jiffy Hoffa then it fails, since Pacino is essentially recycling his \u2018Guy who argues at length with everybody' schtick, and it gets so annoying that you actively want him to die. The acting is good, as you'd imagine from the cast it has, but nobody is doing anything especially noteworthy. DeNiro is doing his \u2018DeNiro in a mobster movie' performance, which he's done plenty of times before, and Harvey Keitel has so little screen time that I don't know what we would lose if his character was completely cut. Anna Paquin, an Oscar winner let's not forget, has about 4 lines of dialogue, and spends most of the film staring in disbelief, something that I'm pretty sure any actress could have pulled off. At the end of the day, The Irishman will be praised as a modern classic, but when stacked up with movies like Goodfellas, Raging Bull & Taxi Driver, it will not be recognised as one of Scorsese's finest, only the longest.",

To get De Niro, Pacino together again is an utter joy. Adding in Joe Pesci is a cherry on top. This fantastic movie from director Martin Scorsese sees the trio return to themes that have featured large in all of their careers telling as it does a story of Mafia, mobsters and hitmen spanning a period of many decades. The Irishman of the title is a young truck driver, Frank Sheeran (De Niro), who earns a bit on the side by cutting deals and swindling his employer while delivering meat. Through his wheeler-dealing he crosses paths with Russ Bufalino (Pesci) who heads a family with deep connections to the mob. Sheeran begins to work for Bufalino and starts to gain a reputation as a trustworthy strong arm guy and hitman. This in turn leads him to develop links with union boss Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino).\nThe story weaves a slow and complicated path where the friendship, rivalry and power play between the three is superbly observed. Each has a very different character with Hoffa mercurial and obsessive, Sheeran quiet, loyal and ruthless and Bufalino calculating and diplomatic. The whole movie is a fascinating character study and the interplay between the three leads is electrifying. These are truly actors at the top of their game.\nThe technical innovation f this movie is the way in which all three actors are made to appear younger by several decades from their actual age. I the past, this would have been achieved by employing different actors to play the men at different ages or by employing younger actors and ageing them with make-up. Here, Scorsese in his own words uses digital technology \"As make-up\" and it really does work. At first, I wasn't too sure as De Niro's face is so well known these days from his older roles and it is a real shock to see him unexpectedly young. However, the initial uncertainty is soon forgotten and the fact that all three age progressively as we pass through the years seems natural and very effective. \nIt is a long movie at over three hours but, unlike many films that have similar runtimes, there is not a minute that feels like padding and I was totally absorbed by the on-screen action. What Scorsese does so well here is tell a story of relationship. It is about family and friendship, betrayal and tragedy. Beautifully shot, wonderfully acted and expertly paced this is a truly brilliant picture.",

The acting overall is great, but the performances by DeNiro, Pesci, and Pacino are brilliant \u2013 the choice to cast these three, veterans from previous mob films and Scorcese films was excellent. They all do a great job of playing younger and older versions of themselves. DeNiro and Pesci are especially great \u2013 both disappear into their roles and give their characters deep believability. Even though I think some parts of the story were created for dramatic effect, the overall story, at its 3.5-hour length (I had to watch it in two sittings), is well shot and scripted for a very compelling story; I could not figure out what I would cut if I could. The capturing of the period through the music and cinematography are also excellent, even down to the wives who were constantly demanding their husbands take cigarette breaks while on their drive to Detroit \u2013 those hairdos and Virginia Slims!

            "content": "Martin Scorsese is a director considered by many to be the best in history, whether for bringing us movies like \"Goodfellas,\" \"Taxi Driver,\" or how he directs and the way he makes use of music, so When they announced that they would release a new movie, many people got excited because Martin Scorsese does not disappoint and this is no exception, this time he brings us with Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci, actors who had lowered their reputation, a movie 3 h 30 minutes, about Frank Sheeran a former war veteran who ends up getting involved in organized crime becoming his hitman, this is a movie that really is not for everyone because of its long duration, if you are willing to see it you have to prepare , otherwise it won't be possible for you to enjoy it.\n\u00a0One of the biggest mistakes of the movie in my opinion are those of rejuvenating the actors, let's be honest Joe Pesci looks like plastic and De Niro is just the same as with the most blue eyes and black hair, I take this as a mistake because they could do much better, I say even a user on YouTube managed to do better.\nAlso to tell the truth the movie is unnecessarily long, it is because the story that it has to tell is a story that frankly can be told in less time, but hey my opinion, maybe for someone the movie feels short and in fact should last longer.\nObviously the successes of the film are bigger, the interpretation of Joe Pesci seemed very good, it is different because it is known for playing aggressive characters, in \"Goodfellas\" I play a violent Gangster who was carried away by emotions and In Home Alone I play a violent man who liked to harass minors.\nThe same can be said of Alpacino and De Niro, great performances, as for the story one would think that it is the typical story of a man who is ascending in the world of the mafia and then falls, narrated intelligently using three timelines each with its purpose, what differentiates this from other gangster and gangster movies is that it focuses more on issues such as friendship or oblivion, therefore it ends up being an interesting and engaging story, and as I said Scorsese manages to execute it very Well, I found the soundtrack great, the uses of music and all that, I liked the environment because it has that touch of \"Goodfellas\", several scenes are very similar.\nAnd that is all I have to say about \"The Irishman\", so in conclusion \"The Irishman is a 3-and-a-half hour movie, which could last less, with good special effects except on the part of rejuvenating Joe Pesci already De Niro, but with great performances, a good direction, a striking environment, a great soundtrack, and a well-adapted script.",

Nothing about this movie is creative: acting, camera work and direction are all mediocre, and the technology used to make the also great DeNiro and Pesci look 40 years younger is ridiculous, particularly on the bodies of bent-over 70-somethings. The bottom line for many viewers is that the film is boring and repetitive. Anyone who claims that this film is \"meditative\" or \"about friendship\" must be blinded by the bright, bright shine of the Emperor's clothes, just in time for Scorsese to receive all the accolades that he should have for other films in the past.",

This movie is a three and a half hour long epic and while it doesn't necessary fly by, you enjoy every minute.\nThe film follows Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro), a truck driver who becomes a hitman involved with mobster Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci) and his crime family, including his time working for the powerful Teamster Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino).\nThe powerhouse of actors in this movie is what sold me on it, aside form it being a Martin Scorsese film. I'm not going to talk a lot about the acting in this movie, we all know who these people are and wat they are capable of and with an amazing director behind them, no wrong can be done. I do want to discuss one actor that when a lot of people think of him, they think of Home Alone, and that's Joe Pesci. He was amazing in this movie. He stole every scene he was in for me and I was in awe watching his performance. \nIt's not a flawless movie and I wouldn't necessarily call it a masterpiece or something new and innovative. But for an old genre gangster film it's easily one of the best ones out there on recent years. It does have a long runtime and it is an investment, but the story being told is very good.\nOverall, the movie has great performances with a very good story. The runtime is long, but if you can be invested in the story that's being told it won't matter. I really enjoyed thee film and think people who liked film such as \u2018Casino' or \u2018Goodfellas' will enjoy this movie too.\n4.5/5",

            "content": "Oof. I must admit, watching this entire film was quite an endeavor. At 3.5 hours, it plays more like a miniseries than a single cohesive film, and I admit I cheated and took a break halfway through. Not that this length is unusual for a Martin Scorcese film; if you take a look at his filmography, pretty much all of his films run at least 2.5 hours, most of them closer to 3. Unfortunately, this one doesn't fill up the time with the dynamism and rapid pacing that is typical of Scorcese's work, and you really feel its length. Robert De Niro plays the titular Irishman, a hitman (or \"house painter\", as the movie calls him) for the mob and eventually for the Teamsters. The film is essentially his autobiography (though I would caution the viewer not to take it literally; the character is a real guy and the film is based on his self-report, but pretty much all of his claims have been debunked\u2026 this film is a work of fiction), and the timeline bounces around throughout his lifetime and experiences, though the exact years are never specified. It creates a confusing narrative that's able to be followed only by tracking the age of the characters (the story is told over the course of several decades and the actors are both \u2018youth-anized' via CGI and aged via makeup at different points). As you would expect from a veteran cast like this (De Niro! Pesci! Keitel! Pacino!), the performances are outstanding; I particularly enjoyed Pesci's performance. However, Pacino is miscast as Hoffa. It's not that he's bad in the film; on the contrary, his performance is one of the best I've seen from him in years. It's just that he is always so PACINO\u2026 his performances are so affected, he is not the kind of actor who can disappear into a role. There are high points and low points over the course of the film, but the movie is best in the beginning; it's here where it feels more like Scorcese film, with his signature voiceover, quick cuts, and dynamic camerawork. It slows down and loses all its energy once Hoffa is introduced (about an hour in!) and the movie becomes more of a political/courtroom drama. This is the largest section of the movie and it can be dull. When you think of Scorcese's best work (Goodfellas, Casino, even Wolf of Wall Street), they are lengthy movies, but they are fully engrossing. What made them so effective is that they were personal stories, revolving around a central character that included both the professional and personal life. This film follows that same formula, but in 3.5 hours, they barely touch on the Irishman's private life - it's all business. There is no Lorraine Bracco or Sharon Stone character to anchor the film in humanity or give it drama. As such, there is something a little lackluster about this film. It's too much head and not enough heart. It's not really a surprise that this movie had such trouble getting a studio to fund it - if he wasn't Martin Scorcese, it would never had had a shot. The story is too sprawling with too many characters, and it's too long by half. It's absolutely a self-indulgent film, but hey, whaddyagonnado, it's Scorcese - at this point, he can do what he wants. He's one of the best directors of all time and his films are always quality, and this one is no exception. But this is not his best work, and one that could have been helped by a little studio interference. Not all movies should be released as a director's cut.",

With its CGI de-aging of a decidedly septuagenarian cast, it looks like the Grand Theft Auto version of Goodfellas\u2014of some interest as a technical exercise, but far from the explosive tour de force for which one would have hoped. Unfortunately, the de-aged Robert De Niro, and co-stars, look nothing like they did at any point in the past\u2014and they forgot to de-age their physiques, or movements. In a scene in which he beats a victim on the sidewalk, De Niro appears every one of his 76 years, and is laughably unconvincing. I can't imagine Stella Adler would have been impressed.\n\nLacking the stunning visual flair and narrative urgency of Goodfellas, or fascinating use of language of Casino\u2014which would have required a Nicholas Pileggi script\u2014The Irishman sags under the weight of its own vanity. Everything on show here has been displayed many times before\u2014usually on The Sopranos\u2014and Scorsese falls back on referencing his own back catalogue, including matching shots from Taxi Driver that were striking in their originality \u2026in 1976. While De Niro and Al Pacino phone in their performances, Joe Pesci wisely elects to play against type as a reserved, unshowy boss, and Harvey Keitel and Ray Romano punch occasional holes in the drab tableaux. Scorsese would have been better off casting actors 30 or 40 years younger, and leaving these shadows of their 1970s heyday to play the aging greaseballs directing things from backrooms. This is not a veiled comedy of manners like Raging Bull or Goodfellas\u2014and, as the central characters give us nothing to empathize with, we care nothing about their fates.\n\nIf one wishes to reflect on what acting talent can do, it is worth recalling that, when Marlon Brando played Vito Corleone in The Godfather, he was 46\u2014but surely no one in his right mind would wish to see him play 30+ years younger than himself. I imagine that in the near future technology will advance to a point where entire performances will be interpolated from ones previously committed to celluloid\u2014and then I'm going to stop going to the movies altogether.",

The best editing (Thelma Schoonmaker) of the year makes the runtime smoother, but it still drags on for too long. I also feel that Anna Paquin's character should have had more impact. The de-aging VFX is mind-blowing, even if it takes a few minutes to get used to it.\"",

            "content": "I've seen a number of truly great movies this year- and this one was (probably) the greatest. I thoroughly enjoyed films liked Marriage Story, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, Avengers: Endgame, Joker and Parasite and found by them all to be fantastic in their own right- but the Irishman was my personal favourite. \n\nI am a massive fan of Martin Scorsese, and found this to be quite summative of his career and cinematic abilities. His direction is truly as ambitious as ever, and he succeeds marvellously in this film (in my opinion of course). Scorsese's daring direction effectively benefits the scope of the film- providing both grandiloquent moments (specifically throughout Hoffa's speeches) and needed intimacy (Sheeran's moments in the third act of the film are particularly personal). Scorsese wisely chooses not to create a film identical to Goodfellss or Casino- however cleverly utilises similarities in plot devices and shot types. The film is nonetheless different to anything he has done before- combining his spiritual and emotional styles with the general style of most of his mob films. Scorsese's creative, ambitious and powerful direction is one of his greatest.\n\n Thelma Schoonmaker's editing is particularly excellent- with only two particular mistakes, however none are deal-breakers and this is quite possibly the best editing of the year.\n\nRodrigo Pietro's cinematography is typically brilliant and is largely beneficial to the film's atmosphere. \n\nAh and yes the performances, of all the large ensemble film shows of the year (Bombshell, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, Marriage Story, Avengers: Endgame, Little Women, etc) this one has ultimately the greatest- only slightly. The film's three leads (Pesci, De Niro, Pacino) are astounding- each acting greater then they ever have since the early-mid 90s. The supporting cast is also particularly fantastic- everyone is convincing, and some are even underused.\n\nDe Niro's acting in this film has been particularly overlooked this awards season- this is his greatest acting since Goodfellas. His subtlety is captivating and often devestating- creating a character that is both one to sympathise with and simultaneously be frustrated with. He shines in the thirst act of the film, and in a particular call scene, in which he devestates as a lonely man who took for granted his family and his friends due to his loyalty- and yet you find never truly understanding him, which only amounts to the devestation. It's a complicated, subtle and beautiful performance- and one I hope is not overlooked.\n\nPacino has never been better- his bombastic and aggressive acting has never been better suited to a film- and he shines greatly. He is truly hilarious, terrifying and captivating as Hoffa- capturing his essence excellently. He too is subtle in intimate moments, and it is absolutely one of his greatest performances. You love his character so much, you become increasingly frusturated when he refuses to accept that \"it is what it is\". It is an incredible performance. \n\nPesci is of course brilliant and is as subtle as De Niro- but far more frightening. His Russel Buffalino is one of his greatest performances- he goes against type in his subtlety, yet keeps the terror associated with his prior performances as mobsters. He rarely ever showcases his anger, and manipulates the world around him cleverly and often politely. Like De Niro, he often is devestating- particularly in the prison scenes. It is debateably his greatest performance. \n\nActors from the supporting cast are also quite excellent- Stephen Graham's Tony Pro is fantastically aggressive and fearsome, he bounces off Pacino very, very well. Harvey Keitel's Angelo Bruno is enigmatic and terrifying, and was underused- but understandably so. Anna Paquin utilises the few lines she has well and her distance from her father is particularly significant to the story and quite devestating. Ray Romano's Bill Buffalino is quite funny and enjoyable- and Bobby Cannanvale is equally effective and sometimes even terrifying.  \n\nThe CGI isn't perfect, but it does not effect the excellence of this film, and if anything contributes to the idea of an aged Sheeran retelling a story from his perception in a reflective sense. \n\nIt is quite possibly Scorsese's 21st Century Magnum Opus, and is an incredible and ambitious film. It is in my opinion, one of Scorsese's Top 5 films- and one that feels his most personal, emotional and haunting. It's final shot is possibly one of Scorsese's greatest, and one that will remain in my mind forever- capturing just how much someone can lose, and how depressing the human condition is.",

While I think \"The Irishman\" is not a perfect movie, there is enough in it for me to think it is one of Academy Award winning director Martin Scorsese's finest works.  What makes it work the most for me is its top notch cast mostly made of of veterans of Scorsese's past works.  Robert DeNiro is, once again, in top form as title character Frank Sheeran.  He is very believable in the role.  The same can be said for Al Pacino who gives an equally as impressive performance as Jimmy Hoffa.  Though he is best known as a comedic actor Ray Romano shines as lawyer Bill Bufalino.  Look fast for comedian Jim Norton as the late Don Rickles.  The only criticism I have of the movie is not its length, but a few formulaic moments.  However this is just a small criticism of what is overall a terrific film that is well worth seeing.",

            "content": "THE IRISHMAN \n\nThe Irishman is about the relationship among three main characters: Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), Frank Sheeran (Robert DeNiro) and Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci).  Hoffa was head of the Teamsters Union in the 1950s and early 60s, but it's his connection to the Kennedys that is at the core of this movie. \n\nIn 1961, with the help of his father's mob connections, John Kennedy was elected President. He appointed his brother, Robert, as Attorney General. Robert Kennedy made the arrest and conviction of Hoffa a top priority. Hoffa was jailed for trying to bribe a juror and fraud, then pardoned by Richard Nixon in 1971 (he gave Nixon a large contribution). By that time, he had lost control of the Teamsters and was banned from holding office in a union, but he refused to retire and was fighting to get back 'his union' when he disappeared on July 30, 1975, never to be heard from again.\n\nThe Irishman is Martin Scorsese's fourth movie about the mob or gangsters (I don't count The Gangs of New York as a mob movie) among over fifty non-gangster movies, but this is what he is known for. It runs for three and a half hours - or I should say, strolls, leisurely cutting back and forth in time from the early 1950s to the turn of the century. Veteren screenwriter Steven Zaillian wrote the script from Charles Brandt's book, \"I Heard You Paint Houses, \" the title of the book being mob-talk for a hit man.\n\nMartin Scorsese loves voice over narration and most of his mob movies have voice-over narration as does this one by Sheeran. He starts out as a truck driver who helps things fall off the back of the truck - in his case, sides of beef - and ends up a mob hitman. Along the way, he marries, divorces and has four daughters, one of whom refuses to have anything to do with him when she gets old enough to understand what he was - a murderer.\n\nThe Irishman is not primarily the story of Jimmy Hoffa which has been told in a major film before, Danny DeVito's Hoffa (1992) from a script by David Mamet and starring Jack Nicholson in the title role. Hoffa was neither a critical nor commercial success. \n\nIn The Irishman, Scorsese has bigger fish to fry than the story of Hoffa - he wants to connect the election of John F. Kennedy, the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the CIA's undercover operations to kill Castro, the assassination of Kennedy and the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa. \n\nHe doesn't quite make it, but that doesn't stop him from trying very hard - like the fact that Sheeran in 1961 is ordered by Bufalino to take a truck to Miami that is loaded with military weapons and deliver it to 'a guy with big ears.' When Sheeran gets there and talks to the 'guy with big ears' we see that the guy doesn't have big ears because, as the big-eared guy explains, he had an operation to fix them.  The weapons are loaded into a van with Spanish writing on its side - apparently these are weapons that were used in the Bay of Pigs fiasco. All of this is done so that thirteen years later, when Sheeran is watching the Watergate hearings on TV and sees 'big ears'  testifying, it can be revealed that he is Howard Hunt, a Watergate conspirator. So instead of just telling Sheeran to deliver the weapons to Howard Hunt we have a lot of time wasted on hiding who that person is just so we can be 'surprised' that it is Howard Hunt of Watergate fame. \n\nThere are very long scenes about ...nothing much. For example, the core of the movie is a long car trip that Sheeran takes with Bufalino and their wives. There is a lot of talk about taking 'cigarette breaks' and the fact that Bufalino makes many stops along the way to collect money from various people.  All of this has nothing to do with anything.\n\nScorsese's use of the same actors playing their characters' decades-long relationships is made possible by using CGI to change the actors aging face. I don't know if it was a conscious decision, but all the actors look like they are wearing masks. And the fact that peoples' faces change, not just wrinkles, over time is a real hindrance to this technique. I was never distracted by it but I did wonder, at times, where we were in the story - is this older Sheeran or younger?\n\nDeNiro and Pesci have the same great chemistry that has made them a delight to watch since Raging Bull. Pacino enters the movie about a third of the way through and gives it a boost. Ray Romano gives a solid performance as Bufalino's lawyer brother and Bobby Cannavale does his crazy mobster bit as Skinny Razor. But the best performance in the movie belongs to Stephen Graham (Capone in Boardwalk Empire) as Anthony 'Tony Pro' Provenzano, a rival of Hoffa's.\n\nIs it worth watching? Of course - but don't get your hopes up. This isn't the crowning gem of anybody's career. It a long, too long, poorly told story of some very bad people who did some very bad things - things that Scorsese seems reluctant to touch. For example, Hoffa helped destroy not only the reputation of the Teamsters Union, but unions in general. Movies about union bosses rarely show them for what the vast majority were and are - leaders working to make life better for the working people of America. Instead, Scorsese's union bosses are all corrupt - or fools.\n\nA final note - a lot of the action takes place in South Philadelphia where I grew up. There is not even a slight attempt to make it realistic and there are no South Philly accents in the movie. But there is Angelo Bruno (Harvey Keitel). I never figured out why he was in the movie. Local color I guess.\n\nA final final note - a lot of the mobsters on display are introduced by a blurb on screen telling us what happened to the mobster e.g. for Bruno: shot in the head sitting in a car outside his home. I am not sure why this was done. Crime doesn't pay? Not quite Michael Corleone sitting and staring out into space, wondering when and where and how it all went to hell.",

But I tell you: Watch this movie, you will never see such movie again. I will start with the cast: Robert De Niro, normaly he`s the minded organisator. In Casino he has been the talented jew which no one really liked, a uncompromising buisnessman. Not a real part of the mafia and not really sympathic. In Goodfellas he has also been the irishman, not really quiet not really psychopatic. A little bit of both. Now he plays a man which one rises in the cosa nostra, a brutal murderer and a cold man. Just right after the moment he found buffalino the mob exchanged his family. You can feel the distance between Frank Sheeran and his daughter Peggy. De Niro shows that he is so far better than Dirty Grandpa or The Intern. He gives a quiet and silent performance which report illustrates how cold blooded his character is willing to be. Then the great Al Pacino, who gives his best performance since maybe 20 years. He portraied Jimmy Hoffa and he plays it with pure aggression and the wild temprament of the  former union. He shines in the glory and power that Hoffa had. But its getting even better when the big hoffa, the maybe second mightiest man in the USA becomes somthing like a mob beggar. Maybe one of pacinos best roles since a very very long time. It`s a suprise that joe pesci is the quitest under this, to be honest, Mafioso's already very sober circle. He shows that he is more than home alone or an aggressiv mobster which dies in a brutal way. He`s the quiet don. But in the first scenes with him we can see how an actor is able to focus the pure might micostructure on himself. He is the smallest amongst but we never have the feel that he is the smallest. So much about the cast. The Movie scirpt might be to long, but this scirpt shows us far more how the characters fall down, how the wohle mob falls down. We can notice how the mob parasite treason and fbi infect the buffalino mafia clan and the whole crime scene. Scorsese highlights this with informing us how our characters will go down. With a nearly pefect artwork of the 50s and 70s Philadelphia and impressive violence shots. But you don`t watch this movie because you want to see violence. We dont feel good and amused like we do during goodfellas. After the last shot, I felt more sad. In the end its a swansong from Martin Scorsese on his own movies. We nearly feel sometimes crying, espacially during the heartbreaking phone call scene. And this is what the irishman makes so much better than a Scorsese Best of Movie or something else. It highlights the end. The end of an era. The Irishman stands for itself. It shows me why I love movie and why I was fasicanted me in crime and corruption and might. Thank you Martin Scorsese",

Well they're wrong.  It's nostalgic and it's does absolutely nothing wrong, but if you're grading this against other Scorsese films it's middle of the pack at best.  When we watched this on date afternoon/date night we were engaged and interested but not blown away.

The vague back and forth of \"he gotta go\"s and similar mafia talk is excessive and boring, although it's essential to the point the story is telling. Buckle up and power through it, the flood is coming.\n\nOnly reason I deducted half a star from a perfect score is the mediocre (at best) CGI. Young Frank and whatever they were doing with his eyes is distracting throughout the whole movie. Can't watch it when my mind is shouting \"WHY RUIN THIS AWESOME SCENE WITH BAD CGI, WHYYYYY\".

I don't know how young the De Niro character was supposed to have been at his youngest, but he moved and walked like a 75-year-old who never regarded staying fit as a priority.\n\nMy wife and I felt exactly the same about this film: a bunch of septuagenarians who got together and decided to have fun telling a potentially interesting story, without changing anything that they have been doing for more than 30 years. The problem is that this doesn't work anymore, especially when all of the elements (the script, the acting and the direction) look like they had been gathering dust for decades and excelled in a tremendous lack of energy and vitality.\n\nI do hope that Scorsese, who is a filming genius, can rediscover himself for his next film.",

Also when Anna Paquin (whose roll neither connected us emotionally to De Niro or to Pacino tho I believe that was the entire purpose) was supposed to be a Teenager in one of her many zero line scenes toward the middle of the film she was so clearly a nearly 40 year old woman. I just feel as though these roles were  pure vanity and should have been cast using younger actors. The plot was fine, several points in the storyline I found myself wishing for just about any emotional stakes, even when the wife dies it felt only as if De Niro was \"A\"cting like he cared. The world building and Pesci were the only things that made this picture watchable.\nEven great directors have projects that get out of the bag, vanity projects for aging actors/producers tend to lean that way in my opinion.",

The de-aging is subtle, and effective....it never draws attention to itself (though I still think Captain Marvel did it better). Pesci, De Niro, and Pacino are all great (with my favorite being Pacino), though I don't think any of the performances are Oscar caliber.  I loved the opening shot inside a nursing home.  The costume design and production design are fantastic (film might win for production design). Scorcese is a great director, but he's certainly done far better films than this (and there are better gang/mob/mafia films than this). Irishman is undeniably a well-made, well directed and well acted film, but personally I wouldn't put it on the best films of 2019 list. Then again, there aren't many gangster/mob/mafia films that I love, so it likely just wasn't made for me. Those that enjoy this kind of thing though will find lots to love here.",

Early on it immediately appeared to be a remake of \"Hoffa\" done in '92 with the early scene of a truck driver dealing with a broken down truck and getting assistance from someone in a suit. The difference is that when \"Hoffa\" was filmed Jack Nicholson was turning 55 and Danny DeVito was 48, in the Irishman both Di Niro and Pesci are 76 and Pacino is 82 and no CGI remastering off wrinkles or any sort of makeup jobs made them look younger to reenact the early years of the story. Unfortunately, their expiration dates have come and gone as they moved stiffly revealing their true age. Martin Scorsese as well just took us over familiar ground that made use of Di Niro recounting the tale just like Ray Liotta  recounted \"Good Fellas\", there was nothing original apart from viewer being advised as to when a few of them were whacked, in what manner and in what year. To be honest, I did not set myself up with any high expectations apart from finding myself having to sign up again with Netflix to catch this. The only sub plot that seemed somewhat interesting was Frank Sheeran's daughter Peggy who turned out to be a pretty adult woman, and even that went nowhere apart from the initial overall creepiness of Russell Bufalino offering her candy as a little girl. Lastly, it is just way to long to keep anyone captivated... at 2 hours into it early on a Saturday night I had to take a break from it as it just was going slow to nowhere... I finished it off the next day and thought really. Some say one needs to let this film breath like a fine red wine, give me a break at times it was like watching paint dry... Talking of which for any memorable lines, there wasn't any... unless one thinks \"I heard you paint houses\" is memorable...",

Overall impression at the end was improved; the original soundtrack is very sad and melancholic, and the end of the movie was felt like it was a conclusive act to the whole 'gangster' career of Scorsese and the company; but still, enough is enough, we all have seen this.",

Another great gangsta film from Scorsese and this shows them from a young age to them at the end of their life. It also has great new deaging technology to show the three main actors ( Robert Deniro, Al Pachino and Joe Pesci) at a young to an older age however in one scene it kind of does look like a video game cutscene on Deniro's face but it does not make the film any worse. In the film the analogy of comparing the army to the mafia was very interesting but it was subtle and many might not see it but I did and I loved it.   The best acting in this film is in my opinion is from Joe Pesci and I think he should have an Oscar for best supporting actor. I have said it before but seeing the gangstas as old men in many physically, mentally and emotionally, it is done very well showing how these murders would look back on their life, their mistakes and their regrets. The final few scenes of this film with an older Frank Sheeran coming to end of his life trying to prepare for death and fix his mistakes, all these scenes are very emotional and learning that before death you can not fix all your mistakes. It is sad seeing that in his life  he saw how the world changed around him and when he is at a retiring home that no one knew who his best friend Jimmy Hoffa was. Overall, this is a perfect depiction of a life full of secrets and regrets and the acting and directing is phenomenal, this is a perfect film.",

That said, \u2018The Irishman' was absolutely abysmal and a true chore to sit through. Its plodding and slow paced, and the de-aging CGI is jarring. The plot was so convoluted, I was only able to understand what was happening because I had previously read a biography on Jimmy Hoffa. If I didn't have that historical context, I don't think the film would have made any sense at all. Somehow, every single character in the story was deplorable and I couldn't have cared less if anyone lived or died. Unlike a show like \u2018The Sopranos' where the main character is a sort of anti-hero you can root for, I couldn't feel the slightest bit of empathy for anyone. Frank, Russ, Jimmy, even Frank's daughter Peggy planned by Anna Paquin was annoying and she only has a single line of dialog! Major disappointment. I'll give it 1 star for successfully having moving images on a screen, but that's it.",

This is largely attributed to the digital effects used on his face, and his rather unlikable character, but I don't think it's outrageous to expect the highest standard from DeNiro.

It certainly has its outstanding attributes, but it also feels as though there's a lot of extra weight added that isn't essential, which pushes out the film's length to minutes that perhaps don't need to be there.

Robert DeNiro Is my favorite actor of all time, by far (excluding The Spice Channel, of course)\n\n2. Martin Scorsese is one of my two or three favorite directors of all time.\n\n3. I LOVE gangster films. Godfather I, Godfather II Casino and Goodfellas are all in my top ten. Hell, Godfather III is even top twenty.\n\nThat said, The Irishman was absolutely horrible!  All of the Millennial \"social media buzz\" over this film is pure bullshit.\n\nThis movie sucked.\n\nI've had to give it a lot of thought to come up with what sucked the most. There was much suckage to choose from, but far and away the It Sucked Most Award has to go to Al Pacino for his absolutely terrible portrayal of Jimmy Hoffa.\n\nI thought Al would never be able to top his absolutely horrible Cuban accent in Scarface, but he's done it here with his on-again, off-again half-hearted attempt to imitate Hoffa's flat, nasal Detroit inflection.\n\nEven DeNiro sucked, falling back on every DeNiro trope in his bag.\n\nAnd Scorsese! People have gone on and on raving over the length of this film and it's pace. Kinda reminds me of this old guy who used to play in the poker room I work in who took FOREVER to do anything. He gets to showdown with this young guy one day. The young guy shows his hand and thinks he's won the pot. The old guy stares at the board, looks back at his hand, stares at the board again. The young guy says \"What'cha got?\" The old guy stares at the board for another minute, then turns over his hand. He's got the nuts. The young guy is PISSED!\"\n\n\"He didn't slow-roll you, Son\" I said, \"That's just as fast as he can go!\"\n\nGot a big laugh, even from the pissed-off young guy, but it was actually true.\n\nIt's sad, but the same is true for everyone in this film. Imagine if Michael Jordan had tried a third comeback .... this would be his fourth.\n\nAnd the reverse aging! Good God! The first time they flashed back to that scene of DeNiro driving that truck in the 50s I literally gasped. How could anyone not have looked at that and said: \"This thing needs more work\"?\n\nThe only high point for me was Joe Pesci's performance. I'm not normally a big fan of his work, he's essentially delivered the same over-the-top portrayal of a homicidal maniac in every film he's been in.\n\nHere his work was subtle and nuanced. I'm just not sure if that was by choice, or whether he he was just missing nap-time.\n\nUgggghhhh",

From, Steven Zaillian, who gave us the inside scoop on baseball in Moneyball, comes the insider's scoop on Hoffa, the mob and the common men that made it all possible. There is a true human quality to the lanscape furnished by Zaillian's words, and with the lived in performances from the cast, and the special zing of Schoonmaker's edit, there's a real pulse to the piece.\n\nThe acting: everyone shines. Deniro is at his most specific in decades; Pacino brings gusto and a surprising amount of humor; Pesci is charming and moves with the ease of a true Don; and the supporting cast with their fitting faces and voices, or those more notable names who took the chance to play a character role with aplomb, seamlessly deliver.\n \nThe editing: the film takes its time until the midpoint or so and then the adrenaline ride surges and soars to the finish. Scorcese films are master classes in editing, and here the unique contribution is the reliance on dialogue and scene work. As a sort of meditation on aging and death, it seems fitting he gives his ensemble of older men the chance to carry the film with their performances. There is of course the occasional montage, the big oners and rhythmically cut set pieces, but the the film derives its strength from the internal power of its prime movers, the lead actors.\n\nThe film: is beautiful, simple, dynamic, dark. A great and grounded piece of cinema.",

Almost all actors are far too old for their roles, and I am not sure they known what they are doing, wandering around a much too long tedious story. Scorsese, I hope it was fun meeting up with your old pals once more, but why bother us with it? Robert, it's time to pack it in and room for newcomers. You can breastfeed a baby in your next movies, as far as I am concerned. Waste of good film, and it makes me wonder, how bad does a movie have to be to get negative reviews? These days I see crappy movies scoring through the roof with both \"experts\" and viewers alike. Something is really wrong here because by scoring bad movies high, you are lowering the quality for all of us. Scorsese is thinking, if the still love this maybe I can try a bit less next time. Just put in some aged favourite actors and you cannot go wrong!",

I would, however, be lying if I said I wasn't a bit let down by the certain elements in play here. Perhaps, it's the media-fuelled hype train powering this movie into the heights of my \"most anticipated for the rest of the year\" list, but a lot of the fuss made over the length, tech and certain cast members in this movie just didn't come across the way I worry they were supposed to. Was the de-aging impressive? I mean. Not really? It's nowhere near the level of distractingly bad that some have been saying it is, but, again, the impression it made in any direction was slight. Was the three-and-a-half hour runtime justified in the end? Startlingly, no. There are numerous moments, bits of dialogue, and even scenes that either repeat ideas we're already well-acquainted with or add nothing to the overall product as a whole. \n\nSo why did I like this movie so much? Enter the final act, which tries (and mostly succeeds in) contextualizing the whole of what you've just watched, ultimately shaping the movie at large into one of the more mournful dirges on lost life, time and innocence that I've seen in quite some time. It really gave me pause to see Scorsese and Co. wax so pensively on the subject matter and characters at hand. It approached a plane of near-meta proportions and I was deeply taken by it all. I just wish we got there a tad quicker.\n\nAll in all, this is (I assume) a fitting end to Scorsese's reign as gangster movie maestro in chief. Sure, I've seen him do more with less in the subgenre, but it was nice to see the big man step up to the plate one last time.",

First of all the casting, \"The Irishman\" starring Robert De Niro....is there no Irish actors that could pull off this role? I would have enjoyed seeing some fresh faces that could better portray the characters throughout there lives without the need of face enhancement technology. Which begs the question, should \"The Irishman\" be included in the animated feature segment at the Oscars? While this facial technology is undoubtedly better the John Goodman in the \"Righteous Gemstones\" it still didn't work for me. Too many De Niro classic faces while he is younger (you know the face.) After rewatching \"Raging Bull\" really this doesnt really look like young De Niro. At one point in the film De Niro is beating up somebody on the street and it looks like a 70-year-old man with a 35-year-old face barely able to move. The story is great, and a fascinating subject in Jimmy Hoffa. Laying out new details that seem like they could be true in regards to his dissapernace. It makes you feel like you are viewing another lense into the \"Goodfellas\" universe but ultimately doesn't live up to the hype for me. Good for one Saturday morning watch.",

For all the CGI, he just can't seem like a young man who can \u2018handle himself' and makes for a sad spectacle to watch. In speech, both Pacino and De Niro fall back on a parody of the Scorsese-vernacular and fail miserably at playing the Irishman Sheeran and the German-Dutch Hoffa. There exist film recordings of both and the way they speak and neither of them speaks like a supporting character on Goodfellas.\n\nThe film's pace is not deliberate but indulgent. It starts with showing a man wake up, get out of bed, and dress; a beginner may start a film like that. There's an entire sequence when De Niro\u2018s character exits a car, walks over to a plane, enters the plane, the plane fies, De Niro exits the plane, walks over to a car, opens the door, gets in, finds keys and drives off, grimacing all the time  There are less clumsy ways to show moral trepidation in film.\n\nThe tragedy of greats as they get older is that they are surrounded with sycophants who will not tell them when they are making beginners' mistakes. Scorsese is at a point in his career when he doesn't really need to make films, and he should perhaps stop. \n\nHalf a star for the excellent performance of Pesci who steals every scene he's in.",

As for the length, it didn't bother me.  Being on Netflix, you can break up the viewing if you need to, unlike a theatrical release where you're forced into sitting for the entire length.  And, with regards to comparing this to other Scorsese movies: it is not on the same level as Goodfellas or Raging Bull, IMO.  For those who have had issues with De Niro playing a very young man during the course of the film - yes, I was distracted by it as well.  I mean, who came up with those weird blue contact lenses?  Sorry, but he was too old to play the character he was asked to. The \"de-aging software\" did not work.  Perhaps it could have been more powerful with a younger actor in the role they aged well.",

It was refreshing but suited him well and I am so glad he was nominated for this film. The highlight of this movie for me is the return to form for Al Pacino. Along with Stallone, Pacino is a saint in the Morizio household and his movies are scripture. I cannot adequately express the joy I felt seeing him in this meaty role. While this film may feel like a last hurrah for most people in it, it is also one of the best in their careers. Kinda like Scorsese's Abbey Road. It might also be my favourite Scorsese movie.

            "content": "Even as a Scorsese fan, this film disappointed. As much as I wanted to love this film, I was simply disappointed by the end result.\n\nFirst, the good. The source material this film uses tells the real-life mystery surrounding the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa. It shares the unlikely, yet true, story of Frank \"The Irishman\" Sheeran and his involvement in the Philadelphia mafia. This epic of a movie covers ~30-50 years and a large cast of interesting characters. All could have movies made about their own lives that would be as interesting.\n\nThe cinematography and choice of music is AAA+. I'd like to give Rodrigo Prieto special attention to the work that he did in this film. The plot is compelling and worthwhile.\n\nBut the flaws quickly come up. I found Scorsese's choice of actors unfitting for the story told. Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci are all well distinguished actors in their own regards. Yet, their age and cliched acting overpowered the positives that they offered. There was no single point in the film that I was convinced of Robert De Niro or Al Pacino were men in their 30s/40s. No amount of CGI de-aging could hide that fact.\n\nSeeing men in their 70s acts in a 3 hour film can make this a snoozefest for some of its viewers. That can be seen in the Netflix numbers showing the small number of viewers that actually make it to the end.\n\nAs many critics pointed out, I felt as if the long and winding story could have been told in a more concise manner. Action and scenes of significance happen far and few. Time is taken to build the world that Frank Sheeran existed in rather than moving the story. But some people will see that more as a pro than a con.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, I wanted to love this film. Yet, it fails to have the same cinematic magic that Scorsese has shown in his other work. The film disappears in the viewers mind as soon as they finish it, if not sooner. The film leaves no lasting impact on its viewers and will be overshadowed by Scorsese's earlier work.\n\n2/5. One star for plot, one for cinematography. It really took Scorsese 10+ years to make this film?",

They just do not make them like this anymore, and those who are predisposed to criticise the film because of recent comments made by Scorsese on the state of modern blockbusters - they were no more controversial than what you might expect your grandad to say about today's rap music - may be \"demonstrating a failure to show appreciation.\"",

But the bug stand out performance is Al Pacino as Jimmy Hoffa. His performance is magnificent from the moment he's introduced to his last scene, he just steals the entire film. The CGI de-ageing on RDR didn't look good when its first used, but after 10mins of seeing it, I had no problems with it being used on the 3 main actors... the direction by Scorsese is fantastic as always. The use of having long scenes where its just actors speaking is more interesting than the action scenes and that's down to the script and down to Scorsese brilliant filming mind set. The use of going back and front in time can be confusing to some people but it didn't bother me what so ever as it was important to the story telling... the only little criticism I would have is that maybe they could have trimmed the movie by a few minutes, as the runtime will be a big problem for some people, but I would have trimmed it by a few minutes. Not one of Scorsese best, but definitely in his top half of films.... this film is brilliant!!!!",

DeNiro delivers a phenomenal framing monologue running across the majority of the film, doing most of his acting in quiet observation and letting Steve Zaillian's breezy, colorfully dark screenplay do most of the work for him. It's a cooled-off performance departing from his recent cartoonish filmography and lets the character of Frank really run through him to life.\n\nThe slow, progressive cracking of the relationships binding them, the almost sociopathic incompatibility between his and the \"family's\" businesses and domestic life, it's really something, and brilliantly crafted on a filmic and reflective meta level on the part of Scorsese. 'The Irishman' isn't self-indulgent, but it works on layers upon layers as its own piece and even more as a pensive meditation on the specific contributions and winding themes the director has built over decades in the gangster genre.

            "content": "Okay, there is some good and some bad.  In general, this movie was the cinematic embodiment of Unisom and Melatonin.  3 and a half hours was roughly 2 hours too long.\nSo what was good?   Cinematography was amazing.  Scorsese pulls you back to the 60's and 70's in ways that is really hard to quantify.  You see it and feel the time in the gut.  The De-Aging done to the principles was outstanding as well.  It was so good that there was kind of a reality inversion going on with DeNiro.  Young DeNiro looked more real than Old DeNiro, to the point where Old DeNiro looked like a creepy bad makeup job on a younger actor.   If this movie deserves an Oscar, it's for the effects.  They were that good.\nNow for the other side.  The Story of Jimmy Hoffa would have made a Great 2 hour movie.  The story of Frank Sheeran would have made a pretty entertaining 2 hour movie.  The Irishman tried to blend the two and fails horribly.  The side story about Frank's daughter, Peggy, added nothing at all to the story.  If they had done more to introduce her, or to make her more interesting, or even tried to show why Frank seems to want her acceptance, there could have been something there.  Instead we get a few minutes of \"I don't know why my daughter doesn't like me\" and nothing about Frank's other daughters.  Paquin is horribly misused.\nNext we have Hoffa.  Al Pacino does a great job of convincing us that Jimmy Hoffa was a childish clown.  Hoffa has almost no depth.  The story gives you no real idea of how Hoffa became such a powerful leader of the Teamsters.\nPesci was a stand out.  He was convincing, slightly sinister, and came off as a kindly uncle most of the time.  At the appropriate moment, the kindly uncle slips away and the cold hearted gangster emerges.  He does more communicating with a nod and 1 or 2 lines than Pacino does through his whole arc.\nDeNiro, for such a fantastic actor in other movies, is just a block of wood throughout the movie.  He shows all the depth of a puddle on the pavement.  His facial expression almost never changes.  You get a little bit right at the beginning with Ray Romano.  Then the block of wood comes out for the next 3 hours.  You get a tiny bit more at the end, when he's with the priest at the very very end.  You get no emotion the entire time he's rising through the ranks as someone \"who paints houses\", nothing when he's with Hoffa.  Even when he is more or less pleading with Hoffa to change his ways before it's too late.  There is no emotion.  In those scenes I don't even get anything from Pacino.\nI did like a few bits.  The aside with Crazy Joe Gallo.  That was pretty interesting, especially when Frank details Where to kill Gallo, what weapons to use, why you want to shoot the bodyguard but not to kill him.  All that could have gone into a better, more focused movie.  I liked it any time Pesci was on screen.  At the end I was genuinely moved when a wheelchair bound Pesci jokes a bit about going to Church in prison, and then Frank narrates that he went to church, then the hospital, then the graveyard.  That was really good.  \nThe other neat thing the movie did was occasionally throwing up some captions over the face of certain minor characters detailing how they died.  \"Joe Blow, Shot 8 times in the face in 1973\" and similar.  That was a small bit of fun.\nSadly Pesci, the cinematography, and some of the other stuff does not save this incredibly long slog.  It was a chore to watch the buffoon and the block of wood interact.  I dozed a few times, having to rewind the film in case I missed something important.  After hour 2, I wasn't trying too hard.\nNot going to re-watch, and won't recommend this one.",

Two main things is the 'violent' scenes were poorly done, not very realistic at all. None of them were very vagarious and none made major impacts. The second star loss was for lack of things to keep your attention. I understand its over 3 hours but, if you plan on keeping an audience in a screen for that amount of time, you need to keep them involved. I felt my mind wondering during a lot of the scenes that were put there for no reason. Time filler. \n\nPacino made this movie. Without him, it would have been a major flop. I don't think it should have been released in the cinemas either. I felt like it was not worth my money. I would have preferred it at home. If you're used to Scorsese other films, you know how visceral they can be. This did not live up to expectations but, it was good none the less. I'm disappointing I couldn't tell people it was amazing. My hopes were up from the time they announced its production years ago. \n\nI would not watch this again. I feel its not worth another 3 hours. His previous films however, have so much 're-watchability' though. \n\n3 out of 5. It was good, not great. Violence wasn't violent, too much filler, other characters besides Pacino felt mediocre.",

            "content": "I'm afraid to review this film. I feel like I'm about to ruin my aspiring film critic career... Well, here it goes.\n\nFirst of all, Bobby Money doesn't look Irish to me. Maybe, this is just a stupid statement.\n\nSYNOPSIS: \nBased on a novel titled \"I Heard You Paint Houses\" and the true and mysterious disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa.\nFrank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) tells his story of when he became a hitman for Russel Bufalino (Joe Pesci) and what he remembers from the mysterious death of Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino).\n\nDIRECTION:\nBefore your head explodes, no, I don't have any issue with the directing. It's Marty Score-say-zee. For those who say \"Score-sessy\", shut up. Even if that's the correct pronunciation, shut your mouth. You just sound like a valley girl saying \"hawt\" instead of \"hot.\"--------- Anyway... Scorese- Marty is a phenomenal Director blah blah blah. We all know. That run-time though. Give me a break! This could've been 45 minutes shorter EASILY.\n\nWRITING:\nI want to extend on the run-time here. Cause though I didn't feel the writing was bad, by goodness should this script have been cut down far more. I have this theory that Marty loves the the structure of TV series where you can build characters over a long stretch of time and so he likes to add multiple scenes of his characters doing average day things to make you feel like they're not just cold-blooded, money hungry killers. However, most of these scenes don't move the story forward, it just slows the pace way down. I'm sorry, but is it a crime that while watching a film like this I want to learn more of the core plot and not watch a family Christmas get-together? Unlike a TV series where filler episodes are necessary at times, with a movie you have the luxury of cutting that out.\n\nACTING.\nRobert De Niro (or Bobby Money), Joe Pesci, Al Pacino, Harvey Keitel, Bobby Cannavale, Jesse Plemons. Am I good for this section? If I had to choose a standout for who I feel would have the best chance at an Oscar it would be Al Pacino. He definitely had the most showy role of every character, but he did a great job as Jimmy Hoffa. Loved his performance and they'll all get nominated. Maybe.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nLook, the direction is great and the acting a top notch, but for my own personal satisfaction I need a story that keeps me going. ESPECIALLY for a 210-minute run-time. The Wolf of Wall Street is a perfect example of using the most with a long run-time and that was Marty too so I know he's capable. There was a great story here, but unfortunately for me it was clouded far too much by unnecessary filler scenes that ultimately didn't make me any more connected to the characters. Speaking of characters, there's about 37 characters you're introduced to and the script finally focuses up on the 3 main character in the last hour to and hour and a half. Was really looking forward to this film and I'm disappointed.",

I'm also not overly familiar with crime movies either, but I can tell you I've never heard of a crime movie with a 3 and a half hour long runtime. I feel like this is really what sets this movie back, because there's clearly parts of the movie that can be cut out, even if these parts of the movie are a little fun to watch. I feel like this is a case of a director having TOO much freedom, such as Stephen King writing 1000-page novels. Having a movie with a 3 and a half hour runtime just isn't something many people can watch all the way through without feel bored or tired of the same thing. Nonetheless I'm happy this is on Netflix, because I probably wouldn't have seen it in a theatre. Anyways, as for the movie itself, it's great.

The Irishman is like a journey through that world and that piece of american history.

Firstly, its quality. It's undeniable that when you've been in the business for so long and proving and improving your talent over and over again such as the team behind this movie you know how to put together an excellent piece of art. They don't put one foot out of place - direction, acting, cinematography, sound, costuming, setting - it's fine-tuned and truly shows off the expertise behind it. You watch it like you are actually looking in on the real events in real time and experiencing the story as it happened.\nSecondly, and I think most notably, its emotion - something you don't often find when watching a mobster story from the perspective of a mobster. It's De Niro that really manages to pull you in and take you on the journey - draw you into his mindset and his loyalty so you are seeing the events and characters through his eyes and with what seems to be his heart. It's De Niro's incredible depth as an actor (those eyes!) that makes the movie hit so beautifully.

            "content": "November 27, 2019\n\nIt's a good thing \"The Irishman\" is three and a half hours long, because it takes a while for the film to gain traction. Don't get me wrong\u2014the plot is always interesting and the production as a whole is a treat for any film buff who's been yearning to see Martin Scorsese direct his good friends Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Harvey Keitel, and, for the first time, Al Pacino, in yet another epic crime drama. But it's not until the film's halfway mark or so that we really start to appreciate \"The Irishman\" on its own terms rather than as a callback to the director and actors' previous collaborations. It's as if Scorsese and company felt they first had to make the audience comfortable by giving us what we've come to expect from both them and the genre before telling a deeper, more unique story. \n\nThose previous collaborations, of course, include \"Mean Streets,\" \"Raging Bull,\" \"Casino,\" and the oft-considered crowning achievement of their careers, \"Goodfellas.\" And for much of \"The Irishman,\" I got the impression it was merely trying to live up to these other works and was overly self-conscious about reminding viewers of their quality and influence by trying to copy them. Because Scorsese and his team essentially wrote the book on the quintessential mob movie (with the exception of \"Raging Bull\"), perhaps they thought adhering to their own template was all \"The Irishman\" had to do in order to win the audience over. \n\nAnd for some viewers, that may be enough, but I wanted \"The Irishman\" to be the filmmakers and actors' opportunity to evolve the template, even though some of its qualities still function as a way to introduce and place viewers inside the film's dark and unsettling world. These include the underlying story\u2014just as it was in \"Mean Streets,\" \"Casino\" and \"Goodfellas\"\u2014serving as a cautionary tale about complicated, amoral men aspiring to rise through the ranks of organized crime. Over the course of several decades, they'll work to increase their power and maintain their status in order to leave what they believe will be an indelible mark on society. It's cautionary because the question eventually becomes, to what meaningful end does a life of crime ultimately lead? As the other films and now this one show, obtaining power for power's sake can leave one feeling empty, scared and alone. \n\nScorsese once again employs his trademark voice-over to navigate us through this fable. The voice belongs to Frank Sheeran (De Niro), who, in late 2003, is an octogenarian now confined to a wheelchair in a lowly nursing home outside Philadelphia. He takes us back 50 years and tells us about his \"career\" in the mafia. Steven Zaillian's screenplay is mostly linear in the way it adapts Charles Brandt's supposedly non-fiction novel, \"I Heard You Paint Houses,\" the title of which is a euphemism spoken between Sheeran and his crime bosses that basically translates to, \"I heard you're willing to kill people [and therefore paint the walls with blood].\" Sheeran, as we'll see throughout the film, painted many houses indeed.\n\nBut Sheeran wasn't just a hitman for his boss and mentor, Russell Bufalino (a quiet and tame Joe Pesci), whose physical stature may have been short but his influence as a don operating out of Northern Pennsylvania stretched quite far. On any given day, Sheeran could be Bufalino's driver, messenger, drinking partner, or close confidante. They first meet when Russell helps Frank fix his meat delivery truck, which he uses to steal meat and give to Skinny Razor (Bobby Cannavale), the head of a small-time crime circuit. Sheeran and Russell meet again more formally after Russell's lawyer cousin, Bill Bufalino (Ray Romano), gets Frank off on theft charges. Convinced this \"Irishman\" is reliable, loyal and docile after he refuses to name names in his meat-stealing operation, Russell enlists Frank for various jobs and soon becomes an important figure in the Bufalino's illegitimate doings. \n\nEventually, one of Frank's duties is to act as conduit and unofficial keeper of the peace between the Bufalinos and Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), the outspoken president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, who had longtime ties with the mob. Like Russell, Hoffa admires Frank for his fidelity and they too become close friends, with Hoffa going so far as to win the affection of Frank's daughter Peggy (Lucy Gallina and Anna Paquin), who's always suspicious of her father's shady affairs.\n\nWith its tried-and-true formula and archetypal characters in place, \"The Irishman,\" for much of its run, essentially goes through the motions of a typical Hollywood mob movie, showing us various mob family matters (weddings, holidays, baptisms) and the roles the family played in certain historical even. We see, for instance, how Hoffa reacted to the Kennedy assassination and that his being the target of Robert Kennedy eventually led to his conviction of jury tampering and a four-year stint in prison, where his rocky relationship with fellow Teamster Anthony \"Tony Pro\" Provenzano (Stephen Graham) became even rockier. Several notorious men from Bufalino and Hoffa's inner circles also appear on-screen and we read subtitles detailing their history and cause of death, among other things, so the film does a commendable job of trying to be both entertaining and educational.\n\nBut even though everything the film tells us is interesting and easy to grasp, I was hoping that by this point in his career, Scorsese would try a different strategy to expose us to this history and world. For its first two acts, there's something about \"The Irishman\" that feels too clear-cut and straightforward. It doesn't take many risks from neither a filmmaking nor narrative standpoint. It surprised me to think Scorsese would be okay with sticking to such a somewhat standard format because it's one we've seen many times from movies of this type. Would Scorsese really just present things his usual way and that would be it?\n\nLuckily, that's not it, because right around the halfway mark, my faith in the picture started to rise as it shifted from a mostly routine genre picture to a slow and quietly observant human drama that seeks to demystify and de-romanticize a life in the mob. If the first half makes Frank's \"adventures\" seem like those found in a conventional Hollywood mob movie, the second is a solemn look at the way a life in organized crime can become a thankless and vicious cycle, one in which a \"many-hats-wearing\" guy like Frank is always beholden to someone in a higher position of authority and never able to fully relax. \n\nWe begin to empathize with Frank as we get a better feel for just how downright frustrating his job can be, what with his having to drive a truck cross-country, hop on a plane, deliver a package, kill a man, etc., all at a moment's notice and all without asking questions. When Zaillian's screenplay becomes more screen direction than dialogue and we simply watch Frank carry out the orders of his boss in long, uninterrupted stretches, we really absorb the film and its themes more. Even though Scorsese's precise eye, combined with director of photography Rodrigo Prieto's vibrant imagery and Bob Shaw's production design are felt throughout, it's when the film slows down that we notice all of them on a deeper level and they become more penetrating.\n\nIt's also at this point we're reminded of Robert De Niro's raw talent as an actor because for much of the latter half of the film he has to perform without the aid of dialogue and rely on his own body gestures, facial features and internal thoughts to convey Frank's dilemma and irritation. It also dawns on us that, in many ways, De Niro has been playing against type this whole time. We're so used to seeing him as the man in charge and a hard-knuckled tough guy, and even though he portrays Sheeran as merciless at times, here we see him credibly nervous, hesitant and beating around the bush with Russell and Hoffa in order to appease them, and the anxiety Frank feels allows us to view him as human and vulnerable. We listen to his narration more intently as the film goes on and we come to care about this remorseful and lonely individual, even though is behavior is reprehensible.\n\n\"The Irishman,\" whether true or not (there have been various articles discrediting Sheeran's accounts of the facts), is always well made, and on the whole, it ranges from good to very good, but I hesitate to call it great because it takes too long to break away from its initially traditional formula and establish its own identity, eventually showing us an aspect of organized crime we might not have considered or experienced before. Even if isn't up to masterpiece level, the directing, acting and production values are strong and watchable enough that there's never anything outright bad to say about the movie, which is remarkable given its runtime. But should Scorsese and company ever unite again in their lifetimes, I hope they consider progressing their own standards and pushing viewers outside their comfort zones earlier on.",

Performances were also tired. Accents and mannerisms of several characters were inconsistent from point to point int the film. The ending should have ended 10 minutes before it did. The last 20% does revisit Scorsese's ongoing preoccupation with or grapplng match between morality vs nihilism, which I always find kinda interesting -- the inquiry is present in every one of his non-documentary films.  Is The Irishman \"cinema\" as Scorsese defines it? I'd say yes, tho not tremendously good cinema.",

If you've liked Marin Scorsese's style when it comes to gangster flicks, you'll probably find some enjoyment in this movie. I do feel the movie is not as good as other entries from the acclaimed director such as \"Goodfellas\" and \"Casino\" and that's primarily because, for most of the runtime, the movie doesn't really have much of a plot. The characters are interested and every big-name actor does a fantastic job, but for about two and a half hours of this movie, I felt the pacing was very uneven. Somehow though, Scorsese managed to win me over with a knockout final hour that is engaging and carries a lot of dramatic weight. This last act really brings everything together and showcases the point of the movie nicely. Overall, it's not among Scorsese's best films and the pacing can be uneven because the movie is so long, but because of the final act and strong performances, the movie manages to leave a considerable impact.",

However, as all of his movies do, The Irishman is deeply reflective onto himself, a look back onto his life from old age. A look back at friends, life, and betrayal. Lacking the gratuitous violence of his previous mobster movies, Scorsese weaves a beautiful epic on the reality of the mob. Frank is one of the only mobsters escaping execution, as we learn from the character descriptions upon meeting. I absolutely loved it. At the end of his life, Frank realizes ponders on the impact of his life. So many bodies, not enough happiness. As dreary as this sounds, Scorsese beautifully weaves this into the friendship between De Niro, Pacino and Pesci. A must-see for cinephiles, as for anyone else who admires the drama of betrayal. While not gripping from the action, it is still tense with amazing pacing. Scorsese is immortal through his works, and in his legacy, he leaves his piece de resistance The Irishman in his wake as one of his modern works. Gaze upon the greatness of everyone in the movie, this is rare. The Irishman belongs to the ages. 100% recommend.",
