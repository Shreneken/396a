The songs are amazing,If I could choose to watch one movie for the rest of my life this would be the one I'd choose,Other than the unnecessary song they added that Beyonce sings ,all the rest of the songs are amazing and so catchy I will never get bored of this movie,although I know nearly know nothing about CGI,The movie is clear and very realistic, over all I have to say this movie gets a 93% If it wasnt for the Scene where simba talks to his dead father Id give this a 98%",

The acting is alright, but it feels like the actors were just doing imitations of the original characters, with nothing special added. The pacing is slow, and the film takes out some of the best parts of the original. It is a fun film to watch, but if you have access to the original, I highly recommend watching that instead. The story, characters and the overall feel of the original is much more engaging and meaningful. The animation is impressive but the story and emotions are not as good as the original. Overall, The Lion King (2019) is a decent film, but it falls short in comparison to the original. I give it a 6 out of 10.",

If it was a re-imagining, where they took the basic premisse of the story and turned it into something that benefited narratively from looking more realistic, then that would be fine.\nBut they took the same skript, the same story (a skript and story that, to make it clear again, was made for a cartoony animated feature) and then just... turned up the \"realism\".\nWhich results in \"realistic\" animals that have no facial expressions and move like real animals... but behave in the context of the story like no animal would.\nSome people like it because it looks realistic, but so far I haven't seen anybody explain what the story actually GAINS from looking like this. While it's very, very obvious what it LOSES. It loses character, it loses emotions. It loses so much of what made the original so great. Without gaining anything.\n\nIf you want to be baffled by some impressive tech demo, then... sure, watch it. Or maybe watch the trailer and some individual scenes, because no tech demo should be 2 hours long.\nIf you want to see this story, told competently, with characters and moments that will stick with you for decades... go back and watch the original.

            "content": "Watching this visually more of a live action type film (although it is primarily filmed using CGI but appears more like a live action film),  it brought back old memories of the original cartoon version - nice memories, thankfully. The themes of loss and self identity are timeless ones and the whole 'Circle of Life'  aspect is somewhat poignant at the moment too (this review dates from March 2020). The cinematography I thought was undoubtedly impressive and I very much appreciated seeing it in the Blu-Ray format - in these days of lowering numbers of new films being released in the Blu-Ray format, I'm glad this one was. The voice acting/vocal performances are also quite impressive. I enjoyed it as an adult watching it, with nostalgia for the original version, which was released when I was in my tween years (I think I was about 12 when it came out in the mid 1990s). I would definitely recommend this film to fans of the original, if your ok with the idea of a live action version of this, like the (also recent) live action/CGI version of The Jungle Book. If CGI doesn't appeal to you, then you may not be so impressed but that goes without saying.\n\nThe only other thing I'd like to add is that if your considering this to show to young kids, I would warn that some scenes could be reasonably frightening to very young kids, due to the nature of the scenes - the themes present, i.e. death, fighting etc. Violence is certainly implied, although I wouldn't say its full of bloody violence as such but very young kids probably would be better with the cartoon version, hence the PG rating this film has been given in the UK. At a rough guess, I'd say kids maybe around about 8 or 9 or older should be ok with this, in my opinion.",

Also, it is a musical, however they managed to ruin the music by just shoving the familiar pieces into scenes they were not meant to be in, just for the sake of nostalgia. They gave the roles to mostly untalented people, celebrities or actors who either couldn't sing or act, or both. They brought back James Earl Jones to play Mufasa, but he has lost the power in his voice to really make the character shine like in 1994. Now he just sounds like an old geezer, and they even placed unused clips/takes from the 1994 movie in place of some scenes in this 2019 movie. Again, they brought back James Earl Jones, but didn't bring back Jeremy Irons as Scar, who is easily one of the best performed characters and Disney villains in history. Makes completely no sense. The director picked and chose what would be in this movie, which was intended to be \"like a documentary\" and \"be more realistic\" in a movie that featured talking and singing  animals. The only reason this movie did so well at the box office is because of the nostalgia factor, but ultimately is no match for the 1994 animated classic in terms of quality. If you want to watch a good version of this movie, watch the 1994 movie and don't buy into these Disney cash grabs which just want to siphon money from you because it reminded you of your childhood.",

            "content": "1994's 'The Lion King' is not just one of my favourite Disney films, it is also one of my favourite animated films and one of my favourites overall. Beautiful animation, some of Disney's most iconic songs and amazing score, an entertaining and powerful story with unforgettable moments, terrific voices (especially James Earl Jones and Jeremy Irons) and joint best beginning to a Disney film alongside 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame'.\n\nDisney's live action films are often frowned upon, they often have been described as pointless and many feel that Disney are running out of ideas. Can totally understand this, as the small handful that have been made so far have not really been necessary but the quality of them have varied. 'Cinderella' and 'The Jungle Book' were great and by far the best of the remakes, but the rest have left me mixed. Will admit to not really seeing the point of this version and was not massively impressed by the trailer, but saw it anyway being such a fan of Disney and because my sister desperately wanted to see it. Watching it way back when it first came out but with being behind with my reviewing it took me to now to review it, it was a little better than expected and not as bad as others have said. My sister did like it a lot better than me, with my feelings being quite lukewarm. Am really trying not to compare and try and judge it on its own terms, but sometimes it is hard when the quality of a remake, follow up or another adaptation is very far removed from something so good and that is the case with comparing both 'The Lion King' films.\n\n'The Lion King' (2019) does have good things. The best thing about it by a mile is the visuals, which are absolutely fantastic. Something of a technical achievement, with the scenery being breathtaking in every sense (\"Circle of Life\" being a notable example) and the characters (excepting their eyes needing more expression) blend very realistically in a way where one gets the sense that this was a nature documentary. The score is still powerful, especially in the stampede and one of Disnney's most iconic tear-jerkers. Have always loved the songs, and with two exceptions they still make an impact. \"Circle of Life\" is truly awe-inspiring and the closest the film came to making me cry.\n\nMost of the dialogue has some moments of humour (Timon and Pumbaa) and tension (the hyenas). The story has its moments. Can not praise \"Circle of Life\" enough, Timon and Pumbaa are amusing and the stampede is intense, not goosebump-inducing though, even though everybody who has seen the original will know the outcome. Making the hyenas scarier and fleshing out the lionesses (a little) more were good moves. Actually thought that a lot of the voice work was not bad at all, Billy Eichner and Seth Rogan being so much fun and by far the best faring of the voices, they were clearly having fun too with the improvising and their comic timing is full of exuberance not obvious elsewhere. Florence Kasumba's Shenzai is very different, the opposite in fact, to Whoopi Goldberg's, and the more sinister edge worked very well. James Earl Jones, the only voice actor to reprise his role, still has Mufasa's booming dignity and Donald Glover does quite well.\n\nDidn't care for some however. Was mixed on John Oliver, who is fun but overdoes it at times. Beyonce comes over as very out of place, her voice not fitting how Nala looks, and she even sounded bored. Chiwetel Eijofor, a good actor who was brilliant in '12 Years a Slave', was the biggest disappointment, found him too subdued for Scar and he is nowhere near as menacing or enjoys himself as much as Irons (whose voice work is some of the best for any Disney, and animated, film). While \"Circle of Life\", \"I Just Can't Wait to be King\" and \"Hakuna Matata\" come off well (especially \"Circle of Life\"), \"Be Prepared\" was bizarre and quite over the top, what a way to waste one of the greatest Disney villain songs. \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" was reminiscent of decent at best karaoke. \"Spirit\" is even worse, that did not fit within the film and was more an excuse for Beyonce to show off her vocal chops and have actually heard much better singing from her.\n\nExcepting the hyenas being scarier, some additional dialogue and the lionesses being more fleshed out, 'The Lion King' suffers from being too faithful and not having enough of its own identity. Too many of the scenes are near-carbon copies with only fleeting moments of heart and soul, mostly the film emotionally is very bland. The big death scene, heart-wrenching before, is treated in too throwaway a fashion. The additional dialogue and any interpolations are not for the better either and actually rather jar, while the cuts and changes were not necessary. The eyes and facial expressions for the characters, especially Scar, lack nuance and are at times borderline creepy.\n\nSumming up, found a lot to like but was disappointed overall. 6/10",

Then again, that's the only thing special about this film - the visuals. Apart from that, just about every inch of this movie is exactly the same as its 1994 counterpart. \n\nThe Lion King is a story about a young lion cub called Simba (Donald Glover) whose father is killed by his uncle, Scar (Chiwetel Ejiofor); after being cast out, he must return to save his pride, and take his rightful role as king of the Pride Lands. \nYes, the animations are spectacular and yes, the scenes contain fresh perceptions, but the remake is just that: a remake. There's just about no originality, and no new points or characters to the plot. If you wanted to watch \"the Lion King\", the 2019 version really doesn't offer any upsides.\n \nThe one special thing about this remake, however, is of course its animation, but a \"live action\" reboot - without any live action at all - actually ruins a lot of the movie.\nWatching lifelike animals belt out lyrics is a lot harder to stomach than animated lions. For instance, their mouths seem strange and robotic, and we just cannot suspend our disbelief. Throughout the entire movie, I found myself drifting away from the musical numbers and wishing I could've been back home instead of watching a lion cub sing the exact same songs as the original. \n\nIn my opinion, a movie that isn't believable is a movie not worth watching. Sure, the movie's great, but the format of the animation just wasn't worth it. The original 1994 version had all of the perks and none of the disadvantages. \n\nIf you want to enjoy this classic, why not just watch the classic? The hype of this remake is unwarranted and, in every aspect, the 1994 original is much better. If you liked the animation, just watch a Nat Geo documentary on lions. Trust me, you'll enjoy it a lot more.",

But personally, I think they did a great job. It's just that the characters couldn't \"act\" so well because they were made to look like real animals, hence they had no eyebrows and their facial expressions were limited. But with the help of a great script, direction and music, they were still able to capture the essence of the original 1994 animated film. Having a great ensemble cast of African Americans as voice actors was a great idea. It enhanced the characters with better accents and personalities. I'm glad they still got the irreplaceable James Earl Jones to voice Mufasa, but I did miss Jeremy Irons, Nathan Lane and Whoopi Goldberg. The tragic scene was still effective, though a little bit diminished. Scar was still viciously highlighted as the main villain. Timon and Pumbaa were still hilarious. I just wished they featured more songs. Overall, the first animated movie is still king, but I greatly enjoyed this new version and I think they were still able to revive the same endearing story that made us laugh and cry a few of decades ago.",

Out of all the films released by Disney in the live action adaption lineup, this one by far is the most disappointing so far. The film doesn't try and be something different, it tries to copy the original note for note, but misses the parts that made the original so great. The plot of The Lion King by itself is just the story of Hamlet with animals, what made The Lion King the masterpiece it was before, was the characters, color, and imaginative fun. With that gone we just have a strange retelling of Hamlet with animals. I am sure there are some people who will enjoy this film, and some who will think it is better than the original, but I am not one of those people. For families looking to see this one, I suggest playing the original animated film for your kids instead and they will get a lot more out of it.",

However for it's credit, this remake did not want to make me leave the theater in disgust. If anything it's a good movie that it's worth a watch, you just gotta dial down your expectations of the movie because some parts of it are kinda watered down and a bit of filler moments are put in there too which would explain this movie being 25 minutes longer than the original. Other than that, it does follow the script to the letter and makes for a good nostalgia high with modernized graphics. Props to the CGI team, this movie does look beautiful, probably the highest mark of the movie. \n\nIt's not a bad Disney movie at all, the unfortunate part is that it does not surpass what the animated classic has already brought out to us and those are shoes that are almost impossible to fill so I can understand this movie falling short in some parts.

Excellent voice and vocal performances couple with stunningly life-like depictions of wild Africa and it's animal inhabitants to satisfy fans hoping to relive an old favorite, while offering new viewers an experience approximate to what the rest of us experienced in 1994, albeit with less facially emotive animals.",

Disney did such a good job on the animations, the animals move realistically, they look realistic and if animals could talk, this is how they would look while talking. A lot of people are hating on this movie to be part of the crowd, I give this 5 stars because the story wasn't changed, the CG is seriously mind blowing, the soundtrack was done in justice, it's darker than the animated original and it was pretty action filled. \n\nI feel this movie benefits from its live action.

For CGI, some points I was convinced that it was real animals. It's hard to explain how it missed the mark, even though it was done beautifully. I also don't think its suitable for young kids, unlike the original movie. I feel like the realism could scare the younger generation who watch this. I wish they had updated the new film, maybe add some new scenes that wasn't in the original, and maybe a new song or two. As much as I love beyonce, I feel like she was overpowering when it came to her songs, drowning out her male counterpart in most songs. Also I didn't like how much beyonce styled the song to her, the countless of rifts in places where it should have been a simple note. I say overall if you're going to make a remake, keep it as close to the original not how this movie was made. things such as the songs and what the characters look like, should be a minimum requirement/goal.

If you're going to reboot something then you either need to take the original and improve upon virtually every element of it, or basically rewrite the script while keeping the same basic premise. This film fails to do either of these: every song is inferior to the original version and the stage show, the script and storyline is almost the same but told by characters who have far less personality, the voice acting is average for the most part (although I quite enjoyed Scar for the alternative take on the character as more quiet and manipulative than the original) and I found myself just generally caring less about the whole thing. The elephant graveyard scene stood out in particular - the pace felt all wrong, and it somehow managed to lack in drama and suspense when compared with the original scene. In fact for the full movie I was forcing myself to watch it to the end, just in case it improved as it progresses. \n\nThe one thing I will praise is the cgi, which is very impressive for the majority of the film. There are a few moments where a plant or something doesn't look quite right, but on the whole it's visually impressive. Sadly, this also results in everything somehow feeling more lifeless than the original film.\n\nI would say if you really enjoyed the original Lion King then don't watch this. You'll find yourself cringing at moments which haven't been handled as well as the original, from Mufasa's death to the use of Pumba as live bait. All of it just falls flat - less humour, less emotion, less excitement, less suspense and all around a less enjoyable watch. What were they thinking?",

For me, as a Disney lover, I am extremely infatuated with this version because the content is as same as the cartoon version and they make lions very powerful and baby Simba very touch my heart. Also, attacks my heart, the scene that Mufasa (Simba's dad) dead and Simba comes to see his dad. It makes my tears. For Scar (Simba's uncle) the script, personality, facial expression very represents the villain. Even, the Hyenas (underling of Scar) also represents the villain.\n\tThis version shows everything about the cartoon version. Included the romance scene that Simba and Nara (Simba's crush) met each other again. They represent the cuteness and love that they show to each other. This scene I highly recommend you to watch it because the mood and tone are very beautiful also the music that plays it very emotional. Another scene that I think is very impactful is the scene that Scar rules the kingdom and the land is dried, the kingdom lack abundance, the tree is dead, Scar hunting every day, and too much. I also like this scene because their 4g can show the lacking and make the kingdom not livable. But nobody can offend.\t\nAnother scene that I think shows the power is Simba's fight with Scar. Before having this scene, Simba decided to come back and protect his kingdom but the biggest problem is Scar. So, they get the fight that I have said this scene shows the power because it is fierce fight and vehement in combination with the effect of fire behind the fight it makes the fight more impassioned.\t\nHowever, for this version, I did not see the rule of Rafiki (monkey that carries Simba at the beginning), in this version it just came out a few scenes. In my point of view, in the cartoon version, the rule of Rafiki is more showed. Anyway, I truly love this version and I also recommend for those who are Disney or Lion King fan. This movie both kids and adults can watch it!",

My favorite characters/actors were either John Oliver as Zazu or Seth Rogen as Pumbaa. And as always, the CGI and special FX are top notch.

I just can't wait to be king was visually and musically ugly. The Stampede scene rather than be an emotional scene made me laugh. The acting was terrible. When will directors realize Beyonc\u00e9 while an amazing singer can't act? The kid who played young Simba cannot act nor sing. Keep in mind. Poor James Earl Jones sounded tired and bored. Bringing him back was a mistake. The guy who played Scar did a decent job but it was poor directing. The difference between the 1994 one and the 2019 is night and day. It's clear they were trying to hold on the nostalgia while trying to do something different. You can't do one or the other with the Lion King! If you want that nostalgia here's a tip just watch the 1994 one. Its more visually stunning. has better acting, better music and you will get the nostalgia you crave. It would have been better to have the Broadway play on Disney+. Its a better retelling then this godawful remake!",

Don't get me wrong, I do think this remake did things right in certain cases. It expanded on the relationship between lions and hyenas while explaining that overhunting is what killed the pridelands under Scar's reign, so it wasn't some force of magic. However, I do feel like this movie would've done better if it didn't try to simply recreate what was already there. It's like listening to all the same lines as the original, but the voice acting now had to carry all the emotional weight required to empathize with the characters, and it wasn't enough. Visuals and  vocals really need to work with and compliment one another to create the right tones.\n\nThat said, this movie was also too long.

This entire movie except one shot is all computer generated and for many That is the biggest accomplishment this film has done. The film is just gorgeous to look at and all the animals are designed beautifully down to their slightest movements. The problem with this movie is that these animals cannot emit real looking emotions like in the cartoon. The animals just have the same look on their face in any emotional situation they are in. The film also at times is shot for shot for the cartoon, you can actually put the scenes side by side and it looks exactly the same. The voice actors all do a good job respectfully but they need to rely on the animal technology to give their performance a full ounce of emotional depth.

It was a great improvement, but I think this was the wrong story to be retold in such a way.\nCharacters lack facial expressions, which make it all the more harder for me to tell how they feel or sympathise with them. Scar kills Mufasa? I can't tell if he feels accomplished, guilty or indifferent as he stares down at his struggling brother.\nNatural lighting does not work well with emotional stories. One colour reflects only one, or none in some cases, emotion. A lack of an atmospheric change in lighting or music makes it so that during otherwise sad and emotional scenes I sit back and watch with complete indifference because the emotion that the movie wants to give to me simply isn't there. Darker lighting during sad scenes would have sufficed, but producers of this movie must have been far too fixated on making it so realistic that nothing before it could contest.\nThey use subtlety in all the wrong places. Points where exaggeration was needed to reflect the atmosphere back to those watching fell short. There is a lack of colour to set the mood of many scenes, a lack of pacing in scenes that should get your heart racing, and points where the movie has been improperly executed.\nWhen I watch Mufasa die in the original I still tear up to this day. But when watching the 2019 adaption I did not feel anything. Maybe that was because they completely cut out a part of Mufasa's line where he addresses Scar as his brother and pleads for help, instead remaking it into a line that only sounds like he is making a demand. Simba's reactions as he watches are laughable. The sense of a betrayal between two brothers was not there at all.\nWhilst the technological aspects of this movie are outstanding, that's all there is to it. This does not live up to the high standards that the 1994 version has set. The hyper realistic effects strip scenes of any emotion. No emotion, no atmospheric lighting, too quick of a pace in some otherwise important scenes.\nThis version is hard to watch when you know the original all too well. Unless you want to admire the graphics, my advice to you would be to stick with the original.",

That one did not rise above its originator but it had plenty of its own to offer too. \n\nThe only positive thing I can say about this film other than a few sparse laughs is that it is quite sound, technically speaking. It's hard to not give credit to the animators, doing their damnedest to make this look like it could have been cut together from extra PLANET EARTH footage. But even that department isn't without its failures.\n\nThe biggest issue I have with the film is perhaps one of the least quantifiable, but if you watch the 94 animation and this in proximity I have little doubt you'll know what I mean. It is soulless. \n\nFrom the persistent blank expressions of animals wholly unable to show their emotion, to some absolutely horrendous line reads (just about every line from baby Simba is pathetic, with an irritating high-pitched sing-song quality to it). It seems as though even James Earl Jones was given no direction whatsoever, my guess being \"you've done this before James, just go nuts\". There's just no charisma between any 2 of the cast, with Timon and Pumba perhaps being the exception. They're an interesting take, though I wouldn't call it a good one. \n\nThe music is fine, but the musical numbers on the other hand are dreck. Part of the problem of having big name vocal artists doing voices is that they almost certainly came with the caveat of having them perform the songs themselves.  Nala, for instance, only ever sings as a cub in the original. Yet here, she sings an overwrought duet of \"Can you feel the love tonight?\" with Donald Glover, the two lions singing about themselves.. but it isn't actually them singing? Glover does a fair enough job though he has to restrain himself. Bey on the other hand.. oh my.   \n\nShe is bringing that queen bee energy whether you want it or not. The added song\nis also a solid \"no thanks\"\n\nI could go on for days but It honestly isn't worth the time. Sorry y'all, this one's gonna be a skip-it.",

I decided to give the movie a try and honestly I did not regret enjoying it. I will admit it's not perfect, but it was fairly good. There were indeed lack of facial expression from the characters, but did you honestly think an actual animal would make a human like facial expression? The body language speaks words and another thing to talk about is the Pumba and Timone duo with their funny scenes there were also tensing parts of them movie specially at the last part!  This movie to me was the missing piece i was looking for in the classic cartoon. It added depths to the classic one and if anything made me love The Lion King even more. I have no knowledge of how  critiquing movies works and once again, an opinion from a 16 year old. Do please watch the movie with an open mind and expect there to be changes to everything.

John Favreau has made a few decent films in the past, like Iron Man, Elf, Chef, and the remake of The Jungle Book, but it seemed like he bit off more than he can chew with this one, just feeling very uninspired, dragged out, and bland.\n\nThis is just another movie that falls under the category of a cash grab. With the popularity the movie already has, this remake made a CRAZY 1.65 billion dollars (which is only $200,000 off of what the original made) at the box office, currently ranked in the top 10 of all time. There's not really much to say about the characters or screenplay because, everything is the fucking same as the first. One of the biggest issues I had with the characters, I didn't particularly care for the voice overs as a whole, also their mouths transitions didn't match when someone tried to hit a high note or scream.\n\nThe best pieces of this film, is the cinematography & animations. The scenery is done so well, that you really feel like you're in Africa, with cutting-edge detail in everything!\n\nOverall, If you were wanting a better look, with the same story, you'll love the film; If you went in expecting a creative twist, chances are you're going to feel the same way as me.",

So it would seem natural to have him updating another Disney animated jungle movie.\n\nThe heavily Osamu Tezuka \"inspired\" THE LION KING, in itself it terrific animated feature benefiting from outstanding animation amazing music and Powerful drama, didn't really seem like it needed to be remade. And the case can certainly be made that in fact it should never have been.\n\nPretty much everything that is good about the film already existed in the previous incarnation; the mise en scene, the music, the story-line... nothing much new is added in Jon Favreau's version. And while the BBC nature Aesthetics seemed intriguing at first, in the end we lose the expressiveness of the original animation which made the drama more potent and Powerful.\n\nWhat we are left with is a pretty, yet pointless remake, that does nothing to improve on the original.",

Because the copy was so precise, it left me wondering why bother? Why not just film the Broadway play? The audience probably would have a better reaction to something \"based on\" the original instead of just a copy. Some of the second half of the movie was changed up a bit. Overall, this version was enjoyable, but doesn't have the classic feel of the original. Rafiki wasn't nearly as fun and didn't have the shaman feel that the late Robert Guillaume gave to the original. Like with any CGI rendering of a live being, the facial expressions of the animals weren't as effective as the cartoon drawn version. Scar, while quite evil, didn't have the same smarmy feel of the original. I guess in short, if you judge it by the original, it doesn't measure up.

However, comparing this 2019 remake to the 1994 classic \"The Lion King\" is like comparing \"The Force Awakens\" to \"A New Hope.\" While it does an okay job, it pales in comparison to the original. The inherent problem with Disney's recent string of remakes is that it really is a double-edged sword: if they deviate too much from the source material, the movie will be bad because it isn't a faithful adaptation. And vice versa, if they make a film that is too similar to the source material, it will be bad because it's basically the same movie. The only way Disney could stop losing creative force would be to stop making these remakes altogether, but we all know that this will not happen anytime soon. Money talks, after all, and most of these remakes have made at least a moderate profit at the box office. And that's exactly it: like all the remakes that came before and will come after it, the 2019 version of \"The Lion King\" is a cash-grab. It's basically the same movie, except without the heart, the spirit, or the talent of the original. The actors do fine, but their performances aren't as great as those of the cast of the 1994 original. James Earl Jones is the only actor who anywhere near lives up to the performance of the original actor -- mainly because he WAS the original actor for Mufasa. The 1994 original will always be a classic and a masterpiece. The 2019 remake does not, in any capacity, live up to the original. If you (somehow) have never seen the original, you'll probably like this one fine. But if you HAVE seen the original, and especially if you LIKE the original, I would give this one a skip.",

How does it change our way of thinking? That it doesn't reinvent itself is its shortcoming, but that's okay...it doesn't try to and it doesn't have to. Now, the real litmus test is what if for a second we can edit reality and both Lion Kings came out at the same time and there was no original and no remake...which one would be better? My guess is that the the public and critics would likely pick the animated version at a ratio of 4:1 because it's so hard to psychologically discount the \"original\" title...but if I'm honest, what the later version loses in vivid colors it more than compensates with majestic real life lions and African landscapes...I'll pick the later version by a hair...but given it's NOT the original, it won't rate quite as high...there's something to be said in honoring the creative value of an original story.",

Hopefully, Disney takes away from this and doesn't keep it too focused on realistic when it comes to The Little Mermaid, or we might end up with a realistic CGI Sebastian the crab with no personality\u2014no magical element. Maybe CGI that's not 100% realistic looking. More animated features and expressions would have helped were my thoughts throughout the film. Don't even get me started on the weird neutrality of the CGI genderless bodies and the removal of Rafiki's red bottom. Again, Disney should have mixed realistic CGI with magical theatrics to captivate the audience and bring the film to life.

A decent amount of lines from the original are left in, and a far greater amount of lines are just run through a thesaurus in a rather egregious manner. And how can you have a joke that literally only makes sense if you've seen the original movie??  Many parts are completely shot-for-shot, but other sequences are rather drawn out to show off what they could do with the CGI I guess, including a copycat of the ticket-out-of-the-window scene from Polar Express that includes giraffe dung ball instead of a snowball. \n\nThere is a complete lack of storytelling and dramatic sense.  Show, don't tell. There are multiple added scenes that do nothing for the plot. \n\nThe characters are almost completely flat, and purely rely on the fact that these are familiar characters. Random characters are added that add nothing to the plot, which apparently serve no other purpose than to have more voice parts on an extended version of the one song that wasn't originally written for the film, while at the same time lessening the emotional impact of Timon's and Pumbaa's parts of \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight?\"\n\nAny remake or adaptation should be able to stand on it's own, and this one certainly does not.

During the Disney renaissance, we had a voice director who wouldn't stop until every little detail was perfect, and it showed. I hoped for something similar here, but we were given table scraps pretending to be voice actors. They didn't care. The child actors alone.. awful. Our Lion King 2, a \"quick\" direct-to-video Disney sequel mind you, had fantastic child voice actors, what the snap is this..?! Timon and Pumbaa were the most tolerable, and it seems many people say this about the English dub as well. It didn't help that the dialogue came from the static faces of animal creatures that had no reason to be computer animated.

It had top tier visual effects that are beyond beautiful to behold, and yet I felt nothing.... It hit me and stood out like a gimmicky re-creation for a cash grab, a re-imagining that betrayed the soul and I was deftly amazed at how dissapointed and empty I felt. I actually felt shame.. like perhaps it was I whom had brought some unfounded or unrealistic expectations that I should have kept and checked at the gate before entering this world once again. It had the all encompassing splended visuals but hidden under all that brilliant gloss and artificially fantastic, fabricated effort was this absence of absolutely no heart and absolutely no soul in any of its characters at all.  My favorite characters were castrated and left as rendered, life-like caricature-zombie versions of themselves. It was numbing to observe and let sink in how they seemed as empty, hollow shells or shallow echoes only of their fomer pure, once thought indelible selves. Instead of getting lost inside this magnificent and exemplary world, I instead constantly found myself getting taken out and distracted by it...  How could they have allowed for this to occur? Dropping the proverbial ball here on something this important, impactful and grandose to us as I am speaking tentatively from the perspective of a 1990's child that unabashedly loved the original.

The technical aspects of this movie are certainly groundbreaking and impressive, but if anything it takes away from the magic of the 1994 movie and instead brings to us a tacky, copycat version. There is none of the same emotional connection to the characters that the original had because we lose the facial expressions, the cartoonish way the characters move, and the pure way it inspired the imagination. The story is still a precious one, but this movie adds nothing to improve it. The performances are mediocre and the imagery (while stunning) does not support this style of storytelling. Hand drawn animation is an art with more impact than people realize. This movie feels like an inauthentic cash grab.",

He has so many jokes that could get laughs, but John Oliver's voice is so bland that I swear an answering machine did the voice work. The songs are also mixed. While I enjoyed Hakuna Matata and The Circle of Life, Be Prepared and a few others were complete garbage. Also, there are only 3 scenes in this 2-hour film that seemed decent to me. The stampede was decent in that it looked nice and kept the action going. The second is Timon and Pumbaa convincing Simba to believe in the meaningless line of indifference because these are self-aware animals choosing not to be self-aware. The final and best one is The Lion Sleeps Tonight. This is the funniest, catchiest, and honestly most interesting scene in the whole film. It is the only thing truly expanded upon from the original for some reason. There are some good elements to the film, but most of it is garbage.",

The comedy was not there at all. This film skips jokes in the Original film and I never laughed. I only chuckled. This film misses the visual vibrant colors of the original film. Everything is natural pale colors. It misses it for me when it comes to the stampede scene. What this film does do is provide more drama to action scenes and context to Scar and Nola. Scar you almost feel why he is upset with why he has not come further and that his King role was taken away from him but we also see how he abused power in the Lion King more than the animated film. This film misses the emotional responses I should have like the Circle of Life or I am going to be a King. The Scar song is the one where it is the worst. The passing in this film is too quick and does not give enough time for this film to pause and breath. I did like some things like showing how Rafiki got Simba\u2019s Hair. I thought that characters who missed it for me in this film the most were Rafiki, Zazu\u2019s, Timon. They never hit the emotional response that I felt in the animated Lion King. Rafiki is missing his Kong Fu moves and Timon is missing the sarcasm. I do feel like the best songs in this film are the new songs during the end credits. The redone songs in this film did not hit me either. They missed the emotional response and took me out of the film. The stampede scene in this film is not as strong as the original animated film. The Animated one gives a much bigger emotional response and feels bigger in scope. The live action film feels more contained in the stampede scene. I don\u2019t feel a sense of danger in the stampede. I was impressed seeing thin to the bones Lions in the Lion King. I think adding that Scar over hunted in this film gave it more depth because that was not clear in the animated film. The animated film made it seem like Scar scared off all the animals. ",

His father (still James Earl Jones) gets murdered under questionable circumstances, so Simba flees the kingdom, only to later learn a life lesson and assume the responsibility he previously ran away from.  I'm very quickly reaching a point that I may just be skipping these movies altogether.  I've already vowed not to see these remakes in theaters so as to not inflate box office numbers, but the more I watch of these, the more I feel like I am just making extremely poor use of my time.  I'll just cut to the chase: if you've seen the 1994 animated featured, you've already seen this movie as well, and you've seen it done better.  Look, I know I am sound like I am coming down harshly on this, and if I am being honest, there are worse live-action remakes from Disney.  But with each one of these releases, I get more and more burnt out, and they've dropped four of these in the same calendar year.  I get that the technology is there for it, and the special effects admittedly look great, but they've sucked the life out of this story to the point that I think this is soulless.  It adds nothing to the already existing movie other than 30 minutes to the runtime, so why make it?  Well, this made $1.6 billion worldwide, so I get the real \"why,\" but for me, there just has to be more artistic integrity.  They got Jon Favreau to direct which makes total sense because of The Jungle Book, but I don't think I've seen him less inspired, and I have watched the majority of his library.  If we are getting down to brass tacks here, I think that Donald Glover is miscast as Simba.  Beyonc\u00e9 is really only here to do one thing, and it feels like cheating to put James Earl Jones back in the same part. Rafiki's role is so diminished that it might as well have been cut, and John Oliver is hit or miss as Zazu (for me, it's mostly missing).  The only two people I think that walk away from this looking good is Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen as Timon and Pumbaa.  They have some honestly good chemistry together, and it felt like they were actually in the same room together when they recorded their lines.  Even though they make one too many fart jokes, they were a breath of fresh air when I was all but ready to call it quits.  Even the music is a big step down for me.  No song is done better than the original, and you have Chiwetel Ejiofor totally Shatner-ing Be Prepared.  As you may expect, it's just embarrassing, and you think that it might be the low point, but just you wait.  They had the gall to make Can You Feel the Love Tonight take place in the broad daylight.  It is completely nonsensical, and it makes it all the more apparent how little quality control Disney has in these live-action remakes.  I do give points to Eichner, Rogen and the visual effects, but I cannot give you a single reason to watch this over the original.",

All the emotion of the movie seemed to have been drained away (I've head its because the faces couldn't be as expressive as the cartoon, but just listen to the intonation of scar's \"Run away Simba, and never return!\" line between the two movies and you'll see what I mean.  And the pacing was off: what should've been dramatic or urgent was drawn out, and parts that you needed a few moments to sink into were rushed over.  Oh, and the \"can you feel the love tonight\" scene was heartless.  I went to see this on a date and afterwards demanded we return home to watch the original that night!",

Not a complete and total copy minus a lot of the comedy that was in the original. The moments with Rafiki which I loved from the first, just fell flat in the remake. While I love John Oliver, Zazu had little presence. Billy Eichman as Timone was actually the only one who made me laugh out loud. With all the original cast members still alive, it would've been fun to have Whoopi back too! \nWith that said, as much as I love Jeremy Irons as Scar, Chiwetal was outstanding and you could feel every part of his acting coming through the character, he was maybe the only stand out in this movie. All in all, enjoyable to watch from a nostalgic view, but it made me want to watch the original instead.\nSo, Jon Favreau - if you get another chance- get creative and start from the beginning.",

I also think Beyonce as Nala was not the greatest choice. She does an okay job, but that's about it. There were also quite a few good parts to this. Timon and Pumbaa were played brilliantly, and added the right comedic touch that was needed. The CGI and visuals were both absolutely stunning.

I'll give it 5 years and we'll not be able to tell a 100% CG movie from a real one! I couldn't dive into the movie as a passenger because I was constantly blown away by the tech gone into every scene. The musculoskeletal work in every creature was astounding! The physics effects of hair and fur, the water tension of the piece of fur on the river, wind effects on trees and shrubs, the fire and smoke, they all blew my mind!\nIt's just a pity the animators leaned more toward realism as it took away the ability to exaggerate the animal expressions in the way a cartoon animation does. If you're going to anthropomorphise animals, why limit yourself so much to realism?\nMy only critique is because everything was so real, it sometimes got a bit hard to keep track of who was talking before I recognised who's voice was who's, because you only see their lips moving while their body is almost perfectly mimicking what the animal would do in nature. It was almost like watching a BBC wildlife documentary with dubbed in animal voices hehe.\nI still recommend it purely based on the technical marvel",

The depiction of these two things coupled with the song 'Circle of Life' which is the same as the animated version managed to stun when he saw this film.\n\nThis makes the audience look forward to the next scene. But here Disney makes a number of differences even in pleasant moments that don't last long, for example when romantic moments that should appear when they sing at dusk like in the animated version feel much different in this live-action version.\n\nEven so, this film can still make the viewer reminisce. Old songs like Hakuna Matata, I Just Can't Wait to be King, and Can You Feel the Love Tonight can still make the audience hum along.",

One thing that makes this film so much fun to watch are the songs that go along with it. The Lion King has an original song since it was first released in 1994. In this latest film, the songs are re-arranged using a choir as the background singer. The songs became truly beautiful and increasingly brought us to the atmosphere of the wild in the African forest. In addition, one other thing that makes this soundtrack even more special is Beyonce's appearance in the two songs in this film. Beyonce managed to bring a romantic atmosphere to the film when singing again \"You Can Feel The Love Tonight\" and success makes us excited through a song he wrote himself titled \"Spirit\". I gave it 5/5 stars.",

It is a photorealistic remake of Disney's traditionally animated film of the same name. \nThis movie has a classic case of rehashing the same story scene by scene with some dialogue changed up. Sometimes it worked, but more then often it didn't. It messed with a lot of the classic things we all know and love from the original Lion King, tweaked them into something new, but in the end never really pulled it off.\nI was really missing Jeremy Irons as Scar; Chiwetel Ejiofor just didn't bring anything to this character at all. He didn't seem menacing or scary for that matter. I remember watching the original movie and knowing that Scar is a villain that could get away with anything, and it was because of the voice acting done by Jeremy Irons. The only highlight in my opinion is Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner. Other than those two, it is a very forgettable and hollow version of the story.\nFirst let's start off with what I liked about the movie. The CGI. It is incredible, it's mesmerising and beautiful. But that's all it is, is beautiful CGI, they've completely lost sight of the story, the emotion and the magic. There is a lot of people that complain that the animals are too realistic, so they can't capture the raw emotion of the characters like you could in the 1994 Lion King. I don't believe that to be true. You can make things lack emotion psychically because they're a realistic looking animal, but it is then the actor portraying that character's job to bring the emotion to it. Unfortunately, not a lot could pull that off in this movie.\nOverall, this movie was one that I was really looking forward to and it let me down. The voice acting is forgettable almost as much as the story itself. I wouldn't be choosing this one over the original version to watch.\n2.5/5",

I guess first I will address the photo-realistic CGI elephant in the room, the animation. Not live-action, there's only one live-action shot in the entire movie. This is an animated film. And the animation is technically some of the most impressive ever put to screen. Seriously, this makes Life of Pi look like Madagascar by comparison. It was absolutely mesmerizing to watch...when the animals weren't talking. Whenever they were talking, it was awkward and laughably bad at times. What everyone has been saying is true, realistic animals cannot convey the emotions necessary for a story like this on their faces. In some scenes, I actually had trouble telling the characters apart or even understanding what was going on in the scene because of the lack of emotion on the characters' faces. That's a huge problem. I think Zazu got it the worst. Seriously, the animatronic birds in the Enchanted Tiki Room are more expressive than he is in this film! His face is frozen in a permanent frown, just like the real bird he's based on. The design does not fit the personality of the character at all. Same goes for most of the other characters. They were just off-putting. Speaking of the characters, how is the voice acting? While the film does feature a (mostly) talented cast, the dialogue in this movie is beyond awkward and the line delivery is just awful. I don't know how they possibly messed that up, but they found a way! It's very stilted and unnatural. The line delivery coupled with the characters' faces made me laugh out loud during Mufasa's death scene. Funniest shit I've seen in a movie all year. It's so bad, it's good! Look up the scene on YouTube, you'll be in for a laugh! As for the story, it's exactly the same as the original except they really nerfed the hyenas. They weren't funny and they weren't scary. They were boring. Eric Andr\u00e9 and Keegan-Michael Key are absolutely wasted in this movie. They also cut out the best song, Be Prepared, and cut most of Rafiki's interaction with Simba, the best scene! As for the comedy, it was just boring at best and absolutely obnoxious at worst. I'm not the biggest fan of Timon and Pumbaa, but I'll take the originals over these guys any day! Literally all of their jokes are self-referential. Sometimes the jokes don't even make sense unless you've seen the original, which you really should not do in a remake! As for the music, the score is just as amazing as the original but the songs are pretty bad, honestly. I already did a whole post about it months ago so I'll try not to repeat myself, but they are either butchered, cut, shoehorned in, copied or copy-pasted! The new Beyonc\u00e9 song especially sticks out like a sore thumb. Many of the most memorable scenes from the original are dumbed-down and heavily simplified to make them more realistic, I guess, but it just goes to show how traditional animation is the only medium this film can work in. In the 1940s, Disney was experimenting with giving the characters in Bambi a more realistic look. They decided against it and made them more stylized because the characters were not expressive enough to convey the emotions of the story. They knew doing something like this was a bad idea in the 40s! This movie is a mistake! I think that's all I have to say about this movie. It's just bad. Nothing about it works as a film. Just look up the opening scene on YouTube. That will give you just as much enjoyment as you would get from watching the whole movie. But yet again, just like Aladdin, it seems like most people disagree with me and love this movie. It's actually now the highest-grossing animated film of all-time. I can't even get angry at this movie anymore. It just makes me sad. Is this what Disney has become? What was once the company that defined the industry with their creative new takes on classic stories is now just regurgitating their old movies for profit? That just depresses me, honestly. Oh how the mighty have fallen. Oh well. At least Mulan looks kind of cool. Anyway, that's all I have to say about this POS. Don't bother, just watch the original. That's what I'm going to do, and I'm never going to think about this movie again.",

As I have talked about numerous times on this blog as they keep making these over and over inevitably they will run out of stories. However, they are still mostly well made and entertaining so they will keep making them until the well runs dry. So people can either choose to be grumpy and think their childhood is ruined, or they can try and see if these movies breathe new life in to these timeless tales.\n\nThis iteration of The Lion King, directed by the great Jon Favreau, is being billed as a live action re telling of the classic Hamlet esque tale. In a different sense though it is really just better version of CGI/Animation to just make it more life like. That is why I will be doing my Animation grades for this rather than the Stock Watch etc\u2026\n\nAnimation \u2013 A The visuals in this movie are truly incredible and make it seem like you are just watching Planet Earth, with a Lion King story.

Other than that the shots were all incredible, and the animals all felt super lifelike and dare we say, cute.\n\nVoice Cast \u2013 B- When we saw the announcement for this movie, the actors they got were a big part of the conversation. There was definitely a mixed bag though as there were some great performances and some so so ones. Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen as Timon and Pumbaa absolutely steal the show and are hysterical in every scene they were in. James Earl Jones obviously did his thing as Mufasa, and Chiwetel Ejiofor really brought a more terrifying dimension to Scar than the great Jeremy Irons.\n\nThe only real issues were with adult Simba and Nala who were played by Donald Glover and Beyonce (dont kill me Bey-Hive) respectively. They just did not bring the energy at all to their line readings and almost felt lifeless at times. Both sounded great singing but when they just had to talk to other characters they both felt out of place at times.\n\nMusic \u2013 B+ I mean its The Lion King. Elton John, Hakuna Matata you know all the songs and probably the lyrics to them. The only difference in this was they all were slightly a bit worse than the original movie, and without the magic and special effects in the animation, this loses some of the joy that made the '94 movie so special.\n\nStory \u2013 B Again it is The Lion King, the story is very similar to the original which is a story we have seen throughout history. I think again it is just hard sitting in the theatre knowing every scene that is going to happen. At least in Aladdin and Dumbo they made significant story and dialogue changes in order to update the story. This really was almost a shot for shot remake which obviously hurt the creativity of the overall project.\n\n*A couple other tidbits\n\n- The stampede in this movie looked eerily similar to the stampede in Jon Favreau's last Disney Reboot, The Jungle Book (Juice Rating: 88)\n\n- Shahadi Wright Joseph (Us) and JD McCrary (Little) were great as young Simba and Nala and made me really care for the characters all over again.\n\n- Again why are there only two males in the whole pride, Mufasa and Scar? \n\n- Is Nala Simba's Half Sister or Scar's Daughter?\n\n- Jon Favreau has been Disney's go to guy for over a decade now and he did it again with this one. Between Iron Man, Jungle Book, and this he has redefined movie making. This is all from the Middle Linebacker from The Replacements.\n\nYes in 2019 for me the Lion King still works, even if it is not quite as magical as the glorious original.\n\nJuice Rating:\n84/100",

What is so very disappointing about it is its lack of originality. It is essentially a shot by shot version of the animated film. Every shot, the music, the character vocal styles. There is nothing to set it apart. It is so unneeded. There is nothing to cause the audience to wonder about what will happen. I was even able to say the next line, since it is essentially the same script. Another problem is in the CGI animals. In the animated one, the characters were able to show various facial expressions and personality.  This time it is simply faceless, expressionless looking real-like animals with a voice over and a little mouth movement.  It's no better than \"Look Who's Talking\"! Still with the original for much for life.",

The beautiful visuals are perfectly complemented by Hans Zimmer's iconic score. I'm glad that they didn't do it exactly as a shot-for-shot remake, but I wouldn't have minded it either. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. The voice-cast were all good, especially the return of the James Earl Jones as Mufasa. Chiwetel Ejiofor gave an admirable performance as Scar, but in my opinion, Jeremy Irons is the real Scar and the film sorely lacked Jeremy's undeniably sarcastic tone. I always wanted Beyonce to voice Nala in a remake, and when she was announced as part of the cast, it was like it was meant to be, and she didn't disappoint. The Hyenas had their good moments, but they can't compare to the comedic gold of Shenzi, Banzai and Ed in the original film, these versions were far more sinister. Timon and Pumbaa, on the other hand, were brilliant. Sure nobody can replace Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella, but Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen's versions are a wonderful tribute. Seth's recognizable chuckle fits surprisingly well with Pumbaa's personality. The visuals are jaw-dropping, I don't even know whether to call this an animated film, as the visuals are hyper-realistic. A bit too realistic for the character's facial expressions, but when you're going for realism sacrifices have to be made. As for the \"shot-for-shot\" claim, the original film has far to many iconic moments that can't be ignored, both in cinematography and screenplay. The original film is one of the most quotable films of all time, plus the spectacular visual moments are just as unforgettable. Some people might call in unimaginative, but that's the point of a remake. You're reusing someone else's idea and giving it your own spin. Not staying faithful to the source material is like spitting on it's legacy. The original Lion King is up there as one of, if possibly not the greatest animated film of all time, and this film does a pretty good job at keeping it's predecessor's legacy intact. Plus, Sir Elton John, Tim Rice and Hans Zimmer's return to rework the score and music of the original film was the cherry on top.",

It was, however, scene-for-scene... and there's a difference. You could not lay this film on top of the original and get a single image, but the sequence of events was almost exactly the same. They did add a scene with the lionesses. The graphics were beautiful. I wasn't too perturbed by the voice acting and photo-realistic animals. But... I was a tiny bit bored. Most of the new jokes didn't land. Some of them did, but it wasn't enough to overcome the ennui. It wasn't the filmmakers' fault, though; it's just that I've already seen this story a million times.",

The Lion King is a one of a kind adventure and this reboot of a not so old film showcases what is wrong with modern blockbusters. This is a carbon copy with added depth that is not relevant. The original animated film was punchy and timeless, sadly the film is not. It will provide a night in for the family, but not the film it should of been. Why did they remake it scene for scene? Nuts. 20/10/2019",

The animation/cgi is stellar, very amazing, perhaps the best ive ever seen and thats why I give it such high rating. Other than that the original is much superior in every way. This movie is almost a scene for scene shot of the original but the dialogue and the voice actors lack passion and drama. The dialogue in pivotal moments that are key to emphasizing emotion in important scenes are changed, and not in a good way, it takes a lot of the power in key scenes out of the film. Powerful moments and statements made in the original are brushed over quickly in this one. It feels rushed, you don't get the same impact as the original which is very unfortunate because this movie is very beautifully done well. It is very beautiful to watch. They should've been kept the same delivery in dialogue if they were going to do a shot for shot remake. The voice actors aren't great either, it seems off. Their performances come off as very stale, like they are reading a book. No emotion is felt at all, seems very weird, throws you out of the movie. Music isn't great either, it doesn't hit at all, seems like they just put it in their for star power. Overall its a decent movie because of its fantastic animation, which is very unfortunate because this movie had A LOT of potential, it could have been really good but Favreau and the actors fail to create anything with substantial emotion. If the director and actors did as well as the CGI creators this movie would've been a tremendous hit, but instead it completely lacks the heart and is void of the spirit  that comes from the original.",

I feel like she ruined the film and also that actor or who played scar, I was gutted they didn't stick to the original storyline with the hyenas, the original was so much better. it was good, but not amazing. I didn't like the way he voiced scar, didn't even seem to go the same way or similar, he tried to make it his own and he didn't sing the original song. The film isn't one where you're thinking, \"oh my gosh, i love it, i want to see it again\" it's more, \"I hope Beyonc\u00e9 is definitely not in the The Lion King 2: Simba's Pride, the same goes with Donald Glover\" The original cast was perfect, the original Nala and scar. Did they even get asked to voice over their original characters in the live action one? The only thing I loved out of the whole entire movie, was Mufasa! Sarabi wasn't voiced by the original Woman, which is a shame. Pumba was perfect and Timon was sort of ok, but Pumba was better. I just hope that The Lion King 2 Simba's Pride is going to be without Beyonc\u00e9 and Donald Glover. they ruined the film!",

Disney and all other animation studios have done a tremendous job in refining even the finest details, down to the individual hairs on each animal. The casting was great to an extent.

I had the Lion King toys, soundtrack on casette tape, I had the Sega Megadrive game, the matching duvet and curtain set, and then when the VHS was released it must've been one of my most watched videos in my childhood home (until I discovered Star Wars - but that's another review for another time...).\n\nFast forward to 2019, Lion King is back, and finally I manage to get a night with my wife and we splashed out to watch this live action adaptation of one of our favourite Disney animated classics.\n\nWhy Disney?!?!?! Why did you feel that you had to sell out and dilute your beloved classic in such a poorly made film? \n\nDon't get me wrong, the visuals are stunning, and the VFX artists really deserve every bit of credit here because they made a visual masterpiece, but that's the only good thing going about this film.\nPoor voice acting - it hurts me to say this, but even James Earl Jones didn't seem to have any emotion is his voice at all, especially compared to when he played the same role 25 years ago and did it tremendously! The characters faces being true to their animal selves, could not reflect the varied emotions and feelings needed for the story, therefore a lot of the dialogue and songs seem to be slowed down to fit with the animals face. Doesn't really work though...\nAs well as this, the cast choice is poor (seems like they were only picking based on demographic, rather than talent...) the story is poorly adapted; it's overly rushed at some points, and then dragged out by a dung beetle at other moments - just to get the runtime up from 1h 29m to 1h 58m. \n\nI'm very disappointed by this movie, and will not watch again. In future I will be sticking to the animated classic!\n\nI was only going to give this one star, but upped it to two as a credit to the visual effects artists.",

The care and production level that went into this is evident from the first frames. The CGI is impeccable, the songs are done wonderfully (with one exception), and even the change-ups in voice-actor casting is for the most part incredible. I thought I'd hugely miss Jeremy Irons in the role of scar, but for this version I can honestly say that Chiwetel Ejiofor was the better choice; he nailed it. Plenty has been said that is positive about this rendition and I agree with nearly all of it. \nMy only two complaints are that A) Rafiki did not have as large of a role speaking-wise (and my favorite line from the original was missing: \"it doesn't matter - it's in the past!\"). Though I have to admit that he was still right on target and his laugh was perfection. And, B) a *far* larger complaint was how much Beyonce *ruined* \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" by over-singing it to a degree that surpassed annoying. Her other numbers were great and she can go all out, but when you're in a musical number that is a scene and character based you need to take some notes from musical theater actors and take it down to a grounded level. She was hitting grace notes up and down every single phrase and it was more than distracting; we all know she can sing well. There was no need to \"prove\" it in that scene. (And frankly, there are many better female actors of color that could have filled that role more appropriately, but it is what it is.)\nI've also heard talk that the animal weren't as facially expressive as in the original - this is true, but voice-acting was more nuanced and CGI animal emotions were more subtle which honestly worked incredibly well for me.\nAll in all, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this version and I don't consider it anything other than a near home-run.",

Jon Favreau is asking these BIG CATS to act, albeit CGI, but they just won't follow.\n\nThe directors clearly were conflicted about going for animal facial contortions to show emotions the way the original animated material did and excelled, or go for the hyper realistic CGI to showcase disneys cutting edge technology\n\nthey went for the latter... which was bad.. really really bad.\n\nvisually the animal characters are stunning - if you're watching animal planet.\n\nbut 10 minutes into the movie  when the characters started to speak, specifically Simba waking up Mufasa for an early morning road trip and shouting to his dad (...But YOUuuu promiiiiiised!!!) - you realize that something is already wrong with the story telling. You don't see a young cub throwing tantrums, excitement, and youthful glee all at the same time... and Mufasa the lion is bored with being voiced by JAmes Earl JOnes after 30 years (i mean cant they get a hotter actor more millenial one?).. you just see a bunch of CATS with dubbed audio, and somehow expect you to it work out which is which speaking at the moment. \nWith that single scene alone, you'll know the animated version is far superior than this one.\n\nSure they cgi'ed the animals mouth to mimic or sync speaking - but they already did that on the pig with \"THE BABE\". Michael J. Fox already did it years before with Homeward Bound  without any \"mouth animation\", but somehow it still worked.\n\nThis LION KING didnt.\n\nThey should have gone full \"remake\" by animating the facial expressions on those lions similar to the animated couterpart. Anyone argue it may be \"cartoonish\", well its a movie with talking lions so, cartoonish might be too simplistic a description for this kind of movie - but accurate.\n\nDraco the dragon in \"Dragonheart\" were cgi'ed with some goofy expresions to convey Sean Connery's expressions. Cartoonish? maybe, but it worked. The dragon was cheesy, it was funny, and brief moments of serious scenes, you also emphatize with the character. All along you know its a CGI. MAybe not oscar worthy, but any kid who'd seen that movie fell in love with that animated character.\n\nAll in all The Lion King is just an excellent CGI movie... with animals.\nAt least Michael Bays' cgi movies feature ROBOTS, and its more fun if you shut-off   your brain for a few hours.\n\n\n\n",

Overall, the performances were good: James Earl Jones, can't go wrong there; Donald Glover, excellent as expected.\n\nThe Bad - It's incredibly hard to get photo-realistic animals to emote. And it shows. As a \"by the numbers\" remake, it doesn't add anything. In fact, it takes away, given the lack of emoting from photo-realistic CGI animals. If you have nothing to add, you have no reason to exist.\n\nThe Ugly - Besides the opening \"Circle of Life\" song, each song is horribly preformed. Specifically \"Be Prepared\", one of the best of best musical numbers of the original, this overly shortened \"spoke/sung\" version, murdered any chance of me even considering watching this film a second time.",

This new Scar lost everything that made the Jeremy Irons Scar wonderful. That was his acid humor full of irony and sarcasm. In this new Scar we now just see a mean generic 'James Bond villain' in form of a lion.\nIt's a weak movie, that's very far from quality and emotion that we had on the original.

It makes me hope they do another project together someday.  I didn't like that Rafiki's role was reduced, he was my favorite character from the original. I didn't like Beyonc\u00e9 as the adult Nala, I felt like her vocal acting was terrible and didn't fit the character at all.

But, this movie is a copy and paste of the 1994 masterpiece minus all the emotion and soul that made it great. Don't get me wrong, it's visually stunning, and I thought the voice cast was great. But, if you're going to remake a movie into live action, or in this case, photorealistic action, utilize that. Make it your own. I mean, I can understand why Favreau did what he did, because we all know how fans get all bitchy and butthurt if the movie isn't what they want, but a lot of people, including myself, are bitching about it anyway. So, really, what was the point of this movie? Oh right... MONEY$$$$$!!! Disney knows that people will go and see these movies and make money off of them, and people need to realize that these remakes won't end if they keep this up. Alright, I'm done ranting.

Because James Earl Jones was great.)\n\nThe T+P new combo works and I actually really enjoyed the new Scar as he now seems like an actual villain.

The duet between Donald Glover's Simba and Beyonc\u00e9 Nala was my most anticipated part but unfortunately was disappointing due to the fact that Beyonc\u00e9's vocals drowned out Simbas which felt more like a Nala solo and less of a duet.

And to be honest, that makes me feel a little bit sad.\n\nBack to the film though, the story hits all the beats from the original, Scars betrayal of his brother, Simba growing up with Timon and Pumba, his eventual return. The songs are fun and again, the effects are very good. I honestly forgot at times that this is a CGI movie. It'll easily entertain the kids, but to be honest, I'd put the original on and give them some of the old Disney magic and imagination (that they nicked from Osamu Tezuka and Kimba, the White Lion, oooo, shots fired!).",

This is awesome...because hyenas are a matriarchal, female-dominated species in real life! Despite this, it seems the (supposed) inbreeding of Simba and Nala is something Disney has yet to set straight but I suppose that might be really difficult/pointless to do as so much of the storyline revolves around that romance and so many people seem to overlook this glitch. Scar appeared to be much darker, with clearer motivations, than in the original. I'm not sure if it's just me but he also comes across as more blatantly sociopathic.\n\nHowever, this is a very nostalgic movie for many people, and for that reason alone I doubt it'll live up to its reputation.",

Disney needs to understand that just because they remake a film that has appealed to us for years, it doesn't mean it helms the true emotion in what made the original amazing. Don't think that is the case? The 1994 original film struck us by the heart with its dazzling animation, great soundtrack and memorable moments. This 2019 remake was a legitimate copy and paste of the original (with a few new lines of dialgoue thrown in). Add in some mediocre CGI at times and you have the recipe for a terrible film. It's souless yet filled with nostalgia as it appeals to us who have watched the original in the time it came out. Do people like it? Of course, as its box office performance can attest to that. Do they need to see it? No. They would be better off enjoying the original and its true sentiments. I have no interest seeing this remake again, even if it's rich with nostalgia and has James Earl Jones as the only actor reprising his role from the original.",

I would too, ordinarily, but I was quite entertained and enthralled by Disney's remake of this classic. For one thing, the story material itself is so strong that any lack of originality in the story is actually welcome! With Hollywood's never ending obsession with SJW politics and inserting sexuality and profanity for it's own sake it is really nice that Jon Favreau decided NOT to \"update or improve\" the story! Also, having the great James Earl Jones return as Mustafa was a great choice. He, like his character has a very regal quality and timbre to his voice that is, for this roll, absolute perfection. (Although as a big Star Wars geek, I remember turning to my wife during his first encounter with Scar and asking snarkily why he just doesn't Force choke him!) Dominall Gleeson and Beyonce are also wonderful and Chiwetel Ejiofor's turn as Scar is as magnificently conniving and chillingly evil as one could expect. The movie is visually stunning and should look even more breathtakingly beautiful when it ones out on Disney+ with a good HDR 4K television. So, especially if you haven't seen the original, see this one on a big screen with Dolby Atmos, and then watch the original at home for kicks. This movie is fine for kids 8 years old to 80, enjoy",

If you're going to remake a classic movie, you have to give it something different, something that makes us feel like it was worth doing, and because the 1994 original was essentially a perfect movie to begin with, this remake just seemed kind of pointless. Yes it is visually absolutely stunning, and it's a real nostalgia trip, but the soundtrack just left me wanting a little, and personally I would rather just watch the animated classic as I have many times over.",

They added some new scenes that I liked a lot and made it a little more fun. I was impressed to see the animals that looked real, it was a great job they did. The animated film is my favorite of Disney and I looked forward to this live action and I was fascinated by the cinema, because it met my expectations. Beautiful and very well adapted. One of the best movies of this year.",

            "content": "Do you remember The Polar Express with Tom Hanks voicing a conductor on a fantasy train?  Do you remember why the movie flopped?  One reason was that the animation was too life-like.  Humans don't like animations to look too real because it gives us the creeps.\nLion King 2019 fails in many ways and unfortunately its greatest achievement, the near-to-life rendering of the characters is also one of its biggest downfalls.  Having an almost real animal talk and show human emotions just looks wrong.  In the original animated movie, because of relatively simple animation, the audience could suspend their disbelief and could accept the personification, but the 2019 movie is just plain creepy.  It would be like remaking the original Mickey Mouse movies using a real mouse.\n\nMoving on, I have to ask the question \"Why was the movie made?\" The original was tight, fast paced and above all it was funny.  The interplay between Timon and Pumba is legendary. In the 2019 version, not so much. It is as if Disney wanted to explain the jokes of the original, and those that they couldn't explain they just left out.  One of my favourite lines from Timon was when they introduced Simba to their diet.  \"Let's rustle up some grub.\" (digs in a log) \"Aha! a grub!\".   Short, sharp and funny.  In 2019 the line is missing.  Instead the forest animals point out the different types of grubs. The Lion King just went from comedy to documentary.\n\nMy kids grew up on the Lion King (on VHS), so much so that I knew the first 10 minutes of script out of my head. They loved the animation, I loved the jokes.  I am interested to see who this 2019 version was aimed at.\n\nSorry Disney.  Well done on the real life animation, but if you want to make dark Shakespearian movies, please don't rehash an old favourite.  ",

On top of that the saturation in this film is pretty low, giving it a dull and boring look that is nowhere near as gorgeous as The Jungle Book remake. A remake is supposed to add and fix things that need fixing in the original, be different and stand out on it's own but this just took away. Now I am not saying that it should be like the Little Mermaid Remake from 2018 or like the maleficent movie, but I am saying that when you are going to remake a beloved classic that we have already seen before, add more heart and depth into the characters (especially when all the characters are emotionless cgi animals). They even make the Mufasa Death scene somehow funny and it sound bad to say but it was probably the most funny part of the whole entire film. It was funny because of the bad CGI in that specific scene, weird directing, camera movements and voice acting and because there is absolutely no depth or weight in that scene. I could go on but I will just stop ranting and finish this with one message; People, for Pete's sake, stop giving Disney YOUR money from YOUR pocket every time they make a remake (more like a cash grab then an actual remake).",

            "content": "\"The Lion King\" was a very problematic film, even in its 1994 cartoon. Fascist perceptions of power adoration, conservative mortality, patriarchal nurturing, focusing on the world of males - all did not stop him from becoming one of Disney Studios' favorite works.\nNow, in his photo-realistic version, another problem emerged: not only could the images seem cruel and direct to the young audience, but the human dimension that accompanied the savannah animals in the original film was gone. Think of a pumba that is nothing more than a talking warthog, with no real personality, in Seth Rogen's vital speech that only highlights the limited scope of the photo-realistic facial expressions.\nThe \"Lion King\" model of 2019 is nothing more than an impressive technological vision. And yes, another way to enrich the cashier of Disney Studios. Why think of something new, if you can just do a cover version of the old one? None of the new releases Disney has created so far will become a classic that will accompany children and their parents into the future. Maximum, in 25 years they will produce a new film that will use future technology. Maybe by then they will also be able to engineer emotion.\nOne cannot help but be impressed by the technological achievements of \"The Lion King,\" and in this respect director John Favreau transcends the visuals offered by his previous Disney adaptation, \"The Jungle Book\" (2016). At the same time, it is precisely the realistic images that are damaging to what worked well in the previous film - the songs. Digital animals look very unconvincing as they begin to sing and move in rhythm, and if \"The Jungle Book\" Favreau gave up all but one of the songs - it seemed possible and desirable here too. \"The Hakone Hookah\" would have worked better as a whistle in the background, and not like the lumbering and magic processing of the current version, which evokes any trace of the animation's original and expressive possibilities. It is enough to see the differences between the two versions to understand.\nThe film's technological achievements do indeed make us feel like we're in a real jungle. But digital breakthrough enthusiasm does not come at the expense of emotion and soul. This is more of a rehearsal than an attempt to recreate the film (as Julie Taimor did in her successful stage-musical adaptation). Another victim is Zazu, the goofy chicken (Light Knight host John Oliver), who has trouble delivering comic merchandise with a limited range of expressions stemming from realistic animation. At least flying is successful.\nThe main question that arises in view of \"The Lion King\" is: Why, exactly? After all, it's not exactly a remake, nor an adaptation that offers a reinterpretation of the movie, which was Disney's first based on an original story. The feeling that accompanies us throughout the watching is of blatant exploitation. This is a film that does not come to resume but to squeeze. Its purpose is not to breathe life (something the original movie doesn't need anyway), but to declare: \"Look at me!\" The lions, hyenas, warthog, and Suricata are therefore more reminiscent of Dr. Frankenstein's creature than real animals.",

This remake brings its own the heart, energy, soul, and emotions of the realism of wildlife in Africa with the same story we know and love. Something we all take for granted, that needs to be appreciated in this film as 1000s of species are going extinct every year. That's the circle of life Jon Favreau wanted us to really think about while watching the remake. Real animals are a part of our lives, in the animal kingdom they too have stories to tell. That they also can in body human souls, emotions, grief, heart, tragedy, and triumph even if we can't see it the same way.      \n\n\n\n\n Lion King 2019: 90/100 A-",

When you don't look at the screen and hear voice-actors, you can compare pictures from the original movie and remake in your mind and it works, but if you look at the screen there is dissonance- dools without any emotion and people behind the scene, who try to put some humanity in picture and it looks very weird. Artificially strached useless scenes, like the scene with mouse at the beginning, which provided just to show us how good the modern technologies and CGI and where budget money have been provided. So, according to all this fact i can make a conclusion that film was maded only for getting money from generation who has grew up on Disney's original The Lion King story. Disney made money from our nostalgia, memories about our childhood and didn't do anything to make this remake at least at the same level with original movie.",

This may have been in part due to the lack of facial expression on the part of most of the characters.\n\nIt did not have a great balance between keeping true to the old story and making this one it's own. Aladdin struck that balance well, this one did not.\n\nI feel no need to watch this movie again...ever. I'll stick with the original.",

There are legitimate moments where I would believe that these are real animals in the wild; they look,act and sound like their realistic counterparts. It's a beautiful movie to watch.\n\nThe humor,when it's there,is incredible. I am,of course, referring to Timon and Pumba. I have no idea how they performed in the original,but I'm sold on a Lion King 1.5 sequel. They share genuine banter, which really lighten the tone of the film.\n\nIn terms of negatives, you've probably already heard,but the film is pretty bland. The lions have no real emotion, nor are they allowed to,cause it would be hard to animate. In that sense,this comes off as a nature documentary, with A-list actors performing mediocre dubs. I don't even blame the actors,it's just that since the animation is so real, the emotions couldn't be. Speaking of which, there's also a weird disconnect between scenes that are clearly meant to be brutal (the stampede, the final fight),but are toned down to PG13 . It takes you slightly off rhythm, because you want it to be real,but you know Disney won't show you the blood and gore.\n\nAll in all, I'd say this film works best as a chapter in a photorealism course for budding visual effects artists. I enjoyed it (having nothing to compare to), but if anything, it's gotten me excited to see the original,as well as the Broadway play. I know there's better versions out there, so I'm comfortable not thinking too much about this one.",

Not a big deal, however if the point was to make it more realistic, it would have been better to go with someone with a stronger African accent.\n\nOver all, a very good film.",

Photorealism is simply not, the range of expression can't compete with animation.

Doesnt really impress or entertain but pull on the idea of just using technology to make some extra money. This was that case.

(I would've just watched Lion King (original) if it was basically going to be the same dialect. ) Also the voices could have been better. (Maybe not the voices, but the voice directing) The characters sound as though they just went through the script once and the director just went with the first take. And the Simba (kid VO) just seemed like he was trying to hard to sound like Simba and wasn't trying to act like him.(He had a good voice I just think the director could have helped him understand Simba's character a bit more so his voice would be convincing to the audience).

Seriously, its an achievement in itself.  And seeing the animals express themselves with physical body language hit me harder than the animated version.\n\nAnd yet its true what you've heard - the photorealism does take away much of the energy and magic that was present in the animated version.  The animals can't emote much, and many, if not all, of the musical sequences fall flat.\n\nScar as a whole is terrible - they made an artistic choice to portray him as somewhat mangy and sickly looking, which does not make for an intimidating villain.  And his iconic \"Be Prepared\" sequence is only memorable for how flat and terrible it was.\n\nIf you're interested in seeing an achievement in animation technology, give this a shot, but otherwise I can't recommend it.  The original is infinitely better, and this version is more of an experimental experience than a true classic.",

The songs were either not trying at all (Be Prepared I'm looking at you) or mismatched vocalists (Can You Feel The Love Tonight) or mismatched visuals (I Just Can't Wait To Be King and Can You Feel The Love TONIGHT). \n\nWhat should have been a really powerful scene was almost comedic when when Scar asks Adult Simba who was to blame for Mufasa's death and Simba quickly mumbles \"it was me.\" Even Mufasa's lines weren't delivered as well as the animated version and IT WAS THE SAME GUY.

And in case you haven't watched the original, the plot is about Simba, a lion prince, after his father's death takes an adventure, and during this adventure he finds out that there's more in life than what he expected.\n\nThe original Lion King movie is my favorite animated movie of all time, and it's in my top 3 movies of all time too, I think it's a masterpiece in every way possible, so I was super-excited to see how could they turn that masterpiece into a Live-Action remake, and I find it a little bit weird to call it \"Live-Action\", because technically, it's animated but in a very realistic way! We'll get to that point later.\nI was also afraid, because The Lion King is so close to my heart, I grew up watching it, so I was afraid to see this movie fail or something, but fortunately it didn't!\n\nThe Lion King has an impressive visual effects, it never felt CGI-ed or anything, it was so real, the details were very impressive, I like that very much, because the original was richly drawn with amazing colors, it's the best 2D animated movie ever made, and it was revolutionary, so it's good to see the Live-Action remake revolutionary too! But as it was impressive and pleasant to the eyes, it was also emotionless! That's my biggese with this movie, that there's no emotion is this movie, every scene it's just lions moving their mouths and words coming out, or just animals doing stuff, you never get attached to them the same way you did in the original, because in the original you saw them smile, cry, laugh.. you saw their emotions, and that touched us so deep sometimes, but in this movie, it wasn't even near to the original.\n\nThe movie was also shot-by-shot a remake, for some that could be a huge problem, for me that all I wanted to see from this movie, I didn't expect anything more, though the movie adds 30 minutes, it didn't add enough to the story, it's just the plot of the original, and I'm okay with that, even the soundtrack was almost the same, same songs -only one new-, same OST by the same composer, so technically, they didn't do anything creative, or more than what they did back in 1994. It was all about nostalgia, to feel nostalgic to your childhood, and it did that perfectly, but there's no point to make this move, except for making somethings more clearer than the original, more animals talking, because that was weird to see only the main characters talking in the original, things that can make more sense than the original.. and money!\n\nThe casting choices are amazing, everyone made a great job, to see James Earl Jones back as Mufasa, it added something more to the movie, Donald Glover was amazing as Simba, JD McCrary as young Simba too.. Seth Rogen as Pumba was magnificent, unfortunately, there's a so little of him in that movie, Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar was the MVP of this movie, though he wasn't that great as Jeremy Irons, but he was so good as a villain! Billy Eichner as Timon is the worst, he didn't add anything to his character, and he was so emotionless, he wasn't that funny, even though, Timon was the hilarious part of the original, but Billy Eichner didn't do it right!\n\nThe movie has 30 min more, and -as I said- they made added more sense sometimes, but sometimes they added scenes just to make it to almost 2 hours, and they even deleted some scenes of Rafiki, there were so little of him in this movie! The original has a great scene between Simba and Rafiki, and it's not in this one anymore.\n\nThe Lion King gave justice to the original, though it did lack of emotions, and added some unnecessary scenes, and deleted an important scene, some of the changes were welcome, some not very, but still it was very good to see a great Live-Action remake from Disney again!\n\nI'm gonna give The Lion King an A-!\n\nThank you guys, for reading another review of mine, if you liked this, click on my name up above and see all my reviews, look forward to my review of the original Lion King. Thanks again!",

You will notice the difference in personalities and characteristics of the characters. They had no attempts of trying to preserves the original nature of the classic characters. The staple of this movie is two things, it\u2019s music and it\u2019s drama. First, the singing was very difficult just to like, not even love. Second, the drama was completely taken out of the movie from the cinematic and animations to the voiceovers. The new dialogue wasn\u2019t good and to top it off some character sound like they were reading off the script. It equaled a lifeless performance. The only thing in this movie that was honestly great was the instrumentals. I could continue further into my review, but I think the point is clear. If I had never seen the original, this movie would leave me wonder if there was an original movie. Overall it was flat, mostly boring. A Tuesday movie at best, I give it a D -",

While it can take pride in its graphics and looks, the film overall loses me within several things that are crucial to the Lion King.  \n\n  Firstly, the voice acting. For the most part, the voice acting in the film sounds unnatural and like they were purely reading from a script.  Some of the highlighted talent in the film would have to be Seth Rogen (Pumba), Billy Eicher (Timon), and JD McCary (Young Simba) and the rest of the Hyena trio. James Earl Jones was okay but didn't surprise me at all with his performance. However, the voice of Scar, Chiwetel Ejiofor, is exceptionally good. \n\n  Secondly, the lack of emotions on pretty much every character. One of the many things that the animated '94 film got away with was the emotions. It was animated so biology never really played a factor. Due to the realism of the film, the dance sequences/songs, and many of the character development scenes felt flat and bland. While I enjoyed the dance sequences it just felt bland at the same time. Specifically the I Can't-Wait to be King scene fell far down due to realism.  I was seriously and mentally preparing myself for the death of Mufasa and sadly while it was still sad and the same besides one iconic shot being change, the entire sequence felt emotionless and nearly didn't affect as much as it did back in 1994. \n\n  In conclusion, I enjoyed The Lion King for what it was. It was a bland re-telling of the beloved classic. While I loved some changes added to Nala's character and the epic fight sequence, the film overall fell flat for me. \n\nThe Lion King gets a C. ",

I have had a peek into the process and know it took a MONSTROUS amount of work to create the characters. You could see the muscles and even the veins!! They did an AMAZING job creating the world and it's animals in this movie.\n\n\ud83d\ude21However, I've got a lot of beef with this movie. It was like a delicious looking cake that had no flavor and no ice cream on the side. This is Disney, and I want my side of fucking ice cream.\n.\n1) Character design: It looked fantastic and super realistic, but that's the problem right there; It looked SOOOO realistic, that the expressions on the characters were nearly non existent. It is possible to create this kind of realism, but still have enough imaginative unrealistic designs that wont clash. Look at Smaug and how Bennedict played that character; it looked real, and the performance is fucking GREAT. Just go look up the youtube vid of him in the motion capture suit.  Without good BODY LANGUAGE AND FACIAL EXPRESSIONS, you could easily tell it was just actors standing in front of a mic and not throwing themselves into the role. \n\n2) Voice Actors: They were also flat as fuck. I was hyped about the cast, so this was really disappointing. The inflections on the lines just didnt come off of the screen. It sounded like all the animals were shitty high school kids that happened to have nice singing voices do their first Lion King play 1 week after getting the script. I was looking forward to that moment where Scar warns Mufasa not to turn his back on him and suddenly Mufasa has this THREATENING voice saying \"Is that a challenge?!\". That moment came on screen and I was bored (seriously, look at the original). No emotional content. The voice directing was trash.\n\n1+2=3) With one and two combined, it's just crap. Emotionless crap. I didnt feel Simba's pain or fear when his father died, and I wanted to. When you have super realistic animals, you dont get facial expressions. Combine that with weak voice inflections and I felt nothing. No pauses or moments where you could feel tension or any sort of movement of emotion.\n\n4) Carbon Copy: I KNOW it is a remake, but I feel like they majorly missed an opportunity. They should have dropped every damn song but Hakuna Matata and made more time for character development. I cant believe Scar breaking into song looking like that. \n\nWhat do I mean by character development? I LOVE DC's animated movies. Under the Red Hood is fucking dope. However, if you copy that exactly into a live action movie, the characters will likely seem a bit flat. I think when you bring more realism to the screen, you have to care more about your characters. I dont fully know how to explain it. More story to support a character's emotional journey is needed the closer it gets to reality I think. Drop the songs and add more scenes or dialogue along those lines and MAYBE I would have felt it more. \n\nThe battle for pride rock mostly sucked. Why copy? You have so much to build on!! What if Scar had a small army of animals that were \"protected\" going up against Simba and his rebels at the end? What if it was closer to a war? Just a thought...\n\n5) The story boarding was trash. Too much lifted from the original. If you cant use facial expressions, then you need to pick your shots and place your figures (i forget the term for that) better to make the audience feel certain emotions. \nOk, there have been worse, but again...with all this technology, your visual storytelling should have been much better. \n\nThe movie looks fantastic, but I wanted to walk out. I stayed hoping that the final battle or Childish Gambino would rock it. Nope. The original Lion King movie better. \n\nAnyways, rant over. I should have made a youtube vid out of this.",

The voice actors did a good job but not great. The originals did a much better job of selling their personalities as animals where this version failed to suspend the disbelief. Many of the moments felt like a person singing the songs rather than the actual characters. It also seemed like they changed each song slightly to fit the voice actors strengths rather than casting someone that could pull off the original ensembles. Overall it was a good watch because it was just visually breathtaking, but as whole this really falls flat considering the high hopes and expectations set for such a classic and nostalgic movie. ",

I also am annoyed with all of these remakes, but let me tell you, this movie was exceptional. The casting was brilliant, Seth Rogan and Billy Eichner as Pumbaa and Timon, absolutely stole the show. That being said, this movie is definitely not as appropriate for a younger crowd like the original cartoon. The CGI is the most realistic that Ive ever seen, and the drama and emotion is unreal. 10/10 go see it, but maybe leave your 4-year-old at home!",

My girlfriend and I left shortly after the gorge scene because we could not stand this film.  \n\nMy single most significant criticism for the film is that all of the acting that we saw up to that point felt utterly phoned in from the start of the film.  Even Jame Earl Jones, who I love sounded like he was cold reading lines.  Every single actor felt like they were reading lines on a page with total indifference.  There was no sense of urgency or any emotion at all with the characters.\n\nThe significant scenes leading up to the gorge scene felt eviscerated of meaning due to this fact \u2014 scenes like when Mufasa is scolding Simba after saving them from the hyenas.  Mufasa did not have emotion in his voice at all.  Worse yet during the gorge scene Scar saying his famous line, and Mufasa falling to his death, again wholly flat. \n\nUpon walking out on the film, we immediately went and picked up a copy of the original movie and noticed a very significant difference, especially with James Earl Jones' Mufasa.  Every character felt alive and emotionally grounding, whereas the CGI film just felt flat and did not try to immerse you.\n \nThe film felt like a cash grab with big list actors to try and draw in crowds who were excited based on their memories from the original.  I was one of them.  Immediately from the start, this film felt off and continued to get worse as it progressed.  I have never in my life felt compelled to leave a theater until seeing this film.   ",

It uses\nthe photorealistic computer-animation technique to create animals. The 1994's version is\none of the best movies of all time. So does this movie lives up to all hype? Definitely.\nAll animals look so realistic that you can't differentiate between them and those in\nNational Geographic's documentary. It is visually stunning. But at the same time, this is\none of the limitations of the movie too. Since all animals look real, it limits the ability to\nshow expression like in animation one can show shocking expression by very big eyes,\nwhich will look little awkward if they try that in live-action. The movie keeps zoological\nauthenticity.\nIt would be a little injustice to the movie if we compare it with 1994's version as\nchildhood memories are always sweeter and this is the reason the older one will always\nbe better than the later one.\nAs an individual, I really enjoyed the movie. The lovely Father-Son relation, their\nbonding, Mufasa's philosophy and lessons to Simba are still very effective. One can\neasily connect with them. When Simba puts his paw on the impression of his Father's\npaw, the scene is literally heart touching.\nSeth Rogen and Billy Eichner are delightful as Pumbaa and his best friend Timon. Both\ncharacters entertain people a lot. They teach Simba a new philosophy \"Hakuna Matata\"\nwhich was opposite of Mufasa's Philosophy.\nThere is a lot to learn from The Lion King. The movie teaches so many lessons of life and\nperfectly depicts human nature with the help of animals.",

It seems like, because the main focus of this film was for the CGI to be breathtaking, that there wasn't enough attention to other important factors when it comes to creating movies. Timing, improvisation, and being more careful with details doesn't seem to have been on their minds. l did enjoy this movie, but when it's clear that so much could have easily been corrected to make the film better, it's disappointing.

Also, the theater sound was horrible, the voices were to the left, the music to the right, the WHOLE experience was just totally disappointing. Disney is not doing very good quality control and it shows. The CGI was amazing, but you didn't have the right voices for the characters, especially SCAR, it was just terrible.

The only reason I brought this up is because - how in the world are you going to make a live-action film that's most obviously not live-action? Stop grabbing people's money with cheap tricks. Get CGI to where I can't tell a difference at all before you start calling CGI films, live-action films. Duh. \n\nEverything else was pretty much regular Lion King, although I really did enjoy some of the human-like expressive behavior coming from mostly Zazu. The bird's natural fast-twitch muscle behavior along with the expressive voice and synced-up beak, really did sort of make me think there was some sort of talking bird in the midst of us.",

NOW Simbas hair lands on a leaf  and is eaten by a Giraffe and then it poops it out and a dung beetle rolls it to Rafiki and it breaks , but why was Rafiki looking at poop . Do you remember that scene where Rafiki  hits Simba on his heas and says that it doesnt matter because it is in the past that is GONE all GONE , but why it was the a moral of the story . Jon favreau   has made alot better the jungle book ( 2016 ) Iron Man and more this is easily the worst movie from him yet this guy helped make ENDGAME ...  ENDGAME  the actors who I will address are Beyonce and Seth Rogen . It felt like beyonce did not try at all but thrived in the scenes where she sang but it is the opposite for Seth Rogen he was an amazing actor but not a good singer . the last thing I will say is the jokes were funny especially the thats local were is it from right there joke .It was flawed but undeserving of the criticisms it is getting I would recommend  it best to watch with family .

The imagery throughout was so beautiful as well. My only real critique is that I thought a few of the voices didn't seem like the right fit, like Nala's, which didn't sound at all like the soft, sweet original voice, for example, and a couple of others.

I think Jon Favreau is a creative genius in his visionary take on projects. Unfortunately Disney got the Lion King right the first time, which didn\u2019t necessitate a remake. Which is why 90% of the original had been untouched for the 2019 version. HOWEVER... I think Favreau\u2019s brilliance will really come through if they get him to make a Lion King 2. The original is impossible to beat. But the sequels and spinoffs are much less memorable for MOST fans, yet still provide an excellent foundation for someone like Favreau to take it and really make it something special. Just like he did with Jungle Book. Jungle Book had plenty of room for creative reimagining because it\u2019s not as widely memorable, which is where he could take liberties that he simply didn\u2019t have with Lion King. I honestly think that the remake we got is by far the best possible job any director could\u2019ve done with the scope of the task at hand. Excellent work and it deserves every dollar and accolade that it\u2019s earning as we speak!! TWO THUMBS WAY UP!!!!",

Hyenas are generally tan or grey. Not black. You could blame it on the lighting but the hyena was black.\n\nIn fact, it appears that the mean hyena was crafted to emulate a black person. Furthermore, its voice over sounded like a black man. \n\nOf course the little children in the audience had no clue they were being brainwashed.\n\nLion King storyline attempted the proverbial Joseph Campbell mono-myth dramatic curve.  They even had the cleansing rain at the end but it was no help to improve the  distasteful bathroom humor.\nLion King failed to sustain the tit-for-tat excitement of Disney yesteryears movies. \n\nA shameless, shamefull racial movie.",

The film was directed by Jon Favreau, and stars Donald Glover as Simba and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar.\n\nThe film in my opinion is a disgrace to the original film, from the emotionless character expressions to the dreadful and unfitting voice acting.\n\nThe story was basically the same as the original (nearly down to the beat), but for some reason it felt a lot less epic and not nearly as intriguing or emotional.\n\nThe voice acting I found to be stale and dry, from the lack of care in the actors voices to the bland and weary line delivery; one voice actor in particular was Shahadi Wright Joseph as (child) Simba, I found that the performance he gave was really lacking in key areas like emotion and timing.\n\nThe characters were basically just the same as the original, so I don't really have much to say here.\n\nThe animation may be extremely realistic and detailed, but what angers me most is that because of the realism the animals and characters couldn't express as much emotion as they did in the original film.\n\nThe colour scheme was also very dark and grey, which in my opinion takes away from the atmosphere and scale of the film.\n\nThe soundtrack was also a huge let down from the original film, from Beyonc\u00e9 and Donald Glover's version of Can You Feel the Love Tonight (which takes place in the day) to the addition of Beyonc\u00e9's song Spirit.\n\nThe emotion and relationships in the film were also a lot less gripping, especially the relationship between Simba and Mufasa.\n\nThe film I also found to be really bland and uninteresting, but what makes it worse is that the original film was really interesting and had a very strong style to it.\n\nOver all I give it a \n1/10 - would never recommend\n\nA shallow and heartless product which should have never been made.",

I also realized they did this for the live action purpose, but I disliked the removal of some iconic scenes and actions from specific characters. Some parts from the 1st movie really added depth to characters and helped the audience really laugh or feel the intensity of a characters thoughts, ideas, plans. Again I know they removed a chunk of these things for live action purposes to fit in with realistic actions, but its hard not to mention either.

A lot of the voice acting felt like I was watching a community theatre play, which is sad because I really like a lot of the voice actors in this movie. While the animation is great and looks realistic, I think it takes away from the performance because the animals aren't allowed to show much emotion. The story in this one felt very rushed and they added some pretty pointless scenes. It feels very lacking and doesn't have near as much heart as the original.",

My son and I had both heard not-so-great reviews, so we were on the lookout for negatives but neither of us walked away with any negatives to talk about.

I think the best improvement though is the hyenas are given more of a menacing role than the joke that they were in the original.

With them restricted to hyper realism, there was a distinct lack of emotional connection, so Simba looking terrified, sad or overjoyed all looked the same, and often took me out of the moment. Even more confusing was the fact that real animals tend to show a broader range on facial expressions and emotions than what was presented on screen with the CGI versions. Some of the songs also had to be heavily restrained due to hyper-realistic restrictions, such as Scars \"Be Prepared\" song. There were some alterations from the original which were understandable but kind of took the magic out of the film for me. Also, Pumbaa changing species to a baby bush pig in his flashback was a bit confusing, baby warthogs look like mini versions of their adult counterparts, not like baby bush pigs!\n\nThe effects were superb but wasn't enough to cover the faults of the film for me.",

The scenery was lush and beautiful for the most part, I found the main characters heartwarming, and the interplay between Simba and his father both loving and stern when he explained the dangers when he disobeyed him were convincing for me.  Of course the comic moments were truly scene stealing. I washappen to hear James Earl Jones as Mufasah and there were mystic qualities with Rafeki, The death of Mufasah was was much more dramatic and darker than the original which I naturally expected and I will admit it, I cried!!! I really enjoyed it and was happy I didn't listen to critics and saw it for myself! I am glad they just rehash the story, but change little things here and there in the approach to the story line which made it fresh. Definitely a Must See!!!!",

They manage to get the lions and hyenas to show a lot more than others.\nShouldn't really need to talk about the story not much change in it \nI would say this movie wasn't the greatest but there wasn't anything bad in it it was a lot more in the middle for me. It isn't a second watch  for me anytime soon but enjoyable I would say  \n",

Donald Glover was great, James Earl Jones is great as we can expect, but I felt Ejiofor, while an incredible actor I've loved in other flicks, didn't have the level of menace Scar held in the original.  This being said, I think the change to Be Prepared, being made like a pre-battle speech for war was genius and Ejiofor NAILS that particular part.  The additional characters for Simba's time growing up with Timon and Pumba felt unnecessary, and some of the changes to Rafiki's part before Simba sees \"who he is\" felt less engaging than the animated original - but honestly all of this is nit-picking.  I enjoy the film and it felt worth the price of admission.",

Additionally the CGI made for fantastic models of animals but failed in giving them facial expressions.  This seemed to make the events of the film (which we're all familiar with) feel like they had less of an impact on the characters.  Overall it was still true to the lion king original in its writing and direction, but felt a little uninspired.

The voice acting was bland, dry, and did not make up for the lack of emotion realistic characters needed. I would take the original voice acting, put it over top since its almost scene for scene, and cut out the unnecessary bits (Like Scar basically becoming an incel because Sarabi chose Mufasa over him) And you would have a perfect, photo-realistic carbon copy. \n\nThis truly lacked the depth and emotion the original had, and I blame it all on the lack of emotion in these characters voices; (Even James Earl's voice lacked the depth he had in the original.)

The king and queen just brought in their newest baby, Simba.\n\tBut their brother (or brother in law),Scar (with a name like that, how can he NOT be evil?), schemes to get the throne.  Using the help of the hyenas, he gets the kign killed and Simba ousted out of the kingdom.\n\tBut the lion cub gets some help from a warthog and a meerkat, then the spirit of his dead father, then his \"friend\", Nala.\n\nSCORING\n\tMain Characters\n\tThe main characters most of us know and love are here and they are just as good and we remember them.  SCORE: 9\n\n\tSupporting Cast\n\tThey give Nala a bit more personality because, well, she's the leading lady.  Still, we get some good moments from a baboon, a bird and the hyenas themselves.  SCORE: 8\n\n\tPlot\n\tThe plot is easy to follow, and it has a few nice twists.  But they add a few new scenes that felt more like padding.  SCORE: 6\n\n\tOriginality\n\tThis particular Disney remake does the least changes to the animated version \u2013 which makes me wonder why make the live action in the first place (other than to show off some impressive CGI.  SCORE: 3\n\n\tViolence Factor\n\tThere's a lot of fights between lions and hyenas (I thought I was watching a nature documentary during those fights).  But the fights do get a tiring.  SCORE: 7\n\n\tOther Moral Issues\n\tThis film does a great job of showing how to take responsibility for your actions and how to overcome obstacles and situations.  But it does go overboard with the girl empowerment bit.  SCORE: 8\n\n\tFinal Score (out of 60): 41\t\t% Score: 68.33%\n\tIt's a good film \u2013 if you haven't seen the animated version.  But it doesn't do much to make it stand apart from that version. \t",

            "content": "Found this computer-generated remake to be an entertaining on the whole with a few caveats.\n\nThe movie looks so amazing and photo-realistic. The background in particular is really impressive, I'm surprised this film had only one real setting shot. You really can't tell the difference between this landscape and the real world. Director John Favreau (Iron Man; Jungle Book) has some interesting shots in this. At times, the movie feels like a nature documentary.\n\nPlotwise, this is probably the least ambitious of the recent Disney remakes. Unlike Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, which clung to the plot structure of the originals but also added new elements, this one just retells the basic story. Still, I'm not hating it. This isn't the 90's Psycho. It's not word-by-word. What works for me here is that the jokes are almost all new and they work really well.\n\nCast is decent. All the funny characters jive. Donald Glover as adult Simba and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar do a good job as the hero and villain. However, Beyonce as adult Nala sometimes really comes across as reading off the page without a whole lot of effort.\n\nThe background music really sells the scenes, but admittedly Hans Zimmer basically just rehashes the music from the first film.\n\nThis contains all the classic songs from the original. However, \"Be Prepared\" has been changed to a half-it's-length spoken word song with reworked lyrics. I know at one point the news was that they were cutting this song. (Either for time or Ejiofor just didn't have the pipes.) I'm guessing this was added back due to the backlash but modified to accomodate either or both of the potential issues just mentioned. I actually would've preferred if they left the song out rather than going with this neutered version, which doesn't quite work.\n\nIf you feel that the recent Disney remakes are soulless cashgrabs, this really won't be the one to change your mind. Despite coasting with the story, I personally found this to be engaging.",

What can I say about this movie other than it was super incredibly disappointing. More disappointing than any remake of anything in recent memory. \n\nHere's what is great. The casting was suuuuuuuuuper fantastic. Everyone sounded like the original cast. Whether that is intentional or just a happy circumstance, I don't care. Well done. Visuals? Impressive as ever. It looked how I imagine the Serengeti would look. Music? Also, well done. Very well done. With the exception of 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight?' We get it Beyonce. You have some pipes. You're still trash and I don't care what anyone says. Your music sucks and you almost destroy a song because you clearly want people to know you're a singer. FUCK OFF!\n\nAll right. Now that I've got the great stuff out of the way you're probably thinking I had a typo when I said it was disappointing. I didn't. Despite all of those things, it was missing the most important piece of what made this movie such a classic...EMOTION! There was no emotion displayed from any of these creatures during any given moment. The quintessential scene of Simba trying to get his dead father up should've gotten me, a 30 year old man, to bawl my eyes out on my tears. Not. One. Shred. Of. Sadness. The cartoon makes me misty eyed to this day. That's not a lie. This hyper realism should've done that and more. It didn't. \n\nAlso, there were changes with certain scenes' dialogue that should never have been changed. The scene of Simba speaking to the spectre of Mufasa. Such a POWERFUL scene in the cartoon. Mufasa tells his son that he has lost himself. Moreover, because he lost himself he had therefore forgotten about his father, whom he (Simba) claims to love. It was a powerful scene that really enlightened Simba to the realization of the consequences of him trying to hide from what has happened and to hide from who really is. What did the remake do? Tell Simba that he needed to reclaim his place on the throne so he can reclaim his place in the Circle of Life. While not terrible, IT MISSES THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF CHARACTERIZATION FOR SIMBA. \n\nJon Favreau is undoubtedly talented. I love Iron Man 1 obviously. The Jungle Book remake was perfect. While certain things were changed, they were changed well. THe Lion King is not an example of this. I had no emotional connection to ANY of these characters. I should have come out of this movie on CLOUD FUCKING 9 because of how much this movie means to me. Both, with the joy it brought to me as a youth and with an appreciation of the story being told when I reached adulthood. It saddens me. The cartoon is the best way to see this movie, undoubtedly. You can see the emotion of all the characters. The joy, the sadness, the disdain, the anger, everything. You don't get this with the remake. 1.75/5. I am truly sad to say this :(",

Instead, I felt like she was determined for her voice to be the star. In contrast, they made it a humour point when the actual star started riffing, which was clever, but then they were fine to have the supporting cast vocals over-power the lead..?\n\nI was so looking forward to this film, but now that I've seen it, it's actually made me less excited for any of the future live action releases.",

It inserts this preachy \"straight line theory\" that shames the grub eaters as oblivious to the idea that everything is connected, While Still Presenting Their World As Paradise.  And making the animal-people ultra realistic only serves to make the idea of eating them even more difficult.\n\nBeyond this, lots of beautiful scenery, cute animals, drama, humor and music.  The message is messy and overall it's not as good as the original except for the extraordinary beauty of it, but not an unpleasant way to spend a few hours, either.",

The songs are all great, and amazing to watch on the big screen, my only complaint is the shortness of the song \"Be prepared\"which could have been the single greatest song in the movie, but didn't quite make it, and it was Disney's fault for wanting it to be as different as possible from the original masterpiece. Yes, the emotions aren't displayed as greatly as in the original, but that's a given, and the voice acting and the phenomenal music accompanying the scenes make up for it. It would be a shame not to watch this movie, it truly is a great film, and watching the final battle between Scar and Simba, and watching all those great cinematic moments, such as 'circle of life' and surprisingly enough 'can you feel the love tonight' and my personal favourite 'can't wait to be king' is absolutely worth it.",

They looked lifeless and that song to form the distraction.  \ud83d\ude12 The production should apologize for such a bad movie, what a mediocre work team.\n\n7) the fight scenes have more emotion an old man.",

It does work and I found my self enjoying this film throughout, with great songs, voice work and the most photorealistic environment I've ever seen. Without ever felling like a so-called cash grab which we all know it to be.

Didn't feel the struggle and importance of that decision like in the animated version. \n\nI didn't care for Donald Glover's rendition of Simba. One of the things about James Earl Jones is that is voice is so clear, he annunciates every syllable, he delivers with a fervent performance, he has power, clarity, and meaning. I didn't feel that with Mr. Glover. Fair comparison to anyone? Not really, but I didn't feel anything for his performance here. I feel really bad for anyone who has to sing opposite Beyonce. Even most professional recording artists. \n\nOverall it just fell flat.  ",

With that thought, the voice work for those hard emotional scenes wasn't there either, Mufasa's death felt less impact full due to the actors lines not hitting right.\nSome scenes were not emphasized on enough while others to much, such as the opening where we follow the little mouse, we dont need to follow it for a whole minute and a half, it adds nothing to the picture. While on the other hand the whole \"Be Prepared\" song number was basically gutted from the film and replaced with the last few lines being \"Talk Sung\" by Scar, another scene taken out, and probably one of the most important, being the scene where Rafiki gives his words of wisdom about learning from the past.\n\nIn the end it is just a cash grab because people will go see these films no matter what, but I have a feeling none will be very good, let alone surpass the original Disney pictures",

Simba is not really resolving his feelings of guilt and the Hakuna Matata song does little to get the message across that a positive outlook can change anything.  Scar is given more screen time than necessary and the final battle between Simba and Scar goes on for far too long.  In fact long enough for my 12 year old grandson to start fidgeting and checking his watch to see when the end would come.  Nala is forgettable and so are most of the other characters with perhaps the exception of Zazu, the dodo bird.

These differences vary from lines to maybe a scene or two but still recognizable.\nNow with Disney and their need to put in the political controversies, they were definitely noticed and thats why it didnt get the full five. However, dont let these things get in the way, enjoy the show and find the positive message in some of these controversies. I did! Ill let you find them",

I didn\u2019t like the voices for all the characters except for mufasa and rafiki. Beyonc\u00e9 was ok a nala and I understand the idea of going with similar but yet different but it was a stretch. The lack of animal emotion was tough. I can imagine it being tough to make the movie move and act like real animals. I mean do animals really know how to laugh and joke and look said and show pain but that movie is one that needed it and lacked alittle. I do really appreciate james earl jones being able to be Mufasa. That\u2019s a role only he could do. Would I go see it again. Definitely not. Aladdin I would but in the plus side, the previews made my wife and I interested in the maleficent movie. Good job!",

One complaint I do have though is the audio. Disney used the original audio from the first movie which I think is a good choice it's just that Disney didn't remaster the audio. At some points it sounds like the audio was recorded on a $10 microphone rather than the new high-quality mics. The lip-syncing with the animation sometimes doesn't look good. I'm surprised that that happened because Disney is known for their masterful animation and how they try to make their movies as perfect as possible. Overall I think it's a good movie and I would recommend it to anyone in ages 7-mid 20s.",

Actually, it wasnt as good because the realistic animation did not convey emotion like the animated version did. It was like a nature documentary with the original script over it. Also, Donald Glover cannot hold a note to save his life! Young Simba had a beautiful voice and once he grew up, it was like someone pressed the downgrade button too many times.

Im glad that James Earl Jones was able to reprise his role as Mufasa but was surprisingly underwhelmed by his performance. Not sure if it has to do with his advanced age now (88) but all things considered, I cant imagine anyone else playing that role. Billy Eichner & Seth Rogen did what they could as Timon & Pumbaa with some genuinely funny parts (especially the hilarious shout out to another Disney classic near the end). Would I see it again? Not likely, but it was a nice reminder of why the original will stand as one of (if not the best) animated movie of all time.",

The kids particularly liked the comic routine of Pumba and Timon (yes, especially the farting!), and their various forest friends.  But what struck me about this movie was the extraordinary precision with which it hewed to the plot of its animated predecessor, with characters, scene, and sequence virtually identical (as well as the songs, which is understandable; and, I think, even the dialogue).  I'm going to look out for the extent to which other Disney live-action successors replicate their canonical referents.

It's these narrative moments that make the film work.  I ultimately give it a moderately positive review because\u2026damnit it's still The Lion King, and yeah there were enough things it did right.  But at the end of the day, if I ever want to see The Lion King again, I'm going to watch the original.",

Don't get me wrong the effects in this movie were fantastic but it doesn't mean anything if I don't feel anything from seeing it. The theme of the movie was lost by the long transitions from scene to scene by Disney trying to show off their technical skills. Therefore, the feeling and emotion evoked from the faces and surroundings of the original Lion King were completely lost. I gave it a star because the singing from the actors were great, and added half a star because of the background visuals. If not for those two things this movie would've gotten zero stars from me.",

            "content": "The visuals in this movie are impressive. The photo realism is astounding, but that's not all this movie should've been. The story was a copy and paste of the original, much like a video game remake. The voice acting was subpar at some points. Some of the most influential scenes (Mufasas death, Scars musical number, Hakuna Matata) were dull and lifeless BECAUSE of the photo realism. The characters can't emote properly so some of the body movements are exaggerated, but then it gives the characters an uncanny valley vibe. One of the best Disney villain songs in my opinion was completely scraped and only had a hint of the original song towards the very end, but even then it wasn't there. Because this is photorealistic, there's no creativity. What should've been inspiration, was just there to be a template to animate over. The lack of facial expressions kills this whole movie. When Simba sees his father dead on the gorge floor in the original, he is so expressive and it makes you feel what Simba is feeling in that moment. In the remake, all of that emotion is lost. No expression, no emotion. If they were making this for a bunch of lions, I'm sure they'd be thankful for the accuracy, but the movie isn't for LIONS it's for HUMANS. Humans rely on facial emotion to properly understand what's happening. Animals (especially felines) don't. They rely on body language. But a lot of people can't read animals. That's why cats are seen as aloof and uncaring. Their owners can't read them. If people aren't able to read real life animals, how are they supposed to read the body language of an imitated animal? So many influential scenes were removed and so many tedious and useless characters were added (ie the animals in the jungle) all for the sake of a joke or a sixty second song. The scene with Mufasas ghost in the clouds was barely recognizable for me in theaters because all I saw was a bunch of clouds with the occasional lightning. When you take one of the worlds most known films and attempt a remake, you should improve on it. Don't try to change the formula. Leave some realistic elements in, but don't try to make it look like I just spent twenty bucks on a movie ticket to watch a National Geographic documentary. This movie was lifeless and a copy paste, but with better graphics. ",

While they have shorter more rushed dialoged in other scene. There is one noted new scene where you see Nala leave pride rock and some add time with Simba, Timon and Pumbaa. If you where thinking with the extra run time they would add more heart and soul the characters backround and story they don't. The songs do not even come close to the original. 'Cant wait to be king' is  just okay at best, they don't even try with Scar 'be prepared', and 'can you feel the love tonight' is just there. ",

Disney castrated them all, because God forbid kids see reproductive organs (eyeroll). Third, there is a lot of violence, very inappropriate for a family movie.

I thought it was beautifully done. The special effects were fantastic and so life-like. I was particularly taken with Donald Glover aka Childish Gambinos vocals when he sang as Simba. This new version brought back nice childhood memories of Hakuna Matata and Can You Feel the Love Tonight. I was able to share the magic of The Lion King with my daughter, who was equally as enthralled as I was.",

I really enjoyed the new voices for Timon (Billy Eichner), Pumbaa (Seth Rogen) and (John Oliver).  Chiwetel Ejiofor's Scar seems more low-key (and menacing) than Alan Rickman's version, while the returning voice work of James Earl Jones as Mufasa was a welcome link to the original version.  The majority of the rest of the primary cast, including Donald Glover (Simba) and Alfre Woodard (Sarabi) is fine )maybe a bit underused), but the chemistry between Beyonce's Nala and Simba seemed off...\n\nIf you liked the original (unless you are a complete purist) you will find the \"live-action\" version of the Lion King an enjoyable show.  The new visuals are stunning, even if the story itself is not improved upon.",

To clarify, the animals only movement was a result of the animators trying to capture the effects of wind hitting their bodies or their movement from one position to the next. The act of breathing which everyone creature does at rest or in motion was only present in the field mouse and possibly 2 or 3 times in Simba. The creatures almost emotionless features left a great deal to the character actors to create in tone of their voices. \n\nSo this movie sadly rated 3 stars since I expected much more. Hard to believe a cartoon version back in 1994 told the story better and demanded more emotional presence that all viewers were in tears. It would have been an even trade-off if the 2019 version kept the same script word for word, atleast that way the viewers could resite scenes along with the movie.",

Of course, they won't give a virtually real looking lion eyebrows that leave their face. It is up to the audience to listen and experience in order to get a feel for what this movie is expressing. Yes, that means use your own imagination. The Lion King has opened so many doors and it's hard to think of an new animated movie that could possible beat this one. Everything was fantastic. A lot of critics will say that they left out important messages that the original movie inputted. However, by watching, laughing, sympathizing, and gaining a connection through this experience does anything but lack those messages. It is truly a masterpiece and I will watch it over and over again with the same mind blowing expression on my face.",

I believe in the duet between Donald Glover and Beyonce wasn't as great as it could've been because Beyonces voice took over at some parts and it didn't sound in harmony as a duet. The movie is definitely worth the watch though! The CGI was incredible and it's amazing how they stayed with the original story just with a few extras in it",

And people who called this movie lazy, don't know the definition of lazy. A single blink in this movie is probably tens of thousands of dollars of cgi you missed. How good the CGI is makes this the least lazy live action remake. Considering how they could not just use human actors, they had to use CGI for everything. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.",

Honestly, all the voice actors sounds so uninterested & tired, it sounds like they all took half a bottle of NyQuil before recording. \ud83d\ude1d\n\nSome things don\u2019t work in live action. These animals seem so robotic, & there\u2019s no emotion on any of their faces! \ud83d\ude10 I think a brick wall had more emotion than these f*cking characters\u2019 faces. \ud83d\ude02 .\n\nAll these Disney remakes are the same, goddamnit! They\u2019re all wildly MEDIOCRE, with little charm or life to them, and only exist to show off pretty visuals and to make money lazily.\nThen again, it was at least funny to watch my friend right next to me get really MAD in the theater. \ud83d\ude02",

I have to say, the artisty of using CGI was pretty darn good, but having pretty pictures and animation to almost lifelike characters and scenes wasnt enough to save this movie. The voice over of the animals made it seem more fake than anything, and seriously,\u00a0 this was an animated movie in 1994 there was really a lack of expression and character from start to finish. If disney\u00a0 is going to remake such an iconic movie such as The Lion King at least try and make it decent and not like a children's documentary movie with poorly talking animals and dull expressions. Nevertheless the story was more to the original Hamlet, which definitely shows disney takes the hard work of others and spins it off for their entertainment and financial benefit.

I felt the burning need to jump up and make out with Donald Glover's Simba more often than I care to admit. That shit was w-e-t. They managed to squeeze a little heaven, a.k.a Beyonc\u00e9, in there, while the annoying Brit, John Oliver, plays the annoying British bird. So give that casting director a raise! The soundtrack? More cinematic than it was before because the only thing better than percussion is more percussion. The story? Unchanged, but ain't nothin' higher than #1, to quote Beyonc\u00e9's husband. Timon and Pumbaa have new jokes, Chiwetel Ejiofor tries to sing \"Be Prepared,\" bless him, while James Earl Jones and Mufasa officially become one light. I am missing Nala's smug feminist journey, Simba's Transformation is too dialed in like a 1-900 number, and if you're gonna hire John Kani to play the red-assed Rafiki you give the man some more work because he's everything. As always, I wanted more Beyonc\u00e9, but I'm just thinking out loud, folks...all I can say is thank God they didn't get Emma Watson to do more singing. Roar. Woof. Squawk. Sorry girl, love you!",

But again you can't not compare it to the original which of course is better .\n\nApparently there was 30 minutes more added to this remake which I rarely noticed when watching the film except for when they threw in a bit of Beyonc\u00e9 just to fit in her new song .\n\nOverall kids that are just being introduced to Disney will love it and the adults going with them will enjoy the nostalgia factor that made them love the original.\n",

It was a fresh take that allowed me as the viewer to be emotionally invested and not be distracted by the goofiness of cartonny storyboards as when this story was told in the 90's.\n The voice actors did their jobs , withh Seth Rogen and Beyonce standing out amongst the cast, and The Neptunes & Elton John did spectacular remixes to a soundtrack that never knew it needed a touch up.\nThere was a comic book adaptation of this that enjoyed reading above all retellings of this story , but Favreau's reboot of this stroy is in a class of it's own by sheer visual effects alone so much so that all interpretations of this film that came before don't even deserve to be put in comparison.\nNow whatever happened to that Mogli film?",

That plus, rushed dialouge, (felt like they (even James Earl Jones!) were reading a script for some of the old good dialouge) too loud music during a couple major dialouge scenes, way too much screen time for the mouse Scar was planning to eat and Simba's hair floating to Rafiki. And how did he know it was Simba's? It had touched water, a giraffe's tongue and dirt; I don't know how it would have still held Simba's scent. And it's just a piece of hair, not his hair all over the grass and flowers like in the original. How did he know who it was just by a look? Nala also recognized Simba way too fast! And though the lions were real-looking and beautiful, it took away from the emotion. Young Simba's crying and yet I see no tears and see no sadness on his face, so it took away from some of the emotional scenes. Minor note but Mufasa roared on the cliff scene. I preferred the original where his scream and roar was combined when Scar clawed him. It was also hard to tell the difference between Sarabi and Nala. A couple minor changes, a couple added lines to Scar and Timon and Pumbaa were good, but nothing spectacular. I couldn't see Mufasa in the sky. With all the special effects, I thought that would have been at least like the original, maybe better. Rafiki calls his stick his old friend, yet we never saw it in the beginning. He wasn't funny and silly, and he kept speaking in a different language which was confusing and not needed. And they took out him hitting Simba on the head! That was needed for Simba to change his mind and had a great moral lesson! And last but not least, they cut Be Prepared, one of the best songs ever made by Disney!! I understand why they did because the original is condescending to the hyena pack and they were a lot creepier and more aggressive in this version. But they could have done the song so much better. They shouldn't have even bothered making it if they were gonna do it like this. No need. Usually Disney does a great job, (like Aladdin. Those changes made sense and it was really live action, real people!) but unfortunately, they didn't live up to the original, not even close. ",

Beyonc\u00e9 voice pulled me away from the move, her voice is to recognizable and she didn\u2019t try to mask or change it, so every time she had a line it felt like I was listening to Beyonc\u00e9 and not Nala....it was the same with Seth rogen and the warthog. When it comes to CGI and animation I think it\u2019s important to have a voice that\u2019s not recognizable because you start to reference the voice to the actual person which ruins the movie or at least have the actor mask or change they\u2019re voice.

Having that in mind I wasn't, like most, particularly excited about this remake nor was I expecting anything extraordinary. And I would be lying if I said I wasn't entertained. Yes, the story is completely recycled from the 1994 original almost shot-for-shot but that wasn't a big problem for me. I would recommend seeing this film if only to witness the stunning CGI on display here. It's genuinely photorealistic -  I might as well had been watching a Nat Geo documentary in that theater. I also have to mention the voice work of Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen as Timon & Pumba. The stars of this movie as far as I'm concerned. Perfect casting. The jokes never fall flat and I found myself truly laughing on more than one occasion. Donald Glover suprisingly delivers an underwhelming performance as adult Simba. Almost emotionless most of the time. I was also glad to hear James Earl Jones as Mufasa once again, always great in his iconic role. However, the pacing of the movie felt a bit off, almost as if it was rushed. That made me feel a bit detached from the story and I found myself not really caring much about the characters nor was the ending as cathartic as in the original. It's a 3.5 for me.",

I wish I could see this movie without that advantage. Would it still carry well? Possibly, it's still a strong story, but I feel the real problem is the lack of emotion in the new portrayals, both in the voices as well as the lack of expression in the faces. Even James Earl Jones sounds tired and bored. Also, with songs as popular as these, every nuance sticks out. Kid Simba is basically lacking in emotion entirely both speaking and singing, new Zazu doesn't even ATTEMPT to be fun and interesting, kid Nala sounds like she's reading off her script, or at best maybe had one chance to read it over before delivering lines. Ugh and Timon and Pumba make Hakuna Matata a cringefest (as was Just can't Wait to be King). It really makes me wonder if these are good songs without the influence of the original. I generally enjoy covers when theyre done well, but I can't help but cringe at these attempts. \n\nTo conclude my review, its only not awful because I'm watching the original in my head and overlaying it over this. Also, butchering Be Prepared wasn't the answer. I'd rather it be gone entirely than have what they did.",

The CGI looks great, but when the animals look so real it strips the characters of the humanity that can only be expressed in cartoon animation.  Every single moment of this movie was several steps below the original to the point where it was frustrating to watch.  It felt like every actor was phoning it in, even James Earl Jones, who was delivering the same lines as he did before, just worse somehow.  This movie was too long and yet felt like everything was rushed down to a high school first time table-read.  The only good thing about this movie by a long shot was John Oliver as Zazu who did a really good job and I enjoyed any moment he was on screen; perfect for the part.  Scar's voice and lines were by far the most disappointing. I could never think of a situation in which I would watch this instead of the original.",

This wasnt helped by the fact that the CGI just cannot emote. Simba's \"I Just Cant Wait To Be King\" face is exactly the same as his \"Dad, why wont you wake up?\" Face.\n\nThis feels like the result of a dare. \"I bet you cant make a shot-for-shot remake of The Lion King in CGI.\" And the answer was, yes you can...

In short, it's similar to James Cameron's \"Avatar:\" Praised for its stunning visual achievements but will soon be forgotten because there is nothing else that truly makes it stand out from any of the other films we've seen.

I thought the casting of the cub versions of Simba and Nala as well as Timon and Pumba should have been rethought. The acting was not very good. Singing voices of cub Simba and Nala were beautiful. I couldn\u2019t help but feel the sound, exciting energy and humor of the original just wasn\u2019t there. It would have been fun to see more of the original characters come back.

Why Disney keeps stomping on the things that we love and care about?\n\nThe characters were awful, Simaba is more reckless, weak and scary cat than it was before and Nala is more obnoxious, I used to love Nala because she was the anchor of Simba she was that little support and self awareness that Simba needed, now she's more like an obnoxious whip that never stops. \n\nIn this version most of the comic relieves were removed or changed for something else,  this is disheartening because these scenes were part of the core of the movie, I remember when I was a little kid the hyenas made laugh so hard, here they removed most of their scenes so no laugh anymore. \n\nThe music was great though. I still feel goosebumps when listening to \"Can you feel the love tonight\" and \"The circle of life\"; beautiful music in deed, and I believe the movie has some of the best songs a movie can have.\n\nIn short, this movie pales on comparison to the animated version.

Obviously as a cartoon, you can have as much expression has you want but if you're dealing with real-life visuals, not so much. It didn't bother me personally.

But as I watched the, quote-on-quote \"live-action\" remake, I felt pretty much NOTHING. \n\nWhen Mufasa died (SPOILER ALERT), I felt NOTHING. \n\nWhen Simba roared to become king, I felt NOTHING. \n\nThe film completely lacks the emotional depth of the original, and we're left with little more than a soulless shot-for-shot remake of the animated masterpiece. Granted, the visuals are spectacular, and the CGI is great, but this is that rare occasion where that is a bad thing. The animals look far too real to express any real form of emotion, which was my biggest concern going into this movie. \n\nThe voice cast is solid, with Seth Rogen (Pumbaa) and Billy Eichner (Timon) stealing the show. They were even nice enough to bring back James Earl Jones to voice Mufasa. Unfortunately, that was the only returning member of the original voice cast, which I feel was a mistake. Chiwetel Ejiofor was an AWFUL replacement for Jeremy Irons as Scar, and the way the movie butchers the song \"Be Prepared\" is simply mind-boggling. The rest of the songs are perhaps the highlight of the film, providing you with a rush of nostalgia, most notably in the \"Circle of Life\" opening. To be honest, that may have actually been my favorite scene in the movie.\n\nNobody wanted a remake of The Lion King, which was already perfect in its original form. The only reason for this movie's existence is to be a quick cash grab, which Disney has gotten in the form of over a billion dollars and counting. For me, I've officially had enough of these cheaply made live-action remakes. Perhaps these films will resonate with this current generation of kids, and that's OK. The question now is whether or not it comes at the expense of mine.",

I had watched the movie many times as a child for it was my brother's favorite movie, and based on how Disney had rewritten the stories for this new age of live-action remakes (such as Maleficent not being as evil, and the side story in Dumbo) I had high hopes and high expectations. However, Disney did NOT meet up to those expectations. \n\nFirst off, the voice acting was not good, most notable in Beyonce's work. While I love Queen Bee, I detested her voice acting, and I'm quite sick of actual talented voice actors being replaced by A-List Celebrities just for the star quality to use in promotions to push out the movie and gain more money. Evidently, Disney values quantity over quality (not that I didn't already know this).\n\nFor the movie being a complete remake of the original without any new focus or plot-line, I at least expected it to be better, but it wasn't. The song sequences in the original were dull in the movie due to the lack of vibrant colors and stunning animation, and I was not very fond of the singing either. This was a definite complaint in 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight?' and 'I Just Can't Wait to be King'. There was simply too much riffing for it to be enjoyable (for me at least) and while the singers are talented, I just wasn't into the style of singing compared to Disney's simpler yet powerful music- where the singers shows their prowess in the power of their voice rather than in how much they can riff notes (again, I was mostly annoyed with Beyonce). It turned from a sing-a-long tune to a listen-and-appreciate song, which was not something I wanted from such a staple like 'I Just Can't Wait to be King'. \n\nMost egregious, however, was the fact that they CUT SCAR'S VILLIAN SONG! IT WAS LIKE THIRTY SECONDS! WTF!? IT MIGHT NOT BE A 'HELLFIRE', BUT IT WAS STILL GOOD, AND THE ANIMATION SEQUENCE FOR IT IN THE ORIGINAL WAS SO AMAZING WITH THE GREEN TINT AND EVERYTHING, UGH!\n\nThe only thing that was an improvement was the comic relief characters Timon and Pumbaa, and I wouldn't mind getting a Lion King 1 1/2, as long as they were just as funny.\n\nI suppose the movie would be good for the new generation that can't compare it to the original (but I'd most certainly never let my little cousins watch this before feasting on the beauty that was 1994's Lion King), but for older viewers like me (lol, I'm only seventeen), DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. The original Lion King's on Netflix now, just watch it there. \n\n",

What it lacked in inspiration and creativity story-wise, it compensated with a stunning exhibition of the great power of modern CGI.

            "content": "If you could think which Disney classic seems to be more of a masterpiece, taking it further on a majestic scale, \"The Lion King\" would arguably come to mind as the most outstanding animated presentation \u2013 with questionable origin, while Jon Favreau's reimagined \"The Jungle Book\" takes the top podium for the live-action medium. The obvious connection between the two films is Favreau's ambition of exploiting the amazing technological effects that brought \"The Jungle Book\" to life, with blended vie for faithfulness that marks his authorship, and \"The Lion King\", being Disney's Renaissance peak, is another nature film with a legendary stance that makes it a perfect challenge to tackle in another reimagining. The remake does not exactly reach the mighty volume but is without a doubt generally beautiful and honorably triumphant.\n\n\"The Lion King\", marking the 25th anniversary of the original majesty, is agreeably inferior but nonetheless great from the scenic imagery masking authentic natural wonders as the definite counterpart form of photorealism to the overall soul consisting the musical score and vocal performances. The kinetic energy between the CGI-created environment and the mostly new cast bringing their connected characters to life is what makes the onscreen appearances as perfect embodiments, indicating how utterly faithful Favreau passionately honored without ruining the formulaic greatness. With a lot of iconic aspects that could not be completely revised nor flipped whilst still the same narrative touch in the flow, he still obliged with the current traditional routine of modernizing meanings, differentiating insights and originated intentions that were more pointed out towards the classic with very little to improve. The story is Shakespearean through \"Hamlet\", and Favreau pushed the story closer to its original source material.\n\nHowever, the film is mostly criticized for being more of a shot-for-shot remake without adding anything new to the whole story. While that may be true unlike how the past remakes enhanced the experience with updated storytelling and opportune positions for character arcs that were not thought of at the time,  and there are only little expansion in the script's subtle heftiness, it is rather proof that the story can still be told under a new aesthetic with the same enjoyment value \u2013 like how praiseworthy remakes did when reusing the formula. As the main intention is to honor the story, Favreau explored it dimensionally albeit being at times questionably disruptive in contrast to the original's smoothness, and the effects adds little more depth such as the expressions when emotions are expressed.\n\nOne element that pleasantly remains the same between the two is the music with composer Han Zimmer reprising his role in spiritually lifting the story's spirit once again, revitalizing the circle of life. The opening number, presented by the franchise's collaborative performer Lebo M featuring Rafiki theatrical performer Lindiwe Mkhize, gives the film's first impression with an ever-chilling effect as it amplifies the scene \u2013 and given the background information shows the faithful lengths that were pursued.\n\nThe Broadway-equivalent fine cast has lent their voices to the beloved, memorable characters with matching yet refreshing spirit including the update's more modernized tone. James Earl Jones' return as Mufasa is an awesome touch in revisiting the Pride Lands with the mightily classic guidance. The rest of the cast, becoming part of the challenging retelling, did exceptionally well in their performances, with some proudly matching the original voices as a step further of doing their part in honoring the legacy's initial characterization. The only flaw is not making up for agreeing in shorthand to follow the disruptive flow on very few, noticeable occasions.\n\nJon Favreau triumphs in successfully tackling the ambitious challenge of remaking a classic, while enforcing photorealism as another masking medium for filmic storytelling and again demonstrating faithful lengths in really connecting to the story while honoring it. He did just that in exploring the circle of life in a way he wanted to tell it, despite being more flawed than his previous jungle expedition that was only groundbreaking and additionally hefty. \"The Lion King\" may not roar as mighty nor in a majestic fashion to the king's royal level, the undemanding remake successfully and perfectly naturally replicated the epic power to bolster the entertainment value in being noted as this year's best live-action remake from the brand, with beauty and honor.

Then add to all of it the mediocre reviews I'd seen from @petertravers & others that I really align with & you get my reason for holding out a few weeks. Let me start by saying: the movie is amazing to look at & I have no idea how they have perfected digital animation to a point that you can't tell what's real & what's not. I thought until I read otherwise today that the landscapes were all location shots & characters then digitally inserted. I had no idea the entire thing save one shot was digitally rendered. The knocks on it are legit: there's just not as much vibrancy & life as the original. You can't recreate those colorful, coordinated animations digitally. But it makes up for it by bringing to life an awesome story. You forget the animals aren't real. It's remarkable. Probably won't rent or purchase on demand but will watch when it comes on TNT later. Don't need to see again in theater but worth paying to see. Obviously appropriate for all ages.",

Favreau absolutely nailed the dichotomy of the two styles in Jungle Book and simply failed in Lion King. The Jungle Book has believability when Baloo sings to himself/Mogli while floating the river. King Louis doesn\u2019t sing when he\u2019s confronting Mogli and the scene is immensely more terrifying and believable. I wasn\u2019t scared of Scar when he \u201csang\u201d Be Prepared. I didn\u2019t feel whimsical at Can\u2019t Wait to be King. Honestly the best musical segment was Lion Sleeps tonight because it provided some comical relief and built itself naturally. Speaking of poor music choices, Lion King 2019 had the opportunity to truly marry the beloved animated film with the beloved broadway musical and just...didn\u2019t. The available soundtrack even has several songs from the broadway show, yet the film does not use them. Instead of \u201cHe Lives in You\u201d we have Beyonc\u00e9 singing \u201cspirit\u201d over and over. Rather than \u201cShadowlands\u201d, we have...\u201dBe Our Guest?\u201d The Beauty and the Beast reference was completely out of place and really took away from the scene. Lastly, although the animation is beautifully done, Favreau dug his heels in on the realism. The magnificent color pallet and character design/humanism in the original animated film is replaced with emotionless hyper-realistic animals and sets. No longer the rich and dramatically colorful landscapes and emotive characters, but more of the dry earth tones and expressionless animals. Any wildlife documentary does a better job of highlighting Africa\u2019s immense beauty and diversity. I can understand Favreau\u2019s desire to cater to the nostalgic audience, but it feels, again, like he couldn\u2019t decide what movie he wanted to make. Was it a frame by frame remake or was is a serious toned adaptation with small tributes to the source material? Yes. ",

I give it points for the visual technology, for the score, for the cinematography, and some of the acting, but overall there's just a feeling that it's lacking the soul it needs, because they decided to make the animation just a little too realistic, where the animals simply are expressionless, and it hurts the movie.\n\nI don't know why they took that approach. It's been proven before that realistic models/lighting/materials can mesh very well with a slightly more cartoony animation. In fact, some of the best animation I've ever seen has been done that way, and this movie would have been improved if they handled things that way. Take a look at Rocket Raccoon for a relevant recent example of a mostly photorealistic animal that animates properly. Even The Jungle Book handled this better. \n\nIt's still mostly an enjoyable experience, because I mean, it's still the Lion King, but with the obvious comparisons you're going to make, even a decently made movie is still going to feel underwhelming compared to a practically flawless original. So yes, my words may seem at odds with my rating, but overall, this was still a well made movie. It just didn't live up to the bar it needed to hit.",

        {
            "content": "Man... where do I start with this one... I came into this film hearing both good things about the film from friends and bad things from critics, so I tried to keep an open mind, but this one was really quite a disappointment. While I can tell that a lot of hard work was put into this movie, as a whole, it just failed in so many ways. In case you haven't heard, the new Lion King is very closely followed to that of a shot to shot remake. There are some subtle differences to the film, but nearly all of them are much more for worse than for better. While there are some problems I have with the idea of a shot to shot remake, I wouldn't mind it too much if they had kept the heart of the original intact. However, they didn't and that can be broken down into 2 main reasons. \n\n(1). The Cinematography. What I'm about to say may not make sense at first, but bear with me. I truly believe that some absolutely amazing work was done in terms of the visual effects for this film. So much time and effort was put in from this department and it shows in its realism (even if it does cross into the uncanny valley occasionally). However, despite this fact, the movie is so visually boring. Sure, the visual effects of the film may look realistic, but that doesn't mean they look good from an artistic perspective. Everything is just so dull looking and anticolorful. Sure it looks like I'm watching a documentary, but it's a documentary that contains flat, boring shots that do nothing to show off the beauty of Africa. If you want visuals like that, go watch Planet Earth. That movie is stunning! Compare the visuals of the remake to that of the animated original. Because the original isn't hindered by its ideology that it has to look as realistic as possible, it has the creative freedom to exaggerate. To do things that you just couldn't without it being animated. One scene, in particular, was that of \"I Just Can't Wait to Be King\". In the original, as soon as the music hits, the animation changes and the world becomes gorgeously colorful. The whole scene is Simba and Nala interacting with all the animals in fun and creative ways that make for a joyous time. Contrast to the original and its both of them running around the watering hole trying to hide from Zazu. Nothing special. The problem with the choice of making it look like a documentary is that it adds restrictions to the film that the original could ignore and run wild with! The visual style may look realistic for the most part, but that doesn't mean it looks good.\n\n(2).The performances. I have to first off preface this by stating that I in no way believe that any the actors in this film are bad actors. On the contrary, there is a whole lot of voice-talent in this film! However, what we hear is only half of what we get when it comes to performances in a film like this. That other half of the performances was that of the facial expressions. ESPECIALLY the ones pertaining to any of the lion characters. I know this goes back a little to the previous point I made, but the idea of making this film look hyperrealistic hurt this film in so many ways! Because they decided that these lions need to look and act as realistic as possible, they dumbed down their facial expressions to the point that you can barely tell what any of them are thinking. It merely looked like voices dubbed poorly over nature documentary footage. Imagine seeing an actor sound like they are truly crying and balling as they stare at the lifeless body of their father with eyes that only seem mildly upset. That is what watching this film was like. I could never take any of these performances seriously despite the talent behind these voices. Even James Earl Jones sounded bored in this movie!! The only real exceptions to this in the film were from Timon and Pumba. They were hilarious! They were allowed to be different and the animation used for them allowed the expressiveness in their voice to actually come out and shine. \n\nThere were many other problems I had with the film (i.e. theme removal, incredibly rushed scene pacing, \"Be Prepared\" is shortened to a sloppy mess, and WAY too many riffs from Beyonce and Donald Glover), but these two points were the main ones that stuck out to me.",

Although the original voice actor who played Mufasa came back for this remake movie I was absolutely disappointed in his  performance. His  dialogue were similar to the animated version but in no way was said with the same enthusiasm and seriousness, it was just boring and very dull. \n3. I enjoyed Nothing about this movie all I could do was shake my head during it all \nMy advice would have been to keep to the same dialogue as the original.

            "content": "I truly enjoyed the original Lion King, it deserves all the attention it gets. I was cautious as I entered the theater to see the latest Disney live action remake, although nothing in the film is not entirely computer generated. But I was hopeful, I wanted to enjoy this movie. Directed by Jon Favreau? I love Iron Man, and even the live-action Jungle Book! I will start with the pros. First and foremost, the VFX. This is probably the most photorealistic CGI I have ever seen in any movie ever, and I say that with confidence. I cannot imagine how long it took to animate this film. The casting was pretty good. I thought it was a smart move to hire James Earl Jones to voice Mufasa a second time, because, let us be honest, that guy is irreplaceable! Donald Glover as Simba, Beyonc\u00e9 as Nala, John Oliver as Zazu, were really good. I think the best voice performance, though, was Seth Rogen as Pumba. Now for the cons. Being a shot for shot remake, you know exactly what is going to happen, when it is going to happen, how it is going to happen, and so forth. The remake of Beauty And The Beast, which I also disliked, was shot for shot as well, but they sprinkled it with a few new songs, new scenes, and some dialogue alterations. The Lion King, on the other hand, the original has more scenes than this. They have shortened this movie by at least twenty minutes. Remember Be Prepared in the original? In this, the song is less than thirty seconds. Also, some of the characters do not have a fraction of the charm as they did in the original. For example, Rafiki is wise, but a bit of a joker in the original. In this, he is just wise. Even Scar is not as intimidating as he was. Another thing, being as photorealistic as it is, the characters cannot make facial expressions. Since the original was a cartoon, they could smile, frown, cry, scream, and gasp. Realistically speaking, a Lion cannot do any of those things. So when they talk, they look like they are simply opening their mouths, and this flaw is sometimes laughable. The biggest flaw, however, is that this movie has absolutely no reason to exist. There is not one thing wrong with the original, so why remake this if there is nothing that can be improved upon?\n\nIn short, this was the first movie I have ever seen in an acttheater that bored me to the point to where I longed for the credits to roll.",

It was visually stunning, but fails to capture the raw emotion and heart of the original animated version. There were a couple of issues I had with the live-action remake. First, 3/4's of the film sounded like the actors phoned in their lines.  An exception to this is the musical number, \"Can You Feel The Love Tonight,\" which sounds like Beyonce Knowles and Donald Glover were actually in the studio. Second, there were a surprising amount of lines, musical numbers, and jokes that were cut from the live-action remake that was in the original animated film. The previous, coupled with the lack of facial expressions from the photo-realistic animals, made the film feel hollow and dull. Lastly, I was unimpressed by the amount of energy, life, and charisma the acting cast put into the characters. Especially Chiwetel Ejiofor who played a very flat Scar (I missed the sassy, sarcastic drama-king version that Jeremy Irons portrayed). The exceptions to this are James Earl Jones (Mufasa), Billy Eichner (Timon), and Seth Rogen (Pumbaa). The skit where Timon starts singing \"Be Our Guest\" from Disney's, Beauty and The Beast, was terrific and hilarious.",

This movie is almost monochromatic, except instead of white and black, it's dull brown and green. I almost dozed off multiple times. The animals and scenery look incredibly real, but it meshes oddly with the voice actors. Which is it, Disney? You can't have realistic-looking scenes and talking animals. Oh, wait, but you did anyway-and the end result suffers. The movie is stuck, caught between hyper-realism and obvious, flat voice acting. The stripping of one of the film's best songs (Be Prepared) and complex characters (Scar) is also a cinematic crime. Scar used to be sarcastic and oddly charming as a villain, but after this shaved down version, he's a flat caricature that needs a bath and better conditioner. If photo-realism is the hill Disney wants to die on, I'm certainly not going to watch the Lady and the Tramp remake. Why should I pay to watch another terrible live-action that is forced to rely on nostalgia rather than stand up on its own two feet? At least Beauty and the Beast was pretty to look at, even if it changed little. Perhaps the best was the first: Cinderella was exquisite and charming, truly worthy of a live-action. If only Disney had put in half the effort here that was shown in the first of the remakes.",

Beyonc\u00e9's singing, for instance, is faultless - even with great studio refinement. But having a very out-of-place song of hers upon the determined return of Simba is just cringeworthy.\n\n\nNevertheless, for new generations of children, Disney has to adapt its productions to popular trends in order to profit. But count me out. As menacing as Scar was, Disney have faltered in reproducing a story - which, was not even their first original in 1994 (see Kimba/Simba controversy) - and consequently we have to endure all this hype about something extremely underwhelming.",

I think it's just a limitation of transitioning from an animated medium to a live action one where anthropomorphizing the animals to express emotions would probably just look weird.\n\nMany of the voice actors I also felt were flat. Chiwetel Ejiofor, Donald Glover, & Beyonc\u00e9's performances were just lifeless. Not to mention I could barely hear/make out the majority of John Oliver's dialogue. James Earl Jones was perfect and spot on as usual. The songs were good, not as good as the original imo, but still they weren't too bad. I missed the original \"Be Prepared\" and that Beyonc\u00e9 song seemed so out of place.

The emotional moments still hit just as hard as they used to while much of the music is scaled back in favor of intense almost Star Wars like action scenes. Director Jon Favreau takes The Lion King and transforms it into modern animation and thrilling suspense. If you want to hear all the songs again, listen to the soundtrack or go see the show on Broadway.

            "content": "I ABSOLUTELY hated this movie. Growing up on lion king, them singing, dancing and the emotional journey the movie took us on. I understand you can only do so much with \"live action\". But before someone does a \"live action\" movie with animals I think they should study the animal and how they act. Example: simba roars and the  wildebeest come running down the cliff. The live action had simba standing there saying \"oh no.\" An actual cat would have probably layers it's ears down and hunkered down in fear. Kind of what they did in the cartoon. And I'm actually pissed about scar. Scar was shown to be mean, scary and very dark. His voice was very dark and unsettling. Example: in the cartoon mufasa jumps on the cliff, climbs to the top to see scar staring down at him. Mufasa then asks scar to help him and scar proceeds to dig his claws into mufasas arms and in a scary deep clam voice tells mufasa \"long....live...... the king\". In the live action mufasa climbs up to the top of the cliff to find scar. In this scene scar digs his claws into mufasa (just like the original) the in a very high toned voice and yells \"long live the king\". There was no emotion given in this scene and this was THE MOST EMOTIONAL SCENE OF THE MOVIE. This movie was NOT the movie to choose to do a live action. Many things where left out. The emotional was not given, there was no accuracy in this movie in which lions \"actually move\" since they where going for live action. Everything was dull. The symbolism was left out with  Rafiki  And simba. Example:  Rafiki  Hits simba in the head with the stick. Simba asks \"what was that for\"  and Rafiki replies \"doesn't matter it was in the past\". There was SO much that they could have done with this film. It was SUCH a disappointment. I will NEVER buy this movie. EVER. The original was so much better.",

They are right, it does play out very similar to the 1994 film. That is why it's called a \"remake\". It wouldn't be a remake if they wrote a brand new story. Critics are overpaid.\n\nI took my two oldest daughters to this today, and we all loved it. The familiar music, the familiar lines and scenes all brought back memories to the classic original, which remains to this day my favorite Disney film. The added humor, and even some hilarious line changes and references to other Disney movies make this adaptation unique enough to not be an exact clone of the original, but with the same characters, plot and story that we've all come to love.\n\nThere is some elements of scare for smaller children as the CGI does make the animals look real, but the humor, fun and playful nature of characters like Timon and Pumba largely make up for the occasional scare.\n\nAnd yes, I LOVED the new version of \"Be Prepared\", because the animated version had hundreds of Hyenas lined up like a Nazi Germany parade, and this film was much more lifelike in its portrayal of the hyenas.\n\nDon't listen to the naysayers and just go see the film and judge it for yourself.

Thank goodness for James Earl Jones who is the only Mufasa!  Some decent or mediocre performances and some downright awful.  Almost left theatre, but felt committed to see it through.  My 11 year old who also LOVES lion king asked 3x to go home. \n\n I have never given a review, but honestly save your $ and wait to see on tv.

            "content": "-First few minutes of the intro gave me shills, it was great. A sense of community was present at first that slowly dissipated. The story became more self-centered as it went on.  \n-Gorgeous character and landscape visuals except the stars \n-Great recorded animal behaviors \n-Quick, bland and inadequate script writing (with a few good jokes once in a while) \n-Young Simba is a small miscast(The character itself is not courageous, not fooled, but foolish from the get go) the high-pitch voice wasn't very soothing)\n-Cut shorter than the previous version \n-Lack of depth\n-Wisdom filled messages covered up by hurried script writing once again \n-Failure to represent the \"normal distribution\" that shapes a society. Of course it's always good vs evil with Disney. Truth is, it is getting old and real life is much more nuanced. The encouragement of said stereotypes aren't very educational, especially when there are no facts or reasons built around to explain a wrongdoer's actions, leaving the impression that it is okay to forget to have empathy and feel self-righteous. Sure Scar can be petty, lie and cruel in his intentions. Shouldn't the hero ask himself a bit more questions as to why? Children aren't born that way, that's for sure... \n-The villain or opponent is showed as less intelligent and sly. He doesn't truly need to manipulate Simba all that much since the cub just follows him along. Didn't he have a warning from Moufassa or has the King too much on his mind to warn the son he so dearly cares for? Doesn't make sense. \n-Some people will start to question the difference between courage, risk and poor judgement. \n-Tasteful soundtrack \n---This is an on-the-side comment---\nIt would be extraordinary if Disney stopped making super-hero movies all while re-creating or (re-stashing) their traditional masterpieces, even if they generate big bucks. They are a multi-billion dollar company and are looking like they run on greed more than dreams now a days. It would be extraordinary if they worked towards more original content. Now is not the time for distractions, but to make people more self and world-aware. Even a message promoting a good charity at the end would have been an interesting to do.\n",

I loved the new sound track and how they did the movements and transitions to bring the dancing to mind without making the animals behave out of character. The little quips and side monologue were awesome. The only thing I can say bothered me a couple times were the facial expressions.

So I will give Disney credit for sticking to the original story line.  A few things were different, but not in a bad way.  My problem with the movie was mostly with the dialog and singing.  First, Beyonce should never have been cast for this.  Her signing is good (usually), but her voice overs and her song in the movie were just flat terrible!  Then there was hakuna matata......it was just so flat and boring.  The original is so fun and engaging.  This version was none of that.  And then there was the rest of the dialog of the actors.  It was like listening to a B movie with rookie actors.  They knew the lines, but no emotions, no flow and just bad.  \n\nBottom line:  not worth seeing.  Maybe for a Redbox on a rent 1, get 1 free.",

So when news of the remake came out, I was doubtful of the quality of it, as most remakes usually fall flat on its face.\n\nAnd this was no different. Apart from the amazingly life-like CGI and the sporadic nostalgia-evoking moments, the whole remake fell way short of the original animation. Voice actors were not picked properly, feeling like they were cast merely for their name.\n\nRafiki's role felt sidelined, without much emphasis on his impact on Simba's decisions and change of heart. Despite having a heavyweight cast of musicians, the songs felt flat and uninspired, emotionless. \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" was butchered, and sung in broad daylight.\n\nOverall, it was disappointing, but not the worst Disney remake.\n\nRating: 5.25/10",

Personally, I thought the casting of Beyonce as the voice of Nala was a major flaw. I didn't know who's voice it was - just that it was jarringly not in sync with the rest of the cast. And I like Beyonce - just not here as the voice of Nala. Otherwise, it's a must see for any avid movie fan - if just for the amazing artistry of the CG animation.",

In fact, so little of the script is changed that it ends up feeling like a tedious, less visually interesting clone of the original. \n\nWhile it is obvious that a lot of money and effort was put into the photo-realistic animation, the lack of expressiveness really hurts it in places. The audience at my theater straight up laughed at the scene when Simba yelled \"no!\" with a totally blank expression as Mufasa was plunging to his death. When the movie flashes back to that scene near the end, they laughed AGAIN. One of the most notoriously crushing scenes in movie history, completely robbed of its impact by a production that was so committed to realism that they refused to match the emotion of the voice acting with the facial expressions of its characters. Don't even get me started on the unbelievably boring performance of \"Be Prepared\"; might as well have cut the song out of the movie entirely.",

There was so little emotion in the most emotional scene. That sentiment was consistent throughout the movie in most of the dramatic scenes, and heck some of the more comedic scenes too. I'm not angry, \"just disappointed\". Its a passable copy, and i will admit that seeing some of the scenes in that beautiful CGI moved me in a new nostalgic way,( the opening sequence, the storm on pride rock) but that's it, its just a beautiful copy with some serious delivery problems. Also, what the hell is up with that Beauty and the Beast reference? That was a wasted comedic opportunity to do something new and clever. Last thing, the Spirit song...way to cheat me out of that chest thumping \"Return to Pride Rock\" sequence. The new song could have gone into the credits...",

Many people gave 1 star and I felt unfair, you gave this level work 1 star really?!! Have you seen what a 1 star film look like??? It's heart- touching and more detailed than old film. The best Disney film ever I'd say. I'm considering watching it for a 2nd time. It's worth every pence and every second in two hours! Go watch it!",

Some of the new songs didn't fit the movie plot and the old songs were underwhelming. I appreciated how they extended the story a bit but some scenes didn't add substance, only length. And there were some overly-dramatic, iconic scenes from the original that they completely took out that made the original stand out.\n\nIn summary, I think the the writers, directors and actors didn't do the original justice. There was only a 25-year gap between the original and this rendition...meaning most people who saw the original would have taken their kids to see this new one, so they should have done focus groups or something for their decisions.",

It took a while to figure out where the new musical score and other new items were spread out through this version.  I think what really impressed me was also what degraded the movie to a four (instead of a five) was the fact that animals do not \"operate\" or \"work\" together like portrayed in the movie (real world, I know what a drag), so my brain was functioning more as an analyst trying to see where the real animals were in comparison to the CGI pieces.\n\nIf you have never seen the original anime or stage musical, then this movie would be a five and blow out the competition for the 2020 Oscars (Feb 2020). But I think what will likely happen is this version of the Lion King will get best/most technical of productions (I mean the CGI blending was that good), but it will not get best picture nomination more likely best screen adaptation, but it will be a STEEP competition against Cats (live action musical movie version) coming out for that title.",

The cartoon is excellent, vibrant and original. This version is very good but adds little to the original and when it is flat dramatically, this becomes an issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the script is sharp, the songs enjoyable (not superb), the performances are top class (who know John Oliver would make such a great bird?). Ejiofor's Scar is superb, as is Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner. The leads - JE Jones, Donald Glover and Beyonce also acquit themselves well.

It felt just as powerful as it did in 1994. It's also visually stunning.  Besides that, it lacked what the original offered. Scar was more aggressive than satirical in this film. He felt very different than how he was in 1994. The biggest complaint is that lack of emotion that was shown in the Lions faces. For example, after Mufasa is trampled, McCrary does a decent job expressing the sadness in Simba's voice, but the Lion has a blank expression on his face. It takes away the power of the scene if Simba doesn't look upset about his fathers death. It's clear it's not possible to put such expressions on a \"life-like\" lion which is why the movie shouldn't have been made in the first place. Pumbaa and Timon kept their original personalities which was very reassuring. To sum this movie up in one sentence \"A beautiful movie isn't necessarily a good movie\" (3/5)",

As for the theater, we had the misfortune of sitting near a woman who insisted on loudly whispering to her child during the entire film claiming she had to do so and that it was a children's film. We only asked that she lower the volume, yet somehow she felt she had the right to impose her self righteous inconsideration on others. She went out to get a manager - wondered if she shouted at him that there was someone in the theater who dared wanting her to be quiet during the movie! We discussed the matter - he witnessed her loud whispering. He comp'd us tickets after the show. Oh well, the circle of going to the movies ...",

Most of the one-liners from the original film were missing and did not get replaced with something similar or better. \n\nPassing grade: Voice acting on the rest of the characters, Rafiki was good but could have been better.\n\nOverall it was a decent movie to watch, but it is better to wait until it comes out on DVD.

The decision to stick to realism robs the characters of the ability to emote and makes the voice acting feel ineffective and uncomfortable. The 2019 version is somehow a half an hour longer than the original and that is mostly due to ineffective storytelling. Finally, the biggest gripe that I have with this movie is that it reveals nothing more of the story that we've all seen and loved, it is almost a shot for shot remake of the original but with (truly breath taking and amazing) CGI. Not worth seeing, just watch the original for free on HBO. ",

I've seen a review that said the critic \"didn't feel connected\" due to the life-like realism of the animals. I find that very hard to believe unless the critic went into the movie not liking the idea that it's a remake from the start. If that were true, than the critic had a strong bias already. Another review somehow came to the conclusion that the technology controlled the movie. No, again: the animals and life-like appearance was realized by the audience from the start of the movie (assuming nobody in the audience saw any trailers beforehand). It was a very good balance of the technology combined with the voice acting that matched the animals brilliantly. I'd say 99% of the other children's movie reviews by those same critics would have some Debbie downer review to them as well. It's irritating to have to filter through reviews based on the validity of the reviews themselves. Hopefully, people check the audience reviews over the critics on this movie for that very reason.

The thing that drives this is the nostalgia, because without it, I don't think the movie would have done so well. \n\nI felt like it was missing someting. It did provide us with something new, as in new jokes, scenes and a new song, but it didn't evoke the same emotional response i get, when I watch the original. The animated animals, being as lifelike as they were, don't really articulate emotion very well (at least in my opinion). The infamous death of Mufasa fell kinda flat to me and this is a scene that always brings me to tears. There is a certain disconnect, when you can hear the sadness in Simbas voice, but the animation cannot show the despair in his face, which the original did very well. \n\nAnother thing, and this is probably just me, is that I couldn't differentiate between the different lionesses. If they didn't speak, Sarabi and Nala looked identical to me (but this is just nitpicking).\n\nI would have loved for this beautiful CGI, the great actors and the creativity to be used to tell a new story, instead of making a frame by frame repeat of what we've already seen.

Like 'The Jungle Book' and 'Aladdin', I was curious as to 1) how a live adaptation would look and 2) what changes would be made to make the story more interesting. On the first note, the film looked amazing. Seeing everything in live action made the viewing worthwhile. However, do not go into this movie expecting anything but a shot-for-shot remake. In fact, the minor changes that were made from the original, are to the detriment of the overall story. Some of my favorite shots from the animated version were missing, whereas others (pretty much the entire opening 'Circle of Life' scene) were exactly as you remember from the 1994 version. Bottom line, the animated version was much better and there was no need for this film if they were going to stick so close to the original. It was like seeing your favorite black and white comic redone by different artists in a color version that was not as good as the original. I walked away from this film thinking \"why\"? I will say, John Oliver, Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen were the stand out stars. They (along with the faux cinematography) made the movie worth seeing.",

Sure, you can complain that it's just a remake, or that live-action looking CGI animals talking loses the realness...but if you're here for realness, you're already in the wrong movie. I was going to give it 4 stars, but I'm going to go to 4.5 if only for Hans Zimmer's soundtrack. The biggest letdown musically for me was \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight?\" where Beyonce just sounds way too raspy for me. ",

The animals are rendered beautifully as well. The hair blowing in the breeze and the way they move is just spectacularly done. I also liked the re-interpretation and updates they did to some of the soundtrack music. I really enjoyed the cello and pipe solos in particular.\n\nHowever, as a movie, I was quite disappointed and even... bored. And I love the Lion King and the story line. Some of the voice actors seemed apathetic reading the lines, even James Earl Jones. I realize it can't be easy to redo lines, but he sounded like he had gotten stopped at a con and asked to say the lines for the 20th time that day. The kid actors' lines were cringy, and Timon and Pumba sounded like they were trying to rile up an unresponsive crowd. The animators made pretty much no effort to show emotion on the animal's faces. Simba looked the same when his dad died as when he was singing I Just Can't Wait to be King. I understand they were going for realistic and not cartoony, but my dog shows more emotion on a daily basis with ears and eyebrows and body language. It doesn't have to be human-ized to be emotional. The songs that we grew to love were shortened or talked through instead of sung. Be Prepared was the worst example of this. Also, with the award-winning Broadway show music right there why invent a new song for Simba to cross the desert to?\n\nAll together, this made for a movie that I was tempted to check my email and FB feed during. It just didn't capture and hold me like most movies do. My ten year old actually asked me \"How much longer?\" during Hakuna Matata. I've told my friends just to wait until it comes out on Netflix or whatever and don't waste your time seeing it in theaters.",

The lack of discernable emotion from any of the characters paired with genuinely good voice acting comes off as uncanny.

My wife also noticed two percieved \"woke\" moments that I was oblivious to. If you can explain that violence against bullies is wrong, and that a male lion could handle a clan of hyenas on his own your kids should be fine. Altogether, as with all the recent Disney remakes, it's okay, but nowhere near as magical as the original.",

The scenery and the fluid motion of the characters is jaw dropping throughout most of the movie. The acting staff did a fantastic job and managed to keep the film right in line with its past, but each gave it thier own unique spin. \n\nCons: Its really weired and slightly uncomfortable watching these realistic animals talking. Unlike the animated version, characters can be very hard to tell apart from each other, especially in the fight scenes. Some of the interpretations of the songs had to much done to them. The biggest con for me was Rafiki as he is one of my all time Disney favorites. They seemed to take away his playfulness. \n\nIt was an ok movie. I probably won't watch it again and stick with the classic animated version.",

A reboot will often have different stylisic elements and will attempt to distance itself from the previous film.\u201d  Jon Favreau and his team purposefully removed key parts (lines) of the movie that made the original so memorable. I also agree with the majority of the reviews I have read about casting big stars for the roles that do not require star power. And lastly - I really did try to enjoy the film but, Beyonce\u2019 voice over of Nala stuck out like a sore thumb. While there is nothing wrong with a southern drawl (I have one), as a trained actor/actress, you must be aware of your tone and how you pronounce certain words like \u201cyou\u201d.

I won't cover the story here because surely there is no one currently on planet Earth who does not know the story of The Lion King? However, I will say it's pretty much a scene by scene copy, with a few extra fillers to stretch the film out to it's 2 hour running time.  The screenplay has had some alterations but a lot of the classic and most memorable scenes are scripted the same with a few amusing nods to the original where the script has been updated slightly. \nVisually the film looks amazing and it is the realism that perhaps makes a couple of the scenes (hyenas in the elephant graveyard) a little scarier and perhaps not suitable for the really small people, and THAT scene in the gorge with the stampede is made a whole lot more emotionally gut wrenching. \nThe voice cast are all pretty good, the hyenas weren't as funny as the original and the \"ooh Mufasa, say it again\" line is missing which is pretty tragic but it's only a small quibble. Seth Rogan and Billy Eichner were perfect choice for Pumba and Timon but the big one, the main attraction of this piece is Scar.  No one was going to be able to live up to Jeremy Iron's brilliant mix of camp and cruelty and in Chiwetel Ejiofor's favour, he doesn't attempt to replicate that performance.  He puts his own spin on the character, Scar in this version is somewhat darker but still just as enjoyable, he is one of the greatest villains in cinema history and Chiwetel does a more than decent job of voicing the iconic baddie on the big screen.

Raffiky (appologies if misspelled) was a ruined for me as they removed most of his lines including the great life advice and his sense of humour about life and accepting the past. Why did they made this change? I assume some people found his humour a bit dark or lacking empathy for a kid's movie, and I guess it was a bit violent.\nThe rest of the movie story was almost the same with only minor changes in dialog. The previously implied relationship that scar had with the hyenas was not there making the turn against him at the end a bit more believable but made the alliance with him early in the movie less believable.\nOne thing that was done pretty well was the animal behaviours seemed more realistic, which makes sense considering disney's nature documentary projects and of course the graphics were pretty impresive.",

            "content": "\"Comparison is the thief of joy.\" - Theodore Roosevelt\n\nFirst of all, I am probably the biggest Lion King fan on this planet (self-proclaimed). I'm your typical '93 kid. Seeing my childhood memories coming to life and being recreated in a new and creative manner is something that I could never have dreamed of. When it comes to the Lion King, this was the live remake I was the most excited for.\n\nMy unpopular opinion: it was SUCH a great film. I went into the movie not expecting it to be exactly the same as the animation, and wanted to watch it as a film by itself. I went to go see it with an open mind. I did not want to watch it, and compare it to the original. I think that's the key in watching these remakes.\n\nOverall, most people seem to be critiquing (complaining about) the \"emotionless\" characteristics of the animals. Personally, it did not affect my viewing experience at all. One could still feel the emotion, and feel the mood of every scene. If the animals were portrayed any other way, it would have felt awkward and unnatural in the \"live world\" that the team created. Especially in the \"real life world\" - it would not have suit the narrative. If you wanted to see unnatural emotions and expressions, then rather go watch the animation again. The cinematography compensates for these \"lack of emotions\", and creates a beautiful atmosphere that pulls you right into the story.\n\nFor me, my only critique would be the character-design of Scar. I think that, visually, he wasn't up to scratch. The absence of his signature black hair and more prominent scar on the face made him fade a bit.\n\nAll in all, I was absolutely mind-blown, and I have already seen it twice. People were tearing up during the Mufasa scene. People were SINGING the songs they heard when they grew up. I was very pleased with this live adaption of The Lion King, and would advise everyone to go watch it for themselves, and appreciate the fine art that was created.",

If you want to see pretty animals go through the motions of the Disney classic, then this film is for you. The effects look amazing. But the \"realism\" works to it detriment. The emotion and heart in an animated move cannot be re-enacted with extremely photo realistic animals. The animals cant express facial emotion. Animals express emotion differently. I've never felt more cold during Mufasa's death because all the character's eyes are so dead. I'm sure the actors really tried, but when the voice comes out of expressionless faces, its for nothing. But even THATS tough because so many lines sound like the first take. \n\nIt felt like they deflated the big moments and focused too much on the little moments. The stampede never had the feeling of urgency like it did during animation. Rafiki never gives the lesson about learning from your past. But what do they focus on? The entire journey of Simba's hair to Rafiki, down to when its eaten by a giraffe, then cuts to the giraffes poop being rolled by a dung beetle. Why. All you had to do was carry his hair by the wind. Thats it.\n\nThe cherries on top that really disappointed me? The Hyena's werent funny. They turned \"Be Prepared,\" the one song I liked from the original, into a lazy spoken word poetry slam with a note that sounded liked Chiwetel Ejiofor had a couple of shots before the song (not the actors fault, this definitely sounds like a voice directing issue with the tone of the song). No Steam, no lights, no sense of rising power... just an old lion pacing back and forth on rocks. Beyonce's voice was distracting as hell, and I guess they spent the last of the budget getting Beyonce in the first place because they couldnt afford to show Mufasa in the clouds. Yeah. He's not there.ha\n\nWhat was good? Timon and Pumba. They actually were different enough to still be funny.",

While it might not entirely capture the feel of the original, it\u2019s a beautiful retelling if the classic story. ",

The last week before the release I watched an interview and he said that this is not a remake and he doesn\u2019t want people to think that, this is just a reimagining of a classic tale and this brightened my interest 10 fold. Now, it\u2019s not perfect, it is not better than the original but it is still enjoyable. There were some things that were taken out that I wish were in it, but what I couldn\u2019t get with was Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar. Chiwetel is one of my favorite actors and I\u2019m not sure, it just didn\u2019t mesh with me. He wasn\u2019t as menacing as he should be, he didn\u2019t seem as methodical, his look even wasn\u2019t as menacing as I feel it should. I know they probably wanted it to be different, they got James Earl Jones, I wish they could\u2019ve gotten Jeremy Irons for Scar. But I still really enjoyed it, I sang with a bunch of 7 year olds around me, I cried at the parts you cry at, and I enjoyed it fully.",

I grew up on that movie,  so this is from a true lion king fan.  I thought the cgi animation was spot on and truly captured what I would imagine lion king being in real world.  I love the subtle changes with today world kept in mind.  I only disliked that the voice for Napa was Beyonc.  No offense to Beyonc as she is queen B.  But her voice just sticks out like a sore thumb and we dont think Nala but we think Beyonc.  No fault but the glamour of Beyonc that people love.  She is not the best choice here but I love her soundtrack album the gift that includes songs in this movie.",

Even his life calling, for which he was blessed with amazing leadership abilities and creative talents to fulfill, was derailed. Finally, he forgot who he was.\n\nBut as the years have gone by, just as in the movie, he was reminded, \"Remember who you are.\" and take responsibility for your life and calling. Look to your duty, care for your family, and become a positive force in your community to protect and keep it strong.\n\nThrough the years I, too, have felt the discouraging forces of the world try to talk me out of my calling and purpose. Often times, I felt the voice of the King from Heaven say, \"Remember who you are. Remember who you are.\"\n\nThe Lion King story reminds us that life is not all, Hakuna Matata. We can run away from reality and try to ignore it, but at some point the inner complacency and outer spreading evil must be faced and dealt with.\n\nOpposing forces still try to hold my son at bay, but, I am happy to report the young prince is remembering who he is and is rising up to be the man he was meant to be.

The result of this remake is mixed. On one hand, the visuals are gorgeous. On the other hand, this remake doesn\u2019t add enough value to the original to justify its own existence.

You really feel like you are \"in\" the African savanna when you watch this in 3D and IMAX. As for the acting, I absolutely loved Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen as Timone and Pumbaa. They were hilarious and a wonderful throwback to the original beloved characters. Simba as a young cub was absolutely adorable. The songs as well were wonderful and Beyonc\u00e9's glorious vocals in songs like \"Can You Feel The Love Tonight\" and the new addition \"Spirit\" were emotional and empowering. Donald Glover is a great singer too and was a sympathetic adult Simba. And last but not least it was a treat having the great James Earl Jones back as Mufasa. The 1994 classic was perfection but this version holds its own too. ",

            "content": "First of all, a summary: The movie has stunning visuals (it is pretty much photorealistic), great voice actors (John Oliver as Zazu works especially well), the dialog is, in my opinion, a slight improvement over the original and the plot is unchanged from its great original. Hence the five-star rating.\n\nPlot and dialog: The movie follows the original almost scene for scene. There are slight changes to the dialog, which are an improvement in my opinion. There is a little more depth to the relationship between Scar and the hyenas, a lot more character for Shenzi, a little stronger comedy overall and more depth to the relationship between Scar and the other lions.\n\nAtmosphere: The atmosphere of the scenes is quite similar to the corresponding scenes in the original movie, so mostly lighthearted. There are the most differences when Scar and the hyenas are involved because these characters have become a little scarier and less goofy. The scene that involves Scar asking Zazu to sing songs to him is completely gone, instead, we have some new scenes of Scars rule that show his conflicts with the other lions and a dramatic scene that depicts Nalas escape from Scar and the hyenas to look for help (which leads to her finding out that Simba is alive). This is another example of Scar and the hyenas being portrayed as more threatening.\n\nVisuals: As said above, the visuals are absolutely stunning and the animals look almost photorealistic.  This makes scenes that live of their colorful depiction of Africa even more impactful. The one downside is, that the more realistic depiction of the lions and the hyenas makes it take half a second longer to tell whether the lion on-screen is Nala or Sarabi, or cub Simba or cub Nala, Shenzi or another hyena. After about a second it becomes clear though. Action and night scenes are a little more affected by this.\n\nMusic: The one area in which I consider the movie a slight downgrade. The great songs of the original movie are still played in this version, but I think the original has a better version of \"Be Prepared\" and slightly better singing in other songs. This might be just personal preference.",

One thing that infuriates me is how they changed scar, he was my favourite villian growimg up and they changed him into this flat character. Scar came across as cold and bland, whilst the original had a much more rounded and interesting personality. He had no nore sarcastic comment or posh like attidue; even the gyenas had lost their fun attitude. The worst character change was rafiki, he use to be this fun, a bit crazy old baboon and now, he has less personality that actual baboons. They cut scenes that were funny such has rafiki hitting simba on the end. Honestly i has to rewatch the orginal right after watching thw 2019 version to feel at ease again.",

I can't even say this was an 'okay' movie.. they cut scenes and added different ones that did nothing for the plot (SPOILER: the opening scene dragged out way too long, Be Prepared was shortened so much). They didn't add anything to the story, granted they did some re-writes that I approved of.. Some of the voice actors I liked for the rolls they did but others didn't seem to capture the emotion of the characters they were playing. Emotionless, Boring and all the old bonds no longer existed (SPOILER: Scar had with the hyenas it was not there, even though the hyenas were idiots in the original lion king, Scar was shown to have a bond with them) It added nothing but filler to pad the movie run time and I feel like my time was wasted on this movie. This movie just doesn't stand up.. Only reason it's getting 2 stars from me and not 1 star is for the okay acting cast plus how I loved the graphical look in it, that's the only thing they really nailed...",

The original Lion KIng was colorful uplifting, had great musical numbers, and had actors that fit the parts well. This one's a different story. Let's take a look. \nFirst: With animation the characters can cry and show emotion. That's how they made the buffalo stampede scene so emotional and dramatic. In this one you can't have live action animals show emotion (cry) so you don't get that same feeling when Simba's father dies. You feel the complete opposite. You almost tell Simba to deal with it. \nSecond: The actors added a lifeless voice contribution. Example: In the original the guy who played Timon the wisecracking weasle gave the character his humorous likeabilty. Whoever plays Timon in this debacle just didn't have the voice. He didn't give Timbone didn't have the comic persona. And overall just didn't sound like Timon. Seth Rogen i'll give credit. He was able to use his voice to sound close to the original Pumbaa. \nThird: The film's musical numbers were rushed and didn't have the upbeat originality of the predcessor. Mostly because of live action's lack of expression. Be Prepared is the most notable example. In the original the song is long, dramatic, and colorful. And it has all the colors, patterns, and dancing. With this one it's dark, Scar doesn't sound like he's singing and, it's very depressing and downbeat. \nFourth: In the orginal when Simba's dad comes in from the clouds and tells him who he is and what his destiny it's the most powerful part of the movie. And you can see him, so you get the full effect. In this one you can't see the father (all you see are a bunch of clouds that have a lion's face) and it doesn't have that impact. You feel unsatisfied. \nTo sum it up in a few short words it's dull, lifeless, lacks music and humor, and has cheesy special effects. Next time Disney! ",

The photorealism is incredible. Timon and Pumbaa always stole the show when they were on screen. They had energy and charisma and felt authentic. Beyonce's performance was fine, and actually outdid Donald Glover unfortunately. Scar was solid.\n\nTHE BAD: Songs were meh at best. Be Prepared was an utter failure. Can you Feel the Love tonight was too modern radio and didn't happen at night, so didn't make sense. Beyonce's song for Simba's return takes you out of a moment that should be emotionally fulfilling. Actually many places that should have been emotionally poignant fell flat throughout. \n\nOverall this film didn't bring enough new material to make it worthwhile in the long run. Sure it's fun to see what some of your favorite animated characters might look like together in nature, but that's about where it stops. It's virtually a strict retelling, and it does a good job of bringing the story to life, but in the end it's less compelling.",

And why is the audience score at the time of this review so high (88%)? Are people afraid of admitting it's awful? Do people at this time and age really think this passes for a 'good movie'?\nThe ORIGINAL Lion King is a masterpiece of animation and voice-acting and score and songwriting and storytelling. It's as close as it gets to being 'perfect'.\nThis 2019 remake is NOT anything of that. Sure, the photo-realistic scenery is impressive, from a technological point of view, but for all their realism there's something off with the way the animals move! On top of that, the animals are incapable of conveying emotion and expressions the way people or a cartoon can. Not even James Earl Jones can save it with his legendary voice-acting. Beyonc\u00e9 can't voice-act. I'm sorry, I love her, but voice-acting is not her cup of tea! That said, I think Donald Glover did make a better adult Simba; I always thought the original was a bit of a wuss, and Glover brings more authority to the character.\nThe movie is padded with 30 extra minutes of useless/lengthier scenes, and for all their amazing photorealism, couldn't they have had a more pretty Africa? The whole thing is in brown and earthen tones and I saw glimpses of the bloom that plagued videogames that claimed to be photorealistic a few years ago.\nTo me this is a movie that should never have been made.",

With the result looking amazingly real like an Attenborough documentary, the action sequences, which are now simply visceral and stunning to look at, benefit the most from this upgrade. However, when they start talking and singing, I feel as if I'm on a bad hallucinogenic trip, something The Jungle Book remake somehow managed to sidestep. While songs can be played out in the background, that's a lot harder to do for the talking, no matter how they try to soften them up with camera angles and editing that avoid showing mouth movements directly or for long periods of time. The main story and plotting and Elton John's songs remain so faithful to the original (film & Broadway show), it's like a scene-by-scene remake; and narrative developments are on the fast side, often at the expense of proper characterization. The voice cast reflects Disney's new found racial and cultural sensitivities (Donald Glover instead of Matthew Broderick; Chiwetel Ejiofor replacing Jeremy Irons), with the exception of a few white comedians sidekicks who are funny when they go a little off-script, but the personality of their voices are so distinctive, you still think of them more as Seth Rogen and John Oliver than Pumbaa and Zazu. This is Disney's third remake in a row since March's Dumbo and whilst their box office takings may have justify the exercise, you can't help but feel disappointed, if not despair, at the dearth of originality and you miss the original animation's charm and innocence. Sometimes just because you can, doesn't necessarily mean you should. ",

It makes the movie feel so rushed. Everything seems rushed. The singing is God awful, especially \"Be Prepared\". We don't see mufasa in the clouds, like wtf?! And then, to top it off, the overrated Beyonce gets a her own new song in the Lion King on Simba's travel back to the pride lands. Bullshit. They took all the well known actors of today, with a few exceptions, and totally disrespected the passion the went into the making of the original. Look at Disney, destroying childhood's left and right these days. They butchered this and as far as I'm concerned this live action remake doesn't exist. So thanks for nothing. You literally cannot beat the classics \u270c\ufe0f and don't out a beauty and the beast song in Lion King. Done.",

But I have to say that if I had not experienced the original in all its splendor, I might have not felt the same way. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but the music was not highlighted -- one of the best movie scores ever! And the animals, being done by computer (don't know the technology of this), lacked emotion.  Therefore, to me, it lost allot of the humor which made it so great (Nathan lane's timmone was priceless!) All in all, a great family movie night out, but for the generation who is being introduced to the Lion king with this movie, I suggest you get the original on demand to enrich your experience.",

They relied too heavily on beyonce over singing like she was trying to impress the judges at the voice, and donald glover trying his best, which was lack luster. Even john oliver lost points in my book for being associated with this at best fumble. It was overly safe and yet so self absorbed that it fails to capture even a moment of my attention.

Mufasa is king of pride rock and has a younger brother (Scar) who is technically next in line to be king. Mufasa has a cub (Simba) who is now the true successor to the throne. Scar tricks Simba into going to a dangerous place called the Elephant Graveyard, in hopes that he is killed by the denizens that live there. The plan fails when Mufasa gets there in time to save Simba and Nala (Female lion cub / Simba's friend). Scar then plots with the Hyenas to Kill Mufasa and Simba by creating a stampede using wildebeest. This plan only partially succeeds by killing Mufasa. Unknowingly to Scar, Simba manages to escape the hyenas and flees the pride lands. In the aftermath of Mufasa's death, Scar takes over as king. Simba is found by Timon and Pumba where they teach him that you can't change the past so don't worry about it (\"Hakuna Matata\"). Nala Escapes the pride lands to look for help because Scar and the Hyenas are destroying it. Nala eventually runs into Simba where she tries to convince him to come back and take his rightful place as king. He refuses. Rafiki soon after runs into Simba and, with the help from Mufasa teaches Simba you can't run from your past, you have to learn from it. Simba makes is way back to the pride lands where he challenges scar, learns the truth about his father's death and ascends as the new King. \nThe Lion King has all the chemical makeup for an excellent film and the remake keeps these attributes. I just wish they took advantage of this and expanded a bit more on the story.\n\nVisual: 4.5\nThe original film was an animation marvel, even by today's standard. Smooth animation bright and vibrant colors, expressive facial expression that mimic the voice actors, and the illusions of real-life camera work / tricks. \nThe 2019 version of the film is no slouch on the eye candy. The hyperrealism makes the film look like a Nat-Geo documentary. If you thought the CGI in the Jungle Book remake was stunning, you haven't seen anything yet. \nWhile the visuals pretty much make every other CGI animated film look last gen, there is one thing that kinda sticks out. Part of what made the classic Lion King animation stand out is the expressiveness through body language and facial expression. If you are looking for that this time around you will be fresh out of luck. Besides mouth moving while talking and singing, these cats look and act like, well\u2026 Big cats. Its just part of the deal, Jon Favreau and Disney were clearly going for \"What If\" The Lion King happened on Planet Earth. \n\nAudio: 4\nThere is no denying that the 1994 cast would be just about impossible to live up to, and honestly it was. Don't get me wrong though, the cast for the 2019 film is still amazing, and well done. I think the approach this time was to interpret the characters your own way, and all of them did a pretty good job at it. James Earl Jones is the only original cast member to reprise his role and he was brilliant. JD McCrary played young Simba and was great. He performed the number \"I just can't wait to be king\" and he did it better than the original if you ask me. Also his after the stampede / Mufasa Death scene was heart wrenching. Maybe even more than Johnathan Taylor Thomas's performance. Chiwetel Ejiofor played a good Scar but Jeremy Irons left some huge shoes to fill. I think I will have to say Jeremey had the better performance. Beyonc\u00e9's Nala was on point. I was a little nervous that she would be too much Beyonce if that makes any sense. Donald Glover also had some big shoes to fill. Every movie Matthew Broderick played in his voice just screams Simba to me, but I have to admit I love Glover's interpretation of the character. It feels like a up dated version of the original. They made the right choice going with Childish Gambino because he can sing. His rifting at the end of \"Hakuna Matata\" was pure gold and he was getting better and better. I hated the song had to end. Much like Donald Glover, Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner are like updated versions of the originals. Ernie Sabella, and Nathen Lane are Pumba and Timon. In my opinion, and Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner feels the same.\nSoundtrack wise The Lion King 2019 is once again a masterpiece. Hans Zimmer pretty much just bedazzled his work and, its music to my ears. If the original score made you feel like the orchestra is playing in the same room as you, the new and improved version puts you right were the conductor is standing and you are surrounded by blends of harmonies and melodies. \nBeyonc\u00e9 and Donald Glover lend their voices to the movie classic \"Can You Feel The Love Tonight\" and it came out very well done. I prefer it over the original movie version. I have to admit that Disney did miss an opportunity though, I would have loved to here a Beyonce Rendition of \"Shadowland\". The new song \"Spirit\" is pretty good though and made it into the film.  \n\nFinal Thoughts \nThe Lion King 2019 is a great film, not perfect\u2026  but these remakes usually aren't. Most of its bigger faults I was capable of getting over by being immersed by photorealism and Hans Zimmer's intoxicating score. A lot of critics of the film state not being about to get past the lack of facial expression. The thing is Jon Favreau / Disney wanted to go with the Hyper realism and in reality big cats don't have facial expression so it would look really unnatural or comical (think Alex The Lion from the Madagascar Series). They also complained that it was basically a prettier carbon copy or the original. To me that's more of a complement because the 1994 classic is one of the greatest animated films period. I still have to admit that I would have liked them to expand on character interactions more. It felt like the moment I warm up to Donald Golver's Simba he was already running back to the pride lands. I feel like they should have done something similar to what they did in The Lion King 1 \u00bd where they added scenes. \nOverall II highly recommend seeing the film. Ignore the critics especially if you enjoyed the original movie. \n\n\nScore: 84\n",

The facial expressions may not have been as vivid as the cartoon animated version, but that's because this is a live-action film. It would be outrageous to nitpick over such a thing. You could still see emotion on the characters faces, especially in their eyes. It was enjoyable for all ages. Three generations of my family enjoyed the movie.

The beginning till the last 15 minutes could have been summarized in 20 minutes, and about half the movie was all about passing the time instead of advancing the plot. It ended in the most cliche way imaginable. Also I really think the type of animation they used was incredible but placed in the wrong movie.

New voice actors can't hold a candle to the originals, bringing back James Earl Jones was all they got right. Music also falls extremely short of the original.

The CGI is amazing for a few minutes but it doesn't help the movie overcome it's major problem: lack of emotion. Despite using the same story this adaptation failed to capture the sadness and sense of triumph the original did, which left me walking out of the movie disappointed. In conclusion, The Lion King is a aesthetically pleasing remake that doesn't add anything to the storyline and loses the emotions that made the original film great. ",

The chemistry was touch and go throughout the movie that made it seem very awkward- not at all natural.  The cast of voices- while very talented were poorly selected, or terribly executed- as if they worked as individuals and not together.\nJD McCrary did a very good job as young Simba but some of the innocence that was brought to the animated role by Jonathan Taylor Thomas was lost. \nSeth Rogen did really well as Pumba and James Earl Jones is an irreplaceable voice- they were my only real joy. \n\nThe worst part was the remake of \"Can you feel the love tonight\" a lovely song turned into a competion of vocals- like nails on a chalkboard.\nBeyonce's voice is absolutely beautiful as is Donald Glover's voice- but not together and not for this song. Maybe take a lesson from the original or even the Pentatonix cover of how voices should work together in a duet.\n\nMy hope is that Disney fixes the awkward and does a re-release.",

I cried when Mufasa died, I held my daughter tight while looking at the star filled sky, and I cheered when Simba realized his true destiny! What else could one ask from this film? I even liked the fact that the storyline did not venture far from the original narrative. I thought the actors did exceedingly well bringing these beloved characters to life and that Beyonce brought out a brave, strong and fierce Nahla. The iconic voice of James Earl Jones was amazingly still as powerful and resonant as it was all those years ago, and I was as enthralled as I was then. Some complain that they miss the facial expressions from the original; but c'mon...it was an animated, cartoon. How deeply were we really connecting to facial expressions? Although it was CGI, it was done so well it actually felt more authentic in some ways. I thought the very real look of the animals enhanced the beautiful story in all its nuances. A resounding bravo to all involved in bringing this treasure back in such an awesome way!",

Sometimes it's nice not being spoon-fed everything\nThose really important moments in the movie (such as Rafiki discovering Simba is alive) don't seem to carry the same weight that they did in the first movie leaving you feeling underwhelmed",

Do you know why a lot of people are bothered by this version? Because it is basically a word for word, shot for shot remake, and there was so much of a disconnect and lack of emotion. Why even do a remake? How difficult is it to convey the same emotion from the original? Apparently very. How is it possible to have James Earl Jones not sound powerful when speaking? He's the same person who voiced Mufasa all those years ago. So how is that possible? (None of these negative things are the actors/actresses faults btw.) \n\n The good part about this though is the visuals. It is absolutely beautiful.

Also, there is this weird small talk crap that just adds fluff and interrupts the timing of the movie, it completely pulls you out of the scene (if you're actually able to engage). I don't understand why some shots are modern carbon copies of the original but the voices of some characters are so ordinary that you wouldn't be able to differentiate one from another. This is so bad that I won't be seeing any of these other remakes that Disney has decided to subject the world to.

Apparently the director wanted to show emotion only through body language, which he failed at, and told the voice actors to tone it down. This resulted in an almost emotionless movie. I am very familiar with cats, both wild and domestic, and they show a lot more emotion than what we see in this movie. Watch the eyes and ears, the whiskers and mouth. Very little emotion is conveyed, even though felines naturally have very expressive faces. The voice acting is a bit flat, even Mufasa! Beyonce is NOT a voice actor. Poor casting. I've always loved Sarabi, even though she is a minor character, but she was ruined in this movie. At one point she says she isn't scared of Scar.. I know she isn't. But SHOW, don't TELL. We don't SEE how regal she is, you only know she is the queen because the camera focuses on her.",

I noticed a few small scenes they took away, which could of gave it a little more humor like the original. Rafiki did not have a big impact in the movie as I always thought. Beyonce was okay as Nala, JUST OKAY. It was a good movie, but the original will ALWAYS triumph over the remake. Nice try.",

Mind you, I was not there for the original Lion King when it came in theaters in June of '94 because when I was one year old I would stay with family and watch educational programs/channels on TV. But somewhere near '99 or 2001, I was able to watch Lion King on VHS at my elementary school. Movie-wise I like both versions of The Lion King equally and just the same; music is the same. I was also there for the 3D Lion King when it came out in 2011. Either way, animation was spot-on with both versions; storyboard made sense; loved the music.

Then the scene in which Simba is supposed to see his dad in the clouds was cut out and normal clouds were show instead, which completely killed the atmosphere and importance of that scene. We don't see Simba falling down in those flowers and all the scenes when he's trying to figure out who he is. All of the character development was thrown away to make room for cheap gags. The expository shots are way longer than they need to be but the really important shots for when Simba reunites with Nila and them falling in love are cut waaaaay too short.

            "content": "All my life, The Lion King was my favorite Disney movie and still is to this day. I've always anticipated what a \"live action\" version of this story would be like. Perhaps I should've stuck with the original and no remakes\u2026\nThis movie is a visual achievement and there Is no denying it. The animals all look photo realistic even though they are 100% CGI. For the most part, this movie was the movie I wanted to see. It is almost quite literally a shot for shot remake of the Lion King which I loved. This didn't change big parts of the story like Aladdin did and it stayed very faithful to the original. Some of the shots they recreated put big smiles on my face and made me reflect a lot on my childhood. It was great to listen to James Earl Jones again as Mufasa and Seth Rogen as Pumba was fantastic casting. This movie gave me the story I wanted to see and the one that I know and love. This movie gave me the fleshed-out characters that I know and love. Unfortunately, it lacked any and all of the energy and emotion that the first one had.\nOne of the biggest positives of this film, was also its biggest issues. The photo realistic design of these animals is truly incredible and what the effects crew did with that was terrific. But, with the animals looking so real, it takes away expression and emotion which brings me to my next problem. I don't know if the voice actors are to blame, or if they were just given dialogue and told not to have much emotion behind their voice because this film, felt soulless. In the original, Mufasa's death was a horrifying and sad scene to witness. Scar lived in the moment and cherished his opportunity to kill his brother and you could feel the tension in his menacing voice. As Mufasa fell to his death, we saw the true horror in Simba's face as his dad died before his eyes. In this movie, Simba just looked like a baby lion roaring and sounded like a kid who dropped his ice cream on the ground. That's just one example among an entire 118 minute runtime. Somethings about the original that they changed were completely nerfing Raficki. He wasn't even close to being as good as he was in the original. He was just bland, humorless, and seemed to not care that Mufasa and Simba were both dead. All of the songs felt empty and bland ESPECIALLY be prepared which was heavily nerfed. I'm also confused as to why they didn't recast Jeremy Irons as Scar because I'm sorry, Chiwetel Ejiofor didn't do it for me as Scar. Shall I even say that James Earl Jones even felt tired delivering some of his lines as Mufasa. But again, who do I blame? The too good CGI or the voice acting? Also some of the stuff they added did nothing new for the story. There's an extended scene of Nala sneaking out of pride rock to get help and it goes on waaay too long. There's also an extended scene of Timon and Pumba singing \"The lion sleeps tonight\" which while charming, it wasn't necessary. I would've preferred that we get some back story on Scar on how he got the scar in the first place as he mentions early in the film. That would've filled the runtime so much better in my opinon.\nAs you can see this film frustrated me very much. Although there is a lot to like in this movie, that being the characters and the story and visuals, but it all feels so empty. Disney went 0 for 3 this year with live action and after messing up Aladdin and The Lion King, two favorites of mine, I say Disney should call it quits with these movies. But hey, they've both made over 1 billion dollars so unfortunately, we will continue to get more of these shameless cash grabs. The Lion King ever so disappointingly gets, a C+\n",

However, at the end of the day it falls under the category of \"their animators were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.\" Hete are 10 Reasons, in no particular order, why you shouldn't fork over your hard earned moneys to watch the new photorealistic remake of Lion King:\n\n1. It's photorealistic which means you'll quickly come to the realization that irl animals have very limited range of facial expressions, unlike a cartoon where, regardless of species, you can clearly tell how a character is feeling through exaggerated features. So basically Simba has the exact same f***ing expression(pictured above) when he's palling around with Nala as he does when he's mourning over the loss of Mufasa's dead ass. Moreover, as you may or may not have noticed, animals don't usually dance and prance around in nature so a musical number such as \"I just can't wait to be king\" is just way less fun\n2. Apparently Chiwetel Ejiofor is too cool to sing, so my personal favourite musical number \"Be Prepared\" was replaced by a little recruitment seminar\n3. No luau Timon.\n4. Everything is the same as the original but worse.\n5. You can use the money you would have used to watch this to buy a DVD/Blu-Ray version of Lion King 1994 and have a much better time\n6. All the characters are devoid of personalities because, once again, irl animals have very limited range of facial expressions, so at any given moment whenever two characters are interacting with each other without the presence of dialogue it just seems like they're blankly staring at each other. What's that Simba, you're thinking about boning Nala later? Couldn't tell, cuz you're a f***ing lion who's incapable of conveying emotions through your face\n7. So I read this article which said that lions that have darker manes are typically more masculine because the darker manes are caused by extra testosterone pumping through their bodies and so they're usually more physically endowed thereby considered the alpha of their respective prides and to account for this it looks like they made scar's mane lighter? Idk it might just be me, I read this like 5 mins before watching the movie and it may have skewed my perception a tad. \n8. The once malicious, conniving Shakespearean villain that was Scar has been rendered a bland, soulless echo of his former self because of, you guessed it, the limitations of photorealism\n9. It's not even live action like the other remakes. Everything was done in a computer anyway, so like, what even is the point? \n10. Stop encouraging Disney to make more of these by giving them your money. THEY ARE RELEASING 4 LIVE ACTION REMAKES IN 2019 ALONE AND THEY MUST BE STOPPED\n\nEnjoy the rest of your day :)",

Timon and Pumba are excellently casted, and from a comedic perspective this remake does very well. However, there are distinct lacking moments, including the remake of Be Prepared, one of my personal favorite musical numbers from the original, where you cant help but be confused and/or cringe. Animation quality was spectacular in my opinion. Overall, not the worst Disney remake by a long shot, but I wouldnt see it again.",
