            "content": "\"Ip Man 4\" is a martial arts film that lives up to the hype and exceeds expectations. It is the fourth and final installment in the Ip Man franchise, and it is undoubtedly the most impressive.\n\nFirstly, the action scenes in Ip Man 4 are breathtaking. The fight choreography is spectacular, and it is evident that the filmmakers spared no expense in making the fights look as authentic and realistic as possible. Every move and strike is meticulously executed, and the fight scenes are both intense and exciting to watch.\n\nSecondly, the film has a strong narrative that explores themes of family, loyalty, and cultural identity. The story revolves around Ip Man, a martial arts master who travels to San Francisco to find a school for his son. Along the way, he becomes embroiled in a conflict between Chinese and American martial arts practitioners, and he must fight to defend the honor of his country and his culture.\n\nThirdly, the performances in the film are outstanding. Donnie Yen delivers an exceptional performance as Ip Man, bringing a depth and nuance to the character that is both captivating and emotional. The supporting cast also delivers strong performances, particularly Scott Adkins as the villainous Barton Geddes.\n\nOverall, Ip Man 4 is an amazing film that lives up to the hype. It is a must-watch for fans of martial arts movies, but it is also a film that can be enjoyed by anyone who appreciates a well-crafted and engaging story. It is a fitting end to the franchise, and it is a film that will be remembered as one of the best martial arts movies of all time.",

            "content": "Minha opinião: Aqui termina esta saga de Ip Man, o mestre de @brucelee o maior lutador de #kungfu com seus filmes que ecoam até os dias de hoje. Estes 4 filmes foram bons que conseguiram contar cada etapa da vida Ip. Que sempre teve os seus desafios de ter de lutar para continuar. Com sua técnica #wingchun Aqui neste 4º filme lembra o mesmo estilo do 1º, porém agora passa em São Francisco. Onde tem que provar para os mestres a sua competência. Porém agora tem um agravante que seu aluno Bruce, que a comunidade chinesa, não aprova ele ensinar kung-fu para ocidentais. Além que Ip vai para EUA para conseguir matricular seu filho. Nisso ele precisa de uma carta da comissão chinesa. Na escola Ip protege Vanda que é filha Wu. Ai a salda esta feita. KKKKK. Sem falar em Vanness que é um soldado do exercito americano que quer introduzir Kung-Fu nas forças armadas. E acaba em conflito com seu superior que o arrogante e preconceituoso Scott e seu capatas Chris que são faixa preta em karate. E a cereja do bolo Ip esta com câncer terminal. Com tudo isso sabemos que é um filme cheio de porrada e muita ação do inicio ao fim. Ahhhh tem ainda o comandante da alfandega. Com tudo isso temos muita ação e até tempo para o drama de relacionamento entre pai e filhos. Lutas bem coreografadas, boa atuação dos atores. Ênfase a Vanda e Scott. Creio que fecharam com chave de ouro a série e trazendo o lendário Bruce Lee. Parabéns.\nRoteiro e enredo bem elaborados, apesar de ter várias estórias se cruzando.\nVale apena assistir? Sim recomendo.\nNota: 9",

Ip Man 4 followed the same simplistic recipe, making it entirely predictible. The combat scenes are entertaining, but less so than in previous episodes. What struck me in Ip Man 4 is the sheer volume of the anti-white/anti-Western message (all white americans being petty/evil racists, while the only black american that is not a bystander is good and generous), which morphs the movie into a facile and weirdly caricatural propaganda piece.

Compared to the U.S., Chinese people have flourished and have been able to preserve their ancient culture, quiet the contrast when comparing to the horrendous events, such as the Chinese Civil War with it is deaths of tens of millions, as the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, which resulted in the deaths of around 50 million to 75 million people, and let us not forget the massacre at Tiananmen Square in 1989, the persecution of Tibetan monks, the Dalai Lama, state-controlled media, etc. There is no doubt that Chinese immigrants had faced racial discrimination, such as the Chinese Exclusion Act, but to have the teenage Chinese girl being bullied and her say \"Real Americans are Indians, your ancestors stole this land\", is both historically inaccurate and hypocritical.",

None of the sequels to the Martial Arts masterpiece Ip Man have been able to equal it, let alone surpass it.  Thankfully, 'The Finale' does a pretty good job of ending this franchise on a high note.  Sure, I wish 'Bruce Lee' had played a more significant role in the film, some of the acting is iffy, and like the sequels to the original, this one has some fight choreography that is no doubt impressive but nonetheless too unrealistic and over-the-top compared to the original's more grounded believable combat sequences.  As expected, there are Kung Fu cinema cliches in certain parts of this film which were kind of laughable at times too.  Still, the overall package was of satisfaction for me.  It retains the epic soundtrack, entertaining action, Donnie Yen's compelling character, good messages and nice lighting/cinematography.",

            "content": "Martial arts movies are too often evaluated against the genre only and not more generally in regard to film standards.  That may be understandable in some ways but is insulting to the genre and to intelligent viewers. The Ip Man finale has much in common with the previous three films in the Ip Man series, yet there's something disappointing about it nonetheless.  Donnie Yen delivers another strong, nuanced performance as the venerable and dignified Ip Man, the cinematography and direction are excellent, the choreographed fight scenes are creative and skillfully done, and the story finds a moral worthy of ancient wisdom without seeming excessively canned or corny.  \n\nUnlike so many other martial arts films, the Ip Man series tries to create a compelling story and not rely so heavily on fantasy fights one after the other.  But somewhat like its predecessors in the series, \"Ip Man 4\" posits the most one-dimensional villains so there's not enough nuance to the conflicts of culture, social status, or personal integrity.  The bigotry and arrogance of American culture and white men in power is also overdone, though not without some justification. In this installment, the villains are so irredeemably vile, loud and obnoxious that they seem cut out of bad superhero comics.  It's too easy to hate them, and their values are never worthy of a second thought compared with those of Ip Man. \n\nWhat matters more in these films is the internal conflict between factions of the Chinese martial arts community, which inevitably find resolution through the force of Ip Man's dignified and heartfelt dedication to a greater good of overcoming bias and intolerance.  Sadly, there's also an intensified Chinese nationalism, something that pervaded the earlier films but has become downright militaristic in the fourth installment.  In a different twist, the filmmakers also introduce a new theme—the challenge of dealing with a rebellious teen.  \n\nBased loosely on the life of the real Ip Man and his prominent role in advancing Wing Chun kung fu, these films have set a standard, even with their often simplistic moral conflict.  Donnie Yen has been masterful in the role, and he will be missed as he shifts back to what I feel sure will be less restrained and thoughtful martial arts stories helmed by less refined directors than Wilson Yip.",

This installment has Ip Man journeying to San Francisco to explore the possibility of his son going to school there.  Here's where I deviate into feeling frustrated with this movie.  Have you seen Rocky 4?  Rocky 4 was entertaining, but it was also blatant propaganda.  AMERICAN GOOD GUY, underdog, virtuous, fair and RUSSIA BAD GUY, cheater, villain.  My frustration with Ip Man 4 had to do with the characterization of Americans as racist. This was overplayed to such an extent that it was downright repugnant.  Another thing, the acting by the American characters felt very amateurish.  This is a frequent shortcoming of movies coming out of China(where so many wonderful movies have been made), but these scenes with English speakers portraying Americans were really so poorly acted and directed that it is worth mentioning.  I wish I could have liked this more, but it was shamelessly propagandized.",

            "content": "I have a been a huge fan of the Ip Man series ever since the first movie came out in 2008. I watched all of the films in the series including the spinoff \"Master Z: Ip Man legacy\". So, of course, I was going to go see this movie as well, especially considering its the last one in the main Ip Man films. Unfortunately, I came out feeling very disappointed in this movie.\n\nLet's start with the positives. The first and probably the reason most people come to watch this film is the fight scenes. They are still very well choreographed and this iteration features a variety of different type of martial arts including western Karate. Seeing how they choreographed different fighting styles. The fighting is also fast-paced and stylistic. The second has to be Donnie Yen's marvellous performance as the titular character Ip Man. He continues to embody the character perfectly and give a convincing dialogue as a man with many wisdom. Likewise, I also have to praise Wu Yue as Wan Zong-Hua (chairman of the Chinese Benevolent Association) for providing a contrasting character to Ip Man belief but still give that aura of wisdom. Danny Chan returns as Bruce Lee from Ip Man 3 and he is still great and resembles him. The score from Kenji Kawai returns and is also still really good at elevating every scene albeit it is still kinda similar to that of all the previous entries.\n\nNow let's get to all the negatives from this film. Firstly, while I did praise the fights and its choreography; it's not very memorable. Each film tends to have one or multiple fights that stick in your mind: The first film had the fight against 10 Japanese karate fighters, the second with the fish market fight and the table fight and the fight against the boxer, the third film with the fight against Mike Tyson and the final fight. However, the fights in this film don't come close to the memorable fights of previous films. The closest it gets is maybe the Ip man vs Wan Zong-Hua or the Ip Man vs Scott Adkins (can't even remember his character's name…). Even those fights feel short and underwhelming at points. Secondly, why is every character in this film also borderline cartooney? There have been some over the top characters in previous entries but it was usually just one for comic relief but in this film, it feels like apart from the three characters I listed above; everyone else is over the top. This blend of serious performances from some actors with the over the top from others is very jarring. For example, Scott Adkins plays this over the top racist general but he is so blatantly racist and acts like a stereotypical general that it makes you wonder how he was even employed. Thirdly, the story is atrocious and lacks any nuance or depth. The story is simply Ip Man goes to America to get his son a school there and some weird racist stuff happens with Bruce Lee doing just kind of being there. The message in this film is, of course, exploring racism and they do kind of try to make it subtle with Bruce Lee who trains western people despite criticism from the Chinese people. HOWEVER, they waste Bruce Lee in this film by not even remotely having him involved in the main plot! He could have been used to show that it was possible for acknowledgement between Chinese and western people but they don't even utilise this. Instead, we got over the top racist people trying to get rid of all Chinese people and prove Kung fu sucks so Ip Man has to stop him and convince some people otherwise. Due to them not utilising Bruce Lee more, the message of this film ends up feeling like western people are racist and bad even though this contrast Bruce Lee and even Ip Man point within this film. It doesn't feel like a necessary story to tell for Ip Man with only a couple of things adding to his character like cancer and filming his training I guess? Also, this racist thing has already been done in Ip Man 2 so it is weird they are doing it again even if it explored slightly better. It just feels like similar ground and too much of a retread. Additionally, they decide to up the melodrama with all these family drama that really feels like they were trying to force some kind of character development. \n\nOverall, this film is a disappointing entry with its huge waste of story potential. However, the movie retains a lot of what makes IP Man a great martial art movie. The grounded, brutal yet fluid realistic fights are still there and are still great as always. The fluid interplay between contrasting martial arts are still great. Donnie Yen continues giving a wised yet graceful performance as the titular character with an elegant yet ferocious fighting style. Additionally, the last 15-20 minutes of this movie is very thrilling and also a very satisfying conclusion to the legacy of this franchise. In the end, this movie still provides fans with what made them fall in love with this franchise in the first place and sticking to its strengths still makes for a very good time.",

This film lacks any subtlety - the racist name calling, the white vs. yellow rivarly is all very brazen which renders them emotionless. I didn't feel much for the characters' pain except for one scene involving a Chinese school girl being bullied. All the non-Chinese actors overacted; there is a reason why some of them have featured only as extras or stunt coordinators - they cannot act. Even the British boxer from Ip Man 2 acted better than any of the non-Chinese cast. Also, the action choreography was fast but not stylish like previous movies - just punches and kicks flying everywhere without much finesse. Bruce Lee's fight sequence in the beginning is great but lacks emotional appeal - it's out of nowhere and only meant to cash in on his name without adding anything to the plot. But kudos to the actor who mimicked his movements (shifting stance, rubbing his nose with his thumb etc.) and signature sounds. Boss fight at the end extremely underwhelming - Mike Tyson carried more gravitas than him!!! Disservice to Ip Man to end his legacy with this film, could have been much better.",

After the movie when I saw the film got a 94% on Rotten Tomatoes I couldn't figure out why. Then when I realized the audience could also experience the movie in other languages, I thought that could explain it. The movie in English is ridiculous. In another language where you don't realize how unnatural the dialogue is and how over the top the acting is I get how you can be seduced by the good fight scenes.

Placing the movie in San Fran allows for some interaction with Ip Man's most famous pupil, Bruce Lee which allows for bonus fun in the form of what can be seen as a response to QT's presentation of Bruce Lee in Once Upon a Time In Hollywood in the form of Danny Chan Kwok Kwan as Bruce Lee) taking on a group of American martial artists that don't respect his fighting style.

Great Artists to demonstrate tenge daughter scenes and choreography of Donnie Yen and others to make this movie possible! Truly a privilege to be a student of the arts and it’s bcuz of those that went against stigmas and styreotypes and embraced all cultures to be indulged i into the art study of self defense.

That was some top tier acting.\n\nYou get emotionally invested in certain characters like the little girl.\n\nBruce Lee was pretty good but could have been more \"brucelee-esque\"\n\nThe bad:\nMost of the side characters are incredibly one dimensional and did little to advance the plot. Its a joke that the random gunnery sergeant can whoop the ass of like 10 kungfu \"masters\" lol.\n\nLike the above point the power scaling was so warped i had trouble enjoying the fights.\n\nLarge supporting characters were not given wins to cement certain character development and the racist taichi master did not become any less racist LOL.\n\nDonnie Yen is always the one saving the day. Its painful and completely worn out.\n\nI'm not sure if its propoganda but every white person was racist and pure evil.\n\nTL;DR\nIt has its moments but the writer could have done a much better job.

If you care for storyline, dialogue, attention to detail and acting that’s somewhat convincing, that is where this movie falls short. The storyline is pretty much a complete copy/paste of Ip Man 2. I’ll leave it at that to avoid spoilers, but it’s annoying to me that the writers couldn’t really think outside the box on storyline for the final film. The dialogue is cringeworthy and the anti-Asian racism is wholly unconvincing almost laughable in some scenes. Lastly, some aspects of the film just didn’t quite make sense. For instance, the story has a drill instructor who’s completely unwilling to implement the vastly inferior Chinese Kung Fu into the U.S. Marine training program (presumably due to anti-Asian racism), yet shills Karate (A Japanese martial art) like it’s the AMERICAN way. Also, who’s idea was it to cast a half white actress to play the daughter of a Kung Fu master who resents whites? Some of the choices for this movie are just laughable. Thankfully, I came for the fighting scenes and for Donnie Yen, neither of which disappointed. ",

The sound fx, camera movement, and over all perfection. Not like most of the action movies, they intend to use a lot of montages to divide a movement into several pieces, cheated with shaking, close up, and unnecessary slow motion to present powerful action. The actions in this movie are so clear as IP Man series always do, and the hype is in the peak. Surprisingly, there is a female master called Jiang who uses Xingyi fighting style. This is the first time I saw this style present in a movie. The combat is incredible, it is like something you haven't seen before(completely out of mind). unfortunately, according to the story she is just a supporting role for building up emotional atmosphere, I hope she can fight longer or considering make another movie which focus on Xingyi would be epic XDXD",
