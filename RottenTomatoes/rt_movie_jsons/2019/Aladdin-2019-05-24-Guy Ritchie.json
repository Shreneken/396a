Special acknowledgments given to the screenplay for giving Jasmin such huge balls, that I feel was missing in the animation take. Saluting the talents of Ritchie, Smith and newcomers Massoud and Scott, this version (although slightly deviating from the original) still holds a punch!",

I am happy that Jasmine got her own song and her independence, but I am not a fan of all of the women's right movements pushed into a film that was supposed to be based on Aladdin, I understand that she is empowering, and she's by far my favorite. But at the end of the day the movies are exactly what they were created for and that's where we need to stick, we don't need to change things because the world besides, the things need to be different, we create new movies for those, we don't destroy old movies because of peoples ignorance.",

The costumes are great and there are some good examples of CGI. I liked the chase scene near the start, with fast choreography, it felt almost a little like a fast chase scene from a James Bond film. I would say that it's not the kind of film to overly analyse - if you're going to do nothing but compare it to the cartoon version from the 1990s, then you might well find some flaws but as a family-friendly film in its own right and for a light entertainment type watch, its certainly pretty good in and of itself.\nI found it to be quite atmospheric and engrossing and while its undoubtedly cheesy, it's a good example of a family-friendly musical/fantasy film and so I'd definitely recommend it.",

            "content": "Am a huge Disney fan and have been for pretty much my whole life, 'Cinderella', 'Peter Pan' and 'The Lion King' being my first Disney films (still love all three, especially 'The Lion King'). 'Aladdin' is one of my favourites from them as well as being one of my favourite animated and even overall films. Great animation, songs, characters and one of Disney's best voice acting performances ever in Robin Williams. Will admit to not being overly excited hearing that there was going to be a live-action remake and was a bit mixed on the trailer.\n\nHave nothing against remakes, or at least try not to, and have liked a few of Disney's previous live-action remakes. The best being 'The Jungle Book' and 'Cinderella'. Will Smith when he has good material is a likeable actor and still have fond memories of watching 'The Fresh Prince of Bel Air' when younger. Although not a fan of Guy Ritchie, there is no bias against him either. Decided to see 'Aladdin' with mixed expectations, due to being such a big fan of Disney and after hearing from a few friends that it was good.\n\nDo sadly have to agree with those that were disappointed and this is even when judging 'Aladdin' (2019) on its own merits. There is a lot of spectacle and most of it is great, but the magic and soul were missing. Again, like as was said for the recent version of 'The Lion King', there has always been an effort to not excessively compare and judge something on its own, but when one version is so great and another fails badly in comparison it is hard not to.\n\nThere are good things with 'Aladdin'. Although very Bollywood-ish (am not saying that as a bad thing, just an observation), the costumes and sets are big, colourful and quite lavish. Some of the photography dazzles. The music that still has the involvement of Alan Menken, songs and score (the music being one of the main reasons as to why the animation is the classic that it is), is a sheer delight. The likes of \"Friend Like Me\" and \"A Whole New World\" being classics. Here the older songs are re-worked and there are a couple of new ones, complete with some equally dynamic new scoring. \"Friend Like Me\" and \"A Whole New World\" are very nicely done, and also really liked the more ambitious re-working of \"Arabian Nights\" and \"Speechless\" (the better of the two added songs) adds such a lot to Jasmine's character.\n\nReally liked what was done with Jasmine's character, who is by far the most interesting and most developed character in the film and her development is richer than in the animated films. The performances were mixed, with Naomi Scott sparkling like a true diamond as Jasmine and Will Smith makes a very game and spirited effort filling giant shoes and brings a lot of charisma and freshness to Genie. Mena Massoud isn't as strong but is appealing as Aladdin.\n\nHowever, Guy Ritchie came over as the wrong director. Did think even hearing about it that he was a strange and potentially disastrous choice for the job and his style just doesn't gel and was in serious need of more subtlety. There is some dazzling photography but too much of it is a bit too overblown and gimmicky. The film could have done with having fewer special effects and they tend to not be all that great, felt even from the trailer that Genie looked weird and my feelings haven't changed. The script could have done with more freshness.\n\nFor me too the story was in need of more charm, energy and soul. It doesn't quite suffer as badly as 'The Lion King' from being too faithful and not having enough of its own identity, but what comes over faithfully does not have the same impact or feel anywhere near as fresh. The additional content mostly doesn't add as much as ought and bloats the film, which could have been 15 minutes shorter (which was a fairly similar problem too with 'Beauty and the Beast'). Marwan Kenzari is a complete non-entity as a pretty one-note Jafar, whose back-story was laudable on paper but wasn't particularly compelling somehow. Abu, Iago and Rajah don't make anywhere near the same impression either, though Abu has his moments (helps too that Frank Welker is back, Iago however sounded odd without Gilbert Gottfried who voiced the character for the original and its two sequels and the television show).\n\nOn the whole, lacklustre but has its moments. 4/10",

It's not the best movie out there, but it is really fun to watch, especially with your family.

Here is what I think Disney should have done way better: script, dialogues, characterization, giving the right space on the screen to the protagonist (Aladdin). At a certain point, I was wondering if the main character was Aladdin or Jasmine... meh. By the way, it is a good movie and I think it can remind you of some nostalgic items.

They picked a good Aladdin and making the tiger more realistic was a much better addition than making the lions more realistic in the Lion King remake had been. That movie had prepared me to expect a pervasive feeling of unnecessary futility in this one, but I didn't end up feeling that at all and so this far exceeded my expectations. Kudos!",

People can't help but compare his version to that of Robin Williams', and I don't blame them; Robin Williams was so outrageously funny as Genie in the original animated movie that it would be hard to top that. Costumes and production sets were very colorful -- equally spectacular as the original. Special effects were  good. Problem is: there's almost nothing new to offer. I dare say that it's a lesser version of the animated classic because it lacks the original's magical quality and splendor. The romance and humor didn't really help much either. For me, this is just a more colorful, vibrant remake of the first movie. But it was still interesting to see these characters come to life.",

The choreography and acting are the only strings holding this film up, with the writing and pace being boulders trying to sink it.

Naomi Scott does a good job as Jasmine and her singing voice is amazing, often giving me chills. Will Smith is enjoyable as the Genie, but the part needed a rewrite, as did \"Friend Like Me\" and \"Prince Ali\", to accommodate Will Smith style of comedy instead of the late Robin Williams (who the animated version was specifically written for). Marwan Kenzari was miscast as Jafar. He did not feel as menacing or unhinged as the original character.

All of the musical numbers were done to perfection, as well as the new songs included in the film. The animation looked great, even making a big blue Genie look like he belongs in our world. The only major gripe I have with this movie is the actor who played Jafar was nowhere near as harsh and menacing as the character was in the original. All in all, even if you do not like live action remakes and are worried they will ruin your favorite film, you do not need to worry with this version of the film.

Third is about the music, I fell in love with this movie mostly because of the music, some people may not like it but for my own personal taste, I love it. But, every movie always has its downsides, at least one, here are two things I find a bit distracting, one is about the editing, the graphics and SFX are good, but I saw a mini clip that caught my eye, for about 2 whole seconds I saw the color green, exactly like the green screen I do not know if it's on purpose but it's there, secondly, when I rewatched it, it was just plain old boring, since I knew what was gonna happen, this movie is not the type of movie that you would be able to watch over and over again without getting bored in a short amount of time.",

Will Smith was given the role and he honesty knocked it out of the park. He did the best he could and that to me was good enough. Nothing could ever replace Robin Williams but Will Smith did a great job with his own spin on the character. Both Mena and Naomi who played Aladdin and Jasmine also did respect to their roles. The movie was designed beautifully but sort of felt restricted and felt like sets instead of a natural environment. The music was classic as always with decent covers done by the actors and Jasmines new song was a nice addition. By the end, your happy the movie was a great reimagining of the beloved cartoon you grew up with. ",

I legit was debating whether to see this movie in theaters or wait till dvd or I should say now a days on the Disney plus streaming service and I'm glad that I picked theaters because I surprisingly had a blast with this movie. I really thought that it would suck because those trailers looked really bad and super edgy. And Aladdin is supposed to be super I don't want to say kid friendly but a role model kind of and those trailers felt like something else. Now back to the movie itself. Let's talk about the actors.",

            "content": "I grew up in a glorious time in respect to Disney, during the time of the classics like 'The Lion King', 'The Little Mermaid', and 'Beauty & The Beast'. I still remember taping over VHS tapes anytime one of the Disney classics came on, and none was more of my 'jam' (pun intended) than 'Aladdin'.  From the beautiful animation, the story, and of course the great Robin Williams as Genie, It was a huge influence in my childhood.\n\nDisney has been working to recapture the magic from these properties again and modernize them for a new generation of kids, some or their attempts being major hits and some just not hitting the mark (you need only look back a couple months to the Tim Burton Remake of 'Dumbo' for the latter). 'Aladdin' for me felt very much to be going in the direction of being a mess, mainly from the marketing and the jarring Blue Will Smith, that while I get them wanting to show him in the trailers, really did him no favors in the long run, because not only is 'Aladdin' on of Disney's best attempts at a live-action remake, but Will Smith brings his Genie into his own and sets himself apart from Robin Williams in smart and creative ways.\n\nWhat I loved right off the bat with this film is the world it's set in and how immersive it is. The trailers kind of made the set designs and locations out to appear somewhat \"Cheap\" but I would suggest that it's due to director Guy Ritchies choice to play the first two acts almost like a live Broadway show. The music, the acting, the atmosphere is all very vibrant and infectious and I loved being immersed in the film.\n\nAladdin and Jasmine, played by Mena Massoud & Naomi Scott had great chemistry. I loved both of their performances and they both were able to sell the singing, dancing, all of it very well. Jasmines maid, played by SNL's Nasim Pedrad was terrific comedic releif, as well as a very brief but hilarious scene with 'Game Nights' Billy Magnussen. They decided on the animal characters like Abu and Raja to be completely CGI, which in the case of using a live tiger compares to CGI... I would have done the same however, with Abu sometimes it was really clear that Mena Massoud wasn't interacting with anything, when they could have maybe have had a mix of practical and CGI to give Aladdin and Abu a more tangible relationship.\n\nWill Smith as the Genie was the absolute star of the show. Much like the Late Robin Williams, Will Smith made the perfect choice to play this character as Will Smith, and not an interpretation of Robin Williams performance. You would think from the trailers that Smiths Genie wouldn't work but with how much charisma and fun Smith puts into this role he really makes it his own. Of course, nobody can replace Williams and for me he will always be my Genie, but if anyone leaves the theater with an issue, it won't be with Will Smith.\n\nTo me the story wavered a bit when they added or deviated from the original sourcematerial. Particularly, hot Jafar, played by Marwan Kenzari. Why they decided to take away some of the more sinister and creepy parts of this character I don't really understand. They chose to take Jafar away from the more magical parts of his character and focus on him being more a behind the curtains political figure. Only until the 3rd act does the movie remember that Jafar needs to be a powerful sorcerer but to me, the 3rd act ended up being a little underwhelming because I never really felt like Aladdin or Jasmine were in danger with him.\n\nAlso the film adds a new song for Jasmines character that to me really felt out of place. Maybe it was where the reprise was placed but the lyrics to me were just not in tone with any of the other Aladdin songs, and ripped me out of the movie.\n\nOverall though, 'Aladdin' is a genuine delightful surprise. I had a blast with the musical numbers, the dancing, it all worked so well, definitely go and check this one out in theaters!",

The genie was a big spot to fill and Will Smith was possibly the worst choice.

            "content": "Summary: improves on several aspects of the original film and stands in its own right.\n\nSo I finally got around to seeing 2019's Aladdin on Disney+. I'd heard not-bad things about it, but I was still pleasantly surprised. In my opinion, this remake improves upon the original animated film in several key ways.\n\nThe Good:\n- Jasmine: This is the largest and best change and, in my opinion, the most necessary change as well. The original film's character of Jasmine has aged poorly - she suffers from a severe lack of agency and is one of the foremost offenders in Disney's history of sexualizing and objectifying women of color. Thankfully, these issues are gone in the 2019 film. This version of Jasmine makes important decisions that impact the plot and stands for herself. The horny side of the internet might cry in frustration that Jasmine no longer wears a bra and harem pants for most of the movie; everyone else will breath a sigh of relief that her most plot-important action no longer involved seducing a man twice her age.\n\n- Story additions: Unlike 2019's The Lion King, which seemingly changes nothing about the story yet somehow manages to waste an additional 30 minutes of our time, the additions to Aladdin's story are easy to spot if you've seen both films. These additions, like an extended meet-cute for Aladdin and Jasmine, help flesh out the story and the relationships. The addition of the handmaid adds another female character and expands the genie's motivation and personality. And speaking of the genie, while no one can replace Robin Williams, Will Smith is an incredibly talented and charismatic performer in his own right and brings a fresh take on a beloved character.\n\n- The visuals: while there is certainly much to lose in the transition from animation to live action, this movie demonstrates what can be gained. The city of Agrabah in particular is brimming with color, detail and life that is simply not possible in traditional animation. You can see different architectural styles blended together in different parts of the city, giving a sense of the city's long history. As someone who spent several years living in the Middle East, this detail felt authentic and was appreciated. Many aspects of the film, including casting actors of Middle Eastern descent, feel more authentic in this version.\n\n\nThat's not to say it's a perfect film, nor that it's better than the original in every way. While I enjoyed the way this movie gives a little more character and backstory to Jafar, the performance is less delightfully evil than the original's and, as a result, less memorable. Additionally, there were (thankfully few) moments where Smith's genie tried to imitate aspects of William's genie with less-than-perfect results. The \"Prince Ali\" number is the most notable instance of this.\n\nOverall, though, the 2019 remake improves in many key ways upon the original classic, to the point that this is the version I'll be showing my kids once they're old enough to watch movies.",

They even added a handmaiden to her which actually was an improvement to the movie. Though the result was a horny genie, so I guess it cancelled itself out.\n\nIts not that Will Smith was a bad genie, but he knew he couldn't be Robin Williams. When he took it over for the Genie to be his own he went too relaxed, and not only did the songs suffer for it, but the music wasn't adapted so it looks like Will Smith just isn't performing (and I believe he still can).\n\nThe entire movie suffers from this \"step-dad syndrome\", it's not that movie and characters aren't what we're used to: its that Disney used the original as a template, changed half of the movie then stopped.

Instead of either making a complete remake, or a twist on the original, they merged both, and it just didn't work right, feeling like a play. Guy Ritchie & John August didn't grasp a sense of style, or personality; nothing was improved from the first, they cut notable scenes short, while also not doing the iconic scenes justice. They did nothing but move around a few scenes, throwing off the pace, and calling it their own. The first act was probably the most enjoyable act, but the pacing was SOO fast! It feels like you watched half of the original, in 20 minutes. Come the second act is where it takes it drastic dip, and doesn't turn back.\n\nLucinda Syson did a pretty good job casting this talented cast, but some characters didn't live up to the expectations, due to the iffy writing by Guy Ritchie & John August. Their jokes were hit or miss, with some cringey writing at times, that didn't have that charming appeal the original had. I appreciated what they did by trying to give everyone a little bit more focus, but with most of the dialogue scenes, they got dry really fast. I don't really care for Jafar and his motive as it is, so I just wasn't a fan of him or Marwan Kenzari here either. As for Iago, I hated him so much! I understand it's live action, but Gilbert Gottfried was a favorable character in the original, and they didn't do his character with respect at all ! The Sultan was a little more aware of what was going on, but he wasn't nearly as funny as the last time, and was still essentially pointless. Will Smith had some big shoes to fill playing the role as the Genie, trademarked by Robin Williams. Smith was one of the main reasons this movie didn't completely plummet. He put on a charming performance, that lived up to the genie name, for the most part. As for Mena Massoud, I feel like he didn't get enough credit. I thought he put on a great performance, for a far fetched character to capture in live action. All of these characters did a great job singing, and had some great choreography. \n\nAlan Meken returned to do the music for the remake. The songs were subpar at best, butchering most of the iconic songs. Some of the song drops were a little strange at times, and seemed like it was a little cluttered.\n\nThe cinematography by Alan Stewart was captured nicely. It was very vibrant, but had a few really dark scenes. The visual effects by Chas Jarrett & Chris Upson was below par, with a lot of room for improvement.\n\nOverall, it's whatever. Wouldn't go out of my way to watch it again, but I was expecting worse.",

While we can the wonder about the wisdom of such an end of year there is no denying the lucre that's results for such enterprises. So we can expect this kind of thing to keep happening for quite a while. Sometimes the results can be inspired such as was the case with DUMBO or MALEFICIENT which expanded on the universe's created in the original cartoons. in other cases like here with ALADDIN or with THE LION KING, it can be so slavishly close to the original animated feature that one wonders why they bothered to remake them in the first place.\n\nEspecially in this case where one of the main draws of 1992's Aladdin was Robin Williams' bravura Performance as the genie. To try to replace him was destined to create dissension and dissatisfaction. Will Smith's casting and first images portraying him wearing the blue skin created a huge shit storm on the internet, although he does is best to set apart is performance from Williams' and make it his own.\n\nGuy Ritchie's film, while forgettable, is still colorfully entertaining and sports a terrific new song which is a perfect anthem for the #metoo movement, and its inclusion in a film that will no doubt be seen by scores of young people is almost reason enough for its existence. And key scenes like the Magic Carpet Ride are simply gorgeous.\n\nin the end it is a rough throwback to the Harryhausen and Sinbad movies of the 60s, something that has been sorely missing from our screens.",

The only shred of evil and maniacal behavior was shown when he kicked the person down the hole in the beginning of the movie. The rest of the movie he just goes on being a boring vanilla bad guy obsessed with destroying a neighboring city that gets little to no reason why he wants to destroy it so badly.\n\nThe cave of wonders scene was terrible. The animation made it look fancy but did nothing to help the movie.\n\nThe whole romance between Jasmin and Aladdin was chemically not there at all.\n\nThe music was noticeably auto-toned and the iconic music was poorly sung and put together. What happened to the \"Whole New World\" song where they go around the world on A MAGIC CARPET to Greece, China and the Egypt? We got grubby dark scenes instead and poor singing.\n\nThe acting felt forced throughout the entire movie. I.E. The Yam Jam scene.\n\nThere was no back story behind the whole \"both of our moms sang us the same song before bed\". There was so many plot holes added to this movie that there didn't need to be. I'm all for women's rights and making sure women get their fair share, but what was with the Sultan being like, \"My daughter can be the Sultan because shes strong.\" felt more like a cop-out and pandering for the female audience to show a strong female role in a Disney movie rather than staying true to the original animation.\n\nThis movie is out of sync with the animated movie that it leaves you feeling disappointed after finishing the movie. It leaves you that feeling of not ever wanting to watch it on your own free will. But you would only watch it on television while you are bored and would just watch it because it might be the only thing on television at that moment.\n\nThis had all the terrible directive skill of M. Night Shyamalan when he made \"The Last Airbender\".",

It's just a fun time. Jafar is really boring however and is so wooden, the songs have a bit too much autotune (especially A Whole New World), Aladdin gets a bit sidelined at times and the movie relies a bit too much on CGI and bright colors everywhere that it starts becoming disturbing to the eye. It can also feel rushed and slow at times but it's definitely one of the better remakes.",

It isn't as great as the original from twenty-seven years prior, though it does a fine job nevertheless.\n\nWill Smith is no Robin Williams obviously, but no-one would ever have met the extremely high standards that Mr. Williams set as Genie. Smith does well, I enjoy his humour and overall performance in this.\n\nMena Massoud is very likeable as the titular character, I think he brings more life to Aladdin than Scott Weinger does from 1992. Naomi Scott is excellent as Jasmine, who is miles more developed in this production.\n\nNow for the elephant in the room: Jafar.\n\nMarwan Kenzari, if I only judge his performance, is more than satisfactory. However, he simply has to be judged based on Jonathan Freeman's version of the antagonist. Kenzari's Jafar is nowhere near as fearsome and devilish as he should be, I'm never uneasy when he appears here.\n\nAway from the wannabe Sultan, I would've liked to have seen more of Abu and, especially, Iago - who should've been voiced by Gilbert Gottfried by the way. On the other hand, Navid Negahban is decent as Jasmine's father.\n\nOverall, despite some iffy CGI and editing, it makes for entertaining viewing. The music, although changed, is as fun as before (I also liked Jasmine's new song, 'Speechless'). I've seen lesser remakes, that's for sure.",

It's still an interesting experiment in itself.  It's not bad, it's enjoyable for what it is, but at the end of the day if I want Aladdin I'll probably just go back to the original.  They make some weird changes for the worse here (especially in the climax) that just don't help the story, and despite being longer it weirdly rushes through some classic moments in a Cliff Notes fashion.  And then there's Jafar.  A lot's been said about him, so I won't pile on, but holy god talk about miscasting, he was awful.  Still, there were some things I liked, even some changes I liked.  I like that Jasmine is a little more fleshed out, and Naomi Scott is absolutely bringing everything she can to this role.  I also like the look and set design of Agrabah.  I don't know how much of this was a real set and how much was CGI, but it really feels like a living breathing world that you could walk around in.  As for Will Smith's genie, honestly he surprised the hell out of me.  The movie really comes alive when he shows up.  It's different than Robin Williams, but it has to be.  I was ready to hate him, but he was charming and funny.  Did every beat hit for him?  Will he ever replace Williams?  No to both, but he was good enough for what the movie needed.  Then there's the things the movie tried that just didn't quite work, namely its music.  It's sort of doing a Bollywood thing, and while it's got all the flair it just lacks the energy and passion.  In the \"One Jump\" sequence, a lot of stuff is happening, but it sort of feels like they're all going through the motions.  It's not as fun/funny as the animated film, and it doesn't have the flair or energy of a Bollywood film.  The Prince Ali segment desperately wants to be a big Bollywood number, but just looks like someone filmed a pretty good parade.  There are exceptions, like \"Friend Like Me\", but for the most part this is the standard.  I'd say either go all in, or cut the songs entirely, but instead they try to meet in the middle.  And that feels like a lot of the movie, they try to meet in the middle.  The result is a movie that's not bad, but never truly great either.  It's just okay.

In this case, I found myself wishing it had stayed truer to the original because the added scenes or changes in dialogue weren't working. The casting of Jafar seemed off. I liked where Disney was going with Jasmine's character in making her the sultan and just giving it a slightly more modern female role, but it didn't go far enough. And Aladdin just seemed like a twerp to me, not likable...probably a combination of the acting and script. The bright spot for me was Will Smith as genie and the additional backstory he and his family had...that was cool...but again, Disney didn't go far enough in making him distinct / different enough from the legendary Robin Williams genie which is one of the best Disney characters of all time. Drawing from the superior Lion King remake, the lesson is clear: either don't mess with the magic of the original and largely stay true to it (as Lion King did), or truly make your mark by redefining/reinventing it....but pick a direction and don't go half ass either way as this one did.",

He's more good at doing crime and fun new original characters. But with this film it felt exactly the same, if anything worse. Following the same narrative beats as the original and anything Guy tried to do to be original didn't work. The new song they added where everyone did a snap didn't was cringe and the dance scene n the palace was entertaining but was just pointless. But, the worst thing of all was Jaffar. He was the most weak and unintimidating villain of all time which just disrespects the original. Even in the final battle, which for one was bland and boring, he just seemed crap overall. Going back to the final battle it was a giant cgi mess that was just horrible to look at. But the only saving grace of this movie was Will Smith genie who was almost on par with Robin Williams but also bought his own acting flair which was just an excellent site to see.",

Good job on the casting they really physically look like the characters (except jafar). But there is no chemistry beetween Jasmine and Aladdin, the acting is really poor, all the jokes fell flat. The only good point is for Will Smith who kinda save the movie as the genie. \n4) Why change a perfectly good and working story ? Adding the plot of an upcoming war bring absolutely nothing to the movie. Every other scene is useless. We don't care that Jafar use to be a thief. If you want to change the scenario change it completely and go back to the original story (the book). \n5) I still don't understand what was the point of Jasmine's song.\n6) Why is this so slow and boring !\nIn conclusion, well done Disney you ruined Aladdin for me.\n\nPS Good point for not showing a huge disgusting snake.",

The colour is really vibrant combine it with the good craft of middle east aesthetic and customs. for a (kind of) musical movie the songs are great, mostly just a remake song from its animation flick which is a classic, there's some scene where the song felt really out of place and really break it's pacing to develop the character.

The story is of course the same, but there are some changes that were made some minor, and some a bit more confusing and unnecessary like a few lyric changes in songs like Arabian Nights, and Prince Ali. Yet despite the films imperfections it manages to be one of the better Disney remakes and still left me satisfied overall and I can recommend this film easily to the average moviegoer or even the biggest of Disney fans who may be curious on whether or not to take a chance on another Disney remake. I give Aladdin 2019 a 7/10",

The one redeeming cast member, Naomi Scott (Jasmine), is overshadowed by the atrocities of Mena Massoud (Aladdin) and Marwan Kenzari (Jafar). Both Massoud and Kenzari portray their best renditions of animated comic book characters, standing out like a fly on a wedding cake. Will Smith's performance as the Genie is surprisingly acceptable, but the script does him no justice. I feel as if the film's screenwriters have no understanding for the fundamental importance of genuine characters and natural storytelling. Yet somehow, the screenwriters find themselves more appealing than the editing team, as the film is edited like an early-2000s low budget action film. Children who just want to see quippy and fast paced dialogue will find entertainment in \"Aladdin\", but no, this is not a film of quality. In my opinion, \"Aladdin\" was the worst film of 2019.",

Also, if the movie was just a clip of Will Smith singing \"Friend Like Me\", I absolutely would've been okay with that too. Granted, some of the characters and subplots are either there for really no reason (looking at you, Prince Anders), or don't really need to be there at all for the story to move forward (ANDERS), but still a pretty faithful retelling with a Genie that can be loved as much as Robin William's.",

The film is too cartoony to be a more grounded reboot and is too realistic in places to have the charm of the animated version. I mean why is the monkey real except people still bounce and flip around in cartoon fashion? Why change The Sultan and take out all of his lightness, and why change Jafar to take away all of his menace? (although I sort of like his sort of sad beta male energy and street-rat backstory) It's a totally toothless film, no passion in the musical numbers, no reinvention, just a bunch of decisions made in the wrong direction. It's missing all of the magic and wit of the original in the same terrible street set over and over again and dull harsh sunlight; remember the beautiful wistful moonlight scene over Agrabah in Disney's Aladdin where Aladdin and Jasmine see the same landmark in two different ways? Both prisoners of their birth? His home more of a palace than hers? That's replaced in almost every way by a scene that looks like a Nickelodeon TV show.\n\nI was nowhere nearly convinced by Naomi Scott before I saw the film and then almost immediately I was convinced at her ability to be a live action Disney Princess, her facial features, purity of look, and voice she puts on are pitch perfect Disney and reassuring. Mena Massoud as Aladdin was horrific at first, he looks like a waifish and oafish nerd and incapable of standing up for himself, the animated Aladdin was coy, sheepish but loveable and aspirational. However Massoud blossoms when he's Prince Ali, he's hilarious, it works, and his banter is on point.\n\nNow, on to Will Smith's Genie. At first look, every decision to digitally animate his face is all kinds of uncanny valley and it looks like 1/3 of the performance that Will Smith usually gives and makes the Genie an unapproachable frightening alien figure. But every time he looks like Smith, despite being a cop out, you can see he's acting up a storm; a warm and human figure, I would happily see more of him free in a solo movie. He's funny and full of wisdom, it's a different approach to Robin Williams, but that's what we need in 2019. But I don't remotely believe his relationship with Aladdin due to some reshuffling of scenes and no real actual moments of warmth between them.\n\nMenken's music is the real star here, just fun and modern enough and just reverential and nostalgic enough. It totally rides the line better than any other element of the film. It serves to make me ache even more for the spirit of the original.\n\nThis film reminds me of Snyder's Watchmen, a copy of a copy, it looks the same, but nothing of what I liked about the source material has been translated well. The film has none of the danger, magic or fourth-wall antics or lyricism of the original. It's got dodgy autotune and worse CGI. Everything is cringey about how off-brand it is. Like the Panda Cola version of Disney's Aladdin.",

Honestly, I know everyone loves the songs in the original, but I think it would have gone much better to have made this more like Maleficent, not a musical, just flesh out the characters more, add some more backstory, maybe lean on a telling from Genie's perspective...etc.   I think it's better to tell a new story rather than give us a subpar Cash grab remake.",

The humor was actually pretty funny and I found myself laughing out loud during a scene featuring an excruciatingly awkward meeting and an over-mentioning of jams. Will Smith actually does make the genie character his own by playing him in a more haughty-fashion-designer-meets-Hitch kind of way, rather than try to emulate Robin William's brilliantly frenetic man-of-a-thousand-voices persona. Aladdin and Jasmine are likable and have decent chemistry, and Jasmine in particular kind of steals the show with her more passionately politically-ambitious take on the character, combined with some powerful new musical numbers. My wife and I in particular enjoyed \"Speechless.\" There are also some very visually creative sequences, such as a singing chase through the streets that keeps switching film speeds while maintaining mouth sync to create a fun and artfully cartoonish sequence. I felt like the humor generally felt pretty organic and not forced or awkwardly shoe-horned in, unlike some other live-action Disney films of late I could mention. It also doesn't have fake-woke messaging awkwardly inserted in embarrassing ways. It has good positive progressive messages for both boys and girls without being preachy or virtue-signaling, and I appreciate that. No, this film is not a visually stunning work of artistic perfection like the original cell-animated version, but it's a genuinely fun watch. I was happily surprised and delighted.

I was so dang excited to hear what Smith was going to bust out with, and it just wasn't ever there.  Such a missed golden opportunity.\n\nAnd that kind of goes for all of the songs.  They all just kind of sounded very flat.  Which is a real shame because Disney songs are so much of why we go see the movies.\n\nThe acting never really felt real. Much like the music it was just very flat.  I don't think I can really blame the actors, a lot of the changes made were an attempt to update the story.  The original story was one of \"you are just fine the way you are, don't change\".  That's a great story hook.  But adding the story line around Jasmine trying to be sultan, and it's almost too much.  The two story lines get cluttered together and both messages get kinda lost.\n\nOn a bright note I particularly enjoyed the new spin on Genie having a love interest.  It was beyond a doubt one of the highlights of the film and both characters give off a genuine and adorable chemistry that any couple will recognize.\n\nAll in all I didn't hate it, I didn't dislike it, I just didn't particularly like it either.  It was just.......ok",

            "content": "TL;DR: This movie has the same amount of heart as the stars on my review. The music sounds like it was done by a high schooler. Where is the emotion? I wanted to be pulled from my seat and turned into someone who loved ANY of the human characters; Raja the tiger was my favorite btw. No heart, no emotion, terrible remake of the music, horrible cgi, but I will give the props guy some love. The props and animals were the best thing about this movie. \n\n\nNo emotion or heart in it AT ALL. During \"One Jump Ahead (Reprise)\" Aladdin is supposed to be sad, disheartened, and angry. Everyone is calling him a \"street rat\" and thinks he's nothing and will become nothing; he should be WAY more upset about this than he is. When the sultan is on the brink of death, Jasmine should be in near tears and fury as her father grips death. Jafar wasn't creepy, angry, or menacing; he was just rude and unhappy at everything. He's like Squidward when Squidward isn't mad just put-off. During the part where the genie tries to storm off mad, it just sounds like he was inconvenienced and set back a few minutes rather than crapped on for who knows how long. Aladdin said he would wish for Genie's freedom, which is HUGE if you don't know the story, and now Aladdin's said he might have to wish for something else. Who knows what that will be or when. And if the wish isn't for Genie's freedom, then who will set him free if the one guy who said he would do it won't? No heart, no emotion. 0/10\n\nThe music was very autotuned. If you don't believe me go back and listen to \"Prince Ali\" but only listen to Will Smith, forget the instruments. You have the musical genius of Tim Rice, Alan Menken, AND Will Smith yet the music was trash and sounded like a high schooler put it together. Everything was screwed up musically. Jasmine didn't need or deserve a song nor did she deserve to be Sultan; she deserves a whole movie where she can express herself and her backstory. Where is Jafar's song to help us showcase his new powers? Everyone minus Hakim, Jafar, Raja, and the Sultan get a song. Also, I thought Hakim sold discount fertilizer... 1/10 for the nice reference. \n\nThe cave of wonders was poorly done and didn't live up to the \"wonder\" part. Jafar's wishes weren't done spectacularly. The Prince Ali scene wasn't as grand as I'd hoped. \"Friend Like Me\" was also VERY toned down; they did poor on something that had a lot of potential making good.. Also, was the whole budget spent on the team that made Will Smith blue and all genie looking? Abu looked nice. 1/10 just for Abu.\n\nThe jewelry and props were all spectacular. The lamps were nicely made, the staves had amazing design, and all the clothes were fun to look at. Loved the bright colors and the toned down portions of commoners. Made it lovely to look at. 10/10 only for props, colors, and clothing.\n\nSure you can't compare Will to Robin but even then the genie sucked; no heart. Aladdin being crafty and witty was never explained and felt forced. Why is he saying all this about the genie being more powerful? He hasn't been cunning with his words at any point in the movie; so why is he now? Jafar getting thrown in prison makes no sense; he's cunning and manipulative. You'd think he'd have some sort of escape route or other way of getting out of the room. He even said he was once just like Aladdin, only better. Aladdin can outrun guards, do flips, and make huge jumps. Assuming Jafar hasn't done it in a while but remembers most of the technique, I think he could've done better. Plus, it makes no sense how he escaped unless you've seen the first film. Also, how did he make it out without being noticed? A lot more questions than answers. The feminist angle wasn't done correctly and took over the movie. Made it a lot less magical. 0/10.\n\nWhat did they spend the budget on? Was it spent on turning Will Smith blue and getting him to and from the lamp, the wishes, Jafar's powers, the tiger, the tons of jewelry, the fake gold, props, \"fat Aladdin\", the credits, the dance number at the end, the cg monkey, or the over done lighting? I'm confused and certain I could remake the movie with the exact same budget or less and it would be better than the stain this has left. The movie should have gone direct to DVD. -1/10, who knows I'm still confused.",

The main narrative in the cartoon movie was Aladdin trying to get Princess Jasmine to fall in love with him, lying to her about who he was and how his relationship with the genie evolved over the movie into a deep seated friendship. While some of this was kept intact, I couldn't help but feel like the main narrative of this movie was Princess Jasmine trying to break away from old traditions, causing her relationship with Aladdin being a side plot. As far as Aladdin and the Genie go, I never bought the friendship between the two. Mena Massoud and Will Smith were perfect choices to play Aladdin and the Genie. For the most part they carry the movie as individuals but in the scenes together, really seemed to lack chemistry. My last gripe about the movie involved the new music, it was terrible.",

That being said, and analyzing this without comparing the quality of the two, the story that they have presented us with unconvincing characters that are difficult to connect with and therefor difficult to empathize with. For example: Jasmine, in an attempt at making her independent (a very golden age thing to do), was extremely one dimensional. There wasn't much depth to her character. The other characters had similar pitfalls. Not to mention the problematic nature of the scene where Aladdin enters jasmine's room both without permission or her knowledge. The flashy colors and dance numbers were reminiscent of a Bollywood movie which I appreciated but didn't feel like was brought to it's full potential. They created an awkward and unpleasing middle ground between genres where there could have been a spectacularly exciting new type of film. Very uninspired. Disappointing.",

There were lots of moments where Will made me laugh and his comedic timing was on point. Marwan Kenzari who played the role of Jafar for me was too pretty for a villain and unfortunately his voice was annoying and off putting. Normally when you see a villain, the pitch of their voices is low and dark. I was left cringing and gritting my teeth. Mena Massoud Who played Aladdin played the part well although I didn't believe he had been living on the street all his life. He was too pretty for the role and needed to look rougher.

The king, monkey, parrot or carpet are also not very interesting. Away from that, the main actors are not badly chosen, but none them, not everything else, bright in comparison with the animated characters. When the genius arrives, movie has certain resurrection (Will Smith is not \"the\" genius but, for sure, is very good being himself), though far away from the original film, and the very little additions do not help enough.",

New songs and tunes were added to the film to make it more appealing but the original classic hit A Whole New World is still its famed and main soundtrack song that will never be separated from Aladdin.

He doesn't succeed and in years to come it will still be Robin Williams that people think of when they remember this character but he got as close to a decent performance as you might hope for considering what he was up against. \nThe rest of the cast held their own, giving entertaining performances and singing all songs with gusto but Jafar was somewhat of a disappointment.  He just didn't come across as creepy or sinister enough compared to the original character so he was very forgettable. \nSo, it wasn't the complete car crash I was expecting, it was entertaining but not one I would go back to.",

Will smith is a good genie and was a pleasant to watch. Naomi was decent, I've never really cared for Jasmine even in the original so I'd say Naomi did good. Marwan is not a good Jafar, he's just so boring in this film and lacks the evil characterization from the original. Music wise it was hit or miss, auto tune was extremely present. Songs like \"one jump ahead\" we're dragged down with auto tune and bad cinematography (like wtf were those angles and weird pacing). But songs like \"Friend Like Me\" were actually good and worked, besides the iffy beatboxing. \"Speechless\" wasn't a very good addiction, it was kinda bland and I don't know it just didn't mesh well with the film, I don't even really like it outside the context of the film.

A street urchin (Mena Massoud) falls in love with a princess (Naomi Scott) and then uses the magic of a genie (Will Smith) to pose as a prince so as to try and win her hand in marriage.  But when a power-hungry Grand Vizier (Marwan Kenzari) also wants control of the genie, anything could happen.  I suppose this is just going to be something that we are getting every quarter now, and I've made the conscientious decision not to support these live-action remakes in theaters.  I will still watch them at home because I watch and review everything I can get my hands on, but I'm sure studios look at box office numbers when deciding what films to make next.  While Aladdin is one of the better live-action Disney remakes, I'm going to say the same thing when I just reviewed Lady and the Tramp: there's just no reason to watch it.  Now it really did look like the stage was set for a train wreck.  This is helmed by Guy Ritchie, and to say that I haven't been a fan of his last decade of work would be putting it kindly.  The trailers looked mediocre, and the clip that they released early for the Prince Ali musical number only highlighted the fact that Will Smith can't sing.  Perhaps Disney did that to lower everybody's expectations, but I did end up feeling that this was more watchable than not.  You can't deny that Will Smith is unable to hit the notes that the songs call for, but I did appreciate the fact that he's not just mimicking Robin Williams's performance because that would have left a bad taste in everybody's mouth.  Because of the highs and lows, he ended up being mostly a wash for me, but I did really like Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott together as Aladdin and Jasmine, especially when they were onscreen together.  They have good chemistry together, and this movie really called for the commitment that they were prepared to give.  Not all is great with the cast, however, because the weakest link by far in this is Marwan Kenzari as Jafar.  The role is one of the best Disney villains of all time, and the way that he chose to play it is just so boring and blas\u00e9; he gives a performance that is completely devoid of personality when the part is anything but that.  I think Ritchie did a better job with this than I expected, and the action choreography does fit together pretty fluently.  It is consistent in tone and quality throughout, but it still can never shake that made-for-TV vibe that it has about it.  I still feel the same way that I feel about all of these movies in that this adds nothing new, so even through there are plenty of moments where it is not failing, there is still no reason to watch this over the original.",

For example, \"Arabian Nights\" that is shown in the begining of the move really help the audience to understand the origin of geenie withoud getting bored. Personally, i really enjoyed that part. The main offiial soundtrack \"A whole New World\" is realy iconic, thissong really set up te whole movie's vibe. Other remarkable song in this movie is \"Prince Ali\". Ths song is being shown when Prince Ali or Aaddin came to propose Princess Jasmine. It as an amazing scene ,but withouth the song, this scene would've been \"bland\". But i felt that there are too many songs in this movie that just seems unecessary. Also, i also felt that there are some songs tha doesn't have the wow factor due to the lack of the singer quality.Sorry to say,but i think that Will Smith that play as the Geenie is not the best singer, i think that the song that are being sang by him seems to have too much autotune in it. In conclusion, the songs in Aladdin are really great and have significnt role to the story line, but there are song that would be better if it's not included in the movie and there are songs that could've been better",

            "content": "Guy Ritchie's Aladdin is another in the line of Live Action remakes that the Disney Machine is churning out. This year alone they had Dumbo, Lion King in July, and Maleficent 2 in October.\n\nAladdin is of course extremely similar to the original 1992 animated film but, however we get Ritchie's spin and Will Smith as the Genie! Everyone knows the story, smart but poor boy Aladdin finds a magic lamp, befriends the genie, and through some hijinx wins Princess Jasmine, and defeats Jafar. What makes this fun though is there are new characters, new songs, and outstanding choreography for all the musical numbers. Growing up I always enjoyed the music even more than the story so I was glad to see Ritchie seemed to really focus on that. He also brought in Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (Dear Evan Hansen and the Greatest Showman) to write the new Disney Anthem \"Speechless\" for Naomi Scott to sing as Jasmine.\n\nI will say it is a slow start and it is tough to see this movie is over two hours when the original is like 94 minutes. The actions scenes did look great though, and everything with magic carpet was cool filmmaking. They really try to put more of an emphasis on Jasmine it seems, because she did not get a ton to do in the first, and was considered one of the lamer Disney Princesses. Naomi Scott's Portrayal will be one that should be talked about coming out of this movie.\n\nStock Watch\n\nStock Up \u2013 Will Smith is fully back with his dynamite performance here. Replacing the iconic Robin Williams Genie was the biggest question everyone had going into this. Smith absolutely paid tribute to Williams, while also putting his own spin on the legendary character. This could set up a nice back half of his career if he plays it right.\n\nStock Up \u2013 Mena Massoud was a very charming and enjoyable Aladdin that I believe kids will love. He had an incredible voice and was able to dance and do all the stunts necessary it seemed to create the character. I had never seen him before this but I believe he has a bright future ahead of him.\n\nStock Down \u2013 Marwan Kenzari really was not good as Jafar. It came down to the fact for me that he just was not scary and did not really bring an overpowering presence that you need for that role. I again had not seen him as well before this, and in my opinion this performance did him no favors for his future.\n\nStock Up \u2013 Naomi Scott was probably the second best part of this movie after Will Smith's genie. She crushed the new song Speechless and brought a tenacity to the role that was nowhere to be found in the animated version. She is a princess young women can look up to and be proud of and I think that is really important. Loved her in Power Rangers, loved her in this, cant wait to see what is next.\n\n*A couple other tidbits\n\n- The movie definitely took too long to get to the cave of wonders.\n\n- I laughed every time Billy Magnussen opened his mouth, just as I did when he was in Game Night.\n\n-The Genie and Nasim Pedrad story line was weird but it did not take me too far out of the movie.\n\nOverall this seems about par for the course in this reimagining of all the Disney properties. Guy Ritchie brought some flair and made this movie much more enjoyable than I thought it was going to be. It does the original justice and that is all you can ask for.\n\nJuice Rating:\n73/100",

I knew that it was not going to top the original, but it still featured some nice performances, and the musical numbers were very well done, and they were some of the most impressive numbers I have seen in any musical.\nThe two weak points of the film were obviously the CGI and portrayal of Jafar, but luckily they did not completely ruin the film for me.\nThe best thing about this film was definitely Will Smith's performance as the Genie.  He was able to create his own version of the character while still paying homage to Robin Williams.  He could possibly find himself receiving an Oscar nomination.\nThe film as a whole is one of the better remakes that I have seen, and I would consider it as one of the biggest surprises of the year.",

And I'm a man. I'm not sure a better actor could have been chosen for Aladdin, and will smith brought a new spin to the beloved genie, and though I love will smith, I was a bit worried about how he would perform in blue, but he pulled it off a created a new era of \"Disney's genie\" without tarnishing the classic character. Iago was a bit, well, useless, and didn't have all the character from the original animation, and abu was also a bit of a nuisance at times, but all in all I think this is a good movie, good for the kids, for the adults, for those Nostalgia seekers and those unfamiliar with Disney films alike. 4.5/5, brilliant, not perfect, but still brilliant.",

The rest of the cast was fine, but again, bland as heck. The only major changes they made to the movie were adding a song sung by Jasmine (which was blatant pandering, and unnecessarily muddled the movie), adding Jasmine's handmaid as a character (who was bland, and only existed to give the genie a love interest for some reason), the opening and closing scenes that show the genie (who is now a human-does he have a name?) and the handmaid living together on their boat with their kids, and the atrocious climax (JUST TURN JAFAR INTO A BIG FRICKING SNAKE, IT'S NOT THAT HARD!) They try to give Jafar a backstory and a motivation, but in the end he's still a one dimensional bad guy who wants to rule just because, and in the process they stripped him of the fun of being a cool, intimidating bad guy.\nIn the end, 2019 Aladdin is a carbon copy of the original Aladdin, where the only things they change strip the movie of any fun that could be had from watching it.",

In the original 1993 film, Jasmine was the delicate damsel in distress who needed saving and Aladdin was the confident brave hero. I know the whole, outspoken feminist thing is relevant today but in traditional Disney films, the women are the damsels and the men are the heroes. Also, some of the songs that Jasmine sung, weren't even in the 1993 film and had no relevance to the situation. The whole film is a typical woke, anti-male facade to let women achieve some sort of revenge or payback for the supposed fictional repression we gave them, many decades ago. Don't punish the current male generation for something we haven't done. It's the equivalent of blaming the current generation of Germans for WWII.",

            "content": "This movie has been on repeat in my house ever since it came out on video. I only wish I had a time machine so I could go back and watch it in theaters. I didn't do that because I have been so disappointed with all of the previous live-action remakes. \nAs far as the previous live-action remakes go, the most enjoyable one had been Maleficient, but still I did not like it because it changed the story of Sleeping Beauty way too much. It completely made a mockery of Prince Philip's character who had been the hero in Sleeping Beauty. Cinderella was too different from the cartoon. Beauty and the Beast was decent but Emma Watson was miscast (she cannot sing) and so that bothered me and took me out of the film. All of that being said I had zero expectations going into Aladdin when I rented it out of boredom.\nIt blew me away. Will Smith does not disappoint, he is hilarious. Hot zaddy Jafar plays Jafar so creepy and insecure that you almost forget how good-looking Marwan Kenzari is. Naomi Scott as Jasmine is a dream. She is picture perfect in every scene, with every turn of her head, she talks like a Disney Princess and her singing voice is superb. Mena Massoud was perfection through and through. He sang like the cartoon, and he was just as charming with his perfect smile and perfect dimple - he truly looks like he was created in a Disney lab and like he was born to play this role. I'm a forever fan of Mena Massoud now.\nThe audience score for this movie is the true score. I don't understand the critics. I have read all of the reviews and a common theme with that bad reviews are that critics seem to be annoyed with Guy Ritchie and the fact that he was probably paid a great deal to make the movie, and the fact that Disney ended up making a ton of money on the movie. I don't understand what money and business have to do with one's ability to enjoy a fun fairytale. I watched the cartoon again straight away after seeing the live action remake. I didn't think it was possible, but I now like the remake anymore. Another common theme in bad reviews was that Will Smith is not Robin Williams. Well, this is not a critique of the film, rather, it is just a plain and simple fact, so I don't count that as an actual criticism. Another things bad reviewers say is that the CGI in the movie was bad.  Well I'm sorry but I disagree. Yes the genie looks better as a cartoon, but the whole thing being make-believe will obviously work better in animation. We cannot have animation alongisde real people a la \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" nowadays because it would look cheap. And so they have to create a CGI genie. and a CGI magic carpet. And the thing is, it's one thing to criticize a CGI explosion because you can compare it to a real-life explosion and say it looks fake. But there is no such thing as a magic carpet and no such thing as a genie in a lamp, so I think that getting hung up on the CGI of it is just the wrong approach. If you are going to watch this movie, then allow yourself to fall for it a little bit. It's magic, so just accept it and enjoy. This is officially my new favorite movie and I hope Disney learns something and makes better remakes (I'm hoping Little Mermaid will be as good as Aladdin). Also hopeful for an Aladdin sequel. ",

It simply lacked good performance and that certain something that pulls the audience in to the movie. It seemed to be watered down from the original story line and geared to be a movie that parents car tolerate while watching it 100 times. Not a movie for all ages or weither or not you have children.

            "content": "I, honestly, did not want to like this movie. I didn't. Disney classic animations are sacred. If you aren't treading like it is hallowed ground, you don't deserve to be there. Aladdin is one of those movies that is so close to perfect, any changes would probably ruin it more than help it. However, it is obvious that there was a lot of care and consideration brought onto this film by not only the cast, but Guy Richie as well. \n\nThere are issues with the movie, though. \nThere are 2 new songs. They aren't awful songs. One had Jasmine destroying people with her mind after freezing time... Yeah, I'm serious. It was weird until after the song was over and honestly I was very confused as to what was going on. Like I said, they aren't bad songs, but they don't fit. Were they needed? I thought the music from the original was perfectly fine and we didn't need new songs, but there they are. The new songs also bring up the issue with script changes in this movie. Within the first 10 minutes of the movie, we are mixing the song One Jump Ahead with Jasmine being out of the palace and charged with theivery in the marketplace. Originally, these 2 seperate scenes happen outside of 30 minutes from each other. Was this mangling of the original script needed to push the 2 Jasmine songs through? If they were, I'd say that maybe they shouldn't have done that. \n\nWill Smith did very well bringing out his version of Genie while paying small homages to the late Robin Williams. The changes were noticable. But they weren't bad enough to make anyone cringe. I will add that they do, however, make you want to shout out the Williams line. \n\nThe main actor was very good. I enjoyed his performance. Unlike Genie, the role of Aladdin isn't as iconic. Even if there are speach patterns that Scott Weinger did that stick in my head. It was decently performed. \n\nThe last real issue with the movie is that Guy Richie probably wanted to have a Bollywood feel. It is rather obvious. Every set felt small. Even the cave of wonders felt like a sound stage. The palace was the worst of these, though. LITERALLY EVERYTHING felt small and claustrophobic. Maybe that is the wanted motif, but it is pretty distracting to me. Disney has the money to get real location shots. Why not use them? The only reason I can come up with is that Richie really wanted a Bollywood feel. In which case, he nailed it. There is one scene when Prince Ali comes into Agrabah and Genie turns into a woman on a balconey... That scene reminded me of a low budget remake that belonged on the SyFy channel. It was not well shot or the CGI was horribly off or both. It looked made-for-tv.\n\nAll in all, if the 2 new songs were removed completely and the story was spread out a bit more like the original, this would be a great retelling of a classic story and one so many gen x-ers and millenials have known for almost 30 years. It is better than I thought it would be and Will Smith, while still not a singer, definitely did wonderful in his role. I'm sure that was a tough thing to do. He had pretty big shoes to fill and I believe he did his best to fill them and do so with respect. \n\nUltimately, I am glad that I watched this film and if the original didn't exist or was out of print or something, I could see my child growing up with this version. However, the original does exist and much like the lion king, this was a fun trip to take, but you are asking me to make room for a flawed movie while removing a classic animated masterpiece. Sorry, not gonna happen. But you tried and did some good things. I'd rent, but I wouldn't buy this movie. ",

The trailers for this movie didn't convince me. Now, this wasn't as good as the original, it would be impossible to top the incredible film, and of course it starred Robin Williams, who was incredible. But this movie was worthy, and Will Smith did a good job as the Genie. He did a good job of following up such an iconic character played by such an iconic actor. But yeah, I would say he was very good. Naomi Scott really shines as Jasmine, I thought she did a pretty good job as well. Mena Massoud was fine as the title character, but he wasn't anything worth really talking about. My biggest complaint is Marwan Kenzari as Jafar. He gives a pretty lifeless performance as the ruthless villain, although it's not all on his part, as he's very poorly written. Also, the three animal characters (Abu, Iago, Raja) don't show any emotion like they did in the animated predecessor, due to the fact that they look photorealistic. Also, some of the singing in this movie sounded very auto tuned, you could definitely tell when the performers weren't actually singing. The cinematography in this movie I thought was pretty good, and I think Guy Ritchie did a good job directing. The choreography was done well too.",

            "content": "Well, I saw this for some reason. I guess I just like to suffer. This movie is really bad! It has no reason to exist! Everything it does well was done better in the original and everything that the original did well is done much worse here! Now, when you think of the original Aladdin, what comes to mind? Probably the incredibly rich and colourful and energetic animation with great comedic timing and Robin Williams' incredible performance as the Genie. Well, obviously this new movie isn't animated so you don't have any of that and Robin Williams is dead so you don't have that either. Instead of the beautifully-crafted hand-drawn animation, you get very flat-looking and washed-out environments and some very crappy CGI. Instead of Robin Williams improvising most of his lines and talented Disney animators giving life to his words, you get Will Smith being slightly charming and slightly comedic, which is pretty much every Will Smith performance for the past 20+ years! Also, instead of Looney Tunes-style visual gags and slapstick, you get cringe humour. Not cringy humour, cringe humour, which is an actual style of comedy most often found in sitcoms like The Office. Cringe humour can be great if done well, but it can fail spectacularly if not done well. This was not done well. It wasn't very funny. It was just awkward. What is even the point of watching this if the best parts of the original movie that arguably are the reason it is so beloved do not translate at all? Okay, so the comedy doesn't work, but how are the other actors? Well, the rest of the performances were honestly pretty bad, especially the guy playing Jafar. He is not threatening in the slightest! He just sounds monotone and bored. He just wasn't the right actor for the role. His facial features are too soft and his voice is too high-pitched. Not great villain material if not written correctly. The guy playing Aladdin just felt awkward, which kind of works sometimes for when he's turned into a prince, but his performance still feels awkward even in the scenes where he's supposed to be in his home element. He's supposed to be kind of a Han Solo type, he's a thief but he has a heart of gold, but in this he feels more like Scott Pilgrim. The girl playing Jasmine was probably the best actor in the movie, either her or Alan Tudyk as Iago, but in practically every scene she's in without Aladdin she's accompanied by her sidekick character. Not the tiger, a new character, her handmaiden. She was also very awkward and not very funny. I really don't understand the point of this character being in the movie at all. Okay, so the performances leave a lot to be desired, but how is the music? Also terrible! The new orchestrations of the old songs are made more modern and hip for the kids (With some rapping and beatboxing. No, really.) and the only person who can sing in the whole darn cast is the girl who plays Jasmine! Speaking of Jasmine, she also has a new song of her own which she sings really well, but the lyrics are not very good and it seems very out of place with the rest of the songs. It doesn't sound like Aladdin, it sounds more like The Greatest Showman. Probably because it was written by the same people who did The Greatest Showman. Now, I haven't seen that movie, but I am not a fan of the songs from that film. They sound way too poppy and not enough like musical theatre for my liking and the lyrics I think are just awful, but at least all the songs were like that in The Greatest Showman. In Aladdin, it just does not fit at all. The effects during the song were cool though, or at least they would be if I didn't see literally the exact same thing before in Into the Woods and Avengers: Infinity War. That's most of this movie's problems summed up. No matter what it does, there is always another movie that does it better. Overall, this movie is an embarrassment. It's a complete and utter waste of time. It's pointless! Just stay home and watch the original! It's shorter (Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, the remake is over 2 hours long! The original is under 90 minutes! It's full of padding. It even ends with a big dance party scene like a DreamWorks movie. And it shows Aladdin and Jasmine getting married! What the heck?? They aren't supposed get married until the third movie, after a direct-to-VHS sequel and a TV series!) and it is better in every way! It's colourful, energetic, hilarious and a ton of fun! This is boring, tired, unfunny and frustrating. Do not watch this movie! Please! Stop supporting this lazy, creatively-bankrupt crap! The only reason I did was because this movie has already made over a billion dollars and there is nothing I can do to affect its financial performance at this point. Also, OVER A BILLION DOLLARS????? People actually LIKE this????? Why?? It's the same movie we've all seen over 2 decades ago only worse! I do not understand the appeal of these remakes at all. If you like these Disney remakes, please tell me why. I'm curious. Why would you ever want to watch them when you could just watch the original movie again and get a better viewing experience? I'd love to know. Anyway, those are my thoughts on the new Aladdin and also my thoughts on the new The Lion King. Even though I haven't seen The Lion King, I have a feeling that most of my criticisms of this also apply to that movie, but I'll see it at the dollar cinema just to be sure. Stay tuned.",

            "content": "Some unkind and unjust words have been thrown at the 2019 remake of Aladdin, and I just want to clear a couple of things up and apologize on behalf of white people everywhere.   There will necessarily be spoilers for reasons that will become clear, so if you haven't seen the movie please dodge this review.  First of all, I identified with the 1992 movie and preferred it over the original Lion King, even though the nineties Lion King made more money and was more widely acclaimed than the nineties Aladdin.  That means that I had a lot more at stake in trying to get emotionally invested in the 2019 remake of Aladdin than in the 2019 remake of the Lion King.  I didn't like the new Lion King at all, even though I really tried to.  I loved the new Aladdin.\n   The most prevalent word that was thrown at the 2019 Aladdin remake was \u2018unnecessary.'  Back in the nineties all of these Disney movies were almost entirely white washed.  For the remake by contrast, nearly all of the major roles went to the appropriate and historical races they ought to have gone to.  And so on that ideal alone, the new movie stands as a testament to how far we've come as a human species since the nineties, which simply wasn't all that long ago.  It says a lot that the roles for these remakes no longer go to the heart throb from Home Improvement or the love interest from Full House anymore.  Now they go to real non-white actors in Hollywood who have been in real and successful movies and who in all reality have just as much charisma as the original white actors from these original movies.   When Donald Glover reprises Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Mathew freaking Broderick (the whitest Lion King that ever did Lion), the limitation that makes Glover's performance fall flat is the animation choices of a white guy, namely Happy Hogan's John Favreau, not any failing of Donald Glover's acting.  And likewise, when Mena Massoud dances or gives that sly smile to Jasmine, he's got miles of soul and charm that Dj Tanner's love interest could never have dreamt of translating to the silver screen.  Sorry white people, but facts are facts. \n     This actually is exactly what makes Will Smith's Genie casting make sense.  I'm not saying that it couldn't have gone to a white guy, but if it did, it would probably need to go to a real Jewish white guy instead of an \u2018Honorary Jew.'  Everybody lauds Robin William's performance as the thing that caused the original movie to transcend traditional benchmarks, but let's all just go ahead and stick to those benchmarks for just a moment.  The Genie needs to go to someone so world wise and who is such an old soul that big names like Will Smith or Robin Williams are the only names that even remotely make sense.  I'm not saying that recasting the entire cast with racially appropriate actors will win every time in my book, because the 2019 Lion King remake gets about a 20% rating from me, but it's a really good start.  \n     And I'm just going to go ahead and say it, making the statement that Will Smith can't sing in 2019 is just distasteful and racist at this point, and when you see review after review of top critics saying that Will Smith can't sing it shows a person that racism is still alive and well in this day and age.  I would venture to guess that there is a certain white rapper that would like to have a word with you all about your backwards views of the world.  Just because Will Smith doesn't sing the way you want him to doesn't mean he doesn't have a talent for singing.  When he raps about his kids in his platinum album that you all never achieved, that in my book is just as poignant as any aria from Josh Groban and it doesn't matter to me at all who can hit what note.  Singing is singing and talent is talent, and so therefore rapping is singing and beat-boxing is talent, and the color that divergent styles add to music is exactly what makes the world such a beautiful place to live in.  The problem might not even be that the movie was bad, the problem for some of these reviewers might be that an Arabic story about Arabian Knights told by white people and sung about by white people is no longer told by white people and no longer sung about by white people and that rubs white people the wrong way.  \n     As for how Will Smith holistically approached the role, forgoing William's manic for his own laid back style made him a new Genie for a new generation to love and a previous generation to appreciate, whereas if he had tried to sing Robin William's songs it would have been a mistake right out of the gate.  In every other way Smith chose to honor Robin William's turn while adding his own personality and whit to the role instead of completely recasting the character.  These turned out to be perfect choices, by Smith and by Disney. \n    The second ideal that the movie stands on is on the idea of a female becoming a Sultan.  It helps for one to realize that the faction of Islam that would ever accept a female as a Sultan is at least as much of a fringe faction of Islam as the faction that decided it would be a good idea to fling Aeroplanes at buildings with white people still inside of the aeroplanes and the buildings.  That makes Disney's statement about strong female leads a bold statement about human decency and achievement, and I found at least a couple of the tonal notes of Aladdin to be just as poignant as Marvel's Black Panther in hitting a relevant and applaudable (and plausible) resonance with today's audience.  And I just have to say as a white person that if I can learn even a little bit about Arabic culture in a movie like Aladdin, or about Black American or African culture in a movie like Black Panther, then white people can sit and complain about those sorts of movies all day and they won't move me at all.  \n   This movie is in good taste, and in good company for that reason alone.  The biggest new musical number that they added that everyone says they hated is a song about just exactly that; about an Arabic woman who refuses to stay silent.  And I for one love the song and I don't see what's wrong with it.   In just a few moments of brilliant dialogue Naomi Scott manages to move us to understand, even for just a moment what it might be like to be Arabic woman whose life is put in danger just because of the gender she was born with. And believe me when I say, I am just as tired as everyone else at the prospect of feminist idealism and social justice being flung on the top of every movie for good measure.  I was ready to complain along with everyone else about how kubrickian that theme seems at this point and why it would be needful to add it to Aladdin when the original Aladdin was already a feminist's dream movie.  But at the end of the day it works, and if that's all you can say about Aladdin in 2019, then this movie was a rousting success in my book.  \n      Maybe these Disney remakes aren't the thing that is unnecessary, maybe what is unnecessary is the entire site and staff of Rotten Tomatoes and its undying need to compare every new movie to old ways of thinking and old movies.  I know we're in this mode of retreading every old idea, and that mode definitely has its downsides, but at the end of the day, young people need to see the value in antiquated ideas, and old people need to see the diamonds in the rough that are placed in these new movies for what they are.  If that idealism fails then the rift between the generations will grow ever larger, and human understanding will diminish.  These new ideas from a new generation, these gems that can be found in re-released movies, these diamonds in the rough are far from unnecessary.  They are necessary.\n    Disney's new narration of Aladdin gives the world a new and better narrative of what it means to be American in 2019.  It gives a pretty smashing narrative of what it means to be Arabic in 2019, for that matter. And, most telling, far from being \"a whole old world,\" that is exactly the note that Disney was able to hit that causes 2019's Aladdin to smash old benchmarks and become \"a whole new world,\" and a new voice for a new generation of movie goers.\n",

            "content": "This is yet another attempt by disney to remake beloved classics that don't need to be remade, and after viewing this film, I can safely say that the animated original is way better than this remake, and it is the only Aladdin movie that we will ever need. Let's get into the nitty gritty then, shall we. First off, the runtime for this movie is just to long and they constantly have to keep making up new things to increase the runtime, but this really didn't need that extra content that was added in, it became very boring. The performances were all weak, save Naomi Scott who is really trying in this movie and she is almost as good in this film as her animated self in the original movie. Mena Massoud was just too full of himself in this role and he felt overbearing, he just didn't do the character of Aladdin justice at all. Marwan Kenzari was pretty bad in this movie, he was not menacing at all and the evil parts of his character felt very forced and unnatural, he even said some dumb things that just sucked, he wasn't so bad that he ticked me off, but he was really laughable in this film. Iago and Raja were really wasted in this film, they both did nothing of any significance except preview what the Lion King remake looks like, great CGI, but emotionless characters who don't belong anywhere but the animated world. Will Smith as the genie was surprisingly good, when he was blue and flying, he tried too much to be Robin Williams, but when he was pretending to be a human, he was the most entertaining part of this film. Smith also has a good singing voice and he delivers on the Arabian Nights song in the beginning. The songs in this movie all feel out of place and like they are interrupting the story, they were all done so much better in the original. Ultimately, this is a film of mediocrity, it is too long, has some terrible dialogue and performances, and most of the songs in this movie ruin the beloved ones in the original. The saving graces in this film are Naomi Scott, and Will Smith, this movie would be nothing without them. If you hold the original near and dear to your heart, then you will not like this remake, I recommend to skip over this one, but if your into over the top musicals with terrible characters, than be my guest. As for me, I don't think that I will ever have any desire to rewatch this at all, it was very disappointing and boring, and it kind of ruined a beloved movie of mine that I grew up with.     ",

The breath of fresh air was the new character of Dalia portrayed by Nasim Pedrad, as a love interest for The Genie. Disney, if you're going to continue down the path of remaking animated classics as life action movies, do some justice to the films and characters and maybe considering casting Broadway cast members who can act, sing, and dance, you know, triple threat performers, instead of casting generic look alike actors with no screen or stage presence.

It is by far the best version of the fictional kingdom I have ever seen. The music was bigger and better than the original.

            "content": "Review:\n\u2018Aladdin' is an American musical-fantasy film directed by Guy Ritchie. It is a live-action adaptation of Disney's 1992 animated film of the same name. Upon watching this movie, I was skeptical due to the fact I didn't believe they would be able to capture the same magic that the 1992 animated film had. At times this movie really shined, but that didn't happen until the second and third act. I was almost ready to turn the movie off after the first act. It didn't grasp your attention at all, and everything was lackluster and boring.\nThe film follows Aladdin (Mena Massoud) a street urchin, as he falls in love with Princess Jasmine (Naomi Scott) befriends a wish-granting Genie (Will Smith) and battles the wicked Jafar (Marwan Kenzari).\nThis movie didn't take off at all until Will Smith was introduced. His charisma and funny attitude towards Aladdin and certain situations were amazing. He stole every scene he was in and basically saved this movie from a bad review. I could care less about the other characters in this movie aside from Genie, Aladdin and Jasmine. Jaffar, who is supposed to be this big bad was not scary or menacing at all and I do believe that is because the actor did not have what it takes to pull the character off. It just fell flat. I really enjoyed Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott's portrayal as Aladdin and Jasmine. Their chemistry together was real, and it felt like the characters could come off the screen and live in the real world. However, as I said the rest of the characters fell short and you don't care what happens or even remember who they are when they come on screen another time.\nI told myself I would not be comparing this to the 1992 animated film, but it's hard not to compare Genies. Will Smith did a great job in this movie and took on what was thought to be an impossible role and made it his own. I did still find myself missing Robin Williams when it came to the music numbers. I will say what I liked the most with this movie is the ending. Man did it stick the landing on that ending. It made you feel so many emotions. Now, I'm not one to complain about CGI when it's from a movie that has a low budget such as an Indie film or even a B-rate production company. When it's Disney and you see things like Marvel or The Lion King you know they can produce good CGI and this movie fell short in that aspect.\nOverall, this movie fell hard in the first act and was lucky people stuck around for the second and third because the movie does a 180 turn and takes off. If you want a fun adventure film this one will do that for sure, and if you're a fan of the original this one keeps its core values as well as throwing in some fresh elements.\n3/5",

He doesn come over bad at all almost like a buddy to Aladdin.\n\nWhat me really disturbed was the picturing of Jasmin. She is nothing like in the originals. She comes over like the actual villain. She wants desperately to rule the country, she wants to do so and succeed her father while he is still alive and currently ruling and her argument for doing so despite having 0 experience in ruling is because she read some books - what the heck were they thinking??\nIt doesnt come over like she has deep interest  for Aladdin at all. Its more like she rules over the country and has a short flirt with that Aladdin dude.\nSpoiler:\nThat made me really sad, in the original the sultan changed the laws so that a princess could choose whatever man she likes to be in love with. In this movie the sultan changes the law so a women can also rule.\nIts not about love and friendship , its all about the greed for power. Bad thing to teach our kids.\n\n-1 star for Jaffar actor\n-1 for this unworthy Jasmin storyline",

You would  think it would be better since they literally only have to mime the original lol. Its already been done, but these guys still play the roles like freshman drama club.  A long list of newbie actors and a couple veteran has beens.  Their acting skill is juvenile at best. Like watching a Jr High play. Which is why they overpaid for Will Smith, thinking his name and the edgy move of making a purple Genie that speaks Yiddish out of the Fresh Prince of Bel Aire might carry the film. It may work with the 8th graders but it doesnt for someone who knows better. In fact thats the biggest fail I can see.... the casting! For example: \nThe Vizier is the highest office in the land advising the Sultan in everything. Should and would be someone older than the Sultan probably,  as it was in the original.  This one used a 36 year old that looks 25 lol. He carried none of the sneaky qualities of Jafar. \nThen theres Lago, Jafars parrot. The voice of this actor holds nothing  to Gilbert Godfrey lol. And then theres the Genie. Ill only say that going from middle aged character comedian that gives the character a Yiddish style to a rapper/action star. I couldnt even watch the whole movie.

It was also really fast paced in many scenes so the emotion they were trying to build was cut off quickly.

It's a remake, but it's obviously never going to be exactly the same. Accept it! I loved it! Aladdin has been my favorite Disney movie since 1992 when I was in second grade and i loved all the wonderful ways they weaved the animated film into this live-action. I love the way they updated the story. I love Aladdin. He was perfect. So handsome, so charming, a good heart, so perfect. I couldn't stop smiling when I saw it in theaters, and my face hurt afterwards. The thing I was most surprised about was Will. I love Will Smith and always have, but I was worried I would hate his portrayal of The Genie. I was pleasantly surprised to see him change the role just the right amount, and even add depth. I could go on and on. I would give it more than 5 stars if I could! ",

Will Smith's version can't even compare to Robin Williams', but he does an admirable job despite looking a bit weird as a big blue CGI Genie (which was still cool). I like the changes they did from the original film, though Gilbert Gottfried's voice was sorely missed. The cast was good, and I actually thought that despite the criticism, the cast was ethnically appropriate. The music was good, especially the Genie's songs, but they don't come close to the original songs in terms of legacy, but they do a good job of continuing the legacy.",

And she can definitely sing! I didn't care for Marwan Kenzari as Jafar. He just didn't look good in a turban and I didn't enjoy his portrayal of Jafar. The costumes were incredible, especially for Princess Jasmine. Will Smith's interpretation of the genie started out a little rough, but won me over before the end of the movie. He's just so darn likeable and adorable. I like everything Will Smith does. Mena Massound was  gorgeous and charming as Aladdin - singing and dancing was just okay.I would have liked to see some real dancing from all of them.

They doubled the run time of the film, it was so painfully slow, it felt like it was never going to end; filling it with unnecessary dialogue, unnecessary new characters, and added terribly written new songs to fit the new storyline. This wasn't Aladdin's story, with all of the changes that directly affected the plot, they should have changed the films name to Jasmine. \n\nThe actress who played Jasmine was the only decent actor, besides Abu and Carpet. Not only was they guy who played Aladdin a bad actor, but he didn't embody Aladdin at all. Aladdin is supposed to be charming, it seemed as though there wasnt any chemistry between him amd Jasmine; the only reason she married him was because he supported her rule as Sultan. \n\n Also, there will never be another Robin Williams, but it would have been nice if they picked a genie that actually had a range of voices and comedic impressions. Will Smith wasn't terrible, he did the best with what he had, but he's incapable of bringing even a fraction of what Robin brought to the role.",

While most Disney live-action films tend to be exactly the same for audiences, Aladdin had plenty of fresh content to make the film worth seeing. One of the changes I especially enjoyed was the changes made to Jasmine character. She is given a lot more dept and much more to do. One of the weaker aspects of the film was Jafar.  His character was overall weak and lacked the sinister feeling he had in the original. \n\nSecondly, Will Smith as the Genie! The Genie was heavily criticized in the marketing for the film. However, he respected Robin and made the character his own. He sparks plenty of humor and the \"Friend Like Me\" aspect was truly a pleasure to look at. He was overall funny and filled with endless energy. \n\nThirdly, Mena Massoud was an excellent choice for Aladdin! Just as most people, myself included, I was not sure about how I felt about Mena portraying the charming street rat. However, he proved me wrong and did it in an excellent style. Also, another great aspect I would method would be Naomi Scott as the lovely Jasmine. She was excellent and was given so much life by her. Jasmine new song Speechless was a delight to hear. \n\nIn conclusion, I felt myself smiling half of the time. The whole movie, besides Jafar, was a win for me. Aladdin may not be my favorite classic (The Lion King is which is why the remake was so disappointing) but this is for sure my favorite live-action to date! \n\nAladdin gets an A -",

Maybe not expecting much meant that it was a brilliant hit of nostalgia coupled with genuine unease as I couldn't remember how the original ended and couldn't guess how this one would.\n\nCast were spot on. Will Smith put me off watching it initially but he made me eat my words. He made it his own. \n\nThe plot surrounding Jasmine felt genuine and relevant. Not like an SJW effort but a genuine commentary on how certain parts of the World view women still.\n\nThe guy playing Aladdin was perfect. And Jasmines maid steals every scene she's in. Just brilliant. A timeless story retold lovingly for a modern audience.\n\nAll these people complaining that Disney is cashing in on its characters miss the point. We're living in a golden age of CGI where stories that could only be told with animation can now be painted in fabulously realistic detail. So why not?  \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \n\nOne of my favourite Disney movies brought to life in a brightly coloured splash of nostalgia. The critics really do need to cheer up and take things for what they are. This movie had heart and was a love letter to the original. Disney magic as always...but probably one the best Disney remakes I've seen so far. Definitely as good as Beauty and The Beast.\n\n97% Audience score says it all.",

The final 20-ish minutes are completely different than the original, and end up being about Jasmine and the genie and not about that main character.

It was a muted, badly sung version...Will Smith, as the genie- i didn't hate that, but he just does not have the vocal range for the music. They tried to blind you with pa-zazz and it almost worked because those dance sequences were great, but everything that made the original special- was made dim by so-so acting, people whose voices are not made for the music they were singing...ie Aladdin the overproduced auto-tune extraordinaire. Jasmine's new song was bleh, and I just left that movie cringing and I dont ever want to have that feeling in association with something that I loved in childhood. I was going to watch the Lion King- but the track record with these remakes so far, has been abismal so I think I'm just going to quit while the getting is good. I heard they are coming out with my favorite disney movie, The Little Mermaid, and at this point I'm pretty sure they are going to ruin that too. Let's hope they lay off the auto-tune or get someone who can actually sing. These are musicals. I can go to Disneyland and pick any cast member who sings, and they will be ten times better than these people you are finding for these movies. Fame isn't everything. Okay, rant over-- for now.",

But after seeing it twice, I can verfifiably say I not only enjoyed it for its fun and enthusiastic take on the story, but was seriously impressed by the feminist tone the movie took. Princess Jasmine went from a pretty passive character, controlled by the will's of the men in her life, to someone who has desires, goals, and doesn't wait for someone to let her do anything. As the song goes, Jasmine speaks up and becomes the Sulton without anyone allowing her to. Because she is right for the role, she steps up as the leader of her people to protect them from Jafar before her father acknowledges her strenght and leadership qualities by giving her his ring and bestowign Sulton-hood upon her, or however that offically goes. Naomi Scott won a gold medal for feminist role-models in my book. It was also a fun watch for the songs and dances. Will Smith did an admirable job filling some of the film world's most roomy footwear. Aladdin himself was great if outshone a bit by Jasmine in this one in my opinion, but all in all it was a fun watch and a great step in the right direction for representing disney princesses as more empowered leaders.",
