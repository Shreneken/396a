In what looks like Madurai, and has Tamizh writing on walls and signboards, the back ground chatter in this yet-another-firang-made-movie-about-India is in Hindi!!! Yep. that'll happen! \ud83d\ude02 And when people finally begin to speak in Tamizh, the clueless and presumably brainless and extremely lazy person who did the subtitles tells us (speaking Bengali)... Whaaaat? The film casting opened with shots of a South Indian temple and tank where a  white woman was teaching meditation, and the background chants coming from the temple were the famous Maharadshtrian song in praise of Ganesh, \"jai dev jai dev jai Mangal murti\" which is in Marathi!!!!... Is the film maker and entire crew labouring under the misconception that all indians speak the same language? Or that the languages are geographically interchangeable??? Looks like this is going to be one of those....\n\nI stand corrected. The subtitler is obviously stone deaf and working by guesswork, because recitation of Johnny Johnny, yes papa, by a bunch of kids, is also \"singing in Bengali\" and all other speech both Hindi and Tamizh are marked as (speaking in Bengali) as someone who speaks all 5 of these languages, I feel particularly outraged!!! oh my god!!!!!!!!!",

I felt like this Sundance hit would have been better suited as an evening weeper from the Lifetime Channel.  The script feels concocted to solely move the audience to feel this way, and then sway them another way. Great cinema should have to tell you how to feel.  Instead it allows you to feel many different waysbased on your own point of  view. This is an admirable effort, but just not enough true life heart to carry it along.",

If there are moms out there who regret giving up on their kids or abandoning them and find themselves stalking on their children - how ironic that she becomes attached to another kid in India and never for once is being shown at least just longing for someone, her daughter this time and wondering perhaps what she looks like now or whoever adopted her or if she is having a good set of parents, happy family life. ??? And just being grateful to the adoptive mom instead of being so doubting of her intentions when it comes to giving out the donation for the kids in India. She should be a 100% thinking of what it will do to the kids instead of fretting and entertaining differently of any doubtful acceptance. Hope this review strikes a chord in the heart. :-) :-(",

But Michelle Williams is so magnetic, we can't take out eyes off of her. And Billy Crudup turns in yet another fine performance after one in \"Where'd you go, Bernadette?\" Spoilers within: Abby Quinn does a nice job of being a spoiled upper-crust kid/adult, and the wonderful Julianne Moore is the most downside surprising, turning emotional into primal scream,melodramatic overwrought, though her challenge is indeed her life and death. But this can be psychologically sophisticated because we are in a milieu of the rich and comfortable, Julianne a company founder, chief, with a thousand employees and a bank account to match her status, enough to donate $20 mil to charity, and her hubby Billy an A-list sculptor. So the psych angle can dominate, not a struggle to survive. But the counterpoint is the poverty of India, where Michelle pulls kids off the streets and puts them into a haven of school and residence. Not sure I've seen a story that relies on this level of manipulation based on who Michelle is in relation to Billy (ex-wife) and birth mother of Billy's child who did not know Billy kept the child two decades ago when Michelle left for India. Sparks fly when Julianne brings in Michelle under pretense of donating to her orphanage. But Julianne is really using leverage to get Michelle to stay in New York with Billy and Abby. Michelle's Sophie's choice is: Do I give up my fulfilling life with the kids in India so the orphanage gets $20 mil, or do I stay with them and forgo the $20 mil for them? You can guess what choice Michelle makes. But I won't spoil why Julianne made Michelle make the choice, though I may have already spoiled it above. A sophisticated tale of manipulation, rich-poor world, love of others vs. doing what one wants to, and of love, marriage, betrayal and, ultimately, redemption. Well worth the effort with few false notes.",

At a time when too many movies try to exploit the ugly sides of people, this movie deals with perhaps some real issues and how good-hearted people deal with adversity.  Only negative is Michelle Williams' character who was hard to like as who would question so much trying to get $$$ for an orphanage. Overall this movie is awesome and will make you think about the true meaning and value of your own life.",

            "content": "Good acting and a casually interesting mystery don't quite make up for a lack of gripping or affecting drama in 'After the Wedding,' an American remake of the Oscar-nominated Danish film of the same name. Centered around Michelle William's Isabel, a woman running an orphanage in India, the film follows the only mildly developed, emotionally walled-off character on a trip to New York as she goes to meet a wealthy benefactor, Theresa, who is making a more than generous donation to her cause. Ghosts of the past are dug up when Isabel is urged by Theresa, played by Julianne Moore, to attend her daughter's wedding, where she ends up running into a man from her past and unearths an occurrence she previously thought had been buried forever.\n\nThe film follows through decently on its promised revelations, just not with enough oomph to keep one's attention for maybe more than half of its two-hour runtime. Moore does well in her role, and while there are some pointed enough character moments for both Theresa and Williams, their story starts to fall off as soon as all the details are put on the table, maybe even sooner than that. Not ever fully invested in the film, I found myself skittish and ready for it to end sooner than I'd care to admit.",

This is a film for grown-ups, and will connect most with those who have lived a few decades, and have had some hard knocks along the way but are doing their best not to withdraw and become bitter about life. A story of survival, growth, forgiveness, and the willingness to try, with quiet connection, to understand those around you before reacting to their actions that, at first, hurt you deeply. This is a film that will mean a lot to moviegoers who have burned out on much of what, as they are watching this film, is being shown around them on most of the other screens at the multiplex. The level of acting on display, even in the smallest roles, is alone worth the price of admission.",
