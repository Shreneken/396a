What drives this movie is Hrithik Roshan's convincing and likable lead performance. His character is easy to empathize with and understand. I did feel the story does a dip in quality in the second half and does drag a little bit. I also thought the story jumped from plot point to plot point somewhat quickly at times and it could feel a bit jarring. Despite some minor storytelling flaws,\u00a0 this is still a very good movie with an important statement about being born with or without certain levels of privilege that are relevant for everyone to hear.",

But was surprised that it did reasonably well at the box office, so gave it a shot. Hrithik did well. It was hard to imagine it's the same actor as War. The supporting cast was good too. The storyline in ridiculous though and the editing choppy as hell. I wanted to root for the kids, but the whole thing weirdly felt like an exercise in exploiting them. Some good issues raised, but this topic deserved a movie with better writing and actual nuance. Hard to believe it was the same director as the gem, Queen. Anyway, save your sanity and read some well-researched articles on the topic. This movie isn't going to provide any real insight.",

Imitating that person's Body Language, Linguistic Expressions, Verbal Annotations is something that's easier said than done. Many of them failed to being realistic and justifying to the real life person! But I'm happy to say that's not the case with Hrithik Here!\n\nHe has done tremendously well with his character. With his emotions, expressions and language ; Everything felt relatable and believable.\n\nCamera Work, Direction, Sound Score, Screenplay all the things have justified the premise of the film. But In some aspects some things have fallen apart even for a little bit of time.\n\nThe main problem lies with the Character Development of the other characters except the main Lead Anand Kumar. His family, His rival or His group of students. Everyone's part in the story felt underwhelming or should I say restricted for the sake of Hrithik's Character being the center of attention.\n\nAll the focus have been diverted to the Main Lead and his life struggles, Achivements, Vulnerabilities etc. But we never got the same treatment or could connect well to the other cast members at all! Though they gave their pretty best respectively.\n\nJust for example the group of 30 students who should have been the sole focus of the film have been left out in characterization department. None of the students among them shined or would be remembered for their own backstories and weaknesses. The makers summed up the whole group as one and wrote the Screenplay accordingly.\n\nKind of Unfortunate If yoh take my opinion as it had so much promising aspects in it.\n\nAnother issue here is its longer duration, I don't usually have complaints about the runtimes but If they are not being utilized properly then the unnecessary scenes must be cut short so that the story itself feels more compact and tighter on the scale.\n\nIn the end, As a Biopic it's a really good one, For the Hrithik Fans it would be a Treat for sure. And For the Casual Movie Goers ; Might not be the best but would not bore you either I assure.",
