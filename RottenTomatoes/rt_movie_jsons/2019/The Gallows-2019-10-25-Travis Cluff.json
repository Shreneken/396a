The ending is better then the ending of the 1st movie. The acting may be alittle poor and the film seems alittle poor itself but also it is a decent enough sequel. Will have to give it a 3 out of 5.",

            "content": "This one was bad. I kinda knew & accepted that it was going to be bad going into it, but even in that frame of mind, this one was still pretty bad. The acting wasn't the worst, but far from the best. I feel like the writing was done by 3 or 4 different people who never talked to each other. The effects were decent, not great, but passable. The world-building was garbage. But the biggest problem is it starts out as one movie and ends up another kind of movie. If you watch it you'll get what I'm talking about, but I'm not recommending that, so ... screw it, I'll just tell you ... the movie starts out as a supernatural thriller/horror movie and ends up a totally non-supernatural psychological thriller. It's that old chestnut, \"You thought it was ghosts, but it was just people, you idiots\"! Now to be clear that's a workable premise. It's been done before and been entertaining. However they failed to maintain the rules of the world they built. Like in the first half of the movie there's some very clear supernatural stuff that happens that cannot have a natural explanation for the way it was presented on-screen, and with the information they provided us. Then they end the movie with *SURPRISE* that was all just BS! It's like a \"gotcha moment\" stretched out into a crappy movie, and it just doesn't pay off in any satisfying way, and frankly insults the audience's intelligence. In order for everything to happen the way that it was presented on-screen would require more than just \"dumb luck\", there needs to be like a genie or a monkey's paw involved to get all those dominos to fall in place. There's \"suspension of disbelief\" and there's whatever the heck this nonsense is. Glad I didn't pay actual money to see this one.",

Its not like it's a classic, but it was ok for a horror. Some things that don't make sense at the end though. The ending was interesting but the movie maker's  get a bit too ambitious and abandon the concept of  \"how to have a story that makes sense\" ,  in exchange for completely wild twists that aren't well thought out  . In turn we get some noticeable plot holes.",

In reality, its executed quite well as the found footage vibe of the 1st film transitions to a new story shot in the usual film manner, which was great.  Anna, the main character, get caught up in the mystique of the old theater play The Gallows and the ghostly happenings that go with it.  The film is eerie throughout with good performances and an unexpected ending.  I actually thought it was a vast improvement on the original.   Everything created by Blumhouse is awesome!",

We follow a high schooler named Auna Rue (Ema Horvath) who is the new kid at school. She joins the drama class and absolutely does terrible her first day. Auna finds the play for 'The Gallows' in the school library and becomes enthralled with it. She finds a monologue in it which she performs almost as if she's always known the words her whole life. Meanwhile Auna then finds out there's an internet challenge involving the play where strange occurrences happen when you read from the book in the dark (ooo spooky). Auna has a bit of a following on Youtube, but man this is making my head hurt typing this up. Auna starts to see the ghost of the kid that died originally during the making of 'The Gallows' play named Charlie. Spooky stuff happens and jump scares happen. Anyways, don't watch this one. It's terrible. The acting is as if everyone was just reading off queue cards and the film has a somewhat twist at the end that doesn't make any sense. Avoid this one!",

Turns out, that even though Act II dropped my biggest problem with the first movie, it was still somehow worse.",
