            "content": "The story is not so simple — a bunch of engineering students and their journey from being losers to choosers. No that's the cover. Its other important purpose is hidden underneath it. The students, especially the iit aspirants and they connect with this movie.\nSushant and his batchmates show us an ode to college-time friendships, romances, ragging, fights, competitions and countless memories. Enough to take you on a nostalgic cycle. But was this recollection for? It was for his 'failed son'? was it not? had he really failed? was his hardwork and effort all in vain?\nThis is where this movie subtly hits and hits fiercely. It shows that effort and hardwork always pays, maybe not always the winner, but a loser either. This may seem common sense to you. but India had a student population of 3.74 crores in higher education in FY2019. And 22 lakhs students applied for JEE for 12,000 seats in IIT's in 2022. See the cruel ratio? which one of the 22 lakh students have not made effort for getting into JEE? how many parents emptied there savings to get their child best coaching?\nThe rest after the 12,000 selected, what about them? are they destined to be 'failures'? well No, there are countless success stories out of IIT's.\nBut the applicants dont know it, they are vey much crushed under the pressure. This films motivates them, tells them it's not the end and your efforts weren't in vain.\nThank you Sushant Singh Rajput. RIP.",

The power of friendship in adversity and challenge. Besides one of the last great performances of the dearly missed SSR. Fantastic movie, you can conquer anything if you conquer self doubt.",
