    "summary": "Actor Rick Dalton gained fame and fortune by starring in a 1950s television Western, but is now struggling to find meaningful work in a Hollywood that he doesn't recognize anymore. He spends most of his time drinking and palling around with Cliff Booth, his easygoing best friend and longtime stunt double. Rick also happens to live next door to Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate -- the filmmaker and budding actress whose futures will forever be altered by members of the Manson Family.",

It is alternative history and how something as small as what happens can change historical narrative and history forever. It is a fascinating and great concept that just may be above the general watcher. The ending sequence is so amazingly coordinated and hilarious that you have to watch. I have re-watched this movie twice in a matter of weeks because I loved it so much.

The lack of a real storyline both makes the film feel both feel spontaneous and random, yet almost documentary like, as if you are discovering what will happen next at the same time as the characters. Tate, played by Margot Robbie is a seemingly small and unexplored character within the film, yet her contrast with Di Caprio's character and their differing experiences of Hollywood make her an interesting asset to the movie none the less.  The ending scenes provide the most storyline the film is willing to give, but don't quite tie together the randomness of the preceeding hour of so of film. I don't believe this is necessarily a negative, as the characters, set and dialogue are compelling enough that the lack of a story never slips into the realms of being boring. In fact, the scenes of driving through 60s Los Angeles, along with Cliff Booth's undeniable cool factor and slick lines, make the film exciting and enjoyable even before the typical Tarrentino action ensues.",

This one certainly had probably the most laughs I've had at a Tarantino film and it's stuck with me more each time that I watched it\u2026when you go to the movies you want to be entertained and when you watch a Tarantino film, you know his primary goal is to take you into his movie world and give you an experience. The acting is phenomenal down to every single character. The dialogue is witty and smart, and the direction and photography along with the set design is sublime. And the best part is this really is a buddy film (  and you can feel the love between these two friends, Rick Dalton, and Cliff Booth.) Leo and Brad play them to perfection. Kudos that the Academy recognized Brad Pitt for his performance, but Leo was phenomenal as well and the direction and movie as a whole was just a blast. And it brought attention to an actress I really didn't know much about other than the Manson murders.  Margot Robbie was terrific as well in her portrayal of Sharon Tate . I certainly hope Tarantino is going to give us at least one more masterpiece before he hangs up his directors chair.",

At about 1 hour 45 minutes in, I finally started to perk up as it tended to focus more on the real lives of the people it was about. At one point before that I was about to turn it off.

I didn't cheer when the good guys killed the Nazis in Inglorious Bastards. I just found it completely stupid. Same with this horrible ending. Unless you are doing major world building then rewriting major historical events in isolation is just, really, really stupid and more then a little bit weird.\nOutside of that there is pretty much zero plot here. Just following around a has been actor and his tough guy lap dog until the final fever dream at the end. \nIt's DiCaprios worst performance in a while. The accent is just awful. \nPitt does more with a single look than 100 lines from DiCaprio. But then Pitts sycophantic, tough guy character is not very believable. To be believable he would have had to punch DiCaprio's character right in the face several times because no self respecting person would endure DiCaprios constant sniveling.\nMargot Robbie is in it but has so little screen time you'll forget all about her.

My only beef with any QT film is that he stays in that revenge zone a bit too long. It feels good to repay evil with suffering. The questions is: how much can a good person punish evil, without himself becoming evil? One effective head bash is sufficient in most cases, but doing it over and over just makes the protagonist look like a fiend. Perhaps QT has been holding up that mirror to teach that fact.

It's all like he's opening a number of luxury tin can food flavours to say: - Look what I can eat, and no surprise, it always ends in his signature, an orgy of violence. This is just not necessarily very impressing, if it ever was.

Centered around the relationship between fading actor Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his stuntman Cliff Booth, the film is a nostalgic look at Hollywood culture during the summer of 1969.  On the positive side, the characters are relentlessly interesting, the story is original, the acting is great, the dialogue is fantastic, the soundtrack is spot on, and Tarantino's visual style (lots of effective tracking shots, crane shots, etc) is evident at all times.  The primary negative issue is the bloated 159 minute running time, thanks to Tarantino's inclusion of scenes that are either too long or totally unnecessary and the ridiculous number of cutaway shots of the cultural detritus of the time, giving the impression that he is more interested in entertaining himself than he is in entertaining the audience.

The majority of the film is split between Leo DiCaprio's pitiable Rick Dalton, a former movie and tv cowboy star, now washed up and looking for a second wind; and his best friend/stuntman/chauffeur Cliff Booth, played by the always charismatic Brad Pitt. Together they go about their day-to-day lives in 1969 Hollywood, and really thats about it. The film masterfully plays with audiences expectations, especially those familiar with certain tragic events set to take place one fateful night in August involving Rick's neighbor, Sharon Tate, endearingly played by Margot Robbie. In Tarantino's Hollywood there is an ever-looming threat one cannot escape from, and not just from the hippies. One never truly feels safe, as though the ball could drop at any given moment, and Tarantino knows that we have come to expect this. So instead he builds up tension for 2 hours before pulling the figurative trigger and delivering exactly what we want.",

Although Quentin Tarantino's films have been spotty in recent years, his best work such as 'Reservoir Dogs' and especially 'Pulp Fiction' are masterpieces. The cast consists of many immensely talented actors. It looked great from the advertising and who cannot help resist that title. That it was one of the year's most positively received films further added to the interest.\n\nAlthough it is not quite perfect, 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' to me was as great as hoped. One of Tarantino's best in direction, writing and as a film as an overall whole in recent years, towards the better end of his filmography and one of 2019's best films, its positive reception richly deserved. It is unmistakable Tarantino in a good way and a great representation of the cast, with many giving some of their best work in recent years.\n\nWill start with the very, very few things that didn't quite come off for my tastes. Some of the pace, especially for a film as long as it was, could have tightened and not every scene felt necessary. Actually would have trimmed some or all of Sharon Tate in the cinema, regardless of how beguiling the production values and Margot Robbie's (that smile is a beauty) acting were.\n\nDid think too that the Bruce Lee caricature and encounter were quite tasteless and anybody who was offended can't be blamed.\n\nThat sounds like a film worth a 7 or 8 out of 10. The good things though were so amazing and the film was in a different league to a lot of films released this year that to me awarding 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' either of those scores felt too low. It looks wonderful, dazzlingly shot with shots filled to the brim with atmosphere, stylishly edited with a lovingly recreated period. Tarantino directs with great confidence and his distinctive style is all over it. The music is used sparingly, but the music choices are very effective when used. Particularly so the quite sinister use of \"Twelve Thirty\" in a scene that already makes one feel unnerved.\n\nScript has the hard-boiled edge necessary and has entertainment and intensity. A word of warning, there is a lot of profanity (am mentioning this because this is something that bothers people) but to me it didn't feel as gratuitous as feared. Some pacing issues aside, the story is often absorbing and is quite nostalgic and daring with expert melding of fact and fiction. A few great scenes are everything to do with the making of the western with Rick and the girl (fans of classic-era westerns will enjoy it, likewise anybody with super fond memories of episodic television), Cliff's truly chilling encounter at the Spahn Movie Ranch and the splendidly over the top (and extremely violent just to warn you) finale in true Tarantino style.\n\nFound the characters to be interesting, with Rick and Cliff being quite meaty roles. The acting is exemplary, Leonardo DiCaprio is charisma and intensity personified and Brad Pitt, here the epitome of cool, has not been this good in years. Margot Robbie is absolutely radiant with a smile that lights up the screen. Bruce Dern, Damian Lewis and Al Pacino provide delicious support in small roles.\n\nIn conclusion, the odd pacing issue and one tasteless scene aside this was a great film. 9/10",

It was just depressing.  Pitt's character was more interesting and was at least fun to watch when there was something happening and it wasn't just a long scene of him driving in the car.  I like Margot Robbie, but they didn't give her anything to do.  Not much of a story here, especially not to justify a 2 hour and 40 minute run time.  The ending was the only part that engaged my attention.  I thought they would at least use original music of the period.  I'm not sure why they used mostly bland covers.

However, quirky characters and excellent chemistry can only get you so far, as the pacing is truly god awful, the first 3 quarters of this movie are slow as molasses with barely any plot development, and then once we actually get to the final act, it switches into its highest gear and blazes through it at the speed of light.

Sure, there is a maturity to this film that shows growth, and there's no doubting that this is a movie that is probably more personal to QT than his other endeavours, but it's a difficult one to compare to the rest of his back catalogue.\n\nIt's certainly not gritty like Resevoir Dogs, or as cult as Pulp Fiction. It's not as comedic as Jackie Brown. Overall, it doesn't enthrall like these movies.\n\nThere are times when the film becomes too long in the tooth. Scenes showing the acting on set of Rick Dalton at times feel needless and add little to the storyline. It also feels TOO restrained at times and really only nods to QTs more gloriously over-dramatic style towards the last 20 minutes.\n\nWhat is done well though is Quentin's ability to lead your thought process one way and then turn it around - or drop the idea dead. There are times when you think \"yeah, this will lead to ...\" Only to have there be no lead there at all.\n\nAlso done well is the usage of an all-star cast in bit parts without the appearances feeling like little Camo performances to bring a big name to a film. Again, truly a nod to the greatness of Tarantino in that he can bring in massive names for small parts and leave the audience fulfilled.\n\nYou have to watch this if you like to watch movies by Quentin Tarantino, but equally if you're a fan of any of the lead stars too. And if you're not, it's still a good film to watch.\n\nBut if you're looking for classic Tarantino with a lot of action and a storyline that makes you think hard - you're in for a bit of a shock.",

It's literally physical comedy, loogies aside - that boy prob has a habit he doesn't need.

Next is the level of thought & creativity Tarantino put into the story line of the fictitious Western TV series \"Bounty Law\", that prefaces the decline of Rick Dalton's Hollywood career.  The movie puts enough \"hooks\" into this that I actually hope Tarantino does indulge his clearly well-thought out fantasy to make a real film or a pilot around \"Bounty Law\".  I for one would watch it!  Lastly, thanks Quentin for NOT running us through the real ending to the Sharon Tate story one more time.

Manson is described as the flipside of charismatic cult leader, a loser who shows up at the Polanski residence looking for Terry Melcher (a fact according to at least one witness) but this is all you get from this cosmic nobody.

Leo and Brad deliver some solid and hilarious performances, with a shining Margot Robbie giving a subtle and bright performance as Sharon Tate. The rest of the ensemble cast deliver some great performances in their limited screen time, with Austin Butler and Margaret Qualley delivering standout performances within the ensemble cast.

At 160+ mins it's a long trudge but the script probably only had few pages if compared with other movies of this length, why?... So many scenes are made up of shots of bods getting into cars, then long internal shot from back seat (lifted from the far better  Gun Crazy' 50s) then bods get out of car, long shots of feet walking, more bods get into cars, more long internal driving shot, bods again get out of car, more feet walking. This format is repeated from beginning to end \u2013pages of same--  The 60s heralded in a new low for movie making \u2013 features like; \u2018Beach Blanket Bingo', \u2018How to Stuff a Wild Bikini ', \u2018Sergeant Deadhead' were playing as main features across the land, el-cheapo's had become the new norm. What would usually have been a \u2018B' picture were now being sold as an \u2018A'. Yes. it may have helped a jaded Hollywood at that time but what about other mainstream audiences?\n\nSo, what might have influenced TQs fixation with this downturn in the social morays of movies? Tarantino grew up in the swinging \u201860s/mod \u201870s working in a porn cinema (this perhaps explains his addiction to perversity) including a video store - while also watching the endless re-runs of TV shows, along with an overflowing barrage of low budget, Spaghetti westerns that had flooded the market - thank goodness some audiences grew up (well, some did) and demanded better.  These endless \u2018homage's to days offering little more than cheap TV-style quickies -- now being released to the big screen --- with product that was generally catering for a guideless, acid tripping youth (such as the Manson crew, etc) wanting endless simple-minded partying. Hollywood producers loved it \u2013 now, for half the normal budgets, they were getting the same financial returns as quality features. \n\nQT has simply revived those days and a new \u2018comic book hero' generation have picked it up. Only this time round, the budgets are BIGGER while the contents remain juvenile, if not ridiculous. Trouble is, too many of today's producers and art critics also grew up in this overly comfortable, \u2018anything goes' era, so they wrap on about the glorious emptiness that's making them all rich. Some rave about the cinematography and design - with that much money being thrown about it's simple to \u2018copy' the work of previous Masters. But, no matter how expensively dressed-up and stylishly packaged rubbish maybe, it's still rubbish (but, GOOD-LOOKING rubbish). Too much you might be saying? Take a look back, revisit many of those poorly scripted, badly acted, TV shows and movies of the 50s-60s \u2013 the ones Q.T. tends to dote over...you may be surprised how your memory may have failed you as just how poor most were.  \n\nOnce U.A.T.I.H. looks like several proposed projects that never got off the ground all edited into one, and doesn't do justice to any of them. One or two characters and situations looked as if they may have been leading to something but simply fizzled out. How long might it take before more look back and ask, how were we so fooled?  Or is it just that LESS has now become the new MORE?\nSo, if this is Q.Ts 9th may there be only one left to go. Please.",

And since I believe I could've enjoyed it much more had I looked up the whole story prior, I highly recommend you do. It won't spoil the fun for you, it'll add up to it.\n\nSo I sat there, doing my best to just enjoy the movie instead of being too critical of it and looking too far into the scenes than I probably should, which certainly made for a better, more relaxed experience. The movie is long, and it being somewhat slow paced and patience demanding (which we're not always used to from Tarantino) could make it feel even longer, but if you're into that like I am, you know that's where the fun is at.\n\nI smiled effortlessly at most of the scenes (because they were just THAT good) and even laughed with some of them, but one thing is sure, in classic Tarantino fashion, the writing and dialogue were absolutely ON POINT.\n\nThe casting could not have been better, each actor portrayed their character to mere perfection and they felt more like actual people than in any other movie I've seen.\n\nThen comes the storyline, And I can't help but be a little biased here, seeing as my favorite movies are those that do nothing more than just tell you a story, the ones that make no effort to keep your attention. There's some events going on that you just have to follow, even if they feel like they're not leading to any peak or climax. This movie is a PRIME example of that. Perfect for people who like to get invested in a film rather than have it reward or gratify them.\n\nAnd then it ended, leaving me, and everyone there I'm sure, STUNNED by what we had just seen, by how brilliant it all was and wishing we could watch the whole thing over again, there and then.

Needless to say, I was oh-so-wrong. After the slow and deliberate build-up, in the last chapter of the movie you get treated to a very abrupt and jarring transition into Tarantino territory. And then when the credits roll, the next surprise to me was that the movie almost has a feel-good happy end.\n\nPerformances are top-notch, and without knowing much about the setting, the meticulous attention to detail is obvious. I enjoyed this plunge into the late sixties immensely, and the cathartic burst of violence at the end was the cherry on top.",

It's clear that Tarantino put his all into this project, and it completely shows. Career-defining stuff from Pitt and DiCaprio, who sizzle together and excel apart. Robbie doesn't have much to do of interest in comparison and her moments in the spotlight are certainly a change of pace, but still emanate the same amount of fun. The rest of the cast also shines at so many various point that they escape description. The film would have been good with these baseline ingredients, but the ending is one of my favourites from any of Tarantino's. The glorious climax of brilliant humour and over-the-top violence will remain one of the greatest cinematic moments of the 21st century, and all of the film's self-indulgences pay off.",

Brad did an excellent job complimenting him as well and their screen time together at times made the movie. Margot was a delicate flower throughout and was glad Tarantino humanized her. Unfortunately, due to the nature of her death she's viewed as a victim whereas this role gave her life. A very beautiful love letter by Quentin to the Hollywood of yesteryear.

Feel like you're in a horror movie which is weird but then you also feel like you're in a comedy then go to a drama. It's has everything feeling and has lots of fantastic scene. This movie has a ton of great actors that give a performance of a lifetime especially Brad Pitt. He's so enjoyable and also entertaining. In my opinion, he is better than Leonardo DiCaprio in this movie although Leo is in the movie more. But Brad Pitt's moments stand out more and more memorable. Margot Robbie to me felt like she having a role that is less attractive in the movie. I thought the movie would tie the three main characters together but they never did disappointing for me. (Spoiler alert!) The ending of the movie made me a little confused but Quentin Tarantino knows what he's doing and it's supposed to mean something so I'm intrigued. Overall, the movie is really good, it's fun, and there are a lot of feelings that make it perfect. This is definitely a great film and it is my second favorite Brad Pitt film of all time.",

In fact, these moments are so good that they warrant me to grant this picture a full five stars. Although there are what one might call flaws, taken altogether and tasted that away, the picture taste's like it was cooked by a master chef, no doubt about it. Movie people love the taste. They relish it. They relish this movie. \nThe weakest link in this movie is without a doubt the entire Charlie Manson storyline. Not to mention the Bruce Lee arc which is also underdeveloped...unfortunately. The lack of development in some of these key areas feels like it was due to time constraints. But that is ironic because a picture like this one should not be constrained at all. That is indeed what we have come to expect from this genre. What genre you ask? The slice of life genre, I'd reply. Where setting takes top spot in terms of the overall story. Characters interact in interesting ways within the setting. And there really isn't much of a plot, certainly not like we would get from say a thriller or something. Not to mention there's not much special effects or action. In this movie the only action is from clips that are stitched in from movies that Rick Dalton starred in. Indeed, a movie like Inglorious Basterds seems like a giant successful production from the hollywood illustrated so finely in this movie. And that is the way that Tarantino does 'meta'. Back to the problematic Charlie Manson and his  cult of interesting hippie chicks and odd dog dudes. The movie ultimately ends with a climax that stems from this underdeveloped storyline- oddly missing the man himself, whose absence is not at all explained. Perhaps I might now wonder in Tarantino's what happens to Mr. Manson? But the audience probably wont wonder this because there is no hint, not even a subtle one, to wonder so. Indeed, what we come to realize is that there is a somewhat large bite size scene or two missing from this movie.",

The dialogue is hilarious, the situations are hysterical, and the big name actors are perfect in their portrayals.  The late 60's - early 70's is trademark Tarantino in any and every film he has ever done.  Exploitation-style Film & Television everywhere.   It's clear he is in love with both the Hollywood of his youth, and the last Hollywood of fantasy the USA ever knew.  By the 1980's, we were able to \"peak behind the curtain\", and all the mystique/PR/Bullshit was gone.\n\nThe second viewing, however, opened my eyes to enough nuance that I felt outright stupid in my initial reaction.  This film is an outright tragedy.  All the characters depicted are suffering and beyond salvation.  Everyone see DiCaprio at the end of his career.  Easy.  Everybody sees Pitt as tied to DiCaprio for whatever success he EVER had, include his present as a driver and \"gopher\".  What I missed the first time is Robbie's suffering; this woman goes to a movie theater ... staffed by people who do nothing except see movies ... and struggles to get their recognition.  Almost begs them to know who she is, naming film after film, role after role, and they never really know who she is.  Even though she is in the very film they are showing RIGHT NOW, they don't really know who she is.  When the booth girl ask for a photograph, she asks her to stand next to the poster so people will know who she is.\n\nThere is a massive subtext regarding the suffering and ultimate rejection by the vert people all of entertainment (Hollywood) are inextricably drawn toward; the fans.  On some level, the 21st century exploitation filmmaker of note created a fil.m that reveals how the real people the public claims to \"love\" are ultimately betrayed and abandoned by the very people they are trying to please, trying to gratify, trying so hard to win the acceptance and love of.  Us. The cussing-shooting-did-that-just-happen sensationalistic director actually gives an unflattering mirror reflection to the audience, exactly as Rick Dalton faces himself in his trailer, but there is no redemption for us.  Nothing like he finds by recommitting his-self to the role he has been cast in.\n\nThe central protagonist (Dalton) is cast in the role of the audience; An Evil Hamlet.",

Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood is Quentin Tarantino unrestrained. There\u2019s excess all over this thing, from the unnecessarily long run-time to the constant bare feet shoved in front of the screen. This doesn\u2019t mean that he is so unhinged that the movie as a whole is a disaster. On the contrary, there are still some great elements in this film, despite its tendency to ramble on to a nearly exhausting degree. First and foremost, the acting is stellar. Brad Piitt is his usual charming self, and makes this stunt double into someone every guy would love to have as a friend. Leonardo DiCaprio is perfect as the actor struggling with the inevitable shift in his career from leading man/hero to supporting role/villain. As for how this movie handles the whole Manson family thing, I thought that was fine. It might have been more impactful to me if I was more knowledgeable about the history related to them, but I knew enough to appreciate this film and how it handled the historic tragedy. I genuinely loved the big climactic scene, and it\u2019s not just because this was the most interesting part of the film (since something of note was happening.) It has this cathartic wish-fulfillment quality that you don\u2019t see many other film-makers attempt. I only wish it felt more like the satisfying conclusion to a story, but there was so little structure to Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood. The entire thing felt like a series of small vignettes featuring a number of loosely-connected people, and then they all come together in the end for a big finish. It\u2019s one of those movies where I simply felt like things were happening rather than a story was being told, which is a pet peeve of mine. Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood is definitely lower-tier Tarantino for me, even though it will be a favorite to others.",

With a mix of pure fiction and history, Tarantino builds tension by showing you the lives of the real life stars doomed to get caught up in Manson-family murders.  Sharon Tate is portrayed in uncanny fashion by Margot Robbie, whose talent and charm is ultimately under-utilized by Tarantino's script.  The film shows a commitment to long-winded and over-indulgent sequences that serve as love-letters to late 60s LA.

Anyone who can enjoy a Clint Eastwood spaghetti western can enjoy this epic buildup to a quite memorable \"shoot out\"",

A bit overlong and once again using the distortion of actual events as he did with Inglorious Basterds, Once... has great dialogue, keeps you consistently entertained and contains a couple great performances by Leo and Brad. But certain aspects and characters feel miscast, forced and unnecessary (Zoe Bell, Lena Dunham, Mike Moh, Margot Robie's overacting). Tarantino's films speak for themselves, flawed and even after everyone else's opinion. So sit down on a weekend and just dive in.",

His signature shock-narrative style ameliorates itself in the finale, but it's hardly enough of a spectacle to warrant its 428 acclamations.",

In Hollywood is a \"what if\" historical fictional movie staring Brad a Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio who are struggling actor and stuntman in 1960's Hollywood. At the beginning of the movie we learn Leo's neighbor is Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate played by Margot Robbie. The script takes us thru Leo's life and times on sets of cowboy movies with plenty of cameos such as Steve McQueen played by Damien Lewis and Bruce Lee played by Mike Moh. It was funny to see Brad kick Lee's ass which never happened; another what if event.  Al Pacino was Leo's agent who finds him roles in Italy where Leo gets married and has four movie roles all about westerns except for one bond-like flick.  Kurt Russell played an on-set supervisor and narrator of the fictional movie.  The latter half of the flick was more entertaining where the whole storyline could have been cut shorter and get to the point faster.   The true story of Manson family murder finds pregnant Sharon Tate hung by a rope along with three other individuals but in this what-if scene finds the Manson family entering Leo's house to find drugged up Brad to face the evil doings. Brad definitely deserved the Oscar win for Best Supporting Actor role.  Overall great direction, good script, great cinematography, and great actors but it was a bit confusing, it was good to watch once.",

Man this movie is long and sometimes you can feel the movie getting a little long but when it doesn't feel long it sprints faster than you could ever imagine. Some scenes, I won't say which ones but they get brutal and kinda suspenseful and how the music sounds you feel like you're in a horror movie which is weird but then you also feel like you're in a comedy then a drama. It's has everything, lots of gore in a particularly fantastic scene that I'll never forget and this movie has a ton of great actors that give a performance of a lifetime especially Brad Pitt, he's so entertaining and in my opinion is better than Leonardo DiCaprio in this movie even though Leo is in the movie more the Brad Pitt moments stand out more and are more memorable. Margot Robbie to me felt like she was kinda useless in the movie and I thought the movie would tie the three main characters together but spoiler alert they never did which is a little disappointing and the ending too is also I little disappointing but Quentin Tarantino knows what he's doing and it's supposed to mean something so I'm intrigued. If it was any other random director I would be furious but with Tarantino it's acceptable. I can't wait to see this movie again in the future and see what Quentin Tarantino does next.",

Once upon a time in... Hollywood is the perfect mix of reality and fantasy, if this is the first Tarantino film you see you'll probably find it weird but as i said his work isn't your typical run in the mail movies. Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitts interpretations are immaculate, and the rest of the cast is great, the story itself is beautifully crafted, the constant movie and pop culture reference are exquisite",

It's not something I do very often because I choose to watch the film first and then see what others felt. But \u2018Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' certainly divided opinion among critics and audiences alike, but for me I absolutely loved this film.\n\nEssentially, there isn't much of a plot and I won't go into detail for anyone how hasn't seen it yet, but what I took away from this was that it seems to be Tarantino's film on the Film industry. To be more specific the \u2018Golden Age' of Hollywood. That is what everyone has been saying and I couldn't agree more, because throughout the 2hrs 40 minutes of this, I wasn't bored at any point. Which many found themselves like when they watched it. The 3rd act possibly drags slightly but still enough to hold my attention. Brad Pitt and Leo DiCaprio's performances as stuntman Cliff Booth and Actor Rick Dalton received the acclaim they deserved, they were both phenomenal. Pitts supporting actor Oscar win was very much deserved in my opinion after seeing this. I can't really offer more than what people have already said. Margot Robbie's performance as Sharon Tate was acceptable, in a good way. I wouldn't say the inclusion of that character made the film what I thought it was, but it was a fine role that expanded the films narrative and it became relevant to the story. \n\nFinally, something that entertained me from start to finish and it has definitely become a positive through many of Tarantino's work is the soundtracks, and wow is this particular track a memorable one. Tracks such as \u2018California Dreamin', \u2018Hush' and \u2018Brothers Love Traveling Salvation Show' were the ones that made fall in love with the film even more, and for me how good or bad the soundtrack compliments the film, ultimately can make or break how the film is received and this was a truly brilliant score.\n\nSo overall, I loved \u2018Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' because it depicts the film industry in a fine era for cinema. And Tarantino shows just how much that era meant to him too. A very different Tarantino film, he shows his versatility here in abundance and for me, I would happily watch this over and over again. \n\nQuote - Hey! You're Rick fucking Dalton. Don't you forget it.\n\n9/10",

            "content": "Finally got to watch the latest Tarantino, ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD, and I have to say that I was a bit unimpressed. While I can't deny the obvious love for film that Quentin has, and especially for that time period, which was a true shift in the industry from a more care-free style of film, to a grittier, angrier, more inventive approach brought upon by the disillusion associated with Vietnam, the hippie movement and the Manson murders. The film portrays that end of innocence pretty well by following a popular actor on the decline, Rick Dalton (played with full-blown anguish by Leonardo DiCaprio) and his long-time partner, friend and stuntman, Cliff Booth (performed with perfect tough guy cockiness by Bad Pitt), a friendship that reminds one of the rapport between Burt Reynolds and stuntman Hal Needham. Their paths crosses the grimy ones set by the Manson family and Sharon Tate.\n\nSpeaking of Tate, I can't say that I cared much for her portrayal by Margot Robbie. Through no fault of her own, but hindered by her role being badly scripted as a vacuous flower child. If the intent was to make her the symbol of the innocence that is in danger of being destroyed, it's a bit too much on the nose.\n\nWhile there is the basis of a potentially fascinating story, Tarantino wallows in a bit too much of his self-indulgence, lingering too long o certain shots, and making sure he throws our way as many movie references as he can. Don't get me wrong; I'm a sucker for movies about movies, and I could have gone for more onset Hijinks by Booth and Dalton, especially the interlude in Italy hat could have been a movie by itself.\n\nThe Manson family moments could have brought a certain amount of tension to the film, but the whole flippancy expressed through every frame by Tarantino sabotages the stress we could have felt in those scenes.\n\nHe also goes back to his statement that a story beats History, and that the world is saved by art, by rewriting History like he did in INGLORIOUS BASTERDS and DJANGO UNCHAINED. While it was refreshing and unexpected in BASTERDS, it has lost a bit of its impact by now.\n\nI know that I am going against the grain of many reviewers who are claiming it's a marvelous film, and I'll admit that I did fall in love with Brad Pitt's character enough that I would love to see other stories about him.\n\nI feel this one wasn't the best one to tell.",

Having to rely on narration to get the moviegoer to understand what is going on is not the type of movie he makes, but he couldn't get away from it.  In my opinion some of the best parts of his films are dialogs, intertwining story lines and bringing focus to the characters.  This film had none of that.  We are dragged through bits and pieces of forced character development, fragmented story lines, and a whole lot of going nowhere.  I'm sorry but if this film was made by an unknown filmmaker, I don't think anyone would be giving it good reviews (not even \"OK\" reviews).  Honestly this is like getting a really bad plate of food from a world famous chef, and reviewing that it was great based solely on the fact that it should have been great because of who made it.

            "content": "Visually, this is Quentin Tarantino at his most vibrant, most detailed, and his most stylish. The director does a brilliant job of recreating the 1960s pop culture iconography. His wide shots of busy main streets are visually stunning in the detail from billboards and movie posters, as vintage cars drive down the strip drenched in fluorescent neon lights against the dusk sky. Whereas vintage radio commercials for Heaven Sent perfume play in the background amongst the soundtrack ladled with supersonic sounds of the 60s. The director captures the period's sights and sounds so vividly, that the 60s Los Angeles backdrop feels incredibly lived in.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio (The Beach) delivers a fantastic performance as Rick Dalton, an insecure star who is on the decline. However, the feature belongs to Brad Pitt (12 Monkeys). As Cliff Booth, he's charming and incredibly fun to watch. Pitt brings a certain energy to each scene that keeps your eyes glued to the screen, waiting for his next move. Especially during the incredibly tense scene at Spahn Ranch. Margot Robbie (Harley Quinn: Birds Of Prey) is almost magical playing the actress Sharon Tate. Many critics bemoaned Robbie's dialogue-light portrayal of Tate. However, one could argue Once Upon A Time In Hollywood captures Tate's wholesomeness. Instead of being associated with death and macabre, Tate's life should be celebrated for the beautiful soul she was.\n\nUpon release Once Upon A Time In Hollywood was billed as Tarantino's tale about the harrowing Manson-family murders. A home invasion nightmare that brought an end to the \"Summer of Love\" on August 9th 1969. Knowing this, there's a state of tension that lingers throughout. However, like Inglorious Basterds (2009), the historical record is used as a mere springboard for the directors fevered Imagineering. Tarantino takes the same route here inverting history, with Rick and Cliff turning the tables on the Manson family killers. The prolonged \"What if?\" violent finale is brutal and unapologetically satisfying. \n\nOverall, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood is a solid addition to Quentin Tarantino's filmography and serves as an ode to the golden age of Hollywood. The combination of fictional characters and real-life figures weave a revisionist tale around the event that arguably signalled the end of the \"Summer of Love\". It's more tender than the director's previous entry The Hateful Eight (2015), but still possesses most of the director's trademark shocking touches.",

            "content": "Another one of Tarantino's overhyped and alternative reality movies that really has little to say about today's times. In this film, Tarantino wraps himself in the allure of 1969 Los Angeles pretending that he has something to say about aging actors or random cult violence. But he really doesn't. If you break down the movie - the Tate story is only there to provide a 3rd act climax where villains that can be shot, mauled, bashed and burned alive. Otherwise, it really serves no purpose other than adding atmosphere and context to a somewhat drab main plot. The Rick Dalton main plot is just another rehash of stories we've seen before about a bad aging actor who's being pushed out of the business. Yeah it's Leo and Brad Pitt. So what? As Shania would say, \"that don't impress me much.\"\nAs always, it's interesting to see how Tarantino breaks convention - like having a flashback inside a flashback - but if you're not a film nerd, this film may not be to your liking.  Overall, it's somewhat entertaining. But not the masterpiece that the lemming critics would have you believe. If you got nothing better to do for 3 hours, then go for it. But if you want and insightful look at the past and stardom, I highly recommend Almost Famous.",

            "content": "Quentin Tarantino likes happy endings. He likes them so much, in his imagination, he goes back in time and preemptively obliterates people responsible for history's nightmares, like the Holocaust, and the Manson Family murders which, for Quentin at least, did irreparable harm to the innocent chilled-out mood of Hollywood in 1969. \n\nIn Tarantino's repaired world (called \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\") Clint Eastwood (or someone much like him) never became a bitter old curmudgeon arguing with a chair. Instead, he got cast in Roman Polanski movies mid-career and got to go to more parties and keep his chauffeur and personal stunt double. And the cool mood in Hollywood never got overrun by dirty hippies with no cars and their awful political correctness. \n\nOh, people still get murdered in Quintin's world, but this time it's the right people: the political people, the radicals, the Nazis and people who will become Nazis, the people who will start killing if they haven't already. And this time the good guys win with every imaginable act of violence. The dirty hippies get mauled by dogs, smashed to a bloody pulp and charred by flames - just the sort of happy ending to make us all laugh and cheer. \n\nWhen I saw \"Inglourious Basterds\" I was struck by the irony of a scene within a scene: me sitting in a theater of people laughing at a revenge fantasy where Hitler is burned up with a bunch of Nazis as they sit in a theater laughing at a violent propaganda film about a German sniper endlessly shooting Allied soldiers from a clock tower until dead bodies are piled up. As flames envelope the screen I thought to myself \"this is moral hell and Tarantino is holding up a mirror and showing his audience how they are like the Nazis delighting in righteous violence on the movie screen.\"\n\nAt the time I thought that this irony was intentional and Tarantino's \"Basterds\" movie was a clever morality play about the dangers of \"preemptive war.\" I'm not so sure now. Perhaps Tarantino likes the idea of killing the bad people before they get a chance to kill us. And maybe he knows who should be allowed to pick the bad people: filmmakers (the old fashioned Hollywood kind), and actors who are childlike and innocent, and their no-foolishness stunt doubles who don't care about politics or activism. Or maybe the audience should decide what's fair in Movies and War. \n\nThe only characters in \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" (set in 1969) who say anything about the Vietnam War or inequality or politics are the criminally insane Charles Manson family members. Everybody else could care less about poverty or inequality - as they float in their pools and dance at the Playboy mansion - because they are the beautiful and harmless people who create the escapism of movies! Tarantino seems to be saying that Hollywood got ruined by politics and undue attention to the private lives of its creative flower children.\n\nIt's hard not to see \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" as a subtle jab at the Me Too movement. Brad Pitt plays a likable guy who, it is said, \"killed his wife and got away with it.\" But when an underage girl tries to seduce him he dutifully turns her down. Evidently Hollywood has a young girl problem. Roman Polanski is glamorized as the jet setting genius who made \"Rosemary's Baby.\" Al Pacino plays a movie producer and kindly old-world father figure named Marvin Schwarzs (in contrast to Harvey Weinstein who produced most of Tarantino's movies). Sharon Tate, played by Margot Robbie, is the only sweet and likable woman in the movie. She's almost angelic. All the others are either nagging wives, Feminazis or underage jail-bate. The near exception is one 8 year old actress (she prefers to be called an \"actor\"). Yet even she takes issue when Leo Dicaprio's character calls her \"pumpkin puss.\"\n\nFor all it's mystifying detail, \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" is still a feast for the senses and a charming piece of nostalgia. Watching DiCaprio's insecure TV star character, Rick Dalton, melt down alone in his trailer after botching a scene is priceless. It may be Tarantino's most self-assured and well crafted movie to date. The violent finale plays like Three Stooges slapstick, and again, I found myself laughing at a woman getting her head smashed in, and another woman being burned up by a tool-shed flame thrower (left over from a previous movie). Remember, in the context of this movie, the Manson Family hasn't killed anyone, yet somehow Hollywood's grooviest times were rescued by the opportune violent killing of some hippies in place of Sharon Tate.\n\nOne has to wonder does Quentin Tarantino want us to reflect on these details or to just lighten up and laugh them off? I can't tell.",

It is the same reason movies set in LA often get a few noms or wins during Oscar season that many would call questionable. This is not to detract from Tarantino's talent. The man is a great writer, though as of late he has become a blowhard. Scripts are long and drawn out, and then they all crash into an ending that seems tacked on rather than built to which begs the question does he even know where he is going with his films anymore. It is not visionary, it is repetitive and showing very little sign of growth. He is a craftsman who carves an excellent movie each time, but they are more or less the same.\n\nDE: Tarantino runs a decent ship, and Hollywood is no different. Everything seems to be on point. Every department is hitting its marks, and we are building a tale in his distinct (if that is the right word) style. In terms of editing, the loss of Sally Menke can be felt in every one of his films since she passed. She somehow was able to contain him and give a better structure. Though from seeing her works outside of the Tarantino verse, you can see he had an equal part in elevating her. Together they were able to take his longwinded approach and make it come off with a steady pace and allow decent investment from the audience, but now however that is slipping away at a fast pace with each subsequent film.\n\nW: Tarantino is one of the great writers, he is not on Miyazaki's or Anderson's level, but he is undoubtedly on the same level as the Coen brothers or Bong Joon-ho. Which is not a level to sniff at, but the problem with Tarantino's writing is that he may have switched genres, but he has not adapted to it. More that he has made another Tarantino movie with a new shell on it. Which is great, but if I wanted to see the same thing as before I might as well watch the classics. It is sort of like a band doing a new tour 20 years later trying to flog the new stuff that sounds far too similar to the old stuff, and the fans would much rather prefer to hear the hits.\n\nC: Have you seen a Tarantino, Scorsese or Oliver Stone movie? Then guess what you have seen Robert Richardson's work and along with it some iconic shots that have littered avatars and uni students bedrooms for decades. His outing this time is impressive, though it might not match a level that he created. That said the lens seems to tell more of a story here than Tarantino's writing, which tells you everything you need to know.\n\nA: Acting is stereotypically cartoonish, but that has become a standard for Tarantino. Though Pitt's depiction of the more sane character throughout this 2D world of actors stands out. Sadly given the cast, we are working with, and the sheer level of talent coupled with the extent in which we examine these characters lives it feels underwhelming, and each one is more an allegory than a persona in their own right.\n\nS: As strange as it seems the sound department is usually one of the reasons I watch a Tarantino film. Since Inglourious Basterds someone in the sound department is getting an Oscar nom, whether it is music, mixing or editing. Without fail Hollywood continues this trend. Just excellent.\n\nPD: This film is not pretending to be the 1960s, it is the 1960s. I know you have seen many a period piece, and they all do a decent job, but it is the subtle nuances and the dirt that make the difference. This is not a glossy veneer trying to rewrite a section of history, this is just trying to capture an era for better or worse. This may be down to the fact that Tarantino is obsessed with the period and only a slight glance at his oeuvre would back this notion up.\n\nBA: The costume design, while simple is also great, it catches the style of the era without feeling like it is overexaggerating the form or the zeitgeist of the time. The visual effects in the latter portion of the film while jarring are quite well done and stand out.\n\nEVO: It is not one of Tarantino's \"funner\" films, which is odd given that it is a bright nostalgia backed film told from the perspective of mostly positive souls. If you are a Tarantino completest, you are going to want to see it, but for many, the question of why did I sit through that for 3 hours will ring true on the lips, and while the film is crafted brilliantly I cannot help but finding myself siding with them.",

He never fails to bring in a lot of pop culture references along with long dialogue sequences, which brings me to my next comment.

None of the characters were memorable, rather washouts and full of self doubt. The biggest proof that this was a weak installment is the fact that not a single meme has entered popular culture from this film, unlike Tarantino's other works.

Every scene is basically a vignette short story that could stand on its own, and if there is any flaw in the movie, that's probably it. It's less about plot, and more about interesting and likable characters put in situations that range from mundane to utterly ridiculous. It's possible that the average movie goer will overlook  some of the little bits of ubiquitous humor and nostalgia, and if so, the movie could feel slow, and perhaps even boring.

Once again, he has made an enjoyable, overlong and seemingly pointless re-imagining (think Inglorious Bastards, Hateful 8, etc) that pervades his private fantasies, instead of an original narrative.\n\nOf course, 1969 featured Woodstock and Altamont, but the Manson killings was the quintessential, bleak end of that exciting decade. And here, Tarantino imagines a clear clash between early 1960's macho culture confronting a debased late 1960's hippie disaster, with the macho culture coming out on top. With both Pitt and DiCaprio on top form as a tough stunt man (think Clint Eastwood) and fading, insecure Western star (no obvious parallel I know of), most of the film seems to be wallowing in their relationship. But the real story is the scheduled murder of next store neighbour Sharon Tate by the Manson crazies in August. We are waiting for it - how will Tarantino deal with it? It will be gruesome that's for sure. But what do these macho neighbours have to do with it?\n\nWell, that's the real tale. What if the Manson family made a slightly different turn and missed Terry Melcher's old house and invaded Leo and Brad's pad? Quite a different outcome from the real story. The blood bath was on the other foot, with the macho boys dispensing ruthless frontier justice on the home invaders.\n\nDespite the length, I found it captivating, weird, beautiful and disgusting all at the same time. The message was clear - if drug crazed hippies are out to kill you, a couple of tough guys with a pit bull and a flame thrower will save you from a fate worse than Covid-19.\n\nNot a perfect film, but a wildly enjoyable romp.",

It's not inaccessible to people who didn't live through the '60's as written in some media reviews, because if that were true, all of the films I've watched & enjoyed that were set in the Stone Age (Quest For Fire), the Roman Empire (I Claudius), the Middle Ages (Marketa Lazarova) the 16th, 17th, 18th (Jane Austin's \"Emma\" or \"Pride and Prejudice\") 19th (\"Wuthering Heights\") centuries & the complete 20th century (everything), wouldn't have been relatable to or understood by me. I wasn't bored by THOSE films because I'm a reader. I had a good public education. I strived for the best grades I could get in K through 12, I didn't drop out or ignore my teachers during class and I did my homework. I went to college by working from age 14, saved every penny, got huge loans that took me 30 years to pay off, & I received a good education that required me to read, read, read, & learn from my instructors & professors how to interpret those books, whether text books or novels or non-fiction writings. It expanded my brain so that I am able to do the same thing with movies, so I'm not bored by them. I can enjoy movies that are really well crafted like this one. This film is the work of an evolving director, who didn't \"make up a stupid boring long thing with too much talking about something that didn't even happen that way\" (I'm not quoting anyone. I'm combining all of the negatives I've read/heard everywhere into one paraphrase). He gave us a \"what if\", & nice \"if only\". It's not boring. Tons of funny things happen in short bursts throughout the film & are cleverly brought back together in that final blast that is the ultimate Tarantinoed \"what if\" that pays homage to Sharon Tate & the others who were tortured & killed by the Manson Family. It might disappoint a Tarantino fan who has not yet matured at the same rate. It might be better later, with more accrued observation/thinking skills.",

I tried watching this film five times and always turned it off. I finally got through it, even fast forwarding thru sections of the film, to finally finish it was pretty unbearable. Tarantino's worst film to date! My first thoughts after finishing the film were ''what a piece of shit''. I habe never said this about any of his films and it is a shame. This unimaginative version of real life events skewed to Tarantino's will, was boring, overly long (by about an hour) and just muddled story of a falling Hollywood star and his decent from stardom leave much to be desired. This may have been a decent film on it's own prwemise but the added mix of the Tate/Manson murders just doesn't work. Expected better from a giant. The only decent parts of the movie are Brad Pitt and sadly, the best part of the film was the dog.",

I want to respect these truly amazing actors/director/artists by telling my honest critical opinions.  I know the Charles Manson family story; ***SPOILER ALERT*** Like Inglourious Basterds, I LOVE how the ending was changed for the better... however the Sadie character - I think it was - would Never flail like that and for so long WHILE holding a gun after merely being struck in the face by a can of dogfood (though I effing loved that part hahah - my man Brad Pitt!).
