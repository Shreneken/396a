I think this and the paradigm shift it has inspired in my life and the seven miles I ran this morning - make it the most important film I've seen in a long time. POWER UP!",

His work and focus on plants being essential for optimal performance and enhanced body capabilities is a game changer in it self. There's no vegan stigma attached. Just straight science. He is incredible at highlighting that men don't need to eat meat to be manly in fact that stigma is long gone and dead. Unless you live in a cave still. But the work provided and athletes showcased. Arnold you're the man. Plant strong. All day long!!!!",

            "content": "Terrible. The biggest star of this movie built his physique and career on high quality protein like steak and eggs and now implies people can perform on plant food. Sorry, we are not gorillas, our digestive system is completely different. The ideas espoused in this doc are a threat to the health of the individual. Any diet that needs to be supplemented with truck loads of artificially prepared vitamins and minerals is not healthy, nor cost effective. But try following a vegan diet if you doubt what I am saying. You may feel good initially but are likely to become fatigued, have poor exercise recovery, fart a lot, and be running to the loo much more regularly. But hey - Gorillas fart a lot too! And they're strong. If you are a Gorilla this diet is for you. If an actual human - your intelligence  should leave you offended by the crap proposed here.",
