    "summary": "The affable Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power) is being tried for the murder of a wealthy woman, and legendary lawyer Sir Wilfrid Robarts (Charles Laughton) has chosen to represent him. Unfortunately, Leonard's alibi depends on the testimony of his callous wife, Christine (Marlene Dietrich) -- who, after the discovery of a legal loophole, makes the shocking decision to appear in court against him. To Sir Wilfrid's surprise, this is only the first in a series of puzzling revelations and reversals.",

The essence of this play is total misdirection: to have the defendant and chief witnesses appear to be exactly the opposite of who they really are. Also, important circumstantial evidence is totally inconsistent with guilt. For example, the window broken from the outside. The defendant wouldn't have broken the window from the outside because he was a friend of the murdered woman. The woman's assistant was not a credible witness because she was hard-of-hearing and had a financial motive to lie. The letters were not credible because they would have been mailed to Germany, And, the trial itself was preposterous.  Lawyers are not allowed to yell at and argue with witnesses like that.",

            "content": "A fun and creative Agatha Christie whodunnit with the added twists of the procedural investigation being conducted in a courtroon rather than with the estimable Hercule Poirot in some exotic locale. In his place we have Charles Laughton, who tosses every trope you might think of for a stuffy English barrister - fussy, detail-obsessed, clever, fastidious, intolerable, and brimming with dry humor - a brings them to life in Sir Wilfrid Robarts. Pitted against him is the mysterious Christine Vole, played with equal capability by the great Marlene Dietrich, whose motives and role in the murder remain fluid and undecided until the film's final moments. \n\nPerhaps I let this particular film hang around a bit too long in the list of world classics of cinema; I walked away having expected slightly more than what I got. The performances were very nice (particularly Dietrich's puzzling persona and Laughton's charming curmudgeon), but the plot itself swings around in fits and starts, with a humorous introduction to Sir Wilfrid's character followed by protracted periods of flashbacks that serves mostly as context for the more engaging courtroon scenes and the final twist reveal. Still, it all comes together as material to flesh out each of the individual characters and provide more of a justification for the dueling of personalities rather than dry fact, and makes for a very entertaining film regardless. \n\nIt is always great to see Laughton bicker with his real-life wife, Elsa Lanchester, in some of their shared films; their chemistry is undeniable and translates so well to the screen. (3.5/5)",

Twists, turns and more than a helping of humor, supplied mostly by the comically contentious relationship between Laughton and his supremely annoying nurse, Elsa Lancaster (Laughton's real-life wife).

            "content": "Can the law bend in the courtroom?\n\nBilly Wilder's courtroom drama mystery Witness for the Prosecution (1957) asks us how a jury, witnesses, lawyers, and laws can be manipulated in a court of law. I find Wilder's direction riveting with astonishing confidence in establishing all of writer Agatha Christie's intricate legal details and mystery clues for the audience to unfold. Christie's writing ruminates on the role of witnesses in a trial and how someone can interpret testimony. Wilder's focused direction hones in on each detail to hint to the viewer as to what is really going on throughout Witness for the Prosecution, while also getting laughs from Wilder's playful sense of humor.\n\nMarlene Dietrich steals the show with a powerful femme fatale role as Christine Vole, who curiously chooses to swear under oath as a witness for the prosecution against her own husband. She is fascinating with every sly glance and revealing word. Marlene is always drop dead gorgeous, effortlessly enthralling, and dramatically flirty. She commands the silver screen with her awesome star power, heavy gravitas, and captivating dramatic performance. Tyrone Power is excellent as Marlene Dietrich's husband, the defendant Leonard Vole, who is desperately pleading with jurors to accept his innocence.\n\nCharles Laughton is delightful as the stuffy and fastidious barrister Sir Wilfrid Robarts. He's a by the book defense lawyer with extreme precision and intuition. Laughton's funny, booming voiced lawyer Robarts is a pleasure to watch, especially alongside his real life wife Elsa Lanchester as the meticulous and stubborn Nurse Plimsoll. They have wonderful chemistry on screen together with hilarious comedic timing. \n\nJohn Williams is steadfast as the other lawyer Brogan-Moore, while Henry Daniell has an interesting presence as the solicitor Mayhew. Ian Wolfe's dedicated butler Carter is funny next to Laughton's brilliant lawyer trying to sneak cigars, booze, and additional legal counsel. I liked the friendly and inviting Norma Varden as the wealthy widow Miss Emily Jane French. Irish actress Una O'Connor is a riot as the mean and accusatory maid Janet McKenzie. Ruta Lee even cameos as Diana in the crowd witnessing the trial.\n\nIn my opinion, if 12 Angry Men is the best film about jury deliberation, The Verdict is the best film about lawyers, Legally Blonde is the best film about cross-examining witnesses, To Kill a Mockingbird is the best film about why a lawyer should represent a defendant, Judgement at Nuremberg is the best film about judges, then Witness for the Prosecution is the best film about witnesses. I think that I was questioning every suspect, motive, and opportunity all the time while enjoying Witness for the Prosecution. I was enthralled by every minute of Wilder's twisting legal picture with Agatha Christie's startling story. Witness for the Prosecution is a must see classic that redefines how you look at courtroom dramas and legal proceedings.\n\nDaniel Mandell's editing keeps 116 minutes feeling like 30 with sharp cuts and no unnecessary scenes. Russell Harlan's cinematography has lovely wide shots, but it is his stunning close-ups that reveal whether a character is telling the truth. Alexandre Trauner's art direction is breathtaking with a stark contrast in court between nervous witnesses and calm lawyers to the more rigid English society appearances outside the courtroom. Howard Bristol's set decoration ensures every courtroom and law office looks finely furnished and proper.\n\nMatty Malneck's score has an air of mysterious atmosphere and intense romanticism. He composes an intense accompaniment to this legal thriller. Edith Head's fashionable suits for Marlene Dietrich are to die for honestly. Wally Westmore's make-up artistry crafts Marlene's face into film perfection.\n\nTo summarize, Witness for the Prosecution gets at the heart of why people testify and what laws can do in the right and wrong hands.",

            "content": "I had always known that Marlene Dietrich was a great movie star as she has a striking face, lilting German accent and a certain je ne sais quoi that few other performers could touch. She had never stood out as a brilliant actress to me however as her work in Morocco (1930) and The Garden of Allah (1936) largely rely on her glamorous screen persona and do not give her the opportunity to extend herself. It was a shock then to see her give a delightfully frothy comedic performance in a Billy Wilder film as she utilizes her sex appeal and ability for slapstick comedy to great effect. She is the primary selling point of the film as while Elsa Lanchester and Charles Laughton are entertaining enough you can't help but miss her when she is not on screen.\n\nInventor Leonard Vole, Tyrone Power, is suspected of murdering the elderly Mrs. Emily French, Norma Varden, to gain access to the money she had left him in her will. Vole hires famed barrister Sir Wilfrid Robards, Charles Laughton, to defend him but Robards is facing significant health problems and is under the watchful eye of his nurse Miss Plimsoll, Elsa Lanchester, who annoys him greatly. Robards defends his client, believing he is guilty, but their case is complicated by the fact that Vole's German wife Christine, Marlene Dietrich, serves as a witness for the prosecution as she claims that she and Vole are not officially married as she is actually married to a German man and accuses her husband of being guilty. Robards wins the case because he is able to find evidence that suggests that Christine was lying. Revelations about the source of his information leave him confounded and his loyalties must shift.\n\nFew directors have as light a touch as Wilder as he produces possibly the best film adaptation of an Agatha Christie novel by leaning into the comedic aspects of her stories and playing to the talents of his cast. He is able to propel the film along at a relatively quick pace making us more invested in the characters than in the courtroom drama. He gives Laughton, Lanchester and especially Dietrich room to play and there is that occasional touch of melancholy that he would put to such good use in The Apartment (1960). He doesn't get lost in unnecessary details surrounding the mystery as some directors would have and gives the film an episodic structure that is somewhat necessary with a film like this. He was deserving of his Best Director nomination as while few would count this among his strongest work he pulls together a story that could have fallen into disarray in the hands of a lesser director such as Kenneth Branagh.\n\nThe performances are really what needs to be discussed because as much as Wilder's sure hand is indispensable he needs the work of a talent like Laughton to make the film shine. He has bluster and more than enough gravitas to make us slightly afraid when he takes against those around him but he is also playful and charming in his own way. He finds particular inspiration in scenes when he is asked to engage in verbal sparring with Lanchester as his put downs of her and prissiness in response to her properness elicits laughter. Much must also be said of Lanchester who is delightfully buttoned up in a role that gives her some great dialogue to work with and allows her to put her guileless expressions to good use. Power makes an interesting murder suspect as he is effectively mercurial, likable at one moment and sinister at the next, with his use as a supporting actor being better than his efforts as a leading man in The Mask of Zorro (1940). Even Ruta Lee, who only has about five minutes of screen time, is deliciously nasty and rude in the way that only villains in Wilder movies can be as she has touches of Fred MacMurray as Jeff D. Sheldrake.\n\nTo a modern audience this may seem like a strange choice for a Best Picture nomination but in comparison to the more traditionally prestigious Sayonara (1957) and Peyton Place (1957) this is a masterpiece.",

            "content": "The most impressive thing about Witness for the Prosecution is that it's a classic film from 60 years ago and yet it kept me guessing from beginning to end. I was constantly wondering what would happen, and how they could win this case. Even up to the final frames of film it shocked me, and that's hard to do now that I've become a more experienced (and jaded) movie fan.\n\nCharles Laughton is superb as the grumpy old barrister whose mind hasn't slowed down one bit no matter what condition his body might be in. I loved the comic relief the movie offered through his relationship with his nurse, played by Elsa Lanchester. Their interplay in the opening scenes was hilarious and it kept giving me something to smile about during the trial. \n\nTyrone Power turned on the charm and you instantly take his side in the film. He also turns up the drama for some of the difficult courtroom scenes. Marlene Dietrich was the wild card. In many scenes I wasn't enjoying her presence, in fact I was starting to think I completely hated her performance. Without spoiling anything, let's just say she reveals something that justifies all that came before. \n\nThere are moments in Witness for the Prosecution that I didn't enjoy, but they were few and far between. Despite any nitpicks I have, it's still an amazing film in a genre I adore. I want to own it at some point so I can freely watch it again and again. In fact there are a bunch of scenes that would take on new meaning knowing how it all concludes. It's a stellar movie that impressed me a lot.",

Wilder really understands how to tell a dramatic story that keeps the story moving along, while we learn so much about the characters throughout. The character development is so strong that you can't help but care about what happens.\n\nThe highlight of the film though is most notably shown in the courtroom. Wilder allows his actors to have the time to chew the scenery in the best kinds of ways. All of the cast give themselves fully to the characters and to the script, and so every moment is dripping with drama and tension. The standout moments in the film must be given to Marlene Dietrich who out performs every actor in the film. Everyone is on top of their game, but Dietrich puts them all to shame.\n\nThe twists keep coming, and you can see the effect of them on every courtroom drama/thriller for years to come.

It was a splendid idea to have the film's protagonist to come off at first as unpleasant, in order to have its third act feel all the more powerful, and also it strays away from the typical leading men in films similar to this.

Less is certainly sometimes more, Witness for the Prosecution's approachable story and entertaining characters is enough to keep its audience interested, there was no need for Wilder to add flair to the film's camerawork as that would have probably given the film too much ambiguity, as to enjoy this film one must take in the information straight; don't over think, just let it flow through you.

You hang on every word, especially as Charles Laughton's performance, as the defense barrister Sir Wilfred Robards, is so superb.\n\nBut wait that's not all...(saying anything more would give away too much).\n\nAs mentioned, Charles Laughton's performance is brilliant.  He captures the spirit of curmudgeonly and sharp-tongued yet humorous Sir Wilfred Robards perfectly.  Good support from Marlene Dietrich and Elsa Lanchester.\n\nOnly negative aspect to the entire movie is the performance of Tyrone Power.  He is badly miscast, especially as he is an American playing a English character.  He doesn't even try to disguise his accent.  Plus his acting was way over-the-top.  Far too theatrical.",

You see, this is one of those famous films that you are not supposed to talk about - but, you see, I'd forgotten that and probably you should too.  Charles Laughton is a famous barrister who has just suffered a heart attack but is lured back to the courtroom to defend Tyrone Power (in his last film role) who is accused of murder and confronting a damning amount of circumstantial evidence.  Marlene Dietrich plays his wife - the witness for the prosecution - who throws a monkey-wrench into the defense.  Laughton, Power, and Dietrich play to their strengths and the result is nothing less than gripping.  Even if you may have seen it before.",

I decided to see if I could find it on Amazon Prime and sure enough it was there. It's based off an Agatha Christie play, which in turn is based off a short story she wrote. This movie and the short story are some of my favorite works of Dame Christie. I wanted to watch it again to see if it held up to my memory. In short, it very much does.\n\nThis was released in 1957 and is in that glorious black and white. I know some people might have issues with older movies like this but I hope they won't let that get in the way of watching this movie. It feels very much like watching a play, rather than the modern action thriller. There really isn't much in the way of cinematography or sharp camera angles, rather just a straight on viewing of the actors acting. This is where the movie shines, the actors made me feel and believe in their stories. I managed to get a feel for the depth of their history from just a few brief snatches of dialogues. This brings us to the writing. The characters and the plot move at an excellent pace, building suspense and intrigue. I couldn't help but stay focused watching the movie play out, even though I had seen it previously and remembered how it ended.\n\nI'll keep my review on this short for if I keep talking about it, I will end up speaking to parts of the movie I shouldn't. If you enjoy a good suspense tied with legal drama and a dash of mystery then you'll want to see this.\n\nVerdict: Recommended",

            "content": "In writer-director Billy Wilder's 1957 courtroom drama Witness for the Prosecution, we follow an elderly lawyer (Charles Laughton) with poor health who takes on a criminal case, much to the dissatisfaction of his private nurse (Elsa Lanchester). This case requires him to defend a man (Tyrone Power) who is accused of killing an old, rich lady (Norma Varden) whom he had developed a fond friendship with. He's accused of the crime because she made him the main acceptor of her will. \n\nThis case becomes more complicated when the defendant's German wife (Marlene Dietrich) basically testifies against her husband because she's actually married to another man. The lawyer finds this particular part of the case strange because wives should naturally be supportive of their husbands no matter what. From there, many more complicated issues take place with attempting to solve this case that it all leads up to a shocking finale. \n\nThis finale was so famous that the filmmakers literally put up a disclaimer at the very end of the film telling its audiences not to talk about it or give away the film's secret. You don't see that type of disclaimer nowadays anymore, do you? While I can't say that this is one of the most shocking endings ever, I will say that I do appreciate the filmmaker's attempt to keep the ending a secret as much as possible. That's more than I can say for all the movie trailers and commercials today which seem to give away too much about certain movies, though that's another subject I'll plan to tackle another time via editorial. \n\nOne of the aspects about Witness for the Prosecution overall that I liked was the relationship between the lawyer and the nurse. I just like how this lawyer sort of does whatever he can to disobey his nurse's advice and how much this nurse unintentionally drives him nuts. I thought they handled that relationship very well. Neither of them came off as bad simply because they disagreed with each other, they just constantly got in each other's way so to speak. \n\nAs far as courtroom dramas go, I don't think that Witness for the Prosecution is the strongest film I've seen from this genre, but I still think that this is a pretty good picture in its own right. The storytelling is pretty well focused and the acting by the likes of Laughton and Lanchester are well done. However, I'm split in regards to what I feel about the main case itself. Sometimes I was really interested in the developments that arose in the case. Other times, I wasn't either due to being unable to understand certain parts or just finding the characters involved in the case not that interesting. \n\nThis doesn't put the film to a complete halt by any means, it just makes the better parts of the picture stand out more. As a whole, Witness for the Prosecution does what it was intended to do. If you like courtroom dramas in general, this film does the intended purposes a film in this genre are supposed to do and if you'll settle for that, then you won't be let down by any means.",

Laughton is an English defense attorney just recovering from a heart attack. However, soon he gets so intrigued by Power's case that he agrees to defend him. Power's character Vole seems to be falsely accused for the murder of a widowed woman he hardly knew. He does have an alibi in his wife (Dietrich) but she seems to refute Vole's words and the case takes a bad turn. Through a flashback we see into their complicated past. The befuddled Laughton finally catches a break and is able to prove Dietrich is lying. He has been victorious in defending Vole but then the plot takes a cruel twist. What was reality before now seems to be completely false. Adapted from a story by Agatha Christie, this film has good characters and a brilliant climax.",

            "content": "This movie is as good as you would expect a Billy Wilder adaptation of an Agatha Christie play to be. If you know who both of those people are, I don't really have to say much more, do I?\n\nThe story follows a man (Tyrone Power) who has been accused of murdering a rich old widow, his ambiguous and icy wife (Marlene Dietrich), and the overweight, irascible, clever old lawyer (Charles Laughton) who decides to get to the bottom of the case. The movie is so full of twists and turns that it actually ends with a literal request for you not to spoil it for audiences who haven't seen it yet, so even though the film is 55 years old, I'll still preserve its secrets for you.\n\nCharles Laughton, who got an Oscar nomination for the movie, is hilarious and very memorable as the old lawyer. It's a very colorful character, the sort of grumpy but brilliant old man that seems to have been more common in old movies and that you rarely see in movies these days. Marlene Dietrich is also really great as the accused's wife, who takes some shocking actions throughout the course of the movie. Her performance is played very close to the chest, revealing little behind her cold exterior. Tyrone Power is fine as the accused, though he mostly just has to sit there and look worried about coniction. Elsa Lanchester, who also got an Oscar nomination for her comparatively small part, is very funny as the lawyer's fussy nurse.\n\nThe screenplay was technically written by Wilder and Harry Kurnitz, but obviously the cleverness of the story and the witty dialogue are due to Agatha Christie. I always mean to see and read more of her stuff than I have been able to so far, but I've never yet been disappointed by a Christie story. Billy Wilder's directorial style is maybe more conservative and traditional than usual, but it seems appropriate to the material's stage origins. This movie would probably end up being classified as minor Billy Wilder, but that's still a compliment when his major work includes Double Indemnity, Some Like It Hot, and Sunset Boulevard.",

A more glamorous pair, Tyrone Power and Marlene Dietrich, both is their latter days (for Dietrich, it stands for her acting career, however for Mr. Power, tragically, it showcases his last flair on screen, he would die one year after in a heart attack during shooting SOLOMON AND SHEBA 1959). \n\nThanks to the magic of B&W texture, it is so shocking to know Ms. Dietrich was in her 50s while shooting this film, I hate to admit this is only her second film I\u00e2(TM)ve watched after STAGE FRIGHT (1950, a 7/10), her queenly demeanor dominates each frame she is in with an one-of-a-kind vibe which could easily conquer each and every audience. And Mr. Power, rarely being hailed or honored for his acting capacity other than his gorgeous mien, finally leaves a memorable performance to end his untimely life. \n\nThe only hiccup of the film, for me at least, is the ending, which seems too rash to culminate in the climax, Wilder is not rational enough to throw the curtain call in such a rush, nevertheless it is riveting still. \n\nThe film secured 6 Oscar nominations without winning (including BEST PICTURE, BEST DIRECTOR, BEST ACTOR and BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS), gratifyingly, it lost to THE BRIFGE ON THE RIVER KWAI (1957), which reminds me there is another candidate on my must-see list and with fellow nominees like 12 ANGRY MEN (1957, 9/10), one have to admit, 1957 is a vintage year for Hollywood film industry!",

His scenes as he grapples with the unfolding plot, doing his best to figure out the truth as well as win his case are pure entertainment.

The twist ending was actually one of the worst done and worst written twist endings I have ever seen. Twists done correctly are brilliant and somewhat chilling, and in my opinion that almost always comes from a combination of relevance to something earlier in the plot and/or an explanation of something in the way you would least expect. And of course it has to be interesting and surprising. This film just explains the last ten minutes or so, regardless of the rest of the movie, and springs a bunch of surprises without any relevance to anything else ever established in the plot. Like screaming \"John McClane cheated once in high school!\" at the end of Die Hard. It has nothing whatsoever to do with the plot or the film, and it is totally unnecessary. Especially seeing how acclaimed this ending was supposed to have been it is doubly disappointing therefore. \nThen of course there are the performances. Tyrone Power is quite good in this by being frantic and consistently innocent-looking. Charles Laughton gives a spectacular performance which is both hilariously funny and very impressive and compelling at the same time. Marlene Dietrich, however, is nowhere near as good. Actually I thought she was really annoying and bad. Her performance at the end was so overdone and silly that I couldn't help not taking the ending seriously, which probably factors into my above statements on the ending's quality.\nOverall, a good film made great by some of the performances and the excellent cinematography and photography and the first three quarters of the film. Other than that, it's hard to look on this as the magnificent film it is supposed to be.",

I was astounded by Tyrone Power's role as the victim, and Marlene Dietrich's as his seemingly tyrannic wife. The ending is by far the greatest shock twist I've ever seen, but when I look at it, it was a combination of Power and Marlene Dietrich's performances that really made the ending exceptional. Plus of course that cockney woman at the station. Tyrone Power's last role might have also been his best, and that is what boggled my mind: the multiplicity of his onscreen character.\n\nThe second mention-worthy fact is the other couple - Charles Laughton as the candid barrister Sir Wilfrid Robards, and Elsa Lanchester as his forever tailing nurse Miss Plimsoll. The inclusion of the latter was Billy Wilder's decision, but it only made this already enjoyable film more so. Overall, I would say that the best part of this very worthwhile drama lies in its performances: Power and Dietrich as the duplicitous couple, and Laughton and Lanchester as the humorous one.  Witness For The Prosecution is delightful mainly because of that, as well as of course Wilder's brilliant direction.",

That's what will make audiences remember it long after the film is over. But something else that made the picture stand out to me was the characterization it gave. I'm always impressed when genres like courtroom drama do this because it's something that doesn't really seem like it \"needs\" to be done. Sure the film could have been just as great without so much detail in the characters. If the audience had never become so close with the character of the defense attorney and the way his health is deteriorating and his refusal to abandon old habits like cigar smoking, they would have been fine. But those extra details are always what makes a good film a great film, and the same applies here.\r\nThe plot is fantastically done, as I have already said. This is largely with thanks to the screenplay written by Larry Marcus, Billy Wilder, and Harry Kurnitz. This screenplay has audiences at the edge of their seats every moment and at no point does it let up. \r\nNow Billy Wilder is absolutely fantastic as a director. This is my fifth Billy Wilder film(Sunset Boulevard, Double Indemnity, Some Like it Hot, and The Apartment in chronological viewing order), yet my least favorite in terms of direction style. Not that he lacks any, but Witness For the Prosecution is unfortunately low in its visual stamina. I have known Billy Wilder to sneak in some pretty intriguing visuals of some kind, whether they be in the sets, costumes, or camera styles, but Witness For the Prosecution did not have as much of that.\r\nEven so, this is a smash of a courtroom drama and a must-see for any fan of the genre.\r\n9/10",

I watched the movie recently for the first time and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid the ending is easily predicted soon after Marlene Dietrich makes her first appearance. The movie, based on the Agatha Christie stage play is still a pretty good court room drama. Tyrone Power gives a very wooden performance as the man accused of murder who seeks out Laughton to defend him in court. Laughton and Elsa Lanchester are very good and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m convinced more than ever that Marlene Dietrich was one of the over-rated actresses of her time and not very convincing in this movie. While not one of Billy Wilder\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best movies, even his lesser movies are more entertaining than half of what comes out of Hollywood today. His other dramas like \u00e2\u0080\u009cAce in the Hole,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cDouble Indemnity\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cStalag 17\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cSunset Boulevard\u00e2\u0080\u009d stand up far better to repeat viewings than the dated \u00e2\u0080\u009cWitness for the Prosecution.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

The little disputes with his nurse (or real-life wife Else Lanchester) were hilarious. Those two, along with the never aging Marlene Deitrich, were terrific. Great and twisted storyline along with good dialogue. Certainly a different film in comparison with the court masterpiece Anatomy of a Murder, another film in which I recently seen. Not as good, but still great. Another fine film under Billy Wilder's repetoire. NOTE: If you eventually see these two films, watch \"Anatomy\" before \"Witness\" because legal inaccuries can be seen in the latter of the two (and are very humourous). Also, watch for a young Ruta Lee, who sits next to Lanchester in the courtroom.",

            "content": "Spectacular. As the second Billy Wilder film I've seen to date (the first one being the magnificent Double Indemnity), I am once again mind-blown. Based on the popular play by the masterful Agatha Christie-- my favorite author, by the way-- this courtroom drama is a terrific crowd-pleaser that delivers a great amount of suspense and shock as the story unfolds. The acting is superb, especially from the magnificent Marlene Dietrich, who delivers the performance of her lifetime, despite not even receiving an Academy Award nomination for it. Equally, Tyrone Power, Charles Laughton, and Elsa Lanchester are also brilliant in this masterpiece. Ultimately, the unpredictable ending of Witness for the Prosecution is the element that perfectly puts an end to the sense of mystery and suspense felt all throughout the movie. Unfortunately, I am unable to reveal the shocking, jaw-dropping ending to you, because I would like to respect Billy Wilder's wishes of not \"divulging the secret of the ending to friends\" (this is said as the end titles show up). Of course, this is for your own good, for I am sure that you would want to enjoy this movie as much as I did.\r\n\r\nIt's one of the greatest mystery/thriller films that Hitchcock didn't direct.\r\n\r\nOverall rating:\r\n9.5/10\r\n\r\nP.S. - After having seen two Billy Wilder masterpieces, I am now hooked on his work and MUST see more. Next up: Sabrina, Some Like It Hot, and (if I can finally get my hands on it) Sunset Blvd..",

Billy Wilder directs suspense well, but the movie is stolen by a delightful and irrascible Charkes Laughton who makes his every line resonate like music.  The film also uses the proven on-screen chemistry of real-life spouses Laughton and Elsa (the Bride of Frankenstein) Lanchester who won a Golden Globe for her performance.  A tru classic not to be missed.",

I was surprised to follow a character who doesn't care about dying of a weak heart, but he refuses to let a man die for being falsely accused of a murder.  Charles Laughton made me laugh quite a bit, which surprised me.  Billy Wilder keeps his style of having humor mixed with great drama.  The twists in the film keep you interested, and one thing that it does perfectly that recent films forget is once a twist is made the previous story still needs to have a point.  There were a lot of subtle moments in the film, mostly done by Laughton, and it's worth taking a few viewings to catch all of them.",

I almost wish this was a series of movies with Laughton as a cantankerous, whale of a man, though his medical condition make up a good part of his character - it  would be too much but with Laughton you can really never get too much. it says it all that the actor, usually troublesome for directors, nor only behaved himself professionally but was there on days off to give other actors their line reactions. he's given a helluva character and Wilders script is hilarious and seriously intriguing",
