When the first part of the spirit's prophecy comes true, Washizu's scheming wife, Asaji (Isuzu Yamada), presses him to speed up the rest of the spirit's prophecy by murdering his lord and usurping his place. Director Akira Kurosawa's resetting of William Shakespeare's \"Macbeth\" in feudal Japan is one of his most acclaimed films.",

Minimalistic sets and locations invoke a desired feeling of it being just a cautionary tale with classical Japanese flutes and drums that enhance the play angle. But as with almost every Kurosawa adaptation of western works, during the streamlining of the plot or characters, something gets lost along the way. This time it's the agency part of \"Macbeth\" and any tangible ambition of \"Lady Macbeth\". There are gaps in their portrayals, which are brought about by a very brisk pacing or simply trimming the characters. Mifune essentially becomes driven by paranoia and fear rather than any ambition, and Isuzu Yamada, well, she is portrayed with such incoherent wickedness that it carves up the character. There is no \"unsex me here\" scene. Hence, her malice and later going insane out of guilt just don't match. You wouldn't be wrong to assume that she might have been possessed or something. However, what completely elevates the film is the masterful third. This is where the changes are not only justified but play in favor of this version, making it extremely unique.",

Breathtaking cinematography and a less conventional samurai tale makes it a different experience compared to seven samurai etc. There's no real katana on katana action and duels.

Even though I know the story of Macbeth and obviously knew where the story was heading the performances and visual brilliance will keep you gripped. My only wish for the mostly masterpiece movie was more showing of Mikis son plotting for revenge and more of his aspirations against the mad Washizu.",

            "content": "Most of the actors' expressions stay the same, but I feel like they give some emotions into their lines. On the other hand, the main character has exaggerated facial expressions (maybe a bit too much for my taste).\n\nKurosawa (the director) originally wanted to write the screenplay and hire another director to make the movie but that didn't happen in the end. He wanted to take the play and put it in Japan, mixing 2 different cultures. He shot the film for the audience to be a lesson, not become part of the movie, we're not supposed to sympathize with the characters. I think that the director did an excellent job processing the play into a movie set in Japan (Cinephilia & Beyond). It keeps the important elements from the original play, but some side elements/events are changed. \n\nSome differences between the original and this are, Macbeth is a play this is a movie, Macbeth is set in Scotland, Throne of Blood in Japan, in Macbeth you have 3 witches that tell the prophecy in Throne of Blood its 1 spirit of the forest and then also the other prophecy about how the main character will die is different in both versions (Quora). On the other hand, what's the same is that symbolism plays a big role, power/ambition corrupts some characters and their wives get mad.\n\nEven though it's not a movie I would probably enjoy watching again, I recommend watching it. The reason is that I think not many people have seen any old, Asian, black, and white movies and this could be a good experience. I also think almost everybody saw Macbeth or at least know the story and after watching this they could compare it and make their own opinion. (fun fact Michael Fassbender, who plays Macbeth in the 2015 movie, says that Throne of Blood is his favourite version of Macbeth (Fliist).)",

The many scenes on horseback — especially riding through the tangling forest — are breathtaking and the practical effects of the castles and soldiers are commendable, but there is just a lull that doesn't appear in the Scottish Play that does in this one. A Kurosawa regular, Toshiro Mifune, is the central character of Washizu Taketok, our Macbeth. And boy, are his facial expressions a masterclass in acting, which makes his anticipated descent into madness that much more enjoyable. Isuzu Yamada as Washizu Asaji, or Lady Macbeth, is also a haunting character, pulling at her husband's strings until he has ascended to power — Feudal Japan's Cersei Lannister. Except, given the time period, Asaji is deferential to her husband even while \"providing\" directions; always looking to the floor, always on bended knees. Isuzu's interpretation of the \"guilt spot\" from the play is her incessant washing of hands to remove the phantom blood, which she does phenomenally. Another change from the play is that instead of three witches, we get one creepy-ass spirit (Chieko Naniwa), who is wholly entertaining, especially when we first meet her. If you're going to watch one scene, it has to be when Taketok's own men turn on him in a seemingly never-ending fury of arrows — it's a delightful spectacle.",

            "content": "A slow burn Macbeth with samurai!\n\nAkira Kurosawa's war epic Throne of Blood (1957) is a mystical retelling of William Shakespeare's legendary play Macbeth. This time arming Macbeth with a katana and spear, Kurosawa finds anxiety, paranoia, delirium, and haunting magic within Macbeth as he turns a period drama into a Japanese horror fable. I still prefer Orson Welles' classic film adaptation of Macbeth, but Akira Kurosawa makes Macbeth his own haunting playground with Throne of Blood.\n\nI cannot overstate how much I love and appreciate Kurosawa's direction for Throne of Blood with haunting atmosphere brought about by fog filled forests and eerie spaces of isolation. Whether characters are aimlessly riding horseback, wandering through the forest on foot, or pacing back and forth in their room, Throne of Blood is rife with suspense. I was riveted by the tension of decisions that must be made and the striking ghostly appearance. Kurosawa's direction is compelling to the bittersweet end. \n\nI really found Asakazu Nakai's cinematography for Throne of Blood striking. The ultra wide shots of horses galloping full speed across dark fields or sprinting through fog in the forest to be wonderfully haunting. Let Throne of Blood enshroud you in a chilling fog of nightmares and destiny. Masanori Kobayashi's make-up is excellent, especially for Toshiro Mifune in his gaunt getup. Yoshiro Muraki's samurai costumes are as cool as feudal era Japan outfits get. From layered armor, individualized flags, ornate swords, minimalist sets, and decorative kimonos, Throne of Blood visually has it all.\n\nMacbeth really is all about choice. No one makes him commit atrocities, yet he does them because he heard a prophecy. Macbeth is the quintessential example of a self fulfilling prophecy as he continually chooses the path of violence, greed, and cruelty all while screaming about the disloyalty of others. He commits regicide and still feigns virtue. Here, the raving Toshiro Mifune is perfectly cast as the mad Macbeth stand-in Taketori Washizu. His brutal antics and brooding plotting is fun to watch. Mifune is always funny as he plays eccentric characters, but in Throne of Blood he twists his manic energy into one of hellish deviousnesses with a penchant for deception. His shocked faces and yells during the arrow finale is just something else.\n\nI really enjoyed Isuzu Yamada as Lady Asaji Washizu. Her Lady Macbeth portrayal is cold and calculating instead of raving mad with desires of ambition. Her depiction is full of quiet, subtle moments to convince Mifune to act out his murderous scheme. Akira Kubo is interesting as Mifune's partner in crime Yoshiteru Miki. His nonchalance in conspiring to regicide is just a lecherous as Washizu's part in his murder plot. Takashi Shimura has a nice supporting role as Noriyasu Odagura. His brilliant plan to camouflage their army in shrubbery, foliage, and entire trees leads to the coolest imagery of Mifune looking out the window to moving trees coming for him. Samurais charging will always be cool imagery, but lethargically shifting trees with clear forward momentum is just striking filmmaking. \n\nI wish Throne of Blood had better music instead of a slightly annoying flute melody to go above the lackluster classical score from Masaru Sato. If Sato had composed more music for underneath some of the drier scenes, Throne of Blood might have felt less of a drag to get through. Far too much of Throne of Blood is left empty in silence, which just isn't that fun or contemplative as there's not that much ambient sounds here either.\n\nSo I must mention that Throne of Blood is one of Akira Kurosawa's slowest films. It's clearly deliberate on Kurosawa's part as editor because characters are anxiously awaiting for news from the battlefield or the whereabouts of their foes. However, I have to be completely honest and say that Throne of Blood meanders a lot more than Kurosawa's other features. You get lots of edits of actors riding horses across fields and wandering around the woods. This is genuinely creepy and builds atmosphere, but it could have been more tightly edited by Kurosawa without having long shots that linger far too long. The slow song that the evil spirit sings is embarrassingly slow much like the long-winded opening announcing the battle was won. For being 108 minutes, Throne of Blood feels twice that length unlike Kurosawa's other briskly paced films. Throne of Blood is impressively directed and crafted, but I find Kurosawa's pacing here to not hold up to contemporary standards.\n\nSo, I would recommend Throne of Blood for fans of unorthodox Shakespeare adaptations and samurai film fans, but the average movie-goer might fall asleep before getting to the ghostly prophet, let alone the fantastic arrow riddled finale.",

            "content": " I have favorite films that feature some type of prophecy in them, so it’s not a plot device that is a deal-breaker for me. However, early on in Throne of Blood there is a prophecy that is entirely too detailed. It shares basically all the major steps that the film will take and only leaves us to wonder the details of how that will happen. And, because I’ve seen a movie before, I know that these things will inevitably come true (otherwise, what we be the point of the prophecy.) As a result, the film felt like a waiting game. I couldn’t stop feeling like it was dragging the whole way through because I knew where it would end. It also doesn’t take the most pleasant path to get to that conclusion, which turned me off at times. Also, the art on the DVD box spoiled one of the climactic shots of the film, so I even saw that coming. There’s simply something flat and uninteresting about watching a movie when you don’t have any mystery about what will happen next. That’s not to say that the film is entirely without merit. I do like the exploration of the fact that knowing the future can change our future. It could be argued that none of the events that take place in the film would have happened if the two main characters didn’t already know they were going to happen. This kind of causality loop is fascinating to me, and is the kind of thing I like to explore in time travel movies. But this movie doesn’t seem all that interested in exploring that conundrum, instead it’s more about watching the main character driven crazy by paranoia. I also wanted to mention that this is the second or third Kurosawa movie where a manipulative wife has ruined things for the main character. I’m not sure if it’s a cultural thing, or Kurosawa doesn’t like women all that much, but it sure makes Isuzu Yamada seem like the villain of the entire story. Aside from that, there are some interesting aspects to Throne of Blood, but it simply dragged too much for me and felt extremely depressing. It’s in contention for my least favorite Kurosawa film at this point (which is still better than the best movies from some lesser directors.)",

Kurosawa sets the tone early on with shrouds of mist on a stark landscape, and we know we're in for something special.  Soon we see two returning samurai heroes (Toshiro Mifune and Minoru Chiaki) riding through the labyrinth of a forest during a rainstorm, where they meet a ghostly spirit (Chieko Naniwa).  In a fantastic sequence, she speaks of man's transience in an other-worldly voice, and while turning her simple spinning wheel, foretells each of the men's futures.  Mifune will eventually be lord of the realm, and Chiaki's son (Akira Kubo) will succeed him.  They seem like a good fates to have, but the men don't fully appreciate the danger or subtlety in her words, something that will happen again later in the film.\n\nI love the scene where Mifune's wife (Isuzu Yamada) first starts planting devious seeds with her cold, calculating comments, her face emotionless, all while looking downward.  He knows her suggestions are dishonorable and evil, and yet, as the horse outside in the background cants around in a circle, so do the thoughts within his mind.  Mifune and Yamada are excellent and a study in contrasts, perhaps illustrating the different forms greed can take, one dispassionate and the other reckless, but both leading to disaster.  \n\nThe story of Macbeth is well known and so what happens isn't a shock, and yet, it's so well-told and transplanted to feudal Japan, the film is riveting.  The period costumes were wonderful, and I loved the headgear the samurai wore.   Kurosawa gives us a variety of visuals - the stark interiors, ghostly spirits, and armies charging into battle.  Throughout it all, there is a dreamy, nightmarish, epic feeling to the film.  Men with passions stirred, riding around in the fog, lost - what a brilliant metaphor to life and human folly.  The scene towards the end, the one with archers hurling volley after volley of arrows at Mifune, is outstanding, and even more so when we discover that they were real arrows.  \n\nIt's interesting to think what would have happened if Mifune/Macbeth hadn't met the spirit in the forest, which set the wheels in motion with his wife.  Is it inevitable, and tragedy pre-ordained?  I think the story is telling us yes, and that in a larger sense, people invariably bring trouble and ruin onto themselves through greed, instead of simply counting their blessings and enjoying their too-short lives.  William Shakespeare and Akira Kurosawa make for a potent combination.",

Washizu will be promoted and will ultimately be leader of the realm.  Miki will also be promoted and his son will eventually be leader of the realm.  Both immediately dismiss these utterances but once they are promoted, they start to believe them.  Washizu is spurred on by his ambitious, scheming wife, Asaji.  When a chance comes to kill the current leader, Washizu seizes upon it.\n\nDirected (and co-written) by the famed Japanese director Akira Kurosawa and based on William Shakespeare's MacBeth, this is a great adaptation of the classic play.  The central plot remains roughly the same but Kurosawa changes the setting, dialogue and sub-plots.  Gives it a fresh look without changing the broader story.\n\nSolid direction by Kurosawa and a commanding performance by Toshiro Mifune (Kurosawa's go-to guy for many of his movies).\n\nOnly thing that prevents this from being an absolutely compelling masterpiece is that, if you know the story of MacBeth, you know how the plot unfolds.  This dampens the impact of some of the twists.  It also makes some scenes seem overly long and tedious, as you want to get to the good bit you know is coming.  Kurosawa did his best to make the plot seem new, but you can't avoid the central plot, which is all MacBeth.",

Love the use of fog smoke during the opening scene. Definitely gives off a creepy ominous vibe that fits the whole story of Macbeth. Love love love the music in this movie! It compliments everything beautifully! The construction of the castles and forts is amazing. It's incredible how they actually built these enormous sets from the ground up. Kurosawa definitely paid no expense at realizing his dream of making this adaptation. The production quality and scale is impressive. I mean he is a master craftsman perfectionist, so it makes sense. \n\nThe prophetic spirit in the forest was so creepy. I love how they introduce her into the story. The way she sings about the fate of Captain Washizu and Miki with both of their presence there. Her voice is so unsettling. Calm but distorted to sound like more than one person is talking. The way she vanishes. That special effect was beautifully done. \n\nWashizu's wife is even more creepier than the spirit in the forest. The way she manipulates and twists his thoughts is so vile and ominous. It's almost as if she's being controlled or possessed by a spirit herself. Perhaps the same spirit in the forest? She shares a striking resemblance with the same cold dead demeanor that the spirit had. It's so crazy when Washizu and Miki see each other at Forest Castle. You can see in Miki's face that he knows Washizu betrayed and killed his lordship just as the prophecy said. That's so crazy how Miki's ghost paid him a visit during the dinner letting him know that he is now dead. And now Asaji's baby was born stillborn and she is now on the verge of dying. You see what happens when you try and defy a prophecy that's told to you by a forest hag? Lol. No but seriously, they shouldn't have meddled with the plans that were already foretold. Asaji was the one to blame for everything going horribly wrong. Starting with the betrayal and killing of Miki. This is why you don't marry crazy women and then let them run your kingdom and ruin your life lol. Holy shit! That shot of the foggy forest being right below them was so good! So creepy and haunting. They're definitely in the spider web castle now. Those practical effects with the arrows were so good. How ironic that he dies at the hands of the same weapon he wielded at the beginning. \n\nI love how this movie incorporates Japanese ghost and folktale elements that are relevant in Japanese stories. A brilliant cautionary tale about the downfalls of blind ambition and being overly prideful. Masterfully crafted. The costumes and clothes look amazing. The robes look so luxurious and rich in thread count, and the military gear looks like they borrowed them straight from a museum. You can tell there was a lot of thought and planning that went into making this movie. The music is brilliant, almost playing as a character of its own throughout the movie. Beautifully filmed, the cinematography and camera work is both poetic and masterful. Probably the best Macbeth adaptation, right next to Polanski's. I'd definitely watch it again.",

Behind the camera, Kurasawa expertly adapts Macbeth to feudal Japan, capturing the main themes while making it his own story.  There are some changes to fit the Japanese setting, such as Asaji playing a more active role in pulling off Washizu's crimes, while also incorporating from Japanese Not theater.  While the film isn't quite as epic as \"Seven Samurai\" or \"Ran\", this remains one of Kurasawa's finest films and the best adaptation of 'Macbeth' to date.",

All of the Kurosawa trademarks are here somewhere, they just never jump out at us, or come together in a way that really reels us in.\nHowever, Throne of Blood isn't without its merits or moments of greatness - Toshiro Mifune, for example, is, in a word, mental.

This couldn't be farther from the truth; the visuals are stunning, constant fog adding a surreal quality to an already haunting landscape, ghostly characters silently slithering around corners and disappearing into dark doorways, magnificently composed battle sequences made up of hundreds of extras, and the simple adaptation of the Shakespeare play distilling the wordy source material into something more intent on cultivating a mood than utilizing wordplay.

            "content": "When you get a film made by Akira Kurosawa you just expect brilliance and usually a nice change of pace from the modern films we see today. Yes Throne of Blood is no exception to that, and this is coming from me who has kind of disliked a Kurosawa film in the past, but this is just great. It's a really engaging movie yet enjoyable as well and that really culminates in the final parts of the picture to make a film not only interesting but actually exciting as well, the slight action involved is great, the remake of Macbeth is done well (although of course some fans of Shakespeare may not be best pleased by this adaption) and the acting is one that really shocks me because it almost feels like acting that would be still be great years and years after this was made.\n\nOf course the main actor and really the man who could even be said to steal the show from even Akira Kurosawa, is Toshiro Mifune who for me is a top actor, and especially when playing a samurai. Of course many will point to \"Seven Samurai\" and \"Rashomon\" as his finest performances and collaborations with Kurosawa, but for me never forget this one because he is very good indeed, out doing the entire cast and the movie without him would have possibly suffered greatly. I think without Kurosawa's directing you would also be seeing a worse off film because he really brings this to life and the story just bursts from the screen in the early moments and that heavy rain mixed with dense fog and swaying but eerily silent trees make this not only a great plot, but also ascetically incredible.\n\nI must mention of course the rest of the cast including such people as Isuzu Yamada, Minoru Chiaki and Takashi Shimura who join a cast who are relatively good but never good enough to match Mifune. The way in which Kurosawa's direction works is that he seems to just know how to make you focus on the scene, whether that is through a character gone mad, a battle or even the rain etc that I mentioned. When you add everything together it is Kurosawa who then surprises you, and this is in a story where you know how it ends, but it doesn't matter because not only is this set in feudal Japan, but also because Kurosawa makes the story fresh and lively. \n\nI'm not quite sure if this is his very best mostly based on the fact that Kurosawa seems to just make what people consider great movies over and over again. One thing I do want to say though is that if you're really looking for a great feel of a film, the kind of movie where you become entwined in the plot and the atmosphere, this is definitely one to watch of that as it just seems to draw you in at every turn. If your new to Kurosawa then this is a great place to start, it's not only really likeable but also at times just a nice little yarn to watch, and of course to mention this is a great watch for any aspiring director who wants to learn how Akira seems to do it.\n\nI think as movies go this is one I maybe watched with slight apprehension over what to expect but came out very much liking it and it was really good as well. So there you have it, Macbeth set in Japan, a kind of movie where there probably won't be one like it ever again because it's just so different (and Macbeth in samurai set Japan). Wonder at the skills of Kurosawa and Mifune, confuse yourself over who is really the bad person in this, and don't try and look out for Macduff, he's apparently called Noriyasu now.",

Seven Samurai was his masterpiece, but Throne of Blood continues the tradition of telling a very good story set during the time of the Samurai. With tense atmosphere to really elevate the plot, Throne of Blood delivers a stunning film experience that captivates you from start to finish. Akira Kurosawa's always managed to tell sweeping stories with his films, and in doing so, he was able to make several highly entertaining and memorable pictures.

Overall this is a beautiful piece of cinema that wonderfully shot, and Kurosawa's always knew how to craft picture that used breathtaking cinematography to really elevate the film in a way that it needed to be. In the case of this film, the cinematography helps set the tone, atmosphere that is needed to tell such a story, and it makes for a truly engrossing and highly memorable picture that is sure to appeal to genre fans looking for bold, atmospheric and ultimately epic films that tell simple, yet good stories to really grab your attention.  Thrones of Blood is yet another finely crafted epic from a director who has mastered the genre, and after this film, I am surprised that Kurosawa has always kept making consistent films.

General Miki (Minoru Chiaki) and General Washizu (Toshiro Mifune) are two Samurais who work for local war lord Lord Tsuzuki (Takamaru Sasaki), who defeat their enemies in a ferocious battle. On the way back to Tsuzuki, they come across a Forrest Spirit (Chieko Naniwa), who tells them that Washizu will become Master of North Castle and later Lord of Forest Castle, while Miki will become Commander of Fort One, and his son will become Master of North Castle. Upon returning, Washizu tells this prophecy to his wife Asaji (Isuzu Yamada), who is determined to see these prophecies come true, and she plots to kill Tsuzuki, but consequences follow. It's a good take on Shakespeare's play, even though it takes a few liberties here and there, it keeps the spirit of the source very much alive, and it proves that even if you change a settling, Shakespeare's works will still translate in any language.

Sadly I wasn't so impressed with this but maybe someday, my opinion of this film would be much more optimistic but then again, that hasn't always been the case with many of the films I was \"hopeful\" for during subsequent viewings.\n\nThe film was written by Hideo Oguni, Shinobu Hashimoto, Ryuzo Kikushima, and Akira Kurosawa. The first three writers have worked with Kurosawa in multiple occasions and some on my currently personal favorite, Rashomon. Throne of Blood was based on a play written by William Shakespeare entitled Macbeth. I have very little knowledge of the works of Shakespeare as it wasn't something that I had the opportunity to study during my school years, though I do know of his work. I am very blind to the story of Macbeth, so I cannot say whether or not this film is faithful to the source material or it just takes fragments or ideas from it and the writers made it their own. So far, this has been the most easiest to tolerate of Shakespeare \"based\" films as it seems much more accessible and more easier to understand it's characters and their intentions. Though I did find characters simplistic and easy to penetrate, I kind of hoped the writers did a lot more for the protagonist. I think the character would have benefited with a bit more subtle details as throughout the film, everything about the character is found on it's surface. Then again, I have only seen the film once, and maybe I missed something that the writers were trying to project. Throne of Blood explores the ideas of murder, ambition, manipulation, betrayal, and guilt. The film's plot was simplistic but it was more interesting than I thought. Not to say the film's story is excellent by any means but it was entertaining. Throne of Blood's story, like many of Shakespeare's plays, have this heightened drama and characters seems to do things that would eventually hurt themselves. I found certain aspects of it to be really interesting, like the wife's drive for ambition and her ability to manipulate her husband in order to get what she wants, and the guilt both her and Washizu feel as their ambitions rise. I think Throne of Blood was trying to say that one must earn to gain their ambitions rather than gain it through haste and greed, as people may get hurt and at the end it would come back to bite you. The film's dialogue was good but I felt it was a tad bit too frank, with characters seemingly divulging everything about themselves through words rather than their inner expression.\n\nThrone of Blood was directed by Akira Kurosawa and he has made the film during the height of his career. It's definitely a film that a lot of people seem to adore and it is devastating that I cannot join their camp. Kurosawa has proven himself to me already as a great director through his two films Red Beard and Rashomon, exploring ideas of the human soul and how easily it could be corrupted, and also what we must do in order to change this. Throne of Blood on the other hand is much more simplistic and isn't as thematically deep as I hoped it would be. It felt like Kurosawa was more focused on trying to evoke thrills and emotions that leaves us to be entertained rather than something smart and thoughtful. Throne of Blood does at moments, try to be a character study but the film seems to be more preoccupied with it's story instead. The film doesn't move very fast, with some moments that feel a tad bit indulgent. The first act of the film felt a tad bit too stretched for my liking and would have benefited with a bit more haste, or instead gave me something to latch onto and be deeply invested in which he didn't. The second-third act of the film did start to move things along as we started to see the heightened drama that made the film pretty fun to watch. I was impressed with the way Kurosawa handled the spiritual or supernatural element of the film. The effects that Kurosawa used on these sequences were definitely entertaining and convincing to see, particularly the \"drunk\" sequence and the first meeting of the spirit. The director's use of the fog actually gave the story more weight, like as if everything that is happening is through the control of a much powerful being. I was also impressed on the way Kurosawa adapted a Shakespearean story onto a different setting but still attain that quality that are commonly found through Shakespeare's work.\n\nThe film's director of photography was Asakazu Nakai, who has also worked on notable films like Ran, Seven Samurai, Ikiru and Red Beard. I was content with the way he shot Throne of Blood, but I cannot help but think it could have been more cinematic. The film did contain the occasional zooms that tries to have the audience be more in tune with it's characters and the camera moved around more than I thought it would, but some shots just feel generic. It would have been nice if there were more unconventional strategies in shooting a particular scene. This is not to say that there weren't any great shots in Throne of Blood. The scenes during the first half of the film between Taketoki and Asaji Washizu, before the complication, was shot really well. Nakai created this style of lighting that created this very minimally lit room as both characters discuss the murder they were about to commit. The scene looked like it took place within a room of a medieval castle, similar to what would be found in \"faithful\" adaptations of a Shakespeare play, I don't know if this was intentional or not. The scene where Taketoki Washizu was drunk and repeatedly saw visions of his friend, was really well composed. The camera moved and panned very smoothly, following our protagonist; letting us view the spot where the spirit sits through both the perspective our protagonist and the others around him. The scene at the end with the trees were particularly impressive, and had me convinced for a second that they were actually walking trees. Also the fog also gave certain scenes a spiritual look that made the idea of the supernatural very convincing. There were also a couple of time I noticed that Taketoki Washizu was shot directly at the centre of the screen, I think it was to create that sense of ego from the character and how powerful this man has become.\n\nThe film's score was composed by Masaru Sato, who like Asakazu Nakai, have worked with the director frequently. I wasn't really wild with his score here, as I felt that the score didn't make any real presence throughout the film. A good score is able to say something about the story or it's characters and either heightening or complementing with the cinematographer's imagery or gain an emotional reaction from it's audience. The score just didn't do anything for me. Though the deep mystical chanting at the start and end of the films were actually pretty good.\n\nThough the film's writing was a bit too shallow for my tastes, I thought the actors did a wonderful job in trying to show more of their characters. The film's protagonist, Taketoki Washizu, was played by Toshiro Mifune. Mifune was quite good in the role, a man who has been corrupted by his wife to become ambitious and untrustworthy. Throughout the film we see the character battling with the demons inside him and this is all due to the actor's facial and body expression. I think his best scene was when he was arguing with his wife the paranoia of the Lord and his best friend trying to betray and kill him. He was also great during the scene where he sees spiritual visions of his best friend, with terror and anger driving his facial emotion and actions. Isuzu Yamada as Lady Asaji Washizu was also impressive. Just the small thing that she does, makes the intentions of her character feel convincing. Minoru Chiaki as Yoshiaki Miki was great in the role but there wasn't enough screen time for the character for me to actually completely praise the actor. Though his scene with Akira Kubo was really well acted.\n\nI can see the qualities that Throne of Blood great and a favorite for many but the problems I had with the film's characters, emphasis on entertainment rather than themes, and underwhelming score really hurt my experience.",

I decided to give Throne of Blood a watch because it's story seems really engaging. Sadly I wasn't so impressed with this but maybe someday, my opinion of this film would be much more optimistic but then again, that hasn't always been the case with many of the films I was \"hopeful\" for during subsequent viewings.\n\nThe film was written by Hideo Oguni, Shinobu Hashimoto, Ryuzo Kikushima, and Akira Kurosawa. The first three writers have worked with Kurosawa in multiple occasions and some on my currently personal favorite, Rashomon. Throne of Blood was based on a play written by William Shakespeare entitled Macbeth.

            "content": "Is there nothing Akira Kurosawa couldn't do? Though I've only seen a handful of his films, so far, that answer is a resounding, NO. Throne Of Blood is yet another masterwork from a master director. Then again, I should know better than to have even the most minor doubts about Kurosawa.\n\nThe story is Kurosawa's take on the Shakespeare play, Macbeth, only it's a Japanese period piece. After protecting Forts One and Two, Generals Washizu and Miki are invited to the castle of Lord Tsuzuki to honor their bravery. However, on their way to ceremony, the two become lost in the forest that surrounds the castle. It's there where they encounter a terrifying female spirit who tells the men their futures: Washizu will be named as master of North Castle, while Miki will become commander of Fort One. But, it is also revealed that Washizu will eventually become Lord of the Forest Castle, as well as Miki's son. This particular prediction leaves Washizu feeling uneasy about his future, because the spirit never specifies how he will become Lord, nor how Miki's son will become Lord of the castle.\n\nThings go according to the spirit's first part of the prediction when the men get to the ceremony: Washizu becomes master of North Castle, while Miki becomes commander for Fort One, much to the shock of both men.\n\nFor a brief period things seem to be going okay, until Washizu's wife, Asaji, suggests the unthinkable when Lord Tsuzuki plans to stay at North Castle by telling Washizu to make the spirit's prediction come true by killing Lord Tsuzuki and taking over the Forest Castle. After much badgering and manipulation, Washizu goes along with the plan. Asaji drugs the Tsuzuki's guards while Washizu commits the horrible deed, followed Asaji planting the bloody spear on one of the guards.\n\nNaturally, the guard (Who is immediately killed Washizu as he wakes) is blamed by most people for the murder of Lord Tsuzuki, but Tsuzuki's son, Kunimaru and an adviser of Tsuzuki immediately suspect Washizu of the crime, and are forced to flee when Washizu plans to have them killed too when he names them as accomplices to the crime.\n\nDespite suspicions, Miki still holds allegiance to Washizu and doesn't believe him to be capable of the crime. But, not even Miki is safe, not even after Washizu becomes Lord of the Forest Castle as predicted. Despite the spirit saying that Miki's son will become Lord of Forest Castle, Asaji becomes pregnant and convinces Washizu that Miki and his son must be eliminated, so Miki is murdered, but his son escapes being killed.\n\nSlowly, but surely, Washizu becomes more suspicious of everyone around him and more insane as his craving for power and control seems to know no bounds, which threatens to destroy his warped little world as his alliances begin to dwindle and his misdeeds come back to haunt him.\n\nOne of the things that makes Kurosawa such a great director is his ability to take something old, and making it all seem fresh again with his own personal creative stamp. Though there are many Shakespeare-translated films, Throne Of Blood is easily one of the all-time greats of such films because everything is made with such care, such craft, and such attention to detail in even the smallest areas. The story, despite familiar ideas, is very engaging and riveting as new twists and spins are put on these ideas and characters.\n\nThe acting, as expected, is quite good, especially from legendary Japanese actor, Toshiro Mifune as Washizu who dominates the screen with his presence. His performance was electric and stunning as he fully threw himself into the role, though his cast mates were all great as well. But, if Toshiro Mifune is involved in a film, you can bet he will steal the show, and boy does he ever in Throne Of Blood.\n\nThrone Of Blood is a superb interpretation of a Shakespeare tragedy. The story feels fresh, the characters are well rounded and interesting, and the film is very engaging from start to finish as it follows the inevitable downfall of its lead character. It's well worth watching if you love a good Japanese film, or hell, a good drama.",

Mifune is his usual phenomenal self, just chewing scenery, and nailing the creeping paranoia and suspicion of Macbeth. This version really does a good job of emphasizing how important Lady Macbeth was in pushing her husband over the edge (played here as Asaji, by Isuzu Yamada, who's fantastic in a very restrained performance, which actually makes her more spooky).  The film was shot on Mount Fuji, giving it an amazing atmosphere, and there was an actual castle built on site for the set (with help from US Army Engineers). A haunting tale, set perfectly in the feudal samurai period of Japan. Kurosawa...I think I've given up on superlatives for how good he was. The final scene is just tremendous, bringing prophecy to reality, and Mifune's eyes alone in this last scene do a better acting job than a majority of actors working today do with their entire bodies.\nAnother nearly flawless classic.",

You can't! And they didn't. Oh my God this was all that and a bag of chips.

But perhaps my most favorite part of the entire film was the arrow scene, it was simply stupendous!!! That entire sequence was more impressive than any CG fx I have seen or could ever hope to see because those were real arrows being shot at the real-life actor by real archers and when you hear those arrow \"schtick\" to the wooden walls behind or beside him, that's not sound effects added later on; that was the sound of real arrows points, sinking in real wooden boards.

Light on action, and high on drama Throne of Blood gives a truly haunting portrayal of what people are prepared to do if given even the smallest window of opportunity. It features many memorable scenes and shots, perhaps none more bone chilling than a vision of Washizu's wife Asaji as she first descends into darkness only to emerge stone-faced and more motivated than ever.

Indeed, the only weak point the film has is its slightly confused vision of the witch, both suggesting that it defines Washizu's fate and reducing its presence from Shakespeare's work. This film is yet another great entry into the canon of both Shakespeare filmography and Akira Kurosawa.",

            "content": "From the Criterion Collection Spine Number 190.\n\n\nThrone of Blood is a masterpiece by one of the world's greatest film makers at the height of his powers.\n\nOnly Kurosawa could take the essence of Shakespearian stage drama and incorporate it into the medium of film as a dynamic tour de force. Yet at the same time he remains faithful to elements of Noh (a stagy traditional Japanese play-form in which design and movement are minimalized). A seeming contradiction, dynamism and static-ness yet Kurosawa masters both in the same medium. As usual; acting, writing, cinematography, sound, direction and production are all pitch perfect.\n\nIn this second Shakespearian based film by Kurosawa, focus is on the interplay of fate, free will and the fine thread the human psyche uses to weave the two together. On a more simpler level it is a man living and dying by the sword. In short what goes around comes around. What comes around for Toshiro Mifune as he gets his just deserts is a scene with straight as an arrow, perfect direction by Kurosawa leading to quite a pointed culminatin of events (pun intended...see the movie you'll understand).\n\nBonus features include excellent linear notes as well as the superb commentary of Donald Richie. Few people are more knowledgeable about film and Japanese film then he. The commentary is almost as interesting as the movie itself.\n\nAs usual Criterion presents its film in pristine condition. Some may complain that Criterion is too pricey but with them you get the best cinema has to offer. You cannot go wrong. One Kurosawa masterpiece packs more poignancy, punch and philosophy then 10 lesser films thus you get 10 times the movie at 5 times the price, really quite a deal if you look at it that way,  3-8-13",

It succeeds largely because Kurosawa, being such a master of image, is unhindered by verbose Elizabethan dialogue, and employs his gifts as a visual storyteller to great effect. Scenes which the Bard had happily soliloquized, Kurosawa treats with meaningful silence. He masterfully translates Shakespeare's pathetic fallacy from page to screen, the mist shrouded fields and forests of feudal Japan filling in nicely for Scotland's blasted heaths. There's a bit of fat to trim, but otherwise it's thoughtfully timed, and Toshiro Mifune's performance as Washizu (Macbeth) is a bit much, but hey, it's Shakespeare.",

His rapid descent into lunacy is vibrant and ensnaring, especially when he's fully lost the plot, dodging arrows in the unforgettable penultimate scene.

Somehow he manages to create epic movies that are at the same time introspective, dealing with Man's innermost feelings, dreams, ambitions... I know that this is a Shakespeare adaptation, as was Ran.

Toshiro Mifune who is definitely my favorite Japanese actor of all time gives us yet another awesome performance as the guilt stricken Washizu but somehow he is also given a good run for his money in acting by Isuzu Yamada who plays his power hungry wife Asaji. There are many highlights when you watch this movie such as the encounter with the spirit in the forest for example but for me the climax tops it all when Washizu's treachery is discovered by his men and they start to shoot a load of arrows on him in his fortress.

What makes any good adaptation stand out is not the simple adherence to the source material, but a willingness to shape and transmogrify what is already given to the filmmaker and to make it his own.  Thanks in large part to Kurosawa's incomparable stylistic abilities, the movie is dripping in atmosphere; the sickly fog seemingly permeates every corner of the frame and the desolate landscapes provide all the environmental symbolism the film needs.  Mifune does wonders as the Japanese Macbeth, alternately weak and defiant, his portrayal is passionate above all else.  The shots are fantastic and the ending something to behold.  It is a strong production of Macbeth, but the inclusion of Japanese-theater type style (particularly in Lady Macbeth) weakened some of the story's impact.  Lady Macbeth is more a spectral figure than a power-hungry missus; this stylistic decision is one of the rare times where style usurps story rather than Kurosawa's typical ability to make the two effortlessly combine.  Fusing two cultures together invariably makes something worth discussing and this cinematic effort is no exception.",

            "content": "Akira Kurosawa's \"Throne of Blood\" is very close to my heart even though I cherish its images more than the overall product. By no means it's one of his masterpieces, but it provides us a world like no other; a place where I really wish I had lived. Kurosawa made several period films; all are different from one another, especially this one. I find him the most relatable director, I can identify with even the most minor characters. We all know it is an adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth; I have not read any of his work yet, but have seen a film or two based on it. So, I knew the story the first time I ever saw \"Throne of Blood\" and of course revisiting it now makes it even more apparent. What prevents it from being great? Its lack of attention to detail in the most important sequence; I am now convinced that there was a double used for Washizu in the climax; there are shots where the person does not like Toshiro Mifune at all. If this is false, I still take my stand because the viewer should never be allowed to think that! And it seems so obvious! A shot involving a single arrow also does not look genuine. As great as Mifune is as Washizu he is at times unconvincing: close-up of him where he is about to commit a deed, when he accuses himself of being a fool, and when he is last seen with his wife. Yes, it is set in feudal Japan, but this is more of a character study than a showcase of battle, so I think his performance could have been improved; thus exposing his inner struggle to its best abilities, it needed emotional restrain, as well as the ferocity Mifune provides. Here is a film with unlimited potential; the first time I revisited I was ready to declare it as one of the ten or twenty greatest films (first half). It has themes to be the best work of Kurosawa; such a great story in abstract, extraordinary cinematography and likely the best actor-director combination. I was spell bounded by the sequence where Washizu and Miki are lost in the fog; it's as great of a sequence as you can see in a film. Kurosawa's use of rain, among other weather conditions is unmatched. And we know him as a great humanist, but I will point out that he has an extraordinary ability to create horror-like, chilling scenes; as shown first in \"Rashomon,\" and later on in \"Throne of Blood.\" Who captures movement better than Kurosawa? The sequences involving the spirits are the best parts; especially the last one where Mifune delivers an unbelievably powerful monologue; the best voice an actor can have! I was very impressed with Isuzu Yamada's performance also; she plays the wife of Mifune. To some measure, \"Throne of Blood\" does least with more, whereas \"Red Beard\" does most with least. It is more of a static picture, where as \"Seven Samurai,\" \"Red Beard,\" or even \"Ran\" provide the viewer a feeling of resonance from the depths of one's heart. I do very much love this film, even more I am fascinated by Mifune's appearance and the kind of character his Washizu is. It would have been a masterpiece if it was a more complex character study and did not have any technical flaws. You see where Kurosawa was going with this, everything is there, I know how great this film could have been, but he and his staff were just unable to put it together entirely. At times I think it could have surpassed \"Taxi Driver\" and \"Red Beard\" as my favorite, certainly would have been up there. Still a good film, stayed about the same as in my initial viewing; a fine recommendation for Kurosawa beginners!",

Toshiro Mifune plays the lead giving a great performance as very intense and extremely fierce warrior. This has got to be my favorite performance of Toshiro Mifune. His acting is much more mature and his raw intensity, displayed in past films like Rashomon and Seven Samurai, was much more channeled and refined. His amazing performance and Kurosawa's great execution make this my favorite film of his as well. The ominous mood of the film is set well by Kurosawa using ample fog and various sounds including screeching of crows and Noh music.

Dressed in Noh make-up, slow-moving like the world's most effective predator, unblinking, she is, without a doubt, the true lady Macbeth. She turns Mifune to a murder, and, although she is seen going mad at the end, we do not see her die. With a demonic stillness that cracks into physical action only when she is completely sure of herself or in utter desperation. It is one of the most disturbing characterizations I have ever encountered. This, also is one of the very few Kurosawa films where a woman plays a very important role.\r\n\r\nThe tragedy of the tale is elevated by the fact that the viewers are told at the start what will happen. It is to be noted that Kurosawa started his directional career with radical and modern noir films, like Stray Dog and High & Low, and gradually became traditionalist as his career went on. This movie is a turning point for Kurosawa as he started to move away from the radicalism and western influences of his earlier movies, to utilizing traditional Japanese theater.

Not so here. This film's lady is Asaji, played by a Japanese woman wearing heavy makeup, designed to resemble a mask, and layers upon layers of clothing. She's creepy, aloof, ambitious and fantastic as the conspirator behind Washizu's (Macbeth's) coup. \n\nThe sound of Asaji's dress as she glides across the floor fills a pivotal scene with tension. And then there's a moment when she inspects a blood stain on the floor with glee, reveling in the evidence of past violence and the violence to come.\n\nMy quibble is the lack of one character. This telling of the play lacks the character of Macduff, one of my favorites. And since Macduff isn't there to get vengeance on Macbeth, the final scene of Washizu's undoing is several minutes of the character flailing and screaming under a barrage of arrows. It's very off-putting and almost pathetic, but that must be the way the director wanted it, to depict where Washizu's gutless, depraved ambition led him. \n\nI enjoyed watching this sub-titled version, and then gained an even better understanding listening to the commentary track. It described many  insights into how the director infused elements of Japanese theater into the film, all of which were fascinating to learn.\n\nNow I feel the need to get my Shakespeare out to read the play again.",

His first of several adaptations, seen here, is based off of \"Macbeth\" set in feudal Japan. A satisfying story remains intact, but there are a lot of superfluous asides and excess in certain parts. Filmed on Mount Fuji, the landscape is vast and beautiful - constant fog and an abundant forest set the stage as this is the closest Kurosawa probably ever came to making a suspenseful movie. There is a specific atmosphere that the film captures thanks to some harsh lighting and a scintillating score. ToshirÃ´ Mifune gives another fine performance as the crazed successor and he especially lets his talent ring in the intense conclusion. Much of the film succeeds in its pursuits, but there is plenty wrong with it as well. \"Throne of Blood\" seems like a necessary step in the director's canon and when watching it there is no doubting its influence, even if it is minor Kurosawa.",

A drama that is both creepy and mystical, Macbeth has such a pall of despair around it that many in theatre speak of it in hushed tones. (If someone could explain to me the superstition that surrounds this play, I'd appreciate it.) \n\nAfter being introduced to the ancient Greek tragedies by Sophocles later in high school did I notice quite a few parallels between Macbeth and the tale of Oedipus. But Macbeth embraces his destiny (a little TOO much) while Oedipus flees his. In both tales, each man's life spirals ever downward to a fateful end like water swirling in a drain. \n\nThe Japanese are pretty big on dramatic tragedy, so I'm not surprised that Macbeth would translate so well to their ancient Feudal history. (Kurosawa would visit Shakespeare again almost 30 years later with \"Ran\".) In fact I sometimes wonder how well Hamlet or Richard III would interpret. (Actually, I'd love to see Richard III done as a Tokugawa-era drama.) \n\nKurosawa is in pretty good form in this movie. Toshiro Mifune (Kurosawa's Al Pacino) is wearing his \"stern samurai\" hat this time (as opposed to the \"goofy samurai\" he dons in other films) looking like he had stepped out of an ancient portrait of Miyamoto Musashi. For the most part, \"Throne of Blood\" is visually compelling. \n\nMy major problem with the movie is that it starts out and progresses with all the pacing of a typical Kurosawa epic, but in the last third everything comes to a quick resolution. Too quick for my taste. It felt as if the director were under too tight of a deadline to produce an end-product. I wonder if another 30 minutes would've helped.",

The sets I found, especially the set of the evil spirit's (the three witches) den in the forest were just great.\r\n\r\nHowever I think that too much of Macbeth was left out. I don't have a problem with things being changed here and there, ya know so we are aware that this is the director's film and not a stage production, but too many things that I thought were important in the play weren't there. His estrangement from his wife isn't really elaborated on and other characters lack depth. Whilst this is true in theme to Shakespeare's Macbeth I think the story would have improved if it were truer it's source material.\r\n\r\nOh and also, I don't wanna sound like a 12 year old boy here, but I thought Macbeth would give Kurosawa an opportunity for some epic action, but this lacked a lot of it, there aren't even any sword fights! I love Kurosawa action and I can't believe there wasn't any!\r\n\r\nThis is a very good movie but its minimalism effects its entertainment value, it does not measure up to the likes of Seven Samurai and Rashomon. Despite that I'm giving it four stars.",

            "content": "Throne of Blood' is Akira Kurosawa's screen adaption of William Shakespeare's Macbeth set in medieval Japan and in my opinion the best Shakespearean adaptation of all time. It is rare to see a film that takes a source material and does so much with it, whilst remaining true to the text. I obviously do not need waste time in explaining the plot as it is known to all (if not I would suggest acquiring a complete works for around £20/$25), so I will focus on the merits of the film itself.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the film is very well cast and contains a stand out performance from Toshiro Mifune, who as many of you will know is present in most of Kurosawa's great works until their falling out after the shooting of 'Red Beard'. Mifune's performance in this film is one of the great oversights of cinema history, and in my opinion easily stands up to De Niro's 'Jake La Motta' and O'Toole's 'T.E. Lawrence'. The brilliant performance culminates in the most spectacular fashion with Mifune suffering a dramatic human pin cushion death at the hands of his own archers. Mifune manages to capture the look of desperation in a man that knows he is about to die, and uses the on screen energy he is so famous for to great effect. \r\n \r\nIn terms of direction we are truly watching the master at work. The use of wide shots of landscapes is truly mesmerising, and in many cases creates an overwhelming sense of suspense. This is a huge achievement in itself as creating suspense in a film where the audience already knows the outcome is no mean feat. There is extraordinary use of fast cuts and kineticism in the mise en scene which keeps the film going at a fast pace. This accompanied with brilliant tracking shots of peoples feet  makes you feel like you are watching an action epic, when in actual fact there is very little in terms of action in the film.\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that Kurosawa is also famed for his scriptwriting prowess, I believe that his main triumph in 'Throne of Blood' is his outstanding use of silence in scenes of dialogue. It is also very important to mention that whilst this film is fast paced, it is also subtle in the sense that rather than showing us scenes of murder, we are often left in another room for the culprit to return from the deed. Whilst at times this could be considered frustrating, the scenes are directed so well that it is a tool used to great effect.\r\n \r\nOverall, I would highly recommend this film to any fans of cinema and/or Shakespeare. The performances are outstanding and Kurosawa's direction is the best I have seen from him. Many may disagree but as an adaptation I believe it surpasses his later and more recognised film 'Ran', which I would also like to highly recommend (review of Ran coming soon).",

It is the best version of MacBeth I have ever seen on film and to consider it was made in Japan in 1957 at that.  I don't know what else to add other than what I've said.

            "content": "Throne Of Blood (Kumonosu-JÃ´) is legendary filmmaker Akira Kurosawa's masterful adaptation of William Shakespeare's classic tragedy Macbeth. He transfers Shakespeare's tale from Scotland to historical Japan. Kurosawa regular ToshirÃ´ Mifune stars as Taketoki Washizu, the equivalent to the Scottish lord Macbeth, a warrior who, along with his friend and fellow warrior Yoshaki Miki (Minoru Chiaki), find themselves lost in a dense forest during a powerful thunderstorm. Unable to get out of the woods they encounter a ghostly old woman predicting that Washizu will soon rise to great power and that Miki's son will become the Lord of the castle as well as spawning generations of heirs. At the urge of his ruthless wife Asaji (the equivalent of Lady Macbeth), played hauntingly by Isuzu Yamada, Washizu embarks on a murderously ambitious path and quickly fulfills the prophecy. However, his ascension is cursed by his brutal actions and soon opposition arises to challenge his blood-stained rule and bring about his inevitable downfall.\n\nOne of the finest Shakespeare adaptations in cinematic history, Kurosawa seamlessly brings the story to a historically accurate Japan setting with an incredible visual style. Kurosawa simplifies the original story by getting rid of minor characters and Shakespeare's famous soliloquies.  Isuzu Yamada gives a creepily unemotional take on Lady Macbeth and arguably the best take on the character even if the character isn't in the film as much as other adaptations. ToshirÃ´ Mifune shows a plentitude of intensity in his performance giving one of the best he ever gave. The cinematography, editing and costume designs like all of Kurosawa's other films are all fantastic. This is not only one of the best adaptations of  a Shakespeare play but also one of Kurosawa's most enduring films. It is essential viewing for any movie fan and anyone who enjoys the literary works of Shakespeare. The climax is one of the great moments in the history of cinema. 10/10",

Basically the film is a standard retelling of Macbeth, and I've always been of the mind that Macbeth is much better material to be discussed than to be watched or read. Not surprisingly, that transfers over to Throne of Blood mostly. It's a pretty great adaptation I suppose, despite leaving out a few things from the play, I believe. But he also injects his own themes and visual symbols, which adds more to the film, I reckon. Can't say I was blown away though or that I have much to say about the film.

But Kurosawa fails to paint a fully rendered portrait of a man at the throes of insanity. The dynamic between Taketori (Mifune) and his wife lacks any sort of conviction. The strength of Shakespeares's play lies in the relationship between these two characters, and especially in the methods which Lady Macbeth employs in order to toy around with her husband's fragile psyche. Lady Asaji on the other hand is poorly developed. Okay, so we understand that she, like her husband, is hungry for power but it is done so superficially that it fails to make any emotional impact. What we get in the end is a nagging wife without any motives and an unsympathetic push-over husband whose tragedy is so underscored that you end up shrugging your shoulders and barely refraining yourself from saying \"duhh!\".

Also, the film lacked the apology for the British army marching into Scotland and taking over, hail Brittania, as required by the Scottish play. But Lady Macbeth is quite formidable on stage, where in the film Toshiro Mifune dominates her even in his weakness, she is an extension of him where Lady Macbeth is an incarnation of something more substantial onstage.\nCan it be said to be a tragedy? Many have observed that the Scottish play is not by Aristotle's definition, as it is long on terror and short on pity: Macbeth regains himself and his sense of duty but only at the very bitter end, as in the film, a realization that is too little too late.",

            "content": "Despite not being a true adaptation of Shakespeares Macbeth, the parallels that the film draws from Macbeth make it the best version out there of Macbeth. One reason being that this film is superior to the other versions of the play is that they were not created with such visionary mannerism. The feudal system of Japan accommodates the plot of the play. Macbeth is awarded land in the play and because there was a manor system, Kurosawa was able to incorporate that in to the film. In addition to that, Macbeth from Shakespeares play would be equivalent to Samurai if he was to be placed in feudal Japan, and because there was a king in the feudal system Kurosawa was able to place the king from the play into the film. There was also a witch character that was taken from the play and just as in the play when Macbeth was promoted to King of Cawdor he became shogun in the film. Kurosawa was able to take the fighting and betrayal from the play into the film because of the setting. The setting being feudal Japan makes note of the feudal system of awarding land, protection by samurai, and protection of the great lord via warriors. Kurosawas setting puts him in an advantage because of the feudal system, which displays the many parallels from the play. With Kurosawa being one of the best film directors of all time he was able to film this movie with ease because he had a large budget at his disposal. Thus, he was capable of creating a film that was well structured executed in intense style and most of all the drama from the play. Macbeth may as well be an action adventure but in the midst of the action there is the overlooked aspect of drama; especially coming from Lady Macbeth. With that said Kurosawas usage of birds at unexpected moments and tense songs make the impression that this film was more of a drama than an action adventure. What it is timing, all of it is timing, and Kurosawa had timing. Using music when there was a miscarriage, having the birds flock in while Macbeth was in the great lords chamber, having the music cued when the women run out of Lady Macbeths room.  When comparing this film to Orson Welles small budget, over the top acting and cheesy special effects make this film look extraordinarily professional. The person who played lady Macbeth was a marvelous actor in that she displayed her emotion at full speed andto be honest is the key actor in making this film such a great one. For 1952 this film probably set a standard in filmmaking and by looking back on it, it is still an enjoyable experience. I give Throne of blood a 9.2.",

That is not at all the case here - Kurosawa shows a great appreciation for the themes and potential of the Macbeth story, and adds plenty of masterful touches of his own, creating a distinctive, memorable atmosphere and characters that come to life in their own right in addition to serving as worthy parallels to the Macbeth characters. There are many fine details that enhance both the medieval Japanese setting and also the important themes of the story itself.\n\nWhether you like Shakespeare, Kurosawa, or both, \"Throne of Blood\" is an excellent movie that should not disappoint.",

Yes, he's really good at being intense, but the one-note Noh-style performance gets tedious. There are certainly a fair share of wonderful, memorable scenes (the meetings with the spirit, the murder scene, the birds, the ending) and yet the other scenes seem to just hang there. It's not paced especially well, at least not for a Kurosawa film. Before I start sounding too much like a Grumpy Gus, though, it's still a good movie. Its exploration of ambition and treachery are powerful, and I find it interesting to meditate on the theme of free will. Could Washizu have told Asaji to fuck off, do things the honorable way, and still fulfill the prophecy? Or was he doomed from the start to go along with his wife? And if he'd made a different decision, would that have changed the spirit's second prophecy?

The set pieces are large and exquisite as well as having large suits of armor on Taketori Washizu for large portions of the film.

He plays the character brilliantly as he falls from his strong willed self into a man crazed with his own destiny and the prophecy of evil ghosts. Equally as good is Lady Asaji Washizu, played by Isuzu Yamada, who takes more initiative in her husband?s advancement than he does at first.\n\nThe film takes a bit to get going as the main character is not even seen for the opening portion of the film, but once advancements in his position start happening it builds up speed to the bloody conclusion.

She does not plant doubt in her husbands mind using impassioned arguments, but rather expresses herself in a somber, almost  melancholic tone. \n\nOn the other hand, Macbeth is portrayed as too much of a brute and I was not as happy with his character treatment.

However, it is no secret that the cinema's sole responsibility is to show rather than tell at every possible opportunity, and Kurosawa often falls under the spell of Shakespeare's weighty dialogue- poetry that works just fine for the theater and therefore becomes strangely unnecessary for a lot of these sequences. The film explores a moral conundrum Kurosawa constantly investigated and re-investigated, but he did it far better in other works.",

Been saving this DVD for the right occasion and the other night me and a bottle of sake sat back and watched in awe Kurosawa's use of imagery, pacing and light. He easily transfers Shakespeare's brilliant tragedy to the Japanese setting even staging some scenes in the traditional Noh theatre style.  Kurosawa and Mifune - pure class.",

Kurosawa's talent for creepy imagery and the overall feeling of dread throughout the film made me realize how much influence he has had on countless filmmakers the world over.  Mifune, Kurosawa's muse, shines here as Lord Washizu, playing a role he is certainly comfortable in to perfection.  I was particularly struck by Kurosawa's visualizations of spirits, as the pure white visions are some of the scariest things I've seen in all of film.  And to not mention the fantastic fog draped over a good quarter of this film would be a grave injustice.  Altogether, this is an astounding Kurosawa film, while not being his best still is a classic of the Shakespearian and Samurai genres.",

Little bit talky in the middle of the movie but Picks up steam in the end.  This flick I think has the longest Death scene ever in a Movie History.  The King would not stay Dead!",
