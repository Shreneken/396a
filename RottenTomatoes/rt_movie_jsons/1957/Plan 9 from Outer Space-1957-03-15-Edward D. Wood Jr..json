    "summary": "Residents of California's San Fernando Valley are under attack by flying saucers from outer space. The aliens, led by Eros (Dudley Manlove) and his assistant, Tanna (Joanna Lee), intend to conquer the planet by resurrecting corpses in a Hollywood cemetery. The living dead -- a cape-wearing ghoul (Bela Lugosi), a vampire (Vampira) and a slow-footed cop (Tor Johnson) who was killed for his nosiness -- stalk curious humans who wander into the cemetery looking for evidence of the UFOs.",

            "content": "La más grande obra maestra de Ed Wood que lo convirtió en el peor director de toda la historia. Plan 9 es una de esas películas chapas de la época que si bien tiene errores y una trama incoherente, es una de esas películas que entretienen y divierten por lo malas o bizarras que son. Un punto a su favor es ser la ultima aparición de Bela Lugosi en la gran pantalla después de su muerte siendo esta su gran despedida. Esta película tiene su encanto con todos esos efectos baratos y una historia rara, la película es buena a su manera y es algo que solo un amante del cine puede disfrutar. Mi nota para esta película es un 7/10.",

            "content": "What can be said ? For many years considered so bad it's almost good, and one of the worst films to come from the 1950's B movie era. However with the release of Tim Burton's  amazing \"Ed Wood\" interest was re kindled in this mostly forgotten SCI FI monster movie. \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\"  is now more of a companion piece to \"Ed Wood\" seen regularly along side the Burton classic. Much the same as \"The Room\"  ( another contender for a so bad it's almost good award ) is a companion piece to \"The Disaster Artist\" both these original films have gained popularity from the telling of the directors story.\n\n\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\" was only Known for its wobbly sets , awful acting , terrible effects , falling over props and most memorably, the switching of Bela Lugosi to another actor that doesn't speak, is taller and hides his face without any reason or context. That was of course until \" Ed Wood.\" Tim Burton paints a picture of the making of \"Plan 9 from outer space\" including the untimely death of Bella Lugosi and the way the cast and crew all worked together as outcast friends to deliver some form of movie to the public. Seen now, much like \"The Room\", \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\" has a charm and feel that elevates it. This new perspective allows the movie to give the audience something that was not present prior to the Hollywood big budget Tim Burton film. I found myself comparing scenes and looking out for the comedic incidents highlighted in \"Ed Wood\". \n\nThat said it is still an awfully poor film, but does have a new found charm as well as a sense of fun. Most notably however, it was of course the Legendary Bella Lugosi's last movie appearance.",

            "content": "One of the most incompetent, fascinating and glorious disasters ever put on screen! The acting is a mixture of not caring, cluelessness and miscasting the likes of which I haven't seen before. A lot of it I wouldn't even call acting its something though...The cinematography (And I use that in the most barebone terms possible) is incredibly bad, the music/sound design is terrible, the editing....yeah the editing.....not sure if it can even be  called editing...moving on...this leads to one of the most boring films I've ever seen. 20 minutes in felt like over an hour. So in conclusion...this is absolutely worth one watch. If your ever going to see just one bad film this is the one. It is so incompetent that you could watch this a dozen times and still see new mistakes and flaws. Normally I'd say stay away...but this is a rare exception. Give this a try so you know what a bad movie is and than never watch another bad one ever again.",

Yeah, some of it hits the \"so bad it's good\" level, the rest is cringe worthy.  The real Q is: What theatre operator was dumb enough - or cheap enough - to actually book this PoS?",

            "content": "It's all so very wrong. The directing, editing, 'acting', sets (the inside of a plane cockpit seemingly designed by someone who's never seen one let alone been in one), inappropriate music, the not even slightly 'special' effects, dialogue, pseudo science plot, etc are all unintentionally hilarious. The swapping back and forth between night and day in the same scene, the wobbling space ships, the tiny gravestones, Vampira and Tor Johnson, the use of the late great Bela Lugosi's unconnected, seeming randomly spliced test footage and his subsequent utterly unconvincing body doubles(s) are all legendary. My personal favourite moments are Dudley Manlove's hissy-fit 'you're stupid' monologue and the awesomely and utterly inappropriately camp John Cabell \"Bunny\" Breckinridge as the Supreme ruler. Utterly hilarious. The Rifftrax version with the running commentary is side splittingly funny. So utterly bad it truly is wonderful and a must watch cinematic experience for all the wrong and yet strangely right reasons. A perfect antidote to a bad day that's all but guaranteed to cheer you up and for that alone let us give thanks to Ed Wood.",

Well, it's worth watching, once, just to be able to say you've seen it.  In it's own very cringe-worthy way, even somewhat entertaining.",
