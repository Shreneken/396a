    "summary": "New York City newspaper writer J.J. Hunsecker (Burt Lancaster) holds considerable sway over public opinion with his Broadway column, but one thing that he can't control is his younger sister, Susan (Susan Harrison), who is in a relationship with aspiring jazz guitarist Steve Dallas (Marty Milner). Hunsecker strongly disproves of the romance and recruits publicist Sidney Falco (Tony Curtis) to find a way to split the couple, no matter how ruthless the method.",

Brooding intensity is always in his face, and Lancaster can be quite scary at times, never knowing when he might blowup. But the real terror comes from his oblivious madness, seeking to control everyone and everything, including his \"beloved\" sister, who he is only hurting in the process. Right there with him is the Tony Curtis' fawning Sydney, willing to throw anybody the bus in order to make a quick buck. It is a villainous duo for the ages, and one of the best of the genre.",

In the figure of J.J. Hunsecker portrayed with calculating coldness by Burt Lancaster we see an amalgamation of Charles Foster Kane's formidable megalomania and Michael Corleone's monstrous adherence to an unforgiving moral code, all appropriately buttressed by the smoky and frenetic milieu of the New York jazz scene. Tony Curtis in turn creates a peculiar counterpoint to Lancaster's domineering presence in the form of a sniveling sycophant, ever chomping at the bit to make a quick buck regardless of the degree of amorality involved. \"Sweet Smell of Success\" thus stuns us with the bitter irony of its title in its scorching portrayal of success that reeks as much as ever with the rotten stench of corruption and phony grandeur.",

            "content": "A bleak world of gritty realism and salacious dealings.\n\nAlexander Mackendrick's noir drama Sweet Smell of Success (1957) is a gripping black and white picture about how greed, capitalism, and power will allow a person to abandon morality and ethics completely for the almighty dollar. It's a parable warning against greed, cruelty, and manipulation for if you lose your integrity, you may never get your good name back. Tony Curtis is sublime as the slimy publicity agent Sidney Falco literally willing to do anything for a spot as a newspaper columnist, no matter who gets hurt. Curtis plays a real selfish jerk, who uses everyone around him to achieve such a small worthless dream. It's a masterclass in Tony Curtis' gazes of admiration or disgust at each character.\n\nBurt Lancaster is unreal as the controlling, gaslighting, creep older brother J.J. Hunsecker, willing to twist reality in order to maintain his ungodly control over his abused sister. Lancaster is such a revolting lecher, you'll hardly believe his crass manner of rude insults and insufferable arrogance to all in earshot. You will hate Lancaster by the end of this magnificent role.\n\nSusan Harrison is endearing and sympathetic as Susan Hunsecker, the clearly abused young sister to Burt Lancaster's all powerful brother J.J. Her hurt eyes and body language make you melt into sorrow. Harrison is very natural and realistic in Sweet Smell of Success. She sells you on the damage men like J.J. inflict and men like Sidney make excuses for endlessly. Similarly, Barbara Nichols is a revelation of melancholia as her poor cigarette girl Rita is tossed to predatory men like she's nothing. There's a particularly heinous scene of gross sexism that makes your blood boil and Nichols makes your heart sink into oblivion.\n\nErnest Lehman and Clifford Odets' writing is stuffed with mature wisdom, cautionary tales, seedy crimes, grotesque treatment of women, and the callous men that use them. Sweet Smell of Success' script is unique in that every single line has some deeper meaning, euphemism, significance, double entendre, or unbelievable wit. You'll be engaged just by the clever dialogue, let alone the harrowingly depressing narrative about a revolting perverse brotherly love forbidding a genuine romance.\n\nAlexander Mackendrick's direction is striking with a focused storytelling and shocking maturity for dark subject matter. Sweet Smell of Success is endlessly entertaining with Mackendrick's directorial tricks to keep you enjoying all the misery and manipulation along the way. It's amazing how daring Mackendrick was to make this timeless classic that is so revealing about newspaper men, publicity agents, and millionaire tycoons today as it was back upon its release. Alan Crosland Jr.'s editing is slick with neat cuts from faces to juxtapose the gaslit and the gaslighter. His classy cuts keep Sweet Smell of Success to a savory 97 minutes of pure pain and cinematic bliss.\n\nJames Wong Howe's stunning cinematography is impressively technical with smooth panning shots, yet it's his unique framing of Tony Curtis' face reacting to everyone insulting him and the horrible things unfolding in front of him, that he causes mind you, and he just doesn't care. Howe uses the black and white aesthetic to highlight and obscure faces with shadows and silhouettes in every scene, while he ensures all close-ups focus on the eyes of the subject to get their perspective on the tragedy before them. Mary Grant's suits are stylish and the dresses are all so pretty and fitted perfectly to each lady. Robert J. Schiffner gives Tony Curtis these dark eye make-up that makes him look perpetually tired and driven by his insatiable desire for status and currency.\n\nElmer Bernstein's score features exciting and playful jazz with moody numbers throughout Sweet Smell of Success. His music adds a New York authenticity and murky vibe that keeps you on edge for all the conservative actions and plotting on screen. The music is surprisingly light despite the bleak themes and black humor to all the suffering caused by an obsessed newspaper CEO and his sycophantic toadie. You hear the chaotic jazz and haunting theme crescendoing into despair as the film goes on to the bittersweet end. \n\nIn conclusion, Sweet Smell of Success has brilliant direction and gorgeous cinematography that's so creative, you'll be thinking about the crafty filmmaking as much as the stomach churning tale of woe herein.",

            "content": "Sweet Smell of Success immediately stands apart in the film noir genre thanks to quick and clever dialogue, similar to that of screwball comedies but communicating darker and more menacing ideas. The language of the characters is filled with metaphors and subtle understandings between those conversing so it wouldn't be hard to miss important comments, hidden among the fancy language, but the way the actors clearly and believably deliver their lines paired with the refreshing simplicity of the plot keep that from happening. While the plot is straightforward, the characters' inner struggles are more complex and it is through the creative dialogue that we learn not only how the characters really feel but also how they want others to think they feel. Burt Lancaster's JJ Hunsecker even says that Tony Curtis' Sidney Falco has 40 faces to conceal what he really wants and to help him get it. Falco is the opposite of what we expect from handsome, likable Curtis so from the onset, he's deceived even us but throughout the film we see him go lower and lower as he tries to reach the top. Though an unusual role for Curtis, it is one where he can really show his skills and give one of his best performances. Lancaster is cast against type as well and plays the role of manipulative columnist and frighteningly overprotective brother better than his usual buff hero. Hunsecker's sweet and fragile sister, played forlornly by Susan Harrison, and her righteous jazz musician boyfriend, played confidently by Martin Milner, are two lone points of light in the shadowy city streets of New York as all the characters around engage in immoral and selfish acts. The film depicts multiple relationships between family, friends, lovers, and enemies, all with an understanding of how they shift and change as circumstances do. Falco and Hunsecker's friendship is the most intriguing as they often seem at odds, even hostile, and business is ever their priority. Even with these tense relationships and multiple acts of violence, there is never a murder, something one would think almost essential to a film noir. However, the movie is stronger without it as we get to see the effects of each dirty decision played out on all the characters involved. It still has distinctly film noir elements including entrancing black and white cinematography and a cool jazz score.",

Cinematography, music, writing all great. Though too clever for its own good. It’s hard to follow at times. And once you’ve got whats going on straight, you realize how dated the drama is. There really was a time when calling someone a communist in print could destroy them. Fascinating study of the power of media.

With repartee ricocheting off one another, Curtis plays remora fish to Lancaster's shark, or Chester the lapdog Terrier barking at the feet of the latter's Spike the full-of-bull Bulldog. Theirs is a toxic symbiotic relationship of jealous masculinity and desire, a lacerating and acerbic embodiement of the Hegelian master-slave dialectic, with about as much chance of success—which is to say, just a whiff.",

            "content": "On a subjective level, I really liked this. On an objective level, this is pretty much a perfect movie. Ahead of its time in nearly all aspects, Sweet Smell of Success is a groundbreaking classic. It's no surprise that this bombed at the box office upon initial release; audiences weren't ready for this level of advanced storytelling.\n\nWith nearly zero violence or action, this movie manages to be engaging from beginning to end. I was glued to the screen by virtue of its snappy, razor sharp dialogue. Aside from Steve and Susan, almost every character in this piece is a scummy sleaze bag of some sort. There's so many moments of dishonesty, deceit, lying, greed, you name it. It can be pretty downbeat once you realize this is no fairy tale, but rather a non-sugarcoated commentary on the harsh reality of power-hunger and control. The seedy underbelly of journalism has never been this fascinating.\n\nIt's a relentless movie, both in its characters and lighting fast pace. Not a single shot or scene is wasted thanks to the condensed, airtight screenplay. The soundtrack needs mention too. The use of Jazz music contributes to the film's distinctive personality. The photography, fluid camera usage and lighting deserve credit as well. There isn't a single scene shot during the day, which makes sense; a world as nefarious as this should be accompanied by the darkness of night. What also needs mention is the aggressive dynamics between characters. Every argument and quarrel is executed with utter intensity.\n\nLittle details like the reactionary facial expressions and body language add to the effortlessly effective performances too. Many black & white films contained great, though admittedly theatrical, performances. While this has a modicum of that aspect, for the most part the performances are far more grounded in reality. This aspect too I found to be ahead of its time. Lancaster and Curtis burn up the screen together. Even if their characters are bad, bad people, I couldn't help but be captivated by their smooth, arrogant ways of talking and carrying themselves.\n\nAs icing on the cake, from my movie watching experience, many of the aforementioned aspects I've praised have been used in films released after this. So it's no surprise this movie's as influential as it is. Even if I wasn't emotionally involved 100% of the time due to the overflow of corrupt characters and bleak subject matter, there's really no glaring complaints I have about the film as a whole.",

Yet somehow the tone of the film and stellar performances by the actors elevates the simple story to be something better. It has a great look, and feels like it is an accurate depiction of life on the streets. The cinematography is stellar and I really feel the passion in all the lead actors. Tony Curtis is particularly slimy and unscrupulous, and even when he's in the background of a scene you can sense his feelings about what is going on. Perhaps one of the hardest scenes to watch is when he tries to act as pimp for another columnist by whoring out his girlfriend. I did struggle to enjoy Sweet Smell of Success, though, and not just because of that scene. It seemed that virtually every character was so overblown and dishonest that I really didn't like anyone in the film. It's tough to care when bad people are fighting with other bad people. However the real dilemma I had with this film is the dialogue. It was coming so rapid-fire that I struggled to follow along. Also they spoke in such elaborate prose that it was disingenuous and inauthentic. Real human beings don't speak in that kind of language, no matter what era this film took place in, and it seriously threw me off at times. I'd probably watch Sweet Smell of Success again if asked, and a second time through I might catch the rest of the dialogue I missed the first time, but it's not one that I feel any particular need to revisit despite the solid performances.",

            "content": "Rapid dialogue sets the tone for Sweet Smell of Success. Burt Lancaster produces and stars as the almighty newspaper columnist J.J. Hunsecker - a thinly veiled version of Walter Winchell. In a different time (1940s and 1950s), newspaper columnists commanded immense persuasive power, careers were built up and torn down overnight usually depending on the whims, grudges, or favors of a particular noted columnist or editor. Columnists can't be everywhere at once and they depend on a network of spies, interns, and friendly public officials to feed them information. Enter Tony Curtis' character Sidney Falco, a sleazy, neurotic, hounding press agent who is a slave to Hunsecker's will. Falco falls out of favor and will do anything to get Hunsecker's ear again; including selling his dignity, which he does over and over again. Hunsecker and Falco are positively medieval in their treatment of people's feelings even concerning members of their own family, such as Hunsecker's love-struck kid sister who has fallen for the wrong type of man (a guitar player) in Hunsecker's opinion. Hunsecker is played by Burt Lancaster, but despite Lancaster's best efforts this is Tony Curtis' film all the way. Lancaster is known for his diverse performances, but Curtis completely breaks type. Curtis shows audiences he can do more than romantic comedies. Undoubtedly a hectic film to shoot, Lancaster's firm produced the film and the cast and crew knew all too well the tyrannical nature of Lancaster as producer. Director Alexander Mackendrick pulls off a difficult script in short order with Clifford Odets re-writing almost all the dialogue and delivering it to the actors as soon as it came off the typewriter.",

The key with that film is how 100% committed writer/director Dan Gilroy is to, not only follow through with his character and his storyline to the final credits, he actually doubles-down!\n\nHere, screenwriter / original novella writer Ernest Lehman first created two of the most reprehensible, irredeemable characters in film history. They are truly awful, Godless people. Then, [SPOILER] he bizarrely decides late in the film to punish them both for their villainy. First of all, it completely undercuts everything that came before. Castrating their evil comes across as though you as a writer weren't committed to it in the first place. Second, the way it is done is confusing and clumsy. Plus, it's quick and results in an abrupt ending to the film. [END SPOILER]\n\nThis is something that separates the men from the boys when it comes to film. Being willing to go all the way with the despicable characters you've created, or throwing in the towel at the last minute. \"Sweet Smell of Success\" gives up, while \"Nightcrawler\" charges full-steam ahead!\n\nApart from that issue, the film is beautifully made, with James Wong Howe's excellent black-and-white cinematography, Elmer Bernstein's film score and Alexander Mackendrick's direction.",

Though he is completely consumed with making a buck, even at the expense of an innocent person, there's a kind of sense of redemption you want him to experience.  Alas, the angle about  Hunsecker wanting his sister to break off her relationship with jazz musician Steve Dallas (Martin Milner of Adam-12 fame) wasn't really explored too in-depth as it pertains to the origin.

            "content": "\"The cat's in the bag, and the bag's in the river.\" Fun fact, Breaking Bad borrowed that line for 2 episode titles. Damn, this was amazing. First off, it's 1950s noir, so you know it possesses a certain aura of \"cool\". And while we're on the subject, it's not your typical noir: most noir films feature a dark, violent crime. Violence is absent in this one, but it is replaced with the ruination of reputations. Second, it is very dialogue driven, with some of the best tongue-in-cheek lines you'll ever hear. I felt like I was watching the average episode of Mad Men haha. The camera is quite steady, with dozens of long takes and cool angles to set the mood. I think a big reason I love noir so much is that the characters are so overly mysterious. You can never quite tell what their true intentions are: good, bad, chaotic, neutral, foolish, conniving, or something else entirely. It adds a whole different element to how you watch and dissect the film. The script was impeccably written, using figurative language at every turn. Used today, it usually doesn't work, and movies come off as arrogant and too, idk, self-aware? (Kicking and Screaming comes to mind.) But if a film can make me smile/smirk for its entirety, that is a rare gift. If you're one of those people that doesn't like a \"talking movie\", you need to sit down and reassess your life, cuz this film was out of this world, and never a dull moment. It was my first Burt Lancaster, first Tony Curtis, and first Alexander Mackendrick. Needless to say, I've just found 2 new actors to watch for, and another director who's got the right stuff.

When the so called film buffs compile there lists of the \"best\" films and so on, this should always be talked of in the top five and yet though recognised more as the years go by this is still a highly overlooked film. That Marlon Brando, De niro, Nicholson and the like should be recognised so often in said lists when Burt Lancaster in this film and in so many others has equalled or surpassed there best performances is a real scandal. Perhaps because this film strikes at the very heart of the establishment and shows the media and press up for the unscrupulous scum they are that this is one those fellows would like to forget. It is always difficult to look the truth of oneself in the mirror and this is one mirror the media should look very closely at. A masterpiece from Lancaster, who's courage never failed when making films and was always ready to tackle the kind of film making that lesser men would not have dared to, not to mention casting himself in a \"bad guy\" role that defied his heroic, handsome leading man status. Let us not forget that this is the same man who through out his life was never afraid to speak out on subjects that were important to him, a life long liberal and contemptuous of anyone who excepted limitation.

The acting is purely unbelievable-- every single person in the cast is so well chosen, it's hard to imagine them in any other role. Curtis is fine in his first bad guy role (he was known for being good guys), and deserved the BAFTA nomination. Lancaster is one of the best villainous characters, and to think he didn't receive a nomination for his acting in any award is extremely shocking, it's one of the best performances I've ever seen.

NOT!!! \nThat misleading title was meant to be facetious, as this Movie is Dark Noir & about the seedy side of attempting to climb the Ladder to Success.Going in thinking it was gonna be a Happy Climb to the Top, is how this Film catches you by such complete Surprise & makes for a Juicy Storyline.Tony Curtis as Sleazy but Conflicted ,Sidney Falco, is asked by his boss J.J. Hunsecker(Burt Lancaster) to do many unsavory things, which seems a moral struggle for Sidney, but he throws his friends under the bus anyway, even when he cares for them.JJ.Hunsecker is a Alpha Predator with a Devil Complex, who seems to enjoy wielding an Unjust Sword  with his newspaper column, & if there is no scandal, he will create one,not caring who he ruins.The Control of others feeds him.One of his most frequent Victims of his Power &Lust for Control is his Sweet 19 yr old Sister Susan(Susan Harrison) who is in Love with a Decent, Talented Musician she wants to Marry.Hunsecker never gives the guy a Chance, he orders Sidney to ruin him, first in print, then loss of Job, then by planting Marijuana & having him arrested.This Movie is about what lengths Sidney will go to get the Ego Maniacal  J.J. Hunsecker to print his articles & get him noticed, but at what & who's expense? \nBiting Dialog, Excellent Acting, Darkly Disturbing Cinematography, & a story that seems to bear a resemblance to Walter Winchell Or Randolf Hurst make this Film itself Smell of Success.Even though it was a Box office flop at the time, it has a cult following now.Bravo & Encore, Encore",

            "content": "Disclaimer: This review is super long because I wrote it for a class.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is one thing that all men want; one thing that grips the desires of the soul and never lets go. This one thing can sink a man to his lowest depths to achieve it: success. The Sweet Smell of Success shows just how low a man will go and how good a movie about it can be.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sweet Smell of Success is the story of New York press agent Sidney Falco (Tony Curtis). Sidney is as crafty as he is charming. He woos potential clients and women alike and at first it seems that he might genuinely care for them. But it soon becomes apparent that Sidney only uses people as stepping stones on his way to the top. If they lose their purpose, they lose their time with Sidney. Sidney isn't that high on the ladder though, but he knows who is. J.J. Hunsecker (Burt Lancaster) is New York's most popular columnist and the more he mentions Sidney's clients, the better off Sidney is. J.J. understands that Sidney needs him and he knows Sidney will do anything to be on his good side. J.J. orders Sidney to break off his sister Susan's (Susan Harrison) relationship with her musician boyfriend Steve Dallas (Martin Millner). Sidney, blinded by his own ambition and his trust in J.J., is forced to do everything he can to end their engagement.\r\n\r\nI have always pictured older films as being very light-hearted affairs. They didn't deal with hard topics because it was too taboo to show difficult topics on the big screen. The Sweet Smell of Success shattered that naïve assumption. The first time the audience learns that Sidney Falco is nothing but a scumbag is when he uses a trusting girlfriend as a prostitute. The whole film is imbued with the seedier side of show business, one involving blackmail, police brutality and a vaguely incestuous relationship between J.J. and his sister.\r\n\r\nThe Sweet Smell of Success succeeds because of two important things. Firstly, the two main characters bring their A-game to the table. Tony Curtis is wonderful as Falco. This is considered his first dramatic role and Curtis brings it to life. Falco is cruel and handsome, full of guile while still leading the audience into thinking he is a good guy. Burt Lancaster is the perfect foil for Tony Curtis. Lancaster shows us the creepy dominance of J.J. Hunsecker: a man who seems to be perpetually in the dark. His tall presence controls every scene and he somehow always has a response to every quick comment out of Tony Curtis' mouth. Burt Lancaster is a fantastic villain, one the audience loves to hate. The Sweet Smell of Success is a testament to his substantial acting ability and he has been recognized as 19th in the Greatest Male Stars of all Time list.\r\n\r\nThe second thing that helps this movie succeed is its setting. New York feels alive under James Wong Howe's cinematic direction. The city is a character itself, lending its atmosphere to the mood of the movie. No scene would be as powerful without the city as a backdrop. The score as well is phenomenal. Jazzy riffs play in almost every scene, sounding like the natural noise of the city. Any score that creates atmosphere without drowning the audience is a thing to be praised.\r\n\r\nI only have one complaint. Some of the dialogue is a little taut and scripted. Natural flow between actors gets interrupted by lines that only Shakespeare could make up on the spot. For a movie as convincingly wonderful as Success, the very smart dialogue should make it even better, not worse.\r\n\r\nIn 1957, America was introduced to Hill-Hecht-Lancaster Production's latest movie The Sweet Smell of Success. Unfortunately, America didn't appreciate it at first, but saner heads prevailed and Success has enjoyed a resurgence in popularity over the years. It became so popular that it was inducted by the National Film Registry into the Library of Congress. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the movie and any student of film should put it on their must-watch list. The Sweet Smell of Success is an amazing combination of acting and atmosphere that hasn't lost a thing over the years.\r\n\r\n3 and a 1/2 out of 4 stars \r\n  \r\n-Christopher O'Connell",

The script is largely what saves the plot from being just a melodrama.

Lancaster is fantastic as he always is and Curtis succeeds in portraying a morally fickle man caught in the grips of greed. Yet, where the film falls flat for me is the lack of presence by Mackendrick. While I do admire directors who are more austere when it comes to making a film, I still want to feel their presence. There was nothing in this film that made me want to really seek out Mackendrick's other work because it seemed as though anybody could have directed the film. Maybe he trusted the acting and story so much that he felt he could just roll without putting too much focus on the style. I don't really know. In the end, It is a bleak and well acted film about the suspension of morality in pursuit of personal gain",

Perhaps paradoxically, the incredible stark black and white night scenes reminded me of nothing less than Michael Mann's recent exploration of nightscapes in glorious color and depth on the digital front.  To have this happen with a 1957 film, that is obviously drained of color and meant to be as gritty as possible, is a testament to the brilliance of the photography, restoration, and transfer.  It makes me wonder what other night time gems are out there, but simply haven't gotten the Criterion treatment.  The story has never been more relevant as well, although happily I feel that I rarely come into contact with this world.  I certainly know that the non-stop 24/7/365 gossip train exists though, and that it is picking up steam.  These characters are larger than life, especially that of Lancaster and Curtis.  The dialogue is icier and sharper than but few other films and the morals harsher and bleaker.  It seems incredible that the film ever got made, but so much of it is implied and unsaid that it just squeaks by under the radar.  Scripts like this would never have been written without the production Code, which is one of the reasons one can make an argument for it being responsible for the creation of more cinematic masterpieces than it ever prevented from coming to the screen.  This is a Manhattan I've never really known, and I've not seen portrayed comparably in too many films, but I certainly wish I would have had the chance.

They're just human enough to be believable though, that there are people out there like this.  We are scared and disgusted at the same time.  The writing here is beyond brilliant.  So many good one-liners, but it is also razor sharp and so taut it fries your nerves a little.  \nAdded to that is the atmospheric jazzy-tinged score that embellishes a lot of the time to fit the mood.  But, it's perfect in that sense because everything is a heightened, exaggerated and the music is a part of that.  The lighting is great here, too, lots of harsh lighting and dark shadows only intensify the story we have going on.  Finally, Mackendrick has such a good eye with the camera here and is creative right from the get-go; the shots we see are never boring.  It is as much his story as the actors' and the screenplay's.",

Hunsecker and Tony Curtis as a sleazy PR man named Sidney Falco who'd sell his grandmother if it would benefit him and his clients. Hunsecker is set against his sister marrying a jazz musician and Falco desperately trying to get in favor of Hunsecker, goes along to try and break up the relationship by making claims that the musician is a marijuana user.\n\n\"I'm tasting my favorite new perfume - success!\"\n\nWritten by Ernest Lehman and directed by Alexander MacKendrick, Sweet Smell Of Success is a sharp-edged cookie full of arsenic loosely based on real life newspaper man Walter Winchell. Lehman injects plenty of cynicism into the script that could be compared to anything Billy Wilder ever wrote. There isn't a likable character in the film (except for maybe Hunsecker's poor sister and her boyfriend), everyone of them are despicable. MacKendrick's tight direction is on full display as he directs both Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis to one of the best performances each had ever gave in their entire careers. Lancaster puts away his usual likable charm and plays one of his darker roles as the malevolent columnist Hunsecker and Curtis, then an actor mostly known for his looks and not his talent, shows the naysayers that he could really act here in his first real serious role as the weaselly press agent who would do anything just to have the chance of smelling that sweet smell that is success. James Wong Howe's monochrome photography is absolutely breathtaking as it, along with Elmer Bernstein's jazz score, set a dark atmospheric mood following the characters through theaters, hotels and nightclubs. It is some part the equal to Billy Wilder's \"Sunset Boulevard\" yet with it's satirical view of the media and it's box-office turn out, it can be compared more to Wilder's followup to \"Sunset Boulevard\", \"Ace In the Hole\".\n\n\"What does that mean - integrity?\"\n\nBritish filmmaker Alexander MacKendrick creates one of the greatest films of the '50s, possibly ever made. It is an absolute classic of the noir genre that has aged gracefully. This is a film for fans of classic movies. Absolutely essential viewing. 10/10\n\n\"I love this dirty town.\"",

Another standout performance is by Susan Harrison who superbly plays Hunsecker's tormented teenaged sister Susan, whom he harbors incestuous feelings for, a bristling and compelling screenplay by Clifford Odets and Ernest Lehman from the novelette by Ernest Lehman that has vivid and hard-boiled dialogue with lines like, \"i'd hate to take a bite out of you,\" Hunsecker tells Tony Curtis's poisonous press agent Sidney Falco, \"you're a cookie filled with arsenic. Soulful supporting performances by Martin Milner, Sam Levene, Barbara Nichols, Jeff Donnell, Joseph Leon and Edith Atwaier, taut direction by Alexander Mackendrick and a superb jazz score by Elmer Bernstein, exquisite black & white cinematography by James Wong Howe that perfectly captures the New York City nightlife of the late 1950s.This film has been selected for preservation by the National Film Registry and the American Film Institute has selected Burt Lancaster's character  J.J.

In fact, I doubt I've seen anything else from the 1950s that has such plainly sordid, nasty goings-on. Apparently, the main character is based on the infamous gossip columnist Walter Winchell. The story concerns an influential and unscrupulous columnist, his relationship with his equally amoral lapdog, and the way the two of them mess with several other blameless people's lives. Bruce Lancaster, who usually played heroes, is very good as the columnist, who has oddly memorable glasses. Tony Curtis is also really excellent and energetic as the desperate little lackey.

Tony Curtis is Sidney Falco, a slimey PR agent who will go to any lengths to get publicity from J.J. Hunsecker (Lancaster), the most powering newspaper columnist in New York. Hunsecker doesn't want his sister marrying a Jazz musician, and so orders Falco to break up their love affair by any means necessary. Curtis is totally convicing as the greasy slimeball press agent, who totally deserves all the bad luck he has coming his way. Indeed, Curtis's fans were initially horrified, since they were expecting him to play another nice guy role. Lancaster's possibly incestuous feelings towards his sister are never overtly stated but are implied, and whenever on screen he is a force to be reckoned with. Possibly because of such a negative reaction from the fans, Sweet Smell of Success failed at the box office, despite high critical praise. Although not as influential as other film noir like The Naked City, this film is nonetheless an important milestone, with some great dialogue to boot.",

Hunsecker (Lancaster). Alexander Mackendrick keeps the film moving at an swift pace from one scene to the next, and even though it is remembered for its extraordinarily quotable dialog (courtesy of Ernest Lehman and Clifford Odets), the film features spectacular nocturnal visuals of Manhattan, photographed by James Wong Howe. Howe captures the noir atmospherics so well that the shadows in the streets appear to be darker than the night sky, which appears as a kind of dark gray, illuminated by the lights of New York. Lancaster gives arguably the best performance of his career, imbuing Hunsecker with a strong sense of menace, and a stare that cuts through his victims like a knife. \nThe plot has Falco trying to keep an eye on Hunseckerâs younger sister, Susan (Harrison), whoâs in love with a clean-cut young jazz musician, Steve (Milner), that Hunsecker disapproves of with a vengeance. Falco will do anything to curry the favor of Hunsecker, in order to get his clientsâ names mentioned in his column and become the big-shot press agent he dreams of being. He sells his soul in the process, and is finally betrayed in the filmâs disturbing and unexpected conclusion.\nMuch of the film consists of Hunseckerâs mind games in trying to trap Steve into some situation where he can break him and tear him apart; indeed, this sums up pretty much all of Hunseckerâs interactions with the characters in the film. Emile Meyer is perfect as the slimy police officer who will plant evidence or drop charges on a whim at Hunseckerâs command. The Chico Hamilton Quinet appears as themselves, providing the intense jazz score that drives the film (along with the memorable orchestral score by Elmer Bernstein).",

Desperate to make a living, Falco reveals a dirty plan to separate weak-willed Susie from her beau. While disgusted by Falco's slimy trade, the threatening, malicious columnist is determined to keep Susie for himself, so he agrees. In this jazzily scored, seamy nocturnal world, everyone is expendable as Hunsecker pushes for his twisted desires and Falco grasps for success.

'the cat's in a bag and the bag's in the river.' the characters play incredible, cool-headed mind games with each other through a maze of brilliant dialogue. this film is the pinnacle of noir smart-talk high style. it seems to embody everything that mamet built his style around. i wish i could see this cast perform 'glengarry glen ross.' it's dark and cynical, but relishes the tone, so it's not as bleak as the period's -other- dark, cynical newspaperman movie, billy wilder's 'ace in the hole'",
