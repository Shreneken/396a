Overall, it is relatable in its basic features ( human suffering and romantic needs) but this tale, an allegorical tale, which fed easily into a certain historical context, hardly fits in today's world because of its core principles. Suffering can be endless, and so can one's capacity to fantasize. We can't trust anyone. And we can't really change our dates, in that the main character's capacity to fantasize and willingness to change is ultimately punished.. \n\n Ultimately, not a great movie for the story but for the style and the overall dramatic level. worth watching.",

            "content": "At this point I think I have to admit that I'm just a sucker for cynical, depressing storylines with strong elements of humanism. Nights of Cabiria is one of those great films about the dichotomy of life - its capability for extreme pain and simultaneous potential for happiness; this has got to be up there alongside De Sica's Umberto D. and Kurosawa's Ikiru for its powerful storylines about beaten-down characters realizing the beauty in life even in moments of tragedy. However, even compared to those masterpieces Nights of Cabiria has something of a darker tone regrding its protagonist's ultimate fate - her jubilation in the impromptu procession after her devastating betrayal can be interpreted as either a turning point for a future of greater potential, or an exasperated and drained response to an unfroeseen loss. Her representation of the cautious optimism and benevolence of the human spirit even in the face of antagonism (and as a representative of the reemerging but disenchanted postwar Italy, clarified through the context of the charitable organizations and destitution surrounding her) are potent metaphors. The film is made what it is by Masina, who delivers a powerhouse performance with her exuberance and devastation in equal measure. The final ten minutes of this film linger in the air; as the motivations of key characters are revealed to Cabiria her pain disillusionment is our own. Terribly empathetic, Fellini will manipulate your emotions as easily as lighting a cigarette with this one. (4.5/5)",

            "content": "1957's Nights of Cabiria brings back Giulietta Masina's spunky titular \"working girl\", first introduced in passing near the end of The White Sheik.  A decorated near masterpiece if not a masterpiece, this is Masina's finest hour.  Though an impossible prostitute (a word that's never used, at least according to Criterion's astute subtitles), Cabiria is tragically naive in the ways of love.  If not love, per se, then perhaps life.  Several key scenes play out before desolate postwar landscapes, the cranes of supposed progress rebuilding the city into an expansively modernist and efficiently sterile version of its former, ancient self.  Another Fellini classic, another soulless soirée.  In this film's ill-advised night out, Cabiria mambos the night away and into our hearts (not necessarily in that order) in an upscale yet skeezy night club with no shortage of ominous snake ladies at every table.  Cabiria is out of place in this place, but how could she possibly mind when she's have this much fun?\n\nBut all of that is fleeting.  Though lovelorn and terse, this is still the portrait of a woman who, nevertheless and very deep down, holds out hope for love.  Nights of Cabiria is a powerful film; a case study character study that is not without social messaging.",

Cabiria is revived by some local boys and runs off by herself, shouting. What follows is a series of similarly humiliating episodes, in which the defiantly positive prostitute Cabiria is hurt, but never broken.\n\nThis feels weird. Because life has gotten so busy, I haven't written a movie review in over a month. For the one person that might read this, I don't write these for other people - these reviews aren't polished, nor are they spell checked, obviously. I write them so I can learn more about film and think deeper about the films I watch. Anyways, I watched this weeks ago so my memory is hazy, but what an old classic this was.\n\n\"Nights of Cabiria\" was a very interesting story. It's the story about how much someone can get sucked up because of lust. How lust / love can blind one person so much and the consequences it brings. It hurts to see and it's unforgivably comical at times. It's a well written screenplay translated to a solid film. \n\nGiulietta Masina did so well as the lead. She really made this character her own. The character isn't the most likable by any means, as she really just an everyday person. But the themes present throughout the film are shown through her character ark, up until the very last scene (which was very nice by the way). \n\nThis is certainly an artsy-esk film that many people probably won't see if they're not in the film industry, but it's one that's pretty good. I'm not the most into old classics but this is a story with some really intriguing and relatable themes.",

Roger Ebert also believed she was channeling Chaplin. It all builds up to the ultimate betrayal, which can't completely destroy her character.",

            "content": "Nights of Cabiria is a tough movie to watch. It starts with the main character almost being killed, and her life doesn’t improve much from there. It seemed every time there was an opportunity for things to turn around for her, she’d get smacked back down. I struggle with films that are so opposed to their protagonist, because I have a tendency to empathize too much with their ordeal. I appreciated that she had such a positive outlook on things despite all the difficulties she faced, but it seemed to just be the strength of her character that allowed her to rebound. Since there was never a legitimate silver lining, I had trouble finding the same reasons to look on the bright side. I suppose I don’t have the same resiliency. I’m not sure if there is an arc for Cabiria in the film, it just amounts to a series of ordeals where the rug gets pulled out from under her. That being said, it is a well-told story that delivers on the theme of the undying human spirit. Giulietta Masina is superb in the lead role, and does so much emotional work with nothing more than her eyes. She totally blew me away. If this is a style of story that doesn’t faze you, then it might be the best version you could possibly find. It’s just a type of narrative that I find ridiculously hard to watch, but I will say the last few frames of the film were marvelous and did my heart good. ",

Even when she thinks her struggles are over and she has found happiness and contentment, things may not be what they seem.\n\nWonderfully engaging movie from Federico Fellini.  There's a lightness and sweetness about the main character that makes her easy to support.  Some great comedy too.  \n\nIt's not all wine-and-roses though.  There is a fair amount of struggle, bitterness and cynicism involved.  The ending is particularly cynical, possibly too cynical.  I am generally not in favour of Hollywood, happily-ever-after, endings but this story deserved a bit more happiness and closure than it ended with.\n\nWhile Fellini pulls the strings to perfection, it is the performance of Giulletta Masina as Cabiria who makes the movie.  Street-wise and sassy yet sweet and vulnerable.  Very funny, yet able to convey great sadness and struggle too.  Some of her physical comedy is Chaplinesque in its brilliance.  Her performance spans the whole gamut of human emotions and expressions and she does it incredibly well.  Incredibly engaging and it is this engagement that makes the movie so great.",

            "content": "Fellini's movies often involve innocents at cruel odds with a cynical world. In his beloved Giulietta Masina, he found a ideal human form for this theme. Petite, almost elfin, warm and spirited, she was the perfect muse for his vision as the greatness of his movies waxed in the late '50s.\n\nIn La Strada, she plays an almost impossibly innocent woman enslaved to a brutish circus performer. In Nights of Cabiria, Fellini puts her into a seemingly polar opposite. She plays Cabiria, a strong-willed, resilient prostitute, unafraid and defiantly independent. Her principle dilemma is how much of her heart she should permit to open. This is the soul of the movie, Cabiria's attempt to negotiate how much to let in and how much to seal out.\n\nShe maintains a veneer of cynicism, but still manages to open her heart, unwisely to the detestable men she meets, but also to spirituality. She puts her heart into a trip she and her prostitute friends make to a shrine to pray for grace to the Virgin Mary, and a week later realizes that she is the same old whore she was before, that she never got the grace she prayed for, and lapses into a spiteful harangue to a passing parade of nuns. \n\nLater, however, she meets a kind-hearted Catholic brother, and she allows him to reconsider the promise of the Church. She goes to the church the next day to confess her sins to him, but he is not there, and in any case, he cannot hear her confession because he is not yet ordained. Rather than confess to another priest, she tells him she will wait for his ordination. The Church would like you to think that their priests are interchangeable for the purpose of the sacraments, but she knows better. She saw a spirit in him that others lacked, and that's to whom she would open her heart.\n\nThere is one particular scene that is the most important in the movie, and appallingly, it was excluded from the film for over 40 years. One morning, trying to make her way back home after entertaining a customer, Cabiria witnesses a man silently distributing food and necessities to the poorest of the poor, people living in hollows beside the roads on the outskirts of the city. She recognizes one of the poor folk as an ex-prostitute she used to work beside, now haggard and destitute. The man goes about his charity, and gives Cabiria a lift back to the city. \n\nThe man is not in clerical garb and his function is never explained. It's just a thing he does, matter-of-factly, without reward or praise. Cabiria observes him as if he is an exotic creature. She does not understand why he does what he does, but she perceives some special kind of grace from his action.\n\nOf all the scenes in this movie, filled with prostitutes and unflattering images of the Church, the scene that the Church wanted cut from this movie was this one, because it shows a layman tending to the people that the Church should have been aiding. The scene was cut, and not restored until 1998. I suppose this scores low on the list of grievances one might have with the Catholic Church (please see my review of Spotlight), but we can recognize the Church's demand to cut this scene of quintessential human kindness as typically venal and disgraceful.",

            "content": "Nights of Cabiria (Italian: Le notti di Cabiria) Italian film, directed and written by Italian legendary director Federico Fellini. Starring Giulietta Masina (wife of Federico Fellini - considered female version of Charlie Chaplin). Film won Best Foreign Language Oscar award, and Masina won Best Actress award at Cannes Film Festival. Fellini also had directed Masina another Oscar-winner 'La Strada 1954 (The Road - Anthony Quinn). Cabiria was a small character, from another Fellini's film The White Sheik.\r\n\r\nCabiria is street-prostitute in the post-ww2 Rome - she lives in her own single-room house that she is proud of to boost in front of everybody, including her bank-account - she is often at fights with other street-prostitutes. Sentimalist as she has been all along, and inconvincible to accept betrayal in love affairs at the hands of men - having been pushed into water by her boyfriend who robbed her of 40,000 lira in her purse, only to be saved by near-by swim-expert children. Her kind-hearted, too interfering-and-yet-sweet neighbor friend Wanda (Franca Marzi) is always there to condole her, despite, often been slighted by Cabiria. \r\n\r\nJust as the case was with me, when I first watched La Strada in 2010. I sent sms to my brother in capital city, telling him, \"I just found reason to live\". Events repeated themselves, after I watched this film, and there was only single word coming out of my repeatedly \"magical\". And by God, I still cannot make up my mind as to where should I begin this review from, what am I supposed to write about legendary personalities like Fellini and Masina. \r\n\r\nYou barely, receive performances as impactful as Masina's - her smile, her making-of-innocent-facial-expressions, her delivery of dialogues, sarcastic use as well as dance-moves (like, when she does in the start of the film on the street) are enough to hypnotize you. \r\n\r\nApart from all this, we come to Fellini's perfect direction, maintaining surrealist atmosphere - and while he does this, there is no space left to suspect artificial use. Is Cabiria really Cabiria? Or a movie-character indeed? - Fellini's mastery at wiping the memory of audience of scene in the beginning, as the movie progresses until the end, makes us wonder at the level of his skill to take the full advantage, when he desires. And he perfectly executes at the climax - and what a sheer heart-piercing climax, it was no lesser than the shocking climax of La Strada.",

This film is one of Fellini's masterpieces which can be easily identified with all people whether or not they're not a prostitute or not since it centers on being in a world where they're really disgusting and heartless people who continue to bring well intentioned people down, only that they're always some hope to be found.

I think I could like his film weren't it for his neo-realistic roots (most apparent in the milieus in his films and the notorious scenes of people wandering around in bleak suburbs) and his desire to cast his wife Giulietta Masina in every other of his early films.\nCabiria like Gelsomina in La Strada is an utterly naïve girl who seeks love and luck but seems to not have the guts to actually achieve any of it.\nOf course, this is partly because of the time period the film was made in, but these whimsy and weak female characters are just killing me.\n\nWhat I most enjoyed were the scenes when the neo-realistic bleakness is exchanged with 8 1/2-esque extravaganza (most prominently in the scenes in Alberto Lazzari's house). I think this is more like Fellini's natural environment and I think his visual style suits lavish luxury more than bleak naturalism.\n\nWell, let's continue. After this scene at the film star's mansion, the story goes nowhere for a while until Cabiria meets the next man in her life (the first one, right at the beginning, throw her into a river after stealing her purse), Oscar who she madly falls in love with - and so does he, apparently. It's not that easy though because, as I already mentioned, Cabiria is a naïve, kinda dim-witted, cow.\n\nThe ending is great though, Fellini has a knack for leaving the stage with a big bloody bang and this film proves it.",

            "content": "Aside from being a masterful surrealist, it is also very notable to state that Federico Fellini is also a morally powerful and spiritually transcendent filmmaker. This is, of course, very much evident here in \"Nights of Cabiria\", an unforgettable cinematic masterpiece that traverses the widely unseen and unheard (at the time) world of prostitution and the soulful humanity that bleeds through and through albeit the blind sexuality contained within it. \n     \nAlthough it is much expected that the film shall highlight the more obscene aspect of what many consider as the 'oldest profession in the world' just like, say, Luis Bunuel's later film \"Belle de Jour\", \"Nights of Cabiria\" is surprisingly very mellow with the jobs' details and instead delves not on the inner workings of the affordable sex that they offer or on what motivates prostitutes to continue on doing what they're doing but on the reasons why they should not anymore. At the center of it all is the energetic yet at times very temperamental Cabiria (played by Giulietta Masina), a prostitute who can be the most romantically jaded one minute yet can also be the most hopelessly romantic in the next. With a face that still echoes her heartbreaking turn in Fellini's earlier film \"La Strada\", Giulietta Masina, with her sometimes tomboyish facial expressions and mime-like gestures reminiscent of silent film stars, is a beautiful embodiment of both melancholy and hope. \n     \nWith her consistently comical body language and a face that fluctuates between naughtiness and confusion, Cabiria is evidently a most complex character to pull off. But despite of that, Masina has done it as if without much effort. Yes, perhaps there are no scenes that show her participating in any simulated sexual congress. And yes, perhaps Giulietta Masina does not, in any way, physically resemble an actual prostitute, what with her small stature and relatively frail body frame. But with the help of her masterful evocation of Cabiria's romantic naivety and pure humanity, she has been most believable as one in much the same way Philip Seymour Hoffman is never a dead ringer for Truman Capote (Toby Jones relatively gets that distinction) yet he has made us believe that he actually is the \"In Cold Blood\" writer for close to 2 hours mainly because of how inspired his performance was. \n     \nBut then of course, Giulietta Masina's powerful performance wouldn't really be as penetrating if not for Nino Rota's stirring musical score, the film's often dream-like photography and Fellini's patient direction which has perfectly built-up the film until its heart-breaking yet hopeful finale. \n    \nJust like Fellini's masterpiece \"La Dolce Vita\", \"Nights of Cabiria\" is a film that's highly dependent not on how or where the so-called 'carnival of life' will bring the main characters to but how he/she may figure in the playfulness and hysteria of it all. In one of the film's most resonant sequences, Cabiria, along with her co-workers, joined a small pilgrimage heading towards the Santuario della Madonna so that they can ask her for forgiveness and guide. Albeit her countless pleads for mercy and various promises to change her way of life, Cabiria never felt any better or different, and so do her co-workers. Although a filmmaker that largely incorporates religious symbolism into his films, Fellini seems always aware that religion will always be a mere spiritual opiate and nothing more; that fate solely depends on whatever life a person leads and not on some higher power; that some music and a smile, not some wooden idols and a haplessly fevered devotion to the great unknown, can make the world of difference. With \"Nights of Cabiria\", Federico Fellini has made us all believe that despair can merely be shrugged off by a more than hopeful countenance. \n     \nFor the longest time, cinema has often made us feel the utter fruitlessness of existence and how it is almost impossible to graduate from life pristine and unscathed. \"Nights of Cabiria\", perhaps the best film ever made that deals with the emotional and moral conflict buried deep within the heart of prostitution, is a precious piece of art that genuinely captures the elusive essence of hope amidst anguish rarely seen in today's cinema.",

            "content": "For any Fellini fans, or even foreign cinema fans, \"Le Notti di Cabiria\" is a must see-- period. Cabiria (Masina) is a feisty but sweet prostitute living with her friends in the bad parts of Italy. She has many misfortunes and tragic incidents throughout her life, but never stops trying to get a better one. Fellini was not having much success with his films, though highly regarded today, they were mostly flopping. \"La Notti de Cabiria\" was an exception. It is widely considered his breakthrough movie, and it's so easy to see why. This movie is so appealing, dramatic, funny, romantic, and adventurous, and even without a plot (like most of Fellini's films) this movie still is perfect. Fellini makes the most of Italy, and gives us wonderful glimpses at the countryside, as well as some city shots, which I love. It's Masina however, that makes this movie so much fun. She was actually the director's wife, and he had already had her have parts in films like \"The White Sheik\", \"Il Bidone\", and \"La Strada\", but they were all supporting roles, except for \"La Strada\" where Anthony Quinn seems to overshadow her. This is definitely HER film. Masina has often been called the female Chaplin because of her wide use of body language and facial expressions, and I couldn't agree more with the opinion. She is absolutely magnetic as Cabiria, and you really do care about what happens to her. She's excellent in every comedic scene, and does justice to the dramatic ones, proving how much of a versatile actress she was. You can't see her in a movie and not like her. \"Le Notti di Cabiria\" is a wonderful film. Very highly recommended.",

            "content": "Why can't anybody make an optimistic movie nowadays? There are a few exceptions, as I recently saw with Stranger Than Fiction. The Larry Crowne's and Letters to God's and Blind Side's of the world just don't realize that \"hokey\" doesn't translate to its audiences; it's downright demeaning. We are treated like children and spoon-fed shallow emotions like they're peas. Momma always said you had to eat your peas, and if you don't watch movies about people rising against oppression while learning some after-school-special lessons along the way, you'll grow up thinking the world is a cruel and unforgiving place. Plus, you won't get your vitamins. Well fuck, we're just setting these people up for disaster, because someday the rude awakening will come along for everyone and they'll realize: sometimes life is shit.\n\nSo how do you find anything jovial in a world where everyone is really just looking out for themselves? You could start by watching Nights of Cabiria, which stars Giulietta Masina as Cabiria, a prostitute in the slums of Italy's scummiest streets. You wouldn't know it though: everyone dresses fashionably, listens to music, drives new cars and flirts and dances all day. Although, that's just the environment Cabiria surrounds herself in. She really lives in a small shack with a bed and some water, all she really needs to get by. She bought it for about $500, and she doesn't have much more saved up in her bank account. But Cabiria doesn't much care about her financial situation. As long as she's surrounded by her friends and a man who loves her, she's going to be OK!\n\nWell, that's the problem. Cabiria is surrounded by assholes and jealous prostitutes. She has one true friend who cares for her, but Cabiria manages to repeatedly push her away. She's convinced herself that she needs a good man to take care of her and love her. But the men she meets either rob her, abandon her or are too good for her. Hell, one of them is even imaginary. And while these men are shitting all over Cabiria and driving her towards insanity, we have the film's optimistic message in the works.\n\nWhoa, that threw you for a loop, huh? In many optimistic films, characters do overcome oppression and hardships and stuff, but rarely are they so integral to the film's final message. They're just roadblocks that lead to a grander realization that leaves all the hardships behind. And, most of the time, the hardships themselves really tell nothing about the character...other than that their lives suck, man. But in Nights of Cabiria, we're learning more and more about Cabiria as each man uses and abuses her. I don't think I'm being too revealing by just coming out and saying it: Cabiria finally realizes that the only person that can make Cabiria happy is Cabiria herself. It's not an overly complicated message or an especially remarkable revelation, but for this character, it's a matter of life or death.\n\nWe start the film with Cabiria and another man laughing and running happily in a field. While Fellini's greatest strengths as a writer make this a classic film, his best non-experimental camerawork is at hand. We watch Cabiria from afar, running in a seemingly endless, barren dirt field with nothing more than a lake to accompany it. I think it says a lot about the vast loneliness Cabiria must constantly feel, but really it just looks beautiful, revealing the Italian landscape as wide-open for possibilities and possibly cruel and unforgiving. Just when Cabiria seems to settle in with the man, he pushes her into the river and steals her purse. After she's revived by a couple of men (she can't swim), she immediately scolds them and goes searching for Giorgio, who she believes ran away to get help. She's also looking to get her purse back, which he, apparently, politely picked up for her.\n\nWell, we all know he didn't do that. And with each man, we see faults that Cabiria ignores. Alberto Lazzari, a famous actor who takes Cabiria out for a âluxuriousâ? night on the town, is too caught up in his own lifestyle to ever recognize another woman's needs, which is why he's clung himself to an equally selfish woman. The second man she encounters says the most about the woman Cabiria strives to be. With Alberto, she remained herself: she danced ridiculously at the fancy nightclub and never ate the caviar and lobster served at Alberto's home. The second man was kind, shuffling around to various homeless individuals and handing out food. She wanted to walk with him and hitch a ride, but really she just wanted to be with this man. She was intrigued by his sincerity towards others, but really she saw what she really needed: independence. Here was a man who interacted with many people everyday, content with never sticking anywhere too long or having a life partner. Cabiria selfishly wanted this man, but for reasons she wouldn't discover until later.\n\nHer third and fourth men were both named Oscar, except one of them wasn't real. Coincidentally enough, the imaginary man says the most about Cabiria because it's the first time we see her acting freely. At a magician's show, she is invited on stage and put into a trance. In one of the most beautifully heartbreaking scenes I've ever witnessed, we watch Cabiria dance and pick flowers with the never-seen Oscar, who brings forth her desires to be married. She opens herself up to this man, revealing how her hair used to be black and memories of her mother. More than anything, Cabiria wants somebody to open up to, and she believes she finds it in the real-life Oscar, who presents himself after the magician's show. Moved by her story, Oscar persists in meeting with Cabiria and forming a relationship. Cabiria is resistant, but eventually warms up to Oscar. Her friend questions Oscar's intentions, but Cabiria defends him with, âHe loves me!â? But does she love him? And eventually this question leads to: does she love herself?\n\nThat becomes the final question when Oscar reveals he only intended to marry Cabiria to steal her money. He stands behind her at the top of a cliff, ready to push her off, but is unable to do so. Cabiria's realization of the situation sends her into a hissy fit, and rightfully so. Just when she thinks she's finally found a man to shower her with love and kindness, he reveals that it's all about the money. In one full cycle, Cabiria had shifted through enough men to end up right back where she started at the beginning of the film. Oscar, who is obviously stricken with guilt as she sobs on the ground, still picks up the money and runs away. This moment, as small as it is, really shows Cabiria's biggest flaw and biggest endearment. Of course she doesn't care about money; she made that very clear. But in this scene, she outright dismisses it as nothing more than materialism, claiming that none of it mattered if she couldn't be happy. But she still hasn't addressed the fact that she's completely dependent on those around her to be happy.\n\nAt this point, the film is getting ready to end. Cabiria has been chewed up and spit out, left with no money and no home. There's only one way this film can end, right? She's standing at the top of a cliff, looking out into the world that never gives back. While she's looking beyond the horizon, let's flash back to an earlier scene: Cabiria is in a church, surrounded by hundreds of other lost souls looking for meaning and forgiveness. A crippled man prays to Madonna, asking to be healed and given a new way of life. Cabiria mimics the man, asking for some sort of guidance that will steer her life in a new direction.\n\nWe're back with Cabiria on the cliff, but she doesn't jump. She leaves and walks down a road, pouting and whimpering to herself. And then, to completely throw off the mood and melancholy orchestration, a group of locals pop out of nowhere and dance and sing alongside Cabiria. What a bunch of douchebags, right? Let Cabiria wallow in her sadness; anybody else would do the same thing. But Cabiria isn't mad, or frustrated, or anything of the sort. In fact, she starts to watch everyone. She turns her head left and right as they pass, and they come up to her and smile and offer their warmth. And Cabiria turns to the camera, looking right at you, and smiles. And suddenly you realize that all the shit wasn't for nothing. Not roadblocks, but building blocks; steps towards a life where the only person that can truly keep you happy is yourself. Alberto won't bring you out of the slums. Oscar won't make you love yourself. And God won't cure the crippled. You live with the hand you're dealt and you let it tear you apart. But you don't regret anything. You never, ever regret. You take it as it comes, and you use it. All emotions are useful, but optimism isn't an emotion. It's an idea that's fueled by hope. And while you can't always control your emotions, you can always hope for something better.\n\nRead more reviews at http://cinemabeans.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "Federico Fellini has the sky falling in \"Nights of Cabiria\", around the dreams of a singular woman with threats to drown. It's also a weird tale of caution, parts seductive and elusive, Fellini often blurring the line. Albeit, there's one drawn, and \"Nights\" checks out both sides with equal promise and specificity. There's all the allure and lush glamour you've come to expect, with the tops of a brilliant mind in a would-be sudsy world. And here's Wanda Cabiria, smoke where there's flames by the superb Giuliette Masina, a hooker played as theoretical, fighting for the right to own her shame.\n   \nOf course, it doesn't come easy when even God's against you. Cabiria has eyes on a settled life, one she recreates with faux dates and friendships with that of fellow escorts, mainly a worn chick sketched by a great Franca Marzi. The dynamics are set to tumble. \"Nights of Cabiria\" might be Fellini's picture through and through -- it's the characters making his money, and who steal the show. They die trying to erase memories of their present when it isn't breathing down their necks, and something always is. \n\nFellini late in the game pulls from his book of tricks one of the oldest and well-traversed, a steamy magic that teaches the craft of spontaneity to climb past in order to take back your life. There's always down time on Cabiria's fast track, up to her to exploit. It's the clock once again that wheezes in the darkness of Fellini's boogie nights, and who, like a gifted mistress, steps over the bar when it's low.",

Such is the case with the positively glorious and devastatingly heartrending masterpiece about the tempestuous prostitute who breaks our hearts through the unexpected love transformation and that legendary walk at the end: the stuff movies legends are made of.
