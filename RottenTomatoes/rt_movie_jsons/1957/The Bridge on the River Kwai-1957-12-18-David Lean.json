The film opens in a Japanese POW camp in 1943 and we are shown the terrible condition of the prisoners as well as the stubborn and heartless Japanese Commander, Colonel Saito.  We are introduced to the newest batch of prisoners who are to build a bridge over the River Kwai in order to connect tracks for the Japanese trains.  The first hour of the film shows several characters, all of whom are well developed and know who they are which is captured by the actors with stunning proficiency!  We see intimate details of their lives and morals as well as what they stand for and we even see the Japanese Colonel slowly becoming a more understanding person, at least compared to what he was.  In an escape attempt an American POW Shears (Played by William Holden) is able to make his way out of hostile territory and on to safe grounds, only to be sent back as a guide in order to avoid a court trial for impersonating an officer which made no difference in his treatment anyways.  You have to feel bad for the guy, but even worse are the conditions of those sick and injured who are still working on the bridge despite their conditions due to the British colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness) having gone mad and obsessing over the finishing of the bridge.  The team that is lead by Shears is ordered to go in and blow up the newly finished bridge and we are left with loads of suspense the final half hour of the film.  The term epic is rightfully used here as the film, while having detailed characters and a human condition theme, is also grand in scale and has the talent to pull it all off.  David Lean shows his genius in the Director's chair and the cinematography is beautiful (It looks absolutely stunning on the new 4k transfer on blu-ray) and all the actors do a terrific job in breathing life into their own characters.  This is a Classic film and deserves the rank of #36 on AFI's Top 100 Films of All Time, Highly Recommended!",

Based on the novel by Pierre Boulle, it is about the British POWs who were forced to build a railway bridge across the river Kwai for their Japanese captors in occupied Burma (now Myanmar), not knowing that the allied forces are planning a daring commando raid through the jungle to destroy it. Even if the plot is entirely fictional and the Thailand-Burma Railway bridge was never destroyed, this story asks hard questions based on the principles of honesty against matters of loyalty and treason. Alec Guiness delivered a great career-defining work with his performance of a an ambitious man obsessed with showing what a British soldier is capable of. The climax is one of the most thrilling and well-told finales in the history of cinema and it makes you think about the moral dilemma of the whole situation and how pointless everything was.",

            "content": "David Lean's \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\" is an ambitious, gripping and sweeping historical epic that upholds its status as one of the greatest war movies ever made. With his fourth feature, legendary director David Lean crafted an awe-inspiring war drama that offered a fresh interpretation of Pierre Boulle's book. Using captivating cinematography, Lean draws viewers into the world of authoritative British military officers that construct a bridge for the Japanese forces. From intimate close-ups to extraordinary establishing shots, the cinematography keeps viewers engrossed in the film's wartime setting. Lean showcases immense control of craftsmanship over the production design, locations, and musical score, using these elements to craft an unforgettable cinematic experience. Michael Wilson's screenplay is also superb, and expertly uses minimal dialogue to evoke the tensions between the British and Japanese armies. It is hard to not praise the timeless performances from the cast. Alec Guinness delivers one of the finset performances of his career as Lieutenant Colonel Nicholson. With riveting expressions, he conveys the angst, determination and rebellious streak of an Allied commander whose pride turns out to be his worst enemy. William Holden is remarkable in the role of a commander that is trapped in a situation beyond his control. Holden conveys the moral dilemmas experienced by soldiers in one of his finest roles. The final, most unforgettable standout in the cast is Jack Hawkins. As an intimidating army officer, he brings an air of menace to the movie. Although \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\" is undeniably an unforgettable war drama, ultimately it is not a flawless film. At close to three hours, it suffers from a lengthy running-time that tests the viewer's patience. The first hour that focuses on establishing the historical context through exposition isn't quite as engaging as the climax of the second-half. Nonetheless, fans of historical dramas will definitely enjoy \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\" and so will movie-goers seeking old-fashioned entertainment. At a time when WWII epics are rarely made in Hollywood, it's reassuring to be reminded of the magic of the genre by one of the world's greatest filmmakers.",

I also thought the movie has a few very impressive performances from the main cast. In addition to these strengths, my favorite aspect of the movie is that it isn't afraid to make the audience truly think about right versus wrong. The movie's moral ambiguity is what really drew me to it. This is an older movie that is definitely paced like one, and can feel pretty long at times.

The titular bridge, based on the Burma Railway in Southeast Asia, stands as the movie's and book's symbol for the rise of communism. Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) manipulates American and British soldiers to work and they will die like \"coolies\" than \"heroes,\" similar to the propaganda used by Communist officials to force the working class to use means of production to structure their socialist revolution. Nicholson (Alec Guinness) rises against the Japanese colonel's totalitarian dictatorship, due to his strict military views, and gets punished and rehabilitated for his resentment. The similar instance happens in another story where a man disagrees with the laws of a socialist leadership and gets jailed for it, George Orwell's 1984. Shears (William Holden) escapes the POW camp and vows to destroy the bridge. Similarly, Americans in the 1950's have a strained relationship with Communism, with the Red and Lavender Scares and the blacklisting of Hollywood actors and screenwriters. In fact, the writers for Bridge were exiled in England and were accused of supporting Communism; therefore, their names were discredited. When Nicholson discovers Shears's plan to blow the railway, he realizes his mistake, gets shot, falls into the plunger, and the bridge explodes. This superb climatic high note showcases the true anarchic effect of communist rule and the British and American rebellion against the proletariat.\n\n(4 1\u20442 Hawk Kites out of 5)",

Other Oscars were awarded for Best Director, Best Lead Actor, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Adopted Screenplay and Best Original Music Score.\n\nThis movie has everything a great motion picture should.  From a visual perspective, the cinematography more than deserved the Oscar award.  It is visually stunning as it captures both the wild and the beauty of the region (The story takes place in Burma, but was filmed in Sri Lanka).  The camera takes full advantage of every vantage point there is to use, from aerial views to underwater and everywhere in between.   Composer Malcolm Arnold uses a score that continually builds from beginning to end, but then will disappear completely letting the natural sounds of the jungle and the water take center stage.  One particular standout scene where this is employed was when the covert team of commandos slowly, slowly moves up the river in complete silence, pushing a small camouflaged float containing an explosive.  The entire film is simply magnificent.  \n\nAlec Guiness (Best Lead Actor) is fantastic as Col. Nicholson, a British military leader who finds himself and his entire troop being held as Prisoners of War under the Japanese commandant Col. Saito.  Saito is portrayed to incompetent perfection by Sessue Hayakawa.  Hayakawa was the one Oscar nomination (Best Supporting Male Actor) that did not win\u2026 but he was certainly worthy of it.   Col. Saito, under the rules of the Geneva Convention, utilizes this camp of POW's as labor to build a railway bridge he is under pressure from his superior to complete.  As this is playing out, the British Military has finagled United States military man Major Shears (William Holden) to join them as they attempt to infiltrate this POW area and destroy the bridge being developed.  Shears is a reluctant participant, but a necessary one for Britain, because he had escaped from this same POW camp sometime earlier. \n\nLike Braveheart, another film I recently watched, this movie contains portrayals of several real-life people, but the story itself is completely manufactured in order to tell a great story\u2026 not history.  And the story is one that juxtaposes the military commitment and duty of three very different people with their very different moral compasses.  In the end, it all turns out to be \"Madness!   Madness!\"",

It's one thing for a war movie to glorify historical events, but it's quite another for this film to pretend it's based on a true story when everything is complete fiction other than that there was a bridge built by British soldiers. It portrays the Japanese as inept and the British as masters of efficiency. That's how people wanted to view things in 1957, but it is totally inaccurate, and very insulting. It's an entertaining film, but it certainly does not deserve to be #13 on the list of greatest movies ever.

David Lean's impeccable attention to detail in the stories and visual compositions of his films proves him to be a director with a fine legacy behind him and River Kwai is no exception. Alec Guinness empowers Colonel Nicholson with a sense of dignity and pride that few actors are able to portray with such ease. The film's true power is in the immense moral complexity of its story. Whether it is Warden's desire to die like a gentleman vs. Shear's longing to \"live like a human being\", Colonel Nicholson's rules of soldier-hood vs. Colonel Saito's, or Major Hugh's plan to blow up the bridge vs. Nicholson's determination to build it, there aren't any straight paths to moral fulfillment . Lean is also able to keep the film from being as black and white as many war films are in depicting who is the good and who is the bad. He instead focuses on the fact that war is, as major Clipton put it so elegantly, \"Madness.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014-Overall: River Kwai is a finely made film with a committed cast and impressive visuals that is all guided by David Leans masterful hand and mind. it's a truly great among war films. it's a Jolley good show! \u2014\u2014\u2014- Highlight: The scene of the solders whistling the iconic Colonel Bogey March is one of stunning simplicity in its statement of endurance through adversity.",

William Holden is also terrific and their is impressive list of extras. Holden maybe cynical and he is the one understand more so the madness and glory of war more than anyone. Its a powerful told story about patriotism and doing ones duty. A battle of wits between to the two Colonels. Colonel Nicolson playing by the book, the rules and keeping his men's morals high as they work on the bridge. But the end suggests he may have lost touch which the war and world they are living in. The destruction of the bridge was a necessity. The film looks very impressive with the amazing backdrop of landscapes and jungle. Many wide and  panning shots creating gorgeous cinematography and elevating much of the tension to come. The little sound effects of the jungle heighten the senses that we are there. The film is at times intense and last 20 minutes keeps you on the edge of your seat. The contrast with the sound of the men having a entertaining evening with the camera panning down the river as the men use their raft towards the bridge is very effective. The film starts as we see many graves and two men are burying another man its their job. We are straight away thrown in and understand the nature. Colonel Saito and Colonel Nicholson many exchanges are well written and acted. With Nicholson not budging from his position. Its very dramatic, somber at times and very moving. Nicholson belief in the power of the British Army as they make the bridge hinders his perception of what the real aim is. Honour will become his downfall.  The whistling Army as they walk over the bridge could have so many meanings. Its one scene that will live long with me. The men's morale is at a high with tendencies to suggest the British are still in control. Rightly considered a masterpiece and well deserving of the best picture Oscar.

            "content": "One of numerous critically acclaimed David Lean epics, The Bridge On The River Kwai still holds up today as a story about soldiery and perseverance in the face of brutality and the ever-looming possibility of death. It's a film largely remembered for Sir Alec Guinness' award-winning lead role, and it's not difficult to see why. He is the personification of military elitism, sticking to the book and refusing to yield, no matter what he's being put through. He wants his men to build a bridge to spite his enemies, but realises all too late that he has played right into their hands, and it's his own ego and self-aggrandisement that has led him to that point. The film is grand in scope and scale, as you'd imagine from a Lean production. Even the smallest moments and emotions are made to feel huge. The film does occasionally sag from its excessive length and sometimes languid pacing. I found myself much more invested in the soldier's quest to build a bridge than I did in the allies' scheme to blow it up. Also, I found the last few minutes to be a bit unusual, as if the filmmakers themselves didn't quite know how to end it. But the ending is as iconic as the movie itself, and is essentially the entire story in a nutshell. It's a classic for a reason, and if you can stand it's 161-minute runtime, then it's an experience you won't soon forget.",

Tricky waters to navigate, since we feel a mix of enthusiasm and reluctance for both perspectives. Everyone has a distinct, relatable motivation - even the seemingly-merciless captors - which makes this something much more than your usual yay-rah, blow 'em up wartime picture.

It did make me think a lot about the life of a prisoner of war and what their different circumstances were like. I feel that this fits into the war drama genre in that it\u00e2(TM)s a bit more straightforward than other war-related films. It gets to the point, and there really aren\u00e2(TM)t any subplots to move the story through. I don\u00e2(TM)t wish that the film had done anything differently, as I feel that it works for what it is \u00e2\" it just wasn\u00e2(TM)t my cup of tea. In regard to the writing in the film, I appreciated the confrontation between Shears and Lieutenant Joyce about the feud between Lieutenant Joyce and Colonel Nicholson. When Shears argues that their feud is ridiculous and states, \u00e2the important thing is how to live like a human being\u00e2?, it presents a very wonderful meta moment in the film to provide commentary on the disagreement between the two men, as well as to provide support for Lieutenant Joyce and encourage him to move onward. With the directing in the film, my favorite scene was when Shears and the nurse are making out on the beach. Shears moves to get handsy with her and she moves his arm away. It shows a lot about who she is as a character and what she will and won\u00e2(TM)t put up with. It was a great and direct deliberate movement. An editing sequence that I appreciated was in the beginning when the men are whistling as they\u00e2(TM)re marching and it cuts between different men, their facial expressions, and their feet. When we see their feet, their shoes are falling apart and, in some instances, barely hanging onto and protecting them. It shows what terrible condition the men were in. I loved the character of Lieutenant Miura because he\u00e2(TM)s so intense. When someone comes to let him know someone was shot, he bangs a stick on a desk repeatedly to stop him from talking. In regard to the cinematography, I enjoyed the scene when the packages are being dropped from the planes in the wee hours of the morning. It is a great set-up to the next moment when the music bursts into triumphant horns and a man watches the men land with their parachutes. The sound design was probably my favorite part of this film. I appreciated that the true ambient noises were always prevalent. When the prisoners of war stand in front of the man who captured them, you could hear katydids or crickets in the background.",

Saito insists that Nicholson order his men to build a bridge over the river Kwai, which will be used to transport Japanese munitions. Nicholson refuses, despite all the various \"persuasive\" devices at Saito's disposal. Finally, Nicholson agrees, not so much to cooperate with his captor as to provide a morale-boosting project for the military engineers under his command. The colonel will prove that, by building a better bridge than Saito's men could build, the British soldier is a superior being even when under the thumb of the enemy. As the bridge goes up, Nicholson becomes obsessed with completing it to perfection, eventually losing sight of the fact that it will benefit the Japanese. Meanwhile, American POW Shears (William Holden), having escaped from the camp, agrees to save himself from a court martial by leading a group of British soldiers back to the camp to destroy Nicholson's bridge. Upon his return, Shears realizes that Nicholson's mania to complete his project has driven him mad. Filmed in Ceylon, Bridge on the River Kwai won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director for the legendary British filmmaker David Lean, and Best Actor for Guinness. It also won Best Screenplay for Pierre Boulle, the author of the novel on which the film was based, even though the actual writers were blacklisted writers Carl Foreman and Michael Wilson, who were given their Oscars under the table.",

We follow the engaging Alec Guinness as he masterfully and stubbornly manipulates and debates with a Japanese Colonel, while another man escapes their prison camp to only return to blow up the bridge the British POW's forced to construct. We witness the mental fortitude and destruction of each man in the story.\n\nLean's direction for The Bridge on the River Kwai is so captivating with his far wide shots sweeping panning shots that you are fascinating and held in suspense for the majority of the film's duration. The problem I have is that this is sometimes an unbearably slow film with a massive running time. It could have been cut down to the most priority shots to tell this same story. It is slowly building to its fantastic finale, but I have a hard time remaining entranced by the entire film's sequencing. Lean could have cut this epic down to its most integral scenes. Overall, Lean's direction is mind blowing, but the snail pacing holds The Bridge on the River Kwai back.\n\nAlec Guinness is masterful as the crazy and strict Col. Nicholson. His portrayal of a British officer is rigid with responsibility, brave in his stubborn devotion to duty, and mad in his focus on the building of a British made bridge on the river Kwai. Guinness convinces you as a man of the law, rule bound by his nature, to the point of insanity. You empathize with his perspective, but feel he falls too far, or perhaps, he falls just in the right way.\n\nWilliam Holden is the war weary POW that escapes the Japanese camp only to be coerced back to blow up the bridge Guinness is administrating over. Holden is hilarious as the grief stricken and lackadaisical coward that must overcome his grievances to achieve a higher purpose. Indeed, The Bridge on the River Kwai is all about what our place is in the world and how we must cope with our lot.\n\nFinally, the Japanese actor Sessue Hayakawa is phenomenal as the near dictator of the prison camp Col. Saito. He depicts the cruel sadism of a negligent and violent overseer with the thoughtful worry of a man nearing the order from his country's leader to kill himself.\n\nIn short, The Bridge on the River Kwai is one of cinema's greatest war films. It can be dull at times, but the greatness arrives in the gripping performances.",

Saito is completely outclassed throughout the entire movie, and he knows it.

Now of course, the British man did many misdeeds of their own, so this could be a kind of cultural hypocrisy, as is the defense of enemy assets during wartime, but while the former may have good and bad qualities, \"going native\" in war is generally considered to be a great debasement of honor, no matter what culture you are from. The Colonel was a very interesting character, and this film would be a good watch just for the philosophies behind each character's actions. Alec Guinness steals the show, no question, and the cinematography is wonderful for its time. This is a great movie, even if it has shortcomings. I could go on for ages about the implications behind it, but I think this will do.",

            "content": "This film successfully applies the five elements of an outstanding picture:\n1. Concept/Setting\nThe film explores two central ethical questions: (a) Do certain scenarios (such as being a prisoner of war) permit one to compromise one's principles (such as those outlined in the Geneva convention)? (b) Where, and in what priority do your loyalties lie when in a scenario such as Colonel Nicholson (do they lie first with your men, your country, your captor, or yourself?)? These questions are explored in the setting of a POW camp, and are physically represented by the bridge itself. This is a good concept.\n2. Plot/Progression\nThe movie answers the above questions in a chronological (and logical) order. Each important character is devoted the necessary time to develop their required background/theme; no time is wasted on unimportant characters. This is a good progression. \n3. Writing\nThe explored questions are explicitly brought to the screen by the characters. However, the viewer does not feel like the character is educating the audience; rather the characters seem to raise these questions BECAUSE it is what the character cares about. Furthermore, important philosophical beliefs of the characters are expressed succinctly in short but content-rich lines. This is good writing.\n4. Acting\nThe actors don't look like actors. Since each character plays a part in the ethical questions raised by the film, the viewer does not need to pay as much attention to the skills of the actor as they must pay to the role of the character. Alec Guinness is perfect for this type of acting. This is good acting.\n5. Power\nThe film ends on a tragic note. Throughout the film, Colonel Nicholson has been unafraid to present his solution to the two ethical questions {(a) and (b)} raised in the film. However, the tragic and perhaps unexpected ending brings Colonel Nicholson's solutions into doubt; the viewer thought or felt that a concrete answer was going to be given, but the opposite occurred. This allows the film to be watched multiple times. This is power.\nIn conclusion, five elements equals five stars.",

Alec Guinness does something in The Bridge on the River Kwai that I never expected and it simply amazed me. His character takes such an interesting arc throughout the film, and our opinion of him shifts along with that arc. I was fascinated with how dramatically my emotions about one man could vary so dramatically over the course of a few hours. I, personally, feel the shortcoming of this film is the fact that we leave the POW camp for way too long about two-thirds of the way through the movie. The prisoners and the bridge was the story I was invested in, that was the plot I wanted to see in center focus most of the time. Leaving the camp for a couple brief scenes to setup the ending would have worked, but they completely shift the entire film and try to establish a whole new cast of characters, meanwhile I'm waiting to get back to the guys I cared about. It's not enough to ruin the movie, and knowing the team of commandos adds some extra emotion to the climax, I just didn't know if it was necessary. However, even with some small aspects that discouraged me, The Bridge on the River Kwai is an amazing movie and I can see why it has been highly regarded for so long.",

Instead of tanks, air raids and gun battles, this film focuses on the Prisoner of War camps where soldiers were forced into labor and unjust punishment.  I loved the content of the film but 2 hours and 40 minutes was way too long to tell this story.  Everything develops so slowly that it becomes difficult to stay focused.  It is celebrated as one of the greatest films of all time but I can't find any reason that this film should have beat \"Twelve Angry Men\" for the Best Picture and Best Director Oscars.  I don't even think that it is as good as \"Witness for the Prosecution,\" another Best Picture nominee from 1957.  Still, Alec Guinness puts on an Oscar-winning performance and several of the film's iconic scenes have etched their imprint onto cinema history.  I feel nostalgic during the \"Colonel Bogey March\" sequence, the hot box scene is very raw, and the \"What have I done?\" concluding scene is excellent.  Even though this movie came out 20 years before \"Star Wars,\" it is hard to watch Guinness without thinking about Obi-Wan Kenobi the entire time.  Ironically, I believe his Oscar-nominated \"Star Wars\" performance to be better than his performance in this film.  I would even go as far to say that Charles Laughton, Henry Fonda, and Lee J. Cobb were all more deserving of the 1957 Oscar.  The acting in this film is good but the scenery, cinematography, and screenplay are what you will remember.  \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\" is a significant part of cinema history but its legacy is tainted by several other films of its era that contain superior acting and dialogue.",

Guinness stars as a British general at a Japanese POW camp who becomes obsessed with constructing a bridge for his captors, as the allies plot to destroy the very same bridge. I've seen the film twice now, and I'm still not sure if Guinness is a hero or a fool. A must-see. Directed by David Lean.",

I liked how all the British prisoners were charmingly stubborn, and they even made the enemy somewhat sympathetic which doesn't happen very often in old war films. \n\nUnfortunately, I didn't like this as a war film. I watch movies like this for many of the reasons religious people watch religious movies. They watch them to be inspired, and to see an example of a truly pious and virtuous man. The type of man all religious people wish they could be but very few are. A role modal that is \"close to God.\" Typically, they also get examples of how to be a proper sinner and shameful. Both archetypes act as guides for the viewers own journey of self-discovery, self-improvement and self-empowerment. \n\nThe most meaningful reason I watch war movies is to be inspired. To see an example of a man with a strong character, strong principles, and is virtuous and dignified in times of war. Most men in old war movies are presented as so heroic and courageous; it's something I can never fully be, but something I can always strive for. It teaches you how to be a \"real man,\" a term that's a misnomer because all men are real, but when I see old war movies calling them real men because of their nobility just seems right. It's more a badge of honor than a literal definition.\n\nMy problem with The Bridge On The River Kwai is the men are honorable in a very pro-British way, but in times of war the rules of life change and so should attitudes. Many events and ideas in the film contradict everything I've learn from other war movies. I can respect the men, but not as men in a war. If this was anything but a war movie I would have more appreciation for the movies British-centric sensibilities. I'm still giving the movie 5 stars, though. If it was intended to be a training video for real soldiers I'd give it a thumbs down.",
