    "summary": "During World War I, commanding officer General Broulard (Adolphe Menjou) orders his subordinate, General Mireau (George Macready), to attack a German trench position, offering a promotion as an incentive. Though the mission is foolhardy to the point of suicide, Mireau commands his own subordinate, Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas), to plan the attack. When it ends in disaster, General Mireau demands the court-martial of three random soldiers in order to save face.",

            "content": "No war makes for better anti-war movies than World War I, not even Vietnam. Instead of the meat-grinder, disregard for human life showcased on the German side in the phenomenal 2022 version of All Quiet on the Western Front, Stanley Kubrick takes us to the French side, where a company neglects suicidal orders to advance on a German position after watching the company before them get completely annihilated. Our hero, Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas), fails in his attempts to rally his company and a falling soldier knocks him unconscious. All of this death and destruction was so one man could receive a promotion. Although the orders to bomb their own men as a sort of crop whip are not carried out, three soldiers, one from each disobedient company, are to be selected to be court-martialed for cowardice \u2014 the first two allotments of 100 and then a dozen are whittled down to just three (Joe Turkel, Timothy Carey, Wayne Morris), which makes it a more intimate story. The bloodbath here is in the military tribunal courtroom \u2014 obscenely located in a baroque chateau \u2014 where a kafkaesque farce of justice takes place. The men are to be made examples of, despite Colonel Dax's best efforts at defending them \u2014 he was a lawyer during peacetime. Colonel Dax wages a futile campaign against the Generals (Adolphe Menjou & George Macready) who are representative of the insane military system itself. The best visuals come from Dax marching through the trenches flanked by his men and the execution by firing squad, which includes shooting an incapacitated man (Turkel) in yet one more moment of absurdism. The final scene concerning the French jackals goading the German woman forced to sing (Susanne Christian, who will later become Kubrick's wife), only to be placated once she hits the middle of the folk song, portrays a humanity still wedged within the soldiers yearning to break free. But what Colonel Dax does after he returns to his chambers is up for interpretation: Will he continue to defy orders in the name of sanity or has he become one more cog in the machine? This is a short, but powerful anti-war movie that is often overlooked and buried in Kubrick's unequaled filmography.",

The cast is superb across the board, with the late, great Kirk Douglas delivering an outstanding lead performance as Col. Dax, a true hero trying to save the lives of innocent soldiers despite the bureaucracy surrounding them.  The character is a rarity among Kubrick films, who rarely had real heroes in his films.  Behind the camera, Stanley Kubrick brilliantly adapts the novel in to a stark anti-war picture, showing how officers who never see the dangers of combat can call enlisted men cowards who must face it.  Its brutal and unrelenting, standing as one of the best anti-war films ever.  A true classic.",

Although I am not directly familiar with Kubrick's work, a shameful admission I know. Out of what I have seen so far I loved Dr Strangelove and despite only seeing it once while flicking through channels liked The Shining too. Anyway back on target, Paths of Glory was brilliant in my opinion!\n\nWinston Churchill famously claimed that it was this movie that was closest to evoking the atmosphere of WW1 and the military mind. And you know what, he is right. For one thing, Paths of Glory is gorgeously filmed, with relentlessly beautiful cinematography and nice costumes and scenery. The screenplay is sometimes humorous, sometimes moving and sometimes even haunting, either way it was some fine writing. The efficiency of Kubrick's direction is proof of a great man at work.\n\nThe performances were superb. As the general who orders the hopeless attack on the German position, Adolphe Menjou's character is perceived as a villain not because of being an officer adhering to the letter, but that he is seen as \"the arrogant aristocrat\" because of his fear of the working classes than his hatred of the enemy. Among the cast, Timothy Carey and Kirk Douglas especially were outstanding. And the music? That is one rousing score I can tell you. Great movie. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

The scenes are so realistic, especially if you watched Peter Jackson's World War 1 documentary \"They Shall Not Grow Old\". Great cinematography, art direction, acting, screenplay, and, above all, message.

The frustrated general finds three scapegoat soldiers to court-martial, and though they are represented by an officer who is a real lawyer, he is helpless to save them.\n\nWe see the emotional damage the incompetent general has put others through-not for the glory of France, but for his own purposes.

Kubrick made the film relatively early in his career and elements of Paths of Glory foreshadow his status as one of cinema's great auteurs.

            "content": "Throughout the history of cinema, the great majority of war films, regardless whether or not they are about the Great War or are themselves great films, and not withstanding the intentions of their makers, one way or another end up glorifying war. Narrative structure inevitably dictates that the audience identifies with and roots for one side, while history ineluctably demands that combatants be divided into good guys and bad guys, victors and losers. A director like Spielberg\u2014who once said that \"every war movie, good or bad, is an anti-war movie\"\u2014may set out to make a movie that shows the bloody brutality of battle in vivid, nauseating detail, manifesting the old saw that \"war is hell,\" yet all the while aestheticizing the heroic drive to strife. On the one hand, with ever increasing and more graphic accuracy, the actual conflict is shown to be unthinkably horrific, with the often deliberate effect, on the other hand, of making soldiers appear all the more valiant and justified in fighting.\n\nIf there are any exceptions to this general trend, Kubrick's PATHS OF GLORY stands apart as the most, if not the only, fervently anti-war film in the annals of cinema (with the director's own FULL METAL JACKET among the few similar, albeit less successful, attempts). Whereas other more standard portrays of WWI, such as the recent 1917, depict in graphic detail of nightmarish landscape of the trenches and absolute desolation of the conflict in objective terms while maintaining the courageous character of its combatants, only Kubrick's ironically titled film is brave enough to show that not only are all wars hell, but unequivocally so are the martial machinery that wages them. War, in the abstract and in general, is not the enemy no more than the (completely absent and so only imagined) Germans are; rather, it is the generals, regardless which side they fight for, and the politicians, regardless whose flags they wave, those running the armies and treating war in the abstract, who are the true enemy of all soldiers alike.\n\nLimiting the action scenes to only a few minutes within the first act and underscoring them with no triumphant musical swells, Kubrick refuses to glorify war by suggesting that combat and courage are synonymous. By focusing instead on a group of blameless though otherwise unremarkable soldiers refusing to fight for either country or themselves, the film takes aim at the institution of the military, revealing how its corruption and its cowardice are as inherent as they are abhorrent. Even Douglas, in a performance as explosive as artillery, is only a hero insofar as he refuses the traditional conventions of macho heroism, only a good man insofar as he is a bad soldier, questioning orders in lieu of giving them. Such a negative, disparaging look at patriotism and the institutions of the state, of course, led to the film being banned in France (and elsewhere in Europe, in deference to the French) for almost twenty years; perhaps that is why Truffaut claimed that \"there's no such thing as an anti-war film\"\u2014he had been denied the chance to see the one and only.",

            "content": "I was actually dreading watching this, I thought oh no another overly long and boring war movie featuring outdated acting. What a pleasant surprise it was then to find that Paths of Glory was just under a 100 minutes in running time, was very engrossing and contained a stellar Kirk Douglas performance in the leading role. I would say that this is Kubrick's first truly great film, Fear and Desire (1953), Killer's Kiss (1955) and The Killing (1956) all featured incredible cinematography but their storylines lacked real tension and conflict and all of that visual beauty was wasted on films of very little substance. Here the wrongs of war are grappled with as Kubrick finds the humor and the horror in the seemingly pointless World War I.\n\nThe film concerns the conflict between General Paul Mireau, George Macready, who hopes to carry out a dangerous mission simply to elevate his status and Colonel Dax, Kirk Douglas, who genuinely cares for the men he commands and hopes to defend against charges of cowardice. Mireau forces Dax to send his men out to capture an anthill with very little support, a near impossible task, when men refuse to fight having seen the casualty rate Dax sides with them but the humiliated Mireau orders the men dead. Three men from different companies are selected to go on trial and although Dax defends them well the trial is set against them and they are ultimately executed. In order to get some form of revenge however Dax orders the cowardly Lieutenant Roget, Paul Morris, to execute them. General Georges Broulard, Adolphe Menjou, unexpectedly offers Dax, Mireau's job as he announces Mireau is under investigation. Dax rebukes him on moral grounds and is saddened when he witnesses his men celebrating after being told they will have to return to the front line.\n\nThe battle sequence in this film or rather the annihilation of the French by the Germans was one of the most stunning I had ever seen on film. Everybody always talks about the opening 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan (1998) and I highly suspect Paths of Glory significantly influenced that film but here I found it even more impressive that with the lesser technology of 1957 Kubrick was able to create an atmosphere so visceral. Men get shot and roll down into puddles of muddy water all around Dax as he maneuvers his way through the battle field, pistol in hand. We understand, if we didn't already, how hopeless their mission is in this grand scene as it sweeps across the length and breadth of the land that these miserable men are fighting over.\n\nAnother incredible scene in the film, there are so many, is that in which we see the men lined up in the trench move to make way for Dax as he witnesses the forlorn, resigned expressions on their faces. Although it probably wasn't one long uncut shot it looked that way on screen and the uninterrupted capturing of the utter despondency of these men is more powerful than any monologue about the horrors of war or any gruesome death scene.\n\nThe unjustness of the executions makes your blood boil as you see three innocent men who have each valiantly served their country murdered because of the pride of one man, Mireau. The execution scene was harrowing as was it horrifying hearing Broulard announce that \"There are few things more fundamentally stimulating than watching another man die.\" His sentiments appear to proven as the other soldiers can be seen excitedly celebrating after the executions and the sickening dehumanization of people through the war is the best point that the film makes. Yes Dax is a little too ideal and gallant to really exist but Douglas's approach to the role adds much needed texture and nuance that wouldn't have been present without this fine actor and the film as a whole would not work if we did not have a sympathetic protagonist.\n\nThis is definitely a film that must be watched not just because it's \u00e2~important', which it really is, but because it's beautifully made and easy to connect without dumbing down it's message. Even children, especially children could understand that what happens on-screen is wrong and yet the film is sophisticated enough to confound even adult audiences, what a masterpiece.",

The audience witnesses the front of trench warfare during World War I recreated in all its noisy terror. The fear that soldiers faced during the constant hail of bullets of mortar fire is on full display. After the initial conflict, Paths of Glory transitions seamlessly into a court room drama. With excellently detailed and imaginative writing, national legality, military loyalty, and human ethics are explored in earnest during Paths of Glory. I found it to be one of Kubrick's most emotional films. It is quite moving.\n\nKirk Douglas leads this varied cast of war torn soldiers and pompous generals. Douglas is emotive while still conveying the air of quiet confidence synonymous with a French Colonel. He delivers multiple passionate monologues and wins you over to the side of the soldiers. The injustice carried out during WWI by France's military leaders is truly shocking and genuinely disturbing. Whether apathy or arrogance is the root cause of these corrupt injustices, it is up to you to decide.\n\nIn short, Paths of Glory is a brisk and brief film, well crafted by Kubrick's sharp eye for framing. The long panning shots and beautiful sets with their intricate costumes will delight the eye, but the realistic and emotional acting will hold your interest. I found the pacing to be a bit of a slow burn, although it pays off with searing political commentary. Paths of Glory is underappreciated among Kubrick's filmography as it aptly demonstrates bravery under fire.",

There's a clear statement made about the kind of atrocities that war brings out within the military (on their own people.) It's a tough movie to take because you can almost see what's coming from the very first scene. But despite all the warning signs, it's like a snowball that has grown too big for anyone to stop. The impressive thing about the script and acting is that it never seems like someone is behaving abnormally, even the most \"villainous\" character is acting out of ambition for a promotion. \n\nI loved the courtroom scene, and I actually wish it was a bigger part of the film. When Kirk Douglas gets indignant it captivated me more than anything else in Paths of Glory. I wish he had more opportunities to rant, because I loved it. George Macready was my other favorite actor in the film, playing Douglas' superior. His passion feels authentic, and it drives most of the events of the film. There were a number of other actors who look familiar, but I didn't recognize any of their names in the credits. Whoever they were, they all felt like real soldiers who were worn down by battle. \n\nPaths of Glory is short, and doesn't have a lot of side plots or heavy character development. It's not a flaw, it makes the story simple and straightforward, but I feel like I could have used a little more to it. Apologies for the spoilers, but I think my biggest struggle with the plot was that it ended in such a depressing fashion. If there was one ray of hope that I could have clung to that would have been different, but it was all frustration and disappointment. But, frankly, that just means that Paths of Glory was effective at telling the story it wanted to tell. It is a powerful movie, and even if it's not one of my all-time favorites, I'm glad I've seen it.",

            "content": "Even the most fervent foreign policy hawks would likely have a hard time disputing the anti-war message in Stanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory. The 1957 film, which really signaled the director's arrival on the big stage, preaches without seeming too preachy, and horrifies while avoiding some potentially horrifying imagery. What's frightening about Paths of Glory isn't the amount of blood shed, but rather the attitudes and actions of the powerful few who get a little too much enjoyment and pride out of playing God with the men ranked below them. It's an upstairs-downstairs story in so many ways, but one with higher stakes than you can imagine, and it's filmed and crafted in a way that only a master director could do.\n\nWhen General Paul Mireau (George Macready) is told by his superiors that he and his men could win the war for France by taking control of Ant Hill, he's skeptical. It's an impossible task, but one he-a proud military man-could never back down from. So he tells his best colonel, Dax (Kirk Douglas), to prepare his already worn-down men for one last fight. Dax knows it's folly, but he's also proud and quite aware that refusal isn't an option. So just days after the order comes through, the battle begins-and it's a slaughter. Some of Dax's men never even make it out of the trenches, and of those that do, at least half are dead in minutes. Eventually, the survivors all retreat, and though they've fought gallantly for France in the past, they're all called cowards by Mireau and the other generals. Someone needs to pay for the disgrace, so they choose three men to face official charges on the matter. The penalty if they're found guilty: Death. So Dax prepares a defense while the three soldiers grapple with their seemingly inescapable fate.\n\nIt's hard to say what's more compelling here: The war scenes or the courtroom battle. For the first half of the film, you're totally taken by Kubrick's filmmaking abilities. His long takes through the trenches are now legendary, and the way he stages the actual fighting is way ahead-of-its-time. Once the film shifts gears to the court, it becomes more about the story. There's a ton of suspense, as you wonder whether Dax can actually succeed in freeing these men, and as his plight becomes less and less hopeful, you'll start to shake with anger at the audacity of some of the people in this film. Make no mistake: Paths of Glory is a message movie, and Kubrick wants to make sure you hear him loud and clear, no matter how difficult his thesis might be to swallow.\n\nThe film is no less impressive to look at as it shifts from the frontline to the jury box. The trial takes place in this sickeningly large and grandiose room that perfectly underscores the idea that those in charge are completely out of touch with reality. The head generals sit off to the side, above everyone, and rather than serve as witnesses, they sip cognac and chomp cigars. Dax paces the room, as angry as we are, while the defendants sit quietly as their unjustly judged. The whole thing is a marvel of pacing, blocking, set design, and camerawork.\n\nKirk Douglas is tremendous as the only sane and reasonable man of power in France. Dax is a heroic military figure, but a little deeper than most cinematic interpretations of this familiar archetype. His weariness to fight is apparent, despite being more than able to thrive on the battlefield. There's also a naivete that's not obvious at first, but comes up much later at a crucial moment. Shocked at the callousness of one of his superiors, he's forced to make a choice that more or less punctuates Kubrick's message. It's fantastic work, and I don't think the film would be the same without it.\n\nAlso exceptional is George Macready whose Mireau is a real bastard. The entire ensemble works; really, everything in the film works. Some will tell you the final scene is out of place, but I disagree completely. It's a fitting way to end a pretty brutal movie. Would if I could find some fault, but Paths of Glory is a gorgeous war film with a clear message, great acting, and real emotional heft. You can't ask for much more than that.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/paths-of-glory-review/",

It also switches between grubby WWI trenches where soldiers get shell-shocked and the posh Versailles-like palace where the generals talk.  The plot takes the form of a classic morality play (and could have been scripted for the stage, except for the graphic realism on the battlefield) but, unlike in those works that feature heavy moral choices that create extreme tension, the right way to act is clear here.  The generals are wrong in their decisions to:  a) order the regiment to leave the trenches to try to take an impossible-to-take German position; b) hold a court-martial to try three \"randomly selected\" men for cowardice in the face of the enemy; c) offer no mercy when the pre-ordained verdict is death.  Kirk is both the commanding officer immediately beneath the most unfair general and the self-appointed defense attorney for the men.  He fights in vain against a wayward and biased system that shines a light on just how absurd and brutal warfare is (especially in that it allows some to pursue selfish aggrandizement at the expense of others).  One could argue that the absurdity has even been magnified and increased in these days of drone-attacks and high-tech combat.  Bottom line:  war is sickening.",

Now I know better. \nThe film is beautifully shot with the battlefield scenes being a particular highlight, only a true artist of film could've made a film that holds up so well. Not to mention the dialogue itself is masterfully done and executed extremely well by the cast including veteran actors such as Kirk Douglas, George Macready and Adolphe Menjou. I wont say the film doesn't have it's issues, because there are some minor ones, but not something that would ruin the experience or the film itself. I will only say that at the beginning I had a bit of a problem with the French being portrayed by Americans with an American accent, but the story, the performance and the pace of the film have completely immersed me in the film, that it was almost unnoticeable by the tenth minute mark.\nIt's a thought-provoking anti-war film as it should be. It shows the disgustingness of war with brutal honesty, where foot soldiers aren't really being thought of or even treated as human beings, but rather being treated as a simple expendable number.

Most admirable among its heady ideas is the complete contempt it has for empty constructs of \"honorable\" masculinity, drawing attention to the ridiculous idea of the \"strong father figure\" who lectures and discipline the poor, childlike underlings who supposedly don't know better, this idea the basis for most of the conservative ideology that is still spewed on broadcast news stations to this day.\n\nKubrick may have been an enigma of a human being, but his films make clear his penchant for progressive thinking and for holding up flawed power structures for ridicule; his anti-war sentiments are boldly on display here. As a piece of his larger filmography, \"Glory\" is a initial burst of creative and intellectual power that signaled his greatness, and in regarding his work as a whole, it absolutely stands among the best films he ever made.",

Though not Kubrick in his prime, it's the first movie to reveal the director's true colors, blessed with a cool, intellectual thrill, spare economical characterization and precise tracking shots.

            "content": "I've realized that after watching one Stanley Kubrick film, you never know what you are getting into. After heavily despising 2001: Space Boredom That Absolutely Makes No Sense Even With Common Knowledge of Space Travel, I needed to watch a Kubrick film that was actually worth the hype. Paths of Glory ended up being my second experience from this acclaimed but controversial filmmaker. Released originally in 1957, this anti-war drama was Kubrick's first major film that gained him national attention, particularly his unique cinematic approach to the story. First thing I have to say regarding Paths of Glory... it's loads, loads better than 2001.\n\nBased on a novel by Humphrey Cobb (apparently Kubrick liked to adapt little-known books, wonder if the 2001 novel made actual sense) and set during WWI in 1916 throughout the French trenches, Col. Dax (Kirk Douglas) is sent to lead his troops to victory, but when the mission is a major failure, the ambitious but cruel General Mireau (George Macready) arrests three of the privates, have them court-martialed for cowardice, and sentenced for execution. Dax does everything in his path to prevent such cruelty.\n\nKubrick's known for his controversial material, and Paths of Glory is no exception. Upon original release, the film was criticized by many army professionals, particularly those living in Europe, for the depiction of the cruel military officials. Whether the story was true or not, oddly enough, I think Kubrick actually mastered what he was trying to tell. This is an anti-war film, for crying out loud! Though I'm not against the military (especially the many that risk their lives each day to protect freedom), the events depicted in this film is just downright cruel. Seriously, if you hate Patton for the things he did, then this will certainly change some perspectives. At least Patton didn't go as far as execute his men for cowardice after a failed mission. While I'm not a huge fan of the war genre, especially those on the anti-side cause they always feel sympathetic in their message (though I was able to like All Quiet on the Western Front), the brooding, haunting, b&w look Kubrick sets feels totally different from your typical war picture. Feels more like a history lesson than it did anti-war, but that's just my two cents. \n\nFrom the opening scenes, Paths of Glory sets the standard for an unforgettable, powerful experience that was severely lacking in 2001. The cinematic shots of people walking in the trenches were groundbreaking for its time (and still impresses greatly to this day), the failed mission scene was about as complex as much of the war scenes in All Quiet on the Western Front, the buildup to the execution sends utter shivers in what's going on, and the finale, featuring a captured female German forced to sing to rowdy French troops, leaves the biggest impression long after finishing the film. Also impressive is Kirk Douglas' powerhouse performance as Col. Dax. Many critics have referred to this role as the role that defined his career, and while my experience with the actor is extremely limited (other than this, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and The Bad and the Beautiful), I think the critics may be right.\n\nSo for now, my experience with Stanley Kubrick has been mixed. 2001 was an utter waste of time, but thankfully, my experience with Paths of Glory makes up for it big time. The story is profound and powerful, the message is haunting and frightening, the pacing is done in a very brisk manner to where I'm sold, and Kirk Douglas nails his challenging role. After watching Paths of Glory, I now realize the greatness of Kubrick as a filmmaker, and hopefully, I'll have the same success with his other films.\n\n\"I apologize... for not being entirely honest with you. I apologize for not revealing my true feelings. I apologize, sir, for not telling you sooner that you're a degenerate, sadistic old man. And you can go to hell before I apologize to you now or ever again!\"",

In any conventional war movie, in a film made by 99 directors out of 100, there would be an 11th-hour reprieve, the condemned men would be spared, and the stupid and treacherous Mireau would be publicly humiliated. Not here. Kubrick finds a way to draw all his story threads tight without compromising his harsh and unforgiving theme. The plot is resolved, yes, but cruelty and duplicity survive, and private soldiers are still meaningless pawns. Broulard believes the executions will be \"a perfect tonic\" for the army: \"One way to maintain discipline is to shoot a man now and then.\" Kubrick and his cinematographer, George Krause, use sharp and deep focus for every shot. There is not a single shot composed only for beauty; the movie's visual style is to look, and look hard. Kirk Douglas, a star whose intelligence and ambition sometimes pulled him away from the comfortable path mapped by the system, contains most of the emotion of his character. When he is angry, we know it, but he stays just within the edge of going too far. He remains an officer. He does his duty. He finds a way to define his duty more deeply than his superiors would have wished, but in a way, they cannot condemn.",

The film boasts impressive performance, especially from Kirk Douglas. This is a classic antiwar picture, one that showcases Kubrick's directorial style perfectly, and he directs a simple, yet very effective story, which in turn just adds more depth to the tone of the film. Stanley Kubrick was a great filmmaker, and with Paths of Glory he delivers a classic that works very well because the story is simple, but it discusses an important issue, and that's usually what makes for a truly memorable and engrossing film to watch. Paths of Glory is a must watch for Kubrick fans, especially genre fans, and this is well paced affair, that is never dull, tedious or too long. The Length of the film is just right, and like I said, the film evokes important issues, and is a powerful film going experience, one that only Stanley Kubrick could have delivered, and this is a fine film that would show hints of what was to follow in his later work. Kubrick always made films that stood out cause of their subjects, and his work pushed boundaries and with Paths of Glory, this is a film that is significant in its message, and it's a film that you soon won't forget because not only is the story very good, but the acting is exceptional as well. Paths of Glory is a near perfect affair that ranks among the directors finest works.",

The movie does have so fine performances and features some stunning cinematography, but it's greatest weakness is undoubtedly the script. It's a bit too heavy handed for its own good and the narrative follows a rather conventional  depiction of moral outrage and condemnation that allot of other sub-par anti-war films spoon feed the audience. I'm aware allot of people hold this film up as a masterpiece, but as a devout Kubrick fan, the film left me feeling underwhelmed. It's not quite as polished as the directors other filmography (particularly everything from Dr. Stangelove to Full Metal Jacket); and the script is much more conventional and less compelling than Kubrick's better films. Overall it's a good movie, but I wouldn't support the consensus that this film is a  masterpiece.  It doesn't even hold a candle to Kubrick's best war film, Full Metal Jacket.",

            "content": "Review In A Nutshell:\n\nPowerful drama comes from those that expose the fragility and sadness of the human condition. Stanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory shows humanity at its worst and at its best, and through this conflicting perspective comes tension that shakes every nerve that runs through one's spine.\n\nPaths of Glory is arguably Kubrick's most dramatic film, resorting to stories and characters that are familiar and unambiguous. The acts as a terrifying portrait of humanity, of how selfless and evil one becomes the higher they stand within the rankings; the film may explore this through a military perspective, but it is the same in any situation, when individuals who are viewing their employees from such a height, cannot possibly show empathy or sympathy for their fear and desires; they simply are seen as dispensable machines in order to take credit for their brilliant leadership. It is only when one stands along with these humans at the lowest point of the earth, fighting and working with them, do we understand what it means to be loyal and the true value of human life. It is Colonel Dax who takes charge and represent these men, fighting for what is deserving and protect them from the tyranny of those above him; but sadly one can only do so much without jeopardising one's own life, making Dax come off as a real human being rather than a symbol.\n\nThe film's first half plays out more like a traditional war film, but going through it feels more thoughtful due to the early establishment of the film's message and themes, making the audience constantly contemplate about the situation and the characters themselves. Paths of Glory features one of the most glorious action sequences, a wave of soldiers pushing through no-man's land and captured so with long takes and a large scope of field. A much more intimate moment is captured that produces a similar outstanding effect, and that was during Dax's long walk through the trenches before the upcoming charge, a final look at his fine men before they become slaughtered or destroyed by the enemy's gunfire and explosives. Never at a point does the film give us a glimpse of the Germans, as a reference to their antagonistic position, as Kubrick wants to constantly remind us of the true enemy that sent these soldiers to their death, their superior officers.\n\nThe second half of the film shifts into a courtroom drama that demonstrates the element of corruption that runs through the military system and the veins of its leading officers. A sense of justice cannot be gained and it is all the more frightening because Kubrick never gives us an indication that it could be changed; it seems corruption and greed will always be present when one reaches higher and further away from the labouring soldiers. It was during this side of the film, where we see murder at its worst, led by the hands of those that they once considered were brothers or fathers. The image of the execution was soul-crushing, aching me in areas where the bullets have penetrated them; there was simply nothing we could do but stand there and watch.\n\nGerald Fried returns again to collaborate with Kubrick in creating a musical score that is both ironic and sorrowful. We constantly hear throughout the sounds of the beating drum, a supposed symbol of patriotism and justice, but instead what is felt is a feeling of sorrow and grief, like watching a funeral, seeing the casket slowly descend to the bottom of the hole. Fried's music allowed Georg Krause's photography to seem direr, feeling the darkness behind the dominating grey. Has there been anything this painfully beautiful.\n\nI have not seen many of Kirk Douglas films, especially the notable ones like \"Ace in the Hole\" and \"The Bad and The Beautiful\", but I don't need to see them to know that Paths of Glory is the actor's strongest film. The performance he brings is deep and affecting, displaying a man who is at his most desperate to find justice, attempting to shine a light on their hypocrisy, in such a corrupt and greedy system. It is deeply moving from start to finish.\n\nPaths of Glory leaves a large mark to those who watch it, forever feeling the anguish of the unjustified deceased and of those who have witnessed it. This film marks as the true starting point of Kubrick's masterful craftsmanship.",

            "content": "One of Stanley Kubrick's earlier films and probably his most straightforward film as well. When the ambitious, but heartless French General Mireau (George Macready) learns that he's being considered for a promotion, he's easily persuaded by the General Staff to order one of his regiments lead by, Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) on a suicide mission to take the German stronghold Anthill. Just as predicted the attack fails, but to save face, General Mireau blames the whole regiment of cowardice and orders Colonel Dax to pick three men who are to be tried and executed in accordance with French military law an action which doesn't sit to well with Colonel Dax who decides to use his experience as a criminal defense-lawyer to defend the three men.\r\n\r\nThe statement this film makes is certainly one that is uncomfortable to the French army, but it's a universal statement that could apply to any army and any war where leaders are willing to sacrifice human lives for a star on their uniform or for the chance of being considered heroes to their country. There are no scenes in the film depicting the bond between the soldiers this is really not that type of film, instead it's a very grim anti-war film that doesn't focus on the fighting, but more on the reasoning and moral among high-ranking leaders, which in this film leads to grave injustice. Shooting the film in black and white was a brilliant choice since it helps the grim and gloomy tone of the film and very few actors could pull of the frustrated, but duty-bound Colonel Dax as well as Kirk Douglas does. The final praise I have to give is for the beautiful ending, an ending which makes the most powerful statement in the entire movie.",

So I decided to take it off the shelf for a second viewing, and was just fascinated by the utterly absurdist nature of the picture. Kubrick depicts with audacious dialogue and camerawork, one of the most intriguing and impressive absurdist stories I have ever read or seen. The film begins by showing Gen. Mireau discussing with his superior officer the sheer futility of trying to take Ant Hill, and this sets the stage for the absurdity of the whole film; everyone in the French Army knows that this effort will end in innumerable deaths, and will probably accomplish nothing, yet Mireau still commands the troops to take Ant Hill. And after that, Kubrick begins to show us the brutal dehumanizing face of war, and probably better than he ever has before. He shows us this by way of horrific battle scenes, and by the ridiculously absurd court case that shows remnants of Camus' The Stranger. The courtroom drama in the second act is probably the most powerful part of this picture, Kubrick emphasizes the total lack of concern that the army has for personal experience, emotions, and the instinct to survive, basically human nature in general. But I haven't even mentioned the outstanding performance that Kirk Douglas gives as the thoroughly human Colonel Dax, it is probably my favorite performance of his actually. This is one of Kubrick's 2 or 3 greatest films, and one that laid the foundation for his later masterwork, Full Metal Jacket. Every Kubrick fan and film buff should see this picture.",

            "content": "A devastatingly indictment of war, not just in its physical brutality but also in its creation of the monster of man or perhaps its manipulation of the evil side of each man, Stanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory is grand.  Although after seeing his later Full Metal Jacket, this film made me feel like I was one of the three French soldiers who were put on the posts in a firing squad and executed for supposed cowardice.  Both movies did, in my opinion, address the dehumanization of the man, especially Full Metal Jacket in its first half, I think that Paths of Glory addressed more of the absurdity of warfare, and the more deplorable aspects of our being such as, plainly, murder and vanity.  Some of the statements said in the movie were so bitingly uttered with such a casual nonchalance that it was as if the death of man was a necessity of war, even the deaths of men fighting on both sides, as examples for the other soldiers to commit more murder against their fellow man.  I was astounded by the French officers' statements and I almost thought that Kubrick was trying to make some black humor but this movie definitely isn't like Dr. Strangelove in that regard.  Thinking over the last scene, of the German girl being made to sing for the French soldiers, you can feel the pulse of the men, their human needs, and their more baser side of their natures.  Men are animals, and their cries for amusement and sexual gratification are palpable, although the capacity for violence that men possess far overshadows this, as seen earlier in the film.  Yet, I think, Kubrick doesn't want the audience to be let down, to honestly believe that men or humanity aren't completely possessed of evil, or despicable deeds or thoughts.  This feeling is echoed by the French soldiers' humming to the tune of the German girl's singing, and Colonel Dax's shifting image of his realization that they need time to feel human, to feel emotions, in spite of the fact that they must advance to the front in so short of time.  Kubrick's film, Paths of Glory, is definitively anti war, but it is not anti human, even though some of the characters may seem so incapable of doing things such as not giving the accused in a court marshal a fair hearing, creating a kangaroo court of sorts, and ultimately damning the accused, who are entirely not guilty.  Colonel Dax, as the voice of the better nature of humanity, the logical, reasonable, and the sentimental mind, reminds the judges of the court marshall that if they provide the accused with the verdict of guilty, they will be haunted by these deaths for the rest of their lives.  At the same time, I think Kubrick was talking to us, the audience.  If you forget that humanity is human, that they have two sides, both capable of good and evil, and that war has, is, and will be the destruction and annihilation of the human species, then you will never feel at peace, secure.",

            "content": "Some Flops Need to Be Made  \r\n\r\nThe more I learn about World War I, the more incredibly infuriating I find it.  I do not believe war is never necessary, though I do believe it to be a sign that either diplomacy has failed or that diplomacy is impossible for one reason or another.  (Irreconcilable policies or one country or both being run by crazy people.)  With World War I, however, I think it was more a sign that no one actually tried.  Worse still, the troops were led by men who didn't seem to have the slightest interest in learning what all those dandy new weapons they were using actually did to change what war was like.  I mean, they were still using cavalry at the time, despite the fact that cavalry and machine guns do not go together terribly well.  Airplanes were introduced, and no one really considered what aerial combat would look like.  Pilots were actually reduced to chucking bricks at one another at first, and the idea to bring up pistols was their own.\r\n\r\nIt is a few years into the war, and the stalemate seems pretty well eternal.  The French military has come up with some maneuver that's going to start pushing the Germans back--they will take Beehive Hill.  Doubtless honeycombed by trenches and loaded with German soldiers.  At any rate, General Paul Mireau (George Macready) has the full support of his own superior, General George Broulard (Adolphe Menjou), and he orders the attack.  The commander on the field is Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas).  He goes along with it, because that's a soldier's duty.  However, German resistance is more forceful than the French command thinks it will be, because of course it is, and Dax and his men barely make it out of the trenches.  Mireau decides that the failure of the charge must be the fault of the men, not the fault of the plan.  Especially because they barely even make it out of the trench!  So, naturally, some of the men of the troops must be executed for cowardice, to make an example to the others.\r\n\r\nWe are basically presented with three different types of leaders.  Colonel Dax is actually a good officer.  He cares about his men; his concern with the folly of the plan is not just that he will be along there with them.  He also really, seriously wants as many of them to survive as possible.  On the other hand, there is General Mireau.  When he decides that the troops are not advancing enough, he decides that it is up to him to force them out of their trenches.  He orders an artillery barrage on his own trenches--after all, if they are being attacked by artillery, they're going to have to move, right?  And then, there is calm, mellow General Broulard.  He's most interested in what will win the war, and while that's fair for a general, he doesn't much care who he has to sacrifice along the way, and that's more problematic.  He goes along with that trial, after all, and even just basically leaves the whole thing in Mireau's hands.\r\n\r\nObviously, the French government was not so fond of this film as critics through the years have been.  The film was not technically banned, but pressure was put on United Artists not to submit the film to the censors, and without that, it didn't get a French distribution.  The Franco government banned it as being anti-war, anti-military, and probably anti-authoritarian as well.  It is, however, pleasing that despite the mild subterfuge Stanley Kubrick used to dodge the studio's possible demand for a happy ending, the studio didn't demand one upon seeing the finished film.  Roger used to quote Truffaut as saying that it was impossible to make a true anti-war film, as film makes war look to exciting.  I don't know that this really refutes Truffaut, however, as the problem with this film is not war in general but poor leadership in particular.  With Colonel Dax still in charge, would such utterly ridiculous plans be made?  Since he tries to get Mireau to call off the attack, we can reasonably assume not.\r\n\r\nThere are, I think, three classic Kubrick war films, each at a slightly different time in his career.  Each is also really an anti-war film in one sense or another.  This one is about the dreadful fate that can await men under the command of fools.  [i]Dr. Strangelove[/i], I think, posits that, when you get right down to it, they're all fools when it comes to war.  And [i]Full Metal Jacket[/i] shows the toll war inflicts even on those men who manage to survive it.  I have been saying lately that a faked Moon landing directed by Stanley Kubrick would be very different compared to the Moon landing we actually got, and it occurs to me now that the faked landing would probably not have anything to do with the military.  Most of the astronauts, after all, were test pilots, and while I do not believe Kubrick would have let any women in, either, I believe that he would have had more of a civilian presence.  If for no other reason than that he doesn't seem to have trusted the military very much.",

A great anti-war war film set during the First World War and is a bit like a cross between \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" and \"Breaker Morant\". Adapted from Humphrey Cobb's novel of the same name which in turn was loosely based on a true event, Kubrick turns his cynical eye on the absurdity of war and human nature, although I think he was still an idealist underneath at this point and you can see him sympathising with Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas). The film's plot revolves around Colonel Dax, a lawyer in his civilian life, who volunteers to defend a group of four French soldiers who are being court martialed as an example because their divison of the army where either unable or unwilling to complete a suicide mission aimed at capturing the German occupied anthill. (During the mission, the General who prosecutes them also gave an order for the French artillery to shell this same division on his own side for refusing orders, an order which itself was refused). Dax tries to exonerate the four soldiers but it is a kangaroo court and he is not allowed to bring any evidence to support them such as their previous exemplary record of bravery and character witnesses. Also his citing the conditions in which the Men found themselves during the battle, including the fact that one of the Men was rendered unconscious and another was left alone with only one other soldier, are ignored. A thought provoking film. Nothing shows the futility and absurdity of war more clearly than the events of the First World War. A brilliant film.",
