Lamont finds Regan under the psychiatric care of Dr. Tuskin (Louise Fletcher). By hypnotizing the girl, he is able to learn that Merrin previously exorcised the same demon from a boy in Africa. Hoping for answers, Lamont travels to Africa in search of the youth.",

I do give this film some credit at least for actually having some good cinematography and also matching the tone and atmosphere of the first film pretty well. Despite that, however, this film is just a complete mess and a terrible sequel to one of the greatest horror films ever made which had actual horror themes and a strong narrative. I also don't get this film's random obsession with Locusts. This sequel is just bad.",

The sound effects in this movie really angered me on numerous occasions to the point where I actually almost stop watching this garbage all together.

In that sense, the film also lives up to its own central theme: \"Does great goodness bring upon itself great evil?\"\u2014well, if by \"evil\" we mean the same sort of zealous rage from furious fanboys who felt betrayed by some of the Star Wars sequels, then perhaps Pauline Kael was right to criticize how Friedkin's film appeals to misogyny by exploiting and terrorizing a little girl.",

            "content": "Contrary to popular opinion, I found this to be a fine film.  It's no masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, but it's engaging and grandiose with its questions and ideas.  \n\nSome of the devices in the film are more preposterous than others, synchronized hypnotism or whatever it's called, for example, is something that has never existed and continues not to exist half a century later, and something which I am confident enough to go on the public record saying will never exist, but something that was pawned off on an audience as quasi plausible.  I'd actually be more inclined to believe in demonic possession than synchronized hypnotism, but the psychiatrist is portrayed as the sensible one and the priest who is chasing demons is the nut.  Go figure.  I'm not a fan of downgrading the demon from Satan himself to Pazuzu.  When I first saw the film as a kid, I laughed and laughed and laughed.  Pazuzu, how ridiculous, I'd thought.  Turns out he is a real demon in Mesopotamian lore.  He's still not the devil, however.  Downgrading from Satan to Pazuzu is like going from a Ferrari to a Kia.\n\nThe film falls apart to some extent in the third act.  I feel as if some key scenes were left on the cutting room floor in the interest of freeing up some time, an unfortunate reality of filmmaking in general.  If the writer hadn't at least written a couple scenes explaining the motivations behind the choices of the psychiatrist and Regan's aunt at the end of the film, he must have been a drunken mess trying to hurry the end along, because none of their behaviors which contradict their behavior in the first two thirds of the film are explained at all.\n\nThe performances were fine, particularly Burton's performance as the foolhearted priest who is ready to take up arms against the lord of darkness...or Pazuzu, whatever challenge comes his way.  Blair's acting is pretty mechanical, but she was 17 or 18 at the time, so it's excusable.  \n\nOn the positive side, which in my opinion consists of most of the aspects of this movie despite what the first two thirds of this review might suggest, the composition of most of these shots is appealing to me, some great NY locations, haunting locusts (minus the Pazuzu locust), interesting African locales. The pacing is pretty tight, not too fast, not too slow, and some of the ideas presented as it pertains to the very nature of good and evil and the associated not so subtle locust metaphors are interesting and far more clever than something I'd expect to see in such a detested film.   This movie is not the turd on a plate that I was led to believe I could expect to be served.  And honestly, that may be the second nicest thing anyone's ever said about this movie, however, the nicest thing ever said about the film was this:\n\n\"The picture asks: Does great goodness bring upon itself great evil? This goes back to the Book of Job; it's God testing the good. In this sense, Regan (Linda Blair) is a modern-day saint \u2014 like Ingrid Bergman in Europa '51, and in a way, like Charlie in Mean Streets. I like the first Exorcist, because of the Catholic guilt I have, and because it scared the hell out of me; but The Heretic surpasses it. Maybe Boorman failed to execute the material, but the movie still deserved better than it got.\"  The man who said that is some guy named Martin Scorcesse.",

I, honestly, have no idea what the plot is about apart from that. It's a very Incomprehensible movie which makes no sense whatsoever. The first 20 minutes were quite okay, actually, but the rest is just confusing and nonsensical. I cannot believe how they thought this was a good idea for a sequel. It's a completely dull, lifeless and boring movie which made me want to turn it off and just go to sleep. The effects aren't good, either. There's this locust that constantly appears in the movie and it's not even actually in the scene, it's a green screen locust that is put over some footage and it looks very ridiculous and bad. Not to mention the fact that this movie has almost more dream sequences than the real ones. To make it even worse, this movie is painful to even watch! The direction isn't bad, but our characters use this machine to connect their minds together (I have no idea if this is even possible), and this machine keeps flashing lights and it made me look away from the screen because of how bright it was and annoying. Not even the acting is any good. Richard Burton as the main priest character was awful. I've not seen his other movies, but here he is hilariously bad. There isn't even an exorcism in this movie, unless you count the ending one which I wouldn't really clasify as one. The soundtrack is good, at least. Which I didn't even doubt it would be since I saw it was composed by Ennio Morricone. All in all, there isn't really much to say about this movie except that it makes no sense and it's scary how dull and boring it is. I really would recommend skipping this sequel as the third one has no connection to this one whatsoever, but feels more like a sequel to the first one. Don't watch The Heretic.",

However, I tried to re-watch this film with a open mind, especially since it was directed by John Boorman, who is a director I highly respect and who's made some true film classics (\"Excalibur,\" \"Point Blank,\" \"Hope and Glory,\" \"Deliverance,\" \"Hell in the Pacific,\" etc.). Even when Boorman goes off-the-rails with a film (\"Zardoz\") or even bland (\"Where the Heart Is\") it's still an interesting and worthwhile film. While this Exorcist sequel does not deliver the same kind of scares and or claustrophobic oppressive sense of dread that the first film so effectively did, it does have some striking visuals (photographed by William A. Fraker) and a terrific score by Ennio Morricone. Boorman said he was attracted to the project with the idea of of making a metaphysical thriller. He did do that, but that aspect of the film, at best, fell flat with dull stretches of priest Richard Burton going into the mind of still possessed Linda Blair (now possessed by an African demon), but at worst the film becomes simply ridiculous (i.e. Burton and Blair braving swarms of locust during her exorcism, endless hypnosis scenes with flashing lights that are supposed to be scary, and not to mentions Blair's sudden lack of acting skills, though maybe it was the scripts fault). However, this film does have it's defenders, such as Pauline Kael and Martin Scorsese, who both preferred this film to the original.Overall, this film features a classy behind the scenes crew and a highly respected cast (Louise Fletcher, Paul Henreid in his final film role, James Earl Jones, Ned Beatty, and Max von Sydow as Father Merrin, though only shown in newly filmed flashbacks [oh, Dana Plato apparently had an unmilled part]), but the overall film is not very good, but I would say it is worth watching for fans of John Boorman, mostly for some interesting visuals, but not for much else outside of ironic so-bad-it's-good enjoyment.",

Even all the biblical references would work if they didn't show up so randomly. And they really messed up by having a different actress play the role of young Regan and not having Linda Blair in demon make-up. That alone could have been a selling point. They didn't even have to be gross with it. Exorcist II fails because in no way does it resemble the first film. The whole thing is a mess. But I do think it was smart to try something new.

However, unlike Excalibur where the bizarre and primativistic behavior of Merlin truly helped sell the work here it is shoehorned in and placed in center stage, no matter how little sense it makes. I mean, there was nothing wrong with the idea of tracing the roots of the demon back into Africa but once you get there there's no room for Regan's story. Instead of acknowledging that and telling a different story (perhaps focusing on Von Sydow again who looks very convincing in younger makeup) they shoehorn her in at every point and the plot quickly becomes incomprehensible. Why is Azuzu (the demon apparently) connected to locusts? How is it still tied to Regan? And what in the hell is James Earl Jones doing in here?\n\nBut just on the most basic level the movie loses all claims to credibility about twenty minutes in when Regan's psychiatrist hooks her up to a telepathy machine that lets them share each others' dreams.

The first signpost of malaise and ineptitude in the pitiful 'Exorcist II: The Heretic' is the superimposition of a possessed South American girl in flames and it is unintentionally laughable. Then the drivel shifts to Regan (Linda Blair) who has blossomed into a buxom ing\u00e9nue off- Broadway and it's queasy to view Blair in the sexy prima donna context. Denials from the Catholic Church are commonplace nowadays so the fact that the Cardinal reevaluates his position on Satan as a corporeal entity is fathomable. The sleepy tone extends to the clash between modern hypnotherapy and devout piety. The \"synchronizer\" sequence is an incomprehensible jumble of nonsensical rhetoric, hammy, trance-like reaction shots from Richard Burton and Louise Fletcher and an excruciating recreation of Merrin's battle with Pazuzu. A biblical swarm of locusts in Africa and Regan's psychic abilities suborn more narrative incongruity than unnerving terror. Retconning Regan with an ESP slant is arbitrary and monumentally doltish (ex. Her conversation with Sandra, a stuttering autistic patient, is the height of hilarity). A Jesuit priest plummeting from a Cliffside is such flagrant wirework that he seems to be sailing on a hang glider. Most of the dawdling scenes of Burton's investigation in Africa are transparently filmed against a matte painting. Perhaps though, James Earl Jones in a locust costume is the official jumping-the-shark moment. This is the worst second chapter of a horror blockbuster outside of 'Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows'. Even on its own wobbly structure (along with an Atari-esque midi theme), 'Exorcist II' is a toothlessly unmitigated fiasco that desecrates the memory of the Academy Award-nominated original.",

It has Father Philip Lamont (Richard Burton), who has been assigned by a head Cardinal (Paul Henreid) to investigate the death of Father Lankester Merrin (Max Von Sydow). The Church do not believe Satan exists, but Merrin's writings claim he did, which put him at loggerheads with the Church. Lamont goes to Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair) who is training to be a stage actress, and Regan has been having counselling with Dr. Gene Tuskin (Louise Fletcher), using a technique known as synchronizer, where brainwaves and memories are melded and combined. Lamont learns that the evil within Regan isn't all gone, and it's been lying dormant. It should have been a good film, but it had a nightmarish production, with the script being re-written everyday, Boorman becoming sick for a month during shooting and some of the cast fell to mystery illnesses and some of the crew quit too.

Shoot, the material is so dried up with this sequel that this may as well be the fifth outing for the \"Exorcist\" series, yet regardless of what you think about this film, the Devil is back with a vengeance, and quite frankly, I'm surprised it took him so long to catch up with Linda Blair.

Hm, I was about to question why they got people with backgrounds that aren't all that holy to be holy people, - corrupted or not - but Burton was such a big drunk that he's perfect to play a priest, and at any rate, this film's purity is so questionable that the psych doctor in this film is, of all people, Louise Fletcher. She will soon know what Jack Nicholson is talking about when he asks someone if they've ever \"danced with the Devil in the pale moonlight\", and by soon, I mean in twelve years after this film, when Tim Burton's \"Batman\" came out. Forget the Devil, I'd be more afraid of being possessed by Jack Nicholson, or at least I am now that this film has kind of watered down the thrills behind Satan's work, and while that's not to say that this film is quite as messy as they say, it is to say that this film has its limitations, even on paper.\r\n\r\nI'm not asking that this film's story concept be quite as juicy as its predecessor's, - which, to be fair, wasn't exactly wealthy with potential - but this subject matter is even more minimalist than a predecessor that was arguably too light in scale and dynamicity for its own good, and to make matters worse, there's some questionability within this mythology, which is sometimes intelligent, but also sometimes fairly cheesy. If nothing else, the film's story concept seems cheesy, because William Goodhart's and an uncredited Rospo Pallenberg's script is so cheesy, at least at times, when dialogue hits fall-flat moments, and histrionics come into play, reflecting a certain consistency in subtlety issues. This film holds the potential of being smart, but many of the lapses in subtlety are glaring, with some being, well, kind of dumb, and no matter how much entertainment value and highlights get the final product by as decent, the writing lowlights are hard to deny, particularly when they begin to fiddle with the integrity of characterization. I suppose characterization is passable, and many of the performances are certainly endearing enough to bring the improvably drawn characters to life, but on paper, there's something lacking about developmental depth, resulting in undercooking that distances you a bit from the characters, especially considering that this film has a good bit of time that it could have dedicated to exposition, but ends up dedicating to draggy, repetitious material that meanders along, stressing natural shortcomings and being itself stressed by atmospheric pacing problems. Really, the film might not be quite as slow as its predecessor, and yet, when the meditativeness that was much more prominent in 1973's \"The Exorcist\" comes into play here, it's not quite as effective as it should be, having engaging moments, but many more moments in which material is not soaked up enough to compensate for atmospheric dry spells that dull things down and further distance you from a film whose writing, alone, places plenty of challenges before your investment. The film isn't quite as big of a mess as they say, but it's still a mess, and a big enough one to where mediocrity stands as a very real risk, backed by dynamicity, dramatic and pacing shortcomings that make the final product, at the very least, a substantially inferior sequel that held quite a bit of potential. I was joking earlier, when I boasted that material in this series has already dried up, because this is a pretty different sequel that stands to be more, but doesn't exactly fall as flat as they say, being flawed nearly to no end, but nevertheless with highlights, even stylistic ones.\r\n\r\nNow, in a lot of ways, the film falls behind the stylistic value of its predecessor, and by its own right, this film's stylistic value isn't all that special, but it's still worth mentioning, at least in a visual respect, as William A. Fraker's turns in a cinematographic performance whose tasteful emphasis on sparse lighting makes the brighter moments haunting and the darker moments chilling, especially when backed by imagery whose technical value has become quite dated, but remains adequate enough to enhance the telling of this tale, which perhaps needs as much help as it can. Again, this film's story concept is improvable, having questionable elements, or, if nothing else, too much minimalist, but quite frankly, there's still potential here, thanks in part to a mythology that may be particularly questionable in some ways, but is either intelligent at times or simply endearing within its own context. As for the basic plot itself, it's messy, even on paper, but still with some intrigue to its ambiguities and layers that may not be great, and are certainly undercut by writing issues, but can still be see through highlights in storytelling, as well as highlights in the portrayals of the characters who drive quite a few elements. Acting material is even more limited this time around, after a very dramatic predecessor, and there are a few mediocre supporting performances, but on the whole, decency is found throughout this rather charming cast, with leading man Richard Burton standing out about as much as he can with thorough charisma, as well as a few gripping layers as an open-minded man of God who begins to tap into dark religious depths on a revelatory and dangerous adventure. Burton carries the film about as much as anyone, and he's not the only endearing force in this cast, so the onscreen talent is there, even if the offscreen talent is limited, and yet, the performances found on the screen are not the only ones that get you by. There is still a good bit of credit due to director John Boorman's, whose efforts are messy, but have distinctly notable highlights, for although tension is much more limited in this film than it was in the predecessor, with effective imagery and genuine highlights in material bite, as well as some strong elements within the great Ennio Morricone's tasteful score, Boorman crafts an atmosphere with effective highlights that punctuate a consistent degree of intrigue that keep the bland spells - of which there are many - from dulling too far down. Really, what saves the film is a fair degree of entertainment value, for although the final product is a mess, it's not so faulty that I couldn't stick with it as a reasonably charming and sometimes effective thriller, regardless of its many shortcomings.\r\n\r\nIn closing, natural shortcomings, backed by a questionable mythology, go emphasized by enough cheesiness, underdevelopment and pacing unevenness to threaten the final product with mediocrity, but through a striking visual style, decent performances, - particularly that of Richard Burton - and adequately intriguing and sometimes effective direction by John Boorman behind a fairly engaging story concept, \"Exorcist II: The Heretic\" emerges as a, for me, endearing thriller, even if it does fall a considerable ways short of its predecessor.\r\n\r\n2.5/5 - Fair",

            "content": "Coming off of 'The Scariest Movie of All Time,' it would seem that a sequel to THE EXORCIST would be rather straightforward -- a new demon, a new child, another exorcism -- but somewhere, somehow, things went horribly, horribly wrong. Screenwriter William Goodhart and director John Boorman instead decide take us on their own confusing journey of faith, discovery, and sacrifice.\n\nRegan MacNeil has grown up to become a normal teenager, with no recollection of the terrible possession that befell her just four years earlier. Her psychologist is convinced that Regan is repressing the memories of the events, and that she could easily fall under the influence of the demon once again. Meanwhile, the Roman Catholic Church has sent a priest out to investigate the death of Father Merrin, which leads him to Regan. Using a hypnotic \"synchronizer\" that links his mind with hers, Father Lamont comes in contact with the demon Pazuzu, who takes him on a trip through time and space to meet another boy he had once possessed. Lamont seeks out Kokumo in Africa and learns that he, too, had rejected the demon, only to become the savior of his people. Now armed with the knowledge needed to save Regan's soul, Father Lamont returns to Georgetown for a final showdown with Pazuzu!\n\nEXORCIST II really is a test of faith, but one taken by the audience. Disbelief must be suspended from the highest peak in order for anyone to accept the preposterous plot, which blends pseudo-science with religious mumbo jumbo. Richard Burton, a seven-time Oscar-nominee, is made to look like a fool as the deranged Father Lamont, who quickly becomes fascinated by the demon he looks to destroy. He often rambles like a psychotic, and makes for a terrible lead when he cannot be trusted by the audience. It is impossible to take Linda Blair seriously, either, when she is forced to go cross-eyed and act brain-dead during the ridiculous \"synchronization\" experiments. Thankfully, the special effects, cinematography, and incredible locations far outweigh the strength of the script, but EXORCIST II is still widely criticized as being one of the worst sequels in the genre.\n\n-Carl Manes\nI Like Horror Movies",
