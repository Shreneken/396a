            "content": "An All Time Classic. Everything is fundamentally excellent. The first 40 minutes trots a long at a very leisurely pace in one location and is extremely dialogue heavy with nothing else that memorable to look at. The catch is the dialogue is extremely engaging, well acted, and well written despite being a massive expose dumb. The kill is extremely well done and very suspenseful. Once things go off the rails everything gets flipped on its head and is pretty unpredictable from there out. It is very witty, engaging, and suspenseful the whole way through with a very satisfying ending that had a huge grin on my face. Great music also that's really memorable. Everyone should give this a try once. Just be patient through the huge expose, it's worth it.",

            "content": "A complicated set of overlapped schemes and sharp-witted conspirators collide in this classic piece of Hitchcockian suspense. The name of the game is inheritance, by way of a murder most foul, with an unfaithful wife (Grace Kelly) set up as the unwary victim. She's a wealthy young socialite, bored by a trophy husband whose glory days are already in the past, while he's a listless retired tennis ace who seeks to spin his jaded love's infidelity into a comfortable life as a well-paid widower. In spending months preparing his ruse, it seems the villain has thought of everything, but, as we're often told, even the best laid plans often go awry.\n\nDial M For Murder has roots on the stage, where it enjoyed a favorable run, two years prior, on both sides of the Atlantic. As such, there's plenty of quick-lipped dialogue and few changes in scenery, but it's more than just filmed theater. Under Hitchcock's enlightened direction, the screen brims with hints and cues. As various nasty plots come undone and/or bear fruit, the camera whirls and spins like a dizzied housewife, establishing a sense of overwhelmed helplessness. It's crafty filmmaking, smart and inventive with no blatant flaunts. Doubly impressive when we consider its original format as a 3-D showpiece. This could've been an extra-tacky disaster, but instead it's aged very gracefully. Thank the director's restraint, and the razor-sharp script, in equal measures. Dial M knows how to push my buttons.",

First of all, is the breathtaking cinematography, which is nearly always the best thing in a Hitchcock film. The script is a gem, showing that you are capable of anything, and most of the time, it is very tense and rarely slips. That said, my only complaint, is that one or two scenes such as the ending do fall flat, compared to the rest of the film. However, the film also has a wonderful music score, and fantastic performances from the entire cast. Ray Milland, an actor I really want to get more familiar with, is excellent as Tony Wendice, the husband planning to murder his wife, and make it a perfect murder. As Margot, the beautiful Grace Kelly is the picture of beauty and vulnerability in a wonderful understated performance, perhaps outshining her co-star. Everyone else acquitted themselves well too, even Robert Cummings as Mark Halliday and John Williams as Inspector Hubbard. Overall, an excellent film, not Hitchcock's best, but well looking out for. 9/10 Bethany Cox.",

In the film, a retired athlete blackmails a former schoolmate into killing his wife who has been having an affair with a crime-fiction writer. When the ex-tennis player's scheme begins to fall apart, he then has to play a game of catch-up to cover his trails. The exposition in this film, while necessary, drags like a snail. But this works to the audience's advantage, because the first half hour of the film sets up several twists that the attentive will revisit, realize, and appreciate. Though \"Dial M\" is a tad lengthy, patience is definitely key with this slow-burning mystery/thriller. The suspense in this film is both agonizing and staggering. The overall story is smooth like butter, even though the characters in the story have trouble getting their own stories straight. This is one of the greatest crime stories of all time, no doubt. I highly recommend this film if you have the patience for suspense and the love for great mysteries. 86%!",

            "content": "Suspenseful direction with a complicated script.\n\nAlfred Hitchcock's suspense thriller Dial M for Murder (1954) is a riveting single room type film similar to Rope, yet not as extremely contained. Hitchcock makes great use of this tiny space by following faces, dialogue, and shifting perspectives to keep you engaged the entire time of Dial M for Murder's brief 105 minutes. Rudi Fehr's editing is very crafty to trick the audience into thinking they're watching more than just a space space by cutting in a few other sets that are mostly surrounding this one apartment with one dinner hall for a single sequence. Robert Burks' cinematography is very gripping with plenty of striking close-up shots. You are constantly focused on a character's reaction to a piece of information, so that you are distracted from the fact that there's little action in Dial M for Murder as it's almost all talking.\n\nDimitri Tiomkin's score is pretty with his usual flamboyant flair for his stunning classical music. He adds an intensity to the atmosphere. Frederick Knott's writing is both intricately plotted for this crime narrative, but there are too many convenient coincidences to make the plot work. The police do not question the witness immediately, solely relying on her husband's testimony version of events. \n\nFurthermore, John Williams' inspector strangely breaks into the home on a hunch about keys that he could not possibly have not about. I refuse to believe the endless string of events that allow for the latch keys to end up where they all are and in their specific condition just because not only the inspector, but also the third wheel figures it all out way too quickly. The brilliant criminal scheme is undone in a few moments by a series of gullible people. It makes the ending capture less satisfying.\n\nMoss Mabry's costumes are lovely. All of Grace Kelly's outfits are adorable and gorgeous on her petite frame as Margot Wendice. Her red dress and grey suits are really memorable. Grace Kelly is so pretty in Dial M for Murder and plays her character so distraught that you are of course sympathetic to her plight. I don't think that Grace Kelly got to say or do much though in Dial M for Murder. She's so beautiful that is doesn't really matter I suppose. Robert Cummings says and does nothing until it's convenient for the plot to decide Mark Halliday knows everything and figured it all out because he writes murder mysteries of course!\n\nAnthony Dawson is really intriguing as the mysterious Charles Swann. He has a sense of gravitas and mystique about him that may be because he looks like Vincent Price with his distinct mustache. Dawson draws you in with his worried expressions and captivating face.\n\nLastly, Ray Milland is astute as the genius criminal mastermind Tony Wendice. His particular pronunciation is completely compelling. He looks in control and you are hanging onto his every word as Dial M for Murder goes on to its twisting finale.\n\nIn short, Dial M for Murder is well made by the suspense master Alfred Hitchcock with a solid cast. But much of the suspense gets undone by muddled writing over complicating the crime. It is a very entertaining movie, but rather shallow as far as Hitchcock goes. Dial M for Murder is better than Strangers on a Train, which has a similar plot, but it doesn't compare to other Hitchcock classics like Shadow of a Doubt or Rear Window.",

Just because it was originally written as a play does not mean you should still act as if is a stage production. That aside, we have a fine storyline from a strong screenplay (some dialogue excepted). Hitchcock leads us through the intricacies of the both husband's plan as well as the investigation by the detective who doesn't quit on the case when he gets a notion that there's more to things than what he's been told or seen so far. And nearly all of it occurs in this one apt. or just outside of it. \nHitchcock and his players build and hold the suspense well. And while I'm still put off some by the acting approach of the times, which would begin to greatly change soon but really evolve in the '60's & '70's, this is still a fine suspense thriller. Another negative for me is the insistent sappy strings used in much of the film. Not exactly Morricone or Zimmer.  3.6 stars",

            "content": "What is told repetitively, what is romanticized, what is pure, is the final trick.\n\nDial M For Murder\n\nAlfred Hitchcock is a great adapter. From books to plays, his adaptation is simply ingenious. And maybe, only because he never lets it lose the essence of where it comes from. What the source is. Which then of course can be argued as both an advantage or a disastrous disadvantage. And Dial M For Murder suffers the same consequences that Rope does. The play is written with very few scenes in mind. Scenes with long conversations in mind and long conversation that swoops in every behind the stage activity occurring both before and after the sequence. It can be a bit cheesy, fortunately it is not here.\n\nAnd this is how Hitchcock dodges all the social rigmarole that a structure of this film comes with. More than 90% of the film is staged in one set piece only. The hall, the main room, the entrance room of this murderous apartment. So why do we despite knowing all these issues that are about to come, still fall for its topsy turvy script. Only because, Hitchcock frames exactly what the audience is going through. That is why he is still loved. Even decades later, his films are satisfying.\n\nWalking in on the murder mystery film, every audience member appoints itself to be the detective of the case, the film. And what all it, the audience, wants to do is analyse every last detail of that crime scene. And Hitchcock gives them exactly what they want. Split into three acts, the first act is the planning of that crime scene. The second is the crime scene going wrong just as it was planned and was to be narrated to the executioners. And the third is justifying the wrong doers deed. And it is a finale in the sense that we aren't told how this will go down unlike the previous acts.",

With the exception of a men's club scene that is easily skippable, the entire enterprise takes place in one apartment with about six people. There are no car chases or explosions. not even a gunshot. I bring this up because of a pet peeve of mine. I constantly hear the excuse that the movie wasn't good because of the budget. The ye olde they did what they could with what they had. \n\nWhat they, of course, should say is our scriptwriter and actors lack talent what do you expect. Nobody wants to say that so he or she blame the budget. What could you expect for so little money? Literally, you could perform this entire film in your own living room. \n\nNow in all fairness to all those aspiring Hitchcocks out there, most of you don't have a successful stage play as a starting point neither do you have a Grace Kelly or Ray Milland among your group of friends. (You probably have at least one Robert Cummings). That really does make a difference in a one-room play to screen adaptation (See Glengarry Glen Ross when it comes to stacking the acting deck). \n\nThe story is nice and tight and expertly told. Ray Milland s perfect as the genial murderer while Grace Kelly really is a stunning beauty in this one. To the point one really has to wonder about Ray Milland's plan.

This film seems to get relegated to second-tier Hitchcock status since it's essentially a filmed play ... heavy on dialogue and restricted to only one setting. I don't really agree. Sometimes the right thing to do when filming a play is to open it up, but that depends upon whether anything could be added to the play by removing it from it's stage setting. There's nothing in this play that invites this. Interestingly, I think \"Rope\" would be subject to the same criticism if it weren't for the technical experimentation Hitchcock brought to it with the simulation of a single-take. He did a similar thing with this film by using 3D to simulate the effect of the proscenium arch, but that is lost on modern audiences since it is rarely shown in 3D.",

I was glued to the screen as I watched the plot unfold, and each step of the way I was dying to see what would happen next. Its like one mystery after the next and with each one there comes renewed tension for me as a viewer. The way the story is structured allows the viewer to know exactly how things are supposed to work so we feel the drama waiting for the inevitable. Also there is a fair amount of foreshadowing which pays off brilliantly later on in the story (lets just say having a mystery writer as a character is a great idea.)\n\nRay Milland is one of the primary reasons this movie works so well. He is left with the unenviable task of delivering massive amounts of exposition, and also having entire silent scenes alone on screen doing a lot of physical work. It all hinges on him keeping it interesting in both types of scenes, and he nails it. Im always fascinated by the kind of dialogue where a person is saying one thing and you can tell they mean something different, and thats almost half of what is going on for Milland. It doesnt hurt that he has a brilliant cast of actors with him including Grace Kelly, Robert Cummings, Anthony Dawson, and John Williams. All of them are vital to making the movie work.\n\nI am constantly reminded how much I love Hitchcocks style of film-making. For one thing, he uses the camera in interesting ways in order to make a shot as effective for the scene as possible. Like in the murder planning scene he goes to a high and wide angle so we can see the entire room laid out like a map. Then he captures it all in what seems like a single shot so we can take in the full order of events as they are supposed to happen later. He also uses darkness and silent pauses to create dramatic pressure which builds up until the viewer is ready to pop, and just when we can stand it no more things explode. Its all about pacing between the way actors move, the music, and everything else, and I love it! I could go on, but theres only so many ways I can praise what is obviously a brilliant movie I loved and will revisit soon. I suspect this will rival some of my all-time favorites soon.",

            "content": "Dial M for Murder was adapted for the big screen from a Broadway play of the same name. The original writer of the play, Frederick Knott, also wrote the screenplay. Both him and director Alfred Hitchcock chose to remain faithful to the original; almost the entire film is played out inside a living room. That is not to say that the film is claustrophobic, Hitchcock provides us with a crisp presentation of the geography of the fated apartment.\n\n\tThe story line is simple, an opportunistic husband wants to (permanently) get rid of his adulterous, rich wife. Out of the 4 main actors, John Williams shines as the gritty chief inspector, a role he also played in the Broadway version, although his well-practiced performance is eclipsed by the one from Ray Milland, who plays the villainous husband. He keeps his gentlemanly ways until the end of the film, but there is always a sinister shadow at the edge of his constant smile. Grace Kelly as the victimized wife  and Robert Cummings as the wife's lover, deliver stock performances; albeit not mis-casted, the give us nothing to be excited about.\n\n\tOne thing that will indeed excite most of us, is the variety of thriller scenes; this is one stirring film. The pace picks up from the beginning and it doesn't stop until the end. The plot is mildly predictable, but fortunately it has a few surprises in store. Modern audiences may be taken aback from the lengthy dialogue, but the aforementioned thrills will keep them from getting bored. One other interesting aspect is how Hitchcock manages how we sympathize between the love triangle. Although the husband is clearly the villain, I had a hard time distributing my sympathy.\n\n\tDial M for Murder isn't Hitchcock's best film, fans know that is not Hitchcock's best 1954 film, but it is a good thriller that is ready to entertain the majority of today's viewers. 7.0/10.",

Ray Milland's dialogue delivery is horrible in the beginning but gets better later and Mark's cautious and caring character could have been a little more interesting.

            "content": "One of Alfred Hitchcock's greatest strengths was his ability to manage enormous set pieces and make them extremely memorable. Take the plane crash scene in Foreign Correspondent, the Royal Albert Hall scene in The Man Who Knew Too Much, or the crop duster chase in North by Northwest. Ironically, one of the Master of Suspense's finest hours came with 1954's Dial M for Murder, which takes place almost exclusively in one London apartment. It's a testament to Hitchcock's incalculable skill that he manages to cram so much tension into every frame and every word, while his delightfully rich characters populate this tiny space. As a result, Dial M for Murder is an achievement of the highest order and one of Hitchcock's best films.\n\nTony Wendice (Ray Milland) is a retired tennis pro who has reached a breaking point in his marriage. His wife, Margot (Grace Kelly), has been cheating on him with an American, Mark (Robert Cummings), and though Tony has suspected something for quite a while, he's finally decided to act. But rather than divorce her and lose his affluent lifestyle (his money is all his wife's), he decides to hire a man to murder her. The plan seems flawless, but things go wrong, and Margot ends up killing the murderer. On the fly, Tony rethinks the plan and comes up with another seemingly flawless one to frame his wife for killing the man out of revenge.\n\nRay Milland, I think, was born to play this role. He's such a chilling villain that we almost root for him to succeed. He delivers every line with such ease and confidence that you'd never expect him to be a total sociopath. While most probably remember him for his great, Oscar-winning work in The Lost Weekend, his might be the actor's finest performance.\n\nAs far as acting goes, Milland does most of the heavy lifting, but he's not the only star. Grace Kelly has a surprisingly thankless role as Margot, so she's a bit of a non-starter in this case. The other star, as far as acting is concerned, is John Williams as the Chief Investigator. He, like Milland, plays everything so cool. It's a role that could have been a throwaway, but Williams makes him memorable-especially the closing shot, which was just fantastic.\n\nOf course, no one in this film is outshining Hitchcock and his brilliant direction. Every camera angle and cut is a deliberate tool to build tension. See the murder scene for evidence of this. It's the only time the film moves away from the apartment, and as we transition from a panicked Tony to scene of the crime, we're on the edge of our seat.\n\nIt would have been interesting to see Dial M for Murder in 3-D, like it was originally released. It's not the kind of film you'd think should be in 3-D, but it's the only instance in which Hitchcock used this technology. But 3-D or 2-D, this is a brilliant film that is a must-see for all Hitchcock fans.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/dial-m-for-murder-review/",

            "content": "To say this movie is as fantastic as it is and then it not be considered one of Hitchcock's very best, well it only goes to prove how amazing a director he was. Dial M for Murder is a very dialogue heavy movie, but don't let that fool you into thinking it may be boring or well, too laden with conversations. The film is truly thrilling and working out what will happen next is no easy game, Hitchcock gets the absolute most out of the play it is adapted from and the most from the cast too, with the likes of Ray Milland, Grace Kelly and Robert Cummings all shining in their respective roles. It of course centres on a plan for a husband to off his wife called Margot (Kelly) by her husband Tony (Milland), of course Tony thinks he has the perfect murder, and even if he hasn't, he has a few tricks he can pull.\n\nThe story moves along at a nice pace, never too fast or too slow and constantly fits itself nicely into its running time. Hitchcock just knew here how to truly get the scenes he wanted and uses things like light to truly create a sense of doom or a sense of hope, fine work from the director considered one of the best at suspense. I wasn't all together sure on the score for the film which can at times sound like some kind of cartoon or in any case a much happier film and although it can be used well, it just doesn't feel right sometimes. To be fair other than the score there isn't too much wrong with this at all, acting maybe not always on point but I'll come to that next.\n\nI wasn't always so sure on Grace Kelly, many a person who has seen this has mentioned her as doing a good job but I didn't feel she was at her very best. The by far best cast member has to be Ray Milland who kind of has to step up in this movie so we see him as the evil he is, but that also we can follow him through the story without getting bored. John Williams as Inspector Hubbard is a good addition to the cast and can actually at times add a little comedic relief randomly here and there, he over time becomes a character you come to not mind as much as maybe when he first walks in. \n\nOne thing about this movie that I can't say I have seen much is the way in which it lets you follow the protagonist but he is not good and although inside you do not want him to succeed, you expect that everything that happens will all go to plan (whether it does or not well you will have to see). Yet again Hitchcock brings us this nice little gem of a thing, he really gets the camera put on Milland but in a way where although he is in the shot, he remains behind peoples backs and he moves away from others a lot, it feels like it is meant for him to seem distant and of course more sinister than other characters.\n\nOverall Dial M for Murder is as I said not really thought of as within Hitchcock's absolute best works but this is really an excellent little piece, worth a watch whether a fan of Hitchcock or you have never seen one of his films before. He does of course borrow elements from past films and that makes this not any copy of his previous works, but it actually also makes it much better as he can draw from his own inspiration but then make a film like this that feels like a play (of which as mentioned it is based on).",

            "content": "Sometimes it is the most simplest of ideas and executions, that actually grip us as an audience the most. Dial M for Murder, is without a doubt, one of the best examples of this. Based on the theatre play and soaked with Hitchcockian content, Dial M, is set around a love affair between Margot Wendice and Mark Halloway. When Mark comes to visit the already married Margot and her husband Tony, Margot explains to Mark how she had been receiving odd letters from an unknown source, claiming that unless she paid the source money, they would expose the couple to Tony, a washed up Tennis player. Worried about what may happen, the love birds float around an idea of telling Tony, however before they can Mark is forced into a string of dates with Tony himself and it appears that Tony plans to hire someone to kill his wife and to reap the financial awards from it. It's extremely basic stuff, however the performances and dialogue thrown from Grace Kelly, Richard Cummings and of course Ray Milland is extremely gripping stuff. They are all wonderful actors, in their own right, and here get quite a lengthy, however fairly static, piece of material to work with. Hitchcock, naturally unfolds the story in his usual, expertly crafted way, giving visual clues and hints, making the viewer feel like they have stepped into the shoes of Paroit. Each scene and shot is meticulously crafted and serve purpose, there is very little, if any filler in here what so ever. This is testament to Hitchcock himself, he doesnt burden the viewer with too much, he merely gives them all they need and by the conclusion, we find ourselves being extremely satisfied with the conclusion we are left with. It is also, extremely dark, its amazing to think that the content of this film back in the day, was deemed fairly standard and its brilliant to watch a more toned down but equally tense and chilling crime thriller at work here. You are completely enveloped into the characters, situations and actions and you will constantly find yourself gripping the edge of your seat, not just for the good guys, but for the villains also, which is a rare talent. Conventionally we are taught to root for the good guys, regardless of how appealing and interesting the bad guys motives and ideals may be. Some directors even go as far as to flip this technique on its head, having you root for evil over good, however Hitchcock does a rare thing here, by allowing you to see complete motive behind everyones actions, although not exactly a conventional way of dealing with things, you can understand Tony's frustration, he is out of money, his wife is cheating on him and is desperate to achieve some form of closure and right of passage. He has reason and motive for hatching his plan, Hitchcock never shows it as being acceptable, however he shows it as a conclusion, that someone may come to, under the right circumstances and he furthers this with a brilliantly choreographed scene between Tony and the would be killer.The killer, although coersed into his actions, finds it acceptable enough to go through with the plan, these are small details, but they are details that matter. Dial M for Murder, is a brilliantly crafted master class in film making, it is so overly simple it becomes complex and brilliant, it oozes character and its tension and suspense will have you gripping your seat for the run time. Are there down sides, well if I were to nitpick John Williams as the detective does come across as slightly over acted, but he isnt terrible and the focus is so firmly rooted on the love triangle that he serves only as a means of moving the story forward and unravelling the twists and turns. He is needed and although his execution is nowhere near as perfected as the great James Stewart in Rope, another brilliant Hitchcock piece, he does do exactly what his character should do. It is a minor niggle and thats the great thing about Hitchcock, he knows what the focus should be on at all times, and he executes this practise flawlessly with this film.",

But what we forget is that Hitchcock made this film in 3-D which explains why there are so many low-angle shots. Warner Bros forced him to do so, but in a way we can call this another experimentation from the Master of Suspense. It is by far his most wordy film and  just like Rope the screenplay was adapted from a play. The film takes place almost entirely in a small British apartment where Tony (Ray Milland) and Margot (Grace Kelly) live. Over a year ago Margot had an affair with an American crime author named Mark (Robert Cummings) who is now returning to England. Mark meets with Margot and that is where we are introduced to their backstory. They had had a very torrid love affair and he continued to write to her after he returned to America, but she didn't. She explains that after Mark left, her husband had decided to quit tennis to spend more time with her and that she didn't want to leave him anymore. What Margot doesn't know however, is that her husband discovered her secret affair and was simply waiting for the perfect opportunity to have his revenge. Tony blackmails one of his  former schoolmates, Swann (Anthony Dawson), and convinces him to murder his wife while he goes to a guys reunion with Mark providing the perfect alibi. Tony has been planning this perfect murder for quite some time so he can inherit her money (she is the one with the wealthy family). But something unexpected happens and the film took some interesting and clever turns that had me at the edge of my seat.\n\nI've mentioned before that in my opinion Hitchcock directed his best movies during the 50's and this is yet another great example of a film that was made during the height of his career. There might not be as many innovative filming techniques here, but the heart of the film relies on its clever story full of unexpected twists. This is the very definition of a mystery film and it stands out for the story alone. If you don't like wordy films then this isn't one for you because it feels very theatrical considering it takes place mostly in one room and it relies heavily on explanations. It's no secret that Hitchcock knows perfectly well how to create suspense and he manages to do so in this talkative movie relying on dialogue this time around more than on anything else. Although I do have to say that the confrontation between Kelly's character and Dawson is incredibly tense and filmed perfectly. It's one of the best scenes in the movie and very memorable as well. There is something about the mystery story here that feels like it was taken from an Agatha Christie novel or from Sherlock Holmes, and Hitchcock knew that he had a great story to work with and relied on the power of storytelling this time around.\n\nGrace Kelly is perhaps one of my favorite Hitchcock leading ladies and this might be her best role. I loved Rear Window and she was wonderful in it, but James Stewart owned that film. Here Grace Kelly shines in every scene and she is wonderful in the surprise attack scene as well. Ray Milland, who was unknown to me, did a wonderful job in the lead villain role, while Robert Cummings also delivered. I expected his character to be the one to figure everything out, but Hitchcock does include some clever twists and it's someone else who takes on the role of Sherlock Holmes, John Williams, who plays the Chief Inspector in this film. In a talky film like this, it is very important that you have convincing actors to play the roles and I felt that the cast delivered solid performances. This film may fly under the radar in Hitchcock's astonishing filmography, but I had a really good time with the screenplay and enjoyed it more than some other beloved Hitchcock films.    \n\nhttp://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",

But what we forget is that Hitchcock made this film in 3-D which explains why there are so many low-angle shots. Warner Bros forced him to do so, but in a way we can call this another experimentation from the Master of Suspense. It is by far his most wordy film and  just like Rope the screenplay was adapted from a play. The film takes place almost entirely in a small British apartment where Tony (Ray Milland) and Margot (Grace Kelly) live. Over a year ago Margot had an affair with an American crime author named Mark (Robert Cummings) who is now returning to England. Mark meets with Margot and that is where we are introduced to their backstory. They had had a very torrid love affair and he continued to write to her after he returned to America, but she didn't. She explains that after Mark left, her husband had decided to quit tennis to spend more time with her and that she didn't want to leave him anymore. What Margot doesn't know however, is that her husband discovered her secret affair and was simply waiting for the perfect opportunity to have his revenge. Tony blackmails one of his  former schoolmates, Swann (Anthony Dawson), and convinces him to murder his wife while he goes to a guys reunion with Mark providing the perfect alibi. Tony has been planning this perfect murder for quite some time so he can inherit her money (she is the one with the wealthy family). But something unexpected happens and the film took some interesting and clever turns that had me at the edge of my seat.\n\nI've mentioned before that in my opinion Hitchcock directed his best movies during the 50's and this is yet another great example of a film that was made during the height of his career. There might not be as many innovative filming techniques here, but the heart of the film relies on its clever story full of unexpected twists. This is the very definition of a mystery film and it stands out for the story alone. If you don't like wordy films then this isn't one for you because it feels very theatrical considering it takes place mostly in one room and it relies heavily on explanations. It's no secret that Hitchcock knows perfectly well how to create suspense and he manages to do so in this talkative movie relying on dialogue this time around more than on anything else. Although I do have to say that the confrontation between Kelly's character and Dawson is incredibly tense and filmed perfectly. It's one of the best scenes in the movie and very memorable as well. There is something about the mystery story here that feels like it was taken from an Agatha Christie novel or from Sherlock Holmes, and Hitchcock knew that he had a great story to work with and relied on the power of storytelling this time around.\n\nGrace Kelly is perhaps one of my favorite Hitchcock leading ladies and this might be her best role. I loved Rear Window and she was wonderful in it, but James Stewart owned that film. Here Grace Kelly shines in every scene and she is wonderful in the surprise attack scene as well. Ray Milland, who was unknown to me, did a wonderful job in the lead villain role, while Robert Cummings also delivered. I expected his character to be the one to figure everything out, but Hitchcock does include some clever twists and it's someone else who takes on the role of Sherlock Holmes, John Williams, who plays the Chief Inspector in this film. In a talky film like this, it is very important that you have convincing actors to play the roles and I felt that the cast delivered solid performances. This film may fly under the radar in Hitchcock's astonishing filmography, but I had a really good time with the screenplay and enjoyed it more than some other beloved Hitchcock films.    \n\nhttp://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",

I've always enjoyed a Hitchcock film, which is synonym for a genius plot with surprising twists. This one tells the story of a man who plans to have his wife murdered. A real classic and a must-see for everyone who calls him/herself a movie lover.

Although he was furious, he never confronted her, because a divorce would mean he couldn't live the wealthy life he's leading with her money. But on the day that Mark is in London and comes to visit Margot, pretending to be an old acquaintance, Tony devises a cunning plan.

It is about an ex-tennis pro who \"hires\" someone to murder his wife because he is jealous of her affair with an American crime novelist. I found the story to be quite enjoyable, keeping me on the edge of my seat, thinking how on earth Tony would get away with it? The film plays itself out like a play, where most of the film takes place inside this apartment, containing scenes that go on for a while but not at a point did it slow the film down or feel uninteresting. The film cuts straight to the point by constantly giving the audience plot details and character development, ergo full attention must be given to the film at all times. The film's characters are actually quite shallow in my opinion, but I never saw this as an issue, due to Hitchcock's precise direction. Hitchcock didn't aim for this film to reach the thematic depths of Vertigo or Psycho, instead he focuses on the film's ability to thrill and draw out emotions, just like Rear Window and North by Northwest, but keeping the film, presumably, faithful to its source material. Maybe I feel this way towards the film, because I didn't give myself enough effort to actually search for themes and deep character development, as I gave myself in to the intensity and thrill of the story, to the point that I didn't even mind that the film's conclusion was too on point and handled with haste. Dial M for Murder is a prime example of top tier Hitchcock that delivers thrills that other films like it just couldn't deliver.",

Well, that's only six digits so if you're looking for a good time, then that girl just gave a wrong and profoundly disturbing number. Oh please, that's not too much cheesier than the actual title here, which I still give a lot of credit for being unique. Well, it was unique in 1954, but now, at a time where \"The Simpsons\" really did release an episode titled \"Dial 'N' for Nerder\", I reckon it's safe to say that it's not as much fun anymore, so they may as well bill this as the sequel to Alfred Hitchcock's \"Strangers on a Train\", \"When a Stranger Calls\". Honestly, phones aren't hugely prominent in this film, although it is probably the first film that made phones scary, which should tell you just how talented Hitchcock was as a suspense filmmaker, because he somehow managed to make phones suspenseful. I don't know about you guys, but Morse Code confuses me to a practically scary point, so if they ever make a horror film involving telegraphs, then I'll either laugh hysterically or scream whenever I hear that Dire Straits song, you know, more than I usually do. Man, \"Telegraph Road\" is an awesome song, but hey, this film ain't too shabby either, even though it leaves you \"hanging on the line\" in certain places (No, the \"1-800-MURDER\" joke was not lame enough for me).\n\nAt times, it feels as though the drama is making quite the effort to freshen things up, but in too many other places, it falls short, into familiarity, especially as an Alfred Hitchcock film, complete with formulaic dialogue, predictable plotting and even a touch too much ambiguity for characterization's own good. The film doesn't have much new stuff to discuss, nor does it have much to say at all, at least in terms of development, exposing you to problematic character traits that fail to go justified by thoroughly well-rounded exposition which gets you firmly invested in the characters. That being said, the film still takes plenty of time to bloat itself, and not exactly with an excess in colorful or dynamic material, dragging chit-chat and other minimalist happenings on and on, almost to the point of monotony, but decidedly to the point of blandness. I don't know if the film is so much dull, as its writing and direction have enough bite to keep you reasonably interested throughout the final product, yet there's just so much meandering to this almost aimlessly talkative thriller, and the more it meanders, the more difficult it is to disregard that the film was never to have all that much to say. Not simply conventional, or undercooked, or overdrawn, this film's story is minimal, with only so much lively material to beef up potential, no matter how much Frederick Knott's script works to compensate through overblown dramatic theatrics. What might have worked better on the stage on which Knott introduced his vision feels a touch too melodramatic here, just as the story feels even more minimalist, even with you taking out of account the formulaic and unevenly paced scripted execution that secure the final product as underwhelming. The film could have at least come close to rewarding, but before too long, momentum fails to be sustained, and yet, it's hard to not be at least a little driven on by this decent thriller, at least aesthetically.\n\nAlthough \"Rope\" was Alfred Hitchcock's first colored film, this particular project really kicked off his streak of colored classics, and while Robert Burks' cinematography isn't quite as lush as it was when backed by Technicolor for \"Rope\", there's still plenty of bounce to Burks' coloration, while lighting balances matters out with a certain bleakness that both attracts uniquely, and fits the gritty tone of this thriller. For the substance value to this style, credit is, of course, due to Hitchcock, whose solid framing joins visual style in drawing you into the environment, and whose atmosphere secures you through a thoughtfulness that, when not so backed with material of limited meat, bites with an audacious attention to subtle intensity. Of course, even when material to meditate upon lapses, the film never quite loses so much momentum that it becomes boring, for although the film is plenty bland in plenty of places, the thoughtfulness at least does a decent job of sustaining some degree of entertainment value by drawing on the story concept's natural intrigue. Again, intrigue is limited by the sheer minimalism of this story of small scale and little dynamicity, and yet, there's still something fairly meaty about this dramatic study on a murderous plot going all kinds of wrong, and it's hard to ignore that when Frederick Knott's scripted interpretation of his own play really works on the screen, with sharp dialogue and moments of melodrama that are effective enough to be bought in their context. Yes, there are solid moments in a generally pretty improvable script by Knott, with even characterization that is mostly lacking having highlights that do, in fact, draw you into the depths of this character-driven drama, though not as much as the consistently strong performances. Driven by more talk than action, this type of thriller really focuses on the performers, and they really do a fine job of holding their own, immersing themselves in each distinguished role, and further securing their convincingness by exchanging solid chemistry that makes the instrumental interactions in this character drama about as effective as the highlights in direction and writing do. Were the storytelling more consistently effective than the performances, the final product would have stood on the brink of rewarding, and if there was more inspiration, the natural shortcomings might have been transcended, yet when it's all said and done, there's enough intrigue throughout this thriller to engage time and again, even if it truly engrosses only every so often.\n\nWhen the line is finally cut, the film is left standing as too familiar for its own good, yet not so familiar that a sense of underdevelopment joins dragging and natural dramatic limitations to make the final product underwhelming, but not so much so that sharp cinematography, highlights in direction and writing, and solid performances don't prove to be enough to make \"Dial M for Murder\" a decent thriller, with sharp highlights, few and far between they may very much be.\n\n2.5/5 - Fair",

Yet I have problems with motives here and thematic presence. Hitchcock and his writers don't deliver like they do on others in terms of manipulating my emotions. Milland's reasoning for doing what he does and both Grace Kelly and Robert Cummings are all upsetting to me. It's what happens when the protags are having affairs. Nobody wins in this film but then again somebody does win even though one motive isn't justified over the other. The real character to root for is John Williams' chief inspector.

This is such a predictable film and it uses a plot similar to Rope(1948) without any of the punch from that one. This film has a pretty decent first half, but as it moves on to the second half, it succumbs into a formidable bunch of cliches. The character played by John Williams(ii) is a big cliche in all of the Hitchcock films, there is a similar character in Rope and in Psycho, they are just there to solve the crime. Actually that bitch deserved to die. She cheated on her marriage, she should have left her marriage instead of doing that and the director at no point hints that the extra marital affair is a sin just like committing or trying to commit a murder. I would have does the same thing had I been the husband, but the director withholds the extramarital affair as a different version of true love, what the FUCK?",

The whole film is really well done and the plot is incredibly compelling and it really works as a whole.

            "content": "Dial M for Murder is a classy 1950s Hitchcock 'murder mystery', suspense movie adapted from the stage play by Frederick Knott.   Although the film follows a well-trodden story line in which you know whodunit and you know who's  going to get his come-uppance in the end, you still want to see how it will all unfold.  The main characters - Tony (Ray Milland), his glamorous but subservient wife Margot (Grace Kelly), her lover Mark (Robert Cummings), and Swann (Anthony Dawson), the man hired by Tony to kill his wife  - do an impressive job playing their parts and the acting is skilled, subtle and believable (mostly).  The unassuming detective, Hubbard (who's not quite so believable and whose acting is a little dodgy), figures out more than he's letting on,  and lover-boy  Mark just so happens to be a crime writer so that's a handy combo when it comes to dealing with murder, intrigue,  and solving the 'perfect crime'.  The whole film takes place in Margot and Tony's apartment  (apart from a bizarre and slightly jarring court 'pastiche' where Margot's head appears in front of a swirly, colourful background that looked as if it was hastily crayoned on bristol board by an underemployed  boom-holder), followed by a disturbing flash of a red cloaked, improbably archaic judge.  But that's all by the by, as Kelly executes her role  perfectly, playing the obedient, compliant, and elegant, (but none too bright) wife and, in this day and age, it's quite amusing (or perhaps shocking?) to witness her deferral to hubby on just about everything. She 'does as she's told' even when circumstances scream out for her to take some initiative (well I screamed out anyway;  I mean, really...).  Her passivity was so well portrayed it made you want to shake her and yell 'get a backbone!' but that was the idea and it just leaves you so utterly thankful not to have been a wife in the '50s.  \n\nThe sharp and elegant apparel sported by the main characters provides a satisfying feast for the eyes and invokes nostalgia for the days when people actually 'dressed up' (even if they were staying in for the evening).  Schlepping about in tatty jeans and t-shirts wasn't an option - that's what makes films of this era so visually rich and decadent (not to mention the non-stop smoking and unabated supping of cocktails or hard liquor, morning, noon or night).  \nThe jaunty orchestral music is vintage cinematic  entertainment as are the dramatic crescendos of stringed instruments . We all know how Dial M for Murder will end but it's a clever and enjoyable ride and so absorbing I didn't even complain about it being  two hours long.",

He firstly did it with Rope, and although not as good as Dial M, I still think it's an interesting film.  He would do it again in his masterpiece Rear Window.  \n\nMuch of Dial M's appeal is in the screenplay, which would have to be great in order to make a movie like this one, that has such a limited setting, any good.  It's mainly the dialogue that has to keep the audience's attention.  It does an excellent job.

The plot is simple, yet it will make your head spin with all the accusations and revelations building throughout. It's obvious it was adapted from a play as the setting is mainly one apartment, and the dialogue is brisk and unbroken for long periods of time. The film is completely reliant on dialogue so at times it can feel a little slow, but it is so worth it making it to the end! Hitchcock truly knew how to build suspense, and this film is no exception; got to love that title too!",

The screenplay by Knotts is witty and intense, and that intensity is brought to the big screen in a skilful and skilfully planned way by the renowned master of suspense. Hitchcock also reunited with one of his reoccurring stars, Great Kelly, who turns in a great performance and is simply a wonderful presence on screen.",

            "content": "The first film of Hitchcock's Grace Kelly triplet marks what could be the graduation from his second tier to his first.  \n\nAdapted from a stage play, the story gallops along with all the unlikely brilliance of every enthralling detective story.  Suspenseful things happen in the film's apartment setting efficiently and without too much resistance.  Interestingly, due to the way certain events are arranged, the audience finds itself switching allegiances pretty nimbly and frequently.  In one scene, they might feel sympathy for Grace Kelly's charming character, while in another, they might suddenly hope that Anthony Dawson emerges from a compounding situation with minimal punishment.\n\nSimilarly to \"Rear Window,\" Grace Kelly definitely shows a bit of a spark in her performance.  I feel that she had a close working relationship with Hitchcock.  Hitchcock films featuring Grace Kelly click a bit more convincingly than those that don't.  John Williams is also very pleasing as the calmly brilliant Chief Inspector.\n\nThough the film's setting is predominantly in one place, the intrigue of the goings on never allow the audience an ounce of boredom.  Granted, \"Rear Window\" pulls off the single location trick much better, but the audience is not a prisoner, they are the passenger.  In terms of the traditional Hitchcock juiciness, the visceral apex of the film satisfies, especially of you feel the way I do about the characters.  The pacing is very economical, even seeming too quick in one moment.\n\nIn terms of costume, Grace Kelly might be the most sharply dressed woman in Hitchcock's filmography, though I'd love to entertain challenges to that claim.  The main flaw I noticed with the cinematography is somewhat suboptimal shadow management, but oh well.  The score was highly theatrical and nimble, as always.\n\nTwo films directly influenced by this one that I also enjoy are Terence Young's \"Wait Until Dark,\" featuring Audrey Hepburn and also based on a play and Matt Reeves' \"Let Me In,\" the American adaptation of the romantic horror novel.  They both manage to manipulate the sympathies of the audience multiple times over the course of the story, which makes for classic suspense.  While not quite on the spectacular level of Hitchcock's crown club, \"Dial M for Murder\" stands as an elegant jab, just short of the stratospheric peak of his decade of legend. (2 January 2013)",
