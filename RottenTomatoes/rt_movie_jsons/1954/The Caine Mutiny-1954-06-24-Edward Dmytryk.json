    "summary": "During World War II, a dilapidated vessel, the Caine, gets a new ensign, Willis Keith (Robert Francis), and a new captain, Commander Queeg (Humphrey Bogart). The crew sees Queeg's unconventional behavior as irrational, and communications officer Thomas Keefer (Fred MacMurray) spreads suspicion about his suitability as captain. When a dire situation during a storm forces the executive officer (Van Johnson) to relieve Queeg of his duties, he and Ensign Keith are tried for mutiny.",

But in the end we are supposed to think of those who hold him accountable as the bad ones, the \u2018heels\u2019, and rotten. They were supposed to give him their support instead of letting the military know how dangerous he was. I have asked several people from the military for an explanation, and none of them can come up with anything reasonable. Good acting though.",

            "content": "\"The Caine Mutiny\" is a glorious ode to the spirit of the navy, even as it intrepidly navigates a sinewy exploration of the boundaries between courage and cowardice as well as foolishness versus insanity. Bogart shines as the mercurial captain, although it is Fred MacMurray's performance as the supremely astute and yet unreservedly self-interested would-be writer that most captivates the attention. The film facilitates bold transitions from one context to the next, seamlessly blending harrowing maritime thrills with the pot-boiling tension of courtroom conflict. Intermingling between the catalyzing extremes of these themes is the gently lilting romantic drama between one key officer and his lady at home; a counterpoint to the action whose relevance acquires increasing clarity as the film pushes on. Seeing \"The Caine Mutiny\" amounts to a revelation of the sublime qualities of all of these actors' potentials, leaving us with no doubt that we'll be returning to the experience again; a little later, if not sooner.",

            "content": "\"Ah, but the strawberries! That's, THAT's where I had them.\"\n\nThough I have not read the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Herman Wouk that the film is based on, The Caine Mutiny remains a decent watch today because of its status as a character study; though he doesn't show up for some time (and is absent for long stretches of courtroom dialogue), it's Bogart's Lieutenant Commander Queeg that remains the complete focus of the film. While styled as the story's primary antagonist, he is actually a complex figure rather than a reincarnated William Bligh (of Mutiny on the Bounty infamy). His faults put others' lives at risk, but they are demonstrated to have originated out of a sense of duty and are subsequently fanned by the disrespect of those under his command in an unhealthy feedback loop. Simultaneously, he is hardly without sin as he tries to shift blame for his own erratic behavior onto others when it suits him and continues to maintain responsibility even when he comes to the realization that he might no longer be fit for his position. There are no wholly innocent parties in the affair. \n\nBut this adaptation has a fair bit of weight dragging it down. Apparently the original novel focused much more heavily on fresh-faced Ensign Keith (Robert Francis), but the studio's need to cut material left only the skeleton of a subplot with an on-shore girlfriend and a pretty thin amount of character development as he largely sidesteps the main conflict of the film. The movie also feels pretty fragmented between its naval action and courtroom components, handling each relatively well but showing some frayed edges where they meet up; the transition away from the typhoon (a crux of the film) is shockingly stark and quick. Still, the screenplay manages to fit in a great performance from Bogart as Queeg, particularly his iconic courtroom moment where it slowly dawns on him that he has slit his own throat through his babbling. It might not have the same recognition it once did, but it deserves to be reevaluated by pop culture.\n\nShoutout to an exceptional character performance from Tom Tully as the outwardly lax but world-wise former captain of the Caine, who departs before most of the narrative meat comes to the table but still walked away with an Academy Award nomination. He conveys that sense of tired authority that speaks from experience to a tee. (3.5/5)",

            "content": "I have realized over time that movie about men on boats, usually in the Navy, are just not for me as between this film and The Sand Pebbles (1966) I find it difficult to enjoy them. Both films employ an odd blend of slapstick humor and serious drama concerning moral ethics and the mental health of the characters at hand. The film is famous for being one of Humphrey Bogart's last big hits and provided him with his final Best Actor nomination as he gave the sort of over the top performance that he often resisted. Unfortunately a lot of the film is not dominated by Bogart but by Robert Francis who is a charisma vacuum and seems like an entirely unnecessary accessory to the story that the film wants to tell.\n\nWillie Keith, Robert Francis, enlists into the Navy and is assigned to the USS Caine which is highly disorganized and run by the casual William De Vriess, Tom Tully, who comes into conflict with Keith. The young man also has to maintain a relationship with attractive singer May Wynn, May Wynn, but finds it hard to continue his relationship with her as his overbearing mother, Katherine Warren, complicates matters. Keith retires and veteran Phillip Queeg, Humphrey Bogart, is brought on board to whip the men into shape but his strictness makes him unpopular with Lieutenant Steve Maryk, Van Johnson, and Lieutenant Tom Keefer, Fred MacMurray. He begins to blame the men for mistakes that he is made and during a storm Maryk leads a mutiny and takes control of the ship. The men are later court martialed for this action and they have clever lawyer Barney Greenwald, Jose Ferrer, defend them and attempt to prove Queeg's insanity. Queeg breaks down when put on the stand but Keefer refuses to admit his part in the mutiny and loses the trust of his peers.\n\nViewed at the time as a great technical achievement this film looks cheap by modern standards as the constant use of green screen and bland cinematography makes it look dated and does not add anything to a story set at sea. This may have been why the film earned many Academy Award nominations as it may have attracted the attention of members who worked on technical aspects of films. I am rarely overtaken with joy at seeing something that is only of value due to how difficult it was to make. Even The Sand Pebbles had more going for it as the blue tones that color the entire film were quite beautiful and the images of ships traveling through the night had a quiet beauty to them. This film is all browns and reds but it's use of Technicolor is not as precise as it should be as there are times where bright colors blend together to make a horrific image. If cinematographer Franz Planer had given the film a more distinctive look and stood out from the crowd of military films produced in the early 1950s I would have found something to praise in the film.\n\nOther issues with the film include all of the needless subplots as while I do not find the central story particularly compelling the film could have lost ten minutes by cutting out the romantic subplot. Wynn and Francis were sold as a real life couple at the time so I found it odd that they had so little chemistry in the film. She has a face similar to Jane Wyman but she does not have an ounce of her talent and as she breathily complains about his mother's influence on him I was bored to tears. I am a woman so I find romance more interesting than warfare but when it is so painfully neutered and contrived I derive no enjoyment from it.\n\nThere is also the strange inclusion of humor in a film that takes itself very seriously as we get a lot of jokes about vomit, pooh and pee. This infantile humor might have appealed to younger audiences that the film wanted to draw in but for adults it seems discordant with the story as a whole. This film drew in big crowds in the early 1950s but it has not endured in the way that other Bogart films have which may be because it is such a slog.",

            "content": "I have great interest in films that explore the complexity of military procedure. The fact that there is sometimes a splintering between doing what is morally right and strictly following orders is fascinating and also a little bit scary. In fact, one of my favorite films (A Few Good Men) is entirely about marines who might have made a poor choice when given an order that was wrong. The Caine Mutiny also explores this idea, and whenever they approach this debate I was enthralled. I wish they had arrived at this point of conflict earlier in the film, and then they had filled more of the movie with the courtroom proceedings, because that\u2019s when the story shines. I\u2019m all for establishing the characters, but things like the romance of an Ensign while on shore leave is so out of place in the context of everything else going on in the story, I wish they were left out. I also had some issues with how extreme Captain Queeg acted. It became a bit comical at times, and I wasn\u2019t sure how I was supposed to believe he ever earned a position as captain of a naval vessel. What makes all of this work is the cast. In anyone else\u2019s hands, I think Queeg would be too ridiculous to be real, but with Bogart you can buy it. He has a prickly demeanor and authoritative presence that you believe could intimidate all the other crew members on his ship. Fred MacMurray gave an unexpected performance here that I enjoyed a lot. His aloof personality at the beginning devolved into something more serious as things escalated, and it worked perfectly as they got to the climax. I also have to commend Jos\u00e9 Ferrer and E.G. Marshall for bringing a lot to the trial, as the two lawyers. There are some moments I enjoyed more than others in The Caine Mutiny, but in general I found it to be a solid movie I would gladly watch again.",

By the time The Caine Mutiny had been filmed Bogart's acting style had mellowed and matured considerably, like a fine wine I guess. Bogart doesn't try to steal the show as the pivotal Queege, instead he lays back and projects the isolation that. Queege must have elt as Captain. It's the story of a veteran WWII commander trying to impose his war value discipline on between wars, unseasoned officers. What is Queege's undoing is not his response to criticism of his own mistakes and his desire to discipline insubordination and malfeasance but the manner in which he responds. Outside o military liffe, many of the goings on that Queege tries to punish, would have been punishable as well. It's just that Queege losses his cool too often and that becomes his undoing. Bogart's over top acting style is perfect for the emotionally battle scarred Queege. Van Johnson and red MacMurray are equally good at conveying the young boys network new officers that seemed to develop on board what was, but eventually wouldn't be, Queege's ship. Supposedly the book and movie were based on a true story. It's another example, pioneered by Hemingway, o a bestseller being adapted to film.",

It wasn't all bad and from another perspective added layer to the film.\r\nHaving said all that the film shines in the courtroom drama portion at the end. Is it one of the greatest films ever made?

While It's apparent that the men and even other officers are weary of the new strict Captain, as time goes on and difficult situations arise, the story progresses into a look into the new Captain's mind and his resulting actions.  The officers begin to suspect that the Captain is paranoid and is making reckless and cowardly decisions.  He reaches out to the other officers, but by this point they are over him and his outcry for help.  When a typhoon coupled with the Captain's unwavering decision to let the ship flounder, the first officer is forced to take command himself and save the ship.  The first officer is put on trial along with the new officer Keith, for inciting mutiny on the ship.  This is where the film shifts and continues on as a courtroom drama and not so much an action/adventure film like the first half of the film.

I've seen all of his major hits yet it wasn't until I watched THE CAINE MUTINY ( Edward Dmytryk, Columbia, 1954) that I understood just how truly great Bogie was.  With the role of LCDR. Phillip Queeg, Bogie displays a sublime vulnerability that stretches beyond performance.  To me its as if Bogie is baring his soul, allowing us to see real pain, real emotion.  And this role drives THE CAINE MUTINY entirely.  In fact without Bogie's portrayal this film becomes just another piece of 50's fluff propaganda, serving to stoke a post war euphoria and rehabilitate an industry damaged by an ongoing struggle with it's identification with liberalism and suspected communist ties.  \n\nComing at the end of his career, the role of Queeg suits Bogie perfectly.  Queeg is the crusty veteran, having served his country well and faithfully through years of war service.  He is the ideal American man, never complaining, always doing his duty and sticking by the book.  But much like Bogie himself, the cracks are starting to show.  Within three years of the films release Bogie was gone and one could say to by the end of the court-martial so to was Queeg.  But this is where Bogie's portrayal is sublime.  His vulnerability and anguish make him relatable, they allow his audience to feel with Bogie/Queeg and though he plays the crusty old hard liner, we empathize.  I've always maintained that great acting allows audiences to empathize with characters regardless of deed or brutality.  Bogie playing Queeg is a perfect example of this.  It is easily the best performance I have ever seen from Bogie.\n\nAlso playing a role that transcends what audiences expected of him is Fred MacMurray in the role of LT Keefer.  Slimy and backstabbing, self serving to the end, LT Keefer is an excellent villain.  Admittedly I have never read the Herman Wouk novel which is the source of the film but it's twist on the title at the end of the film is very intriguing.  I want to know if Keefer truly is the author of THE CAINE MUTINY, and only by reading the novel will I be able to figure that one out.\n\nOne thing I can determine is that at the time of the films release the film is an obvious propaganda piece for the U.S. Military.  There is extensive use of actual war footage within the film and most assuredly there is a pro-military slant to the films overall message.  With the director being one of the infamous Hollywood Ten, I wonder if this was his shot at redemption, his way of rejoining the industry he obviously loved.  I guess I have more reading to undertake, figuring out just who Edward Dmytryk was and why he made this film.\n\nThe final thing that really impresses me with this film is a rather simple one.  I love when I am watching an older film for the first time and as I'm watching I see elements or entire sections of more contemporary films throughout the text I am viewing.  CRIMSON TIDE (Tony Scott, Hollywood Pictures, 1995) and A FEW GOOD MEN (Rob Reiner, Castle Rock, 1992) are two excellent films yet after having seen THE CAINE MUTINY they will never be the same.  How can I look at COL. Jessup (Jack Nicholson) or CAPT. Ramsey (Gene Hackman) without seeing Bogie playing Queeg?  And this solitary fact drives home to me finally just how great Bogie was.  Nicholson and Hackman are two of the very best ever to work in Hollywood, yet they owe something to Bogie.  He was truly a great!\n\nAnd so I must ask, what is your favorite Bogie role, and why?",

I want to know if Keefer truly is the author of THE CAINE MUTINY, and only by reading the novel will I be able to figure that one out.\n\nOne thing I can determine is that at the time of the films release the film is an obvious propaganda piece for the U.S. Military.  There is extensive use of actual war footage within the film and most assuredly there is a pro-military slant to the films overall message.  With the director being one of the infamous Hollywood Ten, I wonder if this was his shot at redemption, his way of rejoining the industry he obviously loved.  I guess I have more reading to undertake, figuring out just who Edward Dmytryk was and why he made this film.\n\nThe final thing that really impresses me with this film is a rather simple one.  I love when I am watching an older film for the first time and as I'm watching I see elements or entire sections of more contemporary films throughout the text I am viewing.  CRIMSON TIDE (Tony Scott, Hollywood Pictures, 1995) and A FEW GOOD MEN (Rob Reiner, Castle Rock, 1992) are two excellent films yet after having seen THE CAINE MUTINY they will never be the same.  How can I look at COL. Jessup (Jack Nicholson) or CAPT. Ramsey (Gene Hackman) without seeing Bogie playing Queeg?  And this solitary fact drives home to me finally just how great Bogie was.  Nicholson and Hackman are two of the very best ever to work in Hollywood, yet they owe something to Bogie.  He was truly a great!\n\nAnd so I must ask, what is your favorite Bogie role, and why?",

He just shows a deeply flawed man who almost got his entire crew killed.  And Jose Ferrer brilliantly portrays a defense lawyer who's about as frustrated with his defendant as he is with Bogart.\n\nExcellent film that deals with mental illness surprisingly well for a 1954 release.  \n\nSide-note: The theme of paranoia is picked up nicely in 1956's Invasion of the Body Snatchers...",

On the high seas during World War II the by-the-book Captain Queeg pushes his wary crew to the breaking point that will finally lead to a modern-day mutiny, after a series of questionable orders, Lieutenant Maryk, played by Van johnson in a solid performance confronts Queeg when he orders the ship to maintain its path directly into a deadly typhoon. Lt. Maryk invokes naval regulations and relieves Captain Queeg of his command forcing the crew to mutiny. Lt. Maryk is court-martialed for treason, an offense that could get him hanged. The film ends with the trail which is brilliantly intense and fascinating. The supporting performances are uniformly fine from a stellar cast that includes Jose Ferrer, Fred MacMurray, Robert Francis, May Wynn, Tom Tully, E.G. Marshall and a young Lee Marvin.  But it is Humphrey Bogart who owns this film and he is amazing giving one of the last great performances of his career, he conveys the sheer complexity of his character with his quirky mannerisms and tortured demeanor, his demand for perfection and his refusal to accept his own fallibility, this is truly an exceptional performance.

The love story subplot is entirely distracting and unnecessary - a Navy man, his fiance and some sort of Freudian mommy issues - and Robert Francis is just a big stiff as the central hero, Ensign Willy Keith. The role would have been right in the wheelhouse of Montgomery Cliff, or, say, Tony Perkins, but instead it was given to an expressionless bag of bolts like Mr. Francis. (The Mafia was probably involved in his casting. They ran everything in the fifties, didn't they?)\r\n\r\nAlso, according to Wikipedia, director Edward Dmytryk thought this thing should have been even longer, 3-4 hours long. Well, sorry there Dmytryk, but you need to lay off the potato vodka because that's just crazy talk. I don't know much about the book - apparently it's one of those epic '50s door stops - but this movie is too slow as it is. It needed twenty minutes lopped off. \r\n\r\nI still give it five stars though because it has my favorite Humphrey Bogart performance. He's jumpy and unnerving as the authoritarian Captain Queeq - constantly fidgeting with his metal ball bearings - and he's sympathetic. He's not a villian even if you do side with the mutineers. When this picture concentrates on the mutiny and it's aftermath, and the camera twists its lens to Bogart, it is tense and challenging. \r\n\r\nJose Ferrer, Fred MacMurray and Van Johnson are all excellent. This movie needed a sharper focus, and a more interesting actor than Robert Francis to anchor it, but it's still pretty damn great.

Fred MacMurray, in his heel mode, is excellent as the undermining Keefer, and Van Johnson effectively combines doubt and sincerity as Maryk. Robert Francis, who makes a solid debut as the real hero, Willie Keith, but he was killed in a plane crash after making only three films. Tom Tully managed an Oscar nomination for his unremarkable role as a war-weary captain, but the honors really go to Bogart, who's never less than believable as the well-meaning captain who cannot bear the pressures of command and of a doubting crew. Jose Ferrer, as the lawyer who defends the mutineers, is quite impressive as well (more deserving of an Oscar nod than Tully), and his final drunken speech is shocking and effecitve. Short appearances by E.G. Marshall and Lee Marvin are the icing on the cake. Edward Dmytryk's direction is just right. The only let-down is Max Steiner's flagwaving score, which seems too simplistic for this complex story. As Hollywood classics go, this one deserves to be more widely seen.",

And I know this is regarded as a great movie, with Oscar-worthy performances by a gaggle of household names.  But after sitting through it from start to finish for the first time, I'm not quite sure what all the hoopla was about.\r\n\r\nWe follow Ensign Willis Keith, played by Robert Francis, from his graduation, and on to his first assignment, the minesweeper Caine.  He thinks his first commanding officer is bad, until his second one arrives.  That would be the thoroughly paranoid and apparently gun-shy Captain Queeg, played wonderfully by Humphrey Bogart.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the cast, er, crew, slowly become aware of Queeg's apparent mental condition through a number of incidences, among them the \"yellow stain\" affair, and the case of the missing strawberries.  All of this eventually leads his officers to remove him from command during a typhoon, which is the first time his mental state could actually get them all killed.\r\n\r\nThe movie wraps up with a trial on the mutiny charges, and then an emotional encounter between the defense lawyer, played expertly by Jose Ferrer, and the officers of the Caine, sans Queeg.\r\n\r\nMost of the film is interesting enough, and it is quite fun watching Bogart pull of his paranoid, obsessive character.  And the final scene provides an excellent editorial on the entire affair, thanks to great performances by Ferrer and the esteemed Fred McMurray.  But the trial, aside from Bogart\u0092s great meltdown, is rather silly.  Also, I never quite figured out the whole romance angle that was provided  for our lead, Ensign Keith, as well as the relationship he had with his doting mother.  Francis, in fact, is rather weak and robotic throughout.\r\n\r\nSolid performances by Ferrer, Bogart, and McMurray make this film memorable, especially the aforementioned meltdown scene, and the champaign-tossing finale.

As the story begins the ship's captain (Bogart) has become increasingly paranoid as a result of battle fatigue. When the ship runs into a storm the officers are torn as to what action to take as the captain becomes more and more isolated and possibly a danger to the ship and crew. \r\n\r\nThe film was well directed by Edward Dmytryk who had made several very good noir films and received an Oscar nomination for Crossfire. This was a comeback for Dmytryk though as he had been one of Senator Joseph McCarthy's Hollywood Ten and was not only blacklisted but also imprisoned for Contempt of Congress. \r\n\r\nOne of the most impressive aspects of the film is the utterly convincing Humphrey Bogart who is cast completely against type as the deteriorating Captain Queeg. The remainder of the cast including Fred MacMurray, Jose Ferrer, Van Johnson, Tom Tully and E.G. Marshall give good performances but nothing like the performance by Bogart.\r\n\r\nThe film was based on the Pulitzer Prize winning novel by Herman Wouk.\r\n\r\nThe film would be nominated for seven Academy Awards, although it would win none. The film was also a huge commercial success.\r\n\r\nAt the insistence of the Department of Defense the titles at the begining of the film tell us there has never been a mutiny upon an American Navy vessel. The studio agreed to this as they needed the cooperation of the Navy in providing the vessels on which much of the action was filmed.",

Knowing that The Caine Mutiny would be Kramer's final film for the company, Columbia Pictures president Harry Cohn made sure the budget on The Caine Mutiny was cut to the absolute bone, and took the chance that Bogart's name, coupled with the popularity of the book, would ensure a hit film. From such a financial and creative straightjacket, a great film was made, mostly by virtue of Edward Dmytryk's direction and some excellent central performances: not just Humphrey Bogart's tired, troubled Lt. Comdr. Queeg, but also Van Johnson as the well-meaning but ultimately foolhardy first officer Lt. Maryk; Robert Francis as the na\u00c3\u00afve and very foolish Ensign Keith; Fred MacMurray as the glib-tongued, manipulative Lt. Keefer; and Jose Ferrer as the unwilling defense attorney Barney Greenwald, who achieves a victory that has nothing to do with justice, right and wrong, or truth. Bogart gives one of his finest late-career performances, calling up the same mixture of bravado, fear, and irrationality that informed his performance as Fred C. Dobbs in John Huston's The Treasure of the Sierra Madre six years before, crawling with little neurotic affects that make him startling to watch. Coupled with MacMurray's smooth-talking treacherousness and Johnson's stalwart performance, plus Francis' bright-eyed, bushy-tailed enthusiasm, the characters make for a memorable and compelling two-hour-plus dramatic experience.",

The casting is perfect, both the stars (Humphrey Bogart, Fred MacMurray, Jose Ferrier) and the relative newcomers (Van Johnson, Robert Francis) all hold their own. The court scenes are riveting, and the scenes aboard the actual ship, the Caine, are excellent and hold the viewers attention. The only quibbles that can be had with the movie are the romantic side-plot (which seems a bit tacked on, however not so much as to be annoying) and the quite obvious splicing in of the WWII footage (which can be forgiven given that the movie WAS made in 1954, without the advantages we have today with film restoration etc.) What is really great about the movie is that although these and a couple other flaws do exist, the rest of it is SO good that it easily makes up for it. The tension is palpable throughout the whole film, and the cinematography is perfectly fitting. Of special mention is Humphrey Bogart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance, easily the best I have ever seen of his. Throughout he is nothing like the Casablanca or Maltese Falcon roles with which he made his stardom, but is quivering, nervous, and beaten down, but NEVER over the top. The scene in the courtroom where he begins to break down is Oscar-worthy. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great film, with intrigue, tension, courtroom drama, and romance, recommendable to anyone.\r\n\r\nBEST SCENE- The courtroom scene which focuses on Captain Queeg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s testimony is easily the best in the film. It is as riveting as it is tense. Humphrey makes you feel sympathy for him as well as feeling that he is indeed not fit to command a ship, which is what the movie hinges on.",

Only his performance in \"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,\" one of Hollywood\u0092s best-ever, was better. And, yes, I did watch \"Casablanca.\"[/size]\n \n[size=1]Bogart\u0092s outstanding acting makes the movie\u0092s gripping scenes even more compelling. The best scene is his falling apart on the witness stand \u0096 a sort of subdued version of Jack Nicholson\u0092s memorable breakdown in \"A Few Good Men.\" The other great scenes were when Van Johnson takes over command of the ship as Bogart vacillates during a typhoon and the hunt for the missing strawberries.[/size]\n \n[size=1]Throughout \"Caine,\" the writers do a good job of showing how Bogart\u0092s Captain Queeg is an incompetent officer and one of those petty jerks everybody hates \u0096 a compulsive authoritarian who tries to make up for his lack of substance by focusing on rules so he is always right and everyone else is wrong.[/size]\n \n[size=1]The confrontation between Bogart and his subordinates, the disputes between the officers about what to do about Queeg, the transformation of the Van Johnson character, and the canniness and cowardice of the Fred MacMurray character are also positive elements in the movie.[/size]\n \n[size=1]All this makes the ending absolutely infuriating. Jose Ferrer\u0092s speech is beyond ludicrous. It\u0092s based on two premises \u0096 MacMurray was the brains behind the mutiny and the mutiny was unjustified. Half the movie is about MacMurray laying the groundwork for the mutiny so Ferrer\u0092s conclusion is news only to himself.[/size]\n \n[size=1]The second premise is just dumb. Bogart had acted incompetently and cowardly at sea twice before the typhoon \u0096 and blamed others for his mistakes. Ferrer\u0092s declaration that Johnson would not have had to act against Bogie during the typhoon if officers had months earlier accepted their captain\u0092s plea for help \u0096 and Johnson agreeing with Ferrer \u0096 makes no sense. Lives were in danger during the typhoon. Period.[/size]\n \n[size=1]The conclusion has the stench of U.S. Navy censorship.[/size]\n \n[size=1]I noticed that many IMDb posters rip the romance between the young officer and his girlfriend. This is interesting since there are countless 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s movies with unconvincing romances that appear to be patronizing attempts to win over female viewers, and many of those romances are barely criticized.[/size]\n \n[size=1]The romance in this movie is less distracting and time-consuming than many others. At least I can see what the writers were trying to do \u0096 make us interested in the young officer so we viewers care about what happens to him later on. This works up to a point. It ultimately does NOT work -- not because the romance is uninteresting, but because the officer\u0092s character is NOT developed. He is an uninteresting observer for most of \"Caine,\" and he is a milquetoast when he takes stands on principle later in the film.[/size]\n \n[size=1]Robert Francis\u0092 lack of development in \"Caine\" compares unfavorably to the transformations of Jack Lemmon and Charlie Sheen in \"Mister Roberts\" and \"Platoon.\" It doesn\u0092t help that Francis is not a good actor.[/size]\n \n[size=1]The writers should have spent more time developing Francis\u0092 character instead of using 35 minutes before Bogart enters the movie or they should have downplayed Francis and focused on Van Johnson instead.[/size]\n \n[size=1]I gave \"Caine\" a 7.[/size]\n \n[size=1]ZWrite[/size]\n \n[size=1]By the way, nominating the actor who played Queeg\u0092s predecessor instead of MacMurray for a Best Supporting Oscar is preposterous.[/size]",

I'm a big Bogart fan, so naturally I wanted to see it. Also, one of my favorite bands -- Project 86 -- has an awesome song entitled \"The Kane Mutiny,\" so I definitely wanted to check it out to see if there was any sort of connection between the two. After seeing the film, I don't see a whole lot of similarity between Schwab's song lyrics and the film's story, but I'm very glad I watched it nonetheless.\n\n\"The Caine Mutiny\" starts off a little slow, but it continually picks up the pace as it goes along. What ensues is a fine WWII story of several of the seamen aboard the Caine wrestling with the decision of whether or not to take control of the ship on grounds of the captain's incompetence and mental instability.\n\nEven in a limited role, Bogart steals the show with his amazing performance as the paranoid Captain Queeg. I had already witnessed his fine performances in classics like \"Casablanca,\" \"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,\" and \"The Maltese Falcon,\" but the character he creates here feels completely fresh as he manages to disappear into the role completely. In fact, it's such an impressive performance that I would rank it up there with all of those classic aforementioned roles. His Captain Queeg is not nearly as glamorous as his Rick Blaine in \"Casablanca\" or his detective Sam Spade in \"The Maltese Falcon,\" but Bogart's atypical performance here is part of what makes it work so well.",

The film is solidly cast from Bogart?s menacing Captain Queeg to Jose Ferrer?s Lt. Barney Greenwald who sees things quite clearly all the way to Fred MacMurray?s Lt. Thomas 'Tom' Keefer who has a lot more depth to him than originally let on. MacMurray thrived in the Disney company playing good guys, but I think his forte is playing the anti-hero, a villain, because he has the good face, but the conniving element to him. The plot goes that the first officer, played by virtuous Van Johnson, relieves tyrannical Captain Queeg of command during a critical time in a storm fearing for the health of the ship. In the process this act creates an uproar in the fleet because it appears to mutiny. The first officer is put on trial and is defended by crafty Lt. Barney Greenwald. Its glue is a masterful performance from an aged Humphrey Bogart much like how he did another daring role in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre except he was not overshadowed by a father and son duo in this film and thus was allowed to shine during his time in this film. I enjoyed the film before reading the novel, but found it be even greater after reading the fantastic Herman Wouk novel because of how well adapted it was, staying quite close to the novel, but also editing the extraneous stuff to focus the story. One of the best war dramas to not feature a battle of any sort.",

He hits all the right marks and leads you to dislike him and side with the conspirators and then ads a dimension of frailty as we watch his character break down under the stress of age and relentless attack on trail. You actually end up sympathizing with him which in turn ads a dimension of morality to the whole story.\nFerrer's attacking professional cool defense lawyer is the perfect foil and is merciless in his attacks on Bogart. Cool calculating young with no misgivings about what he has to do to defend his clients. Especially good is the post trail drunken dressing down he gives his clients! It lifts his character and  enhances the underlying morality play which runs through this whole story.\nWell written and taunt overall I have only one beef which prevents me from giving this flick a full five stars, and that is a stupid convoluted love story which is dropped into the middle of this movie. It doesn't play well and I think it was just some studio executives lame idea to make Robert Francis into a heartthrob. Not only can't he act but the whole love story just doesn't fit and detracts from the pacing of movie.

Granted the greatness of the film holds Bogart's usual ease and masterful stroke accountable. The Pulitzer Prize winning novel was a bit controversial as was this picture for portraying a mutiny upon a U.S Naval Commanding Officer which they are sure to remind us in the beginning title cards that a mutiny has never happened in the U.S Navy before. \r\n\r\nThere are many comical and memorable scenes. Most of which involve Bogart who doesn't show up until 30 minutes into the film. The most famous of course being the court held on which crew member ate the remaining strawberries. The Caine Mutiny is an exceptionally casted war film that investigates the psychological effects of war on soldiers more so than the actual battles themselves.",

I'm willing to cut the director some slack because he had just gotten out of jail (he was one of the infamous \"Hollywood Ten\" who were thrown in jail for not cooperating with Joe McCarthy's \"House of UnAmerican Activity\"... which helps understand why he chose to direct this film.)\r\n\r\nThe story is about a paranoiac ship commander played by Bogart who's mental illness leads to a mutiny on the ship. The casting for this film was completely idiotic. Robert Francis (who received something akin to NINTH BILLING) plays the role of green Ens. Willis Keith... why most of the movie revolves around him... when he has zero acting talent, is not one of the films stars, and his character is ultimately only of minor consequence to the story... is beyond me.\r\n\r\nWhy not have a bit more history of the ship and its crew? How about some flashback scenes to Bogart's character before he cracked up? What about a commercial for Sanka instead of watching this loser blunder his role?\r\n\r\nThese are the lapses in judgement that ended James Cameron's career and nearly brought down Leo DiCaprio with him (The Departed couldn't have come soon enough.) You can't give too much credit to script writers... since the film is simply based on a best-selling novel. And you have to question the director's execution of pivotal scenes.\r\n\r\nIt's the intelligent performance of every other character in this film that makes this a semi classic. I especially liked Tom Tully's portrayl as Commander DeVriess, The Caine's captain until Bogart takes over. This isn't really a \"Bogart film\" in the classical sense. Bogart has the least amount of screen time in the entire film. But he and Fred MacNamara are clearly the only real stars in the film.\r\n\r\nI could go into detail about the difference between a simple actor and a star... but watching this film in it's entirety would make that difference plain. This is contrary to Bogart's biggest films (The Maltese Falcon and Casablanca)where EVERYBODY was a star (Peter Lorre, the star of \"M\", and Sydney Greenstreet, a legend in his own right, were in both movies). The Caine Mutiny is a perfect example of a movie with one star, a bunch of really good character actors, and a hunk of dead meat right in the middle.\r\n\r\nFor all that it's a must-see if only because it completely redefined popular culture by influencing everything from The Hunt to Red October and A Few Good Men to The Simpsons (\"There's three ways of doing things: The Right Way, The Wrong Way, and the Max Power Way.\" -Homer \"There's four ways of doing things: The Right Way, The Wrong Way, The Navy Way, and MY Way. If we do things my way we'll get along just fine.\" -Bogart.)",

Don't be fooled to think of him as a one-dimensional actor, always playing the private detective in noir films.  This movie proves that he was indeed a versatile actor.  Fred MacMurray also delivered a strong performance (worth mentioning), while Robert Francis...so-so.

Despite a few slight drawbacks, I did enjoy the movie. Let's start with the bad stuff. A tad too patriotic for my taste, but aren't most American films ( especially from that period). I was also rather unimpressed by Robert Francis (whose career was ended by a plane crash too soon) who had the uncherished role of playing straight-hand to a square crew. His character serves as the axis for the audiences to be latched onto in order to follow the events on the USS Caine, yet, his character remains colourless and bleak, so does the performance. Bogart and MacMurray on the other hand are marvelous as always. It is a rare treat - even in modern films - to find characters so ambigious and that make it hard to decide whether you want to love or hate them, and here are two of them on one fancy reel of celluloid. Van Johnson does a good job as well, never saw him in a film before, I hope this wont be my last. Reading up on the background of its production, I learned that the film was supposed to be much longer ( i.e. - closer to the book) and it shows, the first third of the book feels utterly unnecessary when it comes to the storytelling of the film itself (the twist at the end being the exception), hence, it takes the film quite a while to start rolling in the deep and I wish they would have cut to the chase much sooner and make the tension last longer instead of bringing on the finale so swiftly. But what a finale it is. I am a sucker for courtroom drama, who isn't, and this one is carried beautifully by the actors and Bogart helming the class by a mile, great performance by the legend. All in all .... a tense and well-crafted film that could have been a tad better with a stronger lead and a script bold enough to let the literary original be just that and focus on what works on film.

A Ship's Captain is removed from his command by his Executive Officer in an apparent outright act of mutiny. As the trial of the mutineers unfold, it is then learned that the Captain of the ship was mentally unstable, perhaps even insane. The Navy must then decide: was the Caine Mutiny a criminal act? Or an act of courage to save a ship from destruction at the hands of her Captain. \n[b][size=3]A military & courtroom drama classic starring Humphrey Bogart.  The film is well cast with good performances all around.  At times the movie had a hard time holding my interest, too many long shots of the ships at sea, and military practices I found boring to watch, but the central storyline about a group of disgruntled men under a commander that increasingly shows signs of mental unstability and eventually work together to topple his role as leader was interesting.  Yet the story doesn't oversimplify the charactors, in the end we see that errors in judgement were also made by the mutineers, who in  their own ways let their captain down.[/size][/b]",

Perhaps it's because she was in a film called Mutiny, which was made a few years before this. Also, the film was released in 1954, not 1952. Anyway, now those gripes are out of the way, The Caine Mutiny is an excellent story and an excellent film, and as the paranoid Captain Queeg Humphrey Bogart gives one of his greatest performances. I found the little 'romantic interludes' in the film unnecessary and they took away from the intense atmosphere of a ticking time bomb, but overall the film was well directed and well acted, and by all accounts the novel was worthy of its Pulitzer Prize. The typhoon scenes are very authentic for their day, the courtroom scenes couldn't have been much better and the incident with the strawberries is genius.",

Cutting away to officers Van Johnson (blue collar sensible) and Fred MacMurray (smarmy cynic) looking at each other and their fellow crew members, we immediately sense that Queeg might not be the right man for the job. As the captain obsesses over a missing quart of strawberries and tears the entire ship upside down in search of an imaginary key to the freezer, their doubts increase; and by the time he is heading their boat straight into a typhoon, they've had enough. The second half of the picture follows the subsequent trial, where the so-called mutineers defend their actions as the viewer wonders if Queeg will crack up on the witness stand. It's all put together in what we might call \"solid\" fashion. It's old-fashioned storytelling with a slight psychological twist, and standard three-act drama. But as Queeg tells his men in a laundry list of professional conduct: \"Excellent performance is standard, standard performance is substandard.\" The Caine Mutiny is not distinctive filmmaking or storytelling, and its idea of ethical debate is relying on familiar archetypes and arguments. It sure is standard, though. It's like the well-constructed house that's not meant to be distinctive, but was made to endure. \n\nBogart started out his career playing nervous villains sweating their way through packs of cigarettes as they waited for their bad karma to catch up with them. Nearing the end of his career (and his life), Bogart finds a little of that cowardly rat in Queeg. Yet he also finds a militant forcefulness in this role, bringing to it some of the world-weariness of Rick from Casablanca, minus the ideological code and veiled idealism. And, on top of that, he layers on some exhausted sense of pathos: \"The captain's job is a lonely one,\" he sighs during a more paternal moment with the new ensign (young would-be star Robert Francis). Bogart was not just one of the great movie stars, but also one of the great actors. The Caine Mutiny surrounds him with other compelling players, such as the effortlessly authentic Johnson?every bit as good a character actor as Bogart, minus the charisma of a star. MacMurray, so dull when playing good guys, really comes to life when playing a fast-talking sneak. Rounding out the respectable cast is Jose Ferrer's efficient, sardonic defense attorney. The main reason the film still excites today is because it offers the chance to see some of the finest studio actors working at the top of their game. The entire subgenre of WWII-era studio pictures at sea were never really about the boats, or even about the seafaring way of life. They were about the stars, and The Caine Mutiny is, as Queeg suggests, carried above the level of \"standard\" by its excellent performances.",
