    "summary": "Dockworker Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) had been an up-and-coming boxer until powerful local mob boss Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb) persuaded him to throw a fight. When a longshoreman is murdered before he can testify about Friendly's control of the Hoboken waterfront, Terry teams up with the dead man's sister Edie (Eva Marie Saint) and the streetwise priest Father Barry (Karl Malden) to testify himself, against the advice of Friendly's lawyer, Terry's older brother Charley (Rod Steiger).",

As we follow Malloy down the labyrinthine avenue of his tormented conscience, we may feel as though cinema has traversed such a familiar route before, yet it can be argued that it has never done so more effectively or compellingly than what we see here. Brando dramatizes his internal conflict through the smoldering action of performance, rather than through the distilled convention of words, and the resulting tension mingles with a persistent empathy for the character that is certain to hold our attention until the film's grandly-stated final sequences. \"On the Waterfront\" is thus a film to be treasured; reminding us time and again of the complex richness that a film-viewing experience can offer.",

Schulberg's writings covered a curious variety of topics from corruption within the fight game \u2018The Harder They Fall'  to the plunder of bird plumage in \u2018Wind Across the Everglades' - even taking a serious shot at Media and the promotion of corrupt charlatans as \u2018hero's' with \u2018A face In The Crowd'.  In his early war years, Schulberg also gathered evidence for the Nuremberg trials - not one to hold back on the trail of inhuman activities.  \n\nAdding immeasurably to the power of \u2018Waterfront' were the towering talents of Composer Leonard Bernstein - creating a haunting musical soundscape that gave life to the settings and soul-searching torment of its characters. Performances, guided by Kazan, were career cementing for Brando, Eva Marie Saint (introducing), and Karl Malden, along with a hand-picked cast of powerhouse support players all destined for solid careers.  The violence portrayed within this picture was not simply sensationalistic, as it was for many that tried to copy \u2018waterfront' but rather to make a statement against violence, in an effort to bring justice into a corrupt institution.  It still packs a wallop today as it did 70yrs ago. Boris Kaufman's striking B/W cinematography (\u2018Patterns' 56) adds considerable visual power. \n\nThe Columbia DVD features a good image and sound transfer and I'm sure will have since been remastered in HD.",

Leonard Bernstein's score is way too loud and jarring, though.  And historically, one is a little uneasy about a movie directed by Elia Kazan with the central theme of \"informing,\" given that Kazan had just famously informed to the vile House Unamerican Activities Committee, ratting out Hollywood colleagues. And I could have done without the role of Karl Malden as the heroic, pious priest. That role was based on a real social-action Jesuit priest who crusaded for workers on the waterfront, but Malden plays him as a combination of Pat O'Brien and Red Skelton.

Marlon Brando may have single-handedly changed to face of film acting with his portrayal of Terry Malloy, a dock worker affiliated with the corrupt longshoreman's union.  Implicated in a murder that was carried out by the union, he struggles over the course of the film to manage his conscience, alternating between anguish, guilt, anger and disillusionment.  Brando's performance is staggering and overshadows great performances by Karl Malden, Rod Steiger, and Lee J. Cobb.  On the Waterfront is powerful storytelling with countless memorable scenes and characters.  The only negative might be the score.

Given how powerfully it affected me in 2020, I can only imagine the impact it had on viewers in 1954! There are many things to appreciate about this film. For instance, Marlon Brando puts on a clinic in method acting. His Terry Malloy is utterly fleshed out in every mannerism and utterance. Also, the many intimate scenes, rendered in gorgeous chiaroscuro lighting, between characters bursting under the weight of buried pain and frustration, are all examples of great cinematic storytelling.      But THE ONE THING that replays in my mind, after this viewing, is the use of the passion of Christ as the narrative device to bring this story of redemption to its climax. It's especially striking because in all other respects, the story is very contemporary. It tells the tale of our hapless hero's participation in the mob's infiltration of the waterfront longshoreman's union. Then, Terry gradually comes to face to face with his conscience and bears witness against the thugs. Through his subsequent physical suffering, he is ennobled to the status of messiah, cleansing the waterfront of sin, and restoring honesty and integrity to the workplace. It's a great example of how the use of a mythical framework can raise the import and impact of regular story.",

Meanwhile, he dates a woman (Eva Marie Saint) whose brother died from the hands of the union and is in torment. From here, Terry falls into a moral crisis and must decide whether to fight against his corrupt organization or give in. Before Elia Kazan made this film, he blacklisted people in the film industry who were presumed Communists during the McCarthy Era. This act cost the many friendships of producers, playwrights, and actors. As such, the tribulations and frustrations are reflected in the script of On the Waterfront, with Terry's side with the crime world symbolizing Kazan's past as a former Communist in New York. Terry's choice to redeem himself in court and rebel against Joe Friendly parallels Kazan's choice to testify against his friends at the McCarthy Trials. The dead pigeons symbolizes Kazan's weakening film career. Even Father Barry (Karl Malden), the one who inspired him to wise up and go along with the right side, bears an uncanny resemblance to Senator Joseph McCarthy. On the Waterfront is a naturalistic, direct retelling of the director's account with one of the most vivid milestone events in the 20th Century. \n\n(5 Pigeons out of 5)",

That's fine, cool, good, but then he dates the dead man's sister (Eva Marie Saint), who suspects Malloy of knowing more about the death than he puts-off? This was strange and seemed like a way to throw an unnecessary love story sub-plot into a film that didn't need it. The relationship between Malloy and Johnny, and between Malloy and his brother, Charley, was more than enough to drive the story. I mean, that cab ride with Malloy and Charley (of course, had to rewind the \"I coulda been a contender\" line a few times) is heartbreaking. That, along with the way Malloy is ostracized for doing the right thing, despite how difficult it would be. My couple of criticisms would be how easily Malloy just walked in and out of places with a gun while searching for Johnny, as if his goons wouldn't've drawn their own and how Johnny kinda beat Malloy in fisticuffs. Yeah, Johnny got some help there, but come on, Malloy is an ex-prize-fighter at least 10\u201315 years his junior. On the Waterfront is American cinema canon and definitely merits a view from aficionados and casual viewers alike.",

Brando is much the same; he is almost ubiquitously pictured as his characters in the Godfather or Streetcar Named Desire, despite several other excellent performances. Both of these are a real shame, because the film is a force to be reckoned with, combining simple yet profound character development with top-notch camerawork. It seems that Kazan's direction stems from a persecution complex as a result of his conduct during the McCarthy days, rather than any sort of dedication to the medium,but you can't deny the results. While Brando gets most of the credit, Cobb is electric and seizes the screen every time he makes an appearance. (4.5/5)",

            "content": "In 1955, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences awarded the Oscar for Best Picture to On the Waterfront. The film is a barefaced look inside a corrupted mob-infested union that rules over the local dock workers.\n\nThe local union boss is Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb). Through discriminatory daily hiring, threats, intimidation and outright murder, he maintains complete control over the local union workers. Friendly's accountant and man Friday is Charley Malloy (Rod Steiger). Charley's brother is local dock worker Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando). Terry had been a boxer of admitted skill and technique who, at his brother's request, reluctantly lost fights so the Johnny Friendly could win on bets against him.\n\nThe movie begins as Terry is unwittingly duped into setting up the circumstances so that Friendly's goons can murder local dock worker Joey Doyle. Unbeknownst to Terry, Joey was going to testify before the Waterfront Crime Commission against Friendly. After Joey is killed, Terry begins a relationship with Joey's sister Edie (Eva Marie Saint). The relationship brings about a self-awakening for Terry as he begins to question the status quo, his own failings, and his potential to redeem himself from some of his previous choices in life. To help him along this journey is the local waterfront priest, Father Barry (Karl Malden).\n\nMarlon Brando plays Terry's simplicity and self revelation to sheer perfection. His performance would deservedly win the Oscar for Best Actor. This movie contains the iconic speech Brando is well known for, as Terry ruminates over the life his brother forced on him. \"I coulda' had class. I coulda' been a contender. I could've been somebody\". For himself, for Edie, and for all the dock workers he represents, he must now determine if indeed, if he could still \"be somebody\".\n\nThe superb acting and gripping story are impeccably enhanced by the cinematography of the tri-state area docksides, rooftops, bars and lower income residential areas. Equally deserving of praise is Leonard Berstein's amazing score. The movie opens not with a full orchestra ushering in the credits, but with a solitary brass instrument, setting the stage for Terry's lone journey. Cleverly, the music is also often employed jarringly in contrast with what is playing out. Rather than accompany the scene, the music is setting up the transition about to occur. I found it brilliant.",

Marlon Brando is very natural and raw. He is very watchable as he fights the system before walking triumphantly. The look of the movie is very dark, smoky and very evocative.  You can understand why this film won many Oscars and with Brando most deserving. Eva Maria Saint is a little underused but plays important role giving Brandos character love and support that he is lacking. The scene where the two brothers chat in the taxi is gone down in history but still packs a punch. Brando looking at where his life could have been instead being a bum. The violence and murders are very shocking and surprised me. From the man on a hanger through to Brandos character getting beat up left nothing to the imaginative. The men are beat up everyday by turning the other cheek or not working from day to day. The violent union mob are in control and get out of line and you'll not live to tell the tale, but if all men fight together then who's in control. Great direction by Elia Kazan allowing the actors to impress but also through the great camera work of the docks and places they live. Its a dark and moody place to work and live. With great cinematography through the New Jersey locations shooting on location. A film a punch above the rest.",

            "content": "On the Waterfront is best known for Marlon Brando's performance and the \"Contender\" scene in particular; his work here is widely seen as an exemplar of method acting. But whilst the praise heaped on Brando is deserved, he isn't the only thing that makes this a great film.\nThe story is a crime drama about mobster Johnny Friendly's dockside operations and Father Barry's quest to bring him to justice, for which he requires Terry Molloy's testimony. The plot however is Terry's, as he goes from pigeon keeping dockworker and occasional mob stooge to a man seeking redemption once he falls in love with Edie, whose brother he helped lure to his death. On the Waterfront has been described as a melodrama, and in the sense that it focuses on plot at the expense of character, that is arguably true. Karl Malden's Father Barry, convincingly acted though he is, remains little more than a priest with a strong sense of morality. Johnny Friendly is a one-dimensional mob boss. And so on. These characters are barely sketched and come alive purely because of the actors. Terry \u2013 with his past as a prize fighter, his work for Friendly and his fondness for his pigeons \u2013 is the only real exception. But as in any good melodrama, these characters serve the story perfectly, and it's easy to see why Budd Schulberg won the Academy Award for Best Screenplay.\nThe story is also not as simple as it seems, or at least it isn't as predictable as one might expect. It often confounds audience expectations, themselves conditioned by years of crime dramas. For example, Terry does not shoot Friendly (Father Barry talks him out of it), but defeats him by other means, first by testifying against him in court and then by furiously defying him at the docks, taking a beating and still getting back to his feet; the result is that the dockworkers turn on Friendly and throw him into the river. The film's climax has notoriously been seen as director Eliz Kazan's justification of his testimony in front of the House Committee on Un-American Activities (Lindsay Anderson described the ending as \"fascist\") but it provides a fitting end to the narrative. Indeed the final scene is a triumph, as the camera follows a battered and bloody Terry proudly leading his fellow workers into the warehouse, whilst Barry and Edie look on and the dishevelled Friendly rants impotently.\nMarlon Brando is indeed impressive here. He brings his famously naturalistic acting style to the role of Terry and makes it his own. If Brando's acting seems visible, it's only because generations of cinema fans have spent years examining what he's actually doing. That shouldn't distract us from the fact that he is entirely believable as Terry from his first scene, and he's electrifying in the scenes that everybody tends to wax lyrical about, including the Contender scene. He's notable too when Terry is gradually getting to know Edie, showing her his pigeons and almost shyly opening up to her about his past. Later, when he tells Edie that he'd like to help her but can't, the audience believes him. Terry's scenes with Edie as they gradually become closer are crucial to the plot \u2013 they have to convince us, since they relationship is the catalyst for his decision to betray Friendly, despite the risk he faces in doing so. This is particularly important because Terry is very much an anti-hero in a film from a time when these weren't common in mainstream Hollywood cinema \u2013 he's basically a small time crook convinced to do the right thing as much as by his attraction to Edie and revenge for his brother's murder as by Father Barry's appeals to his conscience.\nWhilst Brando is undoubtedly the star, there are excellent performances too from Karl Malden as Father Barry, Eva Marie Saint as Edie Doyle, Lee J. Cobb as Friendly, and Rod Steiger as Charley. Steiger was just as much of a method actor than Brando and arguably more versatile, whilst Malden's impassioned performance as Father Barry is no less impressive than Brando's as Terry. All of the bit players convince, the likelihood being that Kazan wouldn't have accepted anything else; indeed, in search of naturalism, he cast former professional boxers as some of Friendly's heavies. \nLots of factors make On the Waterfront deserving of its classic status. They include Leonard Bernstein's economically used, often discordant, deliberately jarring score, which becomes increasingly prominent after the taxi cab scene as the film starts to build to a climax. Then there's Boris Kaufman's cinematography, with his use of the low- and high-angle shots that help Kazan to exploit the often claustrophobic locations to maximum effect. It's a very visual film, with creative camerawork and almost noir-ish lighting. The use of sound is masterful: there's a fascinating scene in which Terry confesses his part in Joey's murder to Edie, but we don't hear it because the dialogue is drowned out by a ship's horn; the meaning of the scene is conveyed by Brando and Saint's facial and physical expressions. There are innumerable other small details \u2013 the costumes are one, the clothing worn by Friendly and his men emphasising their opulent, crime-funded lifestyle and contrasting with the rough working clothes of the dockworkers, including Terry. \nA film as extensively written about and as frequently lauded as On the Waterfront can struggle to live up expectations. It's not the only Eliza Kazan film worth watching, and it isn't the only Marlon Brando vehicle worth watching; nevertheless, it is every bit the classic people say it is. Whilst cinema techniques have changed dramatically since 1954, it remains a masterful example of the film-makers art and \u2013 perhaps more importantly \u2013 it remains a gripping slice of melodrama.",

The movie takes place in a town on the waterfront on the east coast, (most likely New York) which was infested with Mob activity. The main characters are Terry and Edie, they are constantly fighting the mob and standing up for what is good and true. A new parishioner comes to town and helps the townspeople continue the fight against the Mob with the legal aspect of things. I felt like the acting was sub par, they all nailed the accents and different sounds but they did make me completely interested in the characters they played. I personally felt no connection when certain characters that died, which to me is a sign of bad acting. My favorite part of the movie was when Terry stood up to Johnny Friendly and Walked all the way to work and all the men followed him and not Johnny's orders to start work. This signified that the little man is no longer under the power of the oppressive boss and can finally not be required to live in fear.",

The other Best Picture winning film that Elia Kazan directed, Gentleman's Agreement (1947), was not very good so I had tempered my expectations for this film despite all of the hype behind it and I was pleasantly surprised by how great it was. This is not a film for people who cannot tolerate the overly dramatic storylines of this type of film or overwrought scores but for those who are willing to go in accepting that the film is significantly dated but still affecting it will be impactful.\n\nTerry Malloy, Marlon Brando, works for corrupt union boss Johnny Friendly, Lee J. Cobb, in exchange for payment that his fellow longshoremen don't receive. He helps Friendly and his men kill a dissenting dockworker, Joey Doyle, Ben Wagner, who would have testified to the Crime Commission about Friendly's dirty tactics. Malloy had not thought that Doyle would be murdered but he begins to question his actions when he falls in love with Doyle's educated sister Edie, Eva Marie Saint, and hears the words of priest Father Barry, Karl Malden, who urges him to do what is right for everybody. What really holds him back from betraying Friendly is that his brother Charlie, Rod Steiger, is a powerful mob boss and they have a strong bond despite Charlie destroying his life by ending his once promising boxing career.\n\nThe movie's storyline works because Malloy is believably innocent and dumb and those who support him see that but still expect him to try to be a good person. His relationship with his brother in particular makes Malloy sympathetic because we see two flawed young men who truly care about one another destroy their relationship due to the presence of an overbearing figure. Charlie's death is devastating to the audience but it's also convincing as motivation for Malloy to fully turn against the mob. The final moments of the film do feel victorious because we have followed this character along on his difficult journey and want to see him become reformed desperately.\n\nBrando's performance in this film is considered one of his best along with A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), The Godfather (1972), Last Tango in Paris (1972) and Apocalypse Now (1979). His performance has aged better than most performances from that time and I understand that his work significantly influenced a lot of modern acting. The performances that really surprised me however were those of Saint and Steiger who imbue their characters with such natural warmth that you can't help but feel for them. I wanted to reach out and comfort Saint as she tries her hardest to get Malloy on the right track and her luminous little face has a toughness to it that adds dimension to it. Steiger is vulnerable in a way that is reminiscent of his work in Marty (1953) and I believe that he should have won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nKazan also does a great job directing as he brings more perspective to this story than he does to Gentleman's Agreement due to his own past as an informant to HUAC. The film looks beautiful as most films Kazan directs do but here he broadens the canvas he works on and captures the lives of people living without hopes for tomorrow. Kazan completely earned his Best Director Academy Award, it was a cakewalk really, and the skill with which he made this film causes it to be even sadder that he made questionable decisions in life.\n\nThis was the Best Picture of 1954 and by far the best of the nominated films at the 1955 ceremony. I like The Country Girl (1954) and Three Coins in the Fountain (1954) but it is inarguable that On the Waterfront is the most influential of the bunch and it's continued relevance today proves that sometimes the Academy does make the right decision and are able to honor a film that has that something special about it that few films possess.",

The conversations between Brando and Marie Saint does spark romance.

One of the primary strength of the feature is its ferocious pace, leaping from one sequence to another, each moment is a pure delight.\n\nBlending it all in, the huge cast, high pitched dramatic sequences, complex relationship, morality conflicts and a vital message, all wrapped up in an envelope, this is as cinematic as the cinema can be.

Other than Brando.  We all know this is THE Brando movie.  So I went into Elia Kazan's Oscar-sweeping feature knowing just that one thing.\n\nAnd I enjoyed the movie, I did, but will be honest- I don't think I fully got it.  This is one of those movies that warrant a second viewing where you have more historical context.  Or you see it with a fan and they explain it you and then you are fully onboard with it.

A man (presumably a union worker and all-around nice guy based on how the folk described him in the flick) falls from a building and dies and it appears to be union or mob-related.  Marlon Brando's Terry Malloy is in the middle of this as he has allegiances to the mob union guys AND becomes romantically involved with the man who fell's sister (Eva Marie Saint- still alive 64 years later).  He falls for her but not off a building.  \n\nThat's a joke, I guess.\n\nThe performances, direction, and cinematography is all way ahead of its time- eschewing staginess for naturalism.

This is one film I will definitely be revisiting and hopefully, my review won't be so surface level.  In fact, I think this review could stand quite nicely\u00e2\u00a6on the waterfront.",

            "content": "One of the most thoughtful movies ever.\n\nElia Kazan's 1954 masterpiece is a lovely romance film that doubles as a crime drama. Kazan's direction is peerless as every shot is perfectly framed. You can picture every scene in your head with his unique framing, grounded storytelling, fast pace, realistic characterization, bloody violence, gritty aesthetic, and emotional realism. On the Waterfront is as real to life as movies get in all honesty.\n\nKazan has directed several great films in his career such as A Streetcar Named Desire, Viva Zapata!, On the Waterfront, and then East of Eden. His directorial prowess is self evident. Kazan earned every accolade he received for On the Waterfront including Best Director.\n\nI must mention Leonard Bernstein's iconic score for On the Waterfront. Bernstein's emotional and chaotic classical composition fits each scene perfectly. He matches the tone note for note with really clever music cues for the most dramatic turns. The hectic chases and fights are met with vigorous symphonic crashes, while the intimate moments of romance find the score swelling with a tender touch. This is top tier film composing at its finest. Bernstein only had to make this score alone to be legendary to me. \n\nNotably, Marlon Brando gives the most emotional performance of his life in On the Waterfront. Brando captures the tough guy machismo of a former boxer with the empathetic sincerity of a decent young man. His take on romance as simple honesty is inspired. Brando uses his voice so well as he emotes such hopelessness and frustration throughout On the Waterfront. You can see for yourself why this role changed acting forever after. Brando delivers what is perhaps his finest acting herein and it is quite moving.\n\nSimilarly, Eva Marie Saint absolutely nails it in her acting debut. She plays the innocent and naive girl trying to find justice for her brother. Her portrayal of a good girl and strong woman is really amazing. She stands up for herself and gives strength to Brando's character. Their chemistry is immediate and apparent. Saint is stunning to look at, but also a brilliant dramatic actress. She captures the will of a woman who will not take it anymore in a passionate performance like no other. I love Saint in On the Waterfront.\n\nOverall, On the Waterfront remains an all time classic of cinema. It is innovative and beautiful, while also influencing every director and actor after its release. I think it holds up wonderfully thanks to Elia Kazan's steadfast direction and the expressive acting from Marlon Brando and Eva Marie Saint. This is truly a must watch film.",

If anything I thought it was going to be overwrought Oscar-bait melodrama. I was pleased to find that it\u0092s actually a gripping tale of one guy and his struggles living under the arm of an unjust, mob-controlled union. Marlon Brando is amazing as Terry Malloy, because he blends toughness and naivete, so I instantly sympathized with him. Lee J. Cobb is an excellent counterpoint as the boss of the union. I just love watching that guy scream and shout. The heart of the movie is delivered by Karl Malden (playing the familiar role of the preacher in town) and Eva Marie Saint (the unlikely love interest.) It\u0092s nice because the great cast provides a figurative angel and devil on Terry\u0092s shoulders as he tries to figure out the right thing to do.\n\nThere\u0092s a lot of drama throughout On the Waterfront. I was on the edge of my seat through most of it, because I never knew whether people would be safe or if they\u0092d be met with an \u0093accident.\u0094 There are several extremely poignant scenes, and there\u0092s a reason that one line is so well known in pop culture because that scene almost brought me to tears. Almost everything in this movie worked for me on multiple levels. I was totally enthralled and when it was done I just wanted to see more. It took me through a whole range of emotions and left me feeling a buzz of excitement at the end. If I were to complain about anything it might be the shifting response of people in the crowds near the end of the movie. There were some times I didn\u0092t see why they were behaving in certain ways, but I have a basic understanding of mob mentality, and it kind of makes sense. So even my one complaint isn\u0092t really a complaint at all. I loved On the Waterfront and can\u0092t wait to watch it again.",

            "content": "'On the Waterfront' is a tour de force that really has it all - a great script, outstanding acting, and great direction.   It tells the story of a group of longshoremen who are being coerced into silence by their corrupt and mob-connected union bosses.   These are tough guys who work backbreaking jobs and have a code of not ratting out others.  It's this ethic combined with the threat of being denied work or killed that keeps them all in line.  We're sucked in immediately when in the opening minutes of the film there is a brutal murder to silence one of them, in which Marlon Brando finds himself unwittingly an accomplice.\n\nBrando is absolutely brilliant in this movie, and it boggles my mind that he considered his performance to be subpar after he saw it.   He is a genius in the big moments and in the small ones he creates.  Karl Malden is also outstanding as the priest who tries to rally the workers to stand up for themselves, and Lee J. Cobb and Rod Steiger turn in strong performances as the mob boss and one of his lieutenants (and Brando's brother), respectively.    It's a shame that these three were all nominated for best supporting actor but split the vote so that none of them would win, though the film won 8 others, including Best Picture.\n\nThe scene in the taxicab with the brothers, where Steiger implores and even threatens Brando to remain silent, is one of the best in movie history - not just because of the fantastic script, but also because of Brando's acting.    He recalls having to take a dive in a fight for a mob, and when his brother blames his manager for trying to bring him along too fast as a young boxer, running his career, he responds:\n\n\"It wasn't him Charlie, it was you.  Remember that night in the Garden, you came down into my dressing room and said, 'kid, this ain't your night.  We're going for the price on Wilson.'   You remember that?  This ain't your night!   My night ... I could have taken Wilson apart.  So what happens, he gets the title shot outdoors in a ballpark and what do I get, a one-way ticket to palookaville.  You was my brother, Charlie, you shoulda looked out for me a little bit.  You shoulda taken care of me, just a little bit, so I wouldn't have to take them dives for the short-end money.\"\n\nCharlie: \"I had some bets down for you, you saw some money.\"\n\n\"You don't understand!  I coulda had class, I coulda been a contender!  I coulda been somebody!  Instead of a bum, which is what I am, let's face it.  It was you, Charlie.\"  \n\nThat scene of being let down by a loved one is so poignant that on its own it makes the movie worth watching, but it's rock solid throughout, even if a little on the dramatic side at the ending.  Kazan provided great direction with scenery that looked realistic because it was, having been shot in Hoboken with many of the extras real longshoremen, and on rooftops with aerials and dovecotes.    I absolutely HATE the idea that Kazan made the film in part to justify his own testimony to congress during the McCarthy years, but it's a sad fact about the backstory of the film.  \n\nWith that said, I have to put that aside and give it credit for being a great, great film.  Aside from the taxicab scene, there are a couple of others that give me goosebumps every time I see them, one of which is Malden calling out the bosses in a speech despite being threatened and having garbage thrown at him (\"Every time the mob puts pressure on a good man and stops him from doing his duty as a citizen - it's a crucifixion!\").    This is a tough, gritty movie, about the little man overcoming intimidation to stand up for himself against evil.    The theme is timeless, and the movie creates timeless, immortal moments.",

Constantly forgetting that it's supposed to be about brutal mob bosses and cowardly Longshoremen, it's too often distracted by the repetitive interactions between its leads. It's very unfocused and melodramatic, the editing is clumsy in places, and the music is incredibly irritating. At certain points there a surge in the soundtrack when there's absolutely no call for it, and the characters appear to stand around awkwardly as if waiting for it to die down, and the dramatic score hammers away at the dramatic moments, making them unduly schmaltzy. There's also some very poor fight choreography, including 1 or 2 punches executed so badly I found myself laughing at them.\nOverall I didn't hate the film, I just thought it was too cluttered to be enjoyable and too dull to be rewatchable. It may be a classic in many people eyes, and certainly impressed the Academy in it's time, but for me it's an over-long snoozer I won't be rushing to see again any time soon.",

Yes this film brings with it a whole plethora of\nemotion and action which culminates in a euphoric feeling of movie\ngoodness. I felt the film to be a solidly sublime movie and here below\nis exactly why so.\n\nThe story is a good mix of thrills but also romance and a little good\nold fashioned straight line drama. The story is not the fastest but not\nmany of the time were and although the running time is not too long,\nthe plot seems to incorporate everything you feel you need to know. It\nreally steps up a gear toward the end and not to spoil anything for a\npossible pre watching reader but the end is pumped full of tense scenes\nand you really feel what is going in the characters mind.\n\nThe acting is some of the best I have ever seen, Marlon Brando is\nflawless and finding a better performance is hard to come by or think\nof. I found Karl Malden as the calm but very stern Father Barry almost\nas good and he really connects with Brando to create some great scenes\ntogether. I found Eve Marie Saint to be maybe not as good but powerful\nas Edie and she works well with both the actors above to make the cast\none of the best assembled.\n\nElia Kazan directs very well indeed and his vision is brought out with\nsuch ferocity that a seemingly slow moving drama becomes full of life\nand passion. Budd Schulberg co creates a script which breathes\noriginality and he pursues the right way to script perfectly. I felt\nthat if the movie were made now in none black and white and with a\nmodern twist, it would still work and that is why it feels so relevant\nto me.\n\nIt's hard to think of too much wrong with the thing but at a try the\nmore slower scenes and over dramatic acting by some of the extras comes\nout. The acting I speak of is mostly confined to when large groups mass\nand they are poorly chosen, I will say though that the cast such as\nBrando can literally turn a scene into gold by just being there.\n\nI think if you like a good old film that really shows the true spirit\nof the main character then this is for you, you go along with Terry\nMalloy and feel how he feels at every turn. You may not like it so much\nif you dislike all the sets and of course black and white, it is a near\nmasterpiece but I do see why some would not like it as much as others\ndo.\n\nOverall I gave it a high 9/10 and a solid one of that, not quite reaching an\nA+ but ever so close indeed. This is one movie where you feel it is\nhard to give a grade, the story gets it a certain point but then the\nacting and direction come in and give it so many more marks than it\nalready has. Give it a try and you may just really enjoy it, not to\nmention go around telling people this is the best movie you have ever\nseen.",

Sometimes you got to make a stand for yourself even if it's risky. That being said sometimes I don't know if it was just me but at times I had trouble hearing/understanding some of the actors-I think Brando mumbles sometimes. I also didn't care much for the female character while I can empathize with her she was always coming into scenes kind of screeching and being overly dramatic. Also some parts were a little slow.

Just the mention of Ella Kazan's magnum opus brings to mind black and white images of grizzled longshoremen, run down tenements, and a young, handsome Brando telling us he \"coulda been a contender.\" It won eight academy awards, was selected for preservation by the Library of Congress, and has appeared on practically every critic's short list of the greatest movies ever made. And you'd better believe it belongs there. Gripping and tense, with incredible acting and a powerful message, it was and is a watershed work of cinema whose impact hasn't lessened a bit in the sixty years since it was released.\n\nMuch of the film's greatness owes to its leading man. Brando is beyond magnificent. His acting has more facets to it than a diamond. Like an onion, you keep finding new layers as you go along. His gestures, his facial expressions, the way he says his lines in his heavy Brooklyn accent combine in an acting style that's exaggerated yet believable, lending him an incredible and unforgettable presence.\n \nAs prizefighter turned harbor bum Terry Malloy he's charismatic, romantic, jaded, cynical, vulnerable, pitiful, sympathetic, and deeply convicted all at once. He's a nobody who knows that he could have been a somebody, a lay about who coasts his way through life on connections and doing the occasional favor for the union bosses. He's a man who claims to believe in nothing but looking out for himself, but whose conscience just won't let him rest until he does the right thing, even if it makes him an outcast- or worse. \n\t\nHis internal struggle between doing the right thing and the easy, safe thing shapes the film every bit as much as the external struggle between him and Johnny Friendly's goons. Both conflicts present a stark contrast between the noble and the base. Just as the dichotomy between the longshoreman and the local bosses is one of hard work and brotherhood against greed, corruption, and oppression, so his choice is between courage and altruism, or giving in to temptation and fear. Yet there's another element to his dilemma that's not so black and white.\n\t\nIf he testifies, he'll be breaking the code of silence that rules the waterfront. The very people he's helping will look down on him as a snitch, a \"cheese eater\" in waterfront vernacular. What's more, he'll be turning on his own brother, who sits at Johnny Friendly's at right hand and gave Terry every break he ever had. Even when his brother is halfhearted trying to threaten him into staying mum, you can see the love they have for each other and their anguish that they could be on opposite sides of this unfortunate business.\n\t\nTerry isn't going to take the big step on his own, but he's got two people to give him the push he needs: local priest Father Barry, and Edie Doyle, sister of the man Terry saw murdered. Barry, played by Karl Malden, is the one man who's not afraid of the mobsters running the waterfront; he's angry. Angry that they can continue to prey on and profit from the common folk, that they can get away with murder, that everyone else is scared enough to let them get away with murder. His speech over the body of a worker killed in an \"accident\" is a profound spectacle of righteous indignation. Only in the same film as Brando does his performance come off as second best.\n\t\nFor her part, Edie, played by Eva Marie Saint, makes the perfect romantic interest for Brando's Terry. Though innocent and somewhat shy, her determination to find out who killed her brother makes relentless and feisty, unafraid to call out those who know more than they're saying. Alone among the waterfront's residents she sees the inherent goodness behind Terry's tough fa\u00e7ade, and believes that he can do what's right, and will- whether he wants to or not. And as mismatched as they seem to be, there's an undeniable attraction between them. Together they remind me more than a little of Rocky and Adrian. \n\t\nTerry's ultimate decision to testify against the bosses is of course a stand in for Kazan's decision to testify before the house, for which he was reviled by many in Hollywood. Whether Kazan made the right decision is beside the point in judging the merits of this film. What matters is that Terry's story is Kazan's retelling of his own story, and that, as much as Brando's acting, is what gives it its impact. Kazan absolutely threw himself into making this movie. As a way of justifying himself, getting back at his critics, and proving that he was one of if not the best damned director in Hollywood, he poured everything he had into the project; and the results are spectacular.\n\t\nIn every scene Kazan ratchets up the tension and suspense, making Terry's dilemma more pressing and bringing the specter of violence closer. The stark black and white cinematography lend the film even more atmosphere, the shadows and unlit nighttime streets heightening the sense of danger as the bleak rooftop vistas bring out the poverty and lack of prospects facing the waterfront dwellers. The tight pacing alternates between scenes of Terry's inner struggle and the more physical battle being waged throughout the neighborhood, never rushing nor letting the movie drag. And when the tension boils over and things come to a head, Kazan makes sure his message is delivered with all the power he can muster.\n\t\nThe moral of this movie is not, as some have interpreted it, that unions are corrupt and predatory or that snitching on your friends makes you a hero. It's that when you see corruption all around you, when people are being hurt or taken advantage of and that's just the way it is, it doesn't matter if there's a code of silence. It's not talking that's a betrayal; of yourself and those around you. There's no honor in protecting men who have no honor themselves. Friends who are willing to see you dead aren't really your friends.\n\nTerry's decision is made more noble because he didn't just anonymously leave a tip or make a statement in the safety of a police station. He stood up on the witness stand in front of bosses and told the whole truth for all the world to hear. And then against all good judgment, he went right down to the docks and told Johnny Friendly right to his face what a loser he was. His decision to let Johnny goad him into a fistfight probably owed more to hot headedness than courage, and even an ex-heavyweight can't take on a whole gang with bare knuckles. But even if he couldn't win a fight against Johnny's gang, he still won the battle. Because what he couldn't do with his fists he did by inspiring others with word and courageous example.\n\n\tIn real life things wouldn't work out so easily, and they didn't. In the true story that On the Waterfront was based on, one dockworker's defiance was not enough to bring down the mob and clean up the docks. But watching Brando take those slow, faltering steps to the loading dock, blood on his face and eyes half closed as every man silently watches, you can absolutely believe that the little guy can triumph and honest men can overcome the most deeply entrenched corruption.",

It's a powerful drama with a brilliant cast on top form. Set in Hoboken, New Jersey. Union boss Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb) rules the local waterfront with an iron fist, and it's no secret that he has mob connections. When dockworker Joey Doyle (Ben Wagner) threatens to testify against Friendly, he ends up dead. Joey's co-worker and former boxer Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) is urged to testify against Friendly by waterfront priest Father Barry (Karl Malden), but Terry refuses to. Plus, he's become romantically close to Joey's sister Edie (Eva Marie Saint). However, when Terry's conscience gets the better of him, his brother Charley (Rod Steiger), who works for Friendly, is put in an awkward position. It's still a powerful and grim look at what happens when organised crime and unions meet, Brando is tough but has heart, and he's backed with a brilliant cast. It's the closest you'll get to an American equivalent of our Kitchen Sink Dramas, but this had it's fingers on the pulse of the mood of America at the time.",

The close-up, magnetic cinematography was not completely innovative, but Marlon Brando took advantage of this and toned down theatrical tendencies in favour of subtle, more human transformations. I can admire actors who commit fully to extreme actions under extreme circumstances, and it looks great on stage. However, we do not always see the world as a stage. Humans are not usually prone to acting theatrically, even under extreme circumstances. Brando's performance is a shining example of using film to express actions carefully, yet still specifically. I love the pounding jazz rhythms of Leonard Bernstein's score, the suspiciously misleading symbolism of a jacket, and the cold, distant attention to those who are seen as insignificant. Truly, I loved to watch this movie.\n\nAnd yet, when I think about the story, I am not quite close enough to giving a full five stars. Summary: Crime rules an east coast town on the waterfront, where a mob handles dock shipments for, y'know, shady gangster deals. The details of what the mob does aren't of much focus. What matters more is how their actions affect everyone else. A young, washed-up ex-boxer named Terry (Brando) works for his uncle Johnny Friendly (Lee Cobb), leader of the mob, as he sees himself as a bum and incapable of reaching for what he truly wants in life. When working with the religiously conflicted Edie Doyle (Eva Marie Saint), whose brother is thrown off a balcony at the beginning of the movie, and Father Barry (Karl Malden), a priest who encourages those who work at the docks to stand up and fight for fair rights. The desperation of our three heroes in rallying a town full of hopeless victims is such an engaging experience. I am only disappointed by the turnout of these circumstances. That is all I will choose to say. Otherwise, I highly commend director Elia Kazan's On the Waterfront on all levels.",

The prestige of this monochromic magnum opus is merely indisputable so as to my sheer expectation could not be more intrigued.\n\nIt is a forthright story, a bum longshoreman's awakening to his conscience and takes on a venal union boss and his heavy minions. There are several incentives for his self-morphing into a better person, his love to a girl who in turn elicits his true grit, the demise of his brother (a pretty slow-witted move to put the final nail in the coffin to urge a man at his wits' end to go to the opposite of the line), and a religious influence from a virtuous priest, whose righteous homily is spirit-lifting but cannot deliver the huddled mass from numb apathy. Against the grain, it is also an indictment of the repressed workers who is suffer from crowd conformity psychology and cowardice, the most abhorrent thing is one of the sidekick child massacres all the pigeons just to demonstrate an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth when Brando finally musters his courage to be a key witness in a murder case against the boss, it feels blatantly inexplicable and rather far-fetched. The same can be referred to the ending, a battered-up Brando (with horrible bloodstain make-up) struggles to stand up and walk towards the gate so rest of the longshoremen can be convinced that they should follow suit and disregard whatever reasons hold them back. It is a too-well calculated victory.\n\nBad-mouthing about some uneasiness while watching this picture aside, Brando emanates a tremendous air of competence as the young loafer stranded in the underbelly of the dock, his two-hander with Eva Marie Saint comes well-handled, alternately romantic and endangered, and Saint's film debut is also a fortuitous triumph for her, a borderline leading part nabbed BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS trophy. Wondrously, the film also holds the record of securing three slots as BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR nominees (but no win), Kazan's longtime workmate Malden emotes a paragon crime-defender as the priest, J. Cobb is the pure evil as the ringleader while his henchmen are completely imbecile and a young Steiger is the in-between as the ill-fated brother, an ambiguous image betrays great empathy in the illustrious conversing scenes inside the taxi with Brando.  \n\nON THE WATERFRONT also manifests Kazan's top-notch deployment of the camera, with DP Boris Kaufman, the close-ups and fixated angle shots run fluently without tampering the rhythm of its grim reality. Leonard Bernstein's accompanying score adheres firmly to the vascular impulse of the predictable diegesis. Thus, it is a fine piece of filmmaking and reminisces of the Golden Age with a touch of working-class bashing which may leave a small number of its modern audience nonplussed.",

            "content": "\"You don't understand. I coulda had class. I coulda been a contender. I coulda been somebody, instead of a bum, which is what I am, let's face it. It was you, Charley.\"\n\nAfter three Oscar nominations (for A Streetcar Named Desire, Viva Zapata, and Julius Caesar), Marlon Brando finally won an Oscar for his role as ex-boxer Terry Malloy in Elia Kazan's Best Picture winner, On the Waterfront. Brando's performance was a revolutionary change in the acting world forever. Today, his performance still carries out, making On the Waterfront an extraordinary film.\n\nEx-fighter Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) has working for mobster Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb), who disguises his terror as a labor union. Johnny has been responsible for many murders in the waterfront area, with the most recent being a man named Johnny. His sister, Edie (Eva Marie Saint, in her film debut) wants to know who killed her brother, and with the help of priest Father Barry (Karl Malden), they start questioning \"union\" workers. Malloy, realizing that he was partly responsible for Johnny's death, starts to develop a close bond with Edie, and Malloy finally realizes that he can change the union for good.\n\nThe film also features Rod Steiger as Charlie, Terry Malloy's crooked mobster brother.  \n\nDirector Elia Kazan has got a bad rep over the years for the true reason why he made this film. In the 50's, during the time of the Cold War and fears that Hollywood actors and directors are communist, Kazan testified in court revealing names of his friends that were communist. Because of this, he made On the Waterfront to express his emotions. Some directors refused to trust Kazan again, and to this day, Kazan still has a poor reputation. Well, if Kazan was fighting against communism, he did a powerful job. On the Waterfront, on the other hand, while it doesn't address the problems of communism, it addresses corrupt labor unions, and either way, the film is a powerful experience.\n\nKazan, who also directed Brando in the even-more powerful Streetcar Named Desire, directed this movie with a strong intention. The way he directed Waterfront is a unique approach to cinema. The locations of the waterfront show the dark, eerie, approach to a dark and sometimes disturbing area. The cinematography really delivers here, and it's probably why it won an Oscar as well. The score, by Leonard Bernstein (in his only film that was not a musical), is impressive. I love the jazzy sounds that remind me of Bernstein's later work (West Side Story), and that French horn solo in the beginning is stellar.\n\nBut the best part about On the Waterfront is the acting. Marlon Brando, who changed the term acting forever, is completely stunning in the role of Terry Malloy. His raw emotions, pure drama, and his domination of the screen makes a performance that was completely deserving of the Academy Award. Lee J. Cobb was brilliant as the corrupt mobster Johnny Friendly. From his tough attitude, Cobb's presence makes you feel how intimidating his character really is. Rod Steiger is also well-cast as Malloy's brother. The scene where he and Brando are talking in the car (which is where Brando delivers his famous \"I coulda had class\" speech) is one of my favorite moments in the film (besides the climax). Karl Malden also delivers as the priest. I got goosebumps when he gave his speech about crucifixions. And what about Eva Marie Saint? Well, for me, she was just OK. For a film debut, Saint had beautiful screen presence and her acting was fine (which was why she won the Oscar as well), but during the romantic scenes with her and Brando, that's when things begin to fall apart. The chemistry in these scenes lacked passion and served as boring rather than exciting. Compared to Brando's romantic chemistry with Kim Hunter in Streetcar, this romance is a little dull.\n\nWhile the romance between Brando and Eva Marie Saint bored me a bit, On the Waterfront is an exciting and powerful film, with powerful acting all around, a legendary performance from Brando, wonderful direction and cinematography, a story that inspires, and a legendary Leonard Bernstein score that knocks your socks off. A Streetcar Named Desire might have been the better film for me, but that doesn't mean that I didn't like this one. I say watch On the Waterfront and be wowed by a wonderful, inspiring, experience.\n\n\"You want to know what's wrong with our waterfront? It's the love of a lousy buck. It's making love of a buck - -the cushy job - -more important than the love of man! \"",

And Scorsese, in turn, was clearly inspired by the moral leanings of the films (and real life) of Elia Kazan. \"On the Waterfront\" isn't an epic, but it's a touching blend of brains, brawn, family and consequences, indebted to its small-time criminals in a big-time and honest way. Try not to fall for Leonard Bernstein's tragically beautiful score. It's so good, in fact, it would have been easy for Kazan to use it as a crutch. He doesn't.

Unfortunately, I ended being part of the group that it did not really appeal to. As ground-breaking and artful as this movie may have been, to me, most of the elements were too commonplace by today's standards to be enjoyable.\n\nThe movie is about a dockworker (Brando) who witnesses a murder of a fellow worker who was going to testify against the mob. The mob, as it turns out, runs the docking business on the waterfront. Brando's character was comfortable playing \"deaf and dumb\" to the murder until he meets and falls for the murdered man's sister. Add in a priest that weighs heavily on his conscience, and you can see where the movie is headed.\n\nThe ideas involving whistle-blowing, inner moral conflict and even corrupt bosses vs. innocent laborers have been pretty well played out do date ... so as powerful as they once may have been, they are not quite as effective to a modern viewer.\n\nBrando's performance was clearly good and will forever stand the test of time. The way he moves, speaks and even communicates through his body-language is impressive. We can perceive his conflict and struggle through his mannerisms and the delivery of his words. Good as his performance was, it was not quite enough to make up for the familiarity of the plot.\n\nBecause this movie is so well respected and celebrated, the prudent thing to say is to check the movie and see what you think. My rating only reflects the fact that it's not an automatic win in everyone's book; my guess is that you'll know in the first 15 minutes if this movie is going to appeal to you.",

Actually, maybe that's not the best testament to the weight of this film's subject matter, because I doubt that anyone who was working on this film was all that angry, seeing as how the only 12 things that fell upon this film were Oscar nominations. I know that Elia Kazan must have been mighty happy, because around this time, he was in some serious trouble with people in the film industry, just because he did some little thing like, well, falsely sell out many of his friends and colleagues as communists during the Red Scare. Hey, Kazan may have been a total jerk, but he sure knew how to make some good film, and I reckon that means that he must have been getting about as many directorial tips from Marlon Brando as Brando was getting directorial tips from him, because Brando was so far along the edge that I think that I probably should count again after stating that there are only two of the \"12 Angry Men\" in this film. That film does seem like the kind that Brando would be in, and if he was there the final product would have been much tighter, because all you need to do to settle a jury debate is have Brando toss down his opinion, then everyone would agree, for you do not say no to Brando, partially because he might end up collecting twice his salary and leaving the project on the spot. Like I said, he wasn't exactly the nicest dude to work with, but he sure could carry a good film, like this one, though not so much so that you could completely look through issues, of which, there is a quite a bit in this effort.\n\nThere's plenty of meat to this drama, especially for 1954, being just fleshed out enough for you to gain a fairly firm grip on the depths of this story and its characters, and yet, with that said, I can't help but feel as though this film should have spent a bit more time cooking things up, at least enough for your investment to go reinforced to the point of obscuring the near-glaring conventionalism that taints more than a few spots within this generally refreshing film. At the very least, more time spent meditating upon the depths of storytelling would have helped in softening the quantity of hurried spots in this plot's structure, because at just under 110 minutes, this conceptually quite layered drama is very rarely a bit too swift in its flow, and never too hurried when it does, in fact, get carried away with conciseness in development, sometimes to an offputting point that momentarily disengages, though not quite as much as the moments that hardly feel frantic. Like the hurried spots, this film's slow spots never go so far as to be all-out dull, but when momentum slows down and atmosphere dries up, quite a bit of blandness enues, choking up kick within resonance, and leaving you vulnerable to slipping out of the final product, at least for a few moments. The pacing issues within this film, by their own individual rights, stand to be more problematic, but stand they do, and just firmly enough to spark a kind of inconsistency in pacing that leaves storytelling to get a bit repetitious after a while, and lose a bit of its kick, of which there is only so much even when you don't take pacing issues into considering, seeing as how, during this film's era, you could only go so long with effective genuineness before losing a bit of grit. The film was a bit ahead of its time, and boasts plenty of aspects that remain compelling to this day, yet there are still some issues with resonance, whether they be seen through the occasional subtlety lapse, or through a consistent degree of superficiality that was distinctly 1950s. There's most certainly not enough of this superficiality for the final product to fall flat as barely compelling, and decidedly underwhelming, but there are indeed subtlety issues to go with pacing issues and, to a certain degree, exposition issues, thus making a film that may be well-executed enough to reward, but hands on the hinges of underwhelmingness. Of course, slips through these hinges and underwhelming don't come into play enough to make the final product underwhelming on the whole, for although this films has quite a few flaws, - however limited in quantity they may be - it has enough going for its impress dramatically, or at least visually.\n\nSpeaking of 1950s limitations, we're talking about a film that's too black-and-white, and too backed by improvable photographic technology, for its own good, so it's not like we're looking at a visually stunning film, or even something along the lines of \"Citizen Kane\", but through all of their shortcomings, the tastes of cinematographer Boris Kaufman (Jeez, the guys who made \"12 Angry Men\" must have been big fans of this film), whose lushly clever plays with lighting absorb about as much crisp detail as you can gather from a film this under-colored, especially when the black-and-white limitations of this film's visual style are actually put to get use to compliment grit, often in something of a noirish fashion. Kaufman's efforts catch your eyes time and again, as surely as Leonard Bernstein's efforts catch your ears time and again, for although what follows an upstanding opening track is a collection of mostly rather conventional musical pieces that don't quite live up to the sweep that starts this show out with a bang, Bernstein's score is consistently commendable, if not rather beautiful, boasting enough subtle, but graceful spirit to color up entertainment value, if not compliment the soul of this film's substance value. Artistic touches like Kaufman's cinematography and Bernstein's score are, at this point, not too much better than not really all that worth writing home about, but the reasonably distinsuished visual and musical stylistic choices that help in defining this film color up the final product's atmosphere in a fashion that helps you in further gaining a grip on the vaue within this film's subject matter. In execution, this film's story concepts don't entirely recieve the meaty justice that they deserve, even though they're actually not all that terribly weighty on paper, but the subject matter behind this drama is undeniably worthwhile, especially when it is, in fact, brought quite well to life by quite a few offscreen talents, especially director Elia Kazan, whose direction isn't all that strong, but still sharp enough to grace this film with an audacity and gritty range that was seldom seen at this time. Sure, the film's dramatic aspects have their shortcomings, being faced with plenty of limitations, as well as plenty of more consequential issues, but when it's all said and done, the final product doesn't quite fall through to underwhelming, being padded as rewarding by inspired storytelling, as well as, of course, inspired acting. I won't go so far as to call the acting in this film absolutely upstanding on a general standard, but for this time, we were looking at some pretty influential performances, which still stand as commendable to this day, with Marlon Brando being particularly compelling, delivering on an assured and layered presence that defines the Terry Malloy as a flawed and mysterious, yet ultimately human force. As you watch Brando gradually evolve his role, you'd be hard pressed to not be engaged, perhaps even thoroughly, and while not everything about this drama is as compelling as Brando's performance, which, even then, feels a bit underwritten in certain places, natural and consequential shortcomings go battled back just enough for the film to stand as flawed, but crafted with enough compelling confidence to compel.\n\nOverall, thin spots in development leave you to meditate upon the conventional areas in this film's storytelling, while uneven pacing that is much too often bookended by spots that are either too hurried or too slow leaves repetition to set in and do damage to resonance, which is further tainted by subtlety issues that could barely be helped at the time, but still stand firmly enough to almost drive the final product into the underwhelmingness that just can't quite obscure what is done right in this ambition film, which boasts enough attractive sharpness in its photography and score, and inspiration in its direction and acting to color up worthy subject matter that makes \"On the Waterfront\" a once-refreshing and still-compelling dramatic thriller.\n\n3/5 - Good",

While the film has a more than an interesting concept it didn't embark on my emotions. I was wowed by the technique by director Kazan, but I never felt a feeling of sorrow or joy during the movie. Even the concluding scene, while this might sound sadistic, I believe should've had more cruelty to it. So while it's a good film, it didn't effect me so I can't call it a great film. Marlon Brando had a decent performance, but no fire works really bursted. Many believe it was his best though, so I might be talking out of my ass.",

            "content": "Marlon Brando revolutionizes acting right before our eyes in On The Waterfront! The challenge in watching classic cinema is that those films loose their power as the years pass & our culture, our sensibilities & our level of sophistication evolves as viewers & film makers. Film making evolves building upon what has past and as this evolution roles on  older films such as this loose their powerful impact. At least to some degree, it's inevitable.\r\n\r\nBut Brando...WOW! His quirky tough guy with a delicate sensibility is extraordinary. Still to this day Brando's 'power' remains fully evident in glorious scene after scene. Brando's acting style is so different than his peers he seems of another time. Ahead of his time! His acting style did revolutionize film acting and all of us film lovers owe him a debt of gratitude & deep respect for his contributions to his art. This is acting at it's rarified finest.\r\n\r\nThe film still remains a classic. The film was based on a true story of a longshoreman who tried to overthrow a corrupt union. In real life he did not succeed. The story on screen was also heavily influenced at the time of it's making by its director, Elia Kazan who earlier testified before the house of Un-American Activities Commitee. He named former associates who he said were involved in the Communist Party. This experience was a major influence in his personal life & he brought his ideas & passions about a whistle blower to this film.\r\n\r\nOn The Waterfront clearly remains one of the great classics & is a film that all film lovers should see. Brando is remarkable & his performance remains one of the great performances by a male actor in a lead in film history.",

            "content": "In his first great crime film Marlon Brando teamed with Elia Kazan and played a very different sort of character. It tells a moving story of a man who chooses to change in very difficult circumstances and to do what is ultimately right. This film has great characters and memorable dialogue that show the complexity of the human race. It proved that Brando could play a true hero and not only a villain. In this film starring a wonderful cast including Brando, Rod Steiger, Karl Malden, Lee J. Cobb, and Eva Marie Sainte, a washed up prizefighter redeems himself. The waterfront is a tough area controlled by a gang led by Cobb. Brando's Terry Malloy gives them information about a young man, because his brother (Steiger) is second in command. Only afterwards does he find out they knocked the man off and now Malloy must deal with his conscience. He slowly falls for the dead boy's sister and must tell her the truth. With the help of Sainte and a Father played by Malden, Malloy testifies to put away Cobb for good. However his brother Steiger pays the ultimate price after one of the most poignant scenes in movie history. Kazan behind the camera does a good job at allowing his actors to flourish. This film is definitely a great one telling a classic story of redemption.",
