Other than that, it is interesting for what it is. Gibson's motive for waging war against England does not make quite sense to me. At first it is because his lover had been executed but then it turns into a fight for freedom. That transition did not seem very connected. But after that, it is an entertaining movie. I do warn you though, it gets worse on re-watch. Character motives is so important and it just does not seem very fluent throughout.",

It's more action-based than anything, but there is a love plot and a friendship plot and everything. All in all, it's a very deep and touching movie with large amounts of killing.\n\nIf you like action movies or just great movies in general, then definitely check this out. It shouldn't disappoint.",

Randall Wallace did enough research to be aware of what the real story was and how Wallace was the son of a noblemen and not the peasant he is made out to be. Another problem (if you consider this a problem) is the power it gave to the Scottish nationalists. It's inaccurate, dull and filled with cliches. But it does have some decent battle scenes (even if they are totally inaccurate) for example, the battle of Stirling Bridge. But my issue with that scene is how the scots, inspired by their great leader after wanting to retreat, come out victorious despite having no armor or no proper plans. Overall this film is decent but still an inaccurate mess. Such a shame when it had so much potential.",

It was like a three-hour long gratuitously violent battle scene interspersed with some sex. I wished that they had made an effort to portray the backgrounds of the various clans/nobles, of Robert the Bruce, etc. And Mel Gibson's \"acting\" certainly doesn't help; perhaps he should have stuck to production of this epic, of which he did a commendable job. I probably got about 30 minutes of value from this film, which included I finding out who Sophie Marceau was and why she was (justifiably) famous for her beauty. But then, it was on a day when I didn't have anything particularly useful to do for the other 150 minutes, and so I don't quite regret watching it. Got this monkey off my back.",

So moving in every way, and you will cry at least fifteen times while watching it. This movie isn't for the faint of heart, however, as it's very gory, displays scenes where characters are torn apart on screen, and constant blood. But then again; it's a movie about war. You have to know that when coming into it. It's an incredible display of yet another great Mel Gibson performance, as he plays the perfect William Wallace. This film does everything well: scenery, accents, costumes, plot, you name it. It's utterly perfect, in my opinion, and I think if you haven't seen this movie at least once, you haven't really lived.",

The story is also intriguing, keeping you interested throughout. The problem I have with this film is the dialogue, which is a mess, and the acting from everyone outside of Gibson and a few others. The plot can also feel very cheesy at parts, and there are also a number of goofy things that occur throughout.

With his second feature, director Mel Gibson crafted an old-fashioned war epic that holds up today as an impressive achievement in Cinema. Using captivating cinematography, Gibson draws viewers into the world of a rebellious Scottish warrior that seeks justice for his wife's murder. From intimate close-ups to awe-inspiring establishing shots, the cinematography keeps viewers immersed in the film's period setting. Gibson excels at staging the battle sequences for his film using dazzling production design, costumes and musical cues. In terms of acting, the entire ensemble is at the top of its game. Mel Gibson delivers one of the best performances of his career as William Wallace. With mesmerizing expressions, he conveys the courage, heartache and self-sacrifice of the Scottish warrior that is determined to save his country. The supporting cast, which includes the brilliant Brendan Gleeson, is also excellent and worthy of recognition. Although \"Braveheart\" is undeniably an unforgettable historical epic, ultimately it is not a flawless film. At nearly three hours, it suffers from a lengthy running-time that tests the viewer's patience. Moreover, it builds to a melodramatic conclusion that lacks a sense of subtlety. Nevertheless, fans of historical war epics will definitely enjoy \"Braveheart\" and so will movie-goers seeking rousing entertainment. At a time when Mel Gibson remains a controversial figure in Hollywood, it's a rousing reminder that an artists' work is worth separating from his public persona.",

Convincing and absolutely realistically brutal, those bloody and barbaric fight scenes define this flick. The Scottish medieval setting is well done and Mel Gibson gives a memorable lead performance. It's interesting how Braveheart tackles themes of revenge, tyranny, bravoury and honor. But the pic is almost three hours long, and the script is sometimes a little lacking.

A few small scenes of his acting are excellent for me the won who comes to mind for me is when in the middle of a battle and he sees is horseback part of his army to come only to see they were bought off the look of desperation and disappointment were gut wrenching. \n         Two other notable performances for me are Sophie Marceau as Princess Isabella of Wales as she gave a lovely performance to show she cared for Wallace. Brendon Gleeson also gave a great performance as Hamish a close friend of Wallace.\n         I only have a few gripes with the film one I have mentioned is the historical inaccuracies but if I am honest having William Wallace interacting with Robert De Bruce so I can forget that. My main dislike of the film is Wallace's relationship with his first wife before she was murdered by the English, it feels like we did not get to see their relationship bloom to marriage and I feel they never touch that he would be angry that she may have been carrying his child(ren).\n        In conclusion I think this is a must see even though I had gripes with this film and I did debate giving it four and a half starts by the more I think the more I believe this is a must see which means it is not perfect the it is a must see for all. Some say the 3 hour run time is too long but I disagree it had to fit so much story and characters in I am surprised it is not longer, anyway I love this film that all must see at leat once.",

As the soldiers invade Scotland, Wallace forms an army and vows for freedom from England's iron-clad hands. This war epic has been a subject of debate, particularly with its overabundance of historical inaccuracies. Speaking as a person who is partly from Scottish origin, I felt multiple itches in the historical department as well, but I do defend the movie's artistic licensing even with its formulaic Hollywood storyline. The main reason for these changes, I believe, is that Gibson wanted to capture the mythological effect of Wallace rather than make a biography of the man. Let's face it, even screenwriter Randall Wallace, who's other cliched historically inaccurate film Pearl Harbor I really hated, used that logic when asked about the film. He even shot daggers at historians in the beginning of the film, claiming them as usurpers and slayers of heroes. Speaking of, the inaccuracies are as follows: Alexander II died in 1286 and not 1280, Princess Isabella (Sophie Marceau) never met William Wallace and would have been a toddler when her father-in-law requested prima nocta in the movie, prima nocta was never a thing at the time, plaid kilts were not a thing until four centuries later, and neither William Wallace nor his soldiers painted their faces with blue woab during battle. I could go on and on with the list of information I gathered, mostly from HistoryBuffs, but I want to wrap up with this statement. Even if the film's history is on par with Disney's Pocahontas or 10,000 BC, the movie itself is very hit-and-miss even as a piece of historical fiction. \n\n(3 Mooning Scotsmen out of 5)",

            "content": "In this day of ever increasing social awareness, it is often difficult to separate artistic endeavors from the harsh realities of their creators. Do you still listen to Michael Jackson songs? Do you still watch Woody Allen movies? Do you still watch Bill Cosby shows? It is in this same vein I had great discontent with my need to watch a Mel Gibson film in order to complete my goal of seeing all Oscar Winning Best Pictures.  Mel Gibson is a racist, anti-Semitic, misogynist, homophobic cur.  But he did direct and star in the film that would be handed the Oscar statue for Best Picture in 1996. That film is Braveheart.\n\nSince Mel likes to see things superficially I'm going to start my critique in the same. The hair.  Need I say more?  His ridiculous hair alone knocks this movie from a possible A to a B.  Full stop.  It is beyond absurd that a movie that strives so hard to realistically show the messiness and sludge of the natural landscapes of the film's era (the 1200's) would allow for this big 90's windswept Fabio doo.  It's a nearly 40 year old Mel Gibson trying to play a 20-something character by attempting to rock out the hair of Nick on Family Ties.  The hair was atrocious.  My feeling is that it was supposed to represent William Wallace's (Gibson's character in the film) virility, a characteristic the movie strives to continually reinforce.  If this is the case, the hair is an epic fail.\n\nA friend pointed out the realistic nature of the fight scenes, and how every single character (of hundreds) in these ambitious battles seems to be fully choreographed.  I would agree.  These scenes are cinematic masterpieces on a magnificent scale.  My issue with the battle scenes is that there are a lot of them.  I mean, a LOT of them.  Their grandness grows old after the fifth time or so.  The supporting cast is outstanding (Sophie Marceau as Princess Isabelle and Patrick McGoohan as the malicious Longshanks in particular).  Mel is quite good as well, though he can often delve into overacting, and his Scottish accent thickens and thins continually throughout the film.  (No one from the film received an Oscar nod for acting.) \n\nOverall this is a very fine film.  I started it at 1:00 a.m. in the morning expecting to stop half way though and pick it up the next day.  But once I was into it, I had to see it through to the end\u2026 three hours later!  That's a big compliment overall.  It was exciting, offered some absolutely stunning scenery, and the story was a compelling one.  With that said, while the film is about actual people who fought for the independence of Scotland, the story itself is highly fictionalized.  It was a vanity project for Mel for sure, and in my personal opinion, Apollo 13 was a more worthy contender for the Best Picture award that year.",

The problem lies in much of the history portrayed and at times away from the fighting it's not as compelling. The relationship between the princess and Wallace does not seem real. Mel Gibson is more a figure than an actor, which works at times. His accent is not always perfect. The king has many cliche parts of a baddie and we see only one side of him. Freedom is a powerful message for the film and we completely understand this. Wallace uses revenge from his wife's murder too help him become a powerful violent leader of men. The violence is a lot with many moments almost wanting us to be shocked. From the many hangings, many men being burned and men being butchered. The fighting is real and raw compared with  many scenes which don't. The love between Wallace and his wife is sweet. The Scottish Nobel men scenes could and should have been better. You can understand why men follow him with his passion. Not deserving of best picture but the music, locations and fighting scenes are well done.",

It is righteous and well intentioned in trying to convince viewers that Scottish should be a free and independent country separate from Great Britain after their centuries of tyranny. Gibson accomplishes entertaining the audience with the goriest war battles with swords, axes, lances, hammers, arrows, and horses clashing on the field. But what I continue to admire most about Braveheart is Gibson's patriotic tone towards Scotland considering he himself is Australian.\n\nBraveheart's battles are truly impressive. Swords hack off limbs, lances thrust into the cavalry's horses, axes penetrate skulls, hammers pound faces, arrows pierce armor and flesh alike, and scores of extras sprint full speed towards chaos. Gibson captures the insanely chaotic sphere of medieval combat. There are so many people fighting that it could be easy to lose focus, but Gibson keeps you exhilarated with finely focused blade combat. I think the 2 major battles within Braveheart remain some of the most visceral war sequences in any film.\n\nNotably, Braveheart is notorious for Mel Gibson stretching the truth, getting facts wrong, and putting in historically inaccurate era items in Braveheart for the sake of entertaining audiences. I can forgive him this as Braveheart is still a finely directed film. I do feel the need to mention some of these points for the sake of honesty. William Wallace was apparently 6 feet and 5 inches tall at least, closer to 7 feet tall, whereas Mel Gibson is 5 feet and 10 inches tall.\n\nFurthermore, the Scottish people did not wear that cool blue war paint at that point, nor did they have kelts yet. James Horner's score is rising and sweeps you into the middle of the fray or across Scottish natural highlands. However, the bagpipes used in the score are not from the era depicted. There are several more significant changes in regards to historical figures, but this has been covered to death already, so I shall leave it at that. Again, Braveheart is amazing in nearly every other area other than accuracy.\n\nAnyways, Mel Gibson is gripping as the Scottish folk hero and historical martyr William Wallace. His dramatic, romantic, and leadership acting give Wallace the respect and brave persona he earned in life. Brendan Gleeson is excellent and endearing as the massive and mighty Hamish. Catherine McCormack is lovely and sweet as Wallace's wife Murron. Sophie Marceau is gorgeous and interesting as Princess Isabelle.\n\nLikewise, Patrick McGoohan's King Edward is one of cinema's most fearsome and cruel villains. Angus Macfayden is fascinating as Robert the Bruce. Although he was William Wallace's ally, Braveheart makes him the temporary traitor for narrative purposes. This is dishonest as well as inaccurate, but Macfayden is outstanding portraying this complex figure.\n\nTo conclude, Braveheart is rife with historical inaccuracies and mistakes, but Gibson's acting and direction will keep you engaged for the entirety of Braveheart's massive run-time.",

The production design, direction and musical score is fantastic but the writing, performances, historical inaccuracies and length cause the film to be just an average popcorn flick and not an epic on the level of Ben-Hur (1959). Seeing Mel Gibson on the big screen causes a very different reaction today than it probably did in 1995 but I must admit that he is a good director and that this film is worth your time if you want to see a big, dumb action movie involving a loose interpretation of historical events.\n\nWilliam Wallace, Mel Gibson, returns to Scotland as an adult after having left the country with his uncle due to the English invasion. He leads a revolt against the English after they murder his wife Murron, Catherine McCormack, and he becomes a Scottish folk hero after his many victories. As they fight and win various battles the King of England, \"Longshanks\", Patrick McGoohan, contends with his gay son Edward, Peter Hanly, and the powerful Scottish army. Robert the Bruce, Angus Macfadyen, is another Scottish leader but his allegiances may be tenuous and Isabella, Sophie Marceu, the wife of Edward, becomes William's second love interest.\n\nThe entire plot is incredibly clich\u00c3 (C) and the moment at which Wallace yells \"freedom\" as he is being drawn and quartered really puts the icing on the cake. It draws you in better than Gladiator (2000) though and his folksy band of friends are set up well even though it is clear they were written to appeal to mid-1990s teenage boys not to represent how Wallace's real life friends would have been. The scenes of battle are genuinely rousing and Gibson is able to pull off the righteous, powerful speeches that his character must give before battle to inspire his troops. Unless it's Gone with the Wind (1939) I am not expecting a deep character study and this film does have a flat, near flawless protagonist whose journey is essentially linear but Gibson has enough movie star charisma to carry the film. The whole film works in an odd way despite it's very obvious flaws and I appreciated the gung-ho approach that those making this film took.\n\nThe film's score is as unabashedly over the top as the rest of the film as James Horner brings out the pipes at every possible moment. Most of the film is extremely dramatic and features the music blaring loud over shots of angry Scottish faces and I will admit that it works although Horner is no Miklos Rosza. John Toll, of Legends of the Fall (1994) fame, does the cinematography and the film does appropriately capture the beautiful green environment of Scotland. The film looks expensive as the costumes, locations and aerial shots feel fitting for a lavish period drama and despite not impressing me as much they would have divorced from Lawrence of Arabia (1962) and Cavalcade (1933) I was pleasantly surprised to find that Gibson had attention to detail.\n\nThe problem that this film shares with Gladiator is it's awkward handling of love interests as we get two of them in this film and neither of them receive enough screen time for us to care about. During his death scene we cut back and forth between them, he envisions Murron, and I couldn't help thinking, what? We are meant to believe that part of his motivation for revolting is the attempted rape and murder of Murron but when he begins a relationship with Isabella it just felt uncomfortable. Both love scenes were very awkward as the first was shot as though in music video style and when we see Isabella lovingly touch her breasts while reminiscing about her night with him it elicited laughter instead of causing me to swoon. I'm not expecting a Douglas Sirk film from a movie clearly made for the boys but I wanted something more from a film judged to be the best film released within a calendar year.\n\nThis is one of the more watchable films I've seen so far in my quest, try watching Hamlet (1948), however that doesn't mean that I objectively liked it and although I would call it a good film it's never great. I would have rewarded Babe (1995) a sweet film that packs a surprising emotional punch.",

Mel Gibson is a talented artist and anyone saying \"Oh, he's a pretty boy\" should watch Braveheart to get an idea. Braveheart was responsible for an increase in tourism to Scotland as well as a new interest in the country's history. All reasons point towards a very well thought out and executed production.

I'm glad the Scots fought back. Wallace was born to be an inspirational leader. To be able to change the minds of hundreds of people ready to die for there country and lead them in to battle is pretty daunting. It's really infuriating to see such a ruthless and selfish king who has no care for human lives.  \n\nThere was definitely no shortage of extras used in this movie. It's such terrible and useless thing, war. It solves nothing, it just breeds more war and violence and death. The look on his face when he finds out the leader was working for the English, it was so sad and disheartening. It was almost like he had lost all hope. I'm glad Long shanks died a torturous death in agony and never got what he wanted as his dying wish.\n\nThis is a bloody good war and battle movie about the unjust ways of the English and how they treated there fellow neighbors the Scottish and how royalty and government can be so treacherous, malicious, and ruthless. Moral of the story: never turn your back on your country and always fight for what's right, if your going to fight. \n\nThis movie was so damn good that those 177 minutes went by quick.

That's in large part due to Mel Gibson's remarkable and risk-taking direction, and the masterful editing.\n\nLong shots, wide camera angles, and quick cuts in the dialogue scenes as well as the battle sequences gave this movie a lively atmosphere, and therefore made it a unique experience that helped it to stand out from the other historical epic movies.\n\nThat being said, I found the tonal shifts completely outputting. The movie kept moving from a somber to a lighter tone throughout its runtime to match the current situations and events. That made some important moments have less impact on me, such as; some dramatic moments didn't work as mush as it should, the climax of the plot felt sudden and not well prepared for it, etc. While it didn't take me a long time to adapt to the new tone, the episodic nature of the movie is quite annoying and distracting.\n\nThe romantic relationship between Wallace and his wife was pretty fine and acceptable at first, but then it overstayed its welcome a little bit. Whilst the reason for that is quite understandable, I couldn't help but cringe for a while.\n\nThe villain is very menacing and almost everything about him is great, except that he provided us with an exposition of his plans many times. But, fortunately, likewise some cheesy lines, these scenes were justified by Gibson's excellent direction that gave them an epic sense, and therefore made them more passable.\n\nRandall Wallace's screenplay is more than enough to make the movie match its ambition. From the way we witness our protagonist from his childhood to become the hero he is, to the miraculous narrative control on the abundance of side characters and their sub-plots. All that made Braveheart a larger-than-life historical tale, and I don't care about how historically accurate it is because it's a great movie!\n\n(8/10)",

When we see bravery has always been in our family and taught to us at a young age. When we lived and seen in the age of the bravest man to fight for land to share stories that you needed to be there fighting along his side. When we see that are aim is true when we must one day fight. When what we see scare us when we don't know. When we see in our dreams that we are given the courage to fight and take the path.  When we see that we have to take care of ourselves when our family leaves to fight. When our eyes are too young to fight and see death too soon. When we see that others are still looking out for us long after they are gone to have someone look after us and see us through to manhood. When we see that we are brave but not a fighter and must learn. When we see the importance of fighting, rich in tradition and rituals that long look after those whom sacrifice their life for this land. When we see its not much but a token of gratitude for what they do for our people. When we can see that we are in need of happiness after death. When we see that we must leave our old life behind. When we see that others are not ready to take what is handed to us, when we see they have other people in mind. When we see that we are becoming unreliable when they don't see the importance of our duties to send others to do our work. When we see on the greater good for our countries well being. When we see we must rule sternly when others take lightly of whom we are and what we do. When we see how vicious and ruling we are when we want something's out. When we see that we must return back where we are needed. When we see that see that we go unnoticed when we have a strong family name. When we see that we must show that we have always been strong and brave when proving ourselves worthy. When we see that we must wait for other things we need to prove for when others are in need of us. When we see that everything has to wait when we are ruled over and have to give or suffer consequences. When we see that we are all brave but must give what is asked of us to keep the peace. When we can clearly see how life has gotten worse since we last returned. When we have always seen life out here has always been a challenge when we live outlands. When we see that not everything is a challenge when we have been keen on one another for along time.  When we see that we are not just a beautiful face, when we know and been everywhere. When we see that is it feels right to be at home with our people. When we don't see why others took the leap into our arms. When we do see that it is just feels right when we recall a moment we shared together. When we see that he is right man to fight for this land when it's in our blood. When we see that we must prove ourselves to other people to get what we want. When we see that we rather settle down and live peacefully with someone for the rest of our lives. When we see that we must hide in order to be together. When we see that we must do it wrong by doing it right when it feels right, but don't care when we love someone. When we can't wait to see each other again when we are hiding our love from others. When we see we must flee where we are mistreated. When see that we must show others disobedience of unlawfulness goes unpunished. When we can't see our loved ones where they ought to be. When we see we must return to face those and see our loved ones again. But what they don't see is we don't give up so easily without a fight. When we see we must give them a fight in order for them to leave us alone. When we see we are much stronger together and our aim is all the same mighty & true.  When we see they are no match more our strength when we have them cornered. When we see we don't show no mercy to those whom don't show us any. When we see that we must lose another love, family to our enemies. When we see that we owe ourselves to those whom we have taken. When we see that nothing can bring those back. When we see we must pay respects to our win to what we stand for. When we see life is done differently down here when there is little to live on. When see that news spreads of this great victory that others share this victory as well. When what others don't see might cost them more then their life but their right to stay here. When we are seen as not ruthless as others in sparing some people. When we see that others don't see the way we see it, that we can't let others see how we really feel about how we displease those whom don't see eye to eye with us when we are handing our reigns to them and we see they are unfit and blind. When we see we are displeased with certain unions when we are living with such ruthless people, but we stay for the sake of our countries prosperity. When we see that we want others gone whom we are arranged to be with. When we see we must not allow such acts go unpunished and show whom is the ruler and powerful. When we see that we too can match power for power, when we defeat each challenge we face. When what they don't see and take our message of surrendering will suffer consequences. When we see that news of our rebellion has spread. When we must seek guidance from those whom have the greater interests of the people than any rebellion. When we see how inspiring some people are in what they stand for, that challenges our perspectives. When we see that we all wish to have the same courage as others do, but we are of different places when we are given titles and land that gives us the opportunity to live in parts others not wish to be in. When we see something in this man and people that we haven't seen before that changes our minds. When we see others not as others when we wish not to compromise a good thing that we currently have. When we see that our power and direction can go elsewhere that safens our livelihood. When we see that we need more fighters to handle a problem. When we only need to make people see ourselves as a powerful person. When we are close enough with our own people to know they are all wrong, in love and livelihood. When we don't need to see some people but hear how loving they are in how they see the world and what matters to them for us to see they are right for us. When what others don't see, we see when we know all too well their plans. When we see we could use all the men we could get. When we don't see what others see when they are not right in the head. When they don't see that some sides we prefer and are backstabbers. When we see that we must watch each other's backs when we have to pay our loyalties to the side that hates another side as much as we do. When what others don't see we get right past them.  When we see that we must fight a different way smarter and surprising that they don't expect. When we need see everywhere when we got eyes scattered. When we see we are out matched, outnumbered and the odds are not in our favor. When we see that we have no faith in leaders whom don't know and show they are not fit to lead. When we see there are others fit to lead, when their reputation proceeds them, a fearless warrior you would be honoured to fight beside and along side. When we see that we must fight for 1 thing that we both share and set aside our differences. When we see we must be the face they bare, the heart they hold and courage that they march on fighting for something they believe in, a free land that is not for others to rule. When we don't see whom they are seeing, but doing our duty as we are instructed. When we see that we must act civilly and accordingly when the terms of war ask of it. When we see we don't share in the same terms and offer our own terms that we see they wont take but we offered. When we see that we must show we are relentless, fearless and confident of victory, when this war is for all of the dark history this land had to bare and we are putting a stop too. When others don't need to see what others are fighting for, but know what history, stories and ruthlessness that has be done to know what this means. When we see we have no other resolve but to fight. When we see that they must fire first to start a war. When we see weakness we capitalize when we are ruthless. When we see that we are no match that we retreat. When we see we pulled off a miraculous victory. When we see that we are worthy of serving our country with a title, name and backing. When we see what victory means that we are not all fighting for 1 thing but separate things when we there are politics are involved. When we don't see the importance of the politics and designation of rights to continue fighting for a cause. When we don't see that backing involves giving what the people want, to which we can't provide. When we don't see that what makes us weak is that we all have separate needs that we want but are not getting when favors lean more towards opposing sides, and not ours. When we don't see that backing & support involves funding, people, and risking entitlements. When we don't see that our own people see us as weak and wont risk what little they have for the greater importance. When we must see ourselves as proven fighters that are victorious in battle to gain support by how well we plan & win battles. When we must see to it that no one pushes us around that we stand up to them. When we see that we must send a message that we are relentless and won't stop. When we must continuously make others see how ruthless we are that we won't be taken lightly. When what we see is just a dream when our thoughts remain with them. When we are seen taken lightly when we are sent a princess to send the word of terms. When what others don't see we reveal, when we show that we a person fighting for what is right. When we want to see some people live for we like the sight of some people whom are loving but foolish in thinking they can win. When we see why we are fighting for, that nothing can be given titles and funding that we want but our land to live how we intended all our people to live. When what we see we can't get when we our allegiance is towards the other side.  When we see that peace was never what they had in mind when we are ruthless. When we see our loyalties are both sides when we send word of plans. When we must see that we will get support and backing when we are revealed that there we are out powered, out numbered and out matched again. When we can't see the longevity of our army continuing to fight such numbers when we don't have the support to do so. When what we see uniting together others don't see it succeeding when we can't risk the future of our entitlement for it. When we see a fair fight when our people are banded together to fight the opposing sides. When we see we must fight our own side but don't see that our side rather stick with our side and fight for the opposing side. When we see that the moment to rebel is now and we won't be seen as disloyal and tolerant to invaders whom want to claim our land. When we must be seen as a proven smart and tactical fighter to win our battles and meet with any challenges. When we see that there is no winning a war that  gives us nothing when others give us more. When we see that disloyalty is worth living for when we are given the land but not the rights to it. When we see all our support and backing to become victorious and free fade when we are alone and give up. When we betray the very sight of inspiration and courage to get us through to victory. When we see we must not allow others to give up when they are wanted dead, and the dream dead as well. When we see what we want is a dream to become true that we can see a future where its free and able to stand on its own without the support of another country whom is wealthier, powerful, and stronger. When we see our actions have cost the lives of so many people's dreams and hopes whom braved and fought and died for their country.  When we see that we must take revenge on those whom betray us and our country when they remain alongside the enemy. When we can no longer see the man whom has to be unseen when his own people betray him and now has to fight alone. When we see the dream fade, but the story and legend of the man grow when all what is already accomplished have inspired many from across the land. When we must be seen ruthless without any land or cause when that dream remains, but reality fades when we are wanted. When we need to see the vary thing that we ever known what love is supposed to personify to not give up on those whom we need but can't have. When we see we are drawing closer to letting something's go, love, family, dreams, land, entitlements, power and livelihoods. When what we see we wish we could change when we no longer want to be part of any disloyalty and betrayal when it's not right not to fight on the right side when it counts, when its not right not to have our own land, when its not right when we can lend support and backing that we are not there to give to the most fearless and courageous man this land has to know. When we see our loyalty lays with yours, but can't see that others betray on our behalf. When we don't see how long can we keep the lands that are handed down to us to only have it taken away. When we can't see the price of lives when our name and titlements are more important then a dream, or others names and titlements. When we can't see the self-greed to put forth our own gratifications forward ahead of others.  When we can't see that no one cares about the land, but what it gives for us. When we can't see that there are people whom idealize, respect and love a person whom is unlike any person with power that is worthy of any title, any land, any support, any funding and any name when he has a great heart for a land and people it wishes to see have a future. When we must show how brave and strong we are to reject anything less but land or death. When we can't see how weak we are seen being defeated so many times by 1 savage man. When we see how much we wish others to die when they make us lose our power and livelihood. When we see that in different places, we are treated less when we are just a spectacle and entertainment for those to see in pain for being on the opposing side. When we see some people have accepted the way life is and continue to be when they don't have a dream worth dieing for. When we see that our name won't live on when we never had the opportunity to bare an heir to pass on. When we see that we will never get to see a future where our children can grow on. When we see that we can't live knowing we abandon our dreams when our family, love and own people never abandon it neither. When what we can't see we hold onto with every breath to see that they lived long enough to see dead. When we can all see how much this dream means to this man, able to do so much, take as much pain, and keep hanging on to the livelihood that one day he can live in land where it's free. When we can see we will carry the dream till death. When we can't wait to see the vary thing in our dreams once again.  When we can see how ruthless they treated a treason person after death and make little of all what he stood for. When we can see clearly what the man inspired in all people to continue in his brave steps, keep his stories and dream alive, that we never trade all worldly possessions for anything other then land we wish to keep our own, our own name, our own culture, our own traditions, and our own people. When we see ourselves in that one man when we fight every battle and fight for our freedom. \n\nVisuals-5\nDirecting-5\nMusic-5\nScreenplay-5\nActing-5\nLevel of Interest-5\nComplexity-5\nTiming-5\nTwist & Turns-5\nMessage-5\nHistorical Accuracy-5",

Mel Gibson stated Braveheart's multiple creative liberties were taken for dramatic purposes and when you consider he was able to hold our attention with a 14th century historical epic for nearly three hours, no one can argue it wasn't to the film's benefit. Gibson plays up the legend of William Wallace at the expense of accuracy, but never realism, wrenching out all the thrills and bloodspills he can in this rowdy medieval epic. If you leave entertained and moved by the sweeping action, drama and romance and intrigued enough to research how history actually took place, then Braveheart has already justified it's legendary status.",

            "content": "In the realm of historical drama, filmmakers are often faced with a dilemma; do they keep as historically accurate as possible for authenticity or do they buck this trend in favour of making their stories as epic and dramatic as possible. Braveheart is a fine example of how using the latter technique can result in a brilliant and timeless film that transports the audience into a rich setting and never let's go.\n\nBraveheart is the tale of William Wallace (Mel Gibson), a Scottish warrior and hero in the thirteenth century; his people have been subjected to ruthless oppression by the English led by King Edward \"LongShanks\" ever since he was a boy and he soon gets his reason to fight; after his wife Murron (Catherine McCormack) is killed by English soldiers, Wallace takes up a sword and rallies the Scots to fight for their freedom. Along the way, the born leader and his band of brothers take the fight to the enemy by unconventional means, as well as bringing figures such as Robert the Bruce (Angus Macfadyen) to their cause. Adapted from the epic poem \"The Actes and Deidis of the Illustre and Vallyeant Campioun Schir William Wallace\" by Blind Harry, Braveheart launches full-on into an vast, varied and engaging tale of valour and courage. The film is excellently paced, sprinkling in great amounts of vicious battles and subdued drama; and with a brilliant and timeless hero at its centre, you'll be rooting for and engaged with Wallace more and more as the film goes on, something which modern films struggle to do nowadays. Of course the film isn't completely historically accurate, but by moving away from this the filmmakers were able to produce a plot that not only keeps the audience invested from start to finish, but also manages to translate very well to the big screen.\n\nThe characters of this grand tale are mostly very well-rounded and developed. At the centre is Mel Gibson as William Wallace, an excellent and all-around likeable lead; he possesses a strong and determined mind-set and yet despite his tough exterior, he is shown to be a man who is forced to adapt and cope with losses of every kind. Wallace's main companions (played by Brendan Gleeson and David O'Hara amongst others) provide a good mixture of drama and light comic relief which play off Gibson very well. On the opposing side, we have King Edward \"Longshanks\" (Patrick Mcgoohan), a truly ruthless dictator who makes for a great antagonist; just as the audience follows Wallace, so too do they hope for the villain to be taken down a notch, which makes for a great conflict. Other side characters also make an impression by going along their personal journeys over the course of the film; Isabella of France (Sophie Marceau) starts off as a bargaining chip, hopeless to have any influence on her husband and the domineering king, but as things go on, she becomes more daring and willing to defy conventions. Likewise Robert the Bruce is constantly torn between his claim to the Scottish throne and loyalty to his fellow kinsman, making for an interesting plotline of morality. The only real issue I had with the cast was that some of the characters could have had more time to develop; for instance \"Longshank's\" son Prince Edward (Peter Hanly) has an interesting role, but his character doesn't contribute as much to the proceedings over the course of the film.\n\nBefore modern films utilised CGI to make their battles seem much large and expansive in scale, films had to make do with extras and good camera work to set them apart and in terms of sheer spectacle, Braveheart is in a class of its own with its portrayal of medieval combat. It's really intense stuff, with quick cuts between the two sides and some brutal killing blows; it's also interesting how the film's combat is devoid of music, allowing the clashing of swords and shields to be much more impactful. The film is also leaps and bounds ahead in its portrayal of the setting and characters; the vast landscapes of Scotland viewed from afar are some of the most beautiful sights you'll ever see in a historical drama whilst the make-up and costumes are very well designed to clearly define the English and Scottish armies. The music features a traditional and authentic bagpipe score placed against an emotive main theme which brings a surprising amount of poignancy to the Scot's struggle. Suffice it say, there's little in Braveheart that doesn't work alongside the story and characters to draw the viewer in to its stunning world.\n\nI can say without a shadow of doubt that Braveheart is epic in every sense of the word; it's well rounded characters, beautiful music and visceral combat all come together to make it one of the best historical dramas, even nearly twenty years later. Historians will no doubt continue to cry foul at its numerous inaccuracies, but for the rest of us, it remains an utterly captivating and enthralling adventure.",

Did you know that Mel Gibson is best friends with Robert Downey Jr? Anyways, Braveheart takes place in Scotland in the middle ages and starts from Williams childhood for a while and then jumps to the start of his journey as an adult to his execution. This is certainly a movie in which you can get a lot of emotions and conflicts from. There seriously are a lot of conflicts, as there always is with politics and war, for example, Scotland wants independence from England, the English's typical racism toward the Scott's, their unforgiving nature for the English, Will wanting to make his former watching wife proud, the English princesses struggle, etc. The Protagonist, William Wallace, is a freedom Fighter who begins to fight and lead men against the English in vengeance of his executed wife. The Antagonist, King Edward, is dictator that would like nothing better than to have the Scott's wiped from existence without getting caught. Despite it being based off of a true story, a fair bit of accurate history was discarded for entertainment value, nice one Mel.\n\tBut make no mistake the braveheart movie is very entertaining. The acting is excellent and is most likely Mel Gibson at his best. As for the Scottish accents, well, they do sound Scottish, but they don't sound like a native person would talk, sounds like an American Accent masked over with a Scottish. The music in the movie that always sets the setting and really brings out the Scottish culture in you. The cinematography of it is very good but it's not perfect, there are times you'll find yourself leaning over for a better view. Some moments though are dead on like the slow motion added on the beheading swing for William which really adds some sacredness to it. They are many scenes the defiantly make it worth the long running time and wait like the standoff for the first battle when they have the blue paint on their faces, which has comically been added to other movies. The scene where the young Murron hands young Wallace a flower at his dad's funeral and they fall in love there sort of. Anyway, there's lots of good scenes. Mel Gibson did a good job on this film, if you don't like this movie it's because it's just not your type of genre.\n\tPersonally, I think it's a good movie but it's not thee movie, you know. It has inconsistent history which was made to make the British king look more like a villain. It is sad to first the father dies, then his wife dies and then he dies, reality is sad sometimes. Plus how much of a hero is Wallace really if he's going around and killing people who probably have families and children and are just following orders probably in fear of their own life. Go the Scottish let every single English person burn in hell though, right? It does seem to have a little of a double standard there, that's why there is heroes and then there is war heroes. The sets throughout the movie though are absolutely amazing, it really does authentically look like they're in the middle Ages, and the costumes are also excellent. That's why I would only give this story a 3 and a half star rating, but that's just what I personally think.",

It lingers too long on Wallace as a youth, then really rushes the romance.  Despite this, the pacing works well enough to keep your attention throughout the entire three hours.  This is largely due to the incredible action scenes.  \"Braveheart\" has some truly epic action sequences, and Mel Gibson delivers as the star.  Mel Gibson gives the best performance of his career, demanding your attention, and I also liked Brendan Gleeson's supporting role.\n\n\"Braveheart\" is a really enjoyable historical war drama.  It is brutal and exciting during the action, and is tender during its romantic moments.  While it's far from perfect, \"Braveheart\" is an exciting film with a lot of heart (no pun intended).",

I'd most likely have to say that it's because I've seen this type of storyline before, done better no less, in Gladiator and subsequently couldn't help but compare the two and Gladiator has everything this film has, and in spades.

Every time he's onscreen, he dominates with a commanding performance, and you are 100% invested in everything that happens to him.  It's not just his show, though, and I really don't think the supporting cast is given enough due credit here.

This epic adventure follows the first war of the Scottish Independence, and it should be understood by any potential viewer that this movie has said to be one of the most historically inaccurate films of all time. The movie opens on a little boy, William Wallace, watching his father and brother leave to attend a meeting of Scottish nobles, hosted by the infamous King of England, Edward Longshanks. William follows his father and brother to the meeting where they see that Longshanks has had all of the Scottish nobles hung, what they see will spark the revolution against England. Shortly after, William's father attends another meeting, a meeting where it is decided that Scotland will officially go to war against the English for the freedom and majesty of the Scottish people. The young William Wallace is forced to stay and \"mind the farm\" while his father and brother go to war, and he does exactly that until word comes that both his father and brother have been killed in the battle. Ten years later an adult William Wallace returns to his birth town with the intent to settle down and to avoid the revolution that took his family's life. But when William kills a guard that was trying to force himself on his wife, she is decapitated in the middle of the square, from that moment his small revolution triggered the great revolution of Scotland, for a fire was lit inside of Wallace that could only be quenched by the freedom of his land from tyranny, and the rest is history. The most significance theme is, the source of compromise, greed and treachery and being able to understand that in life you should not have to compromise for the things that you truly desire. Greed is supported most obviously when William Wallace is offered lands, and titles, and enough gold to live comfortably for the rest of his life. But William is unfazed, because his goal is worth more than any man could ever give him. He makes a decision that nothing short than his goal would ever suffice for him. Treachery can be supported in more ways than one, firstly it can be said that there can be a treachery of oneself, merely by giving up on one's dream or goal there is treachery being committed. Secondly, treachery is shown again, and again, by the betrayal of William's friends, the theme that treachery and greed are negative is reinforced because when William is betrayed those that broke his trust either die, or realize the error of their ways. With any form of literature, it can be considered effective if it makes the viewer feel, whether they feel love, happiness, sadness, anger is the only true testament as to what should be considered art. Braveheart does just that, you feel excitement and a sense of urgency as the two great armies clash; you feel the sorrow of William as his wife is killed in front of him, you are drawn in to the Scott's passion for their land and their honor, this is the impact of Braveheart and this is why it is art. The best quote of this entire movie is when William Wallace addresses his army, he says, \"would you be willin' to trade all the days, from this day to that, for one chance, just one chance, to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they'll never take... our freedoms\" This quote is brilliant because it is saying that no matter what somebody does in their lives they should do it without any regrets and they should do it to the best of their abilities, this is just one example of how this movie can impact you. I truly enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to anyone.",

            "content": "For the fourth quarter my group and I did our IR project on the film Braveheart (1995). The movie started off very slow I even considered turning it off. The story follows a young boy named William. His father ends up dying at a young age in the line of battle. William's uncle shows up days after to take William away from his home in Scotland. Eventually the years pass and William returns back to Scotland as a young man. He is greeted by his old friend as they begin a rock throwing competition like they used to do when they were kids. Eventually he spots his old childhood love in the crowd. He approaches her and they begin to catch up. Then the classic love story begins. They sneak around her parents and sneak off in the night. They realize they loved each other and never stopped since William left Scotland. William realizes he wants to marry this girl but her father will not give him permission unless he becomes a warrior and fights for Scotland. William has not intensions in fighting because he believes in peace since his father had been killed in battle. He ends up marrying the girl secretly then they end up sharing their love for each other in the woods. The next day an English guard sees William and her kiss the guard wants to have sexual intercourse with Williams mate. She ends up being snagged and almost raped. She ends up biting the guard's ear which lets her get away only for a short time. She ends up being caught by the English and then is killed on a stake by having her neck slit. This enrages William making him want to kill he begins to start a rebellion with all the villagers. Then it becomes your classic story of man loses his love and then goes on a killing spree. I consider this literature due to the fact that it has such a good storyline. I consider this to be literature also due to the face that it has symbolism just like the books we have read this year. I consider William the Christ figure. People in the town of Scotland look up to William as people looked up to Jesus. William is a savior and would die for his people. He risks himself to give his people what they want. Jesus was crucified so people could sin but still go to heaven like they wanted. The town also followed William in any actions her took. They say books are the only form of literature but this movie definitely has a spot in the literature section with its gripping story line and amazing symbolism. I would give this movie a 4 out of 5 stars.",

            "content": "Out of concern for my own well being, let me begin by noting what I liked about this movie. It shall even warrant its own paragraph. Good performances, suitable editing. I liked how the dream sequences were shot, as well as the battles. I'm reading the critical consensus on RT, and it starts by calling the movie, \"Distractingly violent and historically dodgy.\" Personally, the violence was the best aspect of this movie, and dodging historical accuracy may have been for the better. The scenery is beautiful, and I liked the bagpipe score that fueled the Scottish pride.\n\nDespite all of that, fuck this Oscar-baiting, testosterone-tickling, non-descript garbage. A movie like The Fast and the Furious is brave enough to admit that it's action porn, while the original Star Wars trilogy had the style AND substance to justify indulging in what are now classic film cliches. Braveheart, meanwhile, fails to be anything other than an achingly long action movie. There isn't a single fight until about an hour into Braveheart, and that's just one THIRD of the whole mess. Trust me, I generally love drama more than action, but when drama extends as far as hopeless love and mindless vengeance, it all seems too juvenile for my taste. And the movie knows this! That's why we are rewarded with what few lighthearted moments exist, such as William Wallace (Mel Gibson) and his Scottish army mooning the English enemies after being attacked by the English archers. Comedic panning worked! Unfortunately, however, all that Braveheart cares about is disguising the theme of fighting for manliness as a theme of fighting for freedom. How else can one explain Princess Isabelle (Sophie Marceau)'s contradictory swooning for Wallace's spark to fight -- the murder of his barely true love -- and head-over-heels love for the man himself? It's weird. Even weirder is the rag motif that Mel Gibson, also the director, wanted to choke the audience with. He doesn't seem to understand that an audience can think for itself, so he stretches the most morally challenging moments of the movie (none actually exist, mind you) to noticeably long durations until we too become the barbarians that fight alongside Wallace. I'm not disagreeing with what the movie wanted to tell, for nothing was told anyway. I'm glad that I watched a mediocre movie. I don't do that enough, these days.",

            "content": "\"They may take our lives, but they'll never take our freedom!\"  Deserved the Best Picture Oscar despite being very inaccurate, but is a historically inaccurate masterpiece.  Based off Blind Harry's epic poem The Actes and Deidis of the Illustre and Vallyeant Campioun Schir William Wallace, Braveheart follows William Wallace, a 13th-century Scottish warrior, leading the Scots against the British in a fight for independence during the First War of Scottish Independence against King Edward I of England.  This film does an amazing job at being one of the most historically inaccurate films of all time, and being a great war film at the same time, some a unique quality in filmmaking.  The film has nonstop diverges from history, but no one cares (I do a bit though) as all of that is replaced by moments of action, drama, and romance which help keep audiences interested throughout the outrageously long run time of two hours, fifty-seven minutes and incredibly graphic violence, and it succeeds while also putting in a very detailed work on war, which of course includes graphic violence, personal conflicts, and conflicts between enemies to input realism into the picture.  Randall Wallace is able to capture the dark and complex sides of war in his script, despite not staying true to history, but everyone forgets about that anyway (except historians and maybe the Scottish (not trying to be mean)).  Mel Gibson is able to bring the script to the big screen by finding the right locations for battle sequences, and what 13th-century Scotland should look like.  The Battle of Stirling is one of the best action sequences ever made, with numerous death and ultra violence included to avoid playing anything safe.  The acting is good,  especially with Gibson in the role of William Wallace, and a very talented cast to support him.  James Horner composes a beautiful score that captures the mood of each scene, and John Toll does a stellar job at expertly shooting each scene without any flaws.  A must-see, although I won't say the same for historians.",

Mel Gibson does an incredible job directing and acting here. His character is a character you care and root for the entire well paced 3 hour movie. James Horner's score is one of this film's greatest strengths and it succeeds at making scenes emotional and entralling to watch. John Toll's cinematography is outstanding here and you get fantastic shots of Ireland and Scotland. I don't care that the film may have historical inaccuracies, when I watch a film, I don't ask for a history lesson, I just ask to be entertained about what is going on and to give me characters that I will care for. This in my opinion ends up being a movie that lives up to all its hype and Best Picture win because you can tell that the filmmakers put their best effort into making this wonderful picture.",

'Braveheart' managed to sweep through with romance, drama and war. An undeniably immense picture, it is one of few epics that could possibly move millions. The film grabbed five academy awards including best picture.\r\n\r\nIn my personal opinion, the most memorable element of 'Braveheart' is it's music, which was being composed by the talented James Horner. I have to admit that I am slightly puzzled with it; at times it feels like a genuine Scottish music, but also at the same time it feels like a plain modern music, but either way it is beautiful. I am going to put aside any sense of familiarity here, but whenever the music is being played, my love for this film grows. Also, I honestly believe that if this charming music is absent, the picture would not be so memorable.\r\n\r\nActing performances are good, but not outstanding. Patrick McGoohan's work for this film did hold my attention. He played the main villain of the story named King Edward \"Longshanks\". Surely, what excites me was his approach for the character; a cool, quiet, and methodically behaved, and at the same time, a cold and violent human being. He might be labelled as coward or a hypocrite, but assuredly, this \"Longshanks\" character is a pretty good villain.\r\n\r\nThe film has great cinematography too. Shots are so subtle and are near perfection. Hands down, the movie is being effectively photographed. Battle sequences are so well executed, and one fact that I massively admire about this film is that there is no CGI involved. Unlike some modern war films, fighting scenes are so believable and engaging, and yes, realism is there. Absolutely, these mentioned praises would be missing without Mel Gibson's precious direction.\r\n\r\nA major let-down would be the inconsistency which lies in the contents of the story. I would be reluctant to mention specifically on which part of the plot is flawed, but they are simply too abrupt, unbelievable and most importantly, overly dramatic. It tastes like it's storyline is being shifted away from the right track.\r\n\r\n'Braveheart' is one of those few films that is so ambitious and sets it's bar so high, and delivered. Handsomely mounted, 'Braveheart' is positively one of the most memorable films of 1990s.\r\n\r\n[3/4]",

            "content": "I couldn't remember if I had seen Braveheart all the way through, until I watched it last night and I remembered that I had seen Braveheart in its entirety. Braveheart is masterfully directed by Mel Gibson, who also plays our her, William Wallace in the film. Braveheart's Scottish backdrop is never anything but breath taking. The battle scenes are expertly filmed, as well as overly gruesome. Gibson rarely hides the bloodshed and we are forced to face it in all of its horror.\n\nThough it has a nearly three hours running time, I never lost interest in this wonderful mythology of the legendary Wallace. It is always beautiful, mostly tragic, and sometimes comic. Braveheart's themes of freedom and patriotism are always present, no one will leave this movie lost. It is sometimes on the nose in its dialogue and iconic visual moments, more subtlety would have been nice. In the end Braveheart is certainly a crowd pleaser. \n\nActing: The acting is very strong here, we learn to love each named character, though we may not always remember his or her names, we know them like good friends. The performances are solid, but nothing truly stuck out for me.\n8/10\n\nVisuals: Braveheart is more of a modern epic than anything else in its cinematography and that isn't a bad thing. There were consistent set dresses and costuming that I really enjoyed. Great special effects and makeup as well.\n9.5/10\n\nStory: A really wonderful story, maybe not as tight as it could have been, but I loved all the extra scenes we got, nothing seemed too out of place. Often we got great scenes that would have been full of subtexts, had they not been so on the nose in their dialogue. It's a shame.\n8/10\n\nConcept: I love how Mel Gibson chose to make a movie about the legend of Wallace and not a long history lesson. We don't know too many specifics on the hero from history and that's ok.\n9/10\n\nPersonal: I seemed to really develop a relationship for the characters and wanted to see them gain their freedom. I felt the love, the hate, the patriotism and the disgust. Really well established motivations for each character.\n9.3/10\n\nRe-Watchability: Most re-watchable thing about this is its direction and entertainment value. You also could view for sound too. I will definetly be watching this again.\n9/10\n\n8.8/10",

It\u00e2(TM)s from Director Mel Gibson\u00e2(TM)s 1995 epic historical action drama BRAVEHEART. The film is based on the true story of William Wallace (Mel Gibson), a 13th Century Scottish man and patriot, who rallies his fellow countrymen into liberation with the English and to overthrow King Edward I aka \u00e2Longshanks\u00e2\u009d (Patrick McGoohan \u00e2\" ITV\u00e2(TM)s Secret Agent aka Danger Man). The film also stars Sophie Marceau (007 \u00e2\" The World is Not Enough) as Princess Isabelle of France, Angus Macfadyen (Cradle Will Rock) as 17th Earl Robert the Bruce, Brendan Gleeson (28 Days Later) as William\u00e2(TM)s often short-sighted but thinks with his fists childhood friend Hamish Campbell, Catherine McCormack (Spy Game) as William\u00e2(TM)s wife Murron MacClannough, David O\u00e2(TM)Hara (The Departed) as the fearless Irishman Stephen, James Cosmo (Highlander) as Hamish\u00e2(TM)s father Campbell the Elder, Peter Hanly (BBC\u00e2(TM)s Ballykissangel) as Longshanks\u00e2(TM)s homosexual son Prince Edward of Wales, Ian Bannen (Ghost Dad) as Robert\u00e2(TM)s father The Leper, Tommy Flanagan (Smokin\u00e2(TM) Aces) as Morrison, Alun Armstrong (The Mummy Returns) as Mornay, Michael Byrne (Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade) as Smyth, John Kavanagh (The Black Dahlia) as Craig, Stephen Billington (Resident Evil) as Prince Edward\u00e2(TM)s lover Phillip, John Murtagh (Rob Roy) as Lochlan, Richard Leaf (The Fifth Element) as the Governor of York, and Brian Cox (Manhunter) as William\u00e2(TM)s uncle and Roman catholic priest Argyle Wallace. I\u00e2(TM)ve heard about this movie since it came out when I was six years old. I grew up watching Mel Gibson in other films such as the LETHAL WEAPON movies, and I would never see BRAVEHEART till I was 22. This was Gibson\u00e2(TM)s second film as Director after 1993\u00e2(TM)s THE MAN WITHOUT A FACE and originally was to direct and co-produce BRAVEHEART only, but finally agreed to star in it as well after he couldn\u00e2(TM)t decide who would be the right choice for Wallace. American stuntman Mic Rodgers, who was also Gibson\u00e2(TM)s stuntman from 1984 to 1997, was the stunt coordinator for the battle sequences, including the Stirling battle sequence, which features Gibson saying the famous \u00e2Freedom\u00e2\u009d speech, was shot with nine cameras within a period of six weeks between mid-July and August 1994. Filmed entirely in Scotland and Ireland for five months between June to October of 1994, BRAVEHEART was released on May 24th, 1995. Although the film was at #7 at the box office opening weekend with $2,642,460, and grossing over $75,609,945 worldwide, BRAVEHEART was nominated for 10 Academy Awards at the 68th Academy Awards in 1996, but only won five awards: Mel Gibson for Best Director, John Toll for Best Cinematography, Lon Bender and Per Hallberg for Best Sound Editing; Peter Frampton, Paul Pattison, and Lois Burwell for Best Makeup, and Best Picture. I have seen other historical epic movies such as GLADITATOR, SPARTACUS, and ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES, I found BRAVEHEART to be very entertaining and I really loved James Horner\u00e2(TM)s music for the film. I add BRAVEHEART to that list of historical epics I\u00e2(TM)ve seen. And if you haven\u00e2(TM)t seen it, I recommend it.",

Everything from the musical score to the sweeping landscapes right down the motivational speeches, Braveheart has it all. Mel Gibson really did a good job here and pays tribute to the lives lost in the revolt, even if it is apparently sometimes off with the history but I won't comment on that as I do not know enough about it. All I know is that a film that is three hours long justifies it's running time with exhilarating action, a great plot to get attached to, a powerful heartbreaking theme and some fine acting where it shows that every actor really gave it their all to make something memorable. The action here is quite the spectacle, rewardingly bloody and just remarkable to look at how everything was staged, it's quite incredible. I guess these epics that go on to win Oscars like to use music that has bagpipes in it as the music to me was reminiscent of Titanic and I know that came out two years after this but Horner must have realized that it worked so well so he used it again when he did Titanic but it really fits for some reason and gives everything a great sense of power when it's used, even more so than what's already being shown. Again, it's another one of those films where there really isn't anything but praise to give it so a review just lavishing praise unto it isn't really going to be anything interesting that anyone would want to read. Fantastic film that sweeps you away with it and gets you thoroughly involved, right up until its heartbreaking finale. FREEDOM!",

So much, I would say that I, along with many others, consider it one of my all time favorite movies.\n\n One of the parts of the film that often gets overlooked is that it does have genuine themes and character arcs.  Such ideas being things like how it is both brains and heart in tandem that win out in the end, as well as how one who has the ability to act they cannot just \"sit it out\" so to speak if they want change to happen.

            "content": "This is a movie I really liked back in 1995 when it first came out. It is still my brother's favorite movie of all time - he can recite the entire three hour epic by heart. For me, however, this hasn't aged well. The battle scenes in 1995 set the bar - on first viewing they seemed amazing, nearly twenty years later I've seen much better. Also the mistakes in editing in this movie just drive me absolutely nuts. Footage from one battle gets peppered into other battles, Gibson will be running with the claymore, then with an axe, then the camera cuts again and he has the claymore back. One of the most glaring issues is that Mel Gibson is just a bad actor. He is over the top and hamming it up in every scene. That style works in Lethal Weapon, which is self aware of its over the top nature, but you shouldn't be playing this over the top in a historical fiction piece, even if you are playing as loose with history as Gibson does. It turns drama into melodrama - and with a script that relies on lots of well trod plot turns that's what happens here. Reminds me of Titanic in how it has such mass popular love but little substance to go along with a Best Picture Oscar that will leave future generations scratching their heads. He savages the actual historical account - which I don't dock him for, but just to remind viewers so they don't cite the films fictionalized account as history like I've seen many do. \nIf you took Gibson out of this, streamlined the hokey love story at the beginning, got a decent editor, went a little more historical (i.e. get rid of anachronistic kilts), you could have a really good action film here. Nothing worthy of the ridiculous Best Picture award, but a good genre film. Instead, it's a dated, melodramatic, mess that wastes lots of great aspects behind a lousy leading performance. But like Titanic, Braveheart  will be endlessly defended and loved by its die-hard fans who can forgive its problems because it presses the easy buttons most blockbusters push.",

Nuff said.\r\n\r\nPlot: In the 13th century, King Edward I of England (but really known in this film as Longshanks) invades and conquers Scotland. As a result, young William Wallace faces the death of his father and brother who were leading a rebellion and was taken to be educated by his uncle. He comes home years later where he marries his childhood sweetheart Murron. But when he tries to rescue her from a couple of English soldiers that result in her being publicly executed, he kills all of the soldiers in the village and rounds up fellow Scotsmen to start a way for independence against the English.\r\n\r\nStraight off the bat, I like this movie. I enjoyed the story, I liked the characters, it was big, dramatic, sometimes funny, sometimes sad, and gave us one of the most epic, realistic, and graphic action scenes ever made. Now I have somewhat heard that this movie isn't getting as much praise as it use to, to the point that it's been viewed as the number 1 worst best picture winner as of 2005 according to Empire magazine. Although personally I don't think they really know what they're talking about considering that this is actually a good movie and that as far as their list goes, they don't even put in some of the actual worst like Cimmaron, Out of Africa and Shakespeare In Love. So in my opinion, their argument is invalid. But this film also has a lot of issues with historical inaccuracies. I mean not having some inaccuracies is something that's going to be hard to do anyway since most of what's really known/possibly known about William Wallace is in legend or from the epic poem from 15th century minstrel, Blind Harry. But even I have to admit that some of the inaccuracies make me think \"Okay, this is what was actually going on at the time with this character. This movie is pretty misleading that way.\" But despite that, it's still an enjoyable movie that is still telling us a good story That was well put together. \r\n\r\nAnd that's my review for Braveheart. So I'm getting close to reaching 400 reviews which is exciting. Till then, watch out for some other reviews over the weekend as my family and I are soon to rent a couple of films and take a look at that. So see you then.",

The difference here is that this was not a graphic novel. The cast gives off an authentic Scottish personality, and the story does well to contrast between the Scottish and English forces. The presentation is littered with authentic atmospheric pieces that bring out nature of setting itself. I do question the historical accuracy of it though, especially in the scene where they tie Mel Gibson up on what looks like a cross (could that be an allusion to the Passion of the Christ?), when he was actually hanged, drawn, and quartered.

The battles were great, very gory which I love and realistic. It had enough fights to satisfy you. I really like Mel Gibson as an actor, so many people hate him for his comments and actions he's displayed in life but I don't let that make me judge him as an actor, it doesn't take away from his great skills. So many have loved this movie and I finally got to see it and agree, it is a great film and Gibson did a great job. I really enjoy movies with sword fights and huge battle scenes over gun battles, the fights even reminded me of the Lord of the Rings battles. This movie really even holds up to today, no cheap blood or anything like that. Some may be turned away by it's length but I say just watch it, if you don't get sucked in then turn to something else, at least just give it a chance. Braveheart has one of the best scores a movie could have, I love everything they did with the bagpipes in this movie, it really is a very memorable score that sticks out. This movie really stands out, keeps you entertained with the fights, has it's moments of sadness and doesn't feel like it needs anything more than it already has.",

Not that I have a particular problem with Scottish nationalism, and I support their attempts even today, but I did find it distractingly harsh on the British.\n\nNonetheless, I have no issue with this film winning it's Oscar, and found it immensely enjoyable.",

Starring Mel Gibson, Patrick McGoohan, Sophie Marceau, and Brendan Gleeson, the film has a strong cast that delivers outstanding performances.

            "content": "William Wallace was born into a time of turmoil and bloodshed and power struggles. This story, even though a little on the long side, will keep you in a trance.\n\n\nThis is a star-studded cast! Mel Gibson (The Patriot, Lethal Weapons) plays the freedom-hungry William Wallace, Patrick McGoohan (Esacpe from Alcatraz, Treasure Plant) as the merciless King Edward I/Longshanks, Brendan Gleeson (Troy, Harry Potter movies, 28 Days Later, Cold Mountain) as the burly but beloved Hamish, Sophie Marceau (A Midnight Summer's Dream, Alex & Emma) as the lovely Princess Isabelle, Tommy Flanagan (Gladiator, Sin City) as Morrison, and so many more. \n\n\nLike earlier stated...this is slightly on the long side, but it's so entrancing! From the first minute, you can't take your eyes off the screen. I watched this at 8:30 am and even though I'm exhausted from being awake early with three hours of sleep I don't regret it. Even though I've seen this a couple other times in the past, I find I can appreciate this more. Wisdom and aging gave me more love for this movie. \n\n\nAt the very beginning they cut out the usual opening credits and just showed the title and did an aerial shot of the Scottish Highlands. It was a wonderful and an ingenious move. The movie isn't about the director or the actors (which turns out the leading man IS the director...I digress...), it's about William Wallace. The man. The legend. It's also about the Scottish trying to win their freedom from the tyrannous hands of Longshanks and past English rulers. \n\n\nWithout the wonderful actors, writers, and the film crew this movie would have been cheesy and a waste of my time. They blended the romance, warfare, humor, action, drama, and historical facts very well. The balance between all the genres was well done and I bow to writers and director. I find in a lot of these movies, the writers and whatnot try to play on the safe-side I only have a couple of genres at play. However, it takes a great movie maker to blend such a wonderful movie with many different genres and themes. \n\n\nI also must give a bow to the costume designers. In many films about medieval times the costumes seem to be a little cheesy and not historical accurate. If you were a commoner, you didn't get the luxury of having nice clothes. You wore clothes until they were pretty much rags. The costume designers, in this film, made me feel like I was watching a documentary secretly filmed! Again....wonderfully done.\n\nThere are so many things worth mentioning, but I mostly loved the story. I know there are a lot of historical flubs and errors, buuuuuut I love this movie. I love it as a movie freak, a history buff, a romance-enthusiast, and mostly because it's makes me extremely proud of my Scottish blood. \n\nAlright...there are a couple things I'm not a fan off. I wasn't too keen on Murron's and William's fast-paced relationship. Yes, yes, I know it was love at first sight, but c'mon! They only courted for a couple of days and then married? Really? I felt like they really rushed their courtship into a couple days. Yes, I know they had to make time for the blood and the \"freedom\" scenes, but I feel like they should have gave the illusion of a decent love affair between William and Murron. I also wasn't a fan with the ending. Yes...it is the most epic of endings, but I hated it because I have a hard time watching it. It's so hard for me to watch the last ten minutes or so... Don't get me wrong! It's a great way to end the movie! *SPOILER ALERT* I especially love how the had Murron drifting in the crowd and waiting for ax to end William's life and so they can be joined forever and eve. It was lovely and wonderfully done. I just really hated the torture parts. I'm usually good at observing scenes like these, but I have a hard time with this one. I can't explain it *SPOILER END* \n\nAll-in-all this is a wonderful film and I love it even more than when I first watched it! Not only were the costumes, aerial shots, visual effects, acting, and directing were amazing. But the story itself was inspiring and wonderful. I would recommend this to those who love a good story and war movies (it's not for the weak of belly). I will warn though: for historical nazis, this is not the film for you. Hollywood took some liberties with the true story of William Wallace and polished it up. It happens and I accepted that a long time ago. I must grant this one 5 stars; in all reality it would be 4.6 stars, but I don't give decimals. ^.^\n\nFavorite Character(s): Hamish, Morrison (he's just a hottie, I can't help myself), William Wallace (obvious one!), Princess Isabelle, and so many others.\n\nNot-so Favorite Character(s): Longshanks (evil, evil man! Not even the English liked this cold-hearted son of bit...biscut!), the majority of the Scottish nobles (didn't deserve to have their titles), and the creepy old soldier guy (who says \"you remind me of my daughter\" and then try to rape them? He was a big creepier and a little bonkers in the head)",

The story is about a young Scot named William Wallace who witnesses his father and brother being killed by the English soldiers so therefore, he is taken into custody by his uncle and trained to fight. When he returns twenty years later back to his village as a man played by the director himself Mel Gibson educated both in the classics and in the arts of war, he finds his childhood sweetheart Murron and the two quickly fall in love and secretly get married. As the English soldiers arrive and destroy parts of the village, William wishes to live in peace but as Murron dies in the attack, he quickly springs into action and leads his villagers as his Scottish army with his childhood partner Hamish to invade England and their army into the battlefields into a series of bloody battles. But along the way, William has a hushed affair with the Princess of Wales before his tragic beheading. The historical storyline of Scottish patriot William Wallace may be slightly all over the place but most of the time, it's definitely accurate, provides enough sweeping action, drama and some romance and a beautiful score by James Horner clearly shown from the bagpipes in the background soundtrack. This movie is a truly patriotic film to the UK residents including me as a UK person myself. Braveheart gets a true 10/10.",

But, strangely enough, in his second directing a popular actor in the world is more convincing not only as an artist as a real historical character - Scotsman William Wallace (1267-1305), who fought for the independence of their country against the English King Edward I. And it should be noted that two curious coincidence: Gibson played Wallace just at the age of 38 years (Scottish rebel died thirty-eight), and debutant screenwriter Randall Wallace is a family member (perhaps a distant descendant) of the national hero of Scotland.\n\nMel Gibson, who has created a lot of on-screen brave characters who risk everything to achieve their own goals, ventured on a grand scale and with a brave heart, even as one of the producers (along with Bruce Davey and Alan Ladd Jr.) costly historical tapes, whose budget was $ 72 million, while in rolling out in May 1995, she was at a disadvantage, because a few weeks earlier there was a similar picture in theaters - \"Rob Roy\" by Michael Caton-Jones, also of Scots opposed to the dictates of the English. But Gibson's film was twice more successful commercially in the U.S. and Canada ($ 75.6 million box office), in addition, $ 127 million was in other countries, that is, in the end justify the high cost of production.\n\nIn artistic terms both of these bands, in principle, comparable, but in some episodes of \"Braveheart\" seems preferable to \"Rob Roy.\" First of all - the powerful realistic and sometimes naturalistic recreated battles at the turn of the XIII-XIV centuries (the scene of the first battle of Stirling was shot on location, within six weeks, and the film was spent more than 90 hours of projection), and another by the majestic mood of the medieval saga of the brave and noble rebels. Although the picture of Mel Gibson may have lost because of their impact in the second half of a long, nearly three-hour narrative. But it is interesting that the audience rating in imdb she has a very high score of 8.3 (out of 10) with a very large number of voters (more than 175,000).",

            "content": "As rare as it comes, famous actor \"Mel Gibson\" directs a sweeping historical epic that defines Hollywood's true potential for producing ambitious spectacles. Braveheart showcases a bio-pic of the medieval Scottish Patriot, \"William Wallace\" in his quest to lead his nation in a rebellion against their English oppressors. It's strong points lie within some amazingly filmed battle sequences that are both violent and excessively brutal when it comes to gore, and in addition, a well-managed script featuring memorable pieces of dialogue, assist in advancing the plot further in a display of some very powerful segments of drama and romance. The Characters too are the backbone of the film, portrayed by a like-able cast, equally dedicated to their roles and give spellbinding performances, most especially from Gibson's depiction of William Wallace, who beholds a very suave Scottish Accent. \r\n\r\nEven with it's mastery on so many different scales of film-making, it is noticeably lacking in small areas that directs it away from the perfection it tries to achieve. In the midst of all the action that takes place, at times it forgets about certain components of the story. For instance, the relationships between characters are well-established in the beginning of the film, however as the plot progresses, the chemistry between these characters never develop, and the script abandons them as bland individuals who are simply wandering among the principal character, while the story revolves around them, greatly overshadowed by all the action. A romance between two characters, both loyal to different sides of a war, has a chemistry that lies nearly as a mystery, and occurs to the audience as a non-believable relationship. More importantly, the film lacks a human touch, also forgetting to explore the characters more in depth, and defining their motives as well as their attachment to the plot, and for some, the emotions meant to be felt by characters embedded in the film, go unnoticed. \r\n\r\nEven with the minor flaws, the quality placed into the making of this film is simply astounding, and whatever mistake there may be can easily be forgiven. Braveheart is a beautiful piece of cinema, filled with plenty of eye-candy, action and iconic moments that justify for it's atrocious running time, and makes it a must see for movie-lovers far and wide.",

It was because it had an inaccurate story but that doesn't take away the fact and I love this movie so much. Some of the users love this movie especially the praise it had when it first came out.\n\nYes, people. I think that this is by no means a masterpiece and I think it deserves more positive reviews on this website. The retelling of the legend of Wallace that I've never heard before is unique and groundbreaking and the depiction of the battle between Scotland and England was visualized perfect and one of the greatest action sequences ever put to film. Some of the action is bloody and violent and that's not a bad thing when it comes to bloody battles in most films.\n\nThe cinematography is very magnificent and the visuals and scenery of both Scotland and England are amazing and beautiful to look at. The cast, on the whole, is excellent and did great with their roles. James Cosmo, Brian Cox and Sophie Marceau did great with their roles as did Patrick MacGoohan as the ruthless King Edward of England, but Mel Gibson steals the show for doing a heroic job as William Wallace and his speech was not only emotional, but very inspirational.\n\nThe strongest aspect goes to the sweeping music score from James Horner and his music here is one of his best ones ever made. It combines some dramatic tones with some endearing sad and haunting tones to them, but it also has an emotional weight to it and would turn your eyes into faucets.\n\nOverall, Braveheart is a visually epic film with Mel Gibson at his finest and has done some other good films before this. I should think that this would always be watched for all time as one of the greatest movies ever made since The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Thumbs up from me!",

            "content": "The historical inaccuracies in this movie have been well documented in the past. Very little is known of the background to William Wallace, and what we do know comes mainly from an oral history originating after his death. Even what we do know is not translated accurately into the film. Perhaps the most glaring example of this is the Battle of Stirling Bridge, which is portrayed here without the bridge. This is seen as critical by historians since the bridge played a role in the Scottish victory. \r\nHowever, as screenwriter Randall Wallace (who had never heard of his famous ancestor until a fateful trip to Scotland) said in a HISTORY channel documentary on the movie, the script holds true to the spirit of the Wallace history and technical issues finally proved prohibitive to filming the battle as it happened. \r\nThe movie follows the story of William Wallace who led his native Scots in a revolt against the English King Edward the Longshanks (played with wonderful villainous relish by Patrick McGoohan). In an effort to \"breed\" out the Scots, Edward re-instigates an old practice whereby the English Lord blesses a marriage by taking the newly wed bride into his bed on the wedding night. \r\nNot willing to accept this Wallace and his bride (played by the impossibly beautiful Catherine McCormack) wed in secret. Then shortly after Wallace feels compelled to protect her from the lecherous advances of one of the Kings men, an action which leads to his bride being murdered by the English. \r\nThe reaction by Wallace is swift and brutal, and the Scots march down into England to wreak revenge on their occupiers. Some of the violence is very graphic with heads getting lobbed off and severed arms spurting blood, but the graphic depiction of violence is necessary given that battles in that time were usually fought in close proximity and were violent. \r\nIt's a story that I, as a native Scot, feel close to my heart and one that no doubt left an impact on the voters of Scotland who finally voted in the 1990s to partially secede from the United Kingdom to the extent that they now have their own parliament and are in control of most of their domestic policy. \r\nPerhaps surprising given his stature as one of Hollywood's leading men, Gibson handles his directorial duties expertly and in fact was recognized by the Academy in 1996 with a Best Director Oscar. He manages to weave together all the elements in what was a gigantic undertaking and gets fantastic performances from all involved.",

It clocks in at basically three hours, so set aside a large time frame if you plan on seeing it. As such, the movie can become tedious at parts. As I said, short list. Oh, and for those who don't like violence, stay away. If you enjoy violence, you're in for a treat.\n\nThe movie has a lot of things going for it. The soundtrack is top-notch (but I love Scottish music), and the cinematography often claims the same title. The acting is good all around, with Mel Gibson taking special claims with an amazing performance as William Wallace. The characters themselves span from mediocre to amazing, and the amazing ones tend to elicit a lot of emotion (and while we're on characters, Robert the Bruce is hands-down the best morally conflicted character I've ever seen in a movie). The plot, although remarkably predictable at times, is pretty good overall.\n\nReally, Braveheart is a pure epic, and everything comes together to create a movie that is simply POWERFUL. Between the emotional characters, great music and cinematography, and everything else, you're almost guaranteed to find yourself emotionally invested in this movie. That's something not a lot of other movies can claim. If you can find the time and can stand long movies, make sure to watch this movie.",

William Wallace (Mel Gibson) wants to fight the English in Scotland, ever since he was a little boy, and especially when his wife is killed. He collects of group of rugged individuals on doing so. I suppose that is essentially the film. The battle scenes and situations start out compelling and entertaining but the quality of the movie declines when just because it overindulges in such battles.  Lots of graphic scenes of violence, with tons of battles and excessive bloodshed. Gibson loves his blood splattering and exploding body parts, but it just goes out of control (thankfully not as much as his later film in 2000 called \"The Patriot\"). Some scenes are also idiotic, which includes one that consists of the Scottish mooning their enemies. The movie is not a total write-off, but it does contain some nice cinematography and set pieces, and some sequences are somewhat entertaining. Still, it is not a great movie, at least for me. Interestingly, I not basing my review on the historically inaccuracies, although I doubt they mooned their enemies to initiate a battle.",

Why is the Princess of Wales carrying Wallace's kid? And quite a few more....\nThat aside what you get is a motivational and quite graphic in its brutality film. Mel's Wallace (with his blue eyes and perfect mane of hair compared to the disheveled look of the rest of the cast) is believable as the Scottish patriot.\nThe rest of the cast is in fine form. The late Patrick McGooghan is a fantastic King Edward the 1st. \nThe true star here though is the Scottish Highlands. With its misty valleys, green mountains and weather that just makes you want the rest of the earth to look the same, it is one of the most perfectly shot films to cover that region.\nAll in all, a fantastic bit of fiction based on real events.

This is Braveheart.\r\n\r\nIt has been called a 'historical drama film' but apparently there's very little that is historical about it. Loosely based on Scottish hero William Wallace, a little on Robert the Bruce, Prince Edward and King Edward I.\r\n\r\nIt all begins at the beginning, funnily enough. With a small William Wallace and the death of his beloved dadda. Fast forward a few years and a lot of hair and there we have big William (Gibson) who has returned from his uncle's estate to woo the girl of his dreams, Murron (Catherine McCormack).\r\n\r\nThe drama erupts when some soldiers try to take advantage of William's new wife and he fights back with devastating consequences... and a lot of blood. War is declared on England by the 'savages' of Scotland led by our William. This brings all the clans together, but all is not perfect on the Scottish side. There are factions, betrayals, ignorance and confusion.\r\n\r\nAnd then there was England with King Edward I marrying his son the second to the french princess, Isabelle (Marceau). The prince, obviously batting for the other team, so to speak, rolls his eyes and does what his father commands. Eddie I is frustrated with Eddie II and bats him around the ears a little, lashes him with harsh unfeeling words then kills his lover. It seems there's trouble on every side.\r\n\r\nThe Scots win a few battles with loads of yelling, blue paint and crudely made weapons. And the English start to panic. Time to pay off a few Scots, methinks. Anyhoo, more blood is shed, more heads cut off, more stabbing and marching sounds, clashing of swords and more and more mud. Then betrayal comes and Wallace is arrested.\r\n\r\nThe last scene is the most painful and the most poignant. I had to look away a few times. So much blood, pain and dirt! The End.\r\n\r\nThis is an epic film, there's no denying it. Gibson did an incredible job, seeing as this was only the 2nd film he'd ever directed (the first was The Man Without a Face). There are a few similarities between this and the later The Passion of the Christ, especially at the end where he sees Murron moving through the crowd.\r\n\r\nI think it would have been a better film if it was based on true events, if it had the details right but I will simply choose to view it as fiction. As such it was a brilliant film. A grand, epic story. A victorious story reflecting the ability for humans to overcome evil and injustice with passion and selflessness. Something our society is sorely missing these days.\r\n\r\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlf9ZLnrtiE&feature=related]\r\n\r\nBraveheart Trivia:\r\n\r\nBudget - $53,000,000\r\nGibson struggled to raise the money for this venture, so he starred, produced and directed it to save cash. Good move, Gibson, good move.\r\nTo save a bit more money, the extras in the battle scenes are actually Irish soldiers. They are the same extras in the Scottish and English sides. And some scenes had to be reshot because these unprofessional extras were seen with watches and sunglasses on...\r\nPoor old Gibson was criticised by historians and animal activists. The latter were convinced he used real horses until they saw the raw footage.\r\nThe Battle of Stirling Bridge really took place around a bridge, not on an open plain.\r\nGibson stayed with members of the Wallace clan to learn more about their history.\r\nMechanical horses were used in the battle scenes, propelled by nitrogen cylinders on tracks\r\nThe Irish actually fought against the Scots on the English side... just sayin'.\r\nRobert the Bruce was known as 'Braveheart', not William Wallace",

Mel Gibson is a solid director and he did an amazing job his first time behind the camera. Gibson captured the raw beauty of Scottish countrysides better than anyone could imagine. The fight sequences were amazingly well done as well. The musical score still echos in my head every time I even catch a glimpse of this wonderful film.

Case in point: toward the end of the  film, when Wallace opens his eyes and shouts \"Freedom!,\" that is quickly followed by shots of eyes opening and closing. You don't realize that the music swells, that the cameras roll at high-speed, that the edits are timed just right, or that all these were carefully planned and laid out in the screenplay--you only experience the scene, a cinematic moment if ever there was one.",

But at this point of time stating that Braveheart is historically inaccurate is like stating that grass is green - it's obvious to anyone who has taken interest in this movie.\nWith that being said, do we do justice to this movie by bashing it's historical inaccuracy? I mean, Schindler's List also takes historical facts loosely for that matter. And you don't walk in to Hamlet and ask about how historically accurate it is. To be fair, we must mainly look at Braveheart's characters, story and message that it's trying to get across.\nSo, when we come to subject matter that actually matters, we ecounter 3 problems: the main hero is incredibly unrealistic and over-the-top good, the story can get silly at some times and the message can seem pretty naive if you are in cynical mind set.\nIn order to keep this as short as possible, I will avoid going into tiny details, with the exception of naming example for my \"story can get silly\" argument. So, here it is - in the movie, at the point when Wallace is talking to the princess for the very first time, when Mel delivers line \"...they killed her [dramatic pause] to get to me.\" Sophie's face just cracks me up every time. I know, that this is supposed to be dramatic, but instead it's just one big Michael Bay moment.\nAfter all of this, you may think that I hate this movie. But, it's actually quite the opposite - Braveheart is my favorite movie of all time. I mean, it's flawed, yes, but it's also very entertaining. And if you can suspend your cynicism, you can really dream along about romantic values such as heroism and uncompromised fight for justice.",

But still, I couldn't resist the temptation to actually make-believe it really happened. Such was the power of this grand epic, which I consider to be one of the most powerful filmic onslaughts on imperialism anywhere, bar perhaps Gandhi. True, liberties greatly exceeding the inclusion of the word \"Freedom!\" were taken in the depiction of Wallace's life, but still for all, I thought, who cares? This is an immensely powerful classic, and I'm sure it will sear over the passing of time, as a film which delves over a topic relevant for our time as it was for Wallace's - imperialism. In the end, that was what the story was all about: the triumph of the individual over stultifying bondage. It's a message that should be digested by all who watch this.",

            "content": "At the sixty-eighth annual academy awards, Mel Gibson's Braveheart won five awards, including best film, and it deserved every one of them. With epic battle sequences, rousing speeches, remarkable performances by some of Hollywood's best actors, and its inspiring tale of man's quest to liberate his homeland from tyranny, Braveheart is as great a film as has ever been made.\r\n\tFollowing the (mostly) true story of Scottish outlaw, hero, and martyr William Wallace, the film takes us from the childhood events that would shape him, through his war against the English, and to his betrayal and execution at the hands of Edward II. In any hands this would be an exciting tale, filled with violence, treachery, and intrigue. And in Gibson's hands, with a script based on the writings of the 15th century poet Blind Harry, this is truly a tale to inspire. It is inspiring because it is the story of a man who wanted only to live and work in peace, but who was willing to take up arms to avenge the woman he loved.\t\r\nIt is inspiring because no matter how high the odds were stacked against him, and no matter what he was offered in return for halting his crusade, he would not give up his struggle to free his beloved Scotland.  And it is inspiring because unlike other men, who would have sought to use their military success towards their own rank and status, Wallace fought under the banner of another, Robert the Bruce, even when Robert did not deserve it. For Wallace it was not about power, or wealth, or even his own honor, though this mattered to him greatly. It was about seeing Scotland free and independent under the man who rightfully held claim to the throne.\r\nWilliam Wallace, as depicted here, is one of the greatest heroes in any film, and only Mel Gibson could have done the role justice. Despite the scandals and alcoholism that have plagued him in recent years, there can be little doubt that Gibson was, and is, a great actor. And when this film was made, he was at the very height of his career and acting ability. Earnest and charismatic he brings both the gravity and experience of a veteran actor and the energy and enthusiasm of a younger man. Few actors will ever give a performance as great as the one he gave here, and it was unquestionably the best of his career.\r\nThe other cast members also performed excellently. Patrick McGoohan is the very epitome of ruthlessness as Edward the Longshanks. Sophie Marceau likewise performs very well as the noble princess Isabella, whose romance with Wallace, although wildly historically inaccurate does much to give the film an extra emotional pull. Angus Mcfayden is particularly compelling as Robert the Bruce. He is a good man who genuinely wants to do the right thing, but who lacks self confidence and is plagued by evil council. It is with great anticipation that we await the moment he will break free from his fears and doubts and take up the cause.\r\nFrom a technical and cinematic standpoint, Braveheart is exceptionally well made. No expense has been spared on the sets and costumes, and the film utilizes some of the most beautiful settings in Scotland and Ireland. And the battle scenes are among the greatest ever to be put on film. The scale of the battles is something to behold, with hundreds of fully armed and costumed combatants on both sides.  Neither have the filmmakers shied away from the sheer brutality of medieval warfare. Watching the axes and claymores strike their mark, the hard part is believing that people weren't harmed. This violence alone, without the later execution scene, is enough to earn the film a hard R rating, but it is absolutely what's needed.\r\nIt may be graphic, it may be suspect in its historical accuracy, and I admit it has cast aside much of the complexity of the real William Wallace for the sake of a more compelling narrative. And of course it's a vanity production on the part of Gibson. But Braveheart is absolutely the kind of rousing epic that audiences crave. It is well acted, well crafted, and contains a compelling story and an uplifting message at its heart. Wallace's cry of \"Freedom!\" will resound with you long after the film has ended. There is no doubt in my mind that this was the best film of 1995, and it has lost none of its impact since.",

Mel Gibson's epic, committed direction accompanied by John Toll's gorgeous, sweeping cinematography make \"Braveheart\" one of the finest war films out there, and even if there are a few silly romantic subplots that have gotten cheesier with age, they don't make \"Braveheart\" any less of a spectacle.

Head being smashed, legs and arms being chopped off, stoamchs being slashed, this is the type of action Gibson likes and at least he doesn't try to sugarcoat anything. A lot of elements from this movie was obviously in another Best Picture winner \"Gladiator\" but \"Braveheart\" has purpose and what William Wallace and his crew are fighting for is something much greater, which gives this movie that edge and emotional impact.

            "content": "Amazing. The acting is just ridiculously good (particularly from Mel Gibson and Angus Macfadyen), and shockingly, no Oscar nominations for either. It takes place during the 13th century, in Scotland. The film follows a man named William Wallace (GIbson) who is affected by the growing presence of English in Scotland, and their ridiculous law which allows them to basically marry whoever they want. This includes Scottish women. When one of the perverted, old English soldiers makes a move on Wallace's woman, all hell breaks loose starting a war between Wallace and the King of England (aka Longshanks). Shot on location in Scotland, the land is beautiful with gorgeous mountains and lakes. The land is also very bleak, with the sky being cloudy throughout the film. A setting not often seen in a movie. The battles are incredibly bloody and gory, and brutally realistic. During one of the battles, (there are two large scale ones) a Scottish soldier smashes an English soldier's head with a gigantic sledgehammer and his brains/blood fly onto the camera. The film is masterfully made. After hearing about the famous \"freedom\" speech that Wallace delivers to his men, it really did live up to the word. It was incredibly uplifting and emotional, as well as the word(s) he used at the end. At first Mel Gibson seemed a bit of an odd choice for the lead role, appearing to be an old, alcoholic child- molestor type of guy, but I soon developed a tolerance for his act and forgot about that image once he made the freedom speech. The best acting comes from Angus Macfadyen as Robert the Bruce with his emotional and quick shouting of powerful words striking me in the heart. Overall, this is a masterfully made movie about respecting your rights, your freedom, your country, and your honor.",

It's very rare you come across a movie made that's based on a true story or legend where most all of it is accurate. Stretching the boundaries and thinking \"what if this happened?\" is what makes a great movie. I enjoyed this Scottish legend retold; and overall, everything including the acting and the effects of the battles were great.",

It has gruesome battle scenes that just says WOW and all of it is true which makes it interesting. This film definitely deserved Best Picture infact I would be pist if it didn't. Gibson has what it takes to make a true action/adventure movie that action fans really need to see.\r\n \r\nAs I said before the movie not only has bloody battle scenes, but an inspiring true story that will shock the audience. The story is based off of Sir William Wallace, a Scottish knight from the 13th century who lead the resistance against the King of England. The reason of why the resistance started was because William had enough of the English after they killed his mother, father, and the one that lit the spark his wife. Then he gathers up an army other scotsmen who were also fed up with the English ruling over and prepare for a war that will be talked about through out the years.\r\n \r\nAll of the characters that are portrayed in this film are true and the main ones being Sir William Wallace and Edward I Longshanks whom wanted to contol Scottish. I gotta say if they were right about Edward I Longshanks then he was a real asshole because he betrays alot of his own men in the movie and has no respect for anyone except himself, but in the end people like him are nothing but cowards. As the movie progresses Willam grows more bolder and braver to fight against the English despite that fact that he and his army are out numbered. But that is what is needed in all of the good characters in action movies is heroism which the Scottish have.\r\n \r\nI would say that the film portrays two themes and that is never give up even when the odds are against you and standing up for your rights. Never giving up is pretty much seen through out the whole movie infact its what makes it. The fact that the English had more men than the Scots did really shows what people would go through to gain freedom even if it means death. Also in a way they stood up for their rights beacuse they had the right to live in their own country in peace and the English had no right to be there in first place let alone a hundred years of rape and murder.\r\n \r\nOverall the movie is emotionally powerful, very depressing at parts, and a well deserved oscar winning movie.",
