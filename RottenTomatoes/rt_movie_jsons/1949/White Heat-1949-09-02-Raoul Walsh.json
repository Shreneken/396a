            "content": "James Cagney is all riled up and ready to shoot!\n\nRaoul Walsh's film noir White Heat (1949) is as classic and entertaining as crime drama gets. James Cagney gets to shoot men down left and right with a manly gusto. His manic robber mastermind Cody Jarrett is both fearsome and funny as his delirium gets worse. Walsh's dark and moody direction also features piercing Sunlight and shocking shootouts. Walsh does not shy away from any of the brutal violence and painful pasts of the men on the run, desperate enough to murder for money. Virginia Kellogg's film noir story for White Heat is well written with a complexly layered crime drama narrative of betrayal and hysteria. Her themes of loyalty tie in nicely with a hail of bullets. White Heat is fast, confident, and highly entertaining.\n\nVirginia Mayo is lovely and delightful as the sinister and selfish femme fatale Verna Jarrett, who will nonchalantly betray her husband at a moment's notice. Edmon O'Brien is excellent as the stalwart cop Fallon, who goes undercover as Vic Pardo to unmask Cody Jarrett's fence for stolen goods. His stern and cautious nature are fun foil attributes to James Cagney's wildly erratic behavior. Cagney is as charming, earnest, and funny as he is dangerous in White Heat. I must mention the searing performance from Margaret Wycherly as the protective and tough old robber Ma Jarrett. You can see where Cody picked up his crook lifestyle from her and her vicious, cynical nature. The entire ensemble cast is effective and lets Cagney go mad for our enjoyment.\n\nEditor Owen Marks blasts through White Heat's story with sharp and fast paced cuts for a very brisk 114 minutes that feels half the length. Sidney Hicox' iconic black and white cinematography frames faces in shadowy darkness like the copper's setting up men for a police line-up. His wide shots show car chases, shootouts, robberies, and heist planning sequences with the same grace, elegance, and darkness as a brutal murder scene. Max Steiner's score is brimming with life and gentle melodies, while powering through fast rhythms for the action. Leah Rhodes' costumes for the criminals are gritty, while her gowns and dresses for Virginia Mayo are gorgeous and still chic.\n\nIn all, White Heat holds up to modern gunfire with its fast pace and stellar acting that enthralls you, especially James Cagney's pleasantly sentimental and ferociously on edge performance.",

            "content": "I've got no trouble admitting that my tastes are pretty conventional when it comes to film. If popular opinion is particularly strong on a performance or production, it usually matches up with my own opinion, more or less; but that makes the relatively few disagreements that I have on certain aspects of the industry stand out a bit. To that end, I'm not convinced that White Heat is the unparalleled masterpiece that so many seem to claim it is. Cagney is the undeniable focal point of the film, enticingly off-kilter, violent, and unpredictable, but far too often the plot doesn't actually focus on him, instead trying to entice the audience with scenes dedicated to the far less compelling police force trying to corral him, including painfully slow explanations of 1940s tracking technology and the like. The film seems convinced that its viewers are there to give their support to the morally righteous officers of the law, but that's a miscalculation; they're there for Cagney, whether to wallow in his insanity and the tension it creates, or even to root for him as an antihero. When the film allows him the screen, the lead eats it up with great presence and a heaping helping of lovely tropey dialogue; his character has some complexity to it with its balance of gratuitous violence and emotional dependence that adds a lot for Cagney to chew on, so much so that the shortcomings in the rest of the film are all the more evident. The film is still good, don't get me wrong, but it's difficult to rectify what's actually on the screen with the film's hefty reputation. (3.5/5)",

It's very smart, and Director Raoul Walsh keeps us on our toes without wasting a single moment in telling this story.  Most of all, it has James Cagney, who is just fantastic.  The film is both dark both in how it's shot, a classic film noir, and in its tone, as Cagney's character is sociopathic, wracked by migraines, and possibly insane.  He is supported by a great cast, including Margaret Wycherly in the memorable role as his mother, whose toughness and depravity is gradually revealed.  Edmond O'Brien is also strong in the role of the undercover G-man. \n\nOne theme in the film is how easily (and violently) criminals will betray one another.  Another is how advanced forensic and crime-fighting technology was in 1949, which is both impressive and may make you smile.  The two of those put together serve as a strong anti-crime message, likely influenced by the production code, and yet, the film is gritty and pushes boundaries, so that it doesn't feel like a morality tale.  Character motivations feel authentic.  There are several iconic moments, the ending of course, but also Cagney returning and surprising his wife (Virginia Mayo) in the garage, and later staring at a rival (Steve Cochran) through the crack of a door.  He is absolutely chilling when angry, and one can't help but be impressed by the great range he showed over his career.  If you're in the mood for action and a dark crime film, 'White Heat' is very satisfying.",

            "content": "White Heat is a film noir about a group of thieves who rob a train, but end up killing some people during the heist so they have to go into hiding. I like heist movies but these aren\u0092t complex or interesting robberies, they simply hold up people. And from the very beginning James Cagney is set up as brutal, heartless, and a little psychotic. He probably should not have been the main character of this movie, because he's entirely unsympathetic.\n\nThe hero of the film, and the one I wish the whole movie focused on, was played by Edmond O\u0092Brien. He comes in as an undercover police officer, and his struggle to earn Cagney\u0092s trust and avoid being suspected is the most compelling part of White Heat. Sadly, the movie kept almost all the attention on Cagney to the point that I kept losing track of which guy was O\u0092Brien. Late in the movie his role becomes a bit more active and that's when I was most locked into the story. \n\nI have this messed up issue with liking movies about criminals, but only when they are fun or likable people. In White Heat they aren't pleasant. The crooks are vicious, and they even backstab one another regularly. So I never cared about them, I just wanted them to get caught. I think they tried to make us feel for Cagney with the mother issues and his mental breaks, but it didn't click for me. There wasn't anything in White Heat that actively annoyed me, but it was fairly lackluster. I couldn't stop thinking that they had the potential to do something better.",

There is so much of him in Stephen Graham (in the role of Capone) from Boardwalk Empire. Also: what a great cast working together! Edmond O'Brien does an incredible job.",

            "content": "Orson Welles isn't one of my favorite directors, but I agree with what he said of James Cagney: \"Maybe the greatest actor to ever appear in front of a camera.\" \"White Heat\" is only my second film of his, and even before I had seen \"Angels with Dirty Faces,\" I was convinced in my heart he would become one of my favorite actors of all time, let's say I predicted it. Pound for pound, Cagney may be the the greatest actor ever, at least that's how I felt while watching him. He was short in stature, and if you look at his body from the neck below it's not intimidating; all he needs is his face and voice that delivers lightening-quick dialogues. My favorite sequence is actually a tender one, where he talks of his loneliness and his family background. This is the ultimate badass. I'm not even that interested in talking about the film, which is one of the best noirs (although doesn't surpass \"Double Indemnity\" or \"The Maltese Falcon\");  briefly, it concerns a undercover cop who joins Cody Jarrett (Cagney)'s gang in prison. Guys like De Niro, Pacino, Brando, Nicholson, or Mifune had more resources and better directors to work with, they were in better films, thus having more versatile characters. I think if Cagney had gotten a opportunity to portray in more realistic films he would be even more extraordinary. In my mind, at the moment I feel he is certainly better than 50s' Brando. Sure, his characters are more limited, but the energy and power he brings is unmatched. Only in one scene did I feel he wasn't as good as he is throughout the rest of the movie. Forget the two \"Scarface\" movies, watch \"White Heat.\" \n\nMade it, Ma! Top of the world!",

Margaret Wycherly  plays Ma and is as amoral as any killer of the genre.  This plot line dominates the first half of the film and includes many memorable scenes. We are shown Cody sitting on Ma's lap while being given whiskey to ameliorate his chronic headache.  She gives him the toast, \"Top of the world.\" Later, Ma visits Cody in jail and vows to kill Big Ed, a member of his gang who tried to have Cody killed, herself.  Finally, when Cody learns that Ma was murdered, he goes berserk in the prison mess and is eventually diagnosed with as psychotic.\n\nAfter breaking out of prison with the undercover federal agent  played by Edmund O'Brien,  we are shown numerous acts of violence and cruelty. When reunited with his wife, he knocks her off a chair while showing him her new fur.  This scene was probably more shocking at the time than that in which Cagney smashes a grapefruit in Jean Harlow's face in The Public Enemy.  He also has a number of callous one-liners, none more heartless than the one which follows his silencing of a stool pigeon's muffled cries as he riddles the trunk of a car with bullets,  \"Oh, stuffy, huh? I'll give you a little air.\"\n\nThe final scene, in which Jarrett climbs to the top of a gas storage tank after being cornered by the police, is classic Cagney.  Jarrett starts firing at the tank and shouts, \"Made it, Ma! Top of the world!\" The tank and several adjoining ones explode, killing Jarrett before the police's gunshots can.",

WHITE HEAT succeeds in creating a particular uneasiness within the viewer who's watching this flick. I mean, it's not often you see innocent people getting murdered in a classic film. Nor is it often when an actor can convince an audience that maybe the bad guy is not as bad as he makes himself out to be. Cagney plays the character as a man with a mother complex, who has inherited the families nuttiness.
