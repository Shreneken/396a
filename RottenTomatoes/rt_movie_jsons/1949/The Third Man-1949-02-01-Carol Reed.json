    "summary": "Set in postwar Vienna, Austria, \"The Third Man\" stars Joseph Cotten as Holly Martins, a writer of pulp Westerns, who arrives penniless as a guest of his childhood chum Harry Lime (Orson Welles), only to find him dead. Martins develops a conspiracy theory after learning of a \"third man\" present at the time of Harry's death, running into interference from British officer Maj. Calloway (Trevor Howard) and falling head-over-heels for Harry's grief-stricken lover, Anna (Alida Valli).",

I don't know if it's right to call it flawless, but there wasn't a moment where I was wondering why the scene was happening or that an element didn't fit. The zither was goofy, but it added great atmosphere to some of the sequences. \n\nThis is undisputably worthy of of being known as a classic. It's just too bad my VHS tape has some sound quality issues late in the film.",

The music took me a while to get used too as its very jarring at first and feels very out of place but then it tones down and really works in a very distinct way that's hard to describe. The pacing is very good also, again it can be a bit on the dry side with a lot of exposition throughout but it never feels wasted or repetitive which is quite remarkable. Things ramp up in the middle and slowly builds to a great ending. The editing is excellent overall as well. The standout is the incredible cinematography which is some of the best I've ever seen with a complete Tour De France of styles, mood and atmosphere. The ending chase is one of the best chases I've ever seen mainly because of the cinematography and how strong it is. It makes it worth sitting through the hour plus to get to it. An All Time Classic.",

            "content": "I won't bury the lede: this is one of the best movies ever made, and one of my favorite films. This is simple story telling done 10/10 at every level of production.\n\nCarol Reed's masterpiece is a stunning noir that bathes the screen in chiaroscuro  with canted angles used to perfection. The story is a simple, yet compelling mystery--with a great inversion on the femme fatale trope that has, in my opinion, has helped kept the story timeless. Memorably, this film produces what has to be the greatest cinematic character introduction of all time, coupled with the uniquely perfect zither-led score that still produces goosebumps even when played back in my mind's eye.\n\nJoseph Cotten seems born to play Holly Martins. Alida Valli's performance is an ahead of its time portrayal of the Femme Fatale; told against a believable foundation of what would now be recognized as psychological trauma and a likely mentally abusive relationship with Orson Welles's Harry Lyme. \n\nThe supporting cast fills every moment with intrigue, humor and mystery, driving the story forward. The Mid-Atlantic dialogue takes a break from its stilted position in the noir genre, thanks to the European setting of the film--and it offers color to the film's audial experience that contrasts nicely with the genre's famous black-and-white. \n\nThis is not to suggest the black-and-white film is boring or monotonous. The lighting, camera work, and attention to detail make Vienna feel like a living creature in its own right. The visual texture and tactile feel achieved in this film is for my money, unmatched in the history of cinema--save for perhaps Ridley Scott's \"Blade Runner.\" The editing that accompanies the cinematography uses the chiaroscuro and Dutch angles to heighten the film's visual language, and economically uses what is a lean and mighty score. \n\nAnd of all the iconic things which come out of this film, the zither-led score may be the most iconic.  It is beautiful, odd, conversational, and constantly driving the story forward with its vibrant strumming and use of musical dynamics. Very few films' scores are better than this.\n\nIn conclusion, every aspect of this film is on song. The direction, the acting, the writing and editing are phenomenal. This low-budget project, which almost didn't get made, shows how the power of storytelling and genre can transcend constraints of the trade and the larger artform itself, and result in one of the best films ever made.",

My feeling is that \"The Third Man\" represents that most ultra-rare example of a film for which the term flawless doesn't go nearly far enough. It is exquisite in every sense; it is mysterious, captivating, stirring, complex, and bittersweet. Built atop a landscape of shocking desolation, the story bursts forth with the muted gaiety of its zither score, tilted shots immediately and beautifully intimating a world in which something is obviously askew. Into this world we are introduced to an interplay between characters that are as indelible as any in cinema, engaging within an atmospheric milieu that boasts the most evocative shots of cobblestones, dark alleyways, and perversely elongated shadows that could ever be hoped for in the dusky annals of noir. Layers of complexity and barely concealed themes invest the story with a degree of depth that matches its accessibility, resulting in a stirring cinematic statement whose thrills are never the least bit dulled by the profundity. The film boasts the most memorable character entrance in cinema as well as an ending sequence whose emotional weight rivals the iconic final image of John Wayne in \"The Searchers.\" Like a monstrous shadow cast by an innocuous balloon bearing peasant, \"The Third Man\" delights in demonstrating to us that all is not as it seems.",

You never really need an excuse but Jahner's work beautifully illustrates the chaos of rubble clearance, blackmarketeering, Allied Zones and the need to plough on when war ends. The Third Man is the quintessence of that brought to celluloid. It's one  of the accepted great films and for good reason. Once you get through the omnipresent zitar, you're there in a bewildering world of transient individuals, competing proto-Cold War agendas in a state that has absolutely no sense of it's point, direction or place. Your perspective and sympathies constantly shift in a story that pushes onto a place where you sympathise with the eye rolling cynicism of the British General. Everyone's great but Wells brings that special bit of naughtiness, just when you think it's a great whodunnit. Vienna is never more beautifully shot than until Ultravox get their hands on it.

Its setting in war torn Austria not long after WW2 ended adds a layer of wondrous authenticity to the story, that you would not have got had it been done even a couple of decades later.\n\nVery tight story. Joseph Cotten is delightful as the world-weary writer trying to find out what happened to his best friend. Orson Welles enters the film and moves it from a great film to a stupendous film as he delivers a fabulous, casually psychopathic performance.\n\nHighly recommended.",

I enjoy how the film foregoes romanticism in order to present a bleak backdrop for a story that could easily have been butchered by other filmmakers desiring to give it levity and convention. A mention to Joseph Cotten too, who plays the protagonist well. Most of the charm for the film, I must say, comes from its expertly layered setting of postwar Vienna, and the unique zither score, more so than the good acting and plot.",

The word itself is an oxymoronic juxtaposition that, like post-WWII Vienna and like Carol Reed's masterpiece, places side-by-side apparently incongruent elements in a fashion that is greater than the sum of its parts. As Michael Wilmington has written, the film \"marks one of those unusual conjunctions of script, director, subject, cast and setting\u2014and, of course, music\u2014in which everything works.\" The often jarring discrepancies play off one another in suggestive ways: Giant shadows cast by tiny children, a zither score as jaunty as it is haunting in its strangeness, the corrupt cosmopolity sharing secrets and offices\u2014even the names of our hero and villain, Holly and Harry, are so similar that they consistently are confused for one another (just like the other case of misidentification at the heart of the narrative). Yet these contradictions are not held in binary opposition but speak to something beyond the simple framework of good versus evil that a lesser film would be content with; rather, like the great wheel the film's most famous sequence revolves around, the distinction between going up and going down depends entirely on where you're standing.",

These narrative attributes are thanks in no small part to master storyteller and novelist Graham Greene, who penned the film's screenplay. This is a project that takes great pride in its slow burn approach, offering up a veneer of normalcy to the viewer, but with little nuances in the dialogue, tonality and camerawork to let you know something's not quite right here. Once the reveals come, though, I'll say I had a consistently pervasive smile on my face. Any and every scene with Orson Welles is nothing short of iconic. That's not to take away from Joseph Cotten's commendable lead turn. It's just that, with the way the movie sets everything up involving Welles character, you really can't help but leave the screening remembering every scene involving him.

Upon completing that, on the following page was a short story titled The Third Man, and the famous movie I had never seen came to mind, never even realizing Greene was involved in that. Greene explains in a short editor's note preceding this story that this was never even meant for publication and was simply part of his method when contracted to develop a script. I will quote Greene now, \"To me it is almost impossible to write a film play without first writing a story. Even a film depends on more than plot, on a certain measure of characterization, on mood and atmosphere; and these seem to me almost impossible to capture for the first time in the dull shorthand of a script.\" Greene goes on to dedicate this story to director Carol Reed, \"in admiration and affection and in memory of so many early morning Vienna hours at Maxim's, the Casanova, the Oriental\", and when viewing these two quotes in the context of this film we can begin to see how Reed and Greene were able to achieve, along with the score, a certain feeling or ambiance amidst the streets of postwar Vienna that is really what many will remember most about this film. The roles were well cast and acted all around and while the story may not offer the opportunity to have our points of view challenged or change the way we think this film accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do, provide an engrossing mystery thriller that keeps the audience engaged until the conclusion. Before I started this film today I thought back and realized I didn't remember much at all about The Heart of the Matter but could still recall The Third Man fondly.\n\n*Usually refrain from placing ratings on films based on books I have previously read as it is nearly always unfair to the film.",

I first saw this when I was a teenager and perhaps too young to fully appreciate it, as I wasn't impressed that much back then; now, I can recognize how great the film is, the bristly intelligent, darkly comic script by Graham Greene, the brilliant filmmaking of director Carol Reed, the superlative performance by an ace cast, the haunting b&w cinematography of Robert Krasker and the taut editing of Oswald Hafenrichter; only the gratingly annoying, ever-constant zither music prevents it from being a perfect 10.",

            "content": "Aka a first time appraisal through 2019 eyes of a classic film that's 70 years old. In this fairly straight-forward and non-contrived noir thriller set contemporaneously to the time it was made, pulp fiction writer Holly Martins travels to Vienna to meet Harry Lime, an old friend only to find that he has died just before his arrival. Graham Greene's script, choke full of noir troupes and red herrings, is a simple and clever take of the genre that pulls its audience in deeper into mystery, just like its lead character. Playing with audience expectations to great effect, it feels ahead of its time. Meanwhile, Carol Reed's directing has equally stood the test of time rather well, as his monochrome work with cinematographer, Robert Krasker, is a visual joy. Shot mostly at night, on authentic location in post-WWII Vienna, the film is textually rich and their use of shadows and tilted and low angle shots perfectly complement the suspenseful mood of the film. However, the pacing of the film would be considered slow nowadays and Joseph Cotten's Martins, comes across as stiff and wooden, which allows Orson Welles's enigmatic Lime to steal the film from him with an incredibly charismatic and memorable performance that looms large over its 104mins duration even if he's absent on screen for most of that time. Of course, there is Anton Karas' famous zither music soundtrack which is now synonymous with the film. Intensely Austrian with a jolly, bouncy fun-fair ride feel to it, it may at times undercut the tension and frames the thriller in a more comedic light while presenting Harry Lime as a more cuddly villain (which he isn't), but it's now simply impossible to imagine the film without this utterly unique and inspired musical accompaniment.",

            "content": "Of all of the films from around this era that I have been told to watch because they are \"important\" this was certainly the best. Film noir is not generally a genre that I'm into, with the exception of Blade Runner (1982) and Mildred Pierce (1945), but this film managed to reel me in completely and I was never left wondering how much longer the film would be. The famous moment at which Orson Welles appears and everything beyond his arrival does completely overshadow the majority of the film but that works because we have already been warned that Harry Lime is a far more exciting presence than the nice but forgettable Holly Martins and casting no less than Orson Welles helps us to understand why Anna feels such an inextricable connection to him. This is a truly great film and it is more than just it's many iconic shots.\n\nHolly Martins, Joseph Cotten, is a well-meaning writer who travels to Vienna to meet his longtime friend Harry Lime, Orson Welles, but when he arrives he discovers that Lime is dead. Lime is warned by several shady figures who knew Lime to leave Vienna but Martins remains steadfast in his belief that Lime was an innocent man. He falls in love with Anna, Alida Valli, who was Lime's girlfriend but she is unable or unwilling to let go of the memory of Lime and begin a romantic relationship with Martins. Evidence begins appearing that suggests that Lime is not in fact dead but has faked his death to escape from the enemies he made when he was alive.\n\nThe film has what seems like a convoluted plot but the circumstances surrounding Lime's disappearance are not really the focus of the film, Martins' dogged pursuit of Anna despite the fact she does not reciprocate his affections in anyway is sad but we feel similar to her when we witness Welles' magnetic charisma, on display from just one shot of him smirking. Martins establishes himself as a good person at the beginning of the film and doesn't change even as those around him urge him to let go of Anna or to criticize his friend who has essentially betrayed him. This could be frustrating but Cotten makes Martins believably earnest and sweet enough for us to trust that his character is genuine in his loyalty to two fickle people.\n\nThe cinematography and direction is stunning with Robert Krasker's camera capturing the darker parts of Vienna, specifically the sewers, in moody black and white. The final action scene features particularly gorgeous shots of Lime's fingers holding on to a grate while the harsh wind blows above him and various men running angrily through a dirty sewer. The final shot of Martins waiting for Anna with hands in pockets as she walks past him without a second glance is morose and melancholy and reinforces what the whole film has been about. I read that the film's look was strongly inspired by German expressionism and I can see the Secrets of a Soul (1926) template that it's working from.\n\nThe final reason that you absolutely must watch this film is the one, the only Orson Welles. I had read so much about what a presence he has and what a great director he was, I don't like The Magnificent Ambersons (1942), and been highly disbelieving in much the same way I am about James Dean. After seeing this film I have become a complete convert as I felt a rush go through my body at just seeing his face on screen. His face, his voice, his expressions, his everything are exciting and watching him do almost anything on screen is invigorating. I couldn't imagine anyone else playing Lime and he was one of the few characters heralded as exciting throughout the film that lived up to or even exceeded my expectations. If you don't have time for The Stranger (1946) or Citizen Kane (1941) then this is an easy hour and 48 minutes to marvel at.\n\nThis deserves to be on those lists of 1001 movies you have to see before you die because it does feel essential when watching it. The story, the cinematography and the presence of Orson Welles make it a fantastic production.",

And even though this uncertain shady streets follows a typical cat and mouse chase, unfortunately there seems to be very little skin in the game on terms of narration. And despite of the fact that the storyline suggests the inseparable chemistry between the lead characters, there is very little romance among the antics. Plummeting downwards by an immense pressure of almost overstuffed material, Reed seems to be in some sort of hurry to catch up the next act. In order to do so, it achieves a ferocious pace but doesn't quite glorifies the thrills and stakes of the circumstances.\n\nThe makers could have easily milked out more cinema by savoring the concept and slowing down the procedure for a better effect. Nevertheless these minor complications can easily be leapt over by a gripping thriller that it maps out on screen. Welles as the ultimate flip of the act, has unfortunately a one dimension side of his to portray, and yet with spooky expressive performance, he sticks the landing. Cotten as the leader that we all follow, the victim, the protagonist, has fairly much wider room to factor in along with Valli's love angle.\n\nNo matter how thought provoking and absorbing Reed's world is, it certainly is too mechanical to bubble up as a free spirit. There are too many strings tied for it to be independent of the traffic which at times holds it back; the semantics is the double edged sword, both productive and consuming. The donated blood and sweat of Reed pays off for his meticulous execution that still holds up after decades. The Third Man is the pre-war inquisitive concept that is held by an equally opposite competitive action.",

            "content": "Just watched this for the first time. Didn't seem easy to get into at the start, a lot of dialogue in general, and a lot of German dialogue in particular, means I'd likely have to pay closer attention to it, and to expect the dissonance of not understanding what is being said, despite it seeming to be pivotal to the story!\n\nBut I persevered, gave up on following every sentence. Stop trying to understand, just feel. And this film just continues to deliver in every moment.\n\nThe cinematography is just breathtaking. Take a one still out of any part of this movie, and it would rank from excellent to world beating (to this day). The use of light and texture and depth is constantly surprising and delighting. Some parts just hit you with one perfect scene after another. As an amateur photographer, it just amazes me the attention to detail in every shot, throughout the whole film.\n\nOf course, nothing in life is perfect. The Dutch Angles sometimes feel a bit heavy handed to me and of course the lighting and feel are by now writ large in second rate copies and parody. But neither of these things take away from the flow and enjoyment.\n\nI loved the music. I like juxtaposition, and to me the music sets up it's own character in the film, giving it a light hearted feel even though the subject is quite dark. Someone could do a heavy modern classical score or an expansive synthesised ambient score and totally change the feel. Would actually be fun to experience! But the jaunty guitar tune works to tie the film together and adds a naive spice to things.\n\nThe dialogue is sharp as a tack. There are a few moments I just chuckled at the to-and-fro, some lovely moments just appear out of nowhere. And of course the acting rarely misses a beat. I felt an occasional brief stumble, but overall it is just impeccable, and the flow between scenes is fast and very slick.\n\nI will need to revisit this film many times again. Could be my new most favourite film.",

Director Carol Reed uses careful lighting to illuminate just enough of characters to see them in the dim rooms and dark streets of post WWII Vienna. Reed's wide shots of the city rubble and building doorways is exquisite direction. The highly decorated sets and rubble filled city ruins of Vienna are the perfect backdrop to this intriguing thriller. Around every corner is another twist and clue to solve the mystery.\n\nThe quirky music keeps reminding you to just have fun with The Third Man and go along for a very fun ride. The constant jokes and lighthearted jabs keep you entertained while you figure your way through this complex narrative of crime and punishment. The story starts with what feels like an ending, but drags you deeper into its shocking reveals. The Third Man's brisk 104 minutes of running time goes by like a breeze. I think most audiences will find something they like during The Third Man.\n\nJoseph Cotten is the real star here as you follow alongside his character, Holly Martins, stumbling through Vienna's complicated political divide between 4 nations and Austria. Cotten is such a compelling and likable actor that you just relate and focus in on his character naturally. This is a great and multi-faceted role for Cotton, and certainly one of his best.\n\nSupporting Cotten in The Third Man is Alida Valli as Anna. She is mysterious and sultry. You really sympathize with her character because of Valli's realistic portrayal of a woman in love. She is really believable in The Third Man.\n\nIn regards to Orson Welles, I will just say that whenever he is on screen, you are absolutely glued to the screen. His presence is constantly known throughout The Third Man as everyone is talking about him. But when you see him, his charisma and skill are apparent. His monologue in the Ferris Wheel is particularly wonderful. I wish he were in the movie even more.\n\nIn all, The Third Man is certainly still worth watching. It is perhaps the greatest character reveal in cinematic history, and that is not hyperbole.",

Harry gave himself over to greed and trivialized the worth of life, the lives of suffering women and children so he could line his pockets with money. Harry is also subjective truth or Nihilism at its epitome. Lie to yourself enough and you will believe it.

Joseph Cotton's character is more of a snarky annoyance than anything else, and Alida Valli looks half-bored most of the time. Welles is about the only interesting character, yet gets about 5 minutes of total screen time. The story being told just isn't very interesting, with few exciting twists and turns. It all rolls along with little investment being generated. Too much time is spent on inane conversations and arguments Cotton has with the authorities. But maybe the most frustrating aspect of it is the music. I can't for the life of me work out why the score is so highly regarded. It's not terrible, it just feels like it belongs in a completely different movie. What kind of dark, suspenseful neo-noir movie has lively, jaunty guitar music? It would be more at home during a Charlie Chaplin or Laurel & Hardy slapstick routine, not for policemen chasing a potential murder suspect down the street at night. For me nothing about it lived up to its reputation. I've seen legendary films I loved and ones I just didn't connect with. The Third Man falls squarely into the latter camp.",

            "content": "All is absurd.  The war is over, Vienna is in ruins, and the black market reigns.  The Allies have divided the city into zones, and the long reach of the Soviets is beginning to assert itself.  When a pulp fiction writer (Joseph Cotten) arrives looking for his friend but finds he's died under what seem like suspicious circumstances, he doesn't know who to trust.  His friend's associates are shady, and the authorities uncaring.  Morality itself also seems to be in ruins.\n\nStrong direction from Carol Reed, excellent cinematography Robert Krasker, and a musical score from Anton Karas based entirely on the zither make for a unique, and very good film.  Cotten, Alida Valli (the girlfriend), and Trevor Howard (the investigating major) all turn in solid performances, but it's Orson Welles who is absolutely brilliant, though his role is smaller.  His acting is fantastic in the scene at the top of the Ferris wheel, where, among other things, he comments so blithely on doing harm to his fellow man by saying \"Victims?  Don't be melodramatic.  Look down there. Tell me, would you really feel any pity if one of those dots stopped moving forever?  If I offered you twenty thousand pounds for every dot that stopped, would you really, old man, tell me to keep my money, or would you calculate how many dots you could afford to spare?  Free of income tax, old man. Free of income tax - the only way you can save money nowadays.\"\n\nIt's the rationalization of evil, made easier when done from a distance, which is truly horrifying.  Hitler had just been defeated after almost unimaginable sacrifice and human cost, a real triumph, and yet, evil is still alive and well with humanity.\n\nThe existential absurdity of it all is accentuated with frequent camera shots which are tilted at odd angles, and that zany zither music.  To be honest, I'm still not sure how I feel about the music.  At times it seemed to provide a nice counterpoint to the action, such as a chase scene through dark streets, highlighting how crazy this nightmare of a situation is, and at other times, it seems comically wacky, and out of place in a noir film.\n\nThe film is a little methodical in the first hour, but I thought the dry dialog was stylish, and loved the shadows and street scenes.  The international flavor and hearing German was nice.  Even if you suspect who Welles might be when he shows up, I believe the film effectively wrong foots us, in the sense of who is evil in this story.  It turns out that it may just be your old chum, the biggest nightmare of all.  It also wrong foots us with that ending, which Reed had to fight for, and which is outstanding.",

Harry Lime (Orson Welles) is somebody who feels that his friendship with Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) can help him get out of trouble; which becomes complicated in Harry's situation.

I like a good murder mystery, and there was a number of interesting puzzles to solve as the movie progressed. The cast is quite good, in particular I loved the scenes where Joseph Cotten interacted with Trevor Howard or Orson Welles. They had some intense sequences with more going on than what each character would come right out and say. My biggest struggle with The Third Man was the fact that there was no mystery in it for me. I figured out what was going on very early, and I can't even explain why I was so convinced that I was correct, but turns out I was right all along. This took away a lot of the intrigue, and there wasn't enough other stuff going on in the story that I could keep my interest level high. It's not a total failure of the film or the script, but part of my enjoyment in murder mysteries is the struggle to unravel the truth, and I didn't get that here. It also felt like the stakes were low, and that sucked some of the tension out of the climax. Finally, it's worth a mention that this movie's score should probably go on an all-time worst list. It is almost all composed of one tune played on a zither again and again to the point where I wanted to scream. It becomes downright oppressive to the point where I dread the next break in the action because I know that music is coming. Aside from this frustration I'll admit The Third Man is well-made, and probably deserving of all the critical praise, but it was only OK for me.",

The film plays out patiently, as our protagonist begins to dig into what exactly happened to his friend and the mystery elements truly shine, especially when he receives different accounts of what took place in the automobile \"accident\". The film also stars Orson Welles as the aforementioned friend, Harry Lime, who receives top billing though he is maybe on-screen for 8 minutes total: which leads into my big problem with this film. Without spoiling too much, the reveal that arrives at about the one hour mark is masterfully done and one of the film's more iconic scenes, but we're never given any explanation as to what the motive was and it feels like the filmmakers were trying to be so clever, they didn't worry about the scenario making sense. The film also incorporates a stringed instrument called a zither to score the music and while I can tell they were going for something unique, the sound is too absurd, especially in the more dramatic scenes, and the music actually sounds identical to the music used in SpongeBob SquarePants! Overall, this is an exceptionally-made film that still holds up today, but there are some questionable moments that stood out to me and it suffers a bit from what's come out since.",

They are all involved, in their own ways, in nihilist moral systems that compliment the dark, post-war Vienna shot in a visionary and innovating way. It is, as 'the fellow' says, in extreme badass.\nIts only possible con may be that due to the style of rushed storytelling modern cinema follows, 'The Third Man' may result a bit dense and slow to some, specially those used to non-thought-provoking movies.\nAnyway it is definitely one highly recommendable picture, full of thrill and suspense and aforementioned great acting.

If you're somewhat well read about movies, you know that Orson Welles is showing up eventually, which kind of kicks the wind out of that particular plot twist.\n\nStill, it was exciting to finally watch it after all these years.  Wonderful character performances from the cast, fascinating camera work.  You can tell that Carol Reed was heavily influenced both by Welles' own innovations and by the Italian neo-realists.  Characters casually clamber through the beautiful remnants and ignored brickheaps of post-war Vienna, divided by Allied powers and as yet untouched by the Marshall Plan.  You'd never imagine sewers could be so dramatic.\n\nMovie acting styles were not yet influenced by the Method school that would soon come.  Joseph Cotten probably came off reasonably well by 1949 standards as the sulky alcoholic Holly Martins.  I couldn't help wonder what a more brooding presence of someone like Montgomery Clift might have offered the role. \n\nStill, this is a bucket list movie.  Checked.",

In Switzerland they had brotherly love - they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock. So long Holly\".\n\nThe Third Man is about Harry Lime who has died in a car accident. Previously he had invited one of his closest friends to join him. His friend now must find out if the story is true and the mystery behind it.\n\nThe Third Man or best known has Orson Welles second best movie with Citizen Kane still at number 1. This time Carol Reed takes the directing chair and not Orson Welles but I got to be honest here I actually thought that Orson Welles directed this movie just by the way it was shot and acted it looked like his kind of film, because while watching the movie I didn't do any research on the film so I just watch the movie without nothing about the film and while watching the movie I was wounding if Orson Welles directed it's not until the end credits when I find out that Carol Reed directed it. Orson Welles and Carol Reed are both genius when it comes to movies and The Third Man isn't anything different as this is one of the best movies ever made.\n\nCarol Reed directing in this movie is absolutely magnificent and pure cinema gold. At times I felt like I was watching a Orson Welles movie just by the way it was shot and how it was acted and how it was executed made it feel like another great movies all together in one. Carol Reed was a fantastic director for this movie as he made a brilliant mystery thriller like The Third Man. Nice work Carol Reed. \n\nThe movie has this gloomy but yet a wide cinematic feeling to it that made this movie truly special then it is. With every shot in this movie that's both stunning and dazzling to my eyes. The famous scene in the sewers with that ionic image of Orson Welles is cinematography at it's best. Excellent work Robert Krasker the Cinematography of the movie. \n\nJoseph Cotten and Orson Welles both did a outstanding performance in this movie and so did everyone else in the film. Everyone in the movie delivered so much to they characters and to be honest I didn't find anyone else in the movie that did a terrible job. You can tell while watching the movie that these actors put a lot into they characters and it paid off brilliantly.\n\nNow for the problems that I had with this movie: I honestly didn't find a single thing that was a problem to me or even a flaw in this movie. You could say that it might be perfect, do I think it's perfect? well yeah, I do.\n\nOverall The Third Man is a movie that's absolutely worth checking out. These some other things in the movie that I could have brought up but to be honest and I do bring this up a lot and for good reasons. I want you the viewer to watch this movie like I did by not knowing much about the movie but only knowing the praise the movie got, I'm telling you to do this so you can experience what I experience. The Third Man is a classic at it's best.",

It felt akin to the score in Moonrise Kingdom, which worked in that atmosphere but, for me, detracted from the drama in certain scenes in this film.  \n\nGrade = 8/10",

Certainly one of the most beautifully filmed black and whites ever, with many great scenes including one of film's all-time most famous twists, and with what's widely considered to be the greatest and saddest closing shot in movie history.  It's postwar setting gives it a realism that has prevented it from looking dated in any way.  Vienna in all it's worn torn rubble is filmed beautifully and eerily at the same time.\nIf you've never seen The Third Man, you must.  \nYou're welcome",

Joseph Cotton is very disappointing as the lead, neither very convincing nor very likeable in the role.  Orson Welles is much more effective, playing a despicable man with no morals and no real concern for the woman who has been deeply in love with him and can never quite perceive what a self-centered cad he is.  Alida Valli is good in the role of the love interest.  But I didn't find this story involving enough, lacking real mystery and a lead character we care much about.  And the incessant strumming of the zither, or whatever it is, becomes increasingly annoying as we hear it play the same tune in scene after scene.

I have to say, although I can't disagree, that I found the musical score to be one of the most anticlimactic pieces ever performed on a movie. It is one of the most notable aspects of the movie but it just didn't work with me, very awkward and detracted too much from the experience. For some reason I couldn't really connect with this movie, I don't think the score is the only thing to blame, but I still can't quite articulate exactly why or what it is... seems like there's some lack of cinematic nuance or stylistic identity, I dunno, it felt flat overall... also something very artificial about the way things develop on the screen, the acting (although generally very good) at moments seemed opaque, very theatrical not subtle, I know this was normal back then, but in Hitchcock movies it never felt so unnatural as in this movie... A pity because this is an intelligent and complex work with great dialogue and humour, interesting camera work and cinematography (even if I was expecting a bit more quality here, but maybe the bluray rip I downloaded injured the true aspect of the picture...). I liked especially those moments where Orson Welles showed up, his acting always seems great to me, I like him very much as an actor and director although I still have seen few of his directed movies. Apparently ambiguous impressions of The Third Man... I wish I could be clearer but this film doesn't compel me to write much either. The rating I give is not an expression of the imparted entertainment nor the affection I have for this work (low), but as an acknowledgement of its cinematic and formal qualities. I suspect it's my own fault I didn't enjoy it more...",

            "content": "Directed by Carol Reed, The Third Man is an enjoyable adaptation of the novella of the same name by Graham Greene. Interestingly, the novella was originally intended to serve as a screenplay of sorts as its author hoped it would be picked up by Hollywood execs and be turned into a feature film. It is for this reason that the story effortlessly translates onto the screen and play as a very well done adaptation. The film, like all good films should, draws from a number of different sources to use varying techniques to tell its story. Like the novella, the film is about a struggling writer who intends to find who killed his friend he was supposed to be staying with during his stay in Italy. The backdrop of a post WWII Italy doesn't add too much to the plot directly, aside of fleshing out the world and giving it a sense of believability. The performances by the film's cast are all top-notch, playing to conventions of the Film Noir genre, and having immense fun while doing so. Reed shows his craft skills in a film that never slows down and always keeps its audience interested.\nI have much more to say about the film creatively as its visual language for me is the much more rich aspect of the film. Drawing from the Western, German Expressionism, and Italian Neo-Realism, it runs at a rampant pace from the very opening sequence, and thankfully never slows down. The pace of even the establishing sequence is frenetic, and may be confusing to some. However, it makes sense in the grand scheme of the film, as it's meant to set up the pace for the film's climatic sequence in the sewers. We expect to come back to a frantic scene like the opening, and Reed gives us just that. Our hero is decked out in all the Noir staples - fedora, trench coat, and a nice suit. He loves a good glass of liquor and isn't afraid to approach a woman he's enchanted with. By making him a \"convention\" The audience is immediately comfortable with our hero. Sure he's not perfect and in no way a \"good moral\" character, but we know what he's about just by looking at him. Reed is smart in playing to staples of the Noir genre so that he can focus his attention on the plot - the mystery, what happened to Henry Lime? Ms. Schmidt is another example of this. Almost every scene has some sort of double entendre going on, usually through the dialogue. Ms. Schmidt as a character for example, is an actress, which is almost always used to echo someone's own character arch in the plot. Actors are people who pretend, and become other people - and as the plot thickens, we see Schmidt do this herself, wanting to become one thing for Holly while holding onto the life she had with Lime; we're never really sure if she's leading Holly on until the last act. In the scene in which Holly and Schmidt go to a bar, they both drink whiskey, and one of the villains, Baron Kurtz, orders two double whiskeys. This is an implication that he is a double-crosser, one who isn't honest with Schmidt or Holly. \"The third man\" in question is portrayed wonderfully by Orson Welles, who conveys a tragic man who wants to be left alone and hold onto Schmidt, his love. This motif of \"having your cake and eating it too\" is in some way portrayed by every character. Visual motifs are used constantly, through alcohol, a small boy, and animals. Cats seem to be associated with the protagonist, but shown in a scene of calm, while a small dog belongs to Kurtz, an antagonist, implying that he is a \"dog\". Lime and Holly meet at a rundown carnival - a place of fun juxtaposing this dramatic, intense moment between friends as their friendship is coming undone. They hop aboard a Ferris wheel and as they reach the top the wheel, so does the height of their conversation. The final shot of the film combines all of the film styles that Reed employs. It is a long shot, composed to let the audience notice the background, a landscape; this is a western convention. It shows our hero, smoking, waiting for his woman, leaving his airplane ticket for love; very much a noir setup. And finally, instead of running to his arms for the smooch that would seal it all, she rejects him, off to fulfill her own life. She doesn't need a man right now; employing realism. This is fantastically executed film and one for any who enjoy Film Noir and its charming conventions.",

When American pulp novelist Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) travels to Vienna to visit old friend Harry Lime, he arrives only to learn that Lime was recently hit by a car and died. After a police major makes insulting comments about Lime, Martins sets out to prove him wrong and almost immediately realizes there is more to the accident than meets the eye, soon finding himself stuck squarely in the middle of two warring sides. This is the most beautiful Noir I have seen, the dark alleys and corners are fully explored to beautiful effect here, completely filling the screen and Orsen Welles puts on a fine performance as a man many believe to be bad but is much more complex than that. He makes for a charming and lovable POS, and amazingly one we feel great sympathy for. This is one of the more different and unique noirs you can see since it doesn't follow any of your typical noir story lines. Definitely a must see, and it's guaranteed that you won't ever forget the name Harry Lime once the film ends.",

The lighting and stark settings within the city exude somber mood, making things feel uneasy and uncertain, just like the main character. Wide camera angles, tilted perspectives, creative viewpoints, and high-contrast lighting reinforce these feelings all the more. The climax is a thrilling set of chase scenes moving through the city and down into the city sewers. These last scenes are boldly sublime and display an impressive level of craft and directorial creativity. They are a joy to watch and are exciting even by today's standards. The story is not a typical feel-good formula, but the great acting, tense action, sincere emotion and rich character complexities make this a rewarding to watch more than once.

Once the evidence is unveiled, you better allow yourself to focus on other parts of the movie, such as the action, setting, music, or camera work. The thrill of The Third Man is that all of these elements (writing, directing, acting, and designing) are masterfully handled. American novelist Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) flies to Vienna, a city that is closed off by international polices since the end of World War II, to meet with his friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles). When Martins is told that Lime was killed in traffic and is told by Major Calloway (Trevor Howard) that it may not have been an accident, Martins decides to investigate the case himself. Matters become even more complicated when Lime is revealed to be a black market dealer who sells mentally damaging medicines to children, along with other undisclosed files. This is classic noir, but the scenes are open to lively interactions. Every moment between Cotten and Welles is memorable.\n\nBeyond The Third Man's well-paced storyline, the film proudly shows off its setting and music from the very beginning. The opening credits appear in front of Anton Karas playing a zither, the sole musical accompaniment for the movie. Carol Reed made a bold move, choosing an Austrian string instrument over the standard orchestra, but it was a move worth making. Where an orchestra can sometimes enlighten you that you are watching a movie, the zither evokes a feeling that there happens to be some guy playing music around the corner of the scene.\n\nAfter the credits finish, Reed conducts a tour through Vienna with the audience, keeping us in touch with the current state of affairs. Reed never lets down throughout the picture, presenting Vienna in all of its wonders, from peaceful market squares to building debris, and eventually down in the sewers. Cinematographer Robert Krasker works well with Reed's vision, usually presenting every scene with this grand scope. His best shot is the very last one, which holds out for over a minute in silence, minus the zither. Despite the major conflict being resolved by this point, this shot is still suspenseful.\n\nThis is how I enjoy my Christmas night, of course - by watching films considered to be cinematic masterpieces. In the case of The Third Man, I will not dispute that claim.",

The trust between celluloid and the audience comes from the film's hero, Holly Martins. This achievement belongs to Joseph Cotten. But its the atmosphere that is the most endearing aspect of this classic 1949 treasure of a movie. This is film presents an engrossing experience from start to finish, and absolutely everything about it is pitch perfect. From Vienna at midnight to Trevor Howard's often dismissed, but completely wonderful performance as Major Calloway (Not Callahan, He's British, Not Irish). Orson Welles delivers one of the best performances of all time, due partly to the scene atop a Ferris Wheel, and mostly to his absence, and the care taken by writer Graham Greene in creating a perfect character without ever actually seeing him. Joseph Cotten is superb, hasn't been this good since his lead role in Shadow Of A Doubt or his strong support in Citizen Kane. He makes Holly Martins down to earth, brave, headstrong, and truly American. Alida Valli is breathtaking, and because of her, Anna Schmidt is a character we take joy in watching, making Anna Schmidt one of the greater love interest in the Film Noir genre. The photography is incredible, the city enormous and isolating, the characters are canon, the story is timeless, and the film is perfect. The only hands down and flat out perfect film of the 1940s.

At his funeral, Holly meets British Major Calloway (Trevor Howard) and Sergeant Paine who had been tracking Harry Lime before his death, investigating black market dealing of dangerous counterfeit medicines.  He also notices Harry Lime's girlfriend Anna Schmit (Alida Valli) who he tracks down acting in a theatre and befriends.  Soon, the porter at Martins' hotel lets on that there's doubt over whether Harry Lime had really died.  The rest of the story sees Martins build a relationship with Anna and explore what happened to Harry.\n\nThe film is remarkable for its iconic black and white photography and its zither score.  There are some great photographic scenes.  Most memorable are:\n\n- Underground sewer shots, with all sorts of curved tunnels and angular passageways, spiral staircases, stone textured tiles and bricks, and distinctive manhole covers each with 6 triangular flaps\n- Deserted fairground big wheel as a backdrop for Martins to meet Harry Lime\n- Night scenes in Vienna with light reflecting off wet cobble stones\n- Symmetry of staircases in Anna's apartment block\n- Symmetry of the avenue from the graveyard with Anna walking \n\nThe score provides a strong signature tune.  Played by Anton Karas with a zither, it has the flavour of a flamenco rift, playful but with a slightly sinister undertone.  On paper you would not expect a flamenco style tune to work on a post war thriller set in Vienna, but it works superbly well.",

If you're looking for flying bullets, explosions and breaking glass, go elsewhere.  But if you want a film that intrigues and amuses, a film with a strong, but battered heart, you've found it.",

It also starts off a little bit slow.\n\nThe Third Man builds up as we delve deeper into the story and the characters are put in more important situations where we get to witness their acting skills. \nJoseph Cotton makes a powerful and charismatic lead ensuring that his character has constant strength and never goes in a wrong direction.\nAlIda Valli had some excellent moments in The Third Man as well and kept the tone monotonous for her character when necessary and managed to evoke great emotional strength in others.\nIn a surprisingly villainous turn, the talented Orson Welles portrays a strongly evil and manipulative character that we never could have expected. He was very powerful.\n\nSo The Third Man is successful as a classic noir film, as well as a classic Orson Welles feature. Even though the pacing was a little slow and it sort of felt like things weren't going on at times, the visual style and internal qualities were really good.",

I was brought up to believe that this film was a masterpiece and in many ways it is. The story is intriguing and involves characters which are too complex to be deemed either sympathetic or thoroughly bad. The way the film is shot, using shadows, empty streets, odd camera angles and moody shots creates an almost gothic claustrophobic atmosphere in a city devastated by war. But in the end, the films strengths become it's weaknesses, as the dutch angles and the repetitive melody played on the zither became a bit irritating for my taste. Still though, this is a classic, stylish and iconic film, of unique time and place.",
