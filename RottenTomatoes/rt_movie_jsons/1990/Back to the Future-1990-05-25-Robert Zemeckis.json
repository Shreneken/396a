Fox) obtains a 70-year-old message from the time-traveling Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd), in which he informs Marty that he has retired to a small town in the Old West.

In order to save his friend, Marty will have to travel back in time, disentangle a lovestruck Doc from a local schoolmarm, and repair the DeLorean -- all while avoiding a posse of gunslingers.",

            "content": "Back to the Future 3 is an entertaining movie that offers a satisfying conclusion to the beloved time-traveling trilogy. As a fan of the series, I was excited to see how the story would wrap up and was not disappointed.\n\nOne of the highlights of the movie is the setting. The Wild West backdrop offers a refreshing change of scenery from the previous two films and adds a new dimension to the story. The costumes and sets are also well-done and add to the immersive experience.\n\nThe chemistry between the characters, especially between Marty and Doc, remains a strong point of the film. The friendship between the two is endearing and their interactions are always fun to watch.\n\nHowever, the movie does have some flaws. The plot feels a bit repetitive at times and doesn't quite have the same sense of urgency and tension as the first two films. Additionally, some of the humor feels forced and falls flat.\n\nOverall, Back to the Future 3 is a solid conclusion to a great trilogy. While it may not quite match the high bar set by its predecessors, it still manages to entertain and offer a satisfying end to the story.",

            "content": "\"Back to the Future\" is a timeless classic that has captivated audiences for decades. This iconic film, directed by Robert Zemeckis and released in 1985, tells the story of Marty McFly, a teenage boy who is accidentally sent back in time to 1955 in a time machine invented by his eccentric scientist friend, Doc Brown.\n\nOne of the strengths of \"Back to the Future\" is its clever script, which seamlessly weaves together elements of science fiction, comedy, and romance. The film's plot is both entertaining and engaging, as Marty must navigate the challenges of the 1950s while also figuring out how to get back to his own time.\n\nThe performances in the film are also top-notch. Michael J. Fox shines as Marty McFly, bringing both humor and heart to his portrayal of the time-traveling teenager. Christopher Lloyd is equally impressive as Doc Brown, imbuing the character with a sense of wacky energy and intelligence that makes him a delight to watch.\n\nBut what truly sets \"Back to the Future\" apart is its ability to appeal to a wide range of audiences. Whether you're a fan of science fiction, comedy, or simply great storytelling, this film has something for everyone. It's a movie that has stood the test of time, and is just as enjoyable to watch today as it was when it was first released.\n\nOverall, \"Back to the Future\" is a must-see movie that has earned its place in cinematic history. With its engaging plot, memorable characters, and witty dialogue, it's a film that will continue to entertain and inspire audiences for years to come.",

            "content": "Overall, \"Back To The Future Part III\" is a really good closer to the \"Back To The Future\" trilogy.  It was not nearly as good as the 88 MPH classic, but it was just at the same level as \"Back To The Future Part II.\" The visuals of the 1885, Old West style of Hill Valley are really well-done.  Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, and Thomas F. Wilson are just as good as ever, with Thomas F. Wilson acting better and more naturally than in \"Back To The Future Part II\".  The behind-the-scenes romantic drama between Doc Brown (Lloyd) and Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen) was done really well.  In summary, \"Back To The Future Part III\" will keep you going at 88 MPH in your seat, like the last two \"Back To The Future\" movies did.  If you have time, and you have watched the previous two \"Back To The Future\" movies, then you really should watch \"Back To The Future Part III\".  \"Back To The Future\" was actually a franchise that had some really good sequels, unlike some other franchises, where the original was such a classic, and there were some sequels that were not really that good.  \"Marty! It runs on steam!\".",

            "content": "A Good Conclusion to a Classic Trilogy. The acting is good in this with really Lloyd taking most of the screen time and he carries it well. The romance is well done and Mad Dog is arguably the most intimidating of all the Tannen's. I would say the only thing is the acting isn't as strong as the other 2 overall mainly because Lloyd and Fox don't interact as much as in the other 2. The cinematography is good with well framed shots and the West setting is memorable. the main problems with it though is there are some really dumb and out of place scenes (The Bear, Marty wearing a Pink cowboy Outfit, Moonwalking) and some of the CGI looks out of place. The music is good also although I'd say its the weakest of the 3 mainly because its a western score mixed with the BTTF soundtrack and it doesn't mesh as well as you'd like but there good on their own right. The editing and pacing are very well done here also really being the only complaint just the dumb scenes meant to get a laugh feel out of place in the western setting and feel more slapstick gag-like than the other 2 movies which were more witty with their jokes. Overall definitely watch this once at least for a solid conclusion to the trilogy. The train scene at the end minus the CGI is really well done and exhilarating to watch and makes it worth the time.",

Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Crispin Glover, Thomas F. Wilson have become like family to me, and I don't want to say goodbye to them at all.\n\nThe last film of the trilogy is the most extraordinary, because here all the action takes place in the Wild West, and, accordingly, the picture has become mostly a western, but not without a fantastic component. All the same beloved characters are present in the frame, but with a funny change - Thomas F. Wilson (Biff Tannen) now plays his ancestor - Bufford Tanenna, the famous bandit. This is the beauty of the plot, because in fact in the entire trilogy there is only one obvious negative character, and with the name Tannen!\n\nAlso in all the films is the famous Hill Valley cafe, which is in all time periods of history, and in 1885 it was a saloon!\n\nVery fortunate in the third film was the fact that Emmett Brown found a lover. And found successfully. Mary Steenbergen played the role of Christopher Lloyd's Clara - a little absent-minded, completely sincere, sweet and fond of Jules Verne. Only such a woman could win the Doc's heart!\n\nOf course, at the end of the picture, you feel sorry for the time machine itself. Although Doc Brown made convincing arguments about the dangers of time travel, but in three films she became very dear and close to all viewers. And how delightful it was to see Doc Brown come back from the past, which would seem already unthinkable, in a new time machine-engine and with his family to boot!\n\nOne cannot but mention the outstanding music of Alan Silvestri, which ranks among the best soundtracks in the world. When the title theme starts to play, goosebumps immediately run through the skin, because it portends amazing adventures and exciting action!\n\nBack to the Future 3 is a must-see and recap, because such pictures are becoming less and less common and you should not deny yourself the pleasure. And in the case of Back to the Future, it is guaranteed to be! Sit back and fly at 88 miles per hour!!!",

For the most part the movie was fun and pretty engaging but, I feel like after the mid point of the movie, we rush the story and especially Doc and his new love interest. The worst part though is that Doc ends up staying in the past which doesn't really make sense to me regarding the fact that for the first 2 movies, and the entirety of this one, we've been trying to return to present time so that the space time continuum doesn't tear apart. But now Doc gets to stay in the 19th century and, on top of that, produce offspring that aren't even supposed to be there? It throws time out of balance which is what they've been trying to avoid the whole series. It just feels like an unsatisfying ending to a really good series. Overall, the story was fun but the timing of the movie and, it trying to make a lot of sense, takes off a couple stars for me.\n\nI give it 2 1/2 flying time traveling trains",

I also think Doc is written the best in this trilogy. The subplot with his love interest, Carla is actually sweet and it's nice seeing Doc as a real person, not just a scientist, thinking about his future and what he wants and Marty concludes his arc set in the second movie about not being peer pressured and that 3rd act is so intense just like the previous two movies. I just wonder how Marty will survive and that final moment with the train is perfect.

I would have preferred more scenes of the future but will settle for less scenes of the gritty alternative 1985 from the second one, and the plot's primary focus being on a love angle instead of another dose of materialism was good. Silvestri even seemed to regain control of his bombastic score to make it more accurately match the tone of the scenes it was for. All of these things were excellent changes, but in the end the sheer strength of the storytelling and the interest I still had in seeing this series to its conclusion had waned quite a bit and thus the movie is significantly less memorable than either of the other two had been.",

The concept is pretty strung on, with a story pulled out of left field, to keep the series going for one more round. Part 3 was supposed to be apart of Part 2, but they figured with the duration, and content, they had two films on their hands. Maybe because I'm not the biggest western guy, but other than Part 3 being the funniest of the bunch, it didn't pack the punch the other films did. The story may come off a little light, but Part 3 finds it's footing, coming off a jumbled Part 2. Zemeckis, Spielberg & Gale didn't add as much time traveling, keeping the narrative focused, like the first.\n\nMichael J. Fox continues his bold, yet charming role, but he didn't have much character development, due to the fact that he didn't have much to do in this film. The standout of the film was Doc! He got the most screen time as of yet, getting some interesting pieces added to his character. The greatest thing about this film, was the chemistry Fox & Llyod built over this short, five year span. Mary Steenburgen was a rare pleasure of someone who plays a sudden love for a main character. Clara was a great compliment to Doctor Brown, helping expand his character. Thomas F. Wilson returns once again, to be our antagonist, but his role is pretty outplayed already.\n\nThe screenplay by Robert Zemeckis & Bob Gale, had the same charm, and familiar lines from the films prior. With the western spin on it, it helped make this film the funniest out of the trilogy.\n\nThe production design by Rick Carter, who also did the design for Back to the Future Part 2, looked great, while really capturing that western feel. Part 3 was less reliant on the effects, other than the time travel scenes, really. The costume design by Joanna Johnston & Chuck Velasco had that great western feel, but the costumes stood too clean, for a dirty, dusty film.",

Whilst Part 2 was not as good as the first, the characters are the same and it still has the charm to it. Now I will know what I could think of the third one and I've watched this twice now. I watched it after I finish watching Part I and II and now III. With it I finally watched the entire trilogy in one day. Just like I did with the others of course. After the events of Part II while being stranded in 1885 during his time travel adventures, Marty discovers that his friend Dr. Emmett Brown is trapped in the year 1885. He was killed by Buford Tannen, played by Thomas F. Wilson, who is Biff's great-grandfather. Marty then travels to 1885 to rescue Doc and return once again to 1985, but matters are complicated when Doc falls in love with Clara Clayton, played by Mary Steenburgen. You can tell from the cover that it's taken place in the western world where there's cowboys and indians. Due to the fact that this is the final part of the trilogy I don't feel any perfections in this not to say that it's the weakest but to clear up the fact that this is a western but some sci-fi moments in it. It contains some same scenes that you've seen before, Marty McFly wakes up in Lorraine's bedroom thinking that this is a dream but he realise that he's in a different year it's not. In Part II he walks away from Griff and then he calls him chicken and he hates being called chicken. In this one he just he calls him yellow and he hates being called that too. You get all the rest. Now with new scenes which are ripping off pop culture references when Marty wakes up again thinking about dueling with Buford Tannen making references to Robert De Niro from Taxi Driver and Clint Eastwood (which he calls himself) from Sudden Impact. I like the train scene after Marty fights with Buford in the third act and I also like the ending of this film after when the DeLorean is destroyed just like Doc wanted. An ending to the trilogy is what I love about when it gets wrapped up even when it says \"THE END\". So that's it for the Back to the Future trilogy. I hope you stick with me throughout all this. I know it's been a long journey but it's worth it. I still the first one because it executes perfection, the second is similar in terms of scenes and time travel but does it differently and now the third one is the last of the franchise. Thomas F. Wilson stole the show from three films, he's funny, he's psychotic and his performance is charming and intelligent. There's a cartoon series after this which I haven't seen but you can watch in the bonus disc when you own the entire trilogy. And I guess that's a wrap at this rate. Back to the Future is over and done with.",

They introduced a new character called Clara Clayton (who bonded a relationship with Emmett Brown) and the character development for the character was on the mark because you got to understand the character.\n\n  Now let's talk about plot holes: When they were looking to find the DeLorean, how did they know where it was. The other plot holes are to do with the fact that most of the equipment that was used in the film, wasn't to created till after the time period that the film was set. A final plot hole is that if Emmett Brown was killed in 1885, wouldn't his 1955 self be killed. My other problem with this movie is that some of the scenes in the movie was copied from the first Back To The Future. I don't know if that was deliberate or if they were running out of ideas. \n\nThe ending scene for this movie was one of the best scenes in the movie because when Emmett Brown came back to 1985, I was blown away because I found it, completely unexpected. So that made the film even more powerful. The action scene in this film was hilarious, especially the showdown with Mad Dog. The train scene at the end was the most powerful scene in the film due to its intense score which kept me on the edge of my seat. Overall, Back To The Future Part III withholds its epic score and thrilling scenes that will keep you on the edge of your seat. \nGrade B+ - A powerful ending",

The humor is a wonderful mix of references from the other films in the series, which i obviously love and tear up to, and the western genre itself. Regardless of the pace of all the movies in the series, the climax in each one of them,  and specifically in this one, gets your heart racing with a strange suspense (because you know it is bound to end positively). There are flashes of memorable scenes for the fans of this series. But my favorite will undoubtedly be the sons of doc brown and clara, jules and verne.",

And the villain helps keep the masculine members of the Tannens' status as the ultimate assholes in cinematic history intact. So, while we're VERY unlikely to get a possible Part IV (why would you want that? It ended perfectly), thanks to Michael J.

Perhaps it might have worked if Zemeckis mixed up the present and the past more, injecting futuristic elements into the antiquated setting and turning the film into a delirious sci-fi hodgepodge.

Robert Zemeckis is still good at directing, and Alan Silvestri's music is very well done. The special effects are good, but they're some that are slightly dated.

            "content": "Back to the Future Part 3 marks the finale of the BTTF trilogy and takes the series out on a high despite not managing to live up to its two predecessors. This time around, the Delorean has taken Marty and Doc way back to the year 1885 where the film decides to spend all of its time. Going back to sticking to one time period was what needed to be done after they spent the entire second film jumping around the past, present and future. The choosing of the Old West (as was hinted at in BTTFII) was an interesting one and definitely felt very different from the last two films, and i guess Zemeckis was forced to take this route in order to not be rehashing the exact same thing. We had already been to 1955 twice and been to 2015, so the only way to make a third film without being too overly repetitive was to go way back to 1885. \n\nI enjoyed seeing the 1885 setting, seeing how Hill Valley looked way back then, and seeing the history of the famous McFlys and Tannens was pretty cool. But you quickly realise that there really isn't much new you can do in 1885 that hasn't been done countless other times in Westerns or in the other films. And that led the film makers to fill Marty's time in 1885 with countless callbacks to the previous films, some very subtle and some extremely obvious. A lot of this film was spent making those comical callbacks and trying to recreate scenes from the previous films, and they were some of the most entertaining moments of the film but the repetitiveness of these moments starts to kinda show, especially after you watch the films back to back to back. But i would much rather the film accept that it isn't much different and make that as obvious as it can as oppose to try to be something completely different when it isn't. One thing that returned that no-one can complain about is the zany, crazy humour that Doc has brought to the series from the very beginning. As with the other films, seeing Doc and Marty back together trying to solve a new problem was great, they are always fun to watch and no matter how many BTTF films they made, these two would have always remained just as funny and entertaining. \n\nThis film introduces a new main character for the first time in the series really, the previous films have stuck to the same characters in different time periods but here, Clara Clayton factors fairly majorly into the plot. You quickly find out that the main reason she was put in the film was really so that she could serve as a love interest for Doc, but the character also added something new that the other films didn't have. Until this point, the Doc had only really been this crazy scientist and this was his character in both the previous films, but by adding Clara into the mix it allowed the film to add another layer to Doc's character. It allows the film to at times focus on Doc for a little and give him what he deserves after the amount of time he spent helping out Marty get his future right. Some of these romantic scenes prove more of a hinderance to the overall plot but it all pays off in the end. Again i loved seeing the attention to detail and still managing to connect back to very subtle details in the previous films. A couple of my favourites were the subtle renaming of Clayton Ravine and also the many callback to 'A Fistful of Dollars' seen in this film and also BTTFII. \n\nLastly, this film did what countless other films struggle to do, it is one of the hardest tasks for any final film to do, especially for a film series this incredible. And it is; How do you close out a series in a way that honours all characters and makes sense to the plot and pleases all fans? Well, just ask Robert Zemeckis, because this may be the best or one of the best endings to a trilogy of films ever, everything was perfectly executed.\n\nObviously, spoilers for the ending here... By returning to 1985 and seeing that Marty's life is back to normal, everyone is happy, he has his car, and Jennifer is there it was so satisfying to see that all of their hard work had paid off. The decision to destroy the Delorean was great, during the entire series, all problems were caused from the existence of that time machine, and it was made clear that the only way to make sure nothing bad ever happened was to destroy it. So although seeing the iconic time machine being destroyed was heartbreaking, when you understand why, it makes so much sense. Also i loved the way they completely tied up that one loose end that BTTFII introduced that was never really explained. In BTTFII and also in this film you hear about this 'accident' that ruined Marty's life and led to him missing out on his music career and getting fired in 2015. But when you think back, they never actually stopped that event, so theoretically Marty should still grow up to where he gets fired in 2015. But GUESS AGAIN, because right at the end Needles shows up and tries to drag race Marty by calling him Chicken. Due to some wise words by Seamus in 1885 Marty decides not to race Needles and it turns out that if he did, he would have had an accident that would have resulted in him injuring his hand and thus, never playing music again. This was a great little detail that i loved seeing the film address. \n\nBut you can't end Back to the Future without saying a final goodbye to the Iconic Dr. Emmett Brown. And wow did they handle his farewell amazingly. Having him show up in a brand new time machine was great and fit with his character in that time travel is part of his life now and in his now experienced hands it is safe. Seeing him have a family was a nice finishing touch to his character, to see him finally get a happy ending was great. And he exits with a great quote to tie up the whole series.\n\n\"Your future is whatever you make it, so make it a good one\" \n\n8.2/10",

But it has big flaws  scratch that Major flaws like their is nothing's memorable about this movie. The last movie had 2015 and the first one was just awesome but this movie only has the wild West and Emmett has a girlfriend but that's it. This movie I heard was made immediately right after they finished filming back to the future 2 so duh it's a little rushed. The people who wrote the script should have put a little more effort and it didn't pay off because of how low this movie grossed in theaters. Now for the good I like the characters of Marty Mcfly and Dr Emmett Brown and how they officially go home and that's probably the last we will see of them ever again in live action form. Don't forget about the awesome video game of this. See that's what the writers should have done, copied exactly what the video game did but oh well.

I know I know, I am possibly being a little unfair, and after the mess of part 2, I'm glad the franchise got its mojo back by pulling out part 1?s playbook. But did Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale have to follow it so closely? Scene after scene is almost exactly re-played with only a western twist to differentiate it. Couldn't they have limited the nods to the other films and pushed forward with something new?\n\nAnyway, minor complaints aside, part 3 is a great film, and like the 1985 original, it has a lot of heart. Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd and especially Thomas F. Wilson are back in fine form, and Mary Steenburgen as Clara is a very welcome addition to the cast. In fact, the best thing about part 3 is the sweet romance story between Doc Brown and Clara. It's also a fun adventurous ride, and a nice conclusion to this great set of films.\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nThe Back to the Future series requires you watch each in turn. Part 3 plays more like the first installment. A slower pace, and a simpler story. These are the films strengths though.\n\nBest Format:\n\nThe old west sets look great, and there are actually very few visual or makeup effects to worry about. A HD showing is recommended.\n\nBest element for me:\n\nThe romance between Doc Brown and Clara.\n\n-> http://www.TalkieGazette.com\n\n-> http://www.facebook.com/talkiegazette\n\n-> http://www.twitter.com/talkiegazette",

            "content": "\"Back to the Future: Part III\" is a fitting conclusion to the series.  While I find it to be the weakest of the three films, I still love to watch it and applaud it for giving a fresh spin to the familiar \"change the past to save your future self while trying not to disrupt the space-time continuum, all the while finding a way back home\" theme.  The change of scenery is a little extreme, but I guess that it makes sense for the writers to give us an imaginative look at the past after giving us an imaginative look at the future in the second film.  The entire trilogy has that 80's cheesiness running through it, keeping the films from becoming too dramatic and making the characters lovable, even the bad guys (well, especially the bad guys).  It isn't too much, but the third film definitely walks the line of being too cheesy with Marty calling himself Clint Eastwood and plenty of puns that remind us that they are in the Wild West instead of 1985.  That being said, the writers do an excellent job of providing Marty with a DeLorean, using the death dates to justify him travelling back, and helping Doc Brown to find what he has always been searching for.  They also gave Alan Silvestri a great excuse to combine his awesome \"Back to the Future\" theme with music from the Wild West.  ...And ZZ Top (see earlier comments about this film walking the line of being too cheesy).  The line is crossed during the film's Disney-esque ending where Doc Brown practically grabs the camera and, staring directly into its lens (and the souls of every audience member), says \"Here is the cheesy moral of the story and there's no tuning me out.\"  There are a few weak points but the acting is solid all the way around.  Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are just as great as the first two films but the best performances in Part III come from Thomas F. Wilson and Mary Steenburgen.  Wilson's slapstick portrayal of Mad Dog Tannen is inspired, blending intimidation with comedy and it is enhanced once you have seen him as Biff in Parts I and II.  Contrastingly, Steenburgen is captivating with her southern charm and feistiness when she tells off Doc.  It is unfortunate that the character requires her to go a little beyond her softspoken, refined disposition with the runaway carriage and the train scene; however, she has a lot of very nice moments in the film.  From start to finish, this is a solid film.  \"Back to the Future: Part III\" is a classic, particularly when used as the conclusion for one of the most inventive trilogies out there.",

The idea of mixing things up and gong to the Old West was a smart one though, and does provide some source of freshness in the series. The final act is very thrilling and different, making for a truly entertaining and conclusive end to the trilogy. It gets too goofy sometimes, and the story isn't that original, but the cast, new location, and exciting finale make it somewhat enjoyable. The strong last half hour makes up for a plodding opening, but this movie does an excellent job of ending this thrilling adventure. Back to the Future Part llI gets 3/5 stars (B-).",

Truthfully I enjoy this film very much, I like how they decided to go to the west because it actually looked really and such.

Another bonus is the use of the new Wild West setting. There is more originality in the third installment, we see a few things that are unique to it- Obviously the era is new, Doc gets a character arc in finding love/family, Marty's need to overcome his ego and issues with being challenged. But like the second we still have a lot of derivative material. (A version of the Tannen character falling in manure, Marty thinking its all a dream and that he is with the normal version of his mother-only to discover the bizarre reality, Doc saying \"Great Scott\", Marty being reunited with Jennifer at the end, hanging onto a changing picture that tells the characters where there fate is headed). Overall though the film is paced better and makes for a smoother ride than the bumpy #2. The love story with Doc & Clara is so hokey and the drama is laughably bad. Things remain pretty gimmicky, with the same several actors repeating the beats of previous adventures with different makeup on. The performances and makeup are never as awful as some parts of #2. The ending with Doc (who must be well into his 90's now) finding a  wife who gives him two children (despite that she looks to be pushing 55) is the pinnacle of happy but ridiculously unbelievable cornball endings. Also Verne is a creepy, creepy, little SOB- trust me, go to the brief scene he is featured in, just watch his every move and you'll see why. Doc should send him back in time to be eat by a T-Rex",

In many ways, this second sequel feels quite boring and basic in comparison to the last two films.  But I personally think that the saga needed something like this to finish everything off.  It tells a charming story about two friends trying to find a way back into the 1980's, without the use of plutonium, or the advantage of knowing when and where lightening will strike.  There are more opportunities for the audience learn about Marty and Emmett as people, and the love story between the Doc and Miss Clayton is quite sweet.  Add in a good many touches that will please long-time fans - such as the first uncovering of the clock tower, and the original roots of that shooting arcade-game from the local bar - and then an excellent finale with the DeLorean being pushed by a steam train, and you have another near-flawless movie, which puts to rest, respectfully and poignantly, this wonderfully timeless series.",

The first two acts are great and the third is as well, except for the ending.

It's not to bad, but really stick out amongst the other flaws and plot holes.

Gone are the out of place and unfunny scenes that seemed to pop up way too much in the second movie. Those are instead replaced with a very clear narrative, full of great character moments and genuine humor.\r\n\r\nPart 3 is much more like Part 1. It carries over the fun, the humor, and the clever storytelling that was lacking from Part 2. There's no rambling around looking for a plot device to movie the story along. It's content to tell a story. While the story barrows elements from the previous movies, the setting is completely different. The story's old west setting gives us a fresh view of out old favorite characters and jokes. Many of the jokes that carry through the series are present here, just scaled back in time to the 1890s. But it's done in such a fun and enthusiastic way, that it's hard not to enjoy.\r\n\r\nThe story picks up right where Part 2 left off. Marty must once again enlist the help of 1955 Doc Brown to transport him back to 1885. Once Marty gets back to 1885, he must prevent Doc Brown from being assassinated. If he is able to save Doc Browns life, he must then figure out a way to get back to 1985 and complete his crazy time traveling adventure.\r\n\r\nMichael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, and Thomas F. Wilson all return and are in top form. Fox once again plays a likeable Marty. Thankfully, the movie actually develops the character significantly over the course of the story (something the second failed to do). Lloyd is also just as good as ever. His character is finally given a plot point that doesn't revolve around Marty. It's a fresh twist for the character and a welcome one. Newcomer to the franchise, Mary Steenburgen is decent as Clara. The performance isn't anything new or special, but the character provides Doc Brown with a love interest. It's nice to have the Doc get a happy ending.\r\n\r\nThe story is very clever and tight. There aren't many holes in the plot, and it flows nicely. The humor is frequent, clever, and subtle. Much of the fun is had at the expense of the \"Old West\" setting. The movie is a brilliant parody of the western genre. Marty referring to himself as Clint Eastwood is an especially funny gag.  Also, there isn't the forced action that plagued most of the second movie. The movie relies on its big finale set piece, a train pushing the Delorean up to 88 MPH. This is right up there with the ending to the first movie in the excitement department. It's a breathless action scene that even throws in a pretty big surprise. All the Back to the Future movie have really good action scenes for their climax, and this one is no different.\r\n\r\nAbove all else, Back to the Future Part 3 returns the fun to the franchise. It ties up all the loose ends in a very orderly and satisfying way. Apart from the second entry, Robert Zemeckis really created something wonderful with this series. Full of humor, thrills, and a healthy dose of heart, Back to the Future Part 3 wholly satisfies.\r\n\r\n\"Everybody everywhere will say Clint Eastwood is the biggest yellow-belly in the west.\" 8/10",

Fox) is going back to find Doc (Christopher Lloyd) in the old west because he learns that Doc gets shot by an ancestor of Biff.

Marty and Doc are still great, but the new ones are really dull. Take Clara, Doc's love interest, who is more than forgettable. There's also Mad Dog Tannon, who isn't as fun and exciting as the other Biffs that we've seen.\n\nHowever, the story makes up for the weaker characters. Marty and Doc's fates are always swapping, and the atmosphere is nice. It was a pretty risky step to make it set int he west, especially after the others mostly took place in 1955.\n\nIn the end, this is an alright film.

To me, the film was more a homage to the \"Spaghetti\" Clint Eastwood westerns of the early 60s & going with the \"I'm gonna stay here with my love\" plotline really just didn't cut it. This was the least received, both critically & commercially (while it made enough to cover its' budget, it was still low) & using the plot of the first & the \"I choose to stay\" angle just wasn't worth it for me.\nSide fact: the sets for 1885 were built in Jamestown & Sonora, CA. I visited there on a road trip & obviously didn't see the sets as they were destroyed by lighting in 1996. I DID see the train tracks that Marty walks along & for the railroad scenes (but didn't make the connection)",

Oh and the Marty and Biff (Buford) Tannen battle becomes tiring after seeing it in the last two flaming films. This film feels like an add-on, and not a continuation, and that is just what it is.",
