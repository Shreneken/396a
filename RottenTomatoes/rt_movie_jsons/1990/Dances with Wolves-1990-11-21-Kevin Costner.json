Truly beautiful in score and scenery, the story is mesmerically narrated by the main character (KC), who becomes more compassionate and understanding of the Sioux Indians as his life intertwines with theirs with the passing of time. Renouncing his life as a US soldier, he devotes himself to the protection of his assumed people (the Sioux). The story shows levity, compassion, beauty, peace and grace, as well as dealing a little with some of the more vulgar and barbaric traits we have. It ends with a lot of questions unanswered, though it also leaves us with the understanding that those we've come to care about are alive to continue on their journey. Well worth your time… it's amazing how truly artfully delivered, mammoth movies can feel like a more traditional feature length title when they are as engaging as this is. That's what good writing will do for a movie! Watching this some 32 years after its initial release, it is also amazing how well it stands up to films of the current day",

I am not a Kevin Costner basher, he has done some work I don't care for, but this and a few others(Field of Dreams for instance) actually does show he has talent. He does do a heartfelt job directing, and his acting isn't too shabby either, in fact he gives a certain decency to Dunbar which I had difficulty not empathising with. He is very well supported by Graheme Greene and Mary McDonell who is especially brilliant. The cinematography and scenery are just magnificent, while John Barry's score is nothing short of amazing. The moving climax gives further emotional weight to an already poignant story, while the script is wholly credible and the characters feel real. In conclusion, a fine film and I had no problem with its Best Picture win. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

I had assumed when I first saw it that it was based on the experiences of some real soldier back in the civil war era. This time I could easily see it was phony and I put it on pause and looked up it's origins on the internet. This was a total work of fiction. The events in the story were also totally implausible as well as contrived and manipulative. The only impressive scene was the buffalo hunt but that was inauthentic also, as bows and arrows were not primarily used to kill the buffalos, the Indians used to drive them cliffs, wasting hundreds of buffalos for just a few. Also the story was so over stated, making the case that white people are absolute evil and the Indians are all sensitive, warm hearted saints.  So basically, that's just not respecting your audience at all.",

Which turned out to be no real surprise, as the movie is chock-full of beautiful nature scenes and massive movements of people and buffalo, because once you get past all the window dressing, the storyline is simplistic and slow-moving and the characters are mostly stereotypes.\n\nThe Sioux are the \"good\" Indians, the Pawnee, enemies of the Sioux, are the \"evil\" Indians, and the American soldiers (except for Lt. Dunbar) are all complete buffoons who make the Keystone Kops look like models of professionalism. The reality, of course, is that cruelty, violence, and imperialism were practiced not only by the white man but by Indian nations against one another. The white man won because the Indians hated each other too much to unite (and still do). But Hollywood movies rarely make genuine attempts at telling history accurately anyway.\n\nI should note that MAD Magazine, when it satirized this movie by comparing it with several others, said that none of the movies (Dances With Wolves included) were a serious depiction of the American Indian.

Despite a running time of close to three hours, the film rarely lags thanks to a compelling story and a never-ending series of beautifully shot vistas.

            "content": "Dances With Wolves is more-or-less remembered today for two things: Influencing James Cameron's masterpiece Avatar (2009) and robbing Scorsese's 'opus' and monotonous Goodfellas (1990). Unfortunately, it's impact is on a damned course; unable to go back. The shame here is that it's one of the most successful epics of the 90's. A light-hearted, but mature character observation of a man with depression find meaning among simple-like folk. The pleasure being in the somber pacing and thoughtful complexity of Costner's character. The film is arguably flawless for the most of the running time. Not only is it humorous, but it's also very witty and vast in scope. Costner plays what Cameron would incarnate with Jake Sully, and it's splendid. Costner gives brevity in the film when needed, and balances the warrior with the awkward man on self-discovery very well; insanely impressionable when deconstructed. Along with it, the depression aspect of Costner is well done, not being bogged in misery, nor brushed aside as a joke. Like Jake Sully, this mental affliction goes along with their character and how they choose their actions later on. Truthfully, the worst thing about the film is the last act, and with a film 3 hours long, the film should have been even longer! When Dances With Wolves mentions the Union soldiers coming, the film does a great job in moving the plot along to forget that face, where in Cameron's Avatar, it's something that barley escapes the mind. But when the conflict at the end does arise, it really feels forced, rushed and as if Costner was afraid of the runtime. Within the last 30 minutes of the film, it introduces the Union, makes them attack the Indians, get Costner captured, then freed and then must say goodbye to the Sioux so they can escape from the Union soldiers. Along with some minor quirks, the love story is not the most powerful or most believable- I'd say Cameron would nail it better with his film. But the love story is still sweet, along with the connection between Dances With Wolves and his companion, and the journey to him being accepted as one of them. Honestly, I love how this film plays out: A man sent to the outskirts of the U.S to hold a territory down, only to be neglected then stumble his way to the Sioux Indians and become one of them. It's that kind of of charm that's lost in modern moviemaking. But, even with this major, glaring flaw, the film ends on an emotionally satisfying note. For an epic, compared to other films, this film does not deserve the hate it gets. The direction from Costner is earnest and competent, the Cinematography from Dean Selmer is gorgeous and vast, and the entertainment: perfect. And, even with a predictable lesson of being: How the Indians, while not perfect, were a mostly peaceful people, is staple for films like these. Very few are as effectively emotional as Dances With Wolves.",

The biggest standouts here are the soundtrack and the cinematography- the latter makes the most of the beautiful, epic, and sprawling environment. Costner and the rest of the cast give solid performances, and the characters are like-able, interesting, and well realized. The pace is very slow and leisurely, especially watching the nearly four hour extended version. The slower pace does lend itself well to communicating how isolated our main character really feels. Still though, I don't feel a 3-4 hour runtime is really necessary for how sparse the story is. I think Costner could have maintained the feeling that this is an \"epic\" while cutting the runtime down to something like 2 and 1/2 hours. This would resolve the pacing issues, and still leave plenty of breathing room to become familiar with these characters and their world. I also don't know how historically accurate it is, in parts it feels very Hollywoodified and less authentic than it might be.",

            "content": "Jumping into the 90's, we ride towards another epic, this time brought to you by Kevin Costner. Dances with Wolves is about Lt. John Dunbar (Costner) who is assigned to cross into Lakota Territory to take shelter. During which, the Native Americans discover the foreign white man and they eventually team up to fight the American Union soldiers. Even though Costner's directorial debut has some magnificent cinematography, stellar performances, realistic costumes, beautiful scope, and grandiose sweeping John Barry score, the story is not as fresh as people like to call it, despite being based on a book. You know how critics and audiences compared James Cameron's Avatar to Dances with Wolves? I'd beg to differ that Wolves bears an uncanny resemblance to two lesser Western films: Run of the Arrow (1957) and A Man Called Horse (1970). Both films have the same Caucasian saviour of Sioux tribes fighting against their own kind, with Arrow being closer to Costner's film than the latter. On the other hand, what makes this one stand out could possibly be the elements I mentioned before, as well as the film's significance in bringing attention to Native American culture and Costner's directing career peak. With that said, do these make Dances with Wolves a great movie or a bad movie? Well, it's not original and at times the scenes can drag, but it's still a well-made ambitious Western epic. \n\n(4 4-Hour Over-blown Director's Cuts out of 5)",

For large parts is he alone and managing his first with only his horse and wolf as his companion. We see many glorious shots of the surroundings, the hills, the waters and the forests. The film is slow and deliberately so. It has many religious aspects from Costner's character failed attempt at suicide with god on his side with the iconic scene with his arms high,  to the Indians faith. Costner is fine in his role, I will never think of him as a great actor. The most memorable is when they chase and kill many animals. It's thrilling. The two tribes fighting is also well done and it's ironic that guns are what helps them win. Costner becoming part of the Sioux community is slow as they learn to trust him. The Sioux are shown in a good light, defending what they believe is there's but also ready against how many men are to come. The love between Costner and McDonnell does seem quick and I feel is a little skipped over before they marry. You can see at times in Costner's inexperience as a director but also what talent he has. It's interesting and intriguing to learn about new communities, I don't learn enough about Costner's character before the civil war which I would have liked to. A well made film that doesn't fully embrace on what it's trying to say.",

            "content": "This film must be one of the most audacious directorial debuts ever. To make such a glorious, breathtaking and spectacular film of this scale is hard for even a seasoned director. Costner proves that if every bit of your heart is in your work it will always shine through. The story has become known as the \"Dances with Wolves story\" and is on display in such films from Avatar to Cars, but it has never been done quite as well as we see here. Nowadays, this film would be attacked for perpetuating ‘white savior tropes', but the film is able to truly soar above pathetic labels like this. With a subject that could easily drag the film into unbearable preachy-ness, Costner is able to trade out such obnoxious manipulations for some deeply moving moments of real sincerity. His extensive care to tell the truth of the story with genuine integrity and accuracy is quite evident. The best moments of the film come when Costner shows us things that most people don't want to see. Michael Blake's screenplay is also partly responsible for this. The way that he chooses to blend Lakota and English is intriguing and gives a deeper meaning to each line depending on what tongue it is spoken in. Costner's work in front of the camera is almost equally impressive as his work in the director's chair as he whole-heartedly embodies John Dunbar with a noble sense of humanity. Mary McDonnel also does a phenomenal job in her supporting role. The most mesmerizing performance of all actually comes from the beautiful four legged canine who portrays Two-Socks. With Dean Semler's camera work, the whole film really captures the look and feel of the great cinematic western of a glorious by gone era. However, when you get down to it, the entire film BELONGS to the soul-stirring and majestic score by John Barry. It's really no use trying to describe it here so you might as well just go and listen to his theme and feel every note from head to toe for yourself. ————————Overall: With the exception of one or two scenes at the beginning that don't seem to mesh, Dances with Wolves is a richly rewarding movie experience and the best of Kevin Costner's career. ————————Highlight: The buffalo hunt sequence is one of the most awe-inspiring sites I've ever seen on camera.",

            "content": "An exhilarating and empathetic ride with Native Americans.\n\nKevin Costner's Western epic Dances with Wolves (1990) is a massive undertaking of recreating the old West in America with dozens of horses, buffalo, Native Americans, old rifles, and authentic sets and traditional costumes. Costner single-handily re-popularized the Western film genre with Dances with Wolves. Costner goes to great lengths to make the audience feel like the Native Americans are a unique and distinguished people with a rich culture, language, customs, fashion, heritage, and openness. Costner clearly revered and respected the indigenous tribes he worked with as he places them in such realistic and kindly light.\n\nDances with Wolves is primarily a Western depicting the American genocide of the Native Americans at the hands of white America. Costner's direction is sleek and engaging with Neil Travis editing down the intimidating run-time into something riveting rather than daunting. Dean Semler's cinematography captures a rustic warmth and natural scenery that makes you feel like you are right there alongside Kevin Costner. It is stellar film-making around every corner within Dances with Wolves as the sheer volume of horses, buffalo, and people that Costner organizes into captivating action sequences is impressive.\n\nI should mention that John Barry's score is so beautiful. He livens up the mood with rousing themes of excitement and unease alike. His romance theme for Dances with Wolves is iconic and the melody just takes you away to another place. Barry's musical contributions elevate Dances with Wolves to a classier level of sophistication and care for its heavy subject matter.\n\nCostner's acting is phenomenal and completely engrossing as Dances with Wolves feels closer to 2 hours than its actual 3 hour run-time thanks to Costner's sincerity. He takes the time to try and pronounce the Native American's language and names. His face reveals a deep empathy for these people and their suffering. Dances with Wolves is really a massive experiment in attempting to get American audiences to comprehend just how tragic it is that an entire people were essentially wiped out by American violence and hatred. Kevin Costner plays it cool, clumsy, and intrigued all to endear you to his awesome character Lieutenant John Dunbar, who is eventually regarded as Dances with Wolves.\n\nMary McDonnell is fascinating as the white woman raised by the Native Americans named Stands with a Fist. She has an interesting and lovely chemistry with Kevin Costner. She brings a lot of warmth to Dances with Wolves.\n\nGraham Greene is fantastic as Kicking Bird. His thoughtful and patient holy man is a wonderful kindly character. Rodney A. Grant is really interesting as Wind in His Hair as his character is filled with an understandable rage as he learns to accept a white man as his friend. Lastly among the Sioux characters, Floyd Red Crow is very fun and wise as Chief Ten Bears. You genuinely care about each of these men as you grow to understand and sympathize with them.\n\nWes Studi is fierce and intimidating as the toughest Pawnee warrior. Dances with Wolves surely led to his casting in The Last of the Mohicans and I will always appreciate that.\n\nRobert Pastorelli is funny as the grotesque Timmons. Finally, Maury Chaykin is absolutely hilarious as the disturbed drunkard Major Fambrough. These actors all culminate in Dances with Wolves' diverse and delightful cast of characters.\n\nOverall, I think Dances with Wolves earned all 7 of its Oscars and its respectable legacy. It is an endearing film that is well crafted by Kevin Coster's direction. This is especially impressive as it was his directorial debut. Dances with Wolves is classic Americana through and through.",

            "content": "If you are willing to commit nearly four hours of your life to this film, as I was, you are essentially a masochist because this film is not worth it. Yes, the cinematography was beautiful and there were a few lovely moments but overall this film was just sort of nothing as it ambled along at a remarkably slow rate. I can appreciate Kevin Costner's talents as an actor and I enjoy his presence in another extremely long film, JFK (1991), but that film used his talents correctly and is directed with the Midas touch of early 1990s Oliver Stone. I was dreading watching this film and I found that is was just as bad as I expected.\n\nJohn J. Dunbar, Kevin Costner, is a Union soldier during the Civil War. We meet him in 1863 as he is a man who struggles to find himself and requests to be posted to the Western Frontier near a settlement of Sioux tribe members. He documents his experiences in his journal and begins to contact the nearby Native Americans. Though they initially struggle with communication he is able to befriend tribe leader Kicking Bird, Graham Greene, and meet his love interest Stands with a Fist, Mary McDonnell, a white woman who was taken in by the tribe as a child after her family was murdered by the Pawnee. He is able to unite with the members of the tribe and find who he is really is as they face enemies including opposing tribes and the Union army.\n\nThe best parts of the film were the cinematography and the production values, especially when considering the fact that the film cost only $22 million to make. Dean Semler, who has worked on many Mel Gibson related films, is able to capture the picturesque open plains of the Western United States in all their natural beauty. Shots of trees and various elements of the natural environment feature prominently in scenes of conversation between various characters and this adds a brightness to the otherwise dull moments that is necessary. The film also looks expensive as everything from the costumes to the homesteads feels period appropriate. This helps you buy into the film as a ï¿ 1/2~serious' piece of work because you are not distracted by the poor sets and I applaud Costner for hiring the right people for the job.\n\nBeyond these two things there is not much else positive I can say about this film. It's twice as long as it needs to be as we get far too many montages of Costner sitting in front of fires and sweeping shots of the frontier. No real tension is built in the film as attempts are made at showing that the Native Americans are flawed and Dunbar is captured and tortured by Union soldiers at the end of the film but Costner's direction never convinces us that there is any real urgency to the proceedings. Several of the fights could have been cut down, the love scene between Dunbar and Stands with a Fist was oddly structured and I needed less time with Costner alone. Costner's voiceover seems disinterested and most of it doesn't tell us much about the character, especially when considering that Goodfellas (1990) contains some of the best use of voiceover I have ever seen. All of these issues, mostly the length, caused watching the film to be a profoundly dull experience as it never amazed me in the way that Ben-Hur (1959), another similarly long film, did.\n\nThis is a film that is objectively not as good as Goodfellas, a long film that zips by at an alarming pace as it is informative and enjoyable. Everything that Goodfellas does with grace and care, Dances with Wolves seemingly can't get a handle on. I understood who Henry Hill was in just a few minutes through his opening monologue where I spent 4 hours finding out about a fairly dull soldier in this film. If the Academy had given Scorsese Best Picture and Best Director in this year they would have been doing the right thing and we wouldn't have to think about The Departed (2006) being the only he film he's directed to earn the big one. This is not a film that's worth your time, if you want a good Best Picture winning Western watch the much shorter Unforgiven (1992).",

I knew that it was another interpretation of the same kind of story as Pocahontas or Fern Gully, and I got frustrated with Avatar for being so derivative because it recycled this storyline again. What Dances with Wolves proved to me is that it was not the familiar story that made Avatar disappointing, but the way it was told. This movie is magical. I was taken on a journey with Kevin Costner’s character that was so wonderful. Seeing the gradual development from his first contact to his eventual kinship with the Native Americans was authentic and heartwarming. Nothing about it felt false or unearned. It’s a marvel how a movie like this can manipulate my own perception, without coming out and saying anything. Over time I started to see the white men as a dangerous threat that I was dreading, which is a marvelous feat for a movie to accomplish considering I am a white man. There are so many scenes that are stuck in my head from Dances with Wolves. The story has a number of great highlights, including some intense action sequences that I imagine were a major challenge to film. The cinematography was gorgeous throughout, and did a lot to highlight the beauty of the region. Also the score from John Barry is perfect. I was so enthralled with the film that I was astounded when I saw the time after it ended, because it never felt long, in fact it raced by in no time. If anything I felt there were a few moments that were accelerated a bit too much in the final act, and my one complaint would be the coincidental arrival time of white men as the movie approaches conclusion. That being said, the movie was superb in all other ways, so I hardly noticed any of that. I wish the ending could have gone a little different, but it would have lacked historical accuracy, so the conclusion was exactly what it needed to be. Dances with Wolves is a brilliant film and one I can’t wait to watch again.

The chemistry and the relationship that is built-up among the characters is depicted form the scratch that helps the viewers too connect with the feature; a slick move by the makers. \n\nIt is rich on technical aspects like costume design, sound department, background score, cinematography and editing. It is shot beautifully and the camera work is charming and makes it immensely pleasing to encounter with great locations and visuals. The writing is strong especially on character's perspective that is judged, accounted and balanced upon nicely. \n\nThe adaptation by Michael Blake of his own novel, is smart and gripping and the primary reason why it works is his awareness of the characters image and the palpable environment offered to it, since the beginning. Kevin Costner; the director, is surprisingly good considering that it is his first project, as it shows a lot of potential since such character driven feature can easily come off as a dull and over-chewing feature if not executed accordingly. Kevin Costner as the protagonist is convincing in his performance along with his supporting cast like Marry McDonnell and Graham Greene. \n\nDance With Wolves is a rhythmic beat that values its culture and rituals that binds it all to create something colossal out of a mere gesture.",

The cinematic release is 3 hours long, I seen the 4 hours extended cut. For me, if you've made a movie which is 3 hours long and there's still things you need to include, something has gone wrong somewhere along the line. Many scenes, particularly the nature porn ones, could be trimmed down and some scenes could be omitted altogether. Some last less than 2 minutes and don't serve any purpose at all in terms of narrative or character. Kevin Costner has never been a famously good actor, and while this might be his best role, sometimes his notoriously stony-faced demeanour and band line deliveries make it hard to buy some of the more emotional moments. His uncertain bond with the Sioux Indians is the most interesting element, becoming more mundane and routine once he actually ingratiates himself with them. It's nowhere near as tooth-grindingly dull as Terrence Mallick's The New World, another film which is at its most engaging when the characters are in a state of uncertainty, but lets things drag on for too long. It's definitely worth a single sitting at least, since its themes of intolerance, man in nature and the destruction of an entire way of life will never not be relevant or important. But due to its slow pacing and excessive runtime, it's never something you could watch frequently.",

However, our hero escapes and goes toward doing what is right. The social commentary of the film surrounds the idea of death of self as a rebirth. He is a man who was living and being apart of the wrong side but he escapes by some Spiritual grace and is transformed. After being taken in by the Sioux tribe he sees that what has happened is not a coincidence and strives to overcome conflict and find his path. The movie is elegantly shot and some of the views are breathtakingly colorful. The soundtrack adds depth and pace and makes the shorter seems as well as the longer ones more enthralling. By the time the movie revolves we see the archetype of the \"rebirth\" as Costner is completely transformed and his moral standing is honored by the Sioux peoples as well as those fighting for the Union. It was a slow burn and by that I mean it took a while for it to develop but when it did, boy was it good. I would highly recommend this film and I think that I gained a greater appreciation to natural lighting and nature shots after seeing this film.

            "content": "As a movie that I grew up with, it's hard not to love this one. Looking back it's pretty old school, but stands up fine today, with a great story.  Acting is typical for the time, yet good, the script is good and makes their language barrier believable and convincing.  The story is the strong point here, the lone soldier, who had tried to kill himself in the line of battle, by himself in a hostile territory who makes friends with a tribe of Indians who live on the land.  It is primarily a dark story in my opinion, shows the worst of people and their beliefs, and how different yet similar these two peoples are.  Cruel and violent, they way they all were at the time, and almost hard to watch at times.  Can be pretty dark and gruesome for a PG rated movie, even if it doesn't show much we know exactly what their doing. For example the Indians killing the man who drove the cart that John rode to the fort, which I remember from the first time I watched it.  The action is good, for the time is western in style for sure, but well done with hand held weapons and old rifles.  Looks good and sounds good.  What really sticks out is the killer instincts of the Indians and how they love to kill, in an evil and ruthless way, they way they have been portrayed forever.  The soldiers too don't show compassion, but get slaughtered when they come against the Indians. Overall good movie for sure, long as hell and not super fasted paced, but interesting and well done.",

They need to be re-watched.  They're worth it.\n\nThis time; Dances with Wolves, brought to us by a very wise and brilliant young actor (at that time) called Kevin Costner (you've probably heard of him!)\n\nNB: This was what turned Kevin Costner into gold dust for a few years (remember Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves).  Costner was King Midas basically until his sparkly, shiny star reached its apogee with his untimely filmic demise in the utterly ridiculous and overblown (and over-budget) Waterworld. (Holds head in hands; Kevin what were you thinking!)\n\nI fell in love with Dances With Wolves in 1990 and then recently again when I tried to force my 13 and 15 year old to watch it.  Their response was the inauspicious; \"It's a bit boring dad,\" as they vacated the sofa 32 minutes in.  But I contend here Calum and Adam that you're just not quite ready for it yet and don't be surprised if it cycles round again sneakily one Friday Family Film Night soon.  \n\nDances With Wolves is genius, a slim novel of 1988 vintage written by Michael Blake with his eyes on a possible screenplay prize, it was bought hook, line and sinker by Costner who yummed it up so much he starred, directed and drummed up the finance for it over the next few years.  It became Costner's labour of love and at the same time he re-invented the Western form for Hollywood so they could fall in love with it again in a post-modern way with a whole lot less stubble and a whole lot more human heart.\n\nDances With Wolves has Oscar written all over it and I fell head over in heels in love with it when I was a (still extremely naive and immature) twenty-two year old.  Where to start then on this gorgeous-fest of love, hope, humanity and sheer cinematographical brilliance?\n\nIs it with Timmons the hapless mule-train driver who first takes the naive and idealistic John Dunbar (the solider fresh from the horrors of the Civil War) that Costner plays out to the Frontier, a sea of prairie where so-called civilisation hasn't reached yet?    (Poor Timmons dies brutally - and brilliantly - the victim of some Pawnee Indians tracking back to their home-lands after a patrol.  His scalping is so visceral we can almost hear (at an appropriate distance) the skin unzipping from the skull!)\n\nOr perhaps we should start with Kicking Bird (played by Graham Greene) the thoughtful and wise young brave who first visits the decimated Fort Sedgwick after John Dunbar first arrives.\n\nOr perhaps it is simply the vast, swaying grasslands of the mid-west, an ocean of Buffalo for mile upon mile?  A landscape the sky was invented for, a landscape to put us in our mortal place.\n\nOr perhaps it's the sweeping John Barry soundtrack or incredible long, lugubrious shoots of the Dakota Badlands and the in-your-face wildernesss of a country as yet untamed.\n\nAt root the reason why so many of us love this film is the production values for the whole project, from cinematography through to the language coaching the Native American actors underwent so they spoke Lakota convincingly.  Everything on this movie is sumptuous (except perhaps the budget, note to self Mr Costner) and it is strong and powerful theme of the story, revisited endlessly in mini-echoes throughout its three hour duration, that brings home such a resounding narrative success.  Dances With Wolves works because the story is simple and straight as a Pawnee arrow and it strikes right to our hearts.  It is about what we truly are, as individuals and as a species.  It is about heart and head, family, connections and the wisdom of living together with tolerance and in harmony with our world.  It is about the wind in our hair and the sun on our backs, it is about simply being as opposed to being something.\n\nThe story is a back-to-nature tale of John Dunbar's gradual re-education about the so-called Savages the great White Man is expunging from America's heartland.  It is an Alice Through The Looking Glass narrative where Dunbar very soon realises, whilst amongst the metaphorical wolves of the title, it is his own kind, White Man, who are the savages.  The story of this film was totally ripped off in Avatar, same idea, just with eleven foot smurf aliens and some eye-popping CGI.  What Dances With Wolves has in spades which its newer and bluer rip off didn't (and I totally loved Avatar too) is that it helped reinforce a revisionist tack on the Great American West, actually much more like genocide than a heap of swaggering John Wayne gunslingers ever let on. \n\n Of course the Native American life-style is romanticized in this film, the wars between tribes, the pointless politics and the diseases and famines of a neolithic society are all glossed over, but we can forgive all that.  It's ultimately an extended apology for all the Cowboy and Indians nonsense that went gone before.  The Wild in West was the White Man's rapacious and violent land-grab and in Dances With Wolves we get to see that barbarism from the other end of the telescope.  Not pretty or pleasant, but a truer account than most Westerns.\n\nGo on, buy it again and re-watch it.  It deepens our humanity and succeeds in upsetting me deeply every single time I watch it.\n\n***** (Five Stars)",

            "content": "It took me long enough to see an above average films with Kevin Costner. Dances with Wolves is the first film in my Kevin Costner marathon. This is a fairly simple film. It revolves around John Dunbar, a lieutenant in the civil war who is injured and is sent to his own outpost. He goes on to make friends with a near by indian tribe.\nNow Dances with Wolves is not a bad film. Many people give it a bad rap because it beat out Goodfellas for best picture and director at the Academy Awards. Even though I don't agree with their decision I can admit that this is a very good film, but has its faults.\nLet's start of with good. Kevin Costner and the rest of the cast are absolutely phenomenal. As a director, Costner depicts a detailed look at America's past, while making the audience feel for everyone from the indian leader to Costner's horse. It is pretty impressive that this film was only made on a $22 million dollar budget. The costume design, set pieces, and make up were absolutely fantastic. Also, the cinematography throughout the whole film is out of this world.\nNow the bad. This film has lots of corny moments to it. The dialogue between the indians and Costner is one-dimensional a lot of the times, especially towards the beginning of the film. The theatrical cut clocks in at a little over three hours. It does not need to be this long. A lot of scenes throughout the film feel as though they have been seen many times throughout the course of the film. It could've easily of been shaved down to two and a half hours. Many of the events in the film fall into place a little too coincidentally.\nEven though Dances with Wolves has its faults it is definitely worth a watch. It shows that Costner was incredibly passionate about this film and is incredibly capable of making a good film. If you are interested or a fan of the time period you will enjoy this film even more.",

            "content": "A sweeping, powerful epic in the truest sense of the genre's definition, \"Dances With Wolves\" wears its heart on its sleeve and is so earnest that only the most cynical and hardened of hearts would refuse to be carried along in its grasp. Tackling some heavy issues of the American Frontier, the film is commendable for powerfully portraying the Native American's plight without ever romanticizing them. The portrayal is humanizing and powerful. Kevin Costner's turn as Lt. Dunbar/Dances With Wolves is powerful, perfectly capturing a earnest, innocent American spirit who finds much to admire, and fear, in the native Sioux. The cinematography, however, may steal the show from all else. Every two minutes it seems yet another majestic and striking image appears on screen that will be etched in your mind. Take the buffalo hunting scene for example, a first rate sequence that speaks to the near spiritual power of cinema done right. The film, for a four hour epic in its extended cut, is remarkably well paced, never boring or tiring. The cast is often funny and charming, avoiding the tendency of some epics to become overly dour. Occasionally this crosses over into sappiness (overwrought kissing, heavy-handed thematic exploration) but these are minor quibbles. Like all the greatest epics, \"Dances With Wolves\" is less a story and more an experience, a Romantic poem to a lost time. Makes a fascinating companion piece for Zwick's later \"The Last Samurai\" and earns a spot right up on the top tier of historical epics. A must see at least once.",

            "content": "Well, it's not a bad movie, but I didn't really buy into the hype about \"Dances with Wolves\". It could be entertaining, but it could have been more so. It was decently acted, but it could have had a better draw. Diving right into the story, it follows Lt. John Dunbar, a Civil War soldier who goes on an adventure in the deserted wilderness inhabited by Sioux Indians. When they first meet, there is hostility, of course, over race-related issues. The indians fear that the white man is coming and Dunbar warns them about it. All while being welcomed into their tribe, falling in love with a white woman known as Stands with a Fist, and developing a relationship with nature.\n\nAll right, a couple of problems right off the bat. This story is absolutely nothing new, I've seen it before. Hollywood's inability to tell a fleshed out well-developed story revolving around race is surprising. It's always the innocent tribe and the greedy white man wanting to take over. There's no real explanation to this, only because they look different they are natural enemies. I'm sure actual historical accounts of this had a deeper meaning, but like other films that do this, it's just \"They look different, so we don't like them\". Second, Costner isn't bad, but his character isn't really that interesting. I'll get to the positives later, but he just seems sort of bland and a big chunk of the movie is just hearing him write in his diary with not so memorable lines. The third thing I want to bring up is that the film is much too long. And it's rare that I say that because it's just how movies work. It takes a while for the plot, scenery, and characters to fully come into place while also being entertaining. But is there really any need to make this 3 hours long? It's a pretty simple story with most of the characters not having that much intrigue, it could have been at least a little shorter. On top of that, it really had nothing to do with the Civil War, which to me was a disappointment.\nNow onto the positive aspects, one character that is interesting is Stands With a Fist. The film should really be about her, she's the one with a tragic back story of losing her family and being raised by the tribe. And her existing in the Sioux world creates more drama between the two opposing sides. She's more interesting than the typical pretty girl love interest that is usually in these movies. Next, when the story does revolve around the survival of the Sioux tribe, it gets to be interesting. The scene in particular when they hunt the buffalo is fun to watch, and the insight to a lot of the other cultural rituals they have can look great too. Another notable scene is where Dunbar, or Dances with Wolves, dances around the fire earning him his nickname as the wolf Twosocks comes up. That's one symbolism I got into was his relationship with the wolf, which did point back to the rivalry that the film was about in symbolizing how best to handle the enemy. But those scenes were still entertaining.\nIt's not great, it's not terrible, it's just okay. I just really wanted to like this film more than I did, and for me it was kind of a mixed bag.",

            "content": "While it's not the shortest movie, Dances with Wolves proved itself to be pretty interesting.  Although it did not hold the Civil War as a main topic of the movie, it did focus on the Native Americans and their thoughts on the 'white men'.  Because the Civil War was only in the background, many war components were not mentioned.  While sporting some truth, this movie does contain a number of inaccuracies; however, most of them are minor.  Overall, Dances with Wolves is a good movie for those who are interested in history, but aren't as interested in war movies. \nDances with Wolves begins in 1863, in the middle of the Civil War.  John Dunbar, a Union soldier, has been sent to a military outpost in the west.  When he arrives, he finds that he is the only one stationed in this area.  Keeping notes in his journal every day, Dunbar settles himself into the outpost.  Eventually, Dunbar comes in contact with a tribe of Sioux Indians.  At first, conversation proves to be difficult, because they do not speak the same language, but after a while Dunbar and the medicine man, Kicking Bird, figure out a way to communicate with each other.\nWith a growing friendship, Dunbar introduces northern machinery to the Indians.  He shows them how to grind coffee and even teaches them about sugar and shows them how to add it to the coffee.  The Indians are beginning to accept Dunbar, and when he meets Stands with a Fist, a white woman who became part of the Indian tribe at a young age, she tries to remember how to speak in English and acts as a translator for Dunbar and the Indians.  \nDunbar and the Indians take a day to hunt buffalo, which the Indians depend on for food.  By helping the Indians kill the buffalo, Dunbar only bettered his relationship with the tribe.  The soldier also proved himself to the tribe when an invading tribe attacked.   He helped to defend the Indians that were now his close friends. \nAfter spending time with Stands with a Fist, Dunbar realizes love has come upon him, and the relationship that he has with her grows as well.  John Dunbar, renamed Dances with Wolves by the Sioux tribe, undergoes a lot of self-discovery throughout the movie.  He discovers who he really is and what is truly important in life. \nThe Civil War was more of a background event in this movie.  The beginning featured some brief battle scenes.  The slow battles took me by surprise.  Whenever I pictured war, I always imagined rapid fire and outrageous violence.  However, with the weapon technology that was around at the time, this was not possible.  \nMany things were not addressed in this movie such as slavery, abolitionist campaigns, and the Southern military or political compromises.  The North's industrial power can be seen when Dunbar showed the Indians how to grind coffee.   Also, in the beginning of the movie when a trading post was shown with machinery.  While talking, the Indians displayed their knowledge of expansion.  They discussed the threat of the 'white men' that they knew would soon be coming to their land.  \nEven though Dances with Wolves can be considered entertaining, it did have some faults.  For example: in reality, the medicine man, Kicking Bird, was not a medicine man at all.  Instead, he took the role as chief in a completely different tribe by the name of the Kiowa.  The winter campaign by the United States Army in search of Dances with Wolves and the Indians can be considered another inaccuracy.  The campaign depicted in the movie supposedly occurred in 1864; however, no winter campaigns actually launched until the winter of 1868.   Besides the inaccuracies, the movie also contained some correct information, such as the use of the coffee grinder.  In 1798, the first coffee grinder patent went to Thomas Bruff.   Stands with a Fist being captured by the Indians can also be counted as a measure of accuracy.  The Plains Indians would often steal children in order to ensure survival of their group and to keep their population levels up. \nInitially, I was very against the idea of having to watch a Civil War movie.  I complained about it a lot before I started watching it and for the first few minutes of the movie I was just really unhappy.  However, during the movie, I actually found myself enjoying it a lot more than I thought I would.  I was under the impression that the movie would have a lot of war talk and battle scenes, which I don't find very interesting, but this movie was more about the friendship and relationships between a Union soldier and a Sioux Indian tribe.  In the end, I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I would.  I even recommended Dances with Wolves to my friends that had not picked a movie for their project yet.  I would recommend this movie for people that are not really interested in the fighting aspects of the Civil War.",

It's still a movie with well-directed scenes and very good performances. One of the best, if not the best movie that Kevin Costner has been a part of. His passion for the story shows and he tells it in a way that keeps you interested. I appreciated what the movie had to say and think it is well-worth your time.",

            "content": "Dances With Wolves is an epic that aims almost exclusively for the heartstrings while also leaving a little for the brain to chew on.  And the film hits the bullseye.  We come to really connect and care about Dunbar and the Sioux tribe so much that the climax has us celebrating them for killing American soldiers.  It's all high emotional drama punctuated with appropriate moments of comedy, or at the very least, amusing interactions.\nCostner, as star and director, paints a vivid picture of nobility, family, humility and humanity against the backdrop of the vast, empty plains of the midwest.  Graham Greene is at his best here.  This is the film that imprinted his face on my memory so that I would recognize him in every subsequent role I saw him.  Unforunately, Wes Studi felt underutilized as the leader of the Pawnee tribe.  Mary McDonnell was also great.  I was impressed how well she looked and sounded like a woman who had assimilated so deeply into the Sioux culture that she had to struggle to remember how to speak her native language.\nOne other interesting point I noted about Dances With Wolves is how mental illness seems to figure in to the story, at least in the beginning.  Dunbar starts out suicidal, then moves to the plains to seek solitude.  Along the way, he encounters an officer who styles himself a monarch, soils himself, then kills himself.  The wagon driver who takes Dunbar to his post at Fort Sedgwick is also half-crazy, and the soldiers at the Fort  abandon it in some sort of state of melancholy or something.  These events happen in the first half of the film and are nearly forgotten about by the time Dunbar encounters the Sioux.  I don't know if any of the apparent mental illness actually means anything to the movie, but I thought it should be noted.",

The enormous amount of time, money, effort, and attention to detail pays off in the intense drama of near true-to-life characters.

            "content": "The opening scene of Dances with Wolves seemed fairly brutal in terms of witnessing Kevin Costner suffer as he attempted to put his boots on. That, combined with the magnificent musical score and cinematography instantly set the atmosphere and the scale of the story to be the epic that I was expecting, and what I received as a viewer was a Western version of Lawrence of Arabia.\nThat's a fairly big call, considering Lawrence of Arabia has been named the greatest film epic of all time as well as one if the greatest films of all time, but the Academy clearly agrees with me as they honoured Dances with Wolves with a deserving Academy Award for Best Picture, amidst another 6.\n\nThe simple fact is that before Kevin Costner became famously branded a sellout for his films Waterworld, The Postman and Dragonfly and becoming a running joke on Family Guy, he served as the mastermind behind this western epic, one of the finest westerns I have ever seen.\nKevin Costner put undying faith into Dances with Wolves, including $3 Million of his own to ensure he could hold on to the vision he wanted, even though it resulted in people dubbing the production \"Kevin's Gate\" in reference to Heaven's Gate, an industry changing western epic failure. But his spirit shines on through this magnificent film which he handled himself with utterly excellent direction, direction worth nothing short of an Academy Award. He makes sure that Dances with Wolves is a compelling story and that the atmosphere thrives with the development of its lead character Lt. John J. Dunbar / Dances with Wolves, which he does so through an excellent performance which characterises him finely as the two characters he is. He portrays dedicated Lieutenant full of charisma for the first part of the film, and he later develops into an honourary Naive American with more determination and connection to nature than he could have ever wished for as a Lieutenant. The development is astounding, and the performance truly is Kevin Costner's finest hour. Kevin Costner did more for Dances with Wolves than anyone could have predicted, and without him there is no telling what imperfect film it could have been.\n\nOne reason that Dances with wolves is the utter success it is can be attributed to the magnificent story. It begins as a heroic tale of a man who loved his country so much that he nearly gave his life away in a desperate plot to help it, develops into a story about a man who wants to see the beautiful side if his country only visible through the outskirts of nature, and later develops into one about him becoming a dedicated friend of the Native American community. The story is heroic and has a beautiful theme in its look at the natural world, as well as the sense of fear that comes with it in the particular setting it makes use of.\nThe way that Dances with Wolves puts nature into perspective with the beautiful locations its filmed on with magnificent cinematography, and the entire viewing experience is just absolutely exhilarating. \nAnd the story is scripted very finely with plenty of insight into the mind of Lt. John J. Dunbar as he discusses feeling stranded and his connection to nature, as well as what goes on in his head as he transitions into Dances with Wolves. It also provides a fair look at Native American culture and their customs, without the burden of one sidedness found in many John Wayne westerns. Dances with Wolves actually supports the Indians and deals with their stereotypes of the positive and negative manner, as well as teaching that generalisation of stereotypes must be wider, considering there are many tribes with many customs, some are violent and some are peaceful. Dances with Wolves provides a deeper look into the peaceful side, and it conveys what is essentially a magic culture in such a beautiful manner. And the story flows perfectly, because its paced slowly in a peaceful sense as never to feel rushed. It doesn't fall to a boringly slow pace because the entire time, the movie had me embalmed in the story. It was just rich with humanity.\nAnd Graham Greene gave a performance so deep in his character that I was in disbelief to find out that he was Canadian, not Native American. He was so dedicated to his character and decorated by Academy Award worthy Production Design, Costumes and Makeup that his performance had high standards which it lived up to with flying colours.\nAnd with Mary McDonnell as Stands with a Fist, serving as a character born Caucasian and raised Native American, she serves as a character providing a sense of inner conflict and conveys excellent chemistry with Kevin Costner. Her character just seems real, and her performance is terrific.\n\nSo for its incredible true story, Magnificent musical score and excellent effort by Kevin Costner in his answer to Citizen Kane, Dances with Wolves is one of the greatest films I've ever seen and my 2nd favourite Western, behind Django Unchained.",

One of its greatest strengths is its even handed portrayal of both sides of what was a gruesome bigotry ridden fight for land, opportunity, and way of life, between two very different cultures in the late 1800's.  The Civil Wars' leftovers were a maliciously violent and frighteningly ignorant bunch, pit them against a culture of genuinely primitive & savage people (scalping & yelping pridefully about it - wow) and you have a perfect breeding ground for intolerance, impetuous violence, and never ending retaliatory fighting.  \"Dances with Wolves\" provides a context for understanding both sides' humanity (for better and for worse) concerning this scar on our nation's history.  Said understanding is permitted through an engaging story told on a stunning backdrop of our disappearing plains and enriched with beautifully moving music.  In 2007, \"Dances with Wolves\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"  It may drive home the meaning of being human more than any other film I've ever seen.

            "content": "A film that manages to combine deep and meaningful character study with exotic locations and the feel of an adventure. Dances with Wolves is one of those rare films where time becomes transcendent and you're no longer able to perceive the usual story arcs or acts. They're there and the film has a rock-solid foundation, but you're still surprised when something new happens, because the film has managed to lull you into its world, its prolonged seasons. This is a movie that is able to portray the passage of time properly. It's a film in which events don't take place over a weekend or even a month. Rather whole years just glide by. Or perhaps just months, it's impossible to say for sure, but it feels like years, a sizable chunk of a whole life.\n\nAnd what a life that is and what a person living it. Lieutenant Dunbar - masterfully played by Kevin Costner - is a war hero given a dead end assignment according to his wishes, so that he can resign there to die a slow death. Thus the film starts as a macabre portrayal of a man giving up, but unable to just lay down. And it never becomes clear whether he manages to shake that initial attitude towards life. The events slowly give him more reasons to live, but Costner always plays him slightly detached, like he's always just one step away from giving up again. It's an amazing story and one that requires space to flourish. Quite many films since this one have managed to recreate the same \"going native\" storyline, which of course existed before this film though never quite like this, but none of them have seemed to realize that the film needs to dedicate most of its running time to the actual \"going\". Because that's the story, that's the attraction. The action scenes and battles have their place, but the magic is in the community, in the bonds that slowly grow between the main character and the natives.\n\nIt's very hard to find any flaws in this film. Its slow pace is not for everyone, especially in the extended cut, but I personally never complained or even noticed the hours. It's a captivating film from start to finish and every minute is well spent, be it a minute of quiet landscapes rolling by or a minute of blazing battle. All has its place and every scene tells a story, reveals another layer.\n\nOne of the greatest westerns ever filmed, if not one of the greatest films. In my opinion a film that everyone should watch at least once.",

He gives a good acting performance, maybe his best, but I think many actors would maybe have delved deeper into the character.

The time frame is a day to day basis and dosen't skip any periods of time.\nThe film has a lot of wide and long shots to show the beauty of the land, this is emphasized because this is what Americans were fighting for.\nCmmunication is a key component, Dunbar appears to have seriously great communication skills. He can communicate with his horse, the wolve and obviously the Indians.\nDunbar is an amazing character because he's very open minded . From doing the craazy suicidal stunt to taking a women back down to the indians, it seems Dunbar is not afraid of death.\nWhat i love about this film is that it breaks historys own conception. When we see school text books showing the wars and stereotypes and films are visually better for me to see history and real life human beings play History out scewed or unscewed.\nI would recommend this film for one who loves history and films ivolving loyalty, friendship and love, Yes the film does have it scenes where it slows in momentum but most movies do, especially at over 3 hour.",

            "content": "Alright so finally we reach my 400th review: Dances with Wolves. I decided to go with this one for 400 because when I reach some in the hundreds, I want my review to be on a film that's either a big deal at that time or one that have a personal meaning to me. So like when I made Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King and Atlantis: The Lost Empire my 100th and 200th reviews respectively, I did that because they were among my favorite films of all time. And when I made The Dark Knight Rises my 300th review, it had just hit the theaters at the time and it was such a big highly anticipated film. This falls into a personal meaning because according to my parents, this actually is the first film I've ever seen in my life. Like their basic story was that they brought their three months old into the theater and the three month old got into watching it as it played. I know it sounds silly and it probably isn't much of a reason to count as the first film I ever saw, but all the same I find this a big enough deal to eventually be one of my bigger reviews. So here at long last is my 400th film review: Dances with Wolves.\r\n\r\nPlot: First Lieutenant John Dunbar is transferred to the western frontier after helping the Union army of a battle against the confederates. When he gets to his post, Fort Sedgwick, he finds it abandoned and in disrepair, but he decides to repair it and enjoy a simple quite life manning the fort by himself. But then he encounters a village of Sioux Native Americans living near the fort and begins to become fascinated with their lifestyle and customs while trying to form a friendship with them.\r\n\r\nNow for quite a while, I've heard people say that this film winning best picture was a big screw up for the Academy Awards because everyone felt that Goodfellas should've won without a doubt. Now I've only seen a little more then half of Goodfellas, but from what I've seen, sure, it look like a really good fun film. But does that make this film the worst film to win if not Goodfellas? No. I honestly find it to be a really well done film. It has a really nice story, likable characters, I liked how it was very slow-paced even if it might've dragged a tiny bit, Kevin Costner did a great job as John Dunbar/Dances with Wolves, I find it really impressive that he also directed this movie on top of acting in it, and it has a really good message about the life of the Native Americans at that time. In fact I can agree that despite being a good film, Dances with Wolves really won just because of its political statement. I wish that wasn't really true, but ultimately it is. But I think that even through that's the case it's still does a great job at displaying who these people are and about their language, culture, traditions and so on. And having not seen the other nominees from that year aside from The Godfather Part III (you know, that one movie that doesn't exist...) The only other real problem that comes to mind when I was watching this film is that some people might not like it since Avatar pretty much took its story. But if some people feel that way, I'll argue that what makes this film better is that it has more of a historical and educational value and that they use it very well with primarily their characters rather then the visual effects. So with that said, I'd like to think you can enjoy it anyway whether you basically know the story already because of Avatar or not.\r\n\r\nAnd that's my review for Dances with Wolves. It may have wrongly won best picture because of its political statement, but I for one still think it's an enjoyable movie that has a good story, good characters that gives us some very well displayed historical value. It most likely shouldn't have won, but at least it was hardly the worst movie to win best picture. So now I have finally reached 400 reviews. I want to say thank you for reading my reviews and also thank you again that thanks to all of you, my blog has reached a total of more then 10,000 views. I plan to have the next 100 reviews to finish my little quest of watching and reviewing all the best picture winners along with a few franchises an things like that, that I haven't touched yet. Until then, yay that I have now reached 400 and here's to eventually one day reaching 500!",

The storyline isn't even that fresh, it's actually a reworking of the Pocahontas story. I also think it's too long and not as well acted as it could of been. It won Best Picture and a whole bunch of other Oscars in 1990 instead of ''Goodfellas,'' one of the greatest films ever made, which I know shouldn't count as criticism, but I can't help it.

            "content": "DANCES WITH WOLVES was Kevin Costner's directorial debut, and what a debut it was. It's not just an epic in terms of length, but also in terms of the themes of love, adventure and cultural exchange which it addresses. It is a richly detailed portrayal of one man's enlightenment and transformation that should cut to the heart of anyone who watches it. Kevin Costner plays Lieutenant John J. Dunbar, wounded during the Civil War in Tennessee and, at his request, transferred to the frontier. When he arrives there, he finds his post deserted. While there, he eventually meets the Lakota Sioux and strikes up a friendship with them that develops over the course of the film. One thing (among many) that this film does right is portray Native Americans in a more sympathetic light compared to film portrayals in the past. Here they aren't \"noble savages,\" but people just living off the land who have a rich culture and history. The Pawnee aren't portrayed as kindly, but in the context of the film this is ok as they are enemies of the Sioux. This leads to the bigger issue of American imperialism and the Monroe Doctrine which, while never directly addressed as such, was a major source of tension between the US and Indian tribes in the 19th century. Yes, we stole land that they had been living on for generations and the film is bold enough to admit that. Aside from issues, DANCES WITH WOLVES manages to just tell a good story with richly detailed characters that has dramatic heft and palpable emotional impact. There are a number of sequences which display Costner's eye for good cinema and show a firm directorial hand at work. One such sequence takes place about halfway through and shows Dunbar and the Sioux hunting a herd of buffalo on the plain. There are also a few battle sequences which are brilliantly filmed. The only minor complaints I have are that the US soldiers towards the end are portrayed as villains in a somewhat cartoonish way. While certainly not saints, I feel like they were portrayed that way on purpose so as to make the Native Americans look that much more like the heroes. I can see why this was done, but I don't feel like it was entirely necessary to vilify them in such a broad way. I also think that despite the importance of the events that the film portrays, and the way in which it portrays them, that in the end it's merely a crowd-pleasing epic. Nothing truly profound is said about the human condition and our relationships with one another, as seems to be the film's intention. It has the slight air of being a cinematic apology: a rather sincere one, but still a little pretentious. I'm not quite sure if this film deserved to win Best Picture in 1991, as there were a lot of strong contenders that year, but it certainly was a high point for Kevin Costner's career and is definitely worth seeing.",

            "content": "oscarclub.wordpress.com\r\n\r\nBeautiful, historical, watchable, soulful, this film is a true Best Picture winner. It's not often you get a great story with brilliant storytelling skills, especially from a first time director. With minimal dialogue, Director, Kevin Costner and the gang used music, images and space in such a simple way... it was breathtakingly beautiful. \r\n\r\nIt begins in 1863 when the American Civil War is raging. Injured First Lieutenant John Dunbar (Costner) escapes the incompetent field surgery, choosing his own fate. He ends up doing something brave and, in return, he is offered any post he likes. He chooses to go West and ends up at the abandoned Fort Sedgwick.\r\n\r\nIn this lonely land, his only friends are his horse and a slightly wild wolf that visits him every day. Soon he encounters a Sioux tribe and decides to befriend them. He finds a Sioux woman, Stands With A Fist (McDonnell), bleeding and returns her to her tribe. Friendship is soon established with Kicking Bird (Greene). It is revealed that Stands With A Fist is actually a white woman who was rescued after her family was attacked by the Pawnee when she was a kid.\r\n\r\nThen there's buffalo, battles, gross stuff, love and snow. The plot rocks so I won't ruin it for you if you haven't seen this masterpiece.\r\n\r\nMonotonal Costner was born to play this part. He's a much better actor when he's not talking so this was a perfect role for him. McDonnell gave a convincing performance as the Sioux convert. Her translation of Sioux into English was convincing and that hair! Don't get me started on the hair. \r\n\r\nThe stars would have to be the Native American actors in the beautiful Sioux community. None of the performances were awkward or forced. It just seemed real. Grahame Greene, Rodney A. Grant and Nathan Lee Chasing His Horse (and of course many others) portrayed a noble peaceful people, threatened by the influx of white people. In comparison, caucasian people appeared rough and cold hearted, blood thirsty and ignorant. \r\n\r\nI cannot rave enough about this film. Though it is long, it is so watchable. I can't wait to see the 4 hour version. It is disturbing but not devastating. It is soulful but not sappy. It is minimalist but not boring. It harks back to the Gone With the Wind films without the melodrama. \r\n\r\nIt is simply a masterpiece and if you haven't seen it yet, shame on you! \r\n\r\n'Dances With Wolves' Trivia:\r\n\r\n* Budget - $22 million (worth every cent I tell ya!)\r\n* It took only 4 months to film but they experienced delays due to unpredictable weather in South Dakota\r\n* The buffalo scene had not CGI. There were very few animatronics. Most were real buffalo, during a real stampede. \r\n* Costner was thrown off his horse during the stampede and almost broke his back\r\n* The Sioux language has male/female gendered and the Sioux expert on the set was a woman, which meant that Costner was speaking female Sioux instead of male.\r\n* Water was brought in to fill up the pond as there was a drought on the Fort Sedgwick location\r\n* One of the wolves actually bit the trainer in the scene where Two Socks is being told to go home. When Costner is running away from him, he had to throw meat to the animal to keep him from nipping him too.\r\n* The buffalo in the charging scene was actually running towards a pile of his favourite snack, Oreo Cookies. Go figure!\r\n* With the film over budget, Costner had to kick in $3 million of his own money. But the film was so successful, he earned $40 million in return. A sound investment indeed.\r\n* Costner's 6 year old daughter plays the young Stands With a Fist\r\n* McDonnell asked for the love scenes to be tamed down, as she wasn't comfortable making tha lurve as explicitly as the script suggested",

            "content": "It may be a clichéd complaint, but more often than not the Academy has got the Best Picture Oscar dead wrong. Sometimes, as with Crash, their mistake is obvious and the outcry is instant; on other occasions, as with Citizen Kane, both the Academy and the public have taken time to see the error of their ways. And then we have Dances with Wolves, which beat Goodfellas to the big gong to deny Martin Scorsese his Oscar for a third time. While not as crass a mistake as the others, time has not been kind to Kevin Costner's debut, which now seems long on principle but short on actual story.\r\n\r\nThe obvious way to prey on Dances with Wolves would be to attack Costner's subsequent career. His later efforts behind the camera have left a lot to be desired, with Waterworld running hugely over budget and The Postman being the dictionary definition of tedious. His acting style and drawling delivery suggest a man who takes himself far too seriously, rivalling only Nicolas Cage for stony-faced absurdity. But a quick glance at his back catalogue reveals a slightly more complicated picture. Lest we forget, Costner was once an admired and popular actor, who acquitted himself perfectly well in No Way Out, The Untouchables and Field of Dreams. And for all the gaping flaws in his directorial efforts, you could never accuse him of going in with anything but the very best intentions.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious quality of Dances with Wolves is that it is very even-handed towards its subject matter. It approaches the relationship between Native Americans and American soldiers with the same restraint and intelligence that Clint Eastwood applied to the subject of revenge in Unforgiven. There has clearly been a lot of effort expended by Costner and the writer Michael Blake to get away from the clichéd depiction of Native Americans as a backward, violent people, who deserved everything they got from the brave, civilised white men driving them off the land in the name of God and Progress.\r\n\r\nYou also have to applaud Costner's ambition as a director. There are few actors, let alone big stars, who would have taken on such a big project first time out. Costner was shooting in mostly external locations for four months, including several elaborate sequences with hundreds of real horses and buffalo. His commitment was such that he nearly broke his back from doing his own stunts, and stumped up over $3m of his own money to cover the costs incurred by bad weather. Costner was prepared to take risks with Dances with Wolves, and that deserves praise regardless of whether the film works or not.\r\n\r\nA further point of admiration comes in Costner's decision to have much of the dialogue spoken in the Lakota language. The fact that the film grossed more than $400m worldwide, and $184m domestically, is a massive raspberry to the notion that Western audiences won't pay to watch films that aren't in the English language. But it also proves that the respect for the different cultures within the film is genuine, not just a device for boosting Costner's artistic standing. This remains the case even after Russell Means pointed out the flawed translations, which left all the men in the film speaking in the female Sioux dialect.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the admiration it generates, Dances with Wolves is in the same league as Battle of Britain in terms of pure good will. But like Battle of Britain, this admiration does not guarantee good drama, and little by little Costner's film begins to look earnest to the point of being dul. It ends up stuck halfway between Unforgiven and Heaven's Gate, being neither as gripping nor elegiac as the former, nor as wretchedly pretentious as the latter. It never becomes as well-meaningly dull as Battle of Britain, but its flaws in terms of pacing and emotion cannot help but prey on our minds.\r\n\r\nThe first 45 minutes of Dances with Wolves are very slow and very portentous. Costner is clearly pulling out all the stops to make us admire and believe in the character of John Dunbar, but he ends up both trying too hard and not enough. The opening battle sequence features Costner attempting suicide by riding straight at the Confederate front line with his arms held out in a messianic pose - a decision which results in sniggers or sneers rather than feelings of empathy. In the various scenes that follow, where Dunbar is sent out to the frontier, too much effort is expended trying to express his bravery and not enough made on showing him as a rounded human being.\r\n\r\nWhen I reviewed (500) Days of Summer, I argued that the presence of a narrator in any kind of film creates an element of certainty which can sometimes work against dramatic tension. In the case of Dances with Wolves, one could argue it is necessary since the diary is integral to the later stages of the plot. But while it is partially justified on a narrative level, Costner's delivery of it is frankly third-rate. His readings feel rushed and increasingly desperate, as he tries to convey the gravity of the situation without much success.\r\n\r\nThe narration aside, there is precious little about Dances with Wolves which is rushed. At just over 3 hours long (4 hours in its Director's Cut), comparisons with Heaven's Gate are unavoidable; the project was even nicknamed 'Kevin's Gate' after the production delays were leaked to the press. Costner's film is nowhere near as baggy as Heaven's Gate, let alone as self-serving, but it is every bit as drawn out, especially in its final act. Had Kevin gone through with a pair of scissors and lost even 30 seconds from every scene, it would have made a world of difference.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem with Dances with Wolves is that it constantly tells us how important the events are without doing enough to show us why this is the case. There are many beautiful or poignant images throughout, from the hundreds of dead buffalo lying on the plains to the couple's departure from the winter camp. But these images don't carry the weight that they should because we haven't invested enough in the characters to make them any more than pretty compositions.\r\n\r\nThe film is so respectful towards the Sioux that it is almost hesitant to scratch the surface and ask the difficult questions about how their society works, such as the relationship between fathers and sons, and the position of women. This is understandable up to a point, considering the negative depiction of Native Americans in Hollywood throughout the 20th century - a fact which, if you believe Marlon Brando, led him to turn down his second Oscar. But you would think that if Costner were brave enough to embark on something of such scale and ambition, the last thing he would be worried about was mildly offending people.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the film does pick up after the first 45 minutes and has moments where the action and characters do take flight. Many of these scenes find Costner willing to let his hair down, whether it's dancing with Two Socks around the camp fire or giving audiences a clear view of his naked bottom. It is hard not to get swept up in the chases scene across the plains, diligently matched by John Barry's stirring score. And some of the lighter moments within the camp help us to relax as well; when Dunbar interrupts Kicking Bird's nearby lovemaking, Graham Greene's facial expression says it all.\r\n\r\nThe romantic aspect of Dances with Wolves is well-played for an epic, if only because the central relationship develops at a reasonable rate. We don't get that agonising sensation as in Out of Africa, where we know the characters are meant to kiss and are begging them to get on with it. The scenes of Stands with a Fist interpreting between Dunbar and Kicking Bird are well-played, serving their purpose while conveying the sexual tension between the characters. Their relationship conveys the conflicted identity of the central characters and the possibility of future harmony between the nations.\r\n\r\nDances with Wolves is ultimately a very middling film. It's too long to adequately serve its story, but not so long that we lose all patience with it. Its respect for its characters undercuts the drama, but not to the extent that we sit there drifting into a coma. And its direction is uninvolving, but not in an artsy, egotistical way. Calling it an average or ordinary film is to belie Costner's ambition, but any higher praise is impossible in light of its flaws. It remains significant but not stirring, admirable but not engaging, important but not profound.",
