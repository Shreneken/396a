    "summary": "The story of a doctor's extraordinary work in the Sixties with a group of catatonic patients he finds languishing in a Bronx hospital. Speculating that their rigidity may be akin to an extreme form of Parkinsonism, he seeks permission from his skeptical superiors to treat them with L-dopa, a drug that was used to treat Parkinson's disease at the time.",

            "content": "This medical movie was really good. Robin Williams, Robert De Niro, John Heard, Julie Kavner, Penelope Ann Miller, and the rest of the cast did a fantastic job in this movie. This true story about Dr. Malcolm Sayer experimenting on catatonic patients with a medication that can wake them up was dramatic, amazing, and heartfelt. It's about helping people with a condition that could bring them back to who they were and to live freely. If you haven't seen this movie yet, check it out sometime. It's a must see.",

            "content": "You know that this movie takes place in America because there's a scene where doctors are deliberating over administering life-altering medicine because it costs too much. \n\nAwakenings is one of the more endearing movies about a medical professional using a prescription drug for off-label use, but it's pretty one-note - it all comes back around to general sentiments about the quality of life. As Robert De Niro's Leonard recovers from a debilitating neurological condition, Robin Williams' timid doctor finds a similarly renewed love for the things that he's taken for granted. With Williams' charisma combined with the sweetness of seeing forgotten incurables returned to their normal selves, this Penny Marshall adaptation of a true-to-life memoir is certainly a crowd-pleaser and features two of the most beloved actors of their time, but isn't particularly deep or probing. It's essentially an expanded, relatively well-acted version of Flowers for Algernon, giving more deference to the tragedy of Leonard's lost years and keeping the themes simple. I felt more in touch with the tragedy of the mute piano player who gets his ability to play back, however briefly, and that didn't even need any dialogue.\n\nDe Niro got a mark on his career bingo card for a performance with a mental impairment. Plenty of nervous tics and physical exaggeration. (2.5/5)",

            "content": "Although this is an original story, and it's a factual memoir, not a novel, it still feels in some ways like a remake of the 1968 film Charley (aka Flowers For Algernon).  Both stories are about mentally handicapped people who are barely functional; and in some ways put upon and treated as the dregs of society; who are given a miracle drug by doctors; and then all of a sudden they are normalized; their intelligence dramatically increases as a result of this drug; they are able to live and function as normal adults for the first time; and we in the audience are elated by the enhancement of their abilities and the quality of their lives overall.  Then we find out the drug is only temporary, and we see their tragic deterioration to their former state.  Both stories examine the ethics of such experiments; and also examine the ableism in society which punishes people unfairly for having a disability; and rewards people for being \"average\"; even when none of that is any of our doing; it is all out of our hands.  While Awakenings was a true story, a documented memoir of a real experiment that was done by scientist Oliver Sachs, and Charley is fiction; the author of Charley, Daniel Keyes loosely based his novel on real observations of how the elderly are treated in society; as well as other situations of ableism that he had observed: so it's not surprising that there are some universal truths and through lines with both stories.  Both Robert De Niro and Cliff Robertson give brilliant performances; both nominated for Oscars, (and Robertson won!). Both films are very moving and highly recommended; it would be very fascinating to watch these back to back and make comparisons between the two!",

            "content": "My aversion to Robin Williams partially colored how I viewed this film but fortunately the other elements of the production were enough for me to overlook how annoying the lead was. Director Penny Marshall made two hilarious, smart comedies in Big (1988) and A League of Their Own (1992) but she proved she could pull of serious drama with this critical and commercial success that garnered a Best Picture nomination. I found myself charmed by the film as while it's emotional manipulations were fairly obvious they were well executed and the story was surprisingly gripping as we see the impact that a discovery like this could have on the lives of regular men and women.\n\nIn the late 1920s, as a young child Leonard Lowe, Robert De Niro, begins suffering from encephalitis lethargica and soon enters into a catatonic state which he remains in until 1969 when he is being treated at a hospital in New York. He is helped by ambitious new physician Malcolm Sayer, Robin Williams, who is a proponent of the drug L-Dopa for treating sufferers of Lowe's disease. He chooses Lowe as a test patient and the results are almost immediate as while Lowe's loving mother, Ruth Nelson, has her doubts he is able to regain consciousness and walk and talk normally. He is shocked and excited by the modern world and as other patients at the hospital are treated they begin to really enjoy themselves. He falls in love with the daughter of another patient, Paula, Penelope Ann Miller, but his tics resurface and he returns to the catatonic state he had previously been in. Sayer records his regression and Lowe's experiences are used to help research the issue and make future patients lives easier.\n\nThe best parts of the film follow Lowe as he delights in seeing the world around him. In a particularly lovely montage he and Sayer wander around town to the sounds of The Zombies' \"The Time of the Season\" and finally end up at the beach where Lowe walks into the water and stands triumphant. This is a glorious moment not only because De Niro gives a convincing and sweet performance but because Marshall is careful to guide the audience through this world through the eyes of Lowe. Of course it is touching to see him fall in love with a kind, intelligent young woman but these scenes too have something special to them as Miller and De Niro have an enthusiasm rare in films of this sort and the dialogue they share feels honest and simple. We can expect that a woman would fall in love with a man because he is kind, honest and decent, unlike many films of this era this movie believes that a woman could fall in love with a man because he is good. We know that the heartbreak must come but Marshall ensures that these scenes of Lowe's happiness are not wasted and we share in his ecstasy.\n\nThe less said about Williams' performance the better as he pulls out his usual tricks, the uncomfortable smile during which he appears to be crying and the manic, angry speech. Fortunately he does not take up too much of the film and we get to enjoy our time with the supporting characters who are lively and colorful despite being nurses and patients, often characters relegated to being dull. Julie Kavner, during the Woody Allen phase of her career, impresses as a nurse sympathetic to Sayer's plight who also has romantic interest in him. Her strength and ability for light comedy shine through in this small role and hint at the bigger things that would come for her in the ensuing years. The director draws this sort of performance out of even the least significant actors and shows that she was truly an actor's director.\n\nI may not have nominated this film for Best Picture but is better than Ghost (1990), Dances with Wolves (1990) and The Godfather Part III (1990) so I clearly did not agree with the decisions that the Academy made in that particular year. I would have preferred to have seen Metropolitan (1990), Avalon (1990), The Nasty Girl (1990) and Open Doors (1990) nominated but this is still a nice little film deserving of wide recognition. ",

            "content": "A deeply moving testament to the power of medicine and empathy.\n\nPenny Marshall's medical drama Awakenings (1990) is a profoundly moving film. I find it captures the belief in medical science that doctors should aspire to, but more so relating to their patients' suffering and condition.\n\nMarshall bravely represents a lost portion of society that have been left to die catatonic and hopeless in hospitals. Awakenings is inspired filmmaking from Marshall and inspiring as a story to remind the audience to live life to the fullest of your ability.\n\nRandy Newman delivers his finest musical compositions with his affectionate jazz score. Newman underscores the harsh reality of Awakenings with delicate jazz brought to life with tender piano melodies throughout the film. It fits perfectly and swells just in the right emotional moments. Newman's score just mesmerizes me.\n\nSteven Zaillian's beautiful script is brought to life by numerous brilliant performances within Awakenings' magnificent cast.\n\nNamely, Robin Williams is so tender and empathetic as Dr. Malcolm Sayer. Awakenings is Williams' finest dramatic role as he finds an appreciation for the most down trodden selection of people and opens up to them. Robin Williams will sorely be missed for the warmth, joy, and compassion he brought to his characters and the world.\n\nSimilarly, Robert De Niro is inspired Leonard Lowe, a catatonic patient who is given a new life, as he recreates the afflictions suffered by those with a terrible disease. De Niro slurs his speech, lies still, walks with a limp, shakes his hands and arms, violently spasms his head, averts his eyes, droops his mouth, and any other number of realistic aspects to accurately portray his debilitated character. De Niro's depth for humanity shines in Awakenings as the very much alive Lowe. His love and appreciation for love are given to the audience through De Niro's passionate and method performance.\n\nFurthermore, Julie Kavner is adorable as the sweet nurse Eleanor Costello. Her perseverance for her patients and her love are admirable. Kavne plays the character perfectly.\n\nThen, Awakenings features an astonishing supporting cast of actors and actresses. John Heard is so stingy and cold as Dr. Kaufman. Penelope Ann Miller is so sweet and likable as the hopeful Paula. Max von Sydow gets a cool cameo as the knowledge expert on the movie's main disease concern. His research scene with Robin Williams is gripping and moving, if sad and disturbing at his implications of how horrendous the disease can be. Peter Stormare has a funny cameo as a sleazy, nonchalant neurochemist.\n\nAdditionally, Awakenings has several other neat supporting roles played wonderfully by Ruth Nelson, George Martin, Richard Libertini, Alice Drummond, Judith Malina, Bradley Whitford, Mary Alice, Keith Diamond, and even jazz legend Dexter Gordon. Would you believe a young Vin Diesel plays an orderly somewhere in there too?\n\nOverall, Awakenings is an enchanting drama about the power of life and the importance of trying to do what is right. The acting is stellar and worth seeing just for Robin Williams and Robert De Niro alone.",

            "content": "\"I'm sorry! If you were right, I would agree with you\".\n\nDespite being a prominent director throughout the 80's and 90's, surprisingly, Penny Marshall seemed to hang up her boots after 2001's Driving in Cars with Boys. To be fair, her films always had a cloying or whimsical tinge to them and her last few movies didn't reach the enjoyable heights of her earlier work like A League of Their Own and Big but she always showed promise as a director - with Awakenings, arguably, being her most accomplished work.\n\nIn 1969, Dr. Malcolm Sayer (Robin Williams) takes a Neurology position in a Brooklyn Psychiatric hospital where he finds patients that have been in a catatonic state for decades due to a condition known as post-encephalitis. With further investigation, he focuses on Leonard Lowe (Robert DeNiro) and begins to prescribe a drug called L-Dopa. Miraculously, Leonard responds to the drug, awakes from his \"sleepy-disease\" and begins to move, talk and embrace life once more.\n\nBased on the true life events depicted in Dr. Oliver Sacks' novel of the same name, Marshall has a solid handling of the material. Steven Zaillian's script has a good balance of humour and pathos and an all-important sensitivity to the characters while Marshall is aided with a wonderful cast where she's able to tease out heartfelt, powerful performances.\n\nEven the relative unknowns bring something to the table but, ultimately, it's the two major players who shine brightest: Robin Williams brings real humanity to his excruciatingly shy doctor while DeNiro is a tic-ridden, tour-de-force as his patient and delivers one of his very best, and heartbreaking, performances. It would not be out of place to argue both actors deliver some career best work here. Williams plays it absolutely straight and resists any urge to wisecrack or improvise while DeNiro is simply astonishing. You can watch him, fully informed of his acting prowess, yet he still manages to convince you that his involuntary movements and speech patterns aren't for real. DeNiro was rightly awarded with an Oscar nomination for his work but why he didn't win is beyond me. In fact, it must have been a frustrating year for him at the Academy Awards in 1991. He lost the Best Actor award to Jeremy Irons in Reversal of Fortune but this was the same year that one of DeNiro's best films - Goodfellas - would be overlooked and his good friend Martin Scorsese also ignored for Best Director. On reflection (although not unsurprising) the Academy made a number of mistakes but there's no doubt in my mind that DeNiro took the brunt of it and thoroughly deserved more for his output that year. His work as Leonard Lowe is truly captivating and epitomises the sheer breadth that DeNiro is capable of. Actors embodying a disability or medical condition tend to be Oscar bait with the likes of Dustin Hoffman (Rain Man), Tom Hanks (Forrest Gump) notably winning the Academy over. As good as they were, DeNiro's performance is even better than those and the only exception that just might overshadow them all is Daniel Day-Lewis in My Left Foot. \n\nDespite my admiration, Awakenings has come in for some criticism. In particular, a forced sentimentality has been found by many. I suppose this will depend on the individual viewer and in a sense I can see why they might think that. However, I found the sentimentality to be well judged and the performances balanced and authentic. That said, there's no denying it's ability to bring on the water works. It's hard to keep a dry eye (especially with the help of Randy Newman beautifully pitched score) but I, personally, didn't see this as being overly sentimental but more about it having the ability to relate and draw you into it's very personal and tragic story. And what a story it is. Admittedly, I never read the late Dr. Sacks' novel on which it's based but I did read his memoirs and case studies told in The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and that, like Awakenings, was a book of medical revelations and anomalies that are nothing short of fascinating.\n\nPowerful and affecting, Awakenings is a film that captures the heart and triumph of the human spirit to it's empathic core. It also provides two exceptionally excellent performances from Williams and, especially, DeNiro. It's through these captivating performances that we are allowed access to the wonder and bewilderment of human conditions and Penny Marshall's delicate handling brings it to the fore. \n\nA genuine treat from the early 90's that possesses one of Williams' strongest dramatic roles and one of DeNiro's last truly committed.\n\nMark Walker",

Robin Williams kept his serious-role hat on after Dead Poets Society, anchoring the story with another brilliant, understated performance, but, such is the case with everything he's ever in, Robert De Niro steals the show with his turn as one of the affected patients. The script pretty much writes itself, but Steven Zaillian, who would later go on to write Saving Private Ryan, does an admiral job. But despite the wonderful true-to-life source material, the script feels a little too turnkey, the story is predicable and clich\u00e9d and there are two jarring tonal shifts. No matter, Awakenings has an amalgamation of magic, realism and optimism that few films have, making one of the best hidden gems of a truly sensational decade of cinema.",

On a hunch he believes drug will bring previous catatonic patient Lowe back to a functioning person. The drug works, but this film enlightens on how patients might feel or act even treated and that is not always a happy ending. Some come to realize all they have lost, and in the case of Lowe, begins to regress as if life is now taken away. Awakenings was a really good luck on the struggles and challenges of battling mental illness from its peaks to its valleys. Williams and De Niro work great together and really seem to give this story the light it deserves.",

Robin Williams while working in the hospital finds a chemical that enables deniro to talk, have feeling, and eventually become normal again.\n\nThe Rest of the patients get the chemical and their lives become normal.

You buy into who this guy is. He's a loner who cares about others more than himself.\n\nThen you get Deniro character.  What a masterful performance.  You see him act in a comatose state, a serious state, an erratic state, and extremely emotional.  It is hard to watch at times due to the suffering these patients go through when the drug stops to work and they revert back to the comatose state.  Deniro suffers from twitches and he just nails it.

One of the ones I decided to watch was the 1990 film \"Awakenings\". This film got nominated for best picture and Robert De Niro got nominated for best actor. I thought this was an excellent film and completely deserving of a best picture nomination. The performances here are excellent particularly from Robert De Niro who made you really care for his character even though there are sometimes when he goes insane and some parts where he doesn't even talk. The late Robin Williams is also wonderful as the doctor and protagonist of the film. The film has a smart and interesting script that makes you feel for the characters and plot. There aren't many problems with the film but there are a few. One problem I had with it is that I would've like to have seen more character development outside of De Niro's character and also I think the film got a bit to slow at some points. But those are just minor flaws in an otherwise fantastic film with great performances and a great script. I highly recommend this film as it is highly moving and effective. Go see it.",

            "content": "Directed by Penny Marshall, and starring Robert de Niro and Robin Williams (along with a few other familiar faces), AWAKENINGS is a wonderful film which explores the deep-seated human need for personal connections and the vitality they bring to life. Robert de Niro plays Leonard Lowe, a patient who has been catatonic for 30 years. Robin Williams plays Dr. Malcolm Sayer, a neurologist who works at the hospital where Leonard and many others like him are patients. The plot is about how Dr. Sayer treats these patients with an experimental drug and monitors how it affects them, with Leonard being his first/initial test case. At this point, I'll refrain from describing the plot. What needs to be said more than anything is that the character work by de Niro and Williams is some of the best I've seen from them, and really showed a devotion to their craft. In particular, de Niro stands out because his role as a catatonic patient probably required extreme physical discipline as well as having to internalize his character's thoughts a lot of the time. Robin Williams is also excellent as the introvert doctor who gradually comes to an awakening of his own. The film isn't particularly subtle about what the audience is supposed to take from these two parallel characters, but the subject is treated deftly and not spoon-fed. I also liked the insight into the workings of a hospital in the late 60's, and the interactions between the various members of the supporting cast. In particular, Julie Kavner (voices Marge on The Simpsons) gave a wonderful, understated performance as the head nurse, and who also develops a special bond with Dr. Sayer. The only minor complaint I have is that de Niro might have gone too method at a couple points in the film, with his characterization bordering on the cartoonish. Still, he manages to make his character accessible and sympathetic. Overall, I felt that this film was a sweet look at human interaction, love, and making up for lost time. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "Here's my review for Awakenings and boy is it quite a movie.\n\nPlot: Dr. Sayer is a dedicated and caring physician at a local hospital where he especially works with Catatonia. Sayer begins to discover certain stimuli that reaches beyond the patients' states except for one particular patient named Leonard who is able to communicate via Ouija board. But when he hears about the L-Dopa drug and what it does for people with Parkinson's disease, Sayer decides to use the drug on Leonard believing that it can be used as a breakthrough for all the patients.\n\nWow. Just wow. This tells a remarkable story about what it means to be alive and to be free making it very moving and heartwarming. And nowhere is that spectacularly shown then in the performances from Robert DeNiro and Robin Williams. DeNiro did an excellent job with how he spoke, moved reacted to what was happening around him. When I brought up that I finally saw this movie to my brother Tommy, he expressed how this movie expresses that Robin Williams is a very underrated actor. And he's absolutely right. This is a Robin Williams that we should really see more often: a great dramatic actor. In this film he does no voices, says no jokes, just doesn't try to be funny in any way. It's just pure dramatic acting and he does a wonderful job at it to the point where it's just doesn't make sense to me that he wasn't even nominated for his performance at the Oscars that year. This is a side of Robins Williams as an actor that I think we should see much more of. Heck, I recently found out that he's in the upcoming movie The Butler later this year and it looks like he'll be serious in that one too which would be awesome. The rest of the performances are very well done as well, Julie Kavner seems to be the most notable aside from DeNiro and Williams (fun fact; she's Marge Simpsons from The Simpsons.) And of coarse the story just draws you to want to know more about what happened to the character and what is being done today with Cantonia or things related to that.\n\nAnd that's my review for Awakenings. It tells a dramatic and moving story with wonderful performances from DeNiro and Williams and a message that expresses what it means to be alive and interest you more about what is happening today about a subject like Cantonia. It's a great movie, highly recommended.",

My brother recommended it to me years ago, and since he is not into movies, so once he is captured by a movie, i know it's a good one.\r\n\r\nApart from my brother, I found Awakeknings is very beautiful and heartwarming, but not a tearjerking like some found-or maybe I am not used  to sheding a tear through movies. It has also some light scenes. They are not abundant, but sufficient for a movie dealing with catatonic conditions.\r\n\r\nEveryone here is perfect playing his role, and I mean everyone, from the two leads to the secondary roles. For Robert De Niro, he is excellent through the entire movie especially through the scenes where he acts as if he can't control his muscles. I think these scenes are difficult enough for any actor to make, but he brilliantly executed them.\r\n\r\nBut frankly, I loved Robin Williams as Dr. Sayer or Dr. Oliver Sacks, the true neurologist whose book is that the movie is based on more. Here he is nerd, earnest, hopefull..Besides being a great comedian, I like hime in dramatic roles. I don't know if that dramatic role was his first then.\r\n\r\nFinally, despite being nominated for three Oscar awards, I think it's underrated, at least among the audience.",

The storytelling flows seamlessly from the beginning to the end, and as I wrote the acting was convincing, although I felt that Dr. Malcolm Sayer, even though not being a representation of Dr. Sacks, was behaving more like a kindergarten lady than a medical doctor. A bit sentimental, if that's the word. Based on Dr. Oliver Sakcs' book by the same name, the film helped bring an important issue of sick, institutionalized people and neurological disease to the consiousness of the people around the world. Another, similar, and equally successful film could have easily been created based one some other of Dr. Sacks' books, which are always so enlightening and well written.",

            "content": "\"People have forgotten what life is all about. They've forgotten what it is to be alive. They need to be reminded.\"\n         \nFollowing the huge success of her 80's comedy, Big, director Penny Marshall decided to approach a much more sensitive and serious subject matter in her next film based on Oliver Sacks' semi-biographical book about his work in a ward with patients in catatonic state. Robin Williams was cast to play Dr. Sacks, although the character's name was changed to Dr. Malcolm Sayer, a shy doctor who prior to have been hired at the ward had very little experience working with patients. He was obsessed with researching and doing lab work, but those skills came in handy when he began treating the catatonic patients at the ward. He discovered that several of the patients that had been in the ward for decades had one thing in common: they had survived a rare form of encephalitis, but the disease left them in their current catatonic state. Most of the doctors believed there was no treatment for these patients, but he began to discover that some of them responded to certain stimuli. Not giving up on them, he decides to attend a lecture where he discovers a new drug that had been effective on patients suffering from Parkinson's, and he believes it might just help awake his patients as well. \n\nCasting Robin Williams for the role and having released this only two years after the commercial success of Big, one could easily have expected this to be a comedy, but casting Robert De Niro as the other lead easily put to rest that assumption. De Niro had also worked on Goodfellas the same year as this and he continued to be at the prime of his career. In Awakenings he plays Leonard Lowe, one of the patients who has remained in the same state for nearly four decades and who is still being cared for by his mother, Mrs. Lowe (Ruth Nelson), at the clinic. With the approval of the other doctors at the ward and Leonard's mother, he is chosen for a trial run with the drug. It doesn't take too long for Dr. Sayer to see the results he was expecting as Leonard seems to wake up from his catatonic state. The two begin to form a special bond and the positive results induce Sayer to test the drug on the rest of the patients in the ward in a similar way. As we become witnesses of Leonard's awakening we also begin to see life through his eyes as someone who feels he has lost so many years and now wants to enjoy life to the fullest. His awakening serves the reclusive Doctor as a reminder to begin living life and enjoying human interaction. There is a sub plot revolving his relationship with a nurse from the ward played by Julie Kavner, but the main theme is Sayer's relationship with these patients. \n\nMarshall's film was nominated for Best Picture, and just like her previous movie it also earned a nomination for the lead actor, De Niro. De Niro does a superb job playing this awakened catatonic patient, and it is evident that he did his homework and studied every single facial and body tic of the real patients. Sacks had filmed his patients in real life during their awakening periods and so there was a lot of material they had to work with. Robin Williams plays a much more restrained character than what we were used to seeing him do, so his performance might not seem as delightful as his other films but he delivers a solid dramatic turn. The third nomination that the film received was for Steven Zaillian's adapted screenplay which was powerful. He didn't win the Oscar for this film, but he went on to win it two years later for his work in Schindler's List. Spielberg said it was his adaptation in Awakenings that earned him the job for his film. This movie is emotional and touching without being manipulative because it sticks to the true story which was definitely one that had to be told in the big screen.         \n\nhttp://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",

Its a film about true happiness in life, a movie about the beauty of the human mind, and a movie that can just up lift your spirits where its very hard to be depressed watching a masterpiece like this.  This movie showed me much about how a mind can be just in a vegetable like state and it also reminded me of one of my favorite films One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest, both are just perfect movies and Awakenings is a movie that showed me and taught me so much about life.\n\n  The story follows Dr. Sayer (Robin Williams) and his patient Leonard (Robert DeNiro).  Leonard has been in a mentally ill state for about 30 years and he lives at a mental institution.  Sayer has discovered a drug that maybe able to help Leonard and decides to try and help him, and then when the drug is a success Sayer decides to use it on his other patients.  Leonard however is new to this world and is trying adjust to life and love when he meets a beautiful woman. These two men might find what they needed in life after all.\n\n  The plot was incredible and showed me so much about life and its surroundings.  The way Leonard is adjusting to life and is learning all these new skills and you wonder what it would be like to be cut off from the world for that long, and his awakening just made me smile, such a masterpiece.  The characters are incredibly detailed and interesting if you ask me.  Dr. Sayer is a great man and I could easily like him and how he just wants to help these peoole with the goodness of his heart.  Leonard however is the show stealer, his awakening into a new life is something to behold and he grows to be very smart and kind and gets many emotions which showed me a lot about a human life, such a beautiful character.  This story was incredible as were the characters and just everything about it.\n\n  The cast stars two of some of the best actors I can think of and they both play Oscar worthy performances.  Robert DeNiro is a incredible actor and this is one of those movies he will be remembered for, his performance as a mentally ill man is uncanny at how beautiful he does it.  Robin Williams is a amazing actor, whenever he plays an emotional role he does it with perfect aim and he is impossible not to love.  The entire cast fo their role great but these two actors will be remembered for a few roles in life, and I believe this will be one of them.\n\n  Awakenings is a film I consider almost impossible to not like.  Its has everything a movie needs to be perfect, a true and honest story and characters, a great cast, and great production that form this to be a movie that I found extremely insightful.  If you need a film that will show you a true side of human life and makes you think about things that you have botheted to overlook, which is something Leonard mentions in the film that humans overlook the little details in life which I found to be a beautiful theme that the film taught and I can honestly recommend this movie to everyone who wants the perfect drama.",

Oh, the irony. Well, to be fair, I also took this morning off because my reviewing skills are at their absolute weakest in the morning and at their very best at night. Boy, what a night to have the creative juices flowing, because we've got some stuff to discuss here. Of course, not all of it is good, as the film suffers from a lack of development, overdrawn segments, expendable sequences and a deal of cheesy points in the final act. Really, there's not much to complain about in the film, but there's not a whole lot to praise. Of course, what little there is to praise is really something to discuss.\r\n\r\nThe only small filmmaking pros seem to be some snappy editing and a decent pacing. Of course, the film doesn't want to be some revolution in filmmaking. It just wants to tell a compelling and fascinating story and succeeds, thanks to the good writing and brilliant performances. Every cast member carries extreme charisma and play their part well, keeping the film both entertaining and compelling. As for the patients, each one of them is portrayed sharply and believably. De Niro, in particular executes the many layers of his character the most cleanly and arguably the most believably. However, when the twist in his character comes and subtlety isn't going to cut it anymore, he's well balanced and extremely competent, making him easily the best performance in the film.\r\n\r\nOh wow, this review was not nearly as good as I thought it was going to be. Oh well, at least it's not as forced as my morning reviews. Trying to make a deep discussion out of the music in \"The Mission\". What was I thinking? But, I that's beside the point. Overall, \"Awakenings\", carried by charismatic, competent performances from just about the whole cast, - particularly De Niro - is a deeply fascinating, compelling and often emotionally impacting portrait on liberation and loss.",

There are some great performances and it has many ups and downs along the way. It is based on a book by Oliver Sacks, a true story which will play at your heartstrings at times. More of my thoughts later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters and those that don't wish to know anything about the plot please help get Leonard back into bed while I write the next paragraph).\r\n\r\nDr. Malcolm Sayer has always worked in research because he doesn't really get on with people. He has to take a job at a hospital where he has no choice but to work with the patients. There he meets, amongst his patients, Leonard Lowe, who has been in a catatonic state for thirty years. With the help of his assistant, Eleanor Costello, Dr. Sawyer carries out a series of tests to discover just what is wrong with him. He eventually discovers it is to do with an encephalitis epidemic back in the 1920's and it is now the late 60's. Convinced he can find as cure, reads up on all the current medications and finds an experimental drug that might do the trick. His boss, Dr. Kaufman, will only let him try it on one patient, he chooses Leonard and thus begins the awakenings... but will it last, and what are the consequences? I'll have to leave it there so as not to be beaten by the Spoiler Police.\r\n\r\nThis is a really well made film with a beautiful score by Randy Newman, enhanced with many songs, both old and new. Great performances all round, particularly from Robert De Niro as Leonard Lowe and Robin Williams as Dr. Malcolm Sayer, who both went and observed Oliver Sacks and his patients prior to making this film, and it showed. I also have to mention Julie Kavner, it's nice to see the voice of Marge Simpson as a real person for a change. Honourable mentions also go to; Ruth Nelson as Mrs. Lowe (Leonard's mother), John Heard as Dr, Kaufman and it was also nice to see a brief cameo from Max von Sydow as Dr. Peter Ingham.\r\n\r\nAlthough it starts off a little schmaltzy, this film grows into an engrossing drama with engaging characters and an interesting plot. There are hints of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) here and there, but I can forgive that, after all, it's not a bad film to be compared with. Over all, it's pretty good and well worth a viewing... Recommended.\r\n\r\nMy score: 7.6/10",

While made during the era of Hollywood feel-goodness, this is still a poignant story of sorrow and hope. With a great performance by De Niro, I personally think Williams performance stands out here (showing why he went on to do more similar dramatic roles later). While it tries a little too hard at times to pull on the heart strings, there are many genuine moments of insight bringing the viewers into an awakening of their own.",

            "content": "Based on the book by Oliver Sacks, Awakenings tells the story of two men, Dr Malcolm Sayer who joins the staff of a chronic care psychiatric hospital and one of his charges, Leonard Lowe, a catatonic patient following the after effects of encephalytis thirty years earlier.\r\n\r\nWhen Sayer finds a common link between Leonard's condition and that of several other patients, Sayer looks to help the patients with an experimental drug by trialling it on Leonard.\r\n\r\nWhen Leonard is revived from his condition by the drug, the hospital's patrons funds the use of the drug to all of the other patients and they experience similar awakenings, but is this a miracle cure... or a false dawn?\r\n\r\n=============================================================\r\n\r\nPLEASE DO NOT READ ON UNLESS YOU HAVE SEEN THE FILM - SPOILERS\r\n\r\n\r\nI saw this film back in 1991 and it's as powerful to me now as it was back then.  This is primarily made through the performances of the two lead actors.\r\n\r\nRobert De Niro delivers a powerful performance in the role of Leonard, in what is in essence a three act play for the character.  The first 45 minutes or so presents a character that we're not used to seeing De Niro play - immobile, non speaking, helpless and, yet, you can't keep your eyes off him.  The second act presents Leonard as the man waking up from his thirty year \"sleep\" - rediscovering life, a means of expression and the bonds of friendship, family and even, a romance of sorts.  The third acts presents Leonard as the man who's chance of life is cruelly snatched away from him as the effects of the drug become equally as problematic as the illness itself.  De Niro is exceptional in all aspects of the role of Leonard.\r\n\r\nRobin Williams delivers an equally powerful performance as Sayer.  Where Leonard and the other patients are trapped in a statue like state due to their neurological condition, Sayer is trapped emotionally due to his shyness, inability to bond with people and the fact that he is basically a research doctor rather than a physician.  The magic of this film is  as Leonard awakens, so does the character of Sayer and whereas we are used to the manic version of Robin Williams through various performances, this film presents Williams as a quiet, introverted and well played character actor and you wish that he had taken more roles such as this.\r\n\r\nBoth actors are ably supported by a brilliant supporting cast most notably Julie Kavner as hospital nurse and Sayer's main ally, Eleanor Costello, John Heard as Dr Kaufman - presented as the main \"road block\" to Sayer's plan to help the patients and Penelope Ann Miller as Leonard's \"romantic\" interest, Paula.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, all the actors who portray Leonard's fellow patients delivers great performances as they awaken from their condition and convey the patients' love for the simple things in life - like dancing, singing, going out on trips and finding out about a world that's left them behind.\r\n\r\nPenny Marshall's direction and the script by Steven Zaillan is emotionally clever with it's audience by delivering emotion without the sugary nature that these films tend to have.\r\n\r\nA great film.",

            "content": "More Magical Disabled People  \r\n\r\nNo one in the movies ever just happens to have a problem, be it physical or mental.  Heck, it's a revelation when someone just has a cough without dying by the end of the picture.  And, yes, of course this is a movie about the problems of the characters, about the illness.  On the other hand, there are also people in it who are destined to be cured by the illness of others.  Everything will get better except for what's wrong with the characters who, to be fair, had no real hope of cure at the beginning of the film.  I also know that this is based, however theoretically, on a true story.  Even if I hadn't, the movie takes pains to tell us such at the beginning and gives us a card at the end to tell us the results after the movie.  Much of what happens still feels like a cheat to me.\r\n\r\nDr. Malcolm Sayer (Robin Williams) has spent as little time as possible among actual humans.  Unfortunately, he has, for reasons I'm not entirely clear on, been forced to this time.  On the other hand, his job is in what's called \"the garden.\"  In that all they do is feed and water the patients; they're all completely unresponsive.  Except they are not.  Lucy (Alice Drummond) turns out to be able to catch her glasses to keep them from falling.  Sayer discovers that almost all of his patients respond to one stimulus or another.  Catching balls or bobbing their heads to music.  And then, Sayer tries, for reasons which make sense in-story, a drug called L-DOPA, used initially as a treatment for Parkinson's.  It works.  Among those brought out of their stupor is Leonard Lowe (Robert De Niro), and he helps Dr. Sayer learn to live and laugh and love again, in particular Nurse Eleanor Costello (Julie Kavner).\r\n\r\nWhen we talked about the American [i]Insomnia[/i], we talked about how Christopher Nolan succeeded in getting understated performances, mostly, out of both Robin Williams and Al Pacino.  Here, Penny Marshall got understated performances out of Robin Williams and Robert De Niro.  Not once, not once, does Robin Williams do shtick.  There is no wackiness of any kind.  Similarly, Robert De Niro doesn't shout.  Isn't threatening in any way.  The seizures he begins to experience toward the end of the movie are a little hard to watch, but I don't think it's all that dissimilar to real seizures, not that I have much experience with them.  Though my grandmother did suffer from Parkinson's herself.  There is terribly little humour to the movie at all, really, and mostly it's at the expense of people who essentially don't matter to the story.  At least we are laughing kind of equally at the stuffy hospital administrators and the woman terrified of a pen.\r\n\r\nIn some ways, the thing I feel most sympathy with is the mysterious passage of time.  When Leonard wakes, he is no longer a child.  (I don't know how accurate it is.)  His mother (Ruth Nelson) has sat by her son's bedside for decades, watching him grow older but not thinking that he might possibly grow up.  After all, when there is no personality to consider, there is no reason to think that the personality might change.  There is also Rose (Judith Malina), astonished to find that she has grown old and does not remember middle age.  She asks specifically for makeup and hair dye so that she may look like the person she remembers seeing in the mirror.  I think everyone is sometimes caught in a moment where they realize how old they are, but at least we can put together memory of those years.  These people have been without time.\r\n\r\nAt one point in the movie, the hope is expressed that these people are experiencing nothing, because no one wants to think about the alternative.  No one wants to think about the prospect of seeing and hearing and thinking but knowing that no one knows that you do.  Not being able to move.  Not being able to let your loved ones--and those who are just taking care of you--know that you know they are even there.  I must admit that I am more afraid of the prospect of my brain just sort of slipping away, but that doesn't mean I am interested in this experience instead.  Being alone in your head for over forty years?  No.  Even if the inside of my head were a nicer place to be.  I don't know if we know whether they experience anything in the . . . I don't really want to call it coma, because I think that's the wrong word, but \"stupor\" calls up unfortunate images.  Say, then, that we do not know if these people were empty or in their brains that whole time.  Neither prospect is particularly appealing.",

Honestly, that's what I initially thought of \"Awakenings\", a sentimental film that will do nothing but to put one of the missing pieces of De Niro's more than impressive resume' into place; oh, how wrong I was. Though his performance was great, it was his sense of belonging among the other encephalitis-stricken characters that made the portrayal so absorbing. To a more flamboyant performer, he could have easily stole every single scene with some scenery-chewing moments. But De Niro, having to do justice to such a critical character, has carried himself with methodical devotion as Leonard Lowe, going into great lengths to show the physical sufferings of an encephalitis victim, but also hinting, with subtle motions and glances, the depths of the characters' heart and the reaches of his mind that was enclosed inside a physical limbo for 30 years. But the best performance came from Robin Williams(though not nominated for an Academy Award) as the socially awkward Dr. Sayer, whose characterization started in the middle but ended on something to begin with. My tears, tested by the span of years I've been watching films, are quite adamant to sentimental displays on screen, but this one, since \"Letters from Iwo Jima\", I believe, finally persuaded them to just trickle down in peace. Although based on a true story, I will always think of the film's \"awakenings\" as symbolic series of inner defiance, brought forth by the indomitable power of the human spirit against the shackles of physical invalidity.",

            "content": "Awakening to the world after thirty years, lost youth, the incomprehensible loss of who you were in contrast to who you could be in the future, is a heavy subject matter. Luckily we have the extraordinary efforts of actors Robin Williams and Robert De Niro to encapsulate the spectrum of human behavioral science and emotion. The aspects of the film that make it true are for certain the most astounding, drawing on the experiences of neurologist and author Oliver Sacks, who worked with catatonic patients from the 1917-1928 encephalitis epidemic. What is really very disturbing about the film, is watching fictionalized Dr. Malcolm Sayer come to the conclusion that these patients are in fact only sedate, and have the mental faculties to make a full recovery. This is both good news for their future state, and devastatingly horrifying to think of their mental prison for the past thirty years, trying to communicate with the broader world but being limited by their own body. We watch the good doctor bring back Leonard Lowe (De Niro), a child at the time of his crisis, and now a full grown man with the faculties of an infant. His transformation is subdued, nothing overall astounding about his awakening, since no one seems able to witness them when they happen. He wakes from sleep, recognizes that he's back with the tender joy of a child, and remembers the death of his former state, but not the events of the past thirty years. As the other patients also awaken, and their journey begins, we're fed the horror of wasted life, the principle of the film to drive you into living when others cannot. The premise was executed in a fairly original way, the acting was sincere and realistic for the otherworldly circumstances that developed from it, and everything is believable and neither sappy nor unenjoyable. It's only the longwinded approach to certain sections that keeps me from enjoying it through and through, the lack of true depression at the very end, only the possibility for Sayer to finally live now that he's seen the worst of unused potential. It's too bittersweet a taste for me when I've gone through the rigmarole of this film.",

It`s very touching and you won`t regret it :)\nnot to tell that DE NIRO`s acting is SO PERFECT and sometimes even fun :) I imagined many times the recording sets :P",
