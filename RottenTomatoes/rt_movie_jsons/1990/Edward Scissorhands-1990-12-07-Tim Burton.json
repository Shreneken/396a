    "summary": "A scientist (Vincent Price) builds an animated human being -- the gentle Edward (Johnny Depp). The scientist dies before he can finish assembling Edward, though, leaving the young man with a freakish appearance accentuated by the scissor blades he has instead of hands. Loving suburban saleswoman Peg (Dianne Wiest) discovers Edward and takes him home, where he falls for Peg's teen daughter (Winona Ryder). However, despite his kindness and artistic talent, Edward's hands make him an outcast.",

            "content": "Early in his career, director Tim Burton finally matched his visual creativeness with a sense of restraint with the remarkable Edward Scissorhands.  Created by a Frankenstein-like inventor (Vincent Price) in a castle overlooking a quaint American town, Edward (Johnny Depp) is a young man bereft of both social skills and hands, which have been replaced by a scissor-like contraption.  When rescued from the mansion and escorted into town by the local Avon lady (Dianne Wiest), after initially being accepted by the locals, soon finds himself in peril as the result of not being able to conform.  The movie, a story of acceptance and assimilation, works on the strength of the performances, a gorgeous color palette, a great score by Danny Elfman, and some impressive cinematography.  Edward Scissorhands, arguable Burton's best film, is as great today as it was when it was initially released.",

            "content": "Back in the days when Tim Burton could throw out these fantasy parables with almost carefree abandon, and the axis of him-Johnny Depp-Danny Elfman was still in its infancy, we loved this film. Coming back to it now, it remains funny, charming, warm and yet still comfortable in its gothic clothes and darker tones. This side of adulthood and with adopted children, it's fairly plainly a parable about adoption - not to mention being a child, ableism, race and any other outsider looking in kind of theme you care to mention. Seeing suburbia through the outsider's eyes is not an unusual idea in films, but this does it better than most - a film that's lost none of it's wonder and capacity to surprise.",
