Although I only watched four of the movie adaptations, (others being The Green Mile, The Shawshank Redemption, and The Body) Misery still wins the medal of the ultimate Stephen King story... So far. And what I love more about the movie is that it is as if I were watching something that was just copy and pasted from the book, yet it changed some things, added new things, (Such as going outside of the perspective of Paul Sheldon) and one more thing, nearly perfected the masterpiece that was the words that Stephen King put down on paper.",

I suppose the jump scares, when they come, are a bit more impactful though, due to this, if that makes sense but I'd classify it as primarily psychological based. I found the characterisations probably the best aspect of the film, with great performances from both James Caan and Kathy Bates. Paul's frustration and desperation to leave his confines makes for quite a gripping watch, although there are some parts of the plot which may be a little slow moving for some people's taste. I suppose as time moves on, some film viewers may be more impatient than those of the past perhaps. The topic/theme of obsessive fans is, if anything, more relevant or contemporary than ever in the age of social media, I reckon and so it makes for a somewhat thought provoking watch as well. The presence of the typewriter made me think of The Shining (also based on a Stephen King novel), only in this instance its not the villain who uses it, rather the victim.\n\nThis is certainly a decent film that's, as I say, well worth a watch and so I would recommend it, yes.",

I never tire of it, and returning to it feels akin to visiting a reliable old friend. Scrutiny may reveal the scattered sources of the underlying secret to its allure; the performances are iconic and memorable, the scenario is obviously a personal one for Stephen King, the suspense is palpable, and the setting confers the charm and the danger of quiet isolation. Then, of course, there is the stunning creation which is Annie Wilkes and the frighteningly off-kilter manner in which Kathy Bates animates her on the screen. It may also be noted that a comic element belies the film's horror, always enrapturing us in a fashion that simultaneously scares and welcomes us. As the title of the film suggests, misery is certainly the name of the game for poor Paul Sheldon, but for the rest of us, the misnomer couldn't be more apparent.",

The screenplay is very fine, exploring themes such as fanatical devotion, artistic dilemmas and worthiness of commercial fiction without a psychological suspense context, while the story is always well paced and compelling.\n\nAlso outstanding is the direction of Rob Reiner. He adeptly exercises in chilling claustrophobia and allows a numerous numbers of genuine jolts. The acting is great, James Caan, Richard Farnsworth and Lauren Bacall are all great but the film belongs to Kathy Bates who is monstrously scary and deservedly won an Oscar for her brilliant performance.\n\nOverall, Misery is a superb film and one of the best Stephen King adaptations. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "With sharp direction by Rob Reiner, a screenplay by William Goldman adapted from a novel by Stephen King, cinematography by Barry Sonnenfeld, and a cast that includes Lauren Bacall, Richard Farnsworth, James Caan, and Kathy Bates there's little wonder how Misery turned out so well. Even with all of this talent behind and in front of the camera, the key to Misery's success is the phenomenal and chilling performance by Kathy Bates as Annie Wilkes, one of the most memorable and frightening non-supernatural horror movie villains.\n\nAuthor Paul Sheldon (Caan), famous for writing a series of novels set in the 19th century featuring a heroine named Misery, is badly injured in a car accident during a snowstorm in rural Colorado. Fortunately, he's rescued by a former nurse who also happens to be his \"number one fan,\" Annie Wilkes. She tells Paul that the road to hospital is blocked by snow but as the winter rolls on Paul realizes that Annie is dangerous and he is a prisoner.\n\nThe situation Paul finds himself trapped in is grim, but the film itself is not thanks to the still fresh feeling approach to the material. There are moments of dark humor peppered throughout that at times border on absurdist but are welcome breaks to the tension. They also help ground the story in the real world, where humor slips in at the strangest times in the strangest ways.\n\nAnnie and Paul are both clever and resourceful characters which really ratchets up the tension. We think one character has the upper hand, then the situation flips in a believable way. We're always rooting for Paul to outsmart Annie but we know he has his work cut out for him. Scenes of Paul's agent (Lauren Becall) in New York and the local sheriff (Richard Farnsworth) in Colorado keep the film from being claustrophobic and add to the tension as we wait for someone to figure out what has really happened to Paul.\n\nA very well played and uniquely scary scene, which also has humorous undertones, happens when Annie explains to Paul why he can't just change the ending to the last \"Misery\" book to fit the new one she is forcing him to write. Her reasoning is so clear and logical, and her disdain for being condescended to as an audience member is so intense, that it makes her all the more frightening. Tricks and plot holes won't work on her; Paul will have to be extra clever to outsmart her.\n\nPerhaps the most famous scene in Misery is the \"hobbling\" scene. Annie has discovered that Paul has broken out of his locked room and explored the house. She holds a sledgehammer and calmly and meticulously explains the purpose and method of \"hobbling.\" The scene is set to Beethoven's hypnotic \"Moonlight\" sonata, a perfect choice. There is no blood and you don't have to look hard to see the special effect, but the scene is heart pounding and shocking nonetheless. I still jump or look away every time. Overall, Misery is not an especially bloody movie which makes the few scenes of violence even more effective and shocking. Aside from the \"hobbling\" scene, maybe the most famous moment of Misery is the shot of Annie's face coming into focus as Paul regains consciousness from the car wreck. It's an unforgettable introduction.\n\nIn a rare instance of the Academy Awards recognizing and honoring horror, Bates deservedly won the Oscar for Best Actress of 1990. Annie is never really likable but thanks to Bates, she is always interesting to watch and her swings from wholesome and vulnerable to psychotic and violent are believable and frightening. Even as she tortures Paul, you still believe her affection for him is real and that's what makes her so scary. She plays Annie Wilkes to such perfection that you can't imagine the character or the movie without her.",

Sheldon finds himself trapped with multiple injuries included compound fractures to his legs meaning that he is immobile and dependent on Wilkes to care for him. She also tells him that the telephone lines and down and roads closed, both of which are lies. Things take a darker turn still when Wilkes goes and buys the latest book by Sheldon which has just been published (yes the road to town has mysteriously been reopened but there's no mention of Wilkes taking Paul to a local hospital) only to discover that her favourite character Misery has died during childbirth. Wilkes isn't happy about this. This is bad news for Sheldon. \n\nMisery explores the obsessive, irrational fan devotion that was explored in very different circumstances in Scorsese's meisterwerk The King of Comedy, a film that bombed at the box office whilst Misery was a huge hit but is inferior in comparison. Oh, the irony.\n\nBefore seeing Misery for the first time I had read and thoroughly enjoyed Stephen King's masterful novel of the same name. The film adaptation feels like the finer nuances of the novel have been erased to make a big screen shocker that contains great performances by Kathy Bates (Wilkes) and James Caan (Sheldon) with Paul's literary agent being portrayed effortlessly by the ever divine Lauren Bacall.\n\nBut the film also feels like some kind of TV movie that lacks not just the depth of King's novel but also the cinematic grandeur that might have been envisaged and realised by another director other than Rob Reiner. \n\nMisery feels like an attempt to hit big at the box office by creating two dimensional characters and cheap shocks rather than delivering anything with real intelligence. And it worked. Misery brought in the money and earned Bates an Oscar. But watch Misery next to other, better King adaptations such as The Shining and Carrie and you'll see what I mean. There's no comparison.",

I read Stephen King's \"Misery\" about a year or two ago and had never seen the film adaptation until now. I think as a whole, this is a solid adaptation of King's novel. I felt the same tension I felt reading the book and thought Kathy Bates was a perfect choice for Annie Wilkes. She is terrifying and gives a great performance that truly deserved the Oscar that she won that year. My only gripe about the movie is that the book is a more engaging way to experience this story to its fullest, while the movie is a more straightforward thrill ride. As far as adaptations go, I still feel this is one of the better ones overall, but it still suffers a bit just because of the strength of the source material. Nonetheless, it's a tense movie that kept me on the edge of my seat even though I knew how it was going to play out, and that means it does its job well.",

            "content": "Review: \n‘Misery' is an American psychological-horror film directed by Rob Reiner. It is based on Stephen King's novel of the same name. It's been a while since I seen this movie and I've got to say that I didn't love it as much as I remember I did. I mean, it's a great claustrophobic thriller with some great performances. It just didn't have the same feel it did when I first watched it years ago.\nThe plot revolves around a famous writer, Paul Sheldon (James Caan), who gets into a car wreck and is saved and seems to be nursed back to health by a woman, Annie (Kathy Bates) who claims to be his number one fan. After ready a copy of his latest release in his famous ‘Misery' book series, and finding out her favorite character was killed, Annie makes Paul write another story to bring her favorite character back to life, while also making his life a living hell.\nEverybody talks about Kathy Bates's performance in this movie, and while it is a scary and good take on Annie Wilkes, James Caan is break takingly good as the writer Paul Sheldon. In every helpless scene he is in where he is trying to escape or showing us how much pain, he is in when going in and out of his wheelchair. I was seriously in awe watching him work this character into his own creation.\nI love the camera work in this movie. I expected to because it is a Rob Reiner film, but he is so good behind a camera. He uses long and wide shots for extremely simple scenes. By that I mean it could just a be man sitting in the library looking up information and the angle he uses is so beautifully shot. Where the movie lacks is in its scare department. This is supposed to be a horror movie after all or at least a thriller, but where I see it, it's just a drama movie that has intense scenes. That's not to say the movie is bad or anything, just if your going to serve me a slice of lemon pie, make sure I taste the lemon.\nOverall, this movie shows that Stephen King is more than just a weird horror author that only writes about creepy monsters or supernatural elements. It still has a feel on a movie he would produce, but with a certain zest added to it.\n3.5/5",

            "content": "I hadn't seen this film in years and wasn't quite sure how it would hold up, but it remains a strong example of a chamber-piece horror film that excels at slow burn horror and suspense. James Caan plays romance novelist Paul Sheldon, who's in a horrific snowbound car wreck, but is \"rescued\" by his #1 fan Annie Wilkes, played by Kathy Bates in a brilliant and terrifying performance. Sheldon soon realizes his savior is in reality holding him captive, but there is little he can do due to the remoteness of her house and his wheelchair bound state. What ensues is a game of cat-and-mouse between Caan and Bates that is suspenseful, frightening, and utterly thrilling. The film is tightly directed by Rob Reiner (\"Stand by Me\" \"A Few Good Men\" \"The Princess Bride\" \"When Harry Met Sally\") and is smartly scripted by William Goldman (\"Magic\" \"Marathon Man\" and the under-appreciated \"Dreamcatcher,\" along with non-genre classics like \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" \"All the President's Men\" and \"The Princess Bride\") based on a Stephen King novel of the name. Goldman's script gets major kudos for making this chamber piece horror film believable. Sheldon is an intelligent character and Goldman has him try all of the things an intelligent person would do in order to try to escape, which makes the situation all the more terrifying. Caan is perfectly cast in the role of Sheldon, a tough guy macho on-screen personality who finds himself uncharacteristically laid low, making this plights all the more disconcerting. But it's Bates who steals the show as Sheldon's obsessed and deranged fan, determined to keep Sheldon all to herself at any cost. There are few other characters in the story, but the actors in those roles are equally memorable. Richard Farnsworth is excellent as a small-town sheriff investigating Sheldon's disappearance, as is Frances Sternhagen who plays his wife. It's also a treat to see Lauren Bacall in a small supporting role as Sheldon's publisher, but for the most part, the film is all Caan and Bates. Overall, \"Misery\" is a class act of a horror movie, which is a rare occurrence, and is essential viewing for fans King, Caan, Bates, or of horror films or thrillers in general. SPOILER ALERT! The hobbling scene still shocks today and is just as cringe inducing as ever. ",

            "content": "Horror has never been my favorite genre because I do not really have the desire to put myself through a situation that will provoke fear and pain in me. I decided to watch this film however because so many of my friends who did not like horror really enjoyed it and had a lot of praise for the performances of Kathy Bates and James Caan. I am glad that I followed their advice and decided to watch this entertaining, suspenseful little film that rests on it's central performer, Bates, who is able to deliver an Academy Award worthy performance. I would recommend this film despite it not necessarily being to my personal tastes because it absolutely achieves what a film of  it's genre should and I enjoyed it in spite of myself.\n\nWriter Paul Sheldon, James Caan, is famed for a series of novels he has written that follow the adventures of a Southern Belle called Misery Chastain. He heads to Silver Creek Lodge, a holiday town in a secluded location, to finish writing the final novel in the series in which Chastain will die. He has a horrible car crash that breaks both of his legs when driving back to New York City and finds himself in the care of suspicious nurse Annie Wilkes, Kathy Bates, who calls herself his \"Number one fan.\" He slowly realizes that Wilkes is more sinister than she initially appeared and her anger at the death of Chastain in his draft of the book leads to a horrific series of events.\n\nThe film works both as a traditional horror film with a villain being slowly revealed in the lead up to a dramatic, bloody climax and more interestingly as a commentary on the difficulties of being famous and dealing with fanatics. It is easy to be charmed by Wilkes initially because we in the audience relate to her more than we relate to the successful and famous Sheldon. We all idolize some famous person who we hope to meet and because she appears helpful and kind at first we are willing to accept the slightly creepy statements she makes about having watched Sheldon work. When she becomes a full on evil psychopath we are almost upset because she had been the person we could most identify with on screen and we were rooting for her to gain respect from a man who she so desperately wants to prove herself to.\n\nObviously Reiner is very skilled at building suspense in the scenes in which we witness Sheldon plot to murder Wilkes with various items found around the house while he keeps an eye on her in fear of her catching him. The hobbling scene is deserving of it's iconic status as everybody winces in pain when watching it and the sight of Caan sweating while rolling around in a wheelchair is surprisingly effective. These scenes were probably the least interesting to me as they felt like something out of a very traditional horror film and while I know these scenes are necessary to please the fanatics of Stephen King they felt a bit generic at times. \n\nBates completely inhabits her role as she gives a very over the top, hammy performance but she fits the tone of the film overall and is simultaneously disturbing and sad. We are convinced by her warm bedside manner and luminous smile that she is a good person and Bates makes the shift very believable as she is chilling in the soup scene. Just the sight of her face giving a wide grimace towards the end of the film is terrifying and that is a testament to Bates' power as an actress. Caan is also very good giving the less showy performance as he gives an impressive physical performance with the audience feeling his pain through every gritting of his teeth and widening of his eyes. The two together are a wonderful pairing as they have an odd chemistry of sorts with Bates being willfully disobedient of Caan's lack of interest in her and Caan seeming ill at ease throughout, we enjoy spending time in the company of these characters because these two make them so interesting and so worth watching.",

What follows is typical King fare, a psychological game of cat and mouse that ranges from the surprisingly droll to the disturbingly brutal.\nAs Stephen King adaptations go, Misery is fairly well done, a faithful if slightly pacified version of a story that naturally hooks us in. It's really elevated by two fantastic lead performances with James Caan playing captive writer Sheldon with an understated brilliance. The real stand out, however, comes from Kathy Bates (an Oscar winner for her role), who plays the unpredictable Annie with a remarkable level of complexity and realism. A subplot involving Richard Farnsworth's Sheriff meanders along, but the bulk of the film is a two-player game, complete with scenes of biting tension, sporadic violence and unnerving tenderness. Marc Shaiman's score adds a chilling touch that suits the film's slow build from the typical to the terrifying.\nThere are enough gems of excitement in Misery to keep us interested (even at a slightly stretched 107-minute run time), but the film lacks both the introspection and horror of its source material. There are moments of greatness (the famous \"hobbling\" scene springs to mind), but much of the film is approached with a heavy-handedness, never as clever nor as scary as it seems to think it is. Nevertheless, the film remains pretty much consistently entertaining, with just enough surprises to keep it afloat. \nIn the end, Misery may be rather uninspired, but it's a loyal and well-crafted adaptation of a good story, elevated by a scintillating central performance from Kathy Bates.",

The story from Stephen King is as scary and sharp as ever with King's writing. Reiner takes the cold atmosphere, cramped spaces, and helpless situation and makes it even more frightening. \n\nJames Caan adds some much needed and appreciated humor as the hilarious and sympathetic injured author held captive by his intimidating fangirl Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates). Caan keeps you entertained through his character's immense suffering and patience. He gives an underrated performance through his use of many subtle facial movements and bodily cues with his limited dialogue. I love Caan in Misery.\n\nSpeaking of which, Kathy Bates is the star here as the obsessed devotee that puts the fan in fanatic. Her portrayal is so sweet and innocent that quickly builds into some far more sinister. You'll never look at Bates the same way again after Misery.\n\nI must mention the nice supporting roles from Richard Farnsworth, Frances Sternhagen, and Lauren Bacall. Farnsworth is the quintessential small town sheriff with a quaint charm. His sincerity and intrigue adds some joy and suspense to Misery. I think The Coen Brothers must have seen Misery to inspire their similar detective in Fargo (1996). Misery is alike Fargo in its local mystery alongside the enclosed insanity of The Shining (1980).\n\nIn short, Misery is a well directed film that depicts how depraved fans can resort to if unchecked by decency. It is as upsetting and humorous as the first time I watched it. You will be rooting for Caan the entire time. So sit back and endure the pain of Misery.",

Based on a Stephen King novel, the story follows famed novelist Paul Sheldon who's rescued from a car crash by an obsessed fan; but things take a dark turn when he discovers that he's being drugged and is locked in his room.  James Caan and Kathy Bates both give strong performances; particularly Bates, who does a good job at subtly moving from eccentric fan and psychopath.  And Reiner effectively builds tension and suspense quite well; especially in showing Sheldon's captivity and isolation.  Still, there are some problems with the script, such as the underdeveloped subplot of the sheriff's investigation and the rushed conclusion.  Yet despite its flaws, Misery is a frightening horror film.",

The pacing is perfect from beginning to end and nothing feels out of place, you get just the right amount of suspense and action. The acting from the two leads is fantastic and they both help to get us sucked into every celebrity's worst nightmare. As a writer myself I especially sympathize with James Caan's character and how he is deprived of his freedom of expression and mobility just to please a psychotic and prudish fan of his (played brilliantly by Kathy Bates). Kathy's character seems to serve as a bit of a personification of fan bases in general, praising and adoring an artist's work when it meets their arbitrary, often contradictory expectations, while going crazy when that artist decides to change things up and create something that challenges his intended audience. The terror Paul Sheldon is forced to endure becomes all the more nail-biting as Annie Wilkes seemingly loses more of her sanity as the film progresses (or at least does away with the facade of sanity), and it builds up to a satisfying climax. I can't believe I hadn't seen this movie before but I'm very glad that I did! Will definitely rewatch it in the future.",

When she didn't like what happened, she goes on psycho on Paul Sheldon (James Caan) and keeps him inside her house. In his young years, Rob Reiner used to be a big deal in terms of the films that he has made, but then he starts to slips away in his films that people wonder ask, what happened to Rob Reiner? When I watch his past films to see how it came to be, even though I didn't like This Is Spinal Tap, I come to a realization that he just surrounded himself with talented writers that know how to write a film, whether it be from Aaron Sorkin for A Few Good Men and The American President, Nora Ephron for When Harry Met Sally..., and William Goldman for The Princess Bride, and this movie. James Caan did a great job acting like a calm person trying to go through with the situation that he's in, while dealing with the pain of his legs. Kathy Bates did a fantastic job of her performance as a big fan of the author that is nice in one hand, but the other way she goes complete crazy, and also get depressed too in one scene, which I'm glad she got the Academy Award for it. The writing by William Goldman is really good that understands how scary people can be when they are a bit too obsessed with who they enjoy reading their books. It gets pretty tense at times as you really want the author to get out of her house despite his legs being in pain, and it can be hard to watch at times, but in a good way that makes you more invested in this. There were some moments that I was disinterested, but I still had a great time watching this film that it's one of the creepiest Stephen King adaptations that I've seen.",

Kathy Bates plays one of the scariest renditions of that one in-law in recent history. It lacks the depth of the original book, which is mostly unavoidable with the transfer from book to movie, but it also lacks the build of the book, meaning that the climax is unfortunately truncated and we don't get to establish a relatively normal relationship between our protagonist and antagonist before things get tense. But it is still TENSE.

Some of my favourite things about this movie are the performances and the screenplay. James Caanes and Kathy Bates are both oscar worthy ( Kathy Bates won her one and only oscar and it sucks james caanes didnt even get nominated because he really deserved it) i did like the writing and direction but i could have felt that Kathy bates could have been written or directed a little bit differently, because for a movie that is near 2 hours long which isnt a bad thing, you have to have good characters, even if the movie isn't two hours long, you have to have good characters. Even though both stars had good characters i feel like kathy bates should have been a little less tempermental becausr it got kind of annoying, yet effective, so i don't really know how to feel about that. It really is a love hate thing with kathy bates because she had an outstanding performance, but there was just somthing about the writing. The death sequence, when she fell on the type writer i felt thats when she should have died, she was literally pooling blood out of her head, then she gets back up and tried to kill james caanes once again. that isn't a strong female character trait that she got back up, that is just unrealistic and i suppose that is the writers and the directors fault, but it's okay. I didn't hate that, i would have just prefered if it had a little bit more realism. If the movie as a whole had just a tad bit more realism, i think it would have been at a 5 star level. also, if the score/soundrack were better, that would help the movie alot too. Anyways, Misery was a good movie that i enjoyed alot and it is another great stephen king book-to-film adaptation and i was really impressed by it and had a good time watching it. I reccomend this if you haven't seen Misery yet.",

There are obvious differences; in \"The Shining\" of course the writer is the one who goes crazy, there are numerous supernatural elements that aren't present in \"Misery\", and \"Misery\" doesn't exactly have the visual or philosophical depth that Kubrick brought to \"The Shining\".\n\nStill, Rob Reiner's film is a very entertaining and often terrifying study of obsession, and its simplistic themes about Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates)' over-infatuation with Paul Sheldon (James Caan) still have a lot of relevance today in our age of fandoms and #Cut4Zayn / #Cut4Bieber. \n\nKathy Bates won the Oscar for her performance - the only Oscar ever won for a movie based on a Stephen King work - and so it's no surprise that her performance is hauntingly effective. James Caan is also great in his role as the writer. His performance is mainly physical, as many scenes are devoted to him trying to escape his imprisonment (Wilkes takes him in after he crashes his car during a snow storm, and pretends to \"care\" for him before forcing him to write her a new book to her liking). \n\nIt's a well-edited and nicely framed movie, though most of the entertainment value is down to the bare-bones, quickly-paced script and the committed performances from the leads. Richard Farnsworth and Frances Sternhagen are also great as the local sheriff and his wife, respectively, who attempt to figure out where Paul has gone after he's declared missing. The comic rapport between the two characters reminded me a bit of the characters played by Frances McDormand and John Carroll Lynch in \"Fargo\", though with a slightly more sarcastic tone.

            "content": "Wow, has Misery really been around for almost 25 years? It is a superb story of an author who gets in a bad car accident and then is dragged to \"safety\" by his his #1 fan. This is one of those films that I wish I could have seen without knowing anything about it, because that gradual turn the story takes from a simple drama into an all-out thriller is very subtle. It is such a great slow burn as you actually realize along with Paul Sheldon, that perhaps Annie Wilkes isn't his savior. In fact my only real complaint is that, when you know what's coming, it can seem like it is taking too long to get there. But once Annie shows her darker side the tension is heightened in every single scene. One of my favorite aspects is the fact that Paul over time starts to understand how Annie's mind works and he uses that knowledge to manipulate her into doing things she might not have anyways. It is a very unusual relationship because it starts out so gentle from both sides and in her mind the gentleness never goes away despite his growing paranoia, anger, and fear.\n\nJames Caan delivers an excellent performance as Paul Sheldon. I'm always complimenting actors when they perform in such a way that we can tell just through expression what they're thinking, and this is one of those times when it is nearly flawless. I also had to continue reminding myself that he was just pretending to be crippled because he did a great job of dragging his legs around like they were broken. Of course the real master stroke of Misery is Kathy Bates. Holy cow, does she ever deliver a terrifying performance. In those later scenes she says some things in the sweetest tone you can imagine and yet they give me the chills because I can feel the underlying threat. This might be one of the best films adapted from a Stephen King novel. If you have not seen Misery, hopefully I haven't spoiled it too much for you, because this is one I would recommend you check out. It still holds up 25 years later, because the story of obsession is somewhat timeless.",

You were never sure when the \"Dragon Lady\" would appear or what she would do. You weren't really sure how much she knew about Paul's schemes. I loved the camera work. Especially the voyeuristic shots that give you an unsettling feeling of anticipation and impending doom from putting you in her perspective before you know for sure that it is her perspective. I love the parallel scenes of Paul panicking not to get caught by Annie and then Annie panicking not to get caught by the Sheriff.

A lot of great actors turned down the role of Paul Sheldon, before James Caan accepted. All credits must go to the wonderful performance of Kathy Bates, a the psychotic Annie Wilkes. She won an Academy Award and Golden Globe for best Actress. Enjoy the movie, and remember: Not all friendly faces are trustworthy... \n\nSuccessful author of the Misery Chastain-series Paul Sheldon (Caan) has been staying at a remote lodge in the snowy mountains, waiting for the release of his latest book and working on a new manuscript. Heading home he is surprised by a blizzard and crashes with his car. When Paul regains consciousness, he finds himself in a bed with his wounded legs and shoulder taken care of by a nurse called Annie Wilkes (Bates), who rescued him. Because of the heavy snow, she took him to her house. As gratitude and because Annie claims to be his number one fan, he lets her read his new manuscript. The woman admits she doesn't like it as much as the 'Misery'-books. When the following day Annie comes home from shopping, she has brought a copy of Paul's latest book. Excited she starts to read it.  But when Annie learns that her favorite character dies in the end, she's in a total rage. Paul is no longer her patient. He's her prisoner...",

He does add an enjoyable subplot of the local sheriff looking for Sheldon, played by the always appealing Richard Farnsworth.

The shocking way she flips back and fourth between a sweet girl and a total psycho is incredible. It's always disturbing when she's around, and Bates' performance is worth nothing short of an Academy Award. It's no surprise she won.\nJames Caan makes an exquisite comeback in Misery, and as a character who has to act physically disabled and mentally tortured simultaneously, Caan succeeds in his role extremely well. He uses good vocal skill and line delivery in his dialogue scenes, as well as proper physical skill in his scenes that require use of character disability. Misery features one of Caan's best performances.\n\nA contributing factor to the success of Misery is the utter intensity and musical score, as well as the character development and the simplicity of the plot. It's also thrilling thanks to the sense of realism and the plot dynamics used to characterise the characters. Misery is a great and unforgettable thriller, and one of the better Steven King based films.",

I don't usually like the horror genre, unless it's something interesting and justifies its gore. This adaptation is more ironical, sardonic and absurdist than you would hope to find in a Stephen King film. That was something I particularly liked, whereas other films like Kubrick's \"The Shining\" are awfully accelerated and its impredictability doesn't reach a more monumental glance after you've first seen it. Or at least, that's what I think of it :P\n\nMy mom loves this kind of films and we saw it some days ago, after hearing some unbelievable lauds towards Kathy Bates' performance. Maybe it's me, but I laughed so hard everytime she talked or appeared. Not that she wasn't scary, she was just so over the top. I loved the way she yelled at Paul Sheldon calling him \"Mr. Man\", and how she changed on her attidue towards him was just as hilarious as frightening. A fine job indeed. However, I happen to like James Caan's performance more than Bates'. He was the man who played Sonny Corleone, for godssakes!\n\nI don't understand why Stephen King chooses to kill secondary characters so often. I also found the film unnecesarily too rude and disrespecting with several of its characters: why should all fans be stigmatized because there was one crazy bitch who forced the writer to keep her favourite fantasy alive? Now nobody can tell him \"I'm your favorite fan\", 'cause then the instant image of Annie Wilkies comes to mind. James Caan's face when he replies \"Thanks, I appreciate it\" is pricelessly descriptive. He should have been nominated for an Oscar back in 1990, for he did a job as grand as Al Pacino did in the last Godfather.\n\nNeedless I say, \"Misery\" is a hugely entertaining horror flick that relies in psychological subtlety to transmit its horror, and actually seems more consistent and surprising everytime you see it again.",

The elements are all in place to be claustrophobic and have an appropriate amount of thrills, and even to show the situations that can arise when fans go too far.

The obvious standout is Kathy Bates' Oscar-winning turn as the psychotic and slightly tragic Annie Wilkes, a bubbly celebrity stalker prone to severe mood swings and a vicious mean streak.  Her unreal cheeriness clearly disguises something, so from the moment she appears, there's a feeling of tension.  The cheery facade is quite thin though, and the devil within bubbles up unpredictably, yet the viewer is unlikely to be entirely unsympathetic toward her severe depression.  James Caan plays her victim, and even as his performance rarely leaves a bed or a wheelchair, he conveys his character's plight effectively.  An unfortunately less remembered performance is Richard Farnsworth as the local sheriff investigating the disappearance of Cann's character, who provides a healthy amount of wry humor to the dark proceedings.  Also of note is the chilling cinematography by Barry Sonnenfeld, especially as the shots focus on Bates' face during her wrathful tantrums.  William Goldman, who wrote the script, was originally most excited to have Bates chop off Caan's feet with an ax in the infamous \"hobbling\" scene, but while plenty of feet have been seen cut off, the image of a sledgehammer knocking a foot well out of a natural position is not easily forgotten.",

Driving home from a hotel in Colorado, his car crashes and he is found by a former nurse, Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates) who happens to be his number one fan. The phones are down, and it seems that no help is coming any time soon, despite the work of dedicated Sheriff Buster (Richard Farnsworth).\r\n\r\nKathy Bates won an Oscar for this film, and she deserved it. Annie is a terrifying creation, even when pleasant. ESPECIALLY when pleasant. The film is primarily a psychological battle between Annie and the incapacitated Sheldon, which quickly tuns physical when Annie gets violent.\r\n\r\nAll the acting is quite good, really. Caan is a magnificent straight man for Kathy Bates to play off of, and Richard Farnsworth is pretty delightful in his scenes. They add a light, gentle comedy to contrast with the horror and dark humor in the rest of the film.\r\n\r\nThere's also nice pacing to this film, never needing to go back when it escalates. There is a mystery to who Annie is, and it's nicely told without being explicitly stated. Also, there is a pig.\r\n\r\nIf anything could be said against the film, it's mainly that it's an extremely simple story. It doesn't take very many risks, and there are no real big surprises. The film grows a little ridiculous at the end as well, and... I really wanted more Buster.\r\n\r\nAll in all, a taut, fun, thrilling thriller. Sure, it doesn't really do anything new, but what it does do it does extremely well. How many modern day thrillers can say the same?",

Like Caan, Bates' character isn't exactly three-dimensional or one that we totally ever care about, but she nevertheless succeeds at being awkward and strange most of time, creating some truly unforgettably uncomfortable moments. \"Misery\" dwindles into predictable horror territory towards the end, but it's an enjoyable flick that's equal parts thriller and dark comedy.",

I know that sentence sounds a bit paradoxical, but allow me to explain; from what I had heard from friends and others, this was a piece of cinema that was groundbreaking and perfect in every sense. When I saw it, I wasn't blown away like I had expected, and this may have affected how I viewed it - I was expecting so much that I was never going to be fully sated by what was on screen, and that is my fault. Yet, this was one of the most solid and interesting films I've ever seen; directed by Rob Reiner, the man behind cult film Spinal Tap and the amazing Stand By Me, starring James Caan and Kathy Bates, it's the perfect tale of a person stranded with an enemy. What makes the film more than a simple moral tale, however, is the fact that we, as an audience, identify with Bates' character, even though we know she's a murderer and insane - we understand her lonliness, her isolation and her hunger for company, and we understand that Caan is the person to replace her husband. The atmosphere is intense and spooky throughout and, although not much in the way of gore or murder occurs, the menacing tone just never shifts - Bates' character is so unhooked and insane that her mood changes may come at anytime and, watching it for the first time, you're scared by when it might come. It's an amazing and impressive work, increased in spectacle by the dramatic turns by both leads and a solid adaptation of the Stephen King novel.",

Two moments that really stand out to me are when Caan gives Bates the finger and when Bates is snorting like a pig. Great moments. Bit of a major continuity issue with the penguin during the dinner scene. I was not happy about that. Overall, it is a good movie, but I didn't leave it thinking it was particularly amazing.

The film is absolutely solid, keeping the tension raised throughout and watching Annie's mood turn on a dime is quite exhilarating!

He always writes his books while staying the same motel in a secluded town. After he finished his latest book, he is returning back to New York when a blizzard has just started. He loses control of his car and tumbles down a cliff. Anne Wilkes (Kathy Bates), his self proclaimed #1 fan rescues and takes him back to her house and nurses his wounds. Except that she has no intention of letting him go and after she finds out he has killed off the main character in her favorite series, she burns the book and makes him to write the character back to life. Helpless and people assuming him to be dead, there is little hope that he would ever be found.\r\nMore than Kathy Bates, I was thrilled by James Caan's performance. Those subtle expressions of disappointment, deceit and sarcasm are priceless. Also liked the entertaining thread involving the aged couple who also are the Chief and Deputy of police for the town who are investigating the missing writer's case. Kathy Bates does a terrific job but her character at times is a little overcooked. The gory depiction of torture and suffering is a sight to behold. For a movie that has just two central characters, screenplay has to be perfect and perfect it is.\r\nWhat was so good here:\r\n1. Performance of James Caan and occasionally Kathy Bates.\r\n2. Entertaining thread involving the aged cop couple.\r\n3. When Anne Wilkes becomes the torturer.\r\nThrilling entertainment and Sonny did learn not to talk when he should be listening.",

The script by William Goldman is smart and sticks closely enough to the book to please King's fans. \r\nIt's basically a two-person show, and Goldman has created two very real characters here that are played to perfection by two veteran actors. James Caan is very sympathetic and easy to root for, but he's shown up every step of the way by Oscar winner Kathy Bates. This is the performance of her distinguished career. As psychopath Annie Wilkes, she gives what could have been a standard role depth and emotion. There's a lot more going on with her than meets the eye, and both actors bring a touch of class to this project.\r\nThen there's the direction by Rob Reiner, who is not at all accustomed to this type of film. He's made more than a few missteps in his career, but he's at the top of his game here. The suspense builds to the breaking point, and while the film does rely on a few cheap shocks near the end, it's still solid entertainment. The supporting performances by Richard Farnsworth and Frances Sternhagen bring a sense of realism to the picture with their down-to-earth appeal, and cinematographer-turned-director Barry Sonnenfeld's striking work here make this such a beautiful looking picture as well. It's work like this that made his move to the director's chair such a natural transition.\r\nWatching \"Misery\" made me wish that everyone involved with this film could go back and remake every other Stephen King adaptation before it. This is how it should be done.",

One of the major problems is that this movie doesn't leave much of an impression - especially if you've read the original book and thus know everything that's going to happen. The plot twists are a little bit too convenient and the ending is kind of meh. So why do I like this one? Well, the acting is extremely solid for one thing. Kathy Bates won an Oscar for her role and it shows, though I must admit that some of her screaming scenes were a little over the top. James Caan was also very good in his role, I liked him the most. Furthermore the story is of course captivating, the cinematography is good and all in all the whole movie seems to flow really well. So yeah, it's nothing overly great, but it's good.",

Its not the type of movie you would expect someone that age to really like but I had to watch it every time it came on.  I'm not sure what it was about this film that fascinated me;  maybe it was the thought of how someone could so desperately cling to fictional characters that they would violently lash out at anyone who harmed them.  I didn't realize until I was much older that this is not as uncommon an occurrence in everyday life.  I guess if any work of fiction triggers emotion in you then you have to wonder how much crazier Annie Wilkes is than any of us.      \n\n And The hobbling scene is no less graphic 20 years later.

            "content": "Hey, more Stephen King movies that actually work!\n\nAt first I was like \"well, why did the guy who made 'This is Spinal Tap' make a thriller\"...and then I was \"oh my god. This is actually a really well-made thriller.\"\n\nInstead of relying on jump scares, which were starting to be heavily abused by most mainstream horror films, Reiner instead uses a more classic Hitchcockian way of scaring the wits out of the viewer. From the first minute you see Annie Wilkes, you know that Sonny Corleone is in deep, deep trouble. I blame Marc Shaiman's score for causing us to feel extremely tense - it's as if we're transported back to classic filmmaking, save for a few more swears and some extremely disturbing violence at the end.\n\nPlot: Paul Sheldon (James Caan) gets into a pretty nasty car accident, worrying his agent and his unseen daughter. He's saved by Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates), a livestock farmer who claims to be his #1 fan. Thinking she's sort of well reserved, Paul allows her to read his new manuscript (a little darker than the seemingly implied romantic tripe of the Misery novels). From there, oh boy...if I tell you that Annie doesn't really like Paul's new direction and wants him to write his new novel (to the point where she's willing to keep him trapped in her house under all circumstances), that would be an understatement of the highest order.\n\nFrom there, Annie wants Paul to write a new Misery novel - more absurd than the original, with gun duels and corpse resurrections and every trope you would find in a Stephen King novel. Paul does so, thinking that if he tries to defy her under any circumstances, he would instantly be killed. Annie, knowing that Paul's trying to get away from her, constantly drugs him in order to keep him in check. However, her plan to keep Paul forever doesn't exactly work.\n\nI think one of the more effective parts of the film in the acting. Yeah, cinematography is standard (nothing too stereotypically artsy or definitive of Rob Reiner's style - unless if you count making an exaggeration of real life his style), but it's the performances that got to me. Caan doesn't get much love in this film - after all, compared to Bates' all out and just downright demented performance as Annie Wilkes, he's extremely reserved - but in that regard, he plays a writer who's trying desperately trying to get away from the desires of his fans. Hell, even by writing this extremely terrible novel that satisfies this woman who thinks everything he writes is gold, you know Paul's up to something. You want him to get out and when he does, you ask yourself, \"Was it worth it? Yeah, Annie killed babies, colleagues, and the sheriff, but after all, she's human. Nobody deserves to die by the hand of another. Was Paul truly justified when he slowly bludgeoned Annie to death?\"\n\n...and on the flip side, I adore Kathy Bates' performance. At first a Marge Gunderson type who appears as if she walked off the set of \"Fargo,\" she slowly becomes insane. Like, \"what if La Tenia and Biff Tannen had a baby with Norman Bates and Phillip Garrido\" insane. All she wants is to love Paul. All she wants him is to abide to a set of standards that he clearly does not want to stand to. She wants him to bring solace to her life. She clearly cannot separate fantasy and reality - when Misery dies, her life's over. It's back to the big bad world that has disowned her because of her sordid past. She wants Paul to keep her in this state of disorientation so she can continue her fantasy life. Hell, it's somewhat implied that she's probably raped Paul. She clings to the guy - and she's deeply in love with him. Every time he asks her for a dinner with her, it's obvious that she swoons over him. Also, why is she constantly drugging him with painkillers and whatever that stuff is in that syringe?\n\nHowever, like most good films, this suffers from a bit of pacing problems. Also, we're not really given much insight as to what Paul's daughter felt during those four weeks he had been captured. I know everybody thinks he's dead, but at least show us Paul's daughter reacting to that obviously misleading news. Then again, that could be the case - after all, we're solely focused on Paul and the sheriff as his curiosity piques thanks to some evidence everybody else doesn't see. \n\nIn summary, though, \"Misery\" is a great film. Like most great Stephen King adaptations, this adds another dimension to the film - instead of making it solely about the problems with a rabid fanbase when they disapprove of a newer and better direction for somebody's work and a critique of wingnut Christianity (unable to accept the reality of their situation), this movie also adds a bit of an \"abandon all hope\" feel. It shows imprisonment - it gets you imprisoned. You want people to help, but you don't get help. In order to get things your own way, you have to force it. However, is forcing it really worth it?",
