I can't quite put this in my personal top ten films list of all time but perhaps in my top twenty, lol. An absolute classic from the crime/drama genre in my opinion. I appreciated it way more than The Godfather as well as other films from similar genres. I believe this could be mostly because I grew up in the 80s and 90s, I suppose. But I think also is just my personal preference really. Of course, Miller's Crossing is not the same movie experience as The Godfather at all really, lol. Different era and probably due to the Coen Brothers as well. In fact, I can't compare it to anything else really. Overall, is thoroughly enjoyable and is one of the better films from the 90s in my humble opinion. Great performances from an ensemble cast as well.",

            "content": "Coen Hammett\n\nThis 1990 neo- noir by the Coen brothers is their twisted version of Dashiell Hammett's The Glass Key. In both tales, the wise advisor to the cities' mob boss crosses over to the 'other side' when his cautious council is ignored by the boss for 'personal' reasons. Then all hell breaks loose, and the Coen's treatment of the story becomes it's own weird morality tale.\n\nThe script crackles, the acting fizzes (especially Jon Torturro's Bernie Birnbaum), the camera dances and the story unfolds (not entirely 100% airtight, but good enough). The music is beautiful and so are the set pieces. Fixer Gabriel Byrne's Tom Reagan (the good cops' first name married to the bad cops' surname in the Maltese Falcon) gets the s**t kicked out of him throughout the story but outsmarts everyone in the final analysis. The ending carries a bit of the Glass Key and Chandler's Long Goodbye. You can't know or trust anyone. He saves boss Albert Finney, but loses the girl they shared.\n\nI love this movie, forgiving it's chilly pessimism and slightly incredible script. It is not a B movie, but an A- movie, notable for nearly everything. It's one of the best noirs, despite being in colour and made 40 years later.",

            "content": "The world seems like a cruel, unjust place where nothing good ever happens. But then Steve Buscemi shows up in a Coen Brothers movie. \n\nMiller's Crossing is the quietly popular Coen film, in that it's got name recognition but often ends up filed as one of many decent crime films of its era, when in reality for longtime fans of the filmmaking duo or the genre this projects ranks among the very best. Filled with the Coens' classic distinctive character design, snappy dialogue, and great period stylings, the film is an homage to the gangster and noir classics (and not exclusively American ones, either) that gave rise to the premise. Gabriel Byrne (who I have to keep reminding myself is not a serious version of Glenn Howerton) is caught in a web of dueling loyalties at the center of the Prohibition-era crime world, relying on deception and smooth talking to gradually pit larger forces against one another while the risk of death waits around each corner. The film is a bit narratively dense with its several crossed wires, but it's absolutely worth it to see John Turturro's classic pleading for his life, or Albert Finney turn the tables on a pair of Thompson-wielding assassins. \n\nAnd through it all, the actions of our antihero protagonist take the status quo back to where it was. There's a bleakness and a beauty in that sentiment. (4.5/5)",

            "content": "Miller's Crossing – A Different Take \n\nYet another stylish but relatively empty Cohen Bros study of the wretchedly brutal lives of worthless underworld gangsters.  Direction, characters, and dialogue are as measured as they are familiar and seem to be copying many gangster flicks that went before it. Take away the obviously slick scene-set ups and it's just a shell that's strung together in order to cram in as many killings, bashings, and double-crosses as three or four other movies just like it.  \n\nThe movie's main character (Byrne) is somewhat like a cartoon character who gets knocked down several flights of stairs, bashed so badly (and often) that it's amazing he can ever stand again but the next day he's on the street looking fresh as a daisy. The only wound ever visibly inflicted is a cracked lip (that he's had since the movie started!). It's all reminiscent of a Sergio Lorne spaghetti western, the type these moviemakers would have grown up watching. \n\nFans will not see the flaws through being blinded by the trendy stylistics but judging by the poor box-office returns, many others were not being so fooled. Carter Burwell's score, adapted from a Celtic classic is most effective but deserves a better subject. The last scene, this time reminiscent of a far better Carol Reed classic, also features a Hat scene that looks like it belonged in a dark, Disney remake of the story of Johnny Fedora and Alice Blue Bonnet. A good cast wasted in more over the top nasty silliness.",

The plot is complex, the period details are impeccable, the dialogue is quotable, Barry Sonnenfeld's cinematography is beautiful, and the performances are top-notch, especially by John Turturro as the catalyst for the conflict and Marcia Gay Harden as the love interest.

            "content": "An enthralling journey into the shadowy underworld of treachery.\n\nJoel Coen's direction for his neo-noir crime drama Miller's Crossing (1990) is drenched in nighttime mood and uneasy atmosphere. \n\nYou never quite know where Joel and Ethan Coen's story will go in Miller's Crossing. The Coen Brothers' writing leaves you gripped by each moment with turncoats and snitches everywhere. They show how the criminal world never has ethics truly because if someone did, they'd surely die for their honesty. Ethics and virtues are for the lawful as everyone else is corrupt and cynical in Miller's Crossing. It's not just a place in the film where dead bodies can be hidden, but a reference to the main character Tom Reagan's endless string of double crosses. \n\nGabriel Byrne is fantastic and subtle with his performance as Tom. You can always tell what he's thinking by his expressive face, while you can never guess what he'll do next either. Miller's Crossing unfolds like a crime mystery that you're constantly getting pieces to put together of what life is like on the other side of the law. Albert Finney is phenomenal as Leo O'Bannon with his surefire temper and quiet ruling of the Irish mob and rackets in the city. When he unloads lead with a tommy gun is one of the greatest action sequences ever captured on film. Jon Polito steals every scene as the goofy and short tempered Italian mob boss Johnny Casper.\n\nMarcia Gay Harden is a no frills lady who doesn't take any hits without retribution in Miller's Crossing named Verna Bernbaum. It's all for her love of her awful brother Bernie Bernbaum, played hilariously and sinisterly by John Turturro. His tearful begging for his life never fails to make me laugh, while his turn into a selfish rat is highly entertaining. J.E. Freeman is super intimidating as the peerless henchman with great suspicions named Eddie Dane. Steve Buscemi cameos as Mink, who is involved with fixed fights. The cronies Frankie (Mike Starr) and Tic-Tac (Al Mancini) are a riot as they and everyone else beats up Gabriel Byrne every few minutes. Sam Raimi and Olek Krupa have nice cameos, but Frances McDormand has the best cameo as the mayor's sweet secretary.\n\nMichael R. Miller's editing cuts when needed with a flashy style that makes Miller's Crossing a quick feeling 115 minutes. Barry Sonnenfeld's cinematography is gorgeou with these seedy and dark looking wide shots outside. His close-ups and medium shots are so focused and compelling. Dennis Grassner's production design looks like the prohibition era America with Nancy Haigh's period accurate and lavish furnishings for Miller's Crossing's set decoration. Carter Burwell's score is dreamy with a stark gravitas to his melodic masterpiece. Richard Hornung's costumes look cool and striking on every man and woman. Katherine James' make-up artistry ensures each actor and actress in Miller's Crossing has never looked better. I've never seen Gabriel Byrne so handsome or Marcia Gay Harden and Frances McDormand look so pretty.\n\nIn all, The Coen Brothers have humor and violence aplenty with enough drama to ensnare any viewer into their lively world of crime.",

My favorite scene was when they go to the cite where Tommy supposedly killed Bernie and they believe he carried out the deed as there was a body but no recognizable face. That scene shows how in that time period they would use doubles and how some actions you make may benefit you later on. I rate this film 4 stars because it would capture the action at great speeds and would always keep you watching and questioning who truly had the most power. The characters would keep their accent throughout the whole film and their actions would also present how the mobs would be in the city trying to retain control.",

            "content": "The film, Miller's Crossing follows an Irish mob member named Tom. After a confrontation in the office of well-known Irish mob leader named Leo, who denied an Italian Mob Leader, Johnny Caspar, the opportunity to kill a double-crossing bookie, named Bernie. The main reason Leo said no to the killing of Bernie, was that Leo is dating Bernie's sister, Verna. In addition to dating Leo, Verna is also seeing Tom on the side which forces him to switch from Leo's mob to Johnny Caspar's mob once he admits this to Leo. This switch then creates a change in how the mob's are run. Caspar puts all of his faith in Tom now that he joined the Italian mafia, causing a change in who's giving Caspar the advice in listening to his lessons on how to run a mob and in life lessons. Tom's switch in mobs also causes many escalations in the gang wars, causing a shift in power over which mob runs the unnamed town. \n\nMy favorite scene from the movie begins near the 40 minute mark when two members from Caspar's mob are sent to Leo's home to kill him. The reason why this is my favorite scene from the movie is because of how cool Leo is in this scene. The scene starts off with the mobsters setting the lower level of his house on fire and the two mobsters began to creep up the stairs. Leo meanwhile, was sitting on his bed blasting the song Danny Boy, which happens to be a popular Irish funeral song. Leo notices the smoke rising through the floorboards of his room, which would frighten most people. However, what makes this scene is that Leo climbs under his bed to shoot the one mobster in the leg and then in the head to steal his gun. This is important because this then starts an escape from his room while his house is burning. Shortly after he escapes the room he then starts a shootout with the living mobster and kills him after the mobster gets shot multiple times, all of this goes on while the Funeral Song is blasting in the background. Which makes this scene very ironic because we hear this classical music being played while a violent shootout is occurring. This scene also has a lot of ramifications for the entire film as it proves that Leo still runs the town. Caspar thought his gang was on the rise and sometimes thought they ran the town, but Leo's dominance proves him wrong and shows he's still got it. \n\nI would give this film a 4 out of 5. The reason I would give the film this ranking is because it was really written and those subtle pieces of comedy that is why I enjoyed the film. I'm very particular about what type of mob movies a lot and this specific movie brought back memories and reminded me of the movie, The Irishman. Especially when Tom was delegated the role of killing Bernie. Tom was receiving instructions from Tic-Tac and Frankie on how to kill Bernie was very similar to the Irishman when Robert De Niro's character was explaining the instructions given to him in the movie. What I really enjoyed about the film was the convoluted relationships between each character and how they tie into the mobs and which side they were on. These relationships between the characters keeps the audience interested in the film. I only have two issues with the film which is why I would give it a 4 out of 5. Despite it being a major component in my favorite scene, I feel the violence was a tad bit over-shown in the movie. I understand that the violence shown was common throughout the time period this movie takes place in. I thought maybe it could've shown the aftermath of the violent event sometimes like other films rather than showing the violent act in progress. The only other complaint I have is with the convoluted relationships I mentioned earlier, unless you are 100% dialed into the film, the relationships can get really confusing and the audience can get lost really quickly. That being said, by creating these complicated situations, the Coen Brothers actually make the audience watch the entirety of the film and pay attention so that they can understand the plot of the movie. Which on the Coen Brothers part is really smart. Overall, I highly recommend watching this movie as I think this is underrated among mob movie films.",

Tommy is stalwart to the Gang boss Leo when trouble strikes with the rival gang that is led by Casper who competes for Leo's power over the city. After a few strategic clandestine plays that Tommy makes to get into the head of Casper and gain his trust, Tommy is finally able to bring down this rival gang and its leader, by leading Casper to Tommy's house for Tommy to wack Casper until he is confronted with a familiar face which Is Bernie who he spared from shooting on in his brain at the forest. Bernie ends up killing Casper and is square with Tommy until Tommy decides to kill Bernie also so that the crime does not trace back to him. One of the most Iconic scenes that occurred in this movie was when Leo almost got surprised attacked by 4 of Capsers men at his own house, Leo ends up winning this 1 vs 4 in a glorious and thrilling way which just makes the movie better as a whole.

It left an indelible expression on me because not only did he barge in there without a care in a world but in front of many girls who could've have snitched on them to Leo but he didn't care. It also really showed how Verna was so reticent because when she saw him enter she looked shocked and kind of scared asking what he was doing there she definitely didn't want no one to know.",

There are a lot of double crossings between friends or you can even say frenemies and maybe that's why the film is called Miller's CROSSINGS.

I rate this film a 5, since it had romance, drama, action, and a little bit of action.",

The film stars Gabriel Byrne as Tom Reagan and Albert Finney as Leo O Bannon. \n\nThe actors in the film I personally think fit the characters really well. The acting is also really strong especially John Turturro as Bernie Bernbaum I felt that he gave a really good performance of a scared but twisted bookie.\n\nThe characters are written really well and are also really enjoyable to watch. The characters are also very memorable including the ones that only appear for a couple scenes. \n\nThe cinematography is strong with some great shots from start to finish. The cinematography also fits with the colour scheme of the film whether it be a slow scene of a fast paced scene.\n\nI personally very much like the mob setting from the bleak tone to the way the characters all interact. \n\nThe set design and props are very good and fit with the film near perfectly.\n\nThe costume design in my opinion is so close to being perfect, but sadly there was one scene where one of the extras was wearing something that didnt fit with the other characters.\n\nThe style of the film is strong with its colour scheme to its pacing. \n\nThe practical effects are done really well from the shooting of guns to the way the blood is done.\n\nThe action in the film is directed and pulled off extremely well. One scene in particular was a scene where they play the song Danny boy.\n\nThe dialogue in the film is very sound and quotable like the line What heart?\n\nThe editing is steady with some cool edits now and again.\n\nThe music in the film was by Carter Burwell. The music I personally really like and I also think that it fits really Well with the film. \n\nThe story was very good and enjoyable to watch fold out. What made the story even better was the characters and acting.\n\nThe film does also have some comedy which I found quiet funny especially one scene in which Tom is left alone in a room with someone els from an apposing mob. \n\nThe film also has some very good atmosphere at points especially toward the end. \n\nThe film in my opinion is really enjoyable and one that I will be watching again.\n\nThe film does have a couple things wrong with it luckily it doesnt take away away that much.\n\nOver all I give it a 9/10 - so close",

            "content": "Probably the best Coen Brothers film ever made, but for reasons beyond my understanding no critics or fans will ever give it that kind of deserved praise - most likely because we're too emotionally invested in quotable lines from Lebowski or Burn After Reading - but at the end of the day, even the Coen Brothers \"lesser\" films that aren't universally loved as much as others are almost without question better than 99% of the rest of the films released in any given year. So what I'm saying is rating their best works out of a catalogue of consistently stellar films is the most tedious splitting of hairs. \n  \nThe overwhelming awe packed into overhead shots and panning landscapes of nothingness to serve as characters themselves, along with many other signature traits in their work, is enough to make any film great at the 5 minute mark. Better than what James Cameron has ever done with his billions of dollars in overrun budgets and absurdly self-centered production approach - for one example. Never forget that the James Cameron won Best Picture with Titanic over Good Will Hunting, and somehow still has the power to get all the backing he wants to make FOUR (unsolicited) Avatar sequels in 3-D, (also something no one asked for as we are no longer in the year 2004 anymore and no 3-D film has ever looked better than its regularly projected counterpart...but I digress). \n  \nMiller's Crossing is a great film that is as hard to follow as my review's thoughts are - though Crossing doesn't rant and complain about how awful James Cameron is for no reason, it does leave you wanting to start it again the moment it's over. And also you'll stop & rewind scenes some times like 5 times (John Tuturro is a force majeure in a supporting role that makes you wonder how the same man also played that guy with writer's block in the ever-relevant satire commentary noir film Barton Fink, where the movie making industry is a living hell and you're only hope for getting out alive just might be the the friendliest man you'll ever meet who gift wraps severed human heads - among other things - for his blue collar line of work we're so used to ;) Watch Miller's Crossing & burn every James Cameron movie you find in life after reading this review.",

I do think, however, this movie somehow missed the mark of rising to the level of the Godfather, Goodfellas and the other triumphs of the genre. Do not get me wrong, this is still a great film. I cannot, however, shake the feeling that it could have maybe made it to the giants, if only a couple things had been different. \n\nThe acting is top notch. Albert Finney really shines as Leo, a gruff untouchable gang boss. Jon Tolinto also does an excellent job of playing Leo's rival, Caspar. I think in a lesser actor's hands this part could have been a real miss. Caspar is an over the top manic sociopath that Tolinto captures well. Gabriel Bryne also does an excellent job as the lead. The action sequences are also stylistically brilliant and captivating. One element that the Coen Brothers have always had a real knack for is a tight and well executed visual style. Moments of brutal violence are used with authority, and the action plays out with a deft hand. \n\nMy real criticism of the film, and I feel this is maybe an odd thing to say, but it tries too hard. The dialogue is too punchy, quick and witty. There are so many good exchanges and memorable lines, but they become almost overwhelming. The characters really lose some punch as the show drags on. They stop being characters and become caricatures. The sets are also beautiful and immaculate, but, again, almost too much so. You almost feel like the characters are self-aware that they are staring in a big movie set. \n\nI sense this was maybe by design to make the film a bit of a parody on this iconic genre. I am not sure that part of the film works. The film has so many excellent purist moments. The showdown at the end between Tom and Bernie, the long walk into the woods. I appreciated some of the flair of the movie and the screen play had some excellent moments, but it sometimes was just \"too much\". \n\nIts a hard thing to say such brilliant film makers who, again, made a good film simply tried too hard, but I think that is the core issue holding this film back.  I sort of liken this movie to an overly complicated fancy dinner. Even if it was delicious and expertly crafted, at some point the gimmicks and mastery go too far and I just want a cheeseburger. I think Miller's Crossing engaging in that overindulgence, on occasion. Still, an excellent film overall.",

Nothing much really happens where we as audience members care much about the storyline. A handful of characters are instantly, slowly or barely introduced throughout the movie, at least a dozen that have some role, but not a single one you care about nor do you understand completely what they are doing and why they are there. (With an exception to Bernie beautifully portrayed by John Turturro)\n\nAll in all Miller's Crossing is a well-made film, but the narrative is far from compelling to pull is through this movie experience and it never fully convinces in terms of either period or plot, but it sure has its moments, and when they land, they flourish",

            "content": "Our Daily Free Stream: Coen Brothers - Miller's Crossing. Hail, Caesar! heisst der neueste Film der Coen Brothers und er wird die Berlinale 2016 eröffnen. Neben Scarlett Johansson spielen Coen Stammgäste wie George Clooney, aber auch Überraschungen wie Dolph Lundgren mit. Um die Zeit zu überbrücken, zeigen wir heut einen älteren Coen Film, das Mafia Epos Miller's Crossing: Leo (Albert Finney) in seinem Büro voller dunkler Schatten, ein bleibendes Bild aus Miller's Crossing. Leo, Herr der Unterwelt, kann sich seiner Geliebten Verna nicht sicher sein. Sie ist seine einzige schwache Stelle und in dem Moment, da er weiss, dass Vernas Bruder Bernie beseitigt werden soll, zögert er. Dieses Zögern wird die gesamte Unterwelt in einen Strudel der Gewalt reissen. Leos Büro, mit geschmackvollen britischen Polstermöbeln und dunklen warmen Farben, passt aber irgendwie nicht zu einem amerikanischen Gangsterboss der späten 20er. Genauso wirken die übrigen Gangster-Figuren zu stylish, zu gewollt. Dasselbe gilt für die Inszenierung sowie die Dialoge. Alles scheint etwas zu überambitioniert. Gut gemacht, aber eben nur gemacht. Miller's Crossing leiht sich einfach die Charaktere aus den amerikanischen Gangster-Klassikern der 30er, seinen visuellen Stil aber aus dem Film Noir der 40er. Der Plot entspricht einem einfachen Gangsterfilm, nur finden wir das in den ersten 30 Minuten kaum heraus. Das liegt daran, dass die einzelnen Figuren so kompliziert eingeführt werden mit viel zu langen Dialogen über abwesende Figuren (ich habe nie verstanden, wer nun wer ist, obwohl das kaum eine Rolle spielt). Der Einstieg wird uns so unnötig schwer gemacht. Um Missverständnissen vorzubeugen, vieles ist auch gelungen an Miller's Crossing. Alber Finney als Leo spielt wie immer konzentriert, Jon Polito ist ein ebenbürtiger Rivale. Am interessantesten wirkt Bernie Bernbaum (John Turturro), der Buchmacher, dessen Auftritte in langen Monologen gipfeln. Am schönsten sind die Resonanzen aus alten Filmen, phasenweise hilft uns das auch über die grösste Schwäche von Miller's Crossing hinweg: Die fehlende Story, die uns wirklich zu fesseln vermag. So wirkt alles zwar elegant, aber auch mechanisch. Der einzige wirklich menschliche Moment besteht im Grunde in der Szene, da Leo herausfindet, dass er Verna tatsächlich nicht trauen kann. Miller's Crossing war der dritte Film der Coen Brüder und es scheint so, als ob sie damals - 1990 - noch ein bisschen geübt hatten. mehr auf cinegeek.de http://cinegeek.de/millers-crossing-rating-78-dvd93588568",

            "content": "\"You ain't got a license to kill bookies and today I ain't sellin' any. So take your flunky and dangle\".\n\nIt was in 1984 that we were introduced to (what would become) two of cinema's finest writer/director's in Joel & Ethan Coen. Their darkly cynical debut Blood Simple grabbed audiences by the crotch yet their wacky follow up, Raising Arizona, managed to tickle said area. By their third film, Miller's Crossing, there was no denying that this was truly a creative partnership that knew how to construct and deliver films of great substance and enjoyment.\n\nIn an unnamed town during prohibition times, Tom (Gabriel Byrne) is the right-hand man to crime boss Leo (Albert Finney). Leo is heavily involved with Verna (Marcia Gay Harden) and losing his judgement as a result. When rival boss Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito) comes to Leo for permission to kill Verna's brother Bernie (John Turturro) for double-crossing him, he's refused. What follows, is a war between gangs and Tom finds himself shifting allegiances while playing one side against the other.\n\nWhen it was released in 1990, Miller's Crossing was a box-office failure. It took about half of it's reportedly $10 million budget and I often wonder if this could have been influenced by Martin Scorsese's more realistic gangster film, Goodfellas, being released in the same year. In hindsight, though, it has achieved somewhat of a cult status and celebrated for depicting it's criminals and their unlawful activity in a very different fashion. \n\nThe Coen's have been known to reference a few hard-boiled crime writers throughout their films: James M. Cain had a heavy presence in The Man Who Wasn't There and Blood Simple while Raymond Chandler coursed through The Big Lebowski. In this case, it's Dashiell Hammett and, most notably, his novels The Glass Key and Red Harvest that Miller's Crossing references and intertwines.\n\nSet in 1929, Barry Sonnenfeld's rich cinematography is a thing of sumptuous beauty. He captures the time and feel of the 20's to absolute perfection by utilising a very particular gradation of colour in deep red, green and brown hues. This is arguably the Coen's most visually stunning film to date and that's saying something considering the meticulous attention to detail throughout most of their work.\n\nThe characters are just as rich. I'm not normally a fan of Gabriel Byrne but at the centre of the  labyrinthine plot he delivers a solidly reserved performance as consigliere Tom Reagan, while those around about him have the more colourful, offbeat roles - the kind of which we have now become accustomed to with the Coen's. From Albert Finney's hopelessly romantic kingpin, Leo O'Bannion to (Coen regulars) Jon Polito as his hotheaded nemesis Johnny Caspar, John Turturro's shady bookie, Bernie Bernbaum and his cohort Mink, a small but important Steve Buscemi. All of them deliver memorable work and play like caricatures from the gangster sub-genre. Their dialogue is just as colourful as their characters and the Coen's ability to write snappy, witty lines has never been more present than it is here. \n\nFrom some corners, the film received criticism for being too self-conscious in its approach. There are metaphoric images of Fedora's tumbling through autumnal forests and hilarious discussions on the \"ethics\" of corrupt business but these moments only add to the film's originality and it's ability to carve it's own niche. Admittedly, there isn't the sense of realism that you'd expect from a gangster film but when the characterisation and pallet are as striking as they are, then it's an approach that's very welcome indeed.\n\nThose who have a particular appreciation for the film-noir's of yesteryear will, no doubt, be the kind of audience that Miller's Crossing will appeal to most. However, those that appreciate smart storytelling while basking in gloriously visual filmmaking will be in safe company too. Miller's Crossing was one of the Coen brothers' earlier works and, to this day, remains one of their best.\n\nMark Walker",

And they do come through with good performances.  Turturro in particular was his usual great self.\n\nAlso some nice plot twists, and kept you guessing as to the outcome. \n\nHowever, it suffers from a fatal flaw.  It is inconsistent tonally.\n\nAt times the film dips into their trademark, quirky, darkly comic style.  (Cases in point: the sounds of explosions and gunshots in the background of one scene, the almost comical number of cops outside of a building, the way that the cops raid some establishments, all done in that exaggeratingly comic style characteristic of the Coens).  However, most of the time, it moves along as was is by far the most dramatic of the Coen's films, perhaps, and much more straightforwardly so, taking itself very seriously.  This contrasting combination makes it difficult then to take the proceedings -- which are rather overly melodramatic at times as well, and not in that Coen style -- very seriously.  It makes for an odd mix.\n\nPerhaps it is also due to casting actors that don't quite fit that Coen style.  While talented, the Irishman Bryne and the Brit Finney are playing it straight, and aren't capturing that uniquely American Coen style.  But is that what they were going for here?  That's the problem: it's unclear.\n\nMy response may also reflect my mixed feelings about the gangster genre generally.\n\nI finished it because I was curious as to the fate of the characters.  But not because I felt very invested in them, really compelled by it, or was really \nentertained by it.\n\nIn any case, I was underwhelmed.",

            "content": "Review In A Nutshell:\n\nI did not start on the Coen brother's filmography on the best of terms, seeing their so-called magnum opus \"No Country For Old Men\", which frankly left me underwhelmed and utterly disappointed; but I still had hope for them and was still willing to branch out through the rest of their films, hoping I would find that specific film that would make me believer of their genius. Afterwards, I turned to films like True Grit and The Big Lebowski but sadly no dice; though True Grit did come close. Nevertheless, I was still moving forward and now I have seen a much earlier film from the directors, Miller's Crossing. The film is by no means perfect but it didn't seem to underwhelm me as much as the rest, as I did not see this film with a high pedestal, hoping to see a masterpiece.\n\nMiller's Crossing brings back the gangster genre through influences from the films that ruled Hollywood during the 70s and pre-60s. The film is all about style, found through its detailed costumes, abundantly hard-boiled dialogue, and clever usage of locations, allowed the atmosphere of the genre to flourish with every frame. Though the film is drenched in this style, I cannot also state that it does not carry the substance to match it, but it never reached me to a peak interest that other films within the genre have successfully achieved; The Godfather being a notable one. Miller's Crossing possess the same problem that I had with The Godfather films during the first time I watched them, it features an abundance of characters that are set up through words, not seeing them until much later on the film, leaving me confused and disorientated with the film's story. I even watched the film with subtitles on, just so I do not miss out on anything substantial behind its gritty dialogue, and even then I still had to take a minute to figure out who was who. It also took me a bit of time to find interest in the film's protagonist, Tom Reagan, and it was not until the latter half of the film where the character starts to push the plot forward, did I start finding myself engaged.\n\nMiller's Crossing's story speaks about the importance of loyalty within the gangster business, and how one could also use loyalty as a weapon to defeat their enemies; I truly thought that was quite clever as most films would have trouble in drawing the character's lines in regards to their loyalty, as in films like these they are normally black and white. Though I did have trouble getting through the film's pushy dialogue, as it constantly reminded me of the values and drives of its characters, when it was long ago established in the earlier portions of the film. By now, I have understood the Coen brothers' use of comedy within their films, as even their most serious films has a hint of dark comedy scattered in there; Miller's Crossing is no exception, with multiple moments showing the directors have fun with the explored genre or create particular moments that pushes a certain element, whether it would be the acting or the execution, and all of this keeps the film from being completely self-serious; demonstrating respect while also a sense of fun.\n\nIf there was something that left a strong imprint on my mind after seeing Miller's Crossing, it would be its musical score, which was composed by Carter Burwell. The theme music of the film is so light and graceful, which makes a lot of sense because though the film is considered a gangster flick, there is not of elements in there that is excessively violent or thematically dark. Though the track is not as powerful as say Thomas Newman's score for Road to Perdition, but Miller's Crossing is a much less sentimental of a film. Burwell's score does a wonderful job in shaping the world that the film is trying to convey and the lightness in its tone never at all hurts the way we see its characters.\n\nThe acting performances in this film is no doubt strong but there are a couple instances in there where I felt they push the personalities of their characters way too much, and by too much I mean going past beyond the area where it feels funny and instead comes off as cartoonish or artificial. Gabriel Byrne and John Turturro was both great in this, committed to making their characters feel distinct and identifiable. Jon Polito also does a wonderful job in the film, by constantly making his presence known when within the frame, managing to make his character to come off as both slightly funny but also menacing. Albert Finney as Leo, was the weakest link in the film's casting; showing very little of what makes his character special, standing stale and generic when placed side by side with the other actors that I have just mentioned.\n\nMiller's Crossing does have a number of positive things that runs it, but it is not without its narrative flaws. I feel that this would be a film that may potentially grow on me through multiple viewings, as its complicated storyline requires patience and effort from its viewers in order to comprehensively understand the layers that shape it.",

            "content": "I'm trying to wrap my head around this movie...wait I've almost got it...no, not yet. I love a good mind-bender, and Miller's Crossing certainly ends up being one of those. Trying to keep track of the characters and who's doing what, and why Tom is doing the things he is doing, it's downright exhausting. By the end I felt like the story really wasn't all that complex but the way the dialogue is thrown at you rapid-fire, and so many characters are talked about when they're not on the screen it all becomes a bit harder to track. I could see myself watching this movie again a couple of times now that I have nailed down which nicknames belong to which guys, and I've become accustomed to the lingo they use. Sadly, despite that desire to watch Miller's Crossing again to suss out all the details, there was just something about the movie that didn't click with me. It's hard to put my finger on what fell short. Perhaps it's just the genre, since I'm not particularly fond of gangster movies. Maybe it is the way the movie walks the line between drama and comedy, and I'm always struggling to see which side they are intending to fall on.\n\nThe acting is all great. John Turturro, and Jon Polito are particularly brilliant and I wish I could have seen even one scene with the 2 of them together. Gabriel Byrne gives a very measured performance as Tom, and I like how he speaks so little but is clearly thinking so much. My favorite aspect of the movie actually came as the end credits rolled and I was left to wonder how much of this was planned out by Tom, and how much was simply him rolling with the punches (literally.) As you can see, if nothing else, Miller's Crossing made me think and that's something that a lot of films just don't accomplish. I can definitely see why people love it, but I also can see why it wasn't so successful at the box office. This movie is an acquired taste, and might take more than one viewing to fully appreciate.",

I was inspired to see this film at the recommendation of Matt Sloan of Welcome to the Basement.\n\nThis movie feels like it was pulled straight out of the thirties and transferred to a 90's production- that is to say, it feels incredibly authentic. The dialogue feels almost foreign because of the time removed between the then and the now. There's jargon and lingo that leave you pondering the meaning of phrases, much like in A Clockwork Orange (but not quite as opaque.) \n\nIt's a slower churn of a film- the movement doesn't really pick up until the third act- and all of the nicknames and turns of phrase can leave you scrambling to keep the plot together- but in the end you're left with a very genuine feeling gangster picture from the masters of dialogue. So many great one-liners. (\"What's the rumpus?\")\n\nBy today's standards, it's one of their lesser known works, but if you're interested in exploring some of their films that came before Fargo, this is worth the two hour time investment.",

I remember really enjoying the movie the first time around but this time I enjoyed it much more. I could better appreciate Tommy's intricate plan and his relation to the entire movie. Tommy is a smart character that is so cool and together he's almost passive (except for fleeting moments of desperation) we don't know much about him other than what we see him do. Tommy is defined strictly by his actions. As is everyone in the film, considering it's totally character driven. And what a colorful cast of characters it is! A character can only be as smart as his writers (that's why the new Sherlock Holmes films are short on detective work and big on action), and the Coen's are always incredibly clever. The movie looks absolutely beautiful as well, the 1920's iconography, photographed by Barry Sonnenfeld is exemplified perfectly in a scene where Tommy squeezes a soaked towel into a bowl near a bottle of liquor. That shot almost sums up the entire film. It's static, beautiful, incredibly well composed and has a lot of character to it.\nWhile it's more of an actor's picture, there are a few great set pieces in the film. The repeated speak easy busts by the police, bursts of graphic violence, and the wonderful suspenseful scene of Albert Finney's character Leo's attempted assassination. The movie is just wonderful, clever dialogue. ('He's got a heart and he's kind\". \"So it's true that opposites attract\") All the scheming and double crossing is brilliant as the movie unfolds. This movie is incredibly watchable and subject to many repeat viewings. I'd have to say the key to its success is atmosphere, which is something I really identify with in a film. I identified this trait after having watched Fincher's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo later in the day. The movie creates a great world for the characters to occupy (we are never told what city we are in).\nBy the end of the film, Tommy has wrapped up all his woes using his cleverness and ability to \"play an angle\". But I'm not entirely sure he has changed as a character. His one emotional connection in the film, Verna, has left him and he quits working for Leo. I'm not entirely sure why. What has he learned? How has he changed? It's not a fault of the movie, because I leave completely satisfied by the end. I'm sure it's a question that has an answer and I'll have to watch it again!",

            "content": "Miller's Crossing is, as of now, my least favorite Coen brothers film, yet that's not saying much because they're among my favorite filmmakers of all time. There's definitely a lot to admire here, and I could easily tell as to why someone would adore this film. It has all the typical elements of a classic Coen brothers film, including the unpredictable twists, the sheer style, the quirky characters and dialogue, and the absurd morbid, dark humor. Yet for some odd reason that I can't quite exactly pin down, Miller's Crossing failed to resonate me, and although it certainly had its moments of amazement, it was thematically weak. You would think that if the gangster genre, which is one of those ultra-cool, stylish, and complex genres, and a Coen brothers film, which are all different but are all so unique in the best way possible, combined, the results would be groundbreaking. Evidently, many other people that have watched this film love it, many even claiming it's one of their best, and as I said, I could definitely see why. However, I'm in the clear minority here, and I wanted to love this movie considering how refreshing it often is to see a Coen brothers film, but it didn't quite work for me. This is one of those films that I'll have to re-watch at one point in order to fully enjoy the experience.\n\nMiller's Crossing has a plot similar to Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo, where the protagonist, in this case Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne) is conflicted between two rival gangs, and he must play off of both sides. Miller's Crossing takes place during the 1930s, and tells the tale about a conflict between Irish boss Leo (Albert Finney) and Italian boss Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito). Leo's right-hand man, Tom Reagan, has the same love interest as Leo, Verna Bernbaum (Marcia Harden). However, things get worse when Tom refuses to get rid of Bernie, who's a bookie (and Verna's brother) that Johnny has intentions to kill, and instead attempts to protect him. It's hard to explain the plot from there, because there are tons of unpredictable twists and double-crossings due to the fact that Tom is stuck between these two rival gangs. It's very ponderous and convoluted for such a simple story, and the plot was used far more effectively in Leone's A Fistful of Dollars and Kurosawa's Yojimbo. I must admit that from the very opening of the movie, I knew that this wouldn't quite be up to par with other Coen brothers classics, mainly due to the fact that everything felt and looked so drab and bland. I don't mean that by the style, because I've heard lots of people saying the style was used to great effect, even many saying that this is a style over substance film. It's certainly not the stylish production's fault, it's the characters' fault.\n\nSome of the characters here were unfortunately less than compelling here, especially the protagonist. I felt like the protagonist was very boring and monotone, and it felt like he wasn't attached to anything- whether it was the love interest, the mob bosses, the money, or anything in general. He felt like an emotionless robot, and I honestly can't tell if he was acted well or not for that reason. In other adaptations of Yojimbo (and Yojimbo itself), the protagonist was compelling and exciting, such as the Man With No Name. He has a stoic personality, and he's mostly a man of few words, but whenever he talks, it's easy to tell that something amazing's about to happen. For Tom Reagan, however, I could barely hear (or care) about what he was saying. I wasn't too big of a fan about Tom's love interest, Verna, either. The two practically felt emotionless and drab, and that was a big shame (especially for Tom) because these are the people that you're supposed to be rooting for. A few of the other characters, including Johnny, Eddie Dane (J.E. Freeman; Johnny's assistant), and Bernie were just as quirky and exciting as you'd expect from a Coen brothers film. There's plenty of dark humor, but I felt like this film didn't know if it wanted to be a riveting drama about the gangster era and morals, or if it wanted to be a darkly humorous gangster drama. The ending was apparently supposed to be really meaningful, supposedly symbolizing the change of moods and lifestyle of characters, but honestly, I felt no attachment to these characters to begin with, so in the end, I really didn't care about what was going to happen to them.\n\nDon't get me wrong, however, because like all Coen brothers films, Miller's Crossing has moments of brilliance. There are darkly hilarious moments that were seriously hilarious, and I couldn't stop laughing watching them, or even thinking about them. There's one moment in particular involving Leo, a few hitmen, a mansion, and tommy guns, and I'd rather not spoil it, but it was brilliantly, morbidly hilarious. There's also another scene later in the movie involving Eddie Dane and Johnny Caspar, and that was macabre but hilarious (although I'm not sure if I was supposed to be laughing at that scene). The stylish production is great to look at and feel here, whether it's the cinematography, the brilliant soundtrack by the Coen brothers' frequent collaborator in music, Carter Burwell, or if its the portrayal of the gangster era. There's one location with a forest that looks breathtaking (and the scenes used along with the location are great as well), the music is beautiful, and the whole film is incredibly stylish. There are shots where a fedora is floating and sailing through the forest, and the suits, the guns, the set designs, and everything when it comes to the overall look of the film are very well-made. There are even cameos by Steve Buscemi, Sam Raimi, and Frances McDormand in very minor roles, and the signature style of the Coen brothers is obviously here, with cleverly written dialogue and great performances (when they needed to be, anyways), but I honestly couldn't get invested in the conflicts of the characters.\n\nThis is one of those films that I'll definitely have to re-watch at one point or another if I really want to get the full experience offered by this film. However, it honestly just felt overly-convoluted and drab for a plot like this, and I'm not going to call it overrated by any means, and I still admire this movie purely because effort was obviously put into getting down the feeling of the era. I honestly wish I liked this movie, because as I said, it has all the elements to be a groundbreaking Coen brothers film, but it didn't quite click for me. This is a hard film to review because I'm clearly in the minority here and it's quite hard to really pin down as to what I didn't love about this film, yet despite all the flaws I'm listing here, I can't rate this film as a bad or even mediocre movie. It's certainly a film that should be seen whether you're a fan of the gangster genre or the Coen brothers, because many will probably (and evidently, they have) adore this one more than me. It's most likely my least favorite Coen brothers film to date, but don't get me wrong, it certainly had its moments of brilliance and it had the style down, but I couldn't get myself invested into the characters nor the plot. Miller's Crossing is definitely an admirable effort that I can't hate, although I'm going to have to re-watch it if I really want to get hooked into the plot.",

I watch every frame and just know the devotion that went into filming this movie, every new filmmaker should marvel at what is one of the greatest films ever made. There isn't a character a like and each actor brings quality to the role they inhabit, this is one of the key components to the Brothers films, the strong characters.

I've never seen anything that they've produced that I haven't loved or at least not really liked. Everything is so well done. Gabiel Byrne, Albert Finney and John Turturro are all so good. The dialogue is spot-on and the cinematography is beautiful. Watching this reminded me of the old gangster movies of the past, which I'm sure was part of the Coen's point. There was so much double-crossing, so many mob hits, and pointless gangster violence...it was great.\n\nThe only shortcoming I had with the film is the ending which was a little too open-ended.

May be hard for viewers not interested in crime films to follow the back and fourth scenes of mob and bookie talks. Gabriel Byrne is just short of evil but still charming. Lots of walk away one liners that Joel and Ethan Cohen expert in. Turturro might be the most compelling of all the actors with his slick talk bravado and sick attitude. The cast ensemble in general interacts together maliciously. The film lacks the deepest of meanings but is always entertaining, well written and cleverly comical. Reagan proves to be powerful but still a drunk who's soft around the edges for co actress Marcia Gay Harden's character Verna. The swift but bloody shoot out between Leo and the Tommy Gun yielding mobsters is one of my personal film favorites. He is unaffected by wizzing bullets with a poetic feel accompanied by the Italian vocal song playing. Reagan's hat symbolizes his constant loss of control over the things around him, including keeping his cap on his head. Turturro could have received nominations just based on his 'beg for life' scene. The concept of three of the mobsters being gay is almost refreshing and completely different. The end of the film is fast paced and exhilarating in a gloomy manner.",

The Coens have always found a way to take what influenced them and manage to add a new little twist or nook to it that gives it that flavor that the Coens are known for.  Whether it is the idiosyncratic characters, their darkly comic dialogue, or their stylish cinematography.  This film is obviously, in part as noir films also had a great influence on this film, influenced by Yojimbo at least as far as the story goes.  You have Tom Reagan playing the Irish mob and the Italian mob against each other like Toshiro Mifune does in that film.  But, again, the noir genre also had a big part to play in how the film was written.  Unlike their next film, Barton Fink, which was covered in so much subtext that multiple viewings of that film are a must if you want to catch all the little details, this one is much more straightforward, though that's not to say the film won't reveal more information in multiple viewings.  It still has that trademark Coen brothers humor as well as some topnotch writing, simply topnotch dialogue here.  The story, on the other hand, while solid and having some interesting twists and turns, simply isn't wonderful.  It's great seeing Tom manipulate both sides against each other, I just think they tried too hard to incorporate many different characters into the 'main story' so to speak.  This is something they improved GREATLY upon in Barton Fink.  That film had fewer characters and it was still a very complex story with a lot information to digest.  I just think they spend too much time trying to get some many characters in the film that Tom's character, other than playing both sides against each other, isn't really that memorable.  Especially compared to Barton Fink.  I realize it's unfair to compare the two films as they're clearly very different, but the story can be a bit of a mess sometimes.  That's not to say the film isn't great because I still really liked the film and I would definitely recommend it.  It's just that in the Coens' filmography, this isn't close to one of their best.  Still an excellent film though.  Funny, clever, stylish...everything you can expect from the Coens.",

Leo's right hand man, Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne), is with the same woman as Leo, and keeps tabs on everybody before he seemingly changes allegiances. The plot is a dense one, and the key to understanding it lies in the expertly and cleverly written dialogue delivered by the ensemble of talented actors. The film bears the marks of the Coen Brothers' signature style with moments of dark humor sprinkled on its otherwise serious and brooding overtone. There is also a focus on morals within the gangster world as well as the use of hats to symbolize both clarity and status. What sets Miller's Crossing apart from other films of this genre is its ability to show and reflect on what drives these characters and its subtlety in doing so is what makes the movie so enthralling.",

            "content": "Riding the resurgence of the gangster genre from the 1990's at a similar time to Goodfellas but before Bugsy, Miller's Crossing is amongst them as a lesser known effort.\nThis is unfortunate, as Miller's Crossing is an impeccably stylish and involving gangster film with a gripping story and involving characters.\n\nThe effort of The Coen Brothers is maximised in Miller's Crossing, as the applied style boasts the benefit of astounding visual quality combined with Academy Award worthy cinematography from Barry Sonnenfield which establishes the combined atmospheres of noir and gangster films, a crossover iconic of The Coen Brothers' efforts. The cinematography and visual style are impeccable, and the production design and costumes render Miller's Crossing impeccably set up for critical success. \nSo with the atmosphere already established by the excellent visual qualities of Miller's Crossing, next in line comes the story. Although the story is a small scale one with a complex amount of inner character dynamics serving as the front to establish importance, it works. Certain viewers may be thrown off by the slow pacing of Miller's Crossing and the allegorical dialogue may confuse them at times, but frankly Miller's Crossing tells its story impeccably well, combined with various themes and a strong level of violence to capture the brutality of the gangster world. The violence is never used to excess, but deals wonders to the drama of the story and actually is some of the finest violence I've ever seen in a film in my life, because its built on the foundation of great action scenes, spectacular sound effects and immaculate editing. Miller's Crossing constructs it weaponry brutally excellently and keeps it at a sophisticated level to enhance the atmosphere and keep the film alive. The sleight of hand that directors Joel Coen and Ethan Coen had with handling Miller's Crossing is impeccable, and I am stunned it was ignored by the Academy Awards because a film written so skilfully, directed so effortfully and designed with such absolute tenacity is worthy of a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Picture, among others.\nThe acting too was ignored, and that is despicable considering the acting in Miller's Crossing is some of the most intense and engaging acting I've seen in a film in a long time. To be frank, Miller's Crossing deserves two Academy Award nominations for Best Supporting Actor.\nThe first nomination goes to John Tuturro. His performance is a strongly emotional one where he grips absolute fear and injects empathy straight into the heart of the viewers, only to turn it around instantly with a sleight of hand and emotional manipulation. He only has a brief time on screen, but his scenes are amongst the finest of the film due to his acting and ability to play such a strongly manipulative character who can fearlessly trip and kick a man in the face without giving it a second thought and then suddenly be on his knees with crocodile tears. John Tuturro is unforgettable in Miller's Crossing, and its his single finest performance throughout his career.\nThe second Oscar nomination goes to Joe Polito, because his physicality makes him an intimidating figure, but he articulates his words with an iconic voice and grip on his characters' emotions so that his success is double in effectiveness. Truly, Miller's Crossing is Joe Polito's finest performance to date and establishes the fact that he is a master with the sleight of hand for the gangster genre. No matter how many times he shouts \"Son of a Bitch!\" it never gets old and becomes more-or-less better every time without a sense of excessive repetition. His performance in Miller's Crossing is an unforgettable one and he is the centre of attentive focus the whole film because he takes the show and runs with it. \nBoth John Tuturro and Joe Polito go to show that The Coen Brothers have the ability to bring out the best in actors.\nAlso, in one of his finest efforts up next to another gangster-ish crime film The Usual Suspects, Gabriel Byrne takes the lead in Miller's Crossing with sophistication and skill without ever slipping up, conveying the strong stoicism required by his character and playing a role that embodies a mix of gangster and noir, as if to play a mix of Jack Nicholson in Chinatown and Robert De Niro in Goodfellas. Gabriel Byrne makes a terrific effort in Miller's Crossing, and he symbolises just what styles the film embody.\n\nFrankly, the first time you watch Miller's Crossing it may come of as slow, but its an impeccable gangster masterpiece and is truly one of The Coen Brothers' finest efforts.",

The first time I saw it, I didn't like it hugely when compared to their other work. Now, it just may be my all time favourite Coen Brothers film. It is 1929. Leo (Albert Finney) and Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito) are rival gang leaders. Caspar wants to kill Bernie (John Torturro) for ruining his bets, and Leo won't allow it because he is in love with Bernie's sister, Verna (Marcia Gay Harden). Little does he know that his right hand man, Tom (Gabriel Byrne) is having an affair with Verna behind Leo's back. When war is waged between Leo and Caspar, Tom is forced to pick sides and construct an intricate plan apparently to save his own skin. Caspar's right hand man, the Dane (J.E. Freeman) is beginning to become wise to Tom's plan and gets even more agressive when Tom questions the loyalty of his lover, Mink (Steve Buscemi). I am sure anyone who hasn't seen the film will have passed out by now, but trust me, it's not as complex as it sounds. It's shot beautifully and the acting is some of the best I've seen. The writing is a fantastic echoe of the Film Noirs and gangster pictures from years gone by. It's thrilling but not at all melodramatic or overdone. Carter Burwell's score is flawless, and the mix of drama, action, humour and romance makes for an amazing filmic experience. Just great.",

            "content": "With \"Miller's Crossing\" Joel Coen and Ethan Coen made a gangster film masterpiece and arguably one of the best films of the 1990s. Gabriel Byrne plays Tom Reagan, the right hand man of prohibition era crime boss Leo O'Bannon, Albert Finney in a lion of a performance. The plot is far too complicated and serpentine to summarize in a few sentences, but essentially Tom finds himself between to rival gangs, ALA Akira Kurosawa's \"Yojimbo\" or James M. Cain's \"Love's Lovely Counterfeit.\" \"Miller's Crossing\" is a beautiful homage to so many films, but manages to also become something wholly original. The Coen Brothers have taken genre archetypes and touchstones and make them completely their own. Handsomely shot by by ace cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld (\"Raising Arizona,\" \"Big,\" \"Misery\") and bolstered by a lush Irish tinged score by composer Carter Burwell, the film would be worth watching simply for its rich production values, but it offers so much more. The film bristle with cracking dialogue that can be classic tough guy noir:\n\nEddie Dane: You understand that if we don't find a stiff out here, we leave a fresh one.\n\nOr funny:\n\nTom Reagan: I am awake.\nTad: Your eyes are shut.\nTom Reagan: Who you gonna believe?\n\nOr deep:\n\nTom Reagan: Nobody knows anybody. Not that well.\n\nTo even heartbreaking:\n\nVerna: I thought you said you didn't care about Leo no more. \nTom Reagan: I said we're through. That's not the same thing.\n\nThe story is as cleverly serpentine as the best Dashille Hammett or Raymond Chandler novel, but unlike many throwback gangster or noir films, this film tells it story with a heavy reliance on visuals, where the audience shown things, whether it's a look or a slow pan across an object, rather than an over reliance on telling the audience everything, which makes this film an experience of pure cinema. The film also excels in characterization. There's not a single character in the film who does not see themselves as a the hero of their own story. It didn't strike me until repeated viewing that the seemingly villainous Johnny Casper is really a hapless victim. From the opening scene he is completely honest and open about his intentions and consistently sticks to his word. Ethics! The one character with zero ethics, John Turturro's Bernie Bernbaum. He's true to himself, which is being unashamedly out for himself. Or take the menacing Eddie Dane, who is nearly right almost all along and reads the situation just about perfectly. I've always felt the best films don't have black hat villains and have characters who are all the heroes of their own story, and \"Miller's Crossing\" is a great example of this.  Overall, I will make the bold pronouncement that this film is one of the best film of the 1990s and is the best gangster films of all-time, standing alongside Brian De Palma's \"The Untouchables,\" John Milius' \"Dillinger,\" and Arthur Penn's \"Bonnie & Clyde\" as the best modern incarnation since the Golden Age of Hollywood.

It is a movie that is overshadowed by other mobster movies like Goodfellas and is also under appreciated, not only as a mobster film, but as a Coen film. Miller's Crossing isn't given the credit it deserves. This gave audiences a sneak peek at what they would soon see in Fargo. The plot twists and turns and at times you don't know what the characters angles are or who they are really being loyal to. \n\nA crime boss(Leo) and his right hand man(Tommy) split. Tommy turns his back on Leo and goes and joins up with Leo's enemy(Casper). There's so much going on, that the plot is kind of hard to describe from here. Casper wants a bookie dead and Leo doesn't. Leo and Tommy have the same love interest and that love interest's brother is the bookie. Casper's right hand man(the Dane) hates Tommy and likewise with Tommy. It isn't as hard to follow while watching the film, but there is a lot of double crossings and at times you really don't know what is going to happen.\n\nMiller's Crossing doesn't have the huge following of other Coen films like The Big Lebowski or Fargo. But big Coen brother fans know and love this movie because it is such a brilliant piece of filmmaking. You can put the dialogue up there with the best of the Coen's work. The films graphic violence scenes are masterfully well done, and although Roger Deakins didn't do the cinematography on Miller's Crossing, Barry Sonnenfeld does a great job making the movie look good.\n\nAs good as Miller's Crossing is, Joel and Ethan would still improve from here and go on to make even better movies. This deserves consideration when talking about the best of the best when it comes to the mobster genre. It might not be Goodfellas, but it isn't too far from it.\n\nVerna: Maybe that's why I like you, Tom. I've never met anyone who made being a son of a bitch such a point of pride. ",

That 3 hour experience is an hour-and-a-half you'll never get back, but that doesn't quite mean that their movies are bad. It's just that these guys are why they have the concept of \"The Emperor Has No Clothes\". Well, sure enough, this film is not what people are cracing it up to be. However, when the critics said that it boasts sharp dialogue, fine cinematography and solid performances, they hit the nail right on. Of course, they also had it right when they called the story a bit loose and when you mix that with the slowness, if you notice it, it's easy to lose interest from time to time. Other flaws include a lack of development, a somewhat unfitting score, some disturbances, some forced comic relief,\r\n\r\nStill, although it is no duller than any other Coen Classic, this film marks a turning point in some of the Coens' filmmaking, as they incorporate much of what's great about them. Sure, these traits are in the early stages, so their not as effective as they are now, but they remain present nonetheless. The Coens are some very funny writers, but when they're subtle, they're too subtle. Here, although their more blatant sense of humor here is a bit forced from time to time, as well as bit unoriginal, it's still quite effective. They have also upped the snap in their dialogue, with each line being consistently razor sharp. Although it can't fully do away with the slowness, this dialogue does add some kick to the storytelling, but couldn't have done so without the just-as-snappy delivery of the performers. Of course, the dialogue ins't the only thing solid about the performers, nor is it the only thing solid about the Coens.\r\n\r\nThere's plenty of praise for the Coens that I don't agree with, but when I hear someone praise their acting direction, taste in style, snappy dialogue and less subtle sense of humor, I just have to say \"I hate to admit it, but you're right.\" Coen actors are distinctive, though not particularly monotonous. Each character has its own sublte, but still effective level of uniquness, but you can expect almost all of them to be quirky, memorable and overall well-performed. You can expect that trademark here, as well as the Coens' taste in visual style. Like many other fellow Coen films, this film features very impressive cinematography, with subtle, yet effectivley smooth quality and a fairly wide scope to put you in the environment. As for their storytelling here, it is rather uneven, but they do set a steady rise in compellingness as the film progresses, until it finally comes down to a pretty good ending. I'm not particularly a Coens fan, because there's so much of their work that falls flat to me, but on the whole, I have much respect for the them for their snappy style that keep their slow films going, even in here, where their style began making some turning points.\r\n\r\nOverall, although it is yet another slow entry in the Coen Catalogue, (man, they really should get into product branding) only with a little more uneveness, \"Miller's Crossing\" is kept going by solid performances, a smooth style, as well as sharp writing and directing by the Coens, leaving it to be a worthy turning point in the Coens' snappy filmmaking style.",

(It's in theory an adaptation of [i]Glass Key[/i], apparently, but it draws influence from [i]Yojimbo[/i] and therefore [i]Red Harvest[/i].)  However, I think it's interesting that that most literary of pulp writers has influenced some of the most cinematic of filmmakers.  I'm not sure if Joel and Ethan Coen would thank me for calling them such, and I strongly suspect Kurosawa would have asked me to define my terms.  However, all three have made movies which explore the very capability of film as a medium and as an artform, and Dashiell Hammett stretched what pulp detective novels could do.  I think artists are drawn to art, though I don't think that's a revolutionary thought, and I think you'll find the art to draw on even if it isn't in the medium you yourself use.  It's also unsurprising that you will seek out the influences of your own influences.\r\n\r\nTom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne) makes things happen for Leo (Albert Finney), who runs an unnamed town which might be in New Jersey.  (\"The Palisades\" gets a mention.)  Leo has a rivalry with Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito), who thinks he should be running the town instead.  He wants to get Tom to work for him, and specifically, he wants Tom to take out Bernie Bernbaum (Jon Turturro).  Unfortunately, Bernie's sister is Verna (Marcia Gay Harden), who is Leo's girlfriend.  Oh, and she's fooling around with Tom.  However, things get complicated, to the point where I'm not entirely sure what was going on half the time, and Tom ends up working for Johnny Caspar after all.  And even though it isn't Tom's usual role, he is told to kill Bernie himself.  He lets Bernie live for Verna's sake, which turns out to be a big mistake.  There are layers and layers to the action, and I'm not sure the Coens themselves know what's going on at any one time.\r\n\r\nI think many of the techniques director of photography Barry Sonnenfeld used in this film would later serve the Coens well in films such as [i]O Brother, Where Art Thou[/i].  I don't know why Sonnenfeld stopped working with the Coens, but it's worth noting that he directed [i]The Addams Family[/i] the following year.  At any rate, much of the visual aesthetic of the movie was his work.  He told the brothers that the scenes at the little clearing in the woods called Miller's Crossing needed to be filmed exclusively on cloudy days.  Where he really lucked out, because the Coens didn't let the weather alter their filming schedule, and the fact that there is but a single scene in the movie with sun filtering through the trees is merely a quirk of fate.  The clouds merely did Sonnenfeld's bidding.  His use of lenses and angles are more technical than the average person cares about, but I think even the most film-ignorant viewer can feel the difference.\r\n\r\nThe Coens have a knack for the period piece.  Whether it's the sweeping grandeur of [i]True Grit[/i] or the urban claustrophobia of [i]The Hudsucker Proxy[/i], the Golden Age Hollywood of [i]Barton Fink[/i] or the Depression-Era South of [i]O Brother[/i], I honestly think their best work is done in the past.  I like [i]Fargo[/i] a great deal, of course, but it is actually a period piece, albeit a period perhaps ten years before the film was made.  I'm a rebel in that I don't much care for [i]Raising Arizona[/i] or [i]The Big Lebowski[/i], among their films actually set in about the year they're made.  I think there's something to reproducing an era that concentrates their abilities.  I suppose I'll have to wait until [i]No Country For Old Men[/i] to get a full perspective, though on further thought, I don't know when that one's set, either.  I don't think whimsy is enough, and I think their modern pieces are heavier on the whimsy than the character development or the artistry.\r\n\r\nThere is very little whimsy here.  Oh, there's the bit about how Johnny calls Bernie \"the shmatte,\" which is Yiddish for an old bit of rag--a piece of trash.  Though how Johnny Caspar, who is played by an Italian-American actor, knows Yiddish, I don't know.  There's the bit about how Bernie just appears in Tom's apartment when Tom doesn't let him in; I'm particularly amused by his statement that he didn't answer the phone because it probably wasn't for him.  But this is neo-noir, driven by forces too dark to let a little silliness into the proceedings.  The happiest ending possible for this movie is the one with the lowest body count.  Maybe it would have been best if Tom had just walked away before all this started, but of course he couldn't.  Tom is not the kind of character who knows how.  What's more, he probably doesn't know how to live a normal life, one without corruption and gangsters and so forth.  It's certainly not as though he'd be able to make a living at gambling, after all.",

There isn't a major performance I'd say is any less than fantastic however, with my favorite being either Jon Polito or John Turturro.

There aren't enough funny moments and thematically the film is very weak. The noir elements of the film felt like they were squeezing all of the life out of the film. The femme fatale, the brooding/unpredictable protagonist, and the convoluted plot make most of the film feel uncomfortably familiar. I haven't seen enough classic film noirs to be derisive of the genre itself, but of the copycats I have seen, I am not impressed by it. The protagonist in a noir is never as complex as the film makes him out to be- he's just conflicted. And the protagonist in this film seems more flighty than he does multi-layered. He plays everyone against each other for seemingly no reason. The Man With No Name archetype, at least, has very clear motivations. Clint Eastwood's cowboy embodied the Noir protagonist, except set in a Western. The Man With No Name is self serving to the end. The Noir protagonist doesn't know what the the hell he wants, which makes him boring to watch. I am fine with conflicted protagonists but their conflict has to be interesting. As it is, the main character in this film isn't attached to anything- he doesn't want the girl, he doesn't care about his mob boss, he doesn't care about money...he's almost a slightly emotional android. Therein lies my central problem with the film (and maybe the film noir genre itself- time will tell on that one). I also don't like the convoluted mystery aspect of a noir film. I don't like mysteries at all unless the characters are elevated above the plot (like the detective serial element of the Harry Potter films).\n\nDon't get me wrong. There are some great moments. The unpredictable stand offs, the circus that is the gangsters and police, and the performances all are up to par with other Coen Brothers films. This film just doesn't have enough soul. It is caught up in its boring protagonist and mediocre plotting.",

The Coens always made solid, entertaining films aside from one film, which I won't mention. They are perfectionists of cinema. Miller's Crossing is a stunning gangster film that is set during the prohibition era. This film is a masterpiece of the crime genre, and the Coen Brothers have made a memorable film that will appeal to fans of gangster films and crime films in general for that matter. Miller's Crossing has got an incredible cast of talented actors. The film is well crafted, and the pace of this film is really what elevates this film in telling a terrific, effective and emotional story. The Coens are masters at their craft and it shows. The cast are terrific. Gabriel Byrne gives an excellent performance as Tom Reagan an Irish mob bosses' right hand man. Albert Finney plays Leo, the mob boss that Tom works for. Finney is incredible in the part he plays. The film is an epic in crime films, and fans of the genre owe themselves the chance to check this film out. Miller's Crossing has a few memorable and classic scenes. One scene that made the film truly something different was when Leo nearly gets assassinated and gets the upper hand, and arms himself with a Tommy Gun and in a very stylized and violent scene, kills his potential murderers Hey, the old man is still an artist with a Thompson. Another scene was when Tom is force to knock off Bernie Bembaum (John Torturro) that scene has so much power as we see Bernie beg for his life. Miller's Crossing is a flawless gangster film, and it definitely ranks up there as one of the best gangster films such as The Godfather, Goodfellas and Once Upon A Time in America.",

            "content": "The Coen Brothers MILLER'S CROSSING [1990]: with the second instalment into my week long Coen Bothers review series the next film I'm taking a look at is the Coen's gangster film that blends elements of Film-Noir movies and influences from THE GODFATHER and Akira Kurosawa's YOJIMBO [1961] in an original way. So without any tougher ado here is the second review instalment in my Coen Bothers Review week.\r\n\r\n\r\nDay Two: MILLER'S CROSSING [1990]: in the tradition of most gangster films Post- THE GODFATHER the majority of modern gangster films are generally set back in the 1920's, 1930's and 1940's. With The Coen's MILLER'S CROSSING is set in the days of the Prohibition era in some big U.S city as this films back drop. With the Coen's behind this film MILLER'S CROSSING is a very good film but not one of the greatest films of all time. Out of five stars this film would get a rating of three and 1/2 in my book but don't get me wrong despite this MILLER'S CROSSING is a solid piece of dramatic entertainment.\r\n\r\n \r\nTHE PLOTLINE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn some large U.S city in the days of Prohibition, the story of this film sees the top crime boss of the city an Irish crime boss called Leo starts to have trouble with the Italian Crime Boss Johnny Casper over one Bookie called Bernie.  The problem being Leo is in a relationship with Bernie's sister Verna, and despite Leo's trusted aid Tom Regan (Gabriele Byrne) suspecting that Casper wants Bernie dead, Leo ignores Casper's demands. The result is Johnny Casper who has grown in power starts to muscle out Leo from the top position as dominant crime lord of the city. When Leo needs help Tom it turns out Verna had slept with Tom, Leo oust him from his organised criminal group.\r\n\r\n  \r\nTom then approaches Johnny Casper to join his mob after this happens but with Casper's trusted henchman Eddie Dane isn't convinced of Tom's newly found loyalty so a test is then required. With Casper now the new crime overlord of the city Casper now has the power to kill of Bernie. Eddie and his associates make Tom take Bernie out to Miller's crossing to kill him. But deep within the woods Tom with possible feelings for Verna can't kill Bernie so Tom spares Bernie's life on the condition he is to leave the city, but will Eddie be convinced of Tom's newly found loyalty and will Bernie be more trouble alive rather than dead?\r\n\r\nTHE ACTING, DIRECTION, AND CINEMA-PHOTOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the performances in this film, all are generally very good from the cast but the real show stealer is Gabriele Byrne as Tom Regan. For the most part it almost seems like either Byrne or the Coen's had envisioned this character as a clone of Michael Corleone of THE GODFATHER saga. Byrne seems to copy how Michael was played by Al Pacino in the end of the First GODFATHER and throughout THE GODFATHER PART 2 as a once decent person losing all sense of normal emotion and humanity. \r\n\r\nThe direction by The Coen's is fairly decent in this film, for an early Coen Brothers film MILLER'S CROSSING sees the pair at this stage developing into fully fledge Auteur filmmakers. In the spirit of dramatic gangster films The Coen's do make this film a nail biter in parts with one or two good old fashioned killing (much expected in a Mob film), but as a whole  it's just downright average.\r\n\r\nWhat isn't average is the Cinema-Photography; this film was shot by none other than the same director of Photography of RAISING ARIZONA and unlike that film over the top style of shooting, MILLER'S CROSSING has some fantastic and static shots which just looks great in relation to this films story.\r\n\r\nOverall Thoughts: MILLER'S CROSSING is overall a very good and straight forward film. But since it blends elements form greater films, MILLER'S CROSSING does come across as being heavily influenced by THE GODFATHER [1972] and YOJIMBO [1961]. But that aside I must confess this Coen Brother film is a good one from the brotherly duo, my rating is a deserved 70%.",

Though I am not unaware of the ingenious hold he has on the all the ingredients of Cinema from Cinematography to Art Direction to Dialogues, the admiration at times is limited by the recollection of a sense of boredom I have felt while watching few films of his.\n\nIt was till I watched Miller's Crossing today which almost blasted all the skepticism I had about the duo. Miller's Crossing has all the characteristic style of Coen brothers. The cinematography is sumptuous, the dialogues crackle with the usual dash of humor he incorporates and the conflicting mixture of violence & humor or serene background score keeps the atmosphere charged all times. But above all it's the entertainment quotient the movie has, brought through by one exciting character after another where this Coen brothers film trumps all their works. And none so exciting as Tom Reagen brilliantly played by Gabriel Byrne. It's one the most mystifying leading character I have seen in Cinema. He gets beaten up by anybody & everybody,one scene in which he raises his hand on anybody in the film will have you laughing your head off, but still is a pain in the ass for everyone, a person everybody wants to be on his side due to the street smart personality & keen eye he has about people, a kind of modernized version of old Humphree Bogart, only more amoral & less apologetic. \n\nWhether Miller's Crossing is Coen brother's best is matter of incessant argument but for me it's the most endearing work by them, a film that finally turned me into a fan of Coen brothers.",

I quite like the Coens' work, but this is one that has escaped me thus far, hence the borrowing of said DVD. It's very definitely a Coen brothers script with some excellent dialogue and plenty of plot twists. I'll give you my thoughts later, but here's a brief summary first (summary haters and those that don't wish to know anything about the plot please take that guy out into the woods & deal with him while I write the next paragraph).\r\n\r\nTom Reagan is advisor to Leo, the mob boss who runs things around here. Rival boss, Johnny Caspar wants Leo to give him permission to have Bernie Bernbaum killed because he's making problems for his gambling syndicate. Now Bernie's sister, Verna is seeing Leo and so Leo is reluctant to upset the apple cart (if you know what I mean). Also, Verna is seeing Tom on the side and if Leo ever found out about that there was gonna be some big trouble for him. Add to this the fact that, Tom is also a bit of a gambler and has run up quite a debt, but insists on paying it off without any help. So, one day Casper makes Tom an offer and, as you can probably guess, this is where all the fun starts... I hope you understand that lot! I'm gonna leave it there so as not to enrage the spoiler police too much.\r\n\r\nAs I said at the beginning, this film has a truly excellent script with some great dialogue and clever plot twists. It's a very well made film with a very appropriate soundtrack (you'll know what I mean if you've seen it). All the main cast put in very good performances; Gabriel Byrne as Tom Regan, Marcia Gay Harden as Verna, John Turturro as Bernie Bernbaum, Jon Polito I particularly liked as Johnny Caspar, Albert Finney as Leo and it was nice to see a cameo for Steve Buscemi as Mink.\r\n\r\nAlthough it has a great script, I found it didn't grab my attention the way other Coen brothers films have. Or maybe films have been made since that do what this does, but better. I don't quite know what it is, but this one seems to lack the punch that other Coen brothers films have. I felt that, although he is very good, Gabriel Byrne seems very subdued all the way through and this appears out of character for someone in his position. But aside from that, it's well worth seeing... Recommended (if only for Albert Finney wielding a Thompson Machine Gun to great effect). \r\n\r\nMy score: 7.5/10\r\n\r\nThere are extra bits & pieces (photos, links and bigger print) on my blog at:\r\nhttp://thoughtsofasteelmonster.blogspot.com/2011/03/film-review-millers-crossing-1990.html\r\n\r\nEnjoy!... :)",

            "content": "The Coen Brothers are up there on my list of favorite directors but I'd be lying if I said I thought they were one of the best. There movies often have imaginative stories and ideas behind them that come out a jumbled mess and especially in regards to the ending leave something to be desired. So you would think a movie that had a pretty solid and well told story, fantastic performances, a dark edginess too it and still maintained their quirky style would be one of the greats right? Regrettably not, you see this is one those early low budget offerings that became more popular later as the Directors popularity grew. All they'd done of note at this point were Blood Simple and Raising Arizona. The legend goes they wrote this story as a big epic noir film inspired by the works of Dashiell Hammett in the late 80s but took a break after suffering from writers' block, during which they wrote and filmed Barton Fink. After completing the script the Coens decided to film in New Orleans, the location in the movie is never said, but New Orleans has plenty of areas that haven't been changed since the 20s. So little known were they Joel has told tales of Police harassing them on the set, constantly asking for filming permits, and supposedly behaving like the cops in the movie. Not the most hectic production tale I've heard but it does raise the question how did something good come from this? Is it really their underrated best work you've never heard of, or is it just something movie geeks have latched onto? Let's take a look with gratuitous Tommy gun fire.\r\n\r\nThe movie follows Irish mob boss Leo O'Bannon (Albert Finney, who gives a fine performance and kicks some serious ass in this movie) is confidante Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne, in my favorite and easily his most quotable role) a smart strategist who is quiet, refined, contemplative and a wise ass. Leo has a relationship going with gun moll Verna Bernbaum (Marcia Gay Harden, in icy, playing hard to get mode) but unbeknownst to him she has a thing going on with Tom on the side. Meanwhile Italian underling Johnny Caspar (John Polito as the character in every gangster movie you enjoy, but has a nasty temper) is being screwed over in betting on races by bookie Bernie Bernbaum (John Turturro who was snubbed for an Oscar I tell ya!) and announces to Leo his plans to \"bump the schemata.\" Bernie is Verna's sister however so Leo decides to protect him from Caspar, and so it's war in true Tommy gun wielding prohibition era fashion.\r\n\r\nAll of this is explained in the opening scene, a Godfather riff between Leo and Johnny the sets the style and particularly killer dialogue for the brothers for the rest of the film. So as you can imagine, a few plot twists occur from here, and our hero Tom is right in the thick of it, alternately manipulating the people and situations to his advantage and going along for the ride which grips you for its entire blistering run time. The dialogue is the best the Brothers have ever produced, every exchange being a wonderful meld of words and all of them feeling like they have weight. The story is air tight and riveting, each plot twist rather than obscuring the narrative bringing it into sharper clarity for the jaw dropping ending. I also loved the heavy amount of visual symbolism the movie went for, most ostentatiously the fucking hat. What does it mean? The movie's opening credits roll over an image of it blowing into the forest, Tom loses it in a card game after which we learn of his and Verna's affair, there are an obscene amount of close ups on it, an numerous characters draw reference to it both Toms and just hats in general. Hell, Tom discusses a dream with Verna about chasing the hat but I'll be damned if I know what the fuck it means which doesn't make it any less intriguing. And the acting, my god sells the deal on this being such a great movie. The now famous scene where Tom marches Bernie into the woods at Miller's Crossing to execute him while he begs for his life is so fucking gripping and powerful because of the look of mixed emotions trying to be stony on Byrne's face and Turturro's chilling little freak out. But as much as I liked the side characters and supporting roles, no one intrigued as much as our hero Tom. He seems human, you can relate with him, admire him, find him witty and cool, but his motivation is so strange and changes so much you also are forced to question if he's genius or doesn't know what the fuck he's doing. But either way great character, great performance, great fucking movie.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, I found this to be successful, hell one of the Coens' most successful. I know many people not very fond of it but this movie hooked me in and for once with a Coen production I felt satisfied when the credits rolled. Hell, I felt the need to watch it again, four times in one month to be exact just to make sure I'd gotten all I could out of the film. For whatever reasons, maybe it's that I love characters like Tom who aren't afraid to be a smart ass in life or death situations, maybe it's because of the over the top action scenes that kept me intermittently entertained or maybe it's because of how many questions it raised I was eager to explore this movie had a profound impact on me and remains to this day one of my favorites, so I recommend you check it out if you haven't already.",

The Coens mine this masterfully crafted screenplay for both laughs, violence and a peculiar kind of, if not emotion or sympathy per se for their characters, then at least a lot of respect for their convictions. The script often displays a wicked glee in exploiting the style of the genre to test their characters limits. Byrne's Tom Reagan remains strong to his belief in \"ethics\" even if this leads him into a snake pit of twisted loyalties. It's this strong characterisation that helps keep you rivetted even if the plot throws you off like a bucking mule, which it will even if you play close attention - part of the fun is hearing that a minor characters death is dismissed as \"a mixup\" leading you a sigh of relief that perhaps keeping up with who did what to whom is not actually a priority. The Coens also deliver violent set pieces to match the sharp tongues, standout being Finney's Leo proving himself \"an artist with a tommy gun\". This, and the film as a whole, displays both a sincere yet also a calculated, tongue in cheek approach to genre, a very tricky tone to balance but the Coens nail it, aided by a pitch-perfect cast and technical polish.",

Miller's Crossing is a crushingly somber story of a man who doesn't want to chase his hat, but does so anyway.  Gabriel Byrne is a cold, calculating mob enforcer struggling to navigate the violent mob war between the Tommy Gun artistry of Albert Finney and the ethically obsessed Jon Polito.   And it's not just simply endlessly quotable like every other Coen Brothers flick, it's deliciously pornographically obsessed with hard heavy jazzy gangland language and the result is an aural landscape similar to the purple prose of HBO's Deadwood.  Watch out for the high hat, listen for the rumpus, and beware the gory hate of J.E. Freeman's The Dane.  It should also be noted that this is the last collaboration with cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld; he may not be as painterly as future collaborator Roger Deakins, but man, he perfectly captures the Rashomon forest and those handsome men in hats.

            "content": "I really do not understand high score for this movie. It didnt do much for me, even though im a big fan of gangster movies. They say this is the best after Godfather, well i can tell you this, difference between these two can be measured in centuries. Big difference...not even close.\r\nGood acting performance by Gabriel Byrne. The rest of the cast sleepwalks.\r\nBudget was 14 million and gross 5 million...hmm?....not much.\r\nCan NOT be serious gangster movie with only 14 body counts in total, come on!\r\nAlthough, shooting scenes were great, considering its 1990 movie.\r\nIncorrect - In the scene where Leo uses the Thompson sub-machine gun he should have had to reload at least 6 times. He did none.\r\nThe Dane calls Tom, \"Einstein\", for being so smart. However this film is set in the the 1930s, when the real Einstein hadn't done anything noteworthy to the general public yet in those years.\r\nTom is playing a game between two mafia bosses, now it seems like its either he is not sure about his loyalty or being super smart and already had this plan figured out from the very start. Mixed opinions there. Not believable.\r\nTom didnt want to kill Bernie because he is a brother of a girl who he sleeps with, and i understand that, its a moral logic, but at the end he kills him afterall, what happened to caring if girl which he loves will hate him for the rest of his life? He did care before. Hm....weird?\r\nFew fighting scenes, where next scene Tom's face doesnt have bruises. Makeup artist was off sick?\r\nSome scenes were just silly, no seriousness to gangster style.\r\nSeems like script was written how the movie goes along. Felt bored at some points by empty conversation scenes and drama pauses. \r\nNo suspense feeling at all.\r\nBoth mafia bosses are played soft and kind of dumb. Not really appropriate presentation of mafia boss.\r\nWhat was the hidden agenda with Tom's hat? His dream also? Millers crossing?\r\nThrough the first half was difficult to catch up with all the character's names thrown in your face.\r\nThere was no chemistry between the girl and Tom.\r\nAnyhow, some bits were entertaining, suppose to be intellectual gangster movie but for me just felt like dragging and dry. The film didnt manage to keep me interested throughout, at all. Sorry, but I just don't think Miller's Crossing is all that good.\r\nP.S. I will probably get slaughtered for this review but i feel brave and free to tell my opinion.",

            "content": "Miller's Crossing is a gangster drama set in prohibition era made by the ingenious Coen brothers. Unlike many others, I don't think this is Coen's best work yet it isn't anything much below their very high standard. I had occasional trouble with understanding some phrases or even words used in this movie but fortunately, it didn't take away too much from my experience. In fact, those phrases and certain words made the depiction of that particular era more realistic which is a good thing.\r\n\r\nThe story of this movie isn't a new one. It covers a well covered ground before, yet it isn't boring for one second. Not having experienced nearly enough gangster movies set in that era, with the troubles of some unfamiliar phrases as I said already, I was a bit lost in all the characters and their connections in the first half of the movie. I decided to start from the beginning with my concentration set very high and I must admit it was easier to follow it all on the second viewing (of the first half). It helped me fully comprehend this film.\r\n\r\nGabriel Byrne plays the title character here Tom Reagan. He is an assistant of the mob boss Leo running the town. As his right hand he plays a very large part in Leo's decision making. But throughout the film we realise more and more that he is actually just looking out for himself. Byrne is a good actor and I always thought that. My first experience of him playing a superb role was in End of Days. Yeah, I know. That movie sucks big time, but Byrne was one of the rare positive things about it. He played Satan and somehow it felt like the role was made just for him. Albert Finney played the Irish crime boss Leo and he was equally great. He has some particular badass scenes and he delivered with excellence. Not only that, his interactions with Tom were really great and with the right amount of chemistry. Jon Polito played the rival Italian crime boss Johnny Caspar and he was absolutely outstanding. I don't remember seeing him anywhere else but I can hardly believe he surpassed his character here. John Torturro played great too and many believe this is his best role right here as Bernie, a small time criminal just trying to stay alive. On the long list of superb actors playing in Miller's Crossing there is also brilliant Marcia Gay Harden as Verna. Bernie's sister and Leo's soon to be wife. She was gorgeous to look at but she matched her beauty with stout performance. One of my favourite actors, Steve Buscemi plays a very small part here too so I must mention him, oh and there are interesting cameos from Frances McDormand and Sam Raimi himself (I bet you won't guess who he is in the movie even when you do see him).\r\n\r\nSo to summarise, Miller's Crossing is a must see for every fan of the Coen's work and a good watch for anyone else wanting to see a fine movie with magnificent performances all round. It had some flaws in the plot itself and that's why my rating isn't higher but it really isn't anything big. And one more thing. You'll find plenty of cool quotes here and I'll just end my review with my favourite - \"What's the rumpus?\"",

In many ways, Miller's Crossing feels like the Coens' later film The Big Lebowski--it concerns a man who is somewhat of a loser who becomes slowly intertwined in a variety of different criminal plots that spiral out of control and threaten to drown him.    Femme fatales, antiheros, mob bosses, corrupt policemen, and all the other staples of film noir parade before the camera but always with a winking smile from the Coen brothers.  What results is a purely bad-ass, hilarious, and original piece of gangster cinema that could not have been created by anyone else.  Plus, Miller's Crossing brings a new twist to the genre by focusing on Irish organized crime.",

            "content": "8.2/10\r\n\r\n     \"Miller's Crossing\" is not amongst the Coen Brothers' best films, although it's close to being one. It just barely misses the perfection mark. Still, there is much to admire with this film. Visually, it is astounding. But it's also well written, often times humorous, well-acted, and intelligent; just as a Coen Brothers film should be. The film is a showcase of common Coen Brothers-fare, and that's why it's both good and imperfect. I love the Coen Brothers, so that is a good thing. But then again, nothing new means nothing interesting most of the time. Well, that does not go for the Coen Brothers. Just because their talents consist of great cinematography, an eye for acting talent, and great writing does not entail that any of it gets old. I love it as long as they keep the good stuff coming. However, they do not come without their flaws. But then again, that's what makes them so goddamn balanced whether half of their films are just barely escaping mediocrity or not. None the less, this is a great film from the duo; a smart period piece. This gangster drama may not be the most memorable cinematic experience, but in no way is it forgettable. I do not regret the experience; quite in fact I enjoyed (nearly) every moment of it. What can I say; the film was delightful, in a twisted/violent sort of way. You know: the usual Coen Brothers-fare. Reader be warned: this is not a good way to start with the Coen Brothers. Start with \"Blood Simple\", as I did long ago. THEN see this movie, for it is not worth a miss. That is unless you can't stand heartless movies such as this. Its own heartless tendencies drew me into the film. It is a paragon of pure interest from start to finish. Fun to look at, interesting to watch, and even more fun to absorb: that is what \"Miller's Crossing\" is. The only thing it isn't is a classic.\r\n\r\n           The Coen Brothers tell similar stories most of the time. One of them is that of a man (or woman) who takes on a personal quest which renders them down the path of eternal darkness over time. This is one of those stories. Tom Reagan is the confident of Irish Gangster-Political Boss Leo O'Bannon. When an Italian rival named Johnny Caspar shows up and expresses his wish to kill a man named Bernie, who is the brother of Tom's \"lover\", Tom expresses his own views on the matter. He says that he wants to protect Bernie, which greatly angers Caspar. Leo then goes to war with Caspar, throwing Tom into the middle of it. Tom eventually goes to work for Caspar, who shows him the dark side of criminal action. They capture Bernie and in the woods, he begs Tom for his heart and his forgiveness (best scene in the movie). When Tom fails to shoot Bernie and lets him go on his way, the matter is only complicated further. As it turns out, Bernie is not ready to go away. He comes back and attempts to blackmail Tom. This causes even more conflict as Tom attempts to get Caspar to go in for the kill. But...ah, screw it. It's not worth spoiling any more of the plot. This is a well written film and I wouldn't want to ruin the experience. I liked the execution and the outcome was satisfying. There were several outstanding moments of considerable power that stood out against the more typical moments scattered throughout, and that's why this movie works: because it has moments of high tension and emotion. I'd say this movie is completely heartless much like its main character, but a film of such artistic craft needs to have a heart to get by.\r\n\r\n       Gabriel Byrne is a talented man, as far as I can tell from his performance. Byrne gives off such good vibes in this film, playing such an intense and dare I say heartless character. And it takes a big character for me to call them \"heartless\". The word is not one I enjoy using lightly. I use it here only because the character himself claims that he is heartless. And according to definition, he most certainly is. But Byrne's performance has plenty of heart in it, at least enough to move it far towards greatness. John Turturro gives one of his most eccentric and interesting performances to date in \"Miller's Crossing\". When Turtorro's character begs the main character for mercy, there was such power in his fear and stuttering. I can't say I know what compels me to praise it so, but what the hell. I say it's memorable. Albert Finney gives a nice performance, as does the ever-so-delightful on-screen playfulness of Jon Polito. Otherwise, there are some very good cameos in this film, one of them being a couple good-earned seconds from Steve Buscemi. Let me tell you: he deserves more time than most people involved in this film. He is a great actor with great skills, and he's going to do great. Enough said.\r\n\r\n          The Coen Brothers make delightful films which are (mostly) delightful to watch. While most of them start out either lightly or heavily, each and every one has at least one bloody or violent scene in them. That is the Coen Bros' signature touch; a dash of darkness. In \"Miller's Crossing\", the darkness is imprinted in the film from start to finish. This film reminds me of how violent the Coen Brothers can get without going terrifically over-the-top. I like their sense of restraint without restraint. They are courageous men. \"Miller's Crossing\" literally caught my eye. It's as visually beautiful as any Coen Brothers movie, featuring more dazzling cinematography a minute than my eyes can typically handle at the moment. However, I was able to swallow all of it by the end. I cant' say that it was the most difficult thing to do. The original soundtrack/score was also pretty good, although by no means was it masterful. Most of the better pieces were the mellow ones, as on the contrary some of the better SCENES were the more intense ones. That's odd for the Coen Brothers, since some of the best stuff in their films comes out of silence. In this film it is not as so. Most of it comes out of scenes such as the begging-in-the-woods one as well as the baddass-old-man one. The elderly are back, and kicking loads of ass.\r\n\r\n           To fans of the Coen Brothers, definitely see this movie. Anyone else, see it too. If you are not entirely new to the Coen Brothers, that is. If you are, then go someplace else first. Start with one of their first GOOD movies (that means NO \"Raising Arizona\") and then come back to this beauty. Regardless of whether it's truly awesome or not, there's still a whole lot to consider with this film. It is very artistic visually and is a very well written gangster-period-piece. I like me a good period piece, and while this may not be one of the bests, I can say that it was worth my time. After all, who doesn't like good acting, good visuals, and good direction combined into one pretty-damn-great film? Not me. I like my films that way, as long as they are truly artistic. And \"Miller's Crossing\" is for sure an artistic film. So go on and see this movie, for while it is not one of the Coen Brothers' best films of epic perfection, it is still one of the good ones. Take it as you will.",

As a result, as well-crafted as it is it doesn't stick in the brain the way \"Blood Simple\" or \"Fargo\" or \"No Country For Old Men\" do, and is well behind those movies in the brothers' filmography.",

Cagney, Bogart, Edward G., and I bunch of others I can't think of right now. Let me tell ya, it's kind a hard to separate this movie from all those noir-y gangster pics. This may as well have been Gilda or something, some kind of passion-play from the late 30s about the good ol' days. Talk about a gorgeous lookin' movie, all that attention to set, those details, and those wonderful performances. Albert Finney really delivers something I never noticed twenty years ago when this came out: solid weakness. And that whole thing between him and Byrne. Nice. And of course Marcia Gay deserved all the accolades, as did Turturro and everyone else. I think at this point I'll watch anything with Polito in it. This guy is a classic supporting actor. He's the one that brings it all back to that other era, an era where the supporting cast was as interesting, sometimes even more interesting, than the main players. I went a bit cold on some of the Coen's later works, Serious Man brought me back, Miller's Crossing we love. We loved the music, pace, look of it, dialogue. The dialogue alone is a character, seamlessly a part of everything else. A big sprawling love-letter to classic film, a masterwork of sorts, near-perfect writing, entertaining, smart. What a classic movie is all about. Am I gushing?",

Nobody, and I mean nobody who writes and directs all of their own films has this kind of track record.  All but 4 of their films are original screenplays, not an easy feat.  I'm deeply in love with just about every one of their movies I've seen.  From Raising Arizona, to Fargo, to O Brother Where Art Thou?, all way the up to last year's True Grit.  They're amazing.  I've seen all but 4 of their films and the one that stands out as the most unique in style, tone and structure to me is Miller's Crossing in 1990.  Just about all of the Coen's films have their roots in film noir in some form or another.  Some have the look down pat (The Man Who Wasn't There).  Some take the genre and spin it into pure comedy (The Big Lebowski).  But in 1990, with their third film, they decided to go all out and just make a film noir gangster movie set in the film noir world.  Pre-War 1930s on the East Coast in a nameless city.  There's the Irish gangsters and the Italians.  When a war breaks out one man stands in the middle and plays both sides.  This is very much from the Dashiel Hammet novel The Glass Key.  \n\tThe movie is sensational.  You would never know that these 2 guys just made the wacky (and genius) comedy Raising Arizona just a film ago.  Miller's Crossing is one of the Coens' more adult films.  That is to say they make movies that everyone can like (Fargo, Raising Arizona or O Brother Where Art Thou?) and then they make movies that mostly people over 21 will like (The Big Lebowski or Barton Fink).  Miller's Crossing is not for everyone, the dialogue is very stylized.  It reminds me a lot of the way Deadwood was written, going to style rather than realism.  The violence is brutal, very brutal.  No cartoonish, but very gruesome.  Think Godfather with more violence.  But hey, if you like film noir and are in for a mature story with perfect acting and cinematic technique like I am then you'll love this.  If you want an action movie with minimal dialogue then please watch something else.\n\tMiller's Crossing came out in 1990 in between Goodfellas and The Godfather Part III.  The Departed could have come out in that shuffle and would have gotten lost.  But watching it as part of a series is the filmography of America's greatest sibling directors it stands alone as their crime epic masterpiece.  Catch it on Blu Ray and revel in the beauty of one of the finest pieces of screen violence.  Albert Finney takes on some guys breaking into his house with a Tommy Gun to the tune of Danny Boy and it almost makes me tear up.  What does make me tear up is a scene in the woods where John Turturro begs for his life, I've never seen an actor lose his @#$% so realistically.\n\tSo watch the movie, know it's a talky piece, but the 'action' will satisfy.  It's not for everyone, but everyone should watch it once.",

Leo is engaged to Verna even though Tom has been through all this trouble because of their relationship and when Tom is offered back his old position and is forgiven, he explains he wants none of that and he stands his ground as a sudden facial expression of realization sweeps over the face of Leo and he walks away. \n\nGood movie.",

Though there are many supporting characters with their own vendettas, political factions, and die hard approach to crime syndication, it's the singular path of Tom Reagan (Gabriel Bryne) that interests the watcher of this film. It's his actions that drive the rest of the film into fruition. The supporting cast is exceptional, beyond words or compare. Albert Finney is the mob boss who runs the unnamed city (the film was shot in New Orleans) with the full support of the city's mayor and police chief during the Prohibition era. He runs the rackets, a booze joint, and has Reagan by his side as his right hand man. Reagan himself is an enrapturing character, both quiet and reserved, and yet frightening in the fact that he has a fierce attitude under the surface. Though he seems not able to kill the men who cross him and his boss through his harsh conscience, he is dangerous, able to hit men with chairs, backstab anyone who is a direct threat, and change the entire political system of the city through blackmail, deceit, and faking deaths left and right. He even lets certain men who try to berate and reveal his true colors be beaten and killed for their efforts. The entire movie is an intricate plot filled melange of slight noir, gangster film, and period piece. The plot was so thorough that the Coens had to stop and write an entirely different movie just to get their heads clear. The film is filled with iconic scenes of murder, intrigue, and politics that amount to some very tense scenes. The entire film isn't all needless violence of course. The scene in the woods, one of the only examples of one scene hinging everything together, was poignantly bereft of violence and later came back to make the ending even more meaningful. The absolute badass of everything was when Finney escapes death while pulling some Godfather worthy stunts. Every aspect of this has the right mood, an understandable yet complex plot, and a great cast. One of the best Coen films of all time.",

Millers Crossing is one of their earlier works that is almost as good as any Coen Brother film I have seen to date.\r\nTypical of their films, the screenplay is just about faultless. The language style is extremely unique here. Unlike their later film No Country For Old Men, however, this film is just about saturated with dialogue. That is not a problem, but what could potentially be a problem for some viewers is that there is a lot going on with the plot. People are betrayed and double crossed and triple crossed and faking deaths and seducing gangsters left, right, and center. I had to pay apt attention to be careful to not get lost in the picture.\r\nBut I never was. It is not hard to pay attention to Millers Crossing because the story and characters are so interesting. They scream for attention to be paid to them, and I loved every minute watching them. The themes are typical Coen Brothers, but it is hard to find fault with a lot of this picture.\r\nIts also quite new, believe it or not. Even though its an old style gangster movie, the Coen Brothers are skilled enough directors that they can make it an old style gangster film while keeping the characters and themes and plots very modern in feel. This film keeps the old style alive with its style of language and murky set designs.\r\nBut I cannot downplay the engulfing nature of this story and characters. These filmmakers do very well with their direction and screenplay, and Millers Crossing is definitely a testament to that.\r\n9/10",

You can drift along with the characters and the things that happen to them, you can bury yourself with the suggestions of complex hidden meanings, you can goggle at the beautiful images, or you can relax and enjoy the action. You can even just enjoy the jokes and all the beautiful wardrobe and props. \n\nSo many things have to go right for a complex mobster movie to feel fresh and fluid, especially if it's set decades before the time of filming. All of those things went right in the making of this movie, and they seem to have just gotten lucky on top of it and gotten everything to work out just the way they wanted. \n\nNot too many movies stand up to viewing after viewing after viewing the way this one does. Even with so many moments that are kind of silly and overdone, just ripe spoofs of some of the cliched moments of classic gangster films, you still get fully sucked in and it never lets you go. There's something about the Coen brothers' style that allows them to get away with making fun of moments you've seen a million times in movies, or even replay them without making fun of them, while they still keep you rooted in the characters and action you're watching now. \n\nThey're always layering so much into every scene--you're getting to know the character, you're reacting to some interesting dialogue, you're catching crucial information about the plot, and probably seeing some beautifully composed shot all at the same time. As the shot unfolds, you realize the actors have to hit their marks exactly for the composition to hold together, while at the same time, you're keeping track of action and reaction. To add a comment on film history just deepens the events onscreen. When you're already layers deep, adding more just intensifies the complexity, rather than distracting.\n\nThere's not much to say about the elements of the plot itself that wouldn't spoil the fun of watching it all unspool. A dozen great actors offer work that's as good as anything they've ever done, they follow a plot that carries you along and holds together beautifully, the dialogue is eminently quotable. Gangster movies are a love it or hate it genre for so many people, but there's nothing else that even comes close to what the Coens did here.

He and I had never gotten to bond, really. As he was the oldest of three much older brothers, he left for college as my earliest memories were reaching real clarity. So having him move back in with Mom at the same time I did was an opportunity to plumb his vast knowledge of pop-culture. It is a period which, to this day, has shaped the way I look at movies, TV, and comics. \nI remember watching this, one of his favorite movies, and thinking that the hit-scenes were pretty cool, and wishing that Steve Buscemi had more time on-screen. Don't ask me why. I'm much older and wiser now, and last night after DVRing the movie off FMC, I got to watch it again for the first time with more refined and grown-up sensibilities. \nThis is a gangster story with Coen Brothers flair. It made me laugh to see John Polito as a Capone-style Italian gangster pleading his case in the beginning to the Irish overlord Leo to let him kill one particular thorn in his side as a matter of ethics. This kind of moral juxtaposition sets the tone for the entire film. It's a love story as well, albeit a tragic one. It's a drama with character in spades, and no shortage of comedy if you have an eye for the Coens' weird ability to stage shots in such a way as to make you giggle, even when you're not sure why. \nAny Coen Brothers fan or gangster movie fan who has not yet seen this twenty year old gem would do well to.

This film has everything that a prohibition movie should have: tommy guns, psychotic gangsters, speakeasies and a femme fatale. What brings the movie together is Gabriel Byrne. His subtle performance as a bitter advisor to a gangland chief is the real key. You hate him for being a son of a bitch turn coat but as the movie goes on, and everything unravels, you truly begin to see that he is a hero that does in fact believe in something. The homosexual undertone is a bit much, but it helps with the plot. A standout is John Turturro, the crooked bookie who begs for his life in the woods and then blackmails the man who spared his life. Albert Finney plays the tough but kind mob boss well and Marcia Gay Harden does a surprisingly good job playing the fem fatale, who takes advantage of the boss's soft side. Jon Polito does what he is good at, portraying a psychotic upstart italian mobster who is easily fooled. He does show range by showing the sympathetic, ethical side to this character, which eventually leads to his downfall. Unlike many gangster films, it has a happy ending. But we can forgive it since 95% of it is double crossing, guns blazing and violence. It is a gangster noir that deserves much more recognition than it has recieved. But thats what makes it special.",

Gabriel Burne's smooth talking right hand man is spot-on, with heavy weights Albert Finney and Jon Polito playing their respective mob-boss characters with equal intensity and power. Although this is one the Coen brothers earlier projects, you can still see their method at work - we are given a variety of characters, each one a unique piece in the massive game of chess the directors have concocted. The entire story bounces from character to character, each one adding their own influence to the continuation of the story yet mostly unaware of what is transpiring ourside their circle of knowledge. The only one who seems to keep it all in perspective is Gabriel Burne who simply smooth talks his way in and out of hairy situations like there was no tomorrow.\nThe overall pace is pretty fast, maginified mostly by the quick and snappy dialogue which is pretty impressive to begin with. Throw in some iconic music of the era and some pretty gruesome shoot outs and you get a mob story that is both memorable and compelling.",

The costumes look sensational and the sets are accurate to an age that is not revealed by is strongly hinted at to be pre 2nd world war through the guns costumes and dialogue.

Tom's secret relationship with Leo's gal pal, Verna Bernbaum played wonderfully played by Marcia Gay Harden in her screen debut will test his loyalty to Leo, he has a major falling out with Leo over Verna, he then forges a shaky alliance with Leo's chief rivals, a psychotic Italian mobster named Johnny Casper, played by Jon Polito in an impressive performance and his sadistic lieutenant Eddie Dane, played by J.E. Freeman in a solid turn who are threatening Leo's racket. Impeccable supporting performances from Danny Aiello III, Joey Ancona, Michael Badalucco, Steve Buscemi, Kevin Dearie, and Esteban Fernandez, with special kudos to John Turturro who delivers a noteworthy performance, as Verna's slimly gay brother Bernie Bernbaum. There is a tour-de-force scene of sheer filmmaking brilliance, when two Tommy gun armed assassins try to murder Leo in his own home, it is one of the finest gun battle action scenes i have ever seen, where Finney's kingpin character shows why he is still number one, it is a truly an unforgettable sequence. The period recreation is flawless, a intelligent and fascinating screenplay by Joel & Ethan Coen, there is stunning cinematography by Barry Sonnenfeld and a magnificent  production design by Dennis Gassner, Carter Burwell's musical score is quite beautiful. A must-see, intense and riveting a glorious entertainment. Highly Recommended.",

            "content": "You may notice I've rated Miller's Crossing 100%. There's a simple reason for that. I love this movie. As far as I'm concerned there isn't a single weak scene or moment. I can watch the entire hour & fifty minutes that make up this film without checking my watch or wondering how many minutes before it's over. Pick any cast member at random & you can describe it as their finest hour & if it weren't for a certain loveable burnout named Jeff Lebowski it would be the Coen's definitive masterwork.  \r\n\r\nWhy do I love it so? Well it strikes the perfect balance between comedy & drama. The story is multilayered but never descends into needlessly complicated convolution. In the simplest terms it revolves around sports betting & a power struggle between Irish & Italian crime bosses. The anti hero of the piece is Tom Reagan, played by a never better Gabriel Byrne, a gang lieutenant that has to navigate the increasingly complicated dealings of rival crime syndicates. The other standouts in terms of acting are regular Coen collaborators, Jon Polito & John Turturro  as unhinged Mafia don Johnny Casper & inherently sleazy bookmaker Bernie Bernbaum respectively. The cast (which also includes Albert Finney, Marcia Gay Harden & a small role for Steve Buscemi) is quality as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe dialogue is deserving of special praise, the characters interact in a quickfire patois that brings to mind the cinema of the 1940's. The characters never swear in the modern sense, the worst you'll hear is son of a bitch, instead exchanges have a unique noirish quality full of quips & putdowns. The quirkiness that often puts me off Coen's films when laid on too thick is present here but a perfect balance is struck. \r\n\r\nSpeaking of 40's noir throwbacks, the look of the film also brings to mind noir cinema. At times during interiors it's like watching an interior scene from the Naked City that's simply been shot in colour. As for exteriors the shots (especially those from the forrest) are just beautiful. There's a transition during the forrest scenes that's just a marvel to behold.  Bary Sonnenfield's (who went onto the direct (*shrug*) Men In Black) cinematography is more than a match for Roger Deakins.\r\n\r\nPeople talk about how at the 63rd Academy Awards Goodfellas was robbed by Dances With Wolves for best picture/director. Miller's Crossing was nominated for nothing that year. Nadda. Zip. S.F.A. In a year when an abortion like Ghost take's Best Original Screenplay. (That's Right, Ghost). The Coen's should by all rights have gotten their first oscar 17 years before No Country For Old Men. When you think about that, the Goodfellas debacle doesn't seem half as bad.\r\n\r\nWell I might be biased, as I said I LOVE MILLER'S CROSSING.",

The negatives are that there are two glaring plot holes that weigh the film down to a degree, and some of the plot could have been explained slower and better, it seems at times the Coens are in a rush to get it done.

Set during the prohibition era, the movie revolves around a right hand man of a powerful gang named Tommy (Gabriel Byrne).  This movie is very complicated, and definitely should not be watched while tired.  While there are a couple of action sequences in the film, it really relies on the characters to move the plot forward, which is a fresh look at the crime genre.  I personally thought John Turturro's performance as a Jewish Bookie gone bad was Oscar-worthy, and he really shines in this role.  I had absolutely no problems with this movie, every scene is great, meaningful, well-crafted and is essential to the plot.  As with most Coen brothers movies, the ending is very open-ended.  As the viewer, you can choose which characters you side with and which one's you don't.  Overall, a great film that will please any lover of the gangster genre, and also another solid entry in the Coen body of work.  This is an intelligent crime movie, made specifically for intelligent people, and I think that is why it didn't make a lot of money at the box office.  What does that say about America?",

I know I'm going to take flack for saying this, but I just think the movie tends to drag at times. In fact, there are moments that are chillingly quiet...and well...boring. However, the good far outweighs the bad, and the Coen brothers' wit mixed with a little Irish mobster thrill is a combination that is hard to criticize too harshly. Though I think much of their work is absolutely 100% perfect (Raising Arizona, The Big Lebowski, No Country For Old Men, etc.) this one just falls a tid bit shy of those films...great, but not perfect.",

Meanwhile, rivals Johnny Caspar and Eddie Dane threaten O'Bannon's racket.\r\n\r\nMillers Crossing is directed by the highly original Joel Cohen, and its pretty easy to tell, as there are many numerous look a likes in this film to countless others of The Coen Brothers. \r\n\r\nIn this film, there are many very good scenes that are just about being visually and emotionally captivating. Coen makes this film touch you but not with words or actions, but by the look of the film, and how you feel youre in this torn-down 1920s era of where gangsters and crime rule the town, and where everything is deceptive. \r\n\r\nIf youre looking for a good mafia film then look no farther. Many stereotypes in mobster films dont quite happen in here. We have always seen these tommy-guns blazing, but not with the kind of style this film gives us. The script is not like many other mafia films, as it is very realistic but also very challenging and complicated. \r\n\r\nThe reason its very complicating is because it starts off on the wrong foot talking about characters we do not know, and have no clue about. Probably about 45 minutes into the actual film is when we finally find out who all the players are. Many events in this film also happen, without us even knowing ourselves. I liked the little John Tuturro scene at first and felt that was good, but then it starts to over-play itself and just turned out to be a little too annoying. \r\n\r\nThe movie does have some pretty interesting scenes with some great violence and great visuals, but moves at a snails pace. There were way too many scenes that just featured these people talking, drinking, smoking, or anything else about gangsters. I felt like this film at points got boring, and does not do very well trying to pull its viewers in. \r\n\r\nMillers Crossing features a lot of big names that are recognizable, but arent in this film as much as you would think. Gabriel Byrne does a very good job at playing this lead and doesnt act tough throughout the whole movie, and actually does show some weaknesses within. Albert Finney, John Tuturro, and Marcia Gay Harden all are in this film and show up but are not used as well, and dont seem to powerful for a film that bases it all on the power of a look and feel. \r\n\r\nConsensus: Though not one of Coens best, Millers Crossing is a small mobster gem that is visually spectacular and features a real-life look at the world of the Mafia. \r\n\r\n7/10=Rentall!!!",

The rest of the cast, including Gabriel Byrne (who I swear drops his character's Irish accent for several parts of the movie) does just as well, albeit some may be a bit cliched.

At its heart, Miller's Crossing is a comedy. Its a dark comedy that uses all of the stereotypes of the genre to great effect. The humor is subtle. Very subtle. And that's the best part about it. It's a comedy that manages to be more serious and believable than any drama could.

            "content": "Realism isn't exactly a necessary component for successful filmmaking. In fact, a cornerstone of making movies, Hollywood or otherwise, seems to be the escape from the mundane and worldly, in favor of the exploration of the impossible and the fantastic, of distant places or long-past times. And though such imagination is commended, even celebrated, the discerning director must take great care to ensure that a world so divorced from reality remains connected to its viewers. But with \"Miller's Crossing,\" that tenet is one terribly lost on brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, who revel in narrative sleight of hand and self-indulgent complexity, allowing their audience no closer than arm's length.\n\nTo be fair, the story they have constructed here does have its merits, ranging from its distinctive wit to its undeniable style, both evidence of its authors' skill, but they are assets trapped within the body of a film that never engages its spectators, in large part because it never attempts to. Like its spiritual, if not direct, predecessor \"Blood Simple,\" the film displays the Coens' particular talent for constructing extremely memorable, highly-charged scenes, but the bulk of the foundation upon which they rest serves as, at best, an unsteady base.\n\nEnter Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne), the always-cunning brains behind the posturing of local crime lord Leo O'Bannon (Albert Finney), a man content to remain behind the curtain, but possessing more than the intellect to run things on his own. As the key player in this tale that owes as much to film noir as it does to the work of Dashiell Hammet, particularly Red Harvest, he takes a central role in the gang warfare that will soon sweep over the face of its unnamed city. Key struggles involve the conflicting loyalties, deception, and romance surrounding brother and sister Bernie and Verna Bernbaum (John Turturro and Marcia Gay Harden), but to say any more would risk spoiling some of the turns in its labyrinthine plot.\n\nIt's a plot that can at times move at breakneck speed, and is cruelly unforgiving in its minor details. Vitally important names are dropped so casually in dialogue so fast-paced you may find yourself wishing for a scorecard, or at least something to take notes on. From the very first scene, the viewer has the sense of being unceremoniously dropped into the heart of an intricate, deceit-laden atmosphere, without so much as the faintest of lights to illuminate its complexities.\n\nSophistication is one thing, but to feign intricacy by obscuring what should otherwise be clear details borders on narrative dishonesty. It's a lesson that the Coens' seem not to have been taught by the resounding success of \"Blood Simple,\" which suffered from similar storytelling duplicity. But like its forebear, \"Miller's Crossing\" manages to cull from its at times implausible storyline genuine moments of tension, terror, and drama. Though perhaps not quite as successful in this regard as its predecessor, these sequences offer up hard evidence that the talent behind the Coens' debut was by no means used up in one shot.\n\nWith regard to casting, Byrne can hardly be blamed for doing all that he can with a character so clearly the product of a screenwriter's pen. \nTurturro, on the other hand, positively shines as Bernbaum, who appears to be the only authentic, believable character amidst a swarm of stock noir cutouts. It hardly seems surprising, then, that following this, he's become something of a Coen regular, with key appearances in both \"Barton Fink\" and \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\" Steve Buscemi even puts in an all-too-brief appearance that will make you long for his more significant role in \"Fargo.\"\n\nIn so many ways, the film feels like the slow, inexorable progression of two growing filmmakers struggling to further define their strengths and vanish away their weaknesses. For the first time in their then-young careers, concrete manifestations of their distinctive grim humor, arguably among their most defining traits as directors, were beginning to emerge. Though it lacks the edge and originality of their debut, it casts off the predictable trappings of their previous \"Raising Arizona\" in favor of darker, more ambitious fare.\n\nIndeed, \"Miller's Crossing\" makes the all-too-rare mistake of asking too much of its viewers, while so often, contemporary films rarely make so much as an attempt to intellectually challenge their audiences. And for that, despite its flaws, of which it certainly has many, one must afford its effort due respect. Though it doesn't succeed in making good on its ambitions, the Coens' attempt is to be applauded, for they reach and come up short where so few even extend a hand at all.",

This story is about the mob of New York in the late 20's. The main character, Tom(Gabriel Bryne), is the advisor of the most powerful irish crime boss of the city(Albert Finney). But soon their friendship is going to fall apart because of a woman(Marcia Gay Harden). Because of that and due to his large debts he goes to the other side offering his services to the only competitor of his ex-boss(Jon Polito). I'm not going to reveal any more of the plot because this is one of these plots that have an amazing and magical way to fall into place. You will find yourself almost in any place taken by surprise. The film blends two film genres. The gangster epic and the noir film. This along with a big amount of the Coen style leads to something that you'll hardly ever see again. As I already mentioned the Coen stamp is everywhere. The camera angles and all the wonderful settings say so and so does the script. The characters are unique with Jon Polito's and John Turturro's standing out. I think it's great that the Coen brothers gave Polito a leading role because so far I've seen him in their movies playing small roles that were not very good in showing the full extent of his talent. This really is an excellent acted film but I find hard not to mention that Polito and Turturro were a lot better than the rest, taking their character to a really great level. Another thing that makes this film stand out is how the human side of the gangsters is shown. Usually in gangster epics the main character is so smarter, stronger and in general better than the rest (except maybe for the main antagonist) that it ends being a little bit unfair for the other's. This isn't the case here though because Tom is for the whole duration of the movie walking on a tight rope and luck really plays a significant role to his action and saving his ass. The main antagonist here(J.E. Freeman) is really way smarter than him and also a few more characters put him in really tight situations. So in conclusion what we get here is a witty Coen brothers film, an amazing gangster epic and romantic drama. You really can't get much better than this.",

With his dark fedora and his loner demeanor he's sort of the epitome of the stereotype for the \"man on his own,\" and the Coen Brothers are aware that they're playing with this stereotype, so they make it almost mythological.\n\nGabriel Byrne is great, but this is also one of my favorite Turturro roles.  He's a charming, fast-talking liar and conman, and he does his job playing a cold bastard with a giggly exterior marvelously.\n\nBut you really can't say enough about all the various performances, which is usually true with Coen Brothers movies.

That's why it's taken me so long to get to this early Coen brothers production, and I should've guessed that they would bring something fresh to a stale setting.  While the directorial flair is more restrained than usual, the serpentine story elements slither in every direction, so complex that I was reminded of 'The Big Sleep.'  However Barry Sonnenfield was still manning the camera helm so there are some trademark shots.  \n\nGabriel Byrne is the best I've ever seen him as a completely self-serving bastard, except for one act of conscience that in a darkly ironic twist comes back to bite him as there are characters even MORE souless!",

            "content": "A fairly authentic prohibition-era gangster flick with under-tones of dark humor and irony. Joel and Ethan Coen have created a masterful and believable gang war staged against a 1930's back drop. Being a Coen brothers' film there is a possibility some people will not see it on the principle of that fact, but I assure you this is unlike any other film the brothers have worked on. The cast is quite phenomenal with Gabriel Byrne and Albert Finney promoting the strongest of performances. Leo(Albert Finney) is an empowered Irish crime boss who seemingly begins to lose faith in his own ability to control the city when his judgment is clouded by love and a rival crime boss is trying to take over. Tom Reagan(Gabriel Byrne), Leo's right hand man attempts to alleviate the situation but to Tom's dismay only complicates things for himself, which results in him being kicked out of the crime family. From here Tom appears to be going on a seemingly wild goose chase which ultimately leads to a satisfying yet traditional climax. \"Miller's Crossing\" could have been a bit more gritty with it's camera shots and little more forgiving with it's sometimes complex dialogue, but those are fairly minor gripes compared to the movie as a whole. I highly recommend this to anyone that has a passion for mob/gang related films, as this is quite possibly one of the best.",

In true Coenian fashion, there are no \"likable\" characters here and nothing ends up the way you think it will.\n\nAs usual, the dialogue sparkles and the visuals are incredible. Shots soaring through trees are enough to take your breath away. Brutal, unremitting violence suddenly erupts out of normal conversations. Humor comes from the most morbid of subjects.
