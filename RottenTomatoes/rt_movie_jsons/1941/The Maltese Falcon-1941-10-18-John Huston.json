            "content": "It's incredible to think that The Maltese Falcon, one of the most influential and popular film noirs of all time, was directed by a newbie. John Huston is a big name now, but back then this was his directorial debut. The film has all the elements you'd expect from the genre: hard boiled lead character, male characters wearing what looks to be the same suit and hat, beautiful but transparently untrustworthy women in danger, a story full of twists and turns, dark rooms, low angle shots and a liberal helping of alcohol and cigarettes. Humphrey Bogart cemented his star-status in this role, and his onscreen person would be imitated by countless others. A man with a voice like his was born to play this kind of part. It's got a great supporting cast too, with many big names contributing to the occasionally confusing plot. For me the script was a bit too excessive, and some of the confrontations went on a bit long. It's also distracting that the eponymous falcon apparently weighs so much because it's made of precious metal and its surface is diamond-encrusted, but it's clearly light enough to be handled by the cast members, and not bumpy, as you'd imagine something studded with diamonds to be. In terms of film noir, I definitely prefer Double Indemnity and especially Touch Of Evil, finding their stories and characters more compelling overall, but The Maltese Falcon is a cinematic classic for a reason, and one I very much enjoyed watching.",

Hard-boiled cynicism, fallible protagonists, blood-curdling avarice, and labyrinthine plot developments pave the way for an infinitely absorbing and ultimately unforgettable work about the persistence of delusion and the negotiable price of human loyalty. The film's gritty aesthetic washes over you as the web-like story grips you in its sticky tendrils, all the while leaving the unmistakable impression that you are witnessing something truly historic.

Mary Astor is pretentious and overdramatic while Boggie comes across as a caricature. There is a very weak plot and little suspense or action in this film noir.  The characters just shuffle back and forth between the PI's office, a hotel, and the PI's home. Everyone is lying, threatening, and bribing each other while trying to gain possession of an expensive statue of a falcon. The film is a mess! There are many plot holes and ludicrous scenes of characters pulling guns and childishly smacking each other. It's actually laughable at times.  To make matters worse, the two leads have no chemistry and there is no character development which makes the love story a complete joke. Honestly, except for getting to cross this off my movie bucket list, it's barely worth the time IMHO!  (I read that the 1931 original is much better)",

Humphrey Bogart with his dry delivery and cleverly written lines shines without a doubt while Mary Astor failed to captivate me as she captivated our protagonist.

This move proved just as well sighted as the casting, and I am not sure if the resulting scripts tightness was due more to this being Huston's first big directing job or his recognition of Hammett's genius when it comes to the genre. The fast talking tough guy with a heart which Bogart embodies comes off near perfectly as Sam Spade while Greenstreet, Astor and Lorre offer excellent supporting work. The plot Hammett cooked up is such an entertaining and dizzying little mystery that, and thankfully Mr. Huston agreed, doesn't require much artistic license from anyone else.",

It starts promisingly enough, with Bogart's friend being murdered by someone. Then, Peter Lorre is introduced and the movie goes downhill. Even the most uneducated random person on the street talks like an academic with a Masters in English, the fat villain is extremely clumsily developed to the point where he becomes a clown and the tense, violent moments are non descript.

And those black and white films I watched at school and college were tinny with flat frames, austere music and silly, boring, cheesy dialogue. But as soon as I finished The Maltese Falcon, a film I found on my own, working my way backwards through hardboiled and detective fiction and films I was interested in, it had blown my mind.\n\nQuintessential early film noir; it's a stage play locked into some beautiful environments with some electric characters that pop up, chew scenery, rock Sam Spade's world and then wait in the wings until called upon again. The easy, watchable charm of The Maltese Falcon always has me coming back. It's not a particularly involving film, nor is the mystery very satisfying, but instead it's just a very easy film to follow, and an easy film to watch. It's not got too much of the pep of later film noirs, it's not as cheeky, but it is classy. It's a non-politicised, non-romantic Casablanca. It's boiled hard and beautiful, biting and subtle. There's as much not-said between the dialogue as there is said, Bogart's tiny, hard, jewelled dead eyes that still manage to sparkle.\n\nSan Francisco has a refreshing feel; the more manicured and professional stiffness of Sam Spade and his world is a companion piece to the cheap comedy and acerbic empty wit that Philip Marlow and his Los Angeles brings in some of those equally popular film noirs.\n\nAlso, considering that it's allegedly a verbatim copy of the source novel, there's nuance and vibrancy in every scene and every moment.

The best thing about The Maltese Falcon is the atmosphere in it, the ambience; the dialogue itself is often ridiculous (it's no wonder this has been parodied in joke form for so many years) and the story is convoluted as hell, with the 100 mph dialogue only making it more difficult to understand at times.\nThere are far worse movies, though this semi-incomprehensible movie being rated so extremely highly is just ridiculous. It's not Bogart at his best by any means - see The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre for that.\nThere are worse films, but this ain't a great one, just interesting. Again, more mood than actually a great story; it gets by from its reputation and its \"coolness.\" It's all a pose...and if you can take it as that, you may enjoy it more than I did.",

            "content": "Often referred to as the first real film noir this film launched Humphrey Bogart to superstardom and served as the directorial debut of the legendary John Huston who would go on to produce other masterpieces like The Dead (1987) and Fat City (1972). There is so much to appreciate in the film as it really does set out all of the iconic tropes that would become staples of the noir genre and yet it is a weird little film for one that is so often quoted as I could not name another film that is quite like it. It hasn't aged a day in 78 years and is still an entertainingly dark tale of a group of sad, desperate people.\n\nPrivate investigator Sam Spade, Humphrey Bogart, works with Miles Archer, Jerome Cowan, but is having an affair with his wife Iva, Gladys George. The two are employed by the mysterious Ruth Wonderly, Mary Astor, who asks them to tail Floyd Thursby, a man she claims is threatening her sister. The two men do not believe her story but take on the job anyway leading to Archer being murdered by an unknown killer. Spade becomes a primary suspect due to his affair with Archer's wife and when he discovers that Thursby was also killed the night of the murder he realizes he is part of a larger conspiracy. Wonderly provides him with some help when she reveals that she is actually Brigid O'Shaughnessy and was in cahoots with Thursby and he later connects her to the imposing Joe Cairo, Peter Lorre, who is looking for the Maltese Falcon. Cairo is employed by Kasper Gutman, Sydney Greenstreet, whom Spade was already familiar with and when the dying captain of a ship drops off the Maltese Falcon in Spade's office. Sadly this item is not the real thing and this creates more conflict between the members of the motley crew that have assembled.\n\nBogart was the big surprise for me here as I was not entirely sold on him from his work in Casablanca (1943), a film I find to be highly overrated, and his overstated work in The Desperate Hours (1955). I found him refreshing here as while he has a reputation for being dark and brooding he played Spade as a character who is wounded, damaged and laconic, prerequisites for a detective in a film noir, but also as a man with a sense of humor and self awareness. He knows that it is unwise getting taken in by the charms of Astor and when she spouts off her tall tales he is able to chuckle at how silly it all is. He is helped by a fantastic screenplay of course as this film forces him to really build a character instead of relying on the Bogart-isms that later roles would require of him. He seems to exist outside of space and time as he is a man who always seems to have been old and weathered despite this being relatively early in Bogart's career and his mannerisms and gestures are still replicated by men today.\n\nThe film also uses it's tropes to great effect and even subverts a few as the femme fatale in this film is presented differently than many future versions would. Astor seems like an unlikely casting choice as she doesn't have the glamour of Ava Gardner in The Killers (1946) or Rita Hayworth in Gilda (1946). Yet this plays into her hands as she is able to sell herself as a vulnerable, self destructive woman to a man who does not know what he wants or needs. We feel incredibly nervous towards the end of the film as we worry that our lead's love for this woman will outweigh his devotion to his job and I have rarely been so gripped at the end of the film. This is a tribute to the way that the character is written as she avoids most clich\u00e9s to become a unique cinematic achievement that etches herself permanently in the minds of viewers.\n\nThe gorgeous cinematography of Arthur Edeson also deserves mention as he practically defines the visual style that would dominate the genre with plenty of light streaming through windows and characters surrounded by darkness. It is fortunate that Huston assembled such great talent as he brings them together for a film worthy of their talents.",

It was one of the best experiences I've had in a theater. We arrived early and we were the only patrons in the theater until a few minutes before the start of the film. The 6 other people who arrived were very quiet and respectful during the whole thing. The movie was amazing! The acting, dialogue, and direction was awesome! It was interesting to watch a film from 1941 (53 years before I was born) at the movie theater. The aspect ratio being 1.37:1 was especially cool to see in such a blown up screen. I will definitely be purchasing the Blu-Ray soon and re-watching it. Even my wife enjoyed it. I would highly recommend watching this if you haven't before.

A lot of directors have come and gone, but none of them was just reading it to you, tucking you in, he whispers the book in his infamous adaptation like it is his, the director's, John Huston. The story, if you are aware of it, has been wielded before too, but it didn't come out this durable and.. well, shiny. The narration is a bit tricky in here, since it is something that would- I wanna say be better if on paper, because it is and it was good- resist if exaggerated.\n\nThe scenarios, the characters, the entire tone of this film-noir is bound within four walls. It ping-pongs here are there with \"He said. She said\" affair where as an audience you are in a rush to figure out what actually is going on or has been going on in this first act. After which the film reveals all its cards and we relaxed back in our seats, hoping for something \"Bang!\" to go wrong. But it doesn't. This is where the film cheated me the most and left me in awe of it.\n\nFor if I think about it I never wanted it to go wrong or right or in fact anywhere. Huston's filmmaking is so present in that room where around three to four major characters are sitting around or roaming about that you don't want this day to end. Anticipation is the game then, and the tease, is Huston's key to success. Watch how a simple phone call or a knock on the door pumps up your heartbeat fast, scared, hoping that it wouldn't collapse, \"The stuff that dreams are made of.\" The Maltese Falcon is as good as any historic event, I say claim it history and be done with it.",

            "content": "A film noir with no sentimentalism.\n\nJohn Huston's The Maltese Falcon (1941) is a classic example of film noir with overly sentimental attitude. Characters are blunt liars and selfish scum. There are few decent people in The Maltese Falcon as everyone is out for theirs. Huston's script is full of clever wit, dry humor, and cruel betrayal.\n\nHuston's direction is clean, dark, ambient film noir at its finest. Many of the shots with Humphrey Bogart are as dark and revealing as cinema gets. The way Huston lets a shot still to engage the audience with his characters is impressive, especially as the editing is quick and the film goes by quickly. The Maltese Falcon's hour and a half running time feels like a half hour. It's brisk storytelling is amplified by its complex narrative and endless twists. I will not spoil any of the genuinely surprising moments.\n\nHumphrey Bogart is a great star and a formidable actor. His monologues and rage sear the screen with his ferocious acting. Bogart's performance as Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon ranges from nuanced detective with a sly and knowing manner to a fierce tempered brash man of action. He is interesting and captivating without having to be likable at all really. Bogart's noir detective is one for the ages!\n\nMary Astor may overdo it a bit, but she captures the nebulous ways of a woman in distress looking out for herself. Her endless string of lies is so entertaining as Bogart uncovers them one by one, while never quite figuring her out. Astor is certainly intriguing and alluring as Brigid O'Shaughnessy.\n\nPeter Lorre is hilarious and funny as the sleazy and creepy Joel Cairo. You will never forget his charming and quirky Cairo character. Lorre is both convincing as his strange characters, while also entertaining you with his mystery and commitment.\n\nLikewise, Sydney Greenstreet's massive character Kasper \"Fat Man\" Gutman is excellent. His fascinating monologue over the history of The Maltese Falcon is riveting. He evens summarizes the plot towards the end with an underhanded sneer and distinct delight in his voice.\n\nOverall, Huston's film noir The Maltese Falcon is an entertaining movie with many great attributes. It's not completely mesmerizing or so perfect in performances that everyone is a star. But, The Maltese Falcon is great for a watch and a display of complicated writing.",

The detectives believe neither Miss Wonderly nor her story, but they believe her money. Since Archer saw her first, he takes the case -- and later that evening he is shot to death, as is the mysterious Thursby.

It is talky, claustrophobic and perfectly cast as played.\n\nWhat lifts it above others is the sheer originality and moral complexity of the tale. This is an attack on crass materialism and human depravity that has no peers. All of the characters - except Spade occasionally- are lying all the time, in pursuit of money, sex and power. The Black Bird is itself the great existential bluff, a non-existent cause for action, that symbolises the naked aggression and powerful greed. Spade is the first true anti-hero, uninterested in fame or money, a man possessed by the need to revenge his partner using any means possible.  Like all Hammett leading men, he has his own moral code, one that requires him to spit in the face of authority and get his way no matter what.\n\nThis is the first film I watched as a child, and decided, this is beyond me, this is an adult world I don't understand. It still has the power to shock. The femme fatale lies all the time, uses men and packs a gun. The cops are dumb bullies. The DA threatens Spade in a blatant abuse of power. The crooks are gay, ruthless and cultured. The gunman who does most of the killing is the young boyfriend of the lead villain, the Fat Man. \n\nIt really is the 'stuff that dreams are made of - sharp as a tack today as it was in 1941.",

            "content": "I enjoy antiheroes who have to take a whole movie to do anything remotely moral - that's Sam Spade, played as cool and tough as Humphry Bogart knows how.  His sly bravado, tough with police and women, seemingly careless attitude with the death of his partner Archer, make him a questionable character throughout.  He has various affairs, including Archer's wife, which we learn after the poor bastard's been shot.  I more than half expect Spade will end up just as corrupt as the adversaries he is forced to help, and I'm not far off.  His last act is just, but he does it cruel; he's not out to win the audiences heart, just his own.  It's the best way he can make up for his apathy towards Archer.  They cut through the Hollywood cliches with him, and the end kiss is far from romantic or resolving, rather just a tease for what won't be.  That's the kind of character I like to see, but I suppose too often would water it down.  Good to have these types rare.\n\nBut the key to making this whole picture work is the trickster, Brigid O'Shaugnessy, who goes by other names to start.  She is a compulsive liar, her ultimate goal never quite clear, nor her feelings, which she may have none besides greed and/or fear.  She always keeps us guessing.  And once we feel settled into one version of the truth, it changes - that happens all through the show, right till the very end.  And if that doesn't captivate, nothing will, because it's the essence of the film's mystery.\n\nPeter Lorre is wildly entertaining, somewhat comic relief, by far the best of the antagonist bunch, if you exclude O'Shaugnessy for being in between.  He plays Cairo, a not-so-tough baddie for the Fat Man on the hunt for Maltese Falcon.  He tends to get his ass kicked by Spade.  As does Fat Man's right hand \"like a son\" Wilmer, played wonderfully by Elisha Cook Jr, using the same pastiche that make most his other roles work in context; his psycho lemur stare, supersensitivity, frustration, and dumbness.\n\nI am not familiar enough with Huston to weigh his work as a director, but I like his staging, the body language he gets from his actors.  But in conjunction with camera?  Not so much here, which is part of my lacking 5 stars.  I didn't love the cinematography, and noirs are typically an easy sell for me.  I didn't think the photography grabbed me at any particular moment.  The attitudes of the actors did that.  \n\nWhat the actors didn't convince me of was the violence, which at some points was strong, and others just plain awkward, as are most movies of this time.  Not Cagney, he can hit - but these folks had some strange moves, including the neck hit and straight jacket manuever on Wilmer.  The latter straight jacked move I liked, funny and interesting, but Spade has a bad habit of handing guns back; he does it with Cairo and Cook.  It's a statement of his confidence; he needn't worry about another carrying a gun, and later in the film tells us that it's a talent of his to snatch them - I guess he does it for sport, he enjoys the thrill.  And so does the audience.\n\nI've always known one part of this film, the end line when Spade answers the police about what Maltese Falcon, a fake, is: \"it's the stuff that dreams are made of.\"  Whenever I saw that in a greatest movies highlight reel, it moved me.  In the film itself it confused me, felt contrived, moment-grabbing.  I'm sure there's various explanations, and it's simple enough, but maybe a bit too heavy.  More like it's the thing nightmares are made of, since that's what this journey, and all the people hurt along the way, has been.",

A couple of murders later, Bogart comes to understand she and others are searching for a priceless antique, a statue of a falcon (from Malta, naturally).   Bogart must navigate the waters between the police, who suspect him, the various tough guys, one of whom is the fantastic Peter Lorrie, and Mary Astor's character, who he's attracted to, but knows he cannot trust.   Along the way, he'll blow smoke in a guy's face, take and give punches, and deliver several good lines, my favorites of which were \"When I slap you, you'll take it and like it\", and of course, the last one, in response to being asked what the falcon statue was, saying it's \"the stuff dreams are made of\".  It's regarded as a classic, but for me it's good-not-great.   I think one of the issues is the connection to Astor, I didn't see any real chemistry between the two of them, rendering a couple of the scenes false.  It's certainly worth watching though.",

Sydney Greenstreet's bizarre elocution of the English language is equally comical and Peter Lorre would seem menacing only if he had Boris Karloff along side him. And speaking of a weird butchering of English, Mary Astor's always almost-on-the-verge of fainting Brigid is pretty funny too. The script is peppered with what are nowadays cliches but must have seemed very hackneyed when the film was first released.\nI'm not saying that The Maltese Falcon is a horrible film, and would have watched it even if it wasn't a requirement of a film studies class. But it isn't a great film and of course everyone is sold on the movie star constellation developed by Hollywood which, like the real universe, seems to expand further and further with each generation.",

Want a slice of dark characters in classic cinema? then Maltese Falcon is here for you. Humphrey Bogart gives a fine and powerful performance and his character is extremely similar to that of Eastwood's in A fistful of dollars, one who keeps his side safe first before doing any goddamn thing. It's full of great dialogue and much tension is developed verbally between the exchanges of these dialogues between the characters. A great film with fine acting and wonderful suspense.",
