    "summary": "When a reporter is assigned to decipher newspaper magnate Charles Foster Kane's (Orson Welles) dying words, his investigation gradually reveals the fascinating portrait of a complex man who rose from obscurity to staggering heights. Though Kane's friend and colleague Jedediah Leland (Joseph Cotten), and his mistress, Susan Alexander (Dorothy Comingore), shed fragments of light on Kane's life, the reporter fears he may never penetrate the mystery of the elusive man's final word, \"Rosebud.\"",

Orson Welles deliberately obliterated the accepted style of filmmaking in Hollywood at the time, and in doing so created one of the first great masterpieces with sound. Welles' own sprawling performance is the centerpiece of the film. Without Welles as the titularly immortalized character, the film would work merely as substance without the depth of his performance. It is also safe to say that Citizen Kane is one of the best debut films of all time, if not certainly the best. There is no higher praise that this film can receive that it has not already been given, and for excellent reasons.",

The performances are certainly great, especially of Orson Welles himself. The story itself was solid, I definitely found that 3rd act was heads above the rest, especially that ending, the rest was solid work.

Looking back on the film that introduced everyone's favorite green ogre to the world, it's easy to lose sight of just how big of a sensation it was. Besides being a critical and commercial smash hit, the film played in the competition for the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival and went on to win the first-ever Best Animated Feature Oscar at the Academy Awards. Shrek 2 had a long road ahead of it if it wanted to match this success, let alone top it.\n\nAs the Disney renaissance dwindled after a historic run of animated films in the 90s, Shrek's irreverent brand of humor and pop-culture references perfectly captured cultural fatigue with the Disney princess films. After a decade of Disney films where heroines scoured the ends of the Earth in search of true love, Shrek gained its power by being the antithesis of all that.",

The cinematography is enough to earn the film's reputation, every shot, every angle is exemplary and has so much visual drama, and you never know from looking at Citizen Kane that it was made on a shoestring budget. That is not all though. Bernard Hermann's score is superb, the story while not easy to understand at first is interesting and the screenplay is thought-provoking. Not only does Orson Welles direct impeccably, he turns in a magnificent performance as Charles Foster Kane, while the supporting acting is excellent too. People may dismiss Citizen Kane as boring and dull, and I have known people outside of IMDb to say that, but I have yet to hear any of those people to say it is not well-made or directed. As for me, I loved this film very much, and while my praise doesn't completely go beyond sheer admiration I cannot deny it is a great film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

I loved the way it was lit, the use of chiaroscuro- with so many of its characters drawn in silhouette and shadow gives the film the perfect visual aid for its narratives mystery. Also ahead of its time was the non linear narrative arch- and in particular Kane's 'breakfast scenes' with his first wife were really great. But I just didn't engage with or like any of the characters and as such didn't care at all what happened to them. The meaning of 'rosebud' wasn't one I was interested in, as I didn't care about Kane. Kane's descent from young idealist to self-interested megalomaniac certainly draws a lot of interesting parallels with today's billionaires controlling our news, and Welles performance is tour de force, but the whole film was delivered like a news story in a tabloid and didn't have enough heart or soul for me.",

His estate, which he named Xanadu, was massive and insanely expensive. He had his own zoo, collection of old relics including paintings and statues, and his whole castle/palace was built out of pure marble on top of a winding mountain. Very lively and electric the way they're presenting the story and all the information about Kane. Respect towards Charles Kane, he's one of the wealthiest people in the world and still wants to run a newspaper inquirer in order to inform the public of the truth. Omg, Rosebud was the name of the sled he had as a child! The last thing he had as a child before he got moved out to New York and left his mother and father. The whole time he just wanted to go back in time and be a kid again. That last scene with the sled burning was probably the most powerful one in the whole movie. It answers everything and brings everything full circle. It's brilliant really. \n\nMeticulously and masterfully filmed with a keen attention to detail. This movie is filled with creative ideas in terms of technicality and cinematography. It's innovative for it's time and definitely ahead of it as well. The atmospheric lighting, the way the camera moves, the way the story is presented - it's all brilliant. The set designs are impressive and grand. 20 minutes in and I can already see why this movie is regarded as one of the best. With all that being said though, it isn't the most entertaining, fun or thrilling story. It's actually kind of gloomy and miserable. One in which we see the demise of someone who could've made a difference but squandered it instead with foolish decisions because of their pride, ego and selfishness. Kane's life became an empty one, a meaningless one towards the end. Where he filled his void with buying material things like statues and art. Quite somber and dreary really. \n\nAll Kane wanted was to be happy. He longed to go back to being a child again, when he lived with his mother and father simply playing in the snow. To actually have a childhood and a normal upbringing. The reason none of Kane's closest friends knew what rosebud meant was because he never opened up to them about it. He never opened up to anyone. No one ever really knew the real Charles Foster Kane. He was a very closed off person. A very sensitive and hurt person who hid the pain well. It's quite a dreary and sobering movie but one that also has a very meaningful and important message. I can see why it's regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time, but honestly, this isn't a movie that I would be itching to watch again for fun. This is more of a movie you watch to learn from whether it's with the story or the innovative movie techniques used throughout like the editing, cinematography, and special effects. Overall, I thought it was a masterfully crafted movie with a meaningful message, it left an impression on me. I'd like to watch it again sometime.",

I also liked what they chose to do with his relationships and the deeper meanings that the film chose to explore about love and what it means for the person giving it and receiving it.\n\nHowever, the main story is not really interesting and did not fascinate me at all. The newspaper business is hardly something I'm interested in and the main character was only relatable in just a few scenes. Many people say this is objectively the best film ever made, and I think that's unfair since there's now 80 years worth of films that have come out since then. What's the point of having a favorite or appreciating something new if it can't concretely ever measure up to something from the past?? Film is something that's meant to adapt to the time period in which its production takes place, and while this movie might've greatly dazzled many in the past, I think there's a lot of merit to appreciate other things even more that came after it. It's important to appreciate what it did for film but I refuse to get hung up on its significance and dismiss most other subsequent amazing films like some have been guilty of doing.",

The guy babbles on and on and for the 40 minutes I coiuld stand of it, is as boring as one could imagine. Nothing happens!  This brings me to Citizen Kane.  Forgive me for not having enough patience with it maybe, but I tried watching it twice, and both times I had to turn it off within the first 20 minutes.  I know movies sometimes take a while to get going.  I like some classic movies ('It's a Wonderful life', '12 Angry Men', and 'How Green Was My Valley' are among my favorites).  But this entire storyline is about as boring as a movie can get.  Is it about newspaper guy? Politics?  I don't know. What I do know is I've seen over 700 non-animated movies in my lifetime, and I'd say half or more are not very good.  But they all kept my interest enough to keep watching.

That is not all though. Bernard Hermann's score is superb, the story while not easy to understand at first is interesting and the screenplay is thought-provoking. Not only does Orson Welles direct impeccably, he turns in a magnificent performance as Charles Foster Kane, while the supporting acting is excellent too. People may dismiss Citizen Kane as boring and dull, and I have known people outside of IMDb to say that, but I have yet to hear any of those people to say it is not well-made or directed.

This movie is about the life of Charles Foster Kane, and the meaning of his last words: \"Rosebud\". Citizen Kane is so important because of the technical accomplishments made which were incredibly revolutionary and ahead of their time. The use of lighting is incredible, using dark and heavy shadows during sadder moments, and the opposite for more jovial moments. The use of lighting is extremely effective in the opening scene, using dark shadows covering the bodies to create a mysterious silhouette, with a perfect amount of light around them to make them visible.\n\nWhat struck me as the greatest technical achievement was the cinematography. Like the German film 'M', which was made ten years earlier, it has certain uses of the camera which where almost never seen before. If one analyzes the cinematography in the opening scene, you will realize that this camerawork was not common for the time, but it is so inventive and original that it is undeniable that it is ingenious, for example, the use of deep focus and, in the beginning, a fish-eye view though broken glass.\n\nOrson Welles plays Charles Foster Kane in an amazing way. In general, all the performances given are great, because of other talented actors such as Joseph Cotten, who was to later play in other movies like 'Shadow of a Doubt', 'The Third Man', which also has Orson Welles in it, and 'Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte'. Even though Joseph Cotten is excellent in this, Orson Welles truly was at his best, even though he was only 25 when he made this film! If you are a film buff, than you must see this, because of its technical accomplishments. For an 80 year-old film, it has not aged a day. Why is this movie an essential in film school? A few reasons are its lighting, cinematography, and character development. This is a must-see for any fan of drama and mystery movies, for any film buff, and any fan of movies.

Kane was based largely but not completely on William Randolph Hearst, the almost impossibly wealthy heir to the largest gold and silver mine owner in America, who became a powerful publishing magnate.

Yes, I had viewed many YouTube videos about Citizen Kane before ever watching the film, but that didn't take away from the enjoyment; I had actually completely forgotten what \"Rosebud\" meant anyway. Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) is on his deathbed in the palatial Xanadu when he murmurs \"Rosebud\" before expiring. Discovering what this American Titan's last word actually meant propels the film, if only superficially. Welles — who is also the (25 year old!) director — lays it all out in a news-breaking montage of Kane's life, the peaks and valleys, before seeing him as a child playing in the snow. We pretty much know everything that happens 15 minutes-in, now we get to fill in the gaps. Kane is ahead of his time as the newspaper mogul (think Ted Turner, Rupert Murdoch today) who, on day one of taking over The Inquirer, states: \"News is 24 hours\". Thus, changing the way the city — and eventually, the nation — learned about the world, especially considering he filled those pages with the filth we gobble up like a smorgasbord today. Considered a communist to some, a fascist to others (how topical), Kane engages in many of the activities you'd expect a super-wealthy businessman to engage in — expands his empire, ends friendships, ends marriages, begins new marriages, and builds a palace down in Florida with the biggest fuck-off fireplace I've ever seen. Considered a composite character, your opinion on Kane is probably justified and misguided.. That's to say, he's neither hero nor villain. Although Welles didn't necessarily invent many of the shots in his film, he absolutely changed the director's efficacy in storytelling, with too many to count here. A few include: the shot of Kane's parents (Agnes Morehead & Harry Shannon) with the banker (George Coulouris) who becomes his legal guardian as young Kane (Buddy Swan) is playing in the snow, Kane giving a political speech — the most recognizable scene of the film — with a gigantic poster of himself in the background, and the final shot of all the crates housing his treasures. \"One word can't explain a man's life.\" Our powerful departing words. Oh, and what is \"Rosebud\"? Eh, watch the film to find out. If anything, to pay homage to that gif you probably (sarcastically) use all the time.",

Completely kept in the shadows! It's absolutely gorgeous.. The cinematography and lighting hold this film together for me. Its sets and costumes are pretty damn magnificent as well. It's an epic in many ways. \n\nI appreciate the early, even in the 1940s, reminder that success does not mean happiness. Not saying it's the greatest story to tell this lesson, but I appreciate its place in time and attempt. Once again, I'm taken by the performances, visuals and overall appreciate it for its filmmaking craft. \n\nOrson Welles has been a favorite ever since I saw him \"The Third Man\" (1939) as well as Joseph Cotten. It reminds me a lot of \"The Great Gatsby\" and \"The Aviator\" (2004) story. I always love seeing the rise and downfall of a powerful entity!\n\nThere are so many images in this film that will never leave my mind! It's a classic in my heart and has influenced so many films that I love and adore! Hope new generations can still find the beauty in an old relic like \"Citizen Kane\" (1941).",

Fellow Tomato reviewers below me will honestly start their movie reviews here and spout some BS and use some big words to make them sound like they might have an idea what they're talking about. A good example of this is \"The sheer brilliance\" or maybe \"Such vast difference...\" is littered with every review below mine. And this ladies and gentleman is exactly what Citizen Kane strived to achieve. Sheep blindly following the status quo are lead to believe that their voice matters. They pretend to understand why this movie is too great, yet fall very short of the real reason. \n\nAllow me to explain myself. The Spanish American War took place from 1898 to 1898. That's right not even a single year, but that's not important. Whats what is really important is what happened in 1901 3 years later in his final moments the key is revealed to all of us from the lips of Leon Czolgosz, who assassinated President William McKinley. \n\n\"I killed the President because he was the enemy of the good people—the good working people.

Citizen cane according to the product description was wishing for \"traditional aphrodisiacal Ingredients\". \n\nInconclition Citizen Kane was a lewd man that wanted nothing more than to cure his ED.

While the cinematography is fantastic with its deep shots and angles that tell a story all on their own. It is the character of the titular character that sours the movie for me. I found myself rooting for almost everyone who opposed him because I found him despicable. Kane was a power hungry man who's misogyny could be chalked up to the times but his constant disregard for the women he is supposed to spend the rest of his life with is disappointing. It was said very well in the film that he wanted someone to love him, the character himself seemed incapable of love, probably due to his childhood trauma. Normally when someone experiences childhood trauma in movies I find myself at least somewhat sympathetic towards their emotional struggles later in life, not so with Kane. Kane was a character I grew to hate alongside his wives. The fact that the whole movie is about trying to figure out his dying words as if \"Rosebud\" was a secret code word that would help one to rule the world or perhaps even the stock market felt like a joke. There are some debates in the real world whether \"Rosebud\" was literal for his sled or if it was supposed to represent his lost childhood and innocence, or even a thousand different other things it could possibly mean if it wasn't just literally about his beloved sled he was forced to leave behind but somehow got magically transported to his massive storage room of expensive collectibles and junk. The debate around the word echos the search for the meaning in the film when I think for a man who was superficial as Kane was tend to think of it being literally about just the sled. He as an old and most likely senile man, which with great age comes lack of sense or great capacity of mental faculties. The last words of a fragile old man can hardly be taken as seriously in the movie or the world outside it. Most elderly when they pass if they say some nonsense words it just gets chalked up to their brains being addled with barely much further thoughts into their meaning. I felt an overwhelming sense of relief once the film concluded and I no longer had to watch the pointless pursuit of the meaning of \"rosebud\" or the endeavors of a selfish man with no regards for anyone but himself. The amount of care that went into his last words the man who spoke them wouldn't have given a fraction of to anyone else. I am not a person who enjoys movies about unsavory characters and like to have a main character to root for. When it feels as there isn't a single person to root for in a film, watching it just feels like a chore or I could even go so far as to say insufferable.",

I didn't follow a strict order and tried to catch films in theaters (pre covid) any chance I found, but my only rule was that I couldn't watch #1 until I had completed the entire list ahead of it.\n\nThe \"best ever\" is always going to be hard to live up to in a medium as subjective as film so I was pleasantly impressed that this, while not my #1, was a worthy holder of the crown. The structure of the plot alone had to be quite ahead of it's time and worked so well for the type of investigative look into the entirety of a life, that this film takes us on. I loved the cavernous sets of the Kane mansion which displayed the eye piercing beauty of opulence and wealth, trophies of his conquest over every one of his fellow men, but also fully exhibited and gave the audience a nudge to feel, the immense sense of loneliness a singular pursuit, allowing you to love no one but yourself, can bring about in a person. Welles' acting was superb and the writing was pleasingly sharp as well, which along with the important universal themes being explored through a unique presentation, make it easy to understand why this film is so well respected. 8.5/10",

Welles utilized groundbreaking cinematic techniques that were considered ahead of their time. Using captivating cinematography, Welles draws viewers into the world of a selfish business tycoon. From intimate close-ups to evocative establishing shots, the cinematography keeps viewers immersed in the film's setting. The sets, costumes and musical score are all carefully chosen, combining to create an immersive cinematic experience. Welles' screenplay is also sensational, and expertly uses non-linear storytelling to keep viewers absorbed in the mystery surrounding Kane's death. It is hard to not admire the iconic performances from the cast. Orson Welles delivers one of the best performances of his career Charles Foster Kane. With mesmerizing expressions, he conveys the ambition, torment and selfish persona of the titular business tycoon. The supporting cast, which includes the scene-stealing Joseph Cotten, is also excellent and worthy of recognition. When discussing \"Citizen Kane\", it is hard to not mention the musical score. Bernard Hermann's classical score is highly effective. It builds palpable tension and suspense. With the exception of its outdated ten-minute expository opening sequence, \"Citizen Kane\" remains a timeless classic nearly 80 years after its release. A must-see for movie-lovers, it set the stage for influential cinematic techniques that continue to be used in the film industry today.

The clunkiness of the acting on show from some of the supporting cast members only serves to highlight the brilliance of Orson Welles, whose ease and watchability are way ahead of his time. Likewise, even the cardboard backdrops don't spoil what is a fantastic plot: the story of a man who, had he not been rich might just have been great, and the message that absolute power corrupts even the seemingly incorruptible. The dialogue is witty and pulls the tale along by the scruff of the neck. A really memorable montage shows the descent of Kane's moral rectitude along with his marriage over a succession of increasingly stagnant breakfasts. And when we finally learn the meaning of \"Rosebud\", Kane's enigmatic dying word, it is wonderfully poignant, revealing the protagonist's lasting fondness for the memories of his youth and the potential, long since wasted, that youthfulness once represented. All that being said, Citizen Kane is undoubtedly of-its-time, and as such requires investment from its audience, who must be willing to suspend their expectation of 21s century slick. It drags in parts, and some of the lesser cast members are more wooden than the backdrop on which the jaw-dropping mountain retreat of Xanadu is painted. But if, in the pursuit of seeing how the pioneers paved the way for the likes of actor/directors like Eastwood and Howard you are willing to overlook such things, you will certainly enjoy - and genuinely enjoy - this film.",

The film was made in the year 1941, which is amazing. \"Sergeant York\" was made in the same year and it received an Oscar for the best actor in a leading role, although it should have definitely went to this film, as well as that, compared to \"Sergeant York\" \"Citizen Kane\" is much more realistic. The movie is revolutionary as you can see how incredibly serious it is for it's time and how well the plot is structured. Amazing decorations also make it for a feeling of being an incredible film,  as well as it has awesome music. It is a must watch for anyone who enjoys cinema, but I wouldn't say I'd recommend it for a regular viewer, so it is an 8.5/10, if you are a regular viewer, try watching it for the sake of how well it's written for its time.",

What he uncovers is a picture of a frustratingly complex character where no one really knows the whole truth.\nAn eminently watchable and entertaining movie, Citizen Kane is firmly of its era and shows Welles to be a bright, fun-loving and innovative filmmaker and makes for a charismatic leading actor. He excelled in surrounding himself with a host of real professionals who became stalwarts of the industry both infant of and behind the camera. This movie is no exception and it really is a masterclass in how to make a darned good movie in every respect.",

            "content": "TODAY IS THE 80TH ANNIVERSARY OF CITIZEN KANE, \nONE OF MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE MOVIES!\n\n===\n\n\"Rosebud.\"\n\nThis one word is the catalyst for the events that follow it, as reporters scramble to find out its meaning, only to find out in the end that it means nothing. Citizen Kane is a film built on such paradoxes; just like the titular character, Charles Foster Kane. The narrative is scrambled, told primarily through flashbacks, and tells us everything that will happen in the first 15 minutes; or so it seems. The film is an enigma. Just like Charles, the film keeps us just outside, providing hints that might help us understand it a little more, but in the end, we end up even more perplexed. \n\nThe cinematography was light years ahead of its time; in the newest 4K remasters, it's impossible to tell that the film is 80 years old. Gregg Toland, the director of photography, was already well-known by this point in his career, but it was his contributions to Citizen Kane that elevated him to legend status. Toland and Welles took everything they knew about the medium, and everything they didn't, and threw it at the screen with full confidence. The result was a style that redefined cinema; a strange mixture that called upon German expressionist lighting, Soviet-style montage, experimental sound design Welles picked up working in radio, and silent-era shot compositions, all with a distinct golden-age Hollywood flair.\n\nToland famously used deep focus to great effect, throwing out conventional framing, and instead relying on complex frame compositions to draw the audience's attention. The pair were relentless in their pursuit to find the perfect look, doing some very bizarre things to arrive at the right angle. They famously ripped holes in the floor to get the low angle they desired, and then had to create special microphones and ceilings made of canvas to be able to capture audio; all for a shot that lasted less than 60 seconds. They sliced tables in half, put them back together again, craned the camera up past the ceiling into the rafters, employed bizarre camera movements, expressive uses of the z-axis, and moody, exaggerated lighting, all of which paid off; the cinematography is still studied in film schools today.\n\nIt's a miracle that the film was even released; William Randolph Heart, whom the film was loosely based on, desperately attempted to stop the release of the film. The writer, Herman Mankiewicz, was a cynical drunkard that had been cast out of Hollywood. The cinematographer, Gregg Toland, was a crazy innovator obsessed with film experimentation. The director, Orson Welles, despite having prior experience in theater, had never used a camera in his life.\n\nHowever, the end result was nothing short of a masterpiece; a movie every bit as fragmented and broken as its titular character.\n\nCharles Kane is a very obviously conflicted man, the non-linear sequencing of the film only serves to amplify that fact. The use of flashbacks is masterful, and it would take days to properly put the scenes in order. As the reporters interview Kane's alcoholic mistress, his ailing old friend, his rich associate, and other witnesses, memories are twisted and distorted as the story loops through time. We learn all about his childhood, his lovers, his friends, his enemies, his rise to power, and his fall from it. \n\nThroughout his life, Kane wants everything, anything, to fill the void left in his heart as a child, when he was torn away from his parents and his precious sled, named ‘Rosebud.' He tries idealism, politics, romance, before eventually spending his fortune filling a castle with worthless statues, dying an empty man. ‘Rosebud' is more than just a sled; it represented Charles' poor attempts to regain his childhood innocence and his pursuit for love, things many men spend their entire lives trying to attain. \n\n\"All he really wanted out of life was love.\nThat's the tragedy of Charles Foster Kane.\nYou see, he just didn't have any to give.\"\n\nHowever, Citizen Kane knows that ‘Rosebud' isn't simply an object. It tells us what it is, but not what it means. The film is a very strange meditation on death, one that is simultaneously terrifying and strangely tranquilizing at the same time. Memories are the main vehicle of the movie, and that is how we see Kane, and that is how others will see us after we pass. As we watch the different perspectives, Kane almost seems like a completely different man in every vignette: there is the Kane who was torn from his precious sled as a child, the Kane that ran for president, the Kane who built on opera for his lover, the Kane who bought a castle and filled it with worthless sculptures, the Kane that mentally tortured his wife, the Kane who died alone.\n\n\"I don't think any word can explain a man's life. \nNo, I guess Rosebud is just a piece in a jigsaw puzzle. \nA missing piece.\"\n\n===\n\nCITIZEN KANE - ORSON WELLES / 1941 / FILM NOIR, EXPERIMENTAL,\nGOTHIC DRAMA, MYSTERY, HISTORICAL EPIC, BLACK & WHITE\n\n10/10\nRichard B.

Где без сантиментов, нравоучительства и излишнего пафоса показаны очень коротко его ранние годы, заключённое именно на столь дорогом ему сердцу предмету. Вещь, олицетворяющую собой, то счастье, которое было так лучезарно в его детстве, возвращая его лучшие воспоминания. Плоть до самой смерти, последнее, что он вспоминает – это ту вещь, символ, выражающий суть данного повествования. Также как зацикливание, заострение на последних словах человека перед смертью. Время от времени показывается воспоминание, как расследование, связанное с юностью мальчика. И то, что стало для него единственным утешением, другом и намного большим, чем простое общение. Эта связь с таким же непорочным и дорогим, может приобретать различные формы, но суть и ценность этого неизмерима. Последний эпизод фильма, всё полностью раскрывает и подготовленного зрителя от понимания пробивает током воздействия мысли.\nШарик с домиком, как у него в детстве и вечной зимой, зимой в душе, зимой в сердце. И лишь та ностальгия его раннего детства может уже согреть его сущность.\n\nПовествование мысли.\nДостаток человека, уже зашкаливает от всевозможных ценностей мира. Удовольствия, дворцы и замки, построен искусственный город в самом большом размахе и роскоши. Это всё для мистера Кейна, такого важного и почётного гражданина. Были собраны и привезены все лучшие статуи и произведения искусства. Золото и серебро. Богатства столько, что можно обставить десять всемирных музеев. Животные и птицы, каждой твари по паре, делают его зоопарк самым роскошным, а по аллеям и паркам ходят павлины, вьёт гнёзда фазаны, и поют свои трели соловьи.\nПоказывая это в своём изложении, настраиваю читателя сначала на картинку, потом на мысль. Как в Библии о царе Соломоне, мудрый Экклезиаст говорит, что это той радости и счастья не принесёт. Всё тленно, из праха и в землю уйдёт. Есть ценности непреходящие, не связанные с материальным миром и руками человека. Сокровища, которые не горят, так как находятся в сердце самом. Оставляющие след в душе намного больший, чем различные драгоценные камни и статуи. Идут по фильму завуалированные и многочисленные сноски на Святое писание. Уже откровенно упоминая Ноев ковчег и мавзолей с заготовленными мраморными глыбами для собственной гробницы в лучших традициях царей и фараонов.\n\nРазмышление о фильме.\nС цинизмом и едкой шуткой показана дальнейшая середина фильма. Под лозунгом –«Убейте меня, пока я счастлив». Самодовольная ирония идёт в ногу с трудными перипетиями жизни, оставляя след с налётом лёгкости.\nРодившейся и росший в нищете гражданин, пробивает себе дорогу на самый «верх». Во владениях Кейна, по сути, оказался весь окружающий его мир, ставя его одним из самых богатых людей в мире. Чутьё и присущая хватка является той необходимой частью жизни, которая добивается успеха. Кардинальные изменения на примере редакции газеты, показывают свежий взгляд и новый подход действий, выведение из затянувшегося «болота». Изменения устава и правил влечёт за собой то нужное стремление и перспективы, которые так необходимы для дальнейшего продвижения. А преданность политической мишуре выявляет ту продажность, чьи мотивы идут в разрез любой идеи. Со своим смыслом улавливается кузница кадров и её предназначение, в становлении потом президентами и верховными вождями в других странах. Но, при нужном управлении, режиме контроля, «дёргая за ниточки».\nМногогранность повествования показывает политическую игру. Не давая обещаний, их ненужно будет сдерживать. Человек верит только в себя и в свои силы. И переступая чрез преграды, а порой их и вовсе не замечая, идёт гражданин Кейн по карьерной лестнице, показательно воплощая американскую мечту.\n\nПринципы, которые показаны в фильме с одной стороны есть кабала, с другой утверждённая поступь, закон, союз и договорённость, которая и утверждает характер человека.\nРазличные \"наклёпы\" и наговоры показаны в высмеивании общества. Манипуляция на различных постах. Мораль и устои всегда правили и остаются править этим миром. Давая любому гражданину, как взлёты, так и падения. Чтобы выше быть склок и недомолвок, гражданин берёт эту критику на себя, как бы подыгрывая и доделывая этот пасквиль, как хотел бы видеть это другой гражданин. Выставляя его стремление в очернении и грязи на суд читателям основной газеты.\nЛюбовь и ненависть народа, исполнение и прихоти, управление властью читается сквозь кадр. Желание любви всесторонне и многолико в стремлении всё большего насыщения общества и гражданина. Политическая идеология в действии и управление словом может вершить судьбы мира. Есть люди коллекционирующие что либо. А есть во множественном числе «гражданин Кейн» коллекционирующий этих людей. «Покупка» одного человека другим является показателем и мерилом гражданина, всё больше находящимся в данном обществе.\n\nВ фильме показана любовь не как высшее чувство, спасительная миссия или жертвенная проза бытия …, любовь показана эгоистичная, ненасытная, разрушающая своей силой и навязчивостью в противовес всем библейским законам. Преследуя свои корыстные планы и желания, гражданин Кейн оперирует даже ей. Говоря сквозь фильм, что единственно правильная любовь для каждого гражданина – это любовь его собственная.\nДля публичного человека нет ничего хуже, когда публика, народ не понимает его. Чем больше человек общается в обществе и шумной суете многих, тем больше он испытывает одиночество. Ведь нелюдимый, одинокий человек счастлив этим по своей природе, он не испытывает ту потребность в тишине и молчании, которая так нужна всем остальным людям. Одинокий человек живёт своим одиночеством, а известный на обществе гражданин Кейн, всё чаще испытывает эту нужду. Отправляясь на поиски своей юности, ища там умиротворенности и ушедшего счастья.\n\nПрофессиональная часть.\nФильм состоит из довольно быстрых тематических эпизодов, как калейдоскоп перетекающих в логическое продолжение. Выставляя цепочку мышления как в интенсивном расследовании, состоящую из фактов и нарезки флэшбэков в показательном виде. Мастерские съёмки и видеоряд, через оптическую призму. Невзирая на великолепную игру актёров, новшества в монтаже кадра, этот фильм за смысл и высказанную человеческую сущность, долгие десятилетия являлся лучшим во всех списках киноакадемий. Значение данного фильма во всём мире очень высоко. Разбирать анализами критики великий фильм, который, до этих пор занимал первые места – смешно, нелепо и рука не подымется. Скажу лишь, что фильм – полностью Орсона Уэллса, в котором он выступил как главный герой, а также сценарист, режиссёр и продюсер. Рассказывает о жизни медиамагната, который и был основателем всей жёлтой прессы. При жизни полной власти, этот магнат, начал настоящую «войну» против режиссёра. И столь вымученный фильм появился намного позже, чем ожидалось. Выявляя свободу и ценность происходящего.\n\nПсихология фильма.\nПоказана грань насыщения и обладания, с годами уходящая чувственность отношений, с которой идут сначала рука об руку. Далее, преобладание эмоций, потом возвышенные чувства, переживания, понимание, в конце - молчание и самодостаточность. В итоге, выливающеюся пустоту совместного проживания. Он и она живут, почти не замечая друг друга. Замкнутость и пустота являет то нечто, которое витает уже в других мирах.\nЛюбой человек хорошее очень быстро забывает, а что-то его не устраивавшее, помнит очень долго. Люди помнят такое, о чём все остальные даже не подозревают. Показана также душевная составляющая красоты, увиденная на короткое время и больше не принадлежащая тебе, но не отпускающая и преследующая тебя всю жизнь.\nБогатство ли влияет на величие человека. Если человек не был бы так беден или так богат, он стал бы по-настоящему великим. И в сущности своей человек, как и гражданин Кейн закрыт от окружающих. И открыться и сказать свою истину тяжело, другим непонятно, и многим не под силу. Воспоминания того, что ты сам потерял по жизни, ещё одно неувядающее присутствие, той любимой грусти, которое бывает таким важным.\n\nЗаключение.\nПростая, старая вещь, которую можно было купить за бедные гроши, как воспоминание и ностальгия по тому беззаботному и счастливому времени, даёт то необходимое состояние, которое ценится выше всех благ на свете.\nЖизнь человека трудно объяснить словами, как и загадку по фильму «Розового бутона». Также как трудно уместить в коротком метраже 70 лет человеческой жизни.\nПослесловие.\n«Кто никогда не совершал безрассудств, тот не так мудр, как ему кажется» - Ларошфуко.",

We owe so much to this film and it's influence but it's a testament to it's greatness that it can be loved as well as admired without losing any of it's sharpness or intelligence. This was the best film of 1941 and one of the greatest of all time, I would still call Gone With the Wind (1939) the best but I was overjoyed to see in it what everybody else sees.\n\nMedia tycoon Charles Foster Kane, Orson Welles, is hugely powerful and influential in the late 1920s in New York City. He dips his toe into politics in the hope of becoming governor but his relationship with the President's niece, Emily Monroe Norton Kane, Ruth Warrick, begins to deteriorate as he has an affair with young singer Susan Alexander, Dorothy Comingore. When the affair is revealed his political ambitions are derailed but he forces his new wife to perform and prove her greatness to her detractors bringing embarrassment to her and isolating him from his critic friend Jedediah Leland, Joseph Cotten. His self destructive nature eventually consumes him as he occupies his time with buying sculptures and those he cares about leave him but after his death a reporter sets out on a mission to investigate his final word, \"Rosebud.\"\n\nThe story is able to bring together so many different elements as it works as a critique of yellow journalism and it's influence on politics and as a sad tragedy about a man with greatness in him being brought down by childhood trauma. At just under two hours it is impressive how much time we feel we spend on each plot point, it never feels as though we are rushing through this man's life as each scene seems deliberate in it's use and all of them flow naturally into one another. I felt depressed at the end of the film because despite finding many flaws in Kane's character I was concerned about him and felt saddened at the sight of everyone around him, initially in his thrall, moving away from him slowly and coming to resent him in some cases. Welles, a mad genius himself, must have known in some ways what it was like to be Kane and he leaves us profoundly effected by the shocking final scene in this film.\n\nThe film gave cinema innumerable innovations as it uses then uncommon low angle shots, deep focus, the non-chronological timeline and the omniscient perspective that it uses to great effect. These innovations are a big part of why the film is so respected and influential but yet again it never makes the film feel inaccessible. I know very little about film production and what goes into the technical aspects of a film but I was awed by the sight of Welles standing in front of a giant poster reading ‘Kane' with an image of his face upon it and every spotlight in the world hitting him. Throughout I saw so many images that I had seen before so many times due to their iconography but seeing them all together within a compelling narrative made them even more impactful and I sat back and realized that I was watching some undeniable cinematic greatness even with the skepticism that I so often bring into film watching.\n\nWhen talking about this film you have to talk about the man behind the magic, lead actor, director, co-writer and producer Orson Welles. His presence on screen is so great that it is at times easy to be overwhelmed by him but really only he could have played this role as he is at once charismatic and impossible to look away from and a fragile mess. We feel for him even as we realize he is superior to most of humanity and we would never reach his level of brilliance or bravado but somehow we care that this boy lost his childhood and never recovered from it.",

In a sense, Wells' life and career are not so different from Kane's; he too lost his parents at an early age, and he, too, was the victim of the corrupt power struggles of the world of journalism and politics in America. Because of the political and economic attack of the millionaire Hearst on \"Citizen Kane,\" Wells' career (1915-1985) did not take off as it should have.

It's convenient to blame William Randolph Hearst for its failure at the box office, but had the movie been any good, nothing could have stopped the general public from its doors.  Eighty years later, the film has only grown more juvenile -- as would be expected by a troupe touting its first film.  The critical response to the movie is not understandable.

I'm not sure I can add anything novel to the film's glowing critical esteem, but having finally seen it again, I can at least re-affirm my ardent and unwavering admiration for it.\n\nThe mesmeric opening sequence alone blows you away, not just for its cinematographic virtuosity (more of that in a moment), but with its sheer gusto and masterful scale of storytelling. Any film that opens on a series of dissolves has my attention (I based the opening few pages of my Eivissa on this technique, so it's nice to know I've received inadvertent affirmation of that sensibility from the great Orson Welles!) The sentimental snow-glass being dropped portentously, the strange perspectives refracted through the snow-glass, then the immortal dying utterance of \"Rosebud\" - these all brilliantly set up the film's thesis probing the genesis of Charles Foster Kane. Then this opening, extrovert flourish is immediately counteracted by an antithetical, matter-of-fact news report introducing the figure of Kane in a more 'conventional' way.\n\nIt's probably boring to non-cinephiles the amount of swooning commentators do over Welles' command of the medium, but it really is immense, with every second of every frame revealing some kernel of information or emotion through an element of framing, perspective, sound design or storytelling. Most scenes in the film are immemorial, but the melancholic tracking shot to Susan's washed-up Atlantic City show by use of a magical faded cut crystallises the bittersweet end-destination of Kane's failed experiment (his second wife), and the imposing, echoing sound design in Xanadu is amazing - emphasising the de facto mausoleum Kane has built for himself.",

            "content": "In this film we see the arc of a wealthy man's life from childhood memories to his aspirations after college, from wielding power in the middle of life to an end that, amidst vast wealth and opulence, simply looks back on childhood, and then goes up in smoke.   Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) may have been based on William Randolph Hearst and the film a critique of the 'rich and powerful', but there are elements it that are also universal.  It takes a piercing look into how people change over time, how power corrupts, and how all life is transient.  \n\nKane may have all of the benefits that money brings, but he's also a little broken inside, with perhaps a narcissistic or attachment disorder stemming from having been given up for adoption by his own biological parents when he was a boy (and that, in turn, hinted as being due to his father's abuse).  He therefore has no real friends, or true love.  He positions himself as a 'man of the people', but he's aloof and above them from all, using them to amplify his own power.  He may collect all of the statues he can find in Europe for his castle in America, but ultimately dies like anyone else, without any real meaning, and his possessions disbursed.  \n\nIt's fascinating to watch Kane evolve over the film.  His days as a young man are full of hubris and the desire to run a newspaper, mainly to push social messages.  While he also has a knack for increasing circulation via sensationalism, he's also pure enough to pen a 'Declaration of Principles' that promises to publish truth, free of special interests.  In a fantastic exchange, his friend Jedediah (Joseph Cotten) points out that his first two sentences have started with the word \"I\", and as we'll see, the 'special interest group' that Kane sells out to is Kane himself.  He gradually morphs to begin abusing the power he has as a publisher, swaying opinions on war, and flat out saying that the people will think what he tells them to think.\n\nKane's relationships also evolve in interesting ways.  Early on he seems so close with Jedediah, jovial and dancing at office parties, but he fires him without thinking twice about it when Jedediah dares to publish the truth in a review of his second wife's awful performance at the opera.  In a parallel way, we see this second wife (Dorothy Comingore) go from a humble, nice, and honest woman he meets on the street one night to a spoiled and vindictive wife, then bitter alcoholic.  She speaks about Kane over a drink in a two-bit club, and Jedediah speaks about him from an assisted living facility.  The film has a rather dark view of the endgame that awaits us all.\n\nThe transience of life is further emphasized by little moments in the supporting cast, such as Bernstein (Everett Sloane) saying of his own life these fantastic lines: \"A fellow will remember a lot of things you wouldn't think he'd remember. You take me. One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on the ferry, and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in, and on it there was a girl waiting to get off. A white dress she had on. She was carrying a white parasol. I only saw her for one second. She didn't see me at all, but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl.\"\n\nOrson Welles is excellent as both actor and director, and the way the story is told, via flashbacks from multiple perspectives and short jumps in time, is compelling.  He also utilizes a number of innovative and interesting visual techniques that feel modern.  If you're looking for a film with an uplifting message, one with action, or one that will leave you feeling warm, this is not your film.  On the other hand, there is such honesty here about power and about life, the filmmaking is fantastic, and it has an ending that is absolutely devastating, in those plumes of smoke going up into the night sky.",

Someone could trace Citizen Kane's greatness in its legacy and massive influence on every single film it influenced afterwards. I believe that Citizen Kane is the greatest film ever directed. For it is Orson Welles' fine attention to detail, meticulous storytelling, and his utmost care in the crafting of his art that makes Citizen Kane so notable.\n\nHe chose very specific sequences, shots, and scenes to hopefully get the audience to understand that man that was Charles Foster Kane. The film starts with a news reel that tells Kane's entire life. We learn the \"whens\" and \"whats\" of his life.\n\nThen we follow a journalist hoping to uncover the significance and meaning to Kane's last word: \"Rosebud.\" In this journey, he interviews Kane's \"whos\": his adopted father, his banker, his best friend, his second wife, and finally his butler. Herein, we find out the \"hows\" of Kane's life. The intimate details of his mortal coil as Kane's closest citizens experienced them.\n\nLastly, upon the great reveal of the biggest twist ending in film history, you understand the \"why\" in Kane's life. Why did Charles Foster Kane do what he did. Why buy things instead of investing, why love who he loved, and in the way he loved. It all makes sense and Welles plotted it all out for you.\n\nFor Orson Welles, Kane is just a man that he may explain as a film character. It's all there for you to find out and enjoy as you will for yourself.\n\nFilms are unique in the world of art as they are a visual medium for an auteur director to reveal something to the audience. We see what we want to see as well as what the director intends for us to see in their work.\n\nOrson Welles' debut film Citizen Kane is a clear example of a masterful director focusing the audience's view on particular shots, subjects, themes, characters, developments, reveals all through cinematography, editing, and the unique angling of the lens. Welles accomplishes so very much in this movie.\n\nThe acting is excellent throughout from all actors and actresses. You believe everyone. The old age makeup and the makeup to make them appear weary and worn is so authentic. The sets are grand, Bernard Herrmann's score is intense and magnificent like the man that is Charles Foster Kane.\n\nHowever, these are all merely clockwork to the final machination of Citizen Kane as a film. All of these aspects are supervised lovingly and hand crafted by Orson Welles. I think Welles truly made a masterpiece of film. For all its individual parts are remarkable, but what endures about Citizen Kane is how Welles speaks to humanity's greatest theme and motivation: love. It is this simple beautiful thing that we function for, with, and towards evermore.",

            "content": "Finally, I got to watch Citizen Kane, and there is no confusion about why this is commonly considered one of the greatest films of all-time. I watched many movies that have been described as \"Revolutionary\"  and \"Game-changing\". But besides that Citizen Kane really deserve to be called so more than any movie I've watched in my life, it's could be the oldest movie that is as influential as it is timeless. I felt I was watching a movie the has been released couple years ago, except it's shot in black and white. An ecstasy of light and shadow, of clashing textures and graphic forms. A haunting cinematography that makes Citizen Kane one of the best-looking movies to date. an exuberant use of camera placement and movement and inventive lighting. Yes, it's above all a visual achievement. But all these innovative techniques shouldn't be questioned whether they still hold up or not. Because they don't just hold up to this day, but they are as fresh and contemporary as they were in 1941. But all that is from the technical standpoint, so what about the screenplay, the narrative, the story?\n\nAs Orson Welles took many risks directing Citizen Kane he also took risks writing it's Oscar-winning script with Herman J. Mankiewicz. And of course by risks I mean the unprecedented use of flashbacks, and the non-linear storytelling. And While I can't say this way of storytelling paid off perfectly, I have to admit that this structure has changes the game forever in film-making. It took me a while to be engaged with the characters, and the story itself. That's because the pacing was confusingly fast at the beginning, and some important aspects and details in the story needed to be more focused on. \n\nIt also dragged, and almost lost me a couple of times. As I mentioned above, the build up for the titular character could've been way better, at least to make me invested in the character from the start.\n\nWith that being said, the more the time goes, the more I became engaged with the story, and invested in all the characters, not only Charles Kane. And I couldn't help but hope for some explanation about the fate of Kane. \n\nAfter some more minutes, I realized that Citizen Kane is a character study, actually, a very complex and compelling one. The story became more poignant and moving. By the way, if you still haven't watched Citizen Kane because you think it's a pretty serious and bleak film, you better watch it ASAP. Because it's actually funny! Yes, sometimes it's funny in a cynical way, but it is always a light-hearted movie, and easy to watch. But that doesn't mean it's a feel-good movie at all. As I mentioned, it the story becomes more touching and emotional as it proceeds, and it's represented in a flashback structure to reveal some mysteries about a publishing tycoon's rise and fall who dies corrupt and alone. So I think you get the point.\n\nAll the performances are impeccable, and Orson Welles' performance is as terrific as his direction. Also, Joseph Cotten is great as always. \nAlso, the dialogue is so clever, and there are a fair share of very subtle lines.\n\nCitizen Kane is far from perfect, IMO. Nevertheless, it somehow lives up to its reputation as a landmark achievement in film. But what's striking now is how utterly modern it is in direction. \n\n(8/10)",

Citizen Kane is vague, with incoherent plot and morals. In addition to that it is severely lacking in joy and thrill. It starts out as a mystery movie, yet the ending is totally unsatisfying and too metaphorical, leading me to believe the real mystery is why it is such a critically-acclaimed movie. It is touted every decade by critics as the best film of all time.

To my understanding, Orson Welles and Gregg Toland could barely be seen as innovators in regards to the various cinematographic techniques used; the thing which made \"Citizen Kane\" stand out among its predecessors, was rather the combination of many existing ones, combined with an achronological narrating style. Even so, it does not fulfill its contemporary premise.\n\nThe film, in its whole basically mixing some sensationalised mystery with a description of newspaper magnate William Hearst's ever-deprecating life (portrayed by none other than Orson Welles himself, a performance which certainly is commendable, in all), is able to deliver good dialogue, with some exceptions wherein the conversations feel forced and too theatricised. Editing is also good, but really nothing to write home about, as this too sometimes leaves (much) to be desired. (And that is without mentioning the consequential and terrible attempts at making fourth wall breaks seem fashionable.)\nThe so-called \"pan-focus\" (i.e. the focusing on multiple layers of depth in one shot) seems peculiar the first time it's used, but Welles and Toland milk this kind of camerawork so much that it quickly becomes a - surprisingly annoying - gimmick.\nIronically, the story is built around a single word, \"Rosebud\", whispered by Kane in his last breath seconds before dying, and the journalistic research thereafter trying to figure out the meaning of said word. Seeing as to how this is the premise of the whole movie, it forms a gigantic plot hole from the very start and at the very base of it; after all, given that not a single person is within hearing range to perceive Kane's dying word and subsequently get the word out about it, the plot driving the movie just doesn't make sense.\n\nUltimately, where I land on this film, is that it really suffers from the status it's been given: frankly, placing a movie on a pedestal arguing it to be \"the best movie ever made\" diminishes just such a status, and moreover makes it dilapidate into a category of lesser film. Why? Because of the extreme bias forced onto fresh audiences. Mind you, \"Citizen Kane\" was crafted very creatively, but in its essence, it's become nothing more than an idolisation and idealisation of its medium, causing nothing but letdown.\nI can see the glory which was once there, but also that it has faded just because of its presence. Quite sad, really.",

            "content": "Citizen Kane (1941) - O. Welles\n\nA flop at the time, Citizen Kane has now been acknowledged as one of the greatest movies of all time.  Orson Welles was a young wunderkind given carte blanche by RKO to make whatever movie he wanted and he brought his Mercury Players from New York (where they had triumphed on Broadway and on the radio, with help from the WPA).  Although the script included extensive contributions from Herman J. Mankiewicz (as documented by Pauline Kael but disputed by others) and the deep-focus cinematographic wizardry came courtesy of Gregg Toland, there is no doubting Welles' imprint as an auteur.  First, the theme of the egotistical power-hungry man who is also vulnerable, makes mistakes, and comes to a shoddy end appears more than once in his oeuvre (MacBeth, Mr. Arkadin, Touch of Evil), alongside the theme of nostalgia for days gone by, one's youth and innocence, before those mistakes were made (The Magnificent Ambersons, Chimes at Midnight, also Touch of Evil).  \"Rosebud\" represents this latter theme well.  Second, Welles' energy and enthusiasm devoted to the style of the picture are everywhere to be seen - in Kane we get thrilling montage after montage, beginning with the faux newsreel and extending to various ways that time is denoted as passing (those breakfast scenes with first wife Emily, the Opera sequences with second wife Susan).  The camerawork (with long tracking shots), the sets (with ceilings), the overlapping flashback structure, the ensemble acting (by Joseph Cotton, Everett Sloane, Dorothy Comingore, Ruth Warrick, Agnes Moorehead, Ray Collins, George Colouris, and of course, Welles himself in all sorts of makeup), the chiaroscuro lighting, the baroque excess of it all - these things make appearances in much of Welles' future work.  He never stopped experimenting (as witnessed by his late essay films F for Fake and Filming Othello) but it all started here.  Even seen many times, it is still astonishing to see just how creative the filmmaking was and how much freedom Welles was granted to do whatever he wanted (freedom he never had again).  The rise and fall of Charles Foster Kane, American, although perhaps a lightly veiled swipe at media tycoon William Randolph Hearst at the time, still has parallels to larger-than-life business/politicians today (yes, Donald J. Trump).  Some lessons are never learned.  Fortunately, Welles' own story was never conceived of as a tragic rise and fall by the man himself, who knew that artistic pleasures were to be gained through the process rather than necessarily in the end product alone.  However, with Kane, everything came together to produce an incredibly influential work of art that remains fresh 75 years later.",

Welles had no clue how to make movies. Fortunately for him, he watched (or in this case study) a western classic by John Ford entitled, Stagecoach (1939) 40 times.

I think there is a lot of great things going on in this script, and I see what they're trying to do, but I experienced a notable disconnect with the characters in the film. I acknowledge that they made a good choice introducing us to Kane as a young boy and showing how he developed into an aggressive but relatively noble young man. At this point I should be sympathizing with him, and have the same connection back to the innocence of his childhood that he had when he grew into a (seemingly) heartless tycoon. Yet for some reason I didn't make that connection, perhaps it was the short length of so many of the flashbacks which made it hard for me to relax and really get to know the characters. Naturally, since Citizen Kane is often considered one of the greatest movies of all time I feel compelled to defend my opinion simply because I'm not praising it on that level. However, there was so much that I thought was fabulous in the film. The composition of the shots was remarkable and clearly was planned out perfectly. The use of light and shadows was tremendous. The set design conveyed things to the audience without needing extra dialogue. There was so much that is right in this film that it seems a shame I instantly jump to the defensive and search for nitpicks. I wonder if, with more views I might embrace Citizen Kane even more. However, on my first watch I can see why it is so highly regarded but I can't lift it up to that height myself.",

After watching a lot of films, I especially loved conventional opening shots, Black & White film, drama and title card.\nThe plot is unique and the 'missing part' of the puzzle kept me waiting curiously till the climax. Kane's character is built slowly and with different perspectives. People who knew Kane shares their experience or moments spent with him which I think is the most powerful way to portray a person. This is similar to averaging grades or marks; The craving to know about \"Rosebud\"  takes us to a journey of Kane's life. Sequences are very well placed, Kane's second wife only opens up to Thomas in the second encounter, which adds a dimension to the film, not revealing the crucial part of Kane's life. A documentary about  Xanadu's empire feeds the viewers about the background, very well placed and in an innovative way. Kane's hobbies and ideology somehow creates curiosity, which is responsible for glued audiences. \nLighting in this film is very well made, it may be usage of natural light or arrangement, I just loved it. Some of the shots for instance, exterior to interior of the bar; so well made, it is definitely \"out of the box\" or special to me (during 1940's). Few scenes are morphed well (Present to the past) using windows or doors, etc. makes or creates an illusion of seamless shot (editing).\n[SPOILER ALERT]\nIn a canvas, it feels like Kane had a revenge on his foster father (May be); also many have interpreted \"Rosebud\" was his youth, happiness or freedom feels right to me too. At the moment of revealing \"Rosebud\" burning in a furnace, I related it to a mirror which would connect to me as, \"Kane could not get himself or lost himself\".",

Despite all of his TV appearances over the years, and films he acted in to fund his own productions, the first time I was aware of Orson Welles was one of those startling and bizarrely professional yet unmistakably charismatic 'Paul Masson' wine commercials that they tend to make fun of on The Simpsons in these decades gone by. My first thought was 'that voice is amazing', then 'he looks like he'd be a fine grandfather or Santa Claus', and I instantly wanted to know who he was: Just the way he carried himself, I knew he must be both brilliant and someone who was really important.\n\nAs you can tell, I'm not going to unnecessarily repeat all the endless accolades this film has gotten over the years. If you're any type of film lover, you have either seen this or will eventually--unless you're hit by a bus tomorrow (Heaven forbid) or something else drastic. It's a hallmark of what is possible in cinema. I waited until I was 46 to see this, because of its stellar reputation. It's not my favourite Welles--either acting or directing, and not by a long shot in either regard--but I'm very glad that I finally saw it, and I'll probably revisit it every couple of years for the rest of my life. There's just something really special about it that's hardly ever seen any more--and I think of that just as wistfully as Charles Foster Kane did about his beloved 'Rosebud'. That a 25-year-old could be so gleefully and breathtakingly experimental and innovative, yet still endlessly entertain, is nothing short of miraculous.",

Considered one of the greatest, if not the greatest, films of all time, Citizen Kane, which also revolutionized film cinematography, told truth about life that love cannot be gained by money. Assuredly, the film's remarkable excellences in every respect attest the addition of my perfect score to the already sky-high positive reviews of critics and audiences.\n\nBased on the newspaper publishing tycoon William Randolph Hearst, who also is credited for triggering the Spanish-American war, Citizen Kane begins with Kane's final, dying, \"Rosebud.\" Inquisitively, a curious reporter by the name of Thompson hopes to solve the mystery around the word and its meaning by interrogating friends and family of Kane. During these interviews, Kane's life unfolds in flashbacks as we see him possessing, with high hopes, his rich guardian's failing newspaper, which he quickly expands into an empire of thirty-seven nationwide newspapers under his unique techniques. But he wanted more; he wanted to be loved by everyone, adored by everyone, a governor, a household name. He just could not be content with what he was; he had to be bigger.\n\nWithout doubt, Orson Welles, the director, producer and screenwriter, also masterfully played this unique Kane, the rajah of the American society. As it was openly frowned upon during the Golden Age of films, little negative content appears Citizen Kane. Even though the plot revolves fairly around adultery, it is only mentioned slightly in newspaper headlines and characters' monologues. Also, young viewers may find the film boring as the message is told in a style that might be above their level.\n\nWhat if I said that \"Rosebud\" was his childhood sled? I revealed absolutely nothing about this unique, troubled life, as Thompson mentioned at the near the end, \"Maybe Rosebud was something he couldn't get or lost. No, I don't think it explains anything. I don't think any word explains a man's life. No - I guess Rosebud is just a piece in a jigsaw puzzle - a missing piece.\" Kane, a man who wanted love on his own \"terms,\" failed to understand in his \"terms\" that in receiving love, love needs to be given. With this deep and powerful message, this piece of art has been ingrained into history as the most influential film ever, and it will easily become a family favorite.",

Admittedly, I recently saw the film for the first time. I feel like multiple viewings of the film are needed in order to properly digest and form my opinions, but I will attempt to review it nonetheless. \"Citizen Kane\" is directed by Orson Welles,who also stars in the film. The cast also includes Joseph Cotten, Dorothy Comingore Agnes Moorehead, and Everett Sloane.\n\nAfter the death of Charles Foster Kane (Welles), a team of reporters set out to find the meaning of Mr. Kane's final words. With nothing to go on but the word, Rosebud, the reporters interview Kane's acquaintances. Throughout the film, we see the life of Charles Foster Kane, starting with his childhood. He began his adult life owning newspaper companies across America, and went on to build the greatest empire the world has ever known.\n\nWhat makes this film so good in the eyes of many viewers and critics? Well for one, the performance given by Orson Welles. All of the cast members give stunning performances, but Welles shines above all. It is hands down, one of the best performances I have ever witnessed. The man is a brilliant actor-and director. At a mere 25 years of age, Welles starred in and directed this film. It is an incredible achievement. Going back to the performance now, Wells's character is in part, why the film is so memorable. Kane is a man you really want to root for in the beginning. Sure, he's a rich businessman, but he's likable. He begins a newspaper business at the New York Inquirer, and promises his readers that he will publish honest, unbiased news.\n\nThe tragedy of the film is Kane's ultimate downfall. Admittedly, you don't really get to know the man. You see this very external side of him, and you never get to see who the man really is on the inside. As he accumulates more and more wealth, he slowly transforms into a very unlikable person. He started out as a somewhat upstanding, honorable man, who seemed to care about the working man and about honesty. By the end of the film, you wonder if that was even the real Kane. As the film progresses, it becomes more self evident that Kane is a very self centered person. He doesn't care for anyone but himself. He piles material wealth around him, building for himself an enormous palace, filled with countless statues.\n\nCitizen Kane has been described as, \"an achievement of cinema\" and \"revolutionary\". Why? Well, I believe it has allot to do with the stunning cinematography. Up until that time, films did not look as they do now. The camera simply followed the subjects around the room, almost seamlessly. Think of the gorgeous shots we see in films today; Roger Deakins, Wally Pfister, and Emmanuel Lubezki come to mind. We notice when a film is shot very well. In this film, Gregg Toland and Wells produce stunning images. The creative lighting is particularly noticeable, and the camera shots are dazzling.\n\nHas this film stood the test of time? For the most part, yes. As a young viewer from the 21st century, this is a hard pill to swallow. It's a daunting task to watch this film. I've heard from most people, \"Citizen Kane is the greatest film ever made\". Are they right? Almost. I wouldn't go so far to say its the best film ever made. Perhaps this will change after multiple viewings. I will say it is one of the best films ever made. It's up there with 2001 A Space Odyssey and Wizard of Oz for sure. Sure, its a little slow, especially the last forty minutes. However, the performances, direction, and camera work kept me watching.\n\nAnother great achievement of this film is its script and direction. This was perhaps what I found most impressive about the film. The script is a masterful piece of writing. The dialogue was some of the greatest dialogue I've ever heard, and it properly and deservedly won an award for its screenplay. Secondly, Orson Welles's direction is superb. Once again, the man was 25 years of age. He acted, co-wrote, and directed this film. It's unbelievable. The man had incredible talent in both acting and setting up shots.\n\n\"Citizen Kane\" is easily one of the best films ever made. Sure, its a little slow towards the end, but overall, I can't complain. It was a privilege watching such a masterpiece. Orson Welles gives a stunning performance, while also directing the film. The script, cinematography, and direction are flawless. The film itself is nearly flawless. Modern audiences may have a hard time watching the film. Its not for everyone, but film lovers should enjoy it. The more I think about it, the more I like it, and the more I want to see it again.",

Anything that they said he couldn't do.. He did.. That was his motivation.. Proving people wrong.. And that motivation created cinematic history. In many ways Citizen Kane was the story of Orson Welles as much as anyone else. He became the character and it shows in the film. Sadly due to the Hearst controversy.. This film did NOT receive the success nor the awards it deserved. Citizen Kane should of made a fortune and won several oscars.. But it didn't..

It's obvious most of the effort was put on the ominous, shadowy cinematography and the innovative use of perspective-altering camera angles.

After watching it for the second time (this time knowing more of what to expect) I found a number of tasty treats.  For one, the fact that Welles played Charle's Foster Kane at all ages (except for boyhood of course) made the performance all the more enjoyable.  Old Kane was just as believable as young Kane.  Even more impressive though were the shots used in the film.  One shot that particularly sticks out was the shot where the camera goes through the sign, and looks down into the bar, where Kane's ex wife was.  Just as impressive was the opening sequence of shots, with the snow globe and the shot of Kane's mother looking at him playing in the snow.  And finally, the most powerful moment was when we see the burning of the name \"rosebud\" on Kane's childhood sled.  This symbolizes the Achilles heal and desire for innocence that Kane feels.  Throughout the movie he desires to be loved.  Probably because he was never really loved growing up.  However, because he was never really loved, he is incapable of loving and therefore incapable of being loved.  By saying the word \"Rosebud\" he harkens himself back to a younger version of himself, where life was simpler and he had the whole world before him.  Citizen Kane is a treat for film lovers and a must see for anyone interested in the art.",

Mi primera impresión es que definitivamente es un filme que estuvo adelantado a su tiempo en los campos de dirección, fotografía y edición, en los cuales fue realmente una cinta visionaria y no dudo que inspiró a varias generaciones de personas en la industria del cine. Sin embargo, considero que las actuaciones son irregulares, en unos momentos son muy buenas, y en otros momentos extrañamente, flojas o no muy pulidas, la música aunque acorde en muchos momentos, no llega a un punto que la coloque en una posición icónica como para ser tan memorable. Y finalmente encuentro curioso que haya toda una polémica sobre quien realmente escribió el guión del filme, ya que honestamente, más allá de la premisa básica no es una historia compleja o tan disfrutable. Creo que en la eterna lucha de cuál es la mejor película de todos los tiempos donde precisamente \"Citizen Kane\" siempre ha competido contra \"Casablanca\" y \"Gone with the Wind\", estos dos últimos filmes son por mucho, mejores, más memorables, más disfrutables y mejor logrados, cada uno a su manera, pero donde \"Citizen Kane\" no tiene lo suficiente para mantenerse en el mismo nivel. Y eso si es que consideramos solo la \"tríada\" que la crítica ha creado, porque ciertamente hay otros filmes igualmente merecedores de entrar en tan reñida pelea, como \"The Godfather\", \"The Schindler's List\", etc... donde obviamente nunca habrá un ganador, ya que todos tenemos nuestros filmes favoritos por muchas diferentes causas y motivos, e incluso donde es realmente imposible lograr un consenso aprobado por todos sobre cuál debería ser considerada la mejor película de todos los tiempos. Pero donde considero que realmente \"Citizen Kane\" no debería figurar. Es un filme relevante para efectos fílmico históricos? Sí. Es una película que cinéfilos fuertes deberían ver aunque sea una vez en su vida, por lo menos para poder opinar sobre el tema? Pues, sí. Pero si bien, es un filme sólido y visionario (en su tiempo) en tres campos muy fuertes de cualquier producción, considero que al final, la experiencia global que te deja no llegar al punto tan alto como la competencia como la mejor película de todos los tiempos.",

            "content": "One of the biggest problems with Citizen Kane is its lofty position on AFI's top movies of all time. Sitting at numero uno means that when you watch it, the film is studied, scrutinized, viewed more as a textbook than what it really is, which is a beautifully crafted balance of script, acting and direction with a simple message beautifully realised through the story of Charles Foster Kane. When viewed through the context of the era, Citizen Kane broke more ground than any number of films put together. With its \"topsy-turvy\" storyline which jumps from interview to flashback and from time zone to time zone within Charlie's life, Citizen Kane was a revelation. But watched through the present day's filter, Citizen may seem to have lost its groundbreaking quallity, it still remains as current and relevant as it was when it was made, possibly even more so in today's environment. This stems from its enduring themes of true happiness and what we wish for most when we lose everything else. \n\nThe film well and truly belongs to Orson Welles. For those who haven't heard of the film titan, Welles was a young up-and-comer in the film industry who seemed deteremined to shake up the system from its foundations. Not only this but he possessed an ungodly talent with film, ludicrously gifted in acting, writing and directing. He did all of this in Citizen Kane and produced the film as well, but the strain which must have existed is never shown when he's onscreen, bringing a passionate, nuanced and larger-than-life performance to his intricately complex lead character, Charlie. He manages to be completely magnetic and effortlessly charming throughout much of the film as well growing old and bitter when the role calls for it. It is an incredible performance, ingrained in reality while being big and bold with a booming voice and an eratic though domineering nature. He's unafraid to make his character unlikeable in many ways, counting on the audience's initial connection with the character to ferry them through the hard times. Welles is of course surrounded by an ensemble of brilliant actors with equally layered performances in their own right. Even though he steals the show, Welles' performance would mean very little without the selfless performances of those around him. The characters they embody are still affected long after Kane's opening death scene, showing the immense impact Kane had upon the lot of them, and it's a credit to the actors that this impact is made so obvious without being explicitly reffered to. \n\nWelles' direction in the film is fantastic. Despite being without the bells and whistles which todays' filmmakers take for granted, Welles manages to capture the imagination of his audience with every frame, whether he's employing his striking sense of symbolism or positioning his audience to whatever frame of mind he wants. Watching movies today it's easy to see the impact that Welles has had upon film, echoing over seventy years. Scorsese's bag of tricks would be severely depleted without Welles as a starting point and Spielberg's understanding of his audience would never be as fully realised without Orson's legacy. Despite slipping into depression and withdrawing almost entirely from the world of film, Welles' impact will always be felt in film and it's exemplified by this, his most complete and realised work. \n\nWelles' script is as packed with symbolism as his direction, but it's never bogged down so entirely in being edgy and profound that it forgets to be funny and, most importantly, real. The entire work is steeped in reality, whether it's an odd turn of phrase or a slight stumble in the delivery of a phrase, Kane is not so stylised that it loses touch with reality. This in turn allows audiences to connect more fully with the characters onscreen, making them real with real problems and real mannerisms, despite their ostentatious and larger-than-life surroundings at times. This especially helps with Charlie's character, turning him from a caricature to someone the audience can connect with. It's fast-paced and unfathomably clever as well as being profound when it wants to be and depressingly real when it needs to be. \n\nKane is a towering achievement, in conception, in execution and in its impact throughout the world of film. Despite being begrudgingly awarded one Oscar by the Academy of the day, Kane continues to be an enduring classic and a source of inspiration for filmmakers everywhere. But despite its intimidating and sometimes damning reputation of being the world's greatest film, when watched for what it is, it's revealed to be playful, real and intricate character study of one man and his impact on those around him, beautifully realised in performances, direction and script alike. \n\nDefining Scene: \nKane admonishes Gettys from the staircase in the middle of the night in the scene where it all went wrong.",

            "content": "Citizen Kane is the Orson Welles masterpiece that reigned supreme as the greatest film ever made for forty fucking years until it was recently dethroned by Hitchcock's Vertigo.  Does it deserve all the high praise and reputation?  Well you'll have to watch it to decide for yourself, but I'll try and tell you why it might.\n\nCitizen Kane is the story of Charles Foster Kane, a billionaire magnate who created a newspaper empire from practically nothing, driven by ambition and the need to do good.  As the years go on, Kane's do-gooding becomes corrupted by the need to acquire more and more power, leading him to a life similar to that of the current .01% class.  \n\nOn his deathbed, Kane drops a snowglobe and utters the words \"rosebud\" hurling the viewer back in time to Kane's early life and telling the story through a series of flashbacks, facilitated by a reporter named Jerry Thompson who is tasked with finding the meaning of the final words.  As the story proceeds we meet people from Kane's life, as Thompson interviews them one by one, attempting to piece together the puzzle of the reclusive Kane's life; and how and why his life was as it was.  \n\nSounds like a pretty boring story huh?  Yeah, well it sort of is.   But a good story is all about how it's being told, and the claim to fame of Citizen Kane is that Welles is one motherfucker of a storyteller.   Rather than using the traditional narrative format of the day, Welles used a non-linear structure, in effect being a storyteller telling the story of a storyteller finding a story told by multiple narrators.  You with me?  The genius of this is that you learn about each character describing Kane through their perception of how Kane was, never really learning the true story, but only how each person thinks it went based on their scope of events.  \n\nAnother thing that Welles had going for him was the attention to detail he paid to how films looked.  While film makers relied on the studio standard for composition, Welles tossed all that shit out the window and made films the way he wanted them to look.  And the way he wanted them to look was better.  Shots with long dining tables had all characters in focus creating a sense of foreboding executives.  The camera was made to shoot from a low angle - sometimes so low that they cut the floor out of the room to fit the camera almost at floor level - giving the cast an imposing sense of power.  Camera movements were long, drawn out and complex, leaving you thinking \"how the fuck did they do that?\" if only you're paying attention to them.  \n\nNot stopping there, Welles went on to hire audio engineers from radio for the best possible fidelity in the audio tracks.  He set microphones farther away from his source so that he could pick up the way a voice sounded in the ambiance of a room.  He layered dialogue, creating overlapping tracks years before Altman ever picked up a camera.  He hired the best makeup people, managing to change Kanes appearance from that of a young man, to that of an old, withered, dying one.  The lighting and set design were carefully planned months in advance - a technique Welles picked up while studying German expressionist films which went so far as to physically paint shadows on the set for effect.\n\nAnd did I mention that Welles wrote, directed, and acted in the entire film, and that this was his first time stepping on to a film set?  Did I also forget to mention he was 24 when the film was released?\n\nTL;DR - 10/10\nTrue, you may not enjoy the film, and its pace may be considered slow, or it's narrative form considered dated.  Nonetheless, Welles' Kane is paramount in the world of film.  Its enduring legacy exists for a reason, and it's not just because of the pioneering techniques it employed to tell its story.  The film is a rare example of a passion project from a director who sought to create something brilliant, and devoted an entire portion of his life to doing so to the utmost of his ability.  The film may not resonate with you as it has with audiences of the past, but it's absolutely essential viewing for anyone who has an interest in film, not only for its own sake, but to acknowledge all the references other films pay in homage to this genuine masterpiece.",

            "content": "Some years ago I got off on the wrong foot with Citizen Kane, so when Belgian television featured it last week, I decided to venture a trip down atonement lane. I'm sorry to say, though, that once again I didn't make it to the end of the lane in a way satisfactory to me. Granted, this movie is a very special one for the time in which it was made. The subject matter is unusual, and the camera work is innovative. It's just that from beginning to end, I couldn't help being bugged by a major sense of \"so what?\". The problem is that I could say many interpretative things about this movie in an attempt to explain it, but I am not sure if the maker actually meant for the viewer to see things this particular way. Forced to analyse Citizen Kane and give a positive review about it, I would probably say something like the following: \"Citizen Kane is about much more than just some person called Charles Foster Kane. It is a story about a twentieth-century American citizen (hence the title of the movie), or, in a wider sense, about a particular aspect of the United States in aforementioned century. In this time period, the States were beginning to blossom as a powerful nation, with powerful, influential figures for whom the sky seemed the limit. Modern media made such figures the focal point of blazing spotlights, and even when the lumen began to border on the absurd, the people still considered them as heroes. Now Citizen Kane does something interesting. Instead of giving the audience such a much-wanted hero, it gives them an antihero, thereby putting this contemporary sense of American heroism into perspective. Charles Foster Kane is not a media tycoon who deserves much credit for the hard work he did. He is not ye typical rags-to-riches man. His money was simply given to him, and everything he did with it ended in failure. Moreover, he is not a nice, engaging sort of man, either to his wives or to the people he worked with. Looking at the grotesque proportions of the empire Xanadu the tycoon has made for himself, we cannot help but think that the American dream and its hero on the pedestal have been farted in the face big time. The irony is complete when it turns out that the only thing in life Kane has ever really loved (enough to bestow with a pet name and refer to in this last words) is a toy from his childhood.\" Bearing all of this in mind, the movie seems very interesting. Unfortunately the actual viewing experience is different. Citizen Kane come across as little more than a pretty dull rendering of a life story of some media tycoon. While watching it, I kept looking at the clock, which is by no means a good sign. And finally, I found the final shot of Rosebud artistically appealing, but not very illuminating, given the angle it was filmed from. During the second watch, I had prior knowledge, but the first time I saw the movie, I kept wondering what that \"shield thing\" had to do with anything. It was Peter \"I just saved you two boobless hours\" Griffin who had to explain to me it was a sled.",

            "content": "Citizen Kane has often been considered one of the best films ever made, and for good reason. The film uses complex and expert composition, camera work, and pioneered new techniques like deep focus, and elaborate camera movements. However, the most impressive part of Citizen Kane is the subtle meanings that can be taken from the composition, if viewed closely enough, it can drastically change a viewer's opinion of the characters. All the while using the life of William Randolph Hearst as a blueprint for the character and story.\n    When discussing Citizen Kane there's a lot to talk about, some of which is more obvious than the rest. One compositional trick the film used was the use of low angle camera frames. This meaning the camera was below Kane quite often to imply power, this often helped reinforce that Kane was a man of great power. The use of camera angles did help reinforce that Kane was a man of power, but was most likely used more for leading audiences to show the duality of the character.\nAnother obvious aspect is that of Deep Focus, and elaborate camera movements, both of which were groundbreaking at the time of release. Citizen Kane's most impressive achievement was that of Deep Focus, a method in which everything in the foreground and background is clearly in focus. Deep Focus was used effectively to show that Kane was important even in frames when he was seemingly trapped. Despite the fact that Kane was a powerful man he's consistently shown as being trapped, helping reinforce the duality of the character.\n    Charles Foster Kane is besides his superficial facade a very tragic character, but it may take a few viewings to realize this. In multiple cases throughout the film composition implies a further meaning, most often the composition is made to make Kane look trapped. The two best examples of this are in the beginning with his parents, and at the midpoint of the film, when Kane is in Susan Alexander's room with Boss Gettys. An understandable question is why Kane shown as being trapped?\n    The answer is given in the beginning, and throughout until the end \"Rosebud.\" Rosebud has it's literal meaning, and the figurative meaning of a lost childhood. However, the film consistently shows the audience that Rosebud represents that Kane is a lonely character, looking for a love he was deprived of before he had a say in the matter. Multiple lines in the film reinforce this for instance when Kane says \"A toast, Jedediah: to Love on my own terms. That's the only terms I've ever known.\" \n    It would seem logical that Susan Alexander paralleled Rosebud, as their affair, is the only time Kane doesn't look lonely. Rosebud being Kane's lost innocence, and love, may have been filled by Susan Alexander, the best evidence of this is that Kane admits he's looking for Rosebud before he meets her, but is distracted by her, symbolizing that she represents the same thing Kane that Rosebud does. In the end however, Kane loses Rosebud again, and he loses Alexander as well. It's impossible to ignore the tragic look of an old lonely Kane who sits in an empty Xanadu, probably wishing he could give it all up for another life, one where he had Rosebud. \n    Rosebud is also theorized to be a reference towards William Randolph Hearst. Film reviewer Gore Vidal theorized that Rosebud was Hearst's nickname for a private region of his mistress Marion Davies, other theories were that it was Hearst's nickname for his childhood bike, either way it seemed to connect to Hearst. It seems obvious that Citizen Kane is based on Hearst's life despite what Welles said. The evidence is that Xanadu is remarkably similar to Hearst Castle, both characters were media moguls who helped start wars, and both had mistresses.\n    Regardless of whether or not Citizen Kane is based on Hearst's life it is still a great film full of meanings. It is so full of meanings, and elaborate compositions it's almost impossible to address all of them, but that's only a testament to the film's sheer quality. At the time the film changed the way filmmakers approached framing, and movement. It seems that still today few films have been so dense with literal, compositional, and figurative meanings as Citizen Kane did. It will forever remain a masterpiece of American Cinema.",

Also his obsession to build Xanadu implies his megalomaniacal ideal to build his own perfect world, which in turn could be appraised as vain, artificial and excessive. The historical setting from 1910s to Great Depression and early 1940s also adds the flavour of American zeitgeist to this movie. 8.5/10",

Based on the life of William Randolph Hearst, Welles directs, stars and co wrote the script with Herman Mankiewicz. This is a great film shot in gorgeous black and white.\n\n              When watching Citizen Kane it is impossible to fully grasp how astonishing Welles is as Kane. Welles Acting is a marvel, Welles was twenty five at the time of filming and plays Kane from twenty five to seventy. I was totally convinced in the opening news reel scenes that through the use of make up and body posture Welles was a man in his fifties. The Editing was innovative for its time. Welles use of transitions were amazing. The opening shot of the snow globe smashing and then cutting to the outside snow was inspiring. I liked the cross dissolve used to covey Charles departure from his parents that starts on his cheek and dissolves into his snow covered sled.\n\n           Citizen Kane is almost universally excepted as the greatest film ever made. Being from another generation I was interested to see the film again, i watched it as a teen but re watched it recently and find with maturity came understanding and an ability to appreciate its genius. The fact that Welles was so young and this was his first film is legendary. This is filmmaking at its highest form and its most artistic.

Now I\nwill say this is very good and the film is firmly that as well, it\ndoesn't have the same effect I think it had back then that it does now\nand has been eclipsed by more modern dramas. Here below I will review\nthe film and tell you why I did though think it was very good.\n\nThe story is an epic tale of intertwined periods of Charles Foster\nKane's life that do go together so well and done so well that even if\nyou get slightly confused, the story telling takes you away from that.\nIt has it's slower moments but most of them lead up to big dramatic\nscenes with powerful exchanges between characters and parts where you\ncan't help feel for the character, whether it is good, or even at times\nbad.\n\nOrson Welles is brilliant at acting in this movie, he by far is the\nbest actor used here and that old thing of people saying the supporting\nactor is the star of the show is cast away with his superb leading\nperformance. Joseph Cotton does well too here and really when the mood\nis more anger or even sadness, he manages to be the one seeming most\ndepressed and down on his luck. Dorothy Comingore I felt although very\nloud and screechy, does a good performance and adds to the wealth of\ngreat actors performing in this picture.\n\nWelles Directs and writes this as if it was easy, simple little scenes\nwith very little going on get wrapped in the key dialogue and great\nchoices of wording to make it actually entertaining. With it also being\nin black an white you may think the brightness never really shows but\nthe script really makes up for any mistakes the film may have as it is\nso delicately done that you feel Welles may just be one of the best\nwriters of all time.\n\nMy review seems very positive yes but the film is not all sublime as It\nlooks, I disliked the middle of the end shall we say with it's\nconfusing back and forth story line and in a sense predictable ending.\nI wanted more on the rosebud theories, I wanted to delve even more into\nhis life but we only see him at his highest success and lowest\nendeavours so it would have been nice to have seen more of his life.\n\nWho to recommend this too?, well the critics love it and so should\nanyone who REALLY get's into classic cinema and enjoys it picking away\nat it's subtle story lines. I can't say some modern audiences would\nenjoy(and not just because of the black and white used) ,it is just\nvery slow and a long movie to say it is all talking pretty much, great\ndrama yes but to some, it could just be a bore-fest. \n\nOverall I give this movie a low 8/10, It is Firmly a Very Good movie and quite\npossibly moving near to being Great. With this you have to not watch it\nas if you have heard the critics applaud it to it's highest level, but\nwatching it not knowing a thing will actually do better, you might not\nenjoy it as much as people say but I still think it is an important\nstep in the history of cinema and for that very reason alone, It is\nessential viewing for any budding critic or cinema lover out there.",

            "content": "\"Rosebud\", the diamond forever lost as the sand ground up into smaller particles, is the unforgettable word that comes to mind whilst I present you my opinion on this, Citizen Kane, one of the greatest movies I have ever witnessed thus far in my living existence.\n\tThe story revolves around Charles Foster Kane separated from his parents to live a more privileged lifestyle at a young age. Later in life, he, portrayed by Orson Welles, works as a newspaper manager (not to mention being expelled from a handful of top-tier universities). Having been increasingly being introduced to the taste of success and wealth, it would congeal his identity in the two marriages which would befall him. The metaphysical synopsis around this movie revolves around a team of reporters that try to unveil the meaning of the word \"Rosebud\", the missing part of the puzzle.\n\tIn the final moments of the flick, quote Peter Griffin, \"It's his sled. It was his sled from when he was a kid.\" Unquote; the sled was burned with all of the other insufficient artifacts of Kane's life. So, if \"Rosebud\" was his sled, what did it mean?\n\tWell, in the scene from when the young Kane was playing in the snow with the sled, you may have heard it say \"Rosebud\"; linking that to many of Americans' youths, we all had this object we would be attached to. Girls would be attached to their Barbie dolls; boys would be attached to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or Power Ranger action figures and video games such as Super Mario, Sonic the Hedgehog, and Crash Bandicoot; well...at least around my time. But of all of this mentioned out, the core of that youth is as kids, we become so attached to those we love dearly, it would be very hard for us to see it all vanish in an instant, yet the longer we grow attached to these artifacts that give us comfort in our youths, the less responsible we would become for ourselves as we grow older. That was probably why Kane's parents sent him away, they wanted what's best for their son; his maximum potential in life.\n\tNow, as Kane's life moves forward, he becomes owner of America's top-leading newspaper chain; a candidate for governor, yet dropped out after being rigged for humiliation of an affair which cost him his first marriage; owner of an opera house for his second wife to follow her dream as an opera singer, yet grew authoritarian in his expectations for his wife, one incident having to fire one of his workers for a negative review on one of the shows; him building this top-notch multi-million dollar mansion of marble and artifacts of the world's top riches, killing his second marriage in the process.\n\tIn The Simpsons episode, \"Mr. Lisa goes to Washington\", the winning candidate (no, it wasn't Lisa Simpson) stated that freedom and success comes at the expense of eternal vigilance. The way that can best relate to this movie as it moves along the Third Act is that Kane has become obsessed with what his second wife wants best in her acting career, he is willing to use whatever is necessary to try to make her happy. Alas, the other newspaper companies say otherwise in regards to her acting, and when she does the math, she demands the right to know why Kane's newspaper company rebels with the mainstream media. As time moves on, she becomes more constrained within what she is allowed to do in her life as long as she's married to Kane; hence she becomes more of an object of Kane in to why he thinks she loves him, leading to the straw that finally broke the camel's back; thus she decides to leave him, inducing Kane to go on a room-wrecking rage, until he finds a snow globe with a house on-par with the one in his youth, stares at it for a moment and murmurs, \"Rosebud\" (no, he didn't hit the ground).\n\tWith all of that said and done, I can now best assume the Kane means \"Rosebud\" as a reminder of the day his parents sent him away; he was on his sled named \"Rosebud\" when the man came to pick him up, to be carried off into the apprenticeship of capitalism. While Kane's success did bring him friends, it also created enemies; thus he is willing to drown out their voices by means of his own tools he enhanced out of, and at the end of the day, he would still be full of his egotistic successes. Had he not left home at youth, he would be more of a humble man, one who would be successful; not to show it off every day, per-se.\n\tOverall, \"Citizen Kane\", with its truth in the certain dangers of the American capitalist workings and the top-notch performance, is really more than worth the watch; it's worth the understanding of a certain aspect life.",

            "content": "Vertigo has only topped Citizen Kane as the greatest film of all time on Sight and Sound magazine's critics poll just two years ago, but that hasn't stopped this film in radiating it's power to the general public. Some people haven't even seen Citizen Kane and they know it's the greatest film of all time because society for so long has kept that stamp on it, that it's hard to argue so. I have spoken before about reviewing or discussing films that are regarded as classics, and one cannot always share the same opinion as everyone else. Some argue that this film is the best film of all time, while I see how one can praise this film, I felt that the film isn't perfect. Don't take this statement as a matter of fact but rather a form of opinion and one can choose to agree or disagree with it.\n\nCitizen Kane was written by Herman J. Mankiewicz and Orson Welles. What Welles and Mankiewicz have written here is a character study of Charles Foster Kane. It explores his entire life, touching on his relationships and career while tied together with a search for the meaning of his last spoken word before his passing, \"Rosebud\". The film begins with a short documentary detailing Kane's life and it takes the point of view of the general public. It doesn't give us the whole picture of the man, so the film allows to explore and understand the character through the stories and opinions of his closest relationships. For most of the film, I was fascinated on what made this man so important and was curious on the reason behind that final word. Rosebud ties everything up together, and answers all of our questions at the end without actually fully explaining itself. I found this approach to be quite satisfying as the writers wanted us to make the connection ourselves and create our own interpretation of it's meaning. Kane is an interesting character, he does what he does because it allows him to try and fill a void that is empty but in doing so, it causes pain to others and have led him to a road of self sabotage. The aspects of the screenplay that I found less exciting was it's detailing of his relationship with the \"singer\". I understood that her story was also important but I never found it to be that interesting, especially when it is compared to the rising story of his newspaper tycoon or his attempt to be involved in politics. Once it touched on that side of the story, mostly during the second marriage, I never was hooked and hoped that it was better written. The dialogue in the film was quite engaging, as each word being said allows us to get closer and closer with solving the puzzle that is Charles Foster Kane. At times it does feel like, Welles is indulgent in his writing, allowing himself to have the best lines and leaving others feeling like they're just minor supporting players and seem unimportant.\n\nCitizen Kane was Orson Welles' debut film and what a great way to start your career as a director. Welles wanted this film to be truly focused on the protagonist and let everything else just be present to support it. It makes the film feel like a one-man show and it makes it harder for the audience to connect with other characters. When a certain tragedy occured late in the film that didn't physically affect Kane, I simply didn't care because Welles didn't want us to. He simply wanted our eyes to be focusing on Kane and look through his layers, not anybody else's. This may cause the director and the film to come off as pretentious, but sometimes that's the ingredient that makes a film great. Welles sets the film in a non-linear style of storytelling, having the film move through flashbacks from the members of Kane's life. I found this interesting because it allows us to see different perspectives of the man, and give us a better understanding of who he was. But because he has the film be told in the perspective of these separate individuals, we never get to the core of the character, which Welles leaves for us until the end. Welles was so confident in his material, that he didn't need to add any violence or sex to keep the audience interested. The film rarely feels slow, as Welles just allows the material to bloom and indulge itself. This approach wouldn't have worked if the film lacked a great script. As every scene passes, I always look forward to the next clue that would be given to us because I am so eager in finishing the puzzle.\n\nThe film's cinematography was handled by Gregg Toland. Aside from Citizen Kane, he has worked on notable films like The Grapes of Wrath and The Best Years Of Our Lives. Toland's work here is definitely a stand out. I was fascinated in his choices of lighting the scene. He uses low key lighting to illuminate the shot and creating wonderful shadows. This style is commonly found on noir films during that time, and Citizen Kane changed the rules of it's use. Welles and Toland has created deep shadows in covering our detective making him look faceless, which I felt was appropriate because the audience didn't truly need to know who he was and why we have to care, all we needed to care about was Kane. The man also was in way a representation of us, asking the questions that we would ask and seeing what he would see. Toland has the camera usually set up behind this character because the man and the audience are always at the same page. The film also consists many instances of low-angle shots giving off a sense of power and importance of this character. It is normal for a film to look down on it's characters, especially on the moments where they are wounded or in a state of shame, but the film never applies that when Kane is on screen. Citizen Kane is also an opportunity for Toland to show off his experimentation with the use of deep focus shots. There were a couple of moments that looked beautiful when employing this technique, but for a few times throughout the film, I felt that it was repetitive and overstayed it's welcome. I completely understand that it was something new and groundbreaking back then and that it was used to make the film look one of a kind. I just personally feel like it could have been reduced a bit, in order for it to not draw too much attention to itself.\n\nThe film's score was composed by the legendary Bernard Herrmann. He has written so many of my favorite film scores; Psycho and Taxi Driver. Citizen Kane was his first film and that may have been a factor on why his work here isn't as impressive as it could have been. I personally felt that Citizen Kane's score lacked that sort of gem that makes his best score shine, the slashing strings on Psycho or the sleazy saxophone on Taxi Driver. I guess i'm just being overly critical. Overall it isn't abysmal, just underwhelming.\n\nThe acting in this film feels like it's carried solely by Orson Welles. Welles truly feels like he is in touch with the character, with him also being one of the writers, he can tap into the mind and understand the inner workings of Kane. He was able to play multiple stages of the man, from when he was fresh young face in the start of his newspaper tycoon or the fragile old man living in an isolated castle. His perforamnce was also supported by the impressive use of make up effects in making him seem much older than what he was. Welles' most impressive scene is where he is in a room, destroying everything he sees in it. This scene is the closest connection I felt, along with the reveal at the end, to gaining a connection with his \"Rosebud\". The film contains a average supporting cast that is never at par with Welles' performance. Everett Sloane as Mr. Bernstein and Joseph Cotten as Jedediah Leland were quite fun to watch. I did find Dorothy Comingore to be quite annoying, delivering lines that feel very over the top and cheesy. It does stand out even more when she is conversing back and forth with Welles.\n\nCitizen Kane isn't a perfect film in my eyes but it is a great film. It does so many things right that it's hard to give the film a lower score. The film boasts a strong script, groundbreaking cinematography and a stand out perforamnce from Welles albeit with minor imperfections in all three categories. It may grow on me later on, as I would have grown and understood cinema much better and therefore would change my perspective of the film.",

Despite all of his TV appearances over the years, and films he acted in to fund his own productions, the first time I was aware of Orson Welles was one of those startling and bizarrely professional yet unmistakably charismatic 'Paul Masson' wine commercials that they tend to make fun of on The Simpsons in these decades gone by. My first thought was 'that voice is amazing', then 'he looks like he'd be a fine grandfather or Santa Claus', and I instantly wanted to know who he was: Just the way he carried himself, I knew he must be both brilliant and someone who was really important.\n\nAs you can tell, I'm not going to unnecessarily repeat all the endless accolades this film has gotten over the years. If you're any type of film lover, you have either seen this or will eventually--unless you're hit by a bus tomorrow (Heaven forbid) or something else drastic. It's a hallmark of what is possible in cinema. I waited until I was 46 to see this, because of its stellar reputation. It's not my favourite Welles--either acting or directing, and not by a long shot in either regard--but I'm very glad that I finally saw it, and I'll probably revisit it every couple of years for the rest of my life. There's just something really special about it that's hardly ever seen any more--and I think of that just as wistfully as Charles Foster Kane did about his beloved 'Rosebud'. That a 25-year-old could be so gleefully and breathtakingly experimental and innovative, yet still endlessly entertain, is nothing short of miraculous.",

            "content": "It seems hard to call this movie in any other way than \"the greatest film ever made\". Well, it certainly changed the media forever with its cinematography and form of storytelling, along with its 100% fitting music, it's character analysis (something new back then; we can say this movie started the wide character development that movies require since) and its still impressive focus on each shot that delivers a clear view of each plain. It is a great movie, but personally, I don't think it's the best of the best. It is inventive and great, awesome, but if I didn't felt it was the best I've seen, I can't call the movie in such way. Still, based on my experience, it is one of the greatest.\n\nAs I said, it's like if I don't call this the best movie ever, then everybody would call me a tasteless bastard that knows nothing about movies. But the term \"best movie of all time\" is debatable. Many also call The Godfather the greatest movie, also The Wizard of Oz, Casablanca, etc. But Kane seems to be the most constant on the best lists as No.1; including it on a personal Top 10 list itself is kinda clichéd nowadays. Nevertheless, while not the best movie ever made, it is one of the hardest films to hate, it's almost impossible. Sure, if you're between 8-17 years old, you won't get this film at all and hate it, or at least that's what you think. When you are more into characters than entertainment, Citizen Kane grabs you from the beginning, as you also want to know what \"Rosebud\" means.\n\nNow, let's get to the movie itself: The way the story is told, the way it was shot, the way ot was acted, the way it was presented; all of that was new back then and changed everything for movies. From that moment on, this became the prime example of how to make a movie. Each shot of the movie is so clear and has such an atmosphere...that delivers such a viewing experience unlike any other. How it uses many plains to show you all with the same clarity and focus was the perfect visual for movies since. The character analysis itself was new for that time, but even here is executed in a unique way. Each is a bit of story from the Kane character's life as told by people that knew him, that shared with him, that loved him, that hated him, thus actually sharing a true analysis by these people. Hell, probably the Kane we saw in the film was not entirely the real one, as it could be an interpretation of the person talking about him! It's too much deep for a 1941 movie, but that's the magnificence of the movie: it delivers everything and then some. Only masterpieces can do that: grow a profound analysis after the very first view of only its best details. Because when you think about it, ¿How did anyone know that Kane's last word was Rosebud when nobody was with him when he died? Even Orson Welles was like \"Do never talk about that\" when his friends in production talk him to it.\n\nDon't think the analysis is that great? It is, even for today's standards: We see his rise, fall, and many other aspects of his life, and we do get emotional connections, thus feeling what Kane feels and that way, we live with him. Seeing him happy makes you happy because you understand why, and the same goes for every emotion he delivers, all with the superb acting of Orson Welles. With that reviewed, now to other details. The little details make a movie loveable, and how would a film like Citizen Kane not have these?\n\nWe have details such as the shadows, the fact that you never see the reporter's face, the way there's always someone in the forthground, in the middle ground and in the backgroung, the way it transcends from one shot to another during the flashbacks, etc. All these are highly noticeable and gives the movie, like any other movie, its own charm. A supreme film by any means, Citizen Kane, while not the best film ever, IS the best example of filmmaking, as it does everything right in all its elements: the writing, the acting, the cinematography, the music, everything. So good, so great, it still holds up today, and will hold up as long as the eternity is...eternal.",

            "content": "Citizen Kane is a film that deserves all the acclaim it has gotten, and I cannot argue with anyone who says it is the greatest film of all time. This is a film unlike any other to come out before it, and unlike most everything after it; Citizen Kane doesn't confine itself to a single genre, it's a drama with high emotional and intellectual intensity, but it's also quite funny at times, and has a mystery/thriller element to it as well. Everything about this film is near perfect, and incredibly ambitious, from the direction and camerawork to the unique nonlinear and psychological screenplay. Charles Foster Kane is probably the most complex and morally ambiguous character ever to be put the screen until this point. He begins as a man who is merely trying to give the people what he thinks they deserve, which is the truth, but when these people refuse to give him their love, he responds by trying to force them to love him. He uses manipulative media tactics to \"gain\" their love, obviously it doesn't work, and he then tries to force his wife to love him. Kane gives Susan Alexander everything she ever wants, but it doesn't win her love. If Kane is greedy, it is not for money or things, it is greed for love,  the only reason he has pursued money and power is because he thought this would make people love him. His only desire is to be loved, yet no one will love him, and it is saddening to see a man torn down by his loveless life, but it is also infuriating to see his overbearing and vindictive actions. Kane is a character that we feel both pity and angst towards, and this is a product of one of the greatest screenplays ever written. However, the script is not all there is to be praised, Welles' in his debut shows more audacity with the camera, lighting, and character arrangement than has ever been put to the screen until this point. He uses various angles and character distancing techniques to portray the relationship of the characters visually, which is something the cinema had never seen before. Welles' also gives an amazing performance as Charles Foster Kane, as does Joseph Cotten as Jed Leland, they perfectly capture the essence of their characters. Citizen Kane is a stunning achievement in the world of filmmaking, and is about as entertaining and intelligent as any film can aspire to be. Show me someone who doesn't like Citizen Kane, and I'll show you a person who hates life.",

He mutters the word \"Rosebud\" and then he passes away.\n\nThe whole story, we learn about Kane's seemingly fortunate life through one journalist who is trying to discover the truth behind Kane's last word through interviews and stories told from some of Kane's loved ones.\n\nWe learn about Kane's life, from when he was a child when his parents had to give him up so he could have a better life, to when he became publisher of the Daily Inquirer, to when he married twice, had an affair, and divorced twice, and to his final word.\n\nAs the audience learns of Kane's life and also of his greatest achievement of creating the most costliest construction of any man made masterpiece since the Egyptian pyramids, this, known as Xanadu, we learn that Kane truly had all that he could ever want in his life. He had major wealth, fame, and material items. \n\nAt the end, the newspaper, for which the journalist is apart of, comes up with that this so called \"Rosebud\" \"was something he couldn't get, or something he lost.\"\n\n\"Mr. Kane was a man who got everything he wanted, and then lost it.\"\n\n(SPOILER) In the end, plans go forth to destroy Xanadu and everything in it. The camera pans to this big fireplace that is burning some of Kane's possessions. Someone throws in Kane's sled he had when he was a kid. He was having the time of his life with this sled just before his parents forced him away so he could live a better life. The sled is named \"Rosebud\" and we learn that his sled is what he was speaking of when Kane passed.\n\nThe message in this brilliantly filmed film is quite simple; the message of that money does not buy love. Kane had everything he wanted and cared for when he was with his real parents and his sled. His parents basically forced him to leave so he could make a life for himself.\n\nKane spent his whole life trying to find love through his job, his marriages, his affairs, and then Xanadu. But all he really needed was his sled.\n\nThis is such a beautiful film with outstanding cinematography, writing, and acting.\n\nCitizen Kane is Entertainment Weekly's official number one film from the past 100 years. Shawshank Redemption is IMDb's top film of all time. I will watch Shawshank and I will try to think which one is better.\n\nCitizen Kane, I give you a 100%.",

            "content": "Vertigo has only topped Citizen Kane as the greatest film of all time on Sight and Sound magazine's critics poll just two years ago, but that hasn't stopped this film in radiating it's power to the general public. Some people haven't even seen Citizen Kane and they know it's the greatest film of all time because society for so long has kept that stamp on it, that it's hard to argue so. I have spoken before about reviewing or discussing films that are regarded as classics, and one cannot always share the same opinion as everyone else. Some argue that this film is the best film of all time, while I see how one can praise this film, I felt that the film isn't perfect. Don't take this statement as a matter of fact but rather a form of opinion and one can choose to agree or disagree with it.\n\nCitizen Kane was written by Herman J. Mankiewicz and Orson Welles. What Welles and Mankiewicz have written here is a character study of Charles Foster Kane. It explores his entire life, touching on his relationships and career while tied together with a search for the meaning of his last spoken word before his passing, \"Rosebud\". The film begins with a short documentary detailing Kane's life and it takes the point of view of the general public. It doesn't give us the whole picture of the man, so the film allows to explore and understand the character through the stories and opinions of his closest relationships. For most of the film, I was fascinated on what made this man so important and was curious on the reason behind that final word. Rosebud ties everything up together, and answers all of our questions at the end without actually fully explaining itself. I found this approach to be quite satisfying as the writers wanted us to make the connection ourselves and create our own interpretation of it's meaning. Kane is an interesting character, he does what he does because it allows him to try and fill a void that is empty but in doing so, it causes pain to others and have led him to a road of self sabotage. The aspects of the screenplay that I found less exciting was it's detailing of his relationship with the \"singer\". I understood that her story was also important but I never found it to be that interesting, especially when it is compared to the rising story of his newspaper tycoon or his attempt to be involved in politics. Once it touched on that side of the story, mostly during the second marriage, I never was hooked and hoped that it was better written. The dialogue in the film was quite engaging, as each word being said allows us to get closer and closer with solving the puzzle that is Charles Foster Kane. At times it does feel like, Welles is indulgent in his writing, allowing himself to have the best lines and leaving others feeling like they're just minor supporting players and seem unimportant.\n\nCitizen Kane was Orson Welles' debut film and what a great way to start your career as a director. Welles wanted this film to be truly focused on the protagonist and let everything else just be present to support it. It makes the film feel like a one-man show and it makes it harder for the audience to connect with other characters. When a certain tragedy occured late in the film that didn't physically affect Kane, I simply didn't care because Welles didn't want us to. He simply wanted our eyes to be focusing on Kane and look through his layers, not anybody else's. This may cause the director and the film to come off as pretentious, but sometimes that's the ingredient that makes a film great. Welles sets the film in a non-linear style of storytelling, having the film move through flashbacks from the members of Kane's life. I found this interesting because it allows us to see different perspectives of the man, and give us a better understanding of who he was. But because he has the film be told in the perspective of these separate individuals, we never get to the core of the character, which Welles leaves for us until the end. Welles was so confident in his material, that he didn't need to add any violence or sex to keep the audience interested. The film rarely feels slow, as Welles just allows the material to bloom and indulge itself. This approach wouldn't have worked if the film lacked a great script. As every scene passes, I always look forward to the next clue that would be given to us because I am so eager in finishing the puzzle.\n\nThe film's cinematography was handled by Gregg Toland. Aside from Citizen Kane, he has worked on notable films like The Grapes of Wrath and The Best Years Of Our Lives. Toland's work here is definitely a stand out. I was fascinated in his choices of lighting the scene. He uses low key lighting to illuminate the shot and creating wonderful shadows. This style is commonly found on noir films during that time, and Citizen Kane changed the rules of it's use. Welles and Toland has created deep shadows in covering our detective making him look faceless, which I felt was appropriate because the audience didn't truly need to know who he was and why we have to care, all we needed to care about was Kane. The man also was in way a representation of us, asking the questions that we would ask and seeing what he would see. Toland has the camera usually set up behind this character because the man and the audience are always at the same page. The film also consists many instances of low-angle shots giving off a sense of power and importance of this character. It is normal for a film to look down on it's characters, especially on the moments where they are wounded or in a state of shame, but the film never applies that when Kane is on screen. Citizen Kane is also an opportunity for Toland to show off his experimentation with the use of deep focus shots. There were a couple of moments that looked beautiful when employing this technique, but for a few times throughout the film, I felt that it was repetitive and overstayed it's welcome. I completely understand that it was something new and groundbreaking back then and that it was used to make the film look one of a kind. I just personally feel like it could have been reduced a bit, in order for it to not draw too much attention to itself.\n\nThe film's score was composed by the legendary Bernard Herrmann. He has written so many of my favorite film scores; Psycho and Taxi Driver. Citizen Kane was his first film and that may have been a factor on why his work here isn't as impressive as it could have been. I personally felt that Citizen Kane's score lacked that sort of gem that makes his best score shine, the slashing strings on Psycho or the sleazy saxophone on Taxi Driver. I guess i'm just being overly critical. Overall it isn't abysmal, just underwhelming.\n\nThe acting in this film feels like it's carried solely by Orson Welles. Welles truly feels like he is in touch with the character, with him also being one of the writers, he can tap into the mind and understand the inner workings of Kane. He was able to play multiple stages of the man, from when he was fresh young face in the start of his newspaper tycoon or the fragile old man living in an isolated castle. His perforamnce was also supported by the impressive use of make up effects in making him seem much older than what he was. Welles' most impressive scene is where he is in a room, destroying everything he sees in it. This scene is the closest connection I felt, along with the reveal at the end, to gaining a connection with his \"Rosebud\". The film contains a average supporting cast that is never at par with Welles' performance. Everett Sloane as Mr. Bernstein and Joseph Cotten as Jedediah Leland were quite fun to watch. I did find Dorothy Comingore to be quite annoying, delivering lines that feel very over the top and cheesy. It does stand out even more when she is conversing back and forth with Welles.\n\nCitizen Kane isn't a perfect film in my eyes but it is a great film. It does so many things right that it's hard to give the film a lower score. The film boasts a strong script, groundbreaking cinematography and a stand out perforamnce from Welles albeit with minor imperfections in all three categories. It may grow on me later on, as I would have grown and understood cinema much better and therefore would change my perspective of the film.",

It truly is a masterpiece, creating a mystery in its first moments, then masterfully attempting to unravel this mystery through flashbacks. This film is emotionally engaging, it revolutionized filmmaking, and it gives us one of the greatest screen characters of all time.\n        Citizen Kane tells us the life story of newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane. In the film's opening moments, Kane dies and utters what is probably the most famous word in cinematic history, \"Rosebud\". After seeing a newsreel explaining Kane's life, (which will later allow us to navigate the maze of flashbacks to come), a young reporter, Jerry Thompson, is given the duty of discovering the meaning of Kane's dying words.\n        Thompson then leads us through a dizzying sequence of flashbacks chronicling Kane's life. The story works best if the viewer doesn't try to pinpoint exactly where we are at any point in time. Uncertainty in the viewer's mind, I imagine, was part of Orson Welles' intent when he was making this film. Uncertainty enhances the mystery of Rosebud. Thompson meets with several of the people that Kane knew best, uncovering a little bit more about him with each new flashback. The beauty of the film is that the more we learn about Kane, the more we realize that we will never be able to fully understand him.\n        Orson Welles truly does give us one of the greatest screen characters of all time with his performance as Kane. Citizen Kane stands up next to T.E. Lawrence, Han Solo, George Bailey, and Atticus Finch as a character who is nearly impossible to forget. Welles masterfully portrays Kane from his 20s into his 70s. He hits every emotional note perfectly. From Kane's idealism to his apathy, his joy to his sorrow, his hope to his fear and anger, Welles embodies the character. William Alland also deserves credit for his portrayal of Thompson. He leads on the journey of understanding Kane. He, in a way, is watching the film with us.\n        This film embraces the enormity of human complexity. As the film progresses, it becomes more and more evident that one word can never explain who Kane truly was and it was foolish for us to think it could. How can we expect to fully know Kane when most of us hardly know ourselves? Citizen Kane deftly explains to us what flawed, magnificent, incredibly complex creatures human being are. It is a tribute to the magnificence of the human condition as well as an acknowledgement that we are imperfect and often helpless. Citizen Kane is, quite simply, one of the greatest films of all time.",

Orson Wells crafts a picture that tells a simple, subtle story that works brilliantly in capturing your attention from the first frame onwards. The cast do an immaculate job in their performances and each actor brings something unique to the screen to really make this film standout among other classics. Wells direction is terrific and he is able to craft a story that uses basic elements to create something truly remarkable with this picture. Orson Wells also stars in the film as the lead characters, Charles Kane who is a powerful tycoon   Wells is superb in the part, and his work behind the camera is immaculate, fluent and brings the viewer into a truly special experience. The film is a must see due to its significance to the cinematic medium. Citizen Kane is a film that has stood the test of time, and yet again proves that the best pictures are the ones that tell a good story that is simple, yet well told and elevated by a talented cast that add so much to the film to make it a truly outstanding piece of cinema. Cinema fans owe it to themselves to check this treasure and Wells is a wonderful director that has crafted an excellent, engaging and memorable film that you soon won't forget. The picture is flawless and it has stood out among other classics. With that being said, is this my favorite of classic cinema? It isn't, but it definitely is among the finest pieces of work of this era and any era for that matter. I'd have to say that Casablanca is my favorite, with Citizen Kane a close second. Either way, this is a sweeping masterpiece of film, one that has stood out and lives on through each decade as an exemplary film that each new viewer can take something out from the film. Citizen Kane is a flawless picture that has its place secured in cinematic history.",

On this night, right before the stars have fully fallen, I can now say that I have been given the privilege of watching Orson Welles' magnum opus. \n\nThough this film was concocted during the Golden Age of Cinema back in the early years of the 1940's, its elaborate, yet satisfying allegories, symbolism, archetypes delves the even the youngest of viewers near the edges of their seats. \n\nOrson Welles masterfully plays the role of a newspaper tycoon who, in an attempt to gain everything he thinks he wants, loses everything he has ever had a care for. The tragic epic displays profound themes and messages involving power, pride, love, and the loss of one's innocence. \n\nIt would not be right to exclude the cornerstone piece of cinematic and American history from any movie collection. A combination of paramount themes, magnificent storytelling, and an overall timeless feel gets Citizen Kane my highest rating.\n\n5/5",

Being a movie that gets alot of hype with its title as 'the greatest movie of all time,' I can clearly see why. Is it the greatest of movie of all time? I don't know and that is up to your opinion, but all I can say is that I try not to watch films with those impressions influencing my expectations. Although what I can say is that I greatly appreciate this film and I can accept the praise and I feel it is one of the best films I have ever watched.\n\nDespite being from the 40's, this movie somehow feels fresh to me, even today in this day and age! The way that this story is told feels so intrinsic. The movie begins with an introduction of the whole story that really took me off guard at first, but then I realized it didn't tell the human aspects of the story that was to follow and this is one of the most unique introductions in a movie I have ever seen. You think you know the whole story from this mini-documentary styled intro, but this is still a jigsaw puzzle that still needs to be solved by the people who know Kane personally to fill in most of the blanks, especially the mystery of 'Rosebud.' Kane was a powerful figure, but a character who also had a sense of humanity and through this, it's easy to feel a connection to Kane. As we delve into the human aspect of the film, we become more and more immersed with the story and it is a very human story, in my opinion. This to me is what makes the movie effective.\n\nAnd what also astounds about the story is that it feels complete and it did not need to have anything else added to enhance or add further drama to the story. You would think a movie that tries to tell a story of a man's life young to old would feel rushed, but at this running time, it feels like you know the guy! Never have I seen such character development this good and fleshed out on film. And to top it all off, the makeup looks very realistic, along with Orson Welle's acting, which perfectly pulls it off for his different ages thorughout the movie.\n\nAnd that is only a few of the great aspects of this film. The great cinematography techniques in the movie have definitely made me more analytical and aware of these intricacies in film. Not only is the story filled with ambition, but you can see it in the beautiful visuals. From Kane's huge, but sparse mansion to scenes utilizing chiaroscuro, you can see the influence it had on films today. From starring and also directing this film, you can see from watching the film the amount of ambition that Orson Welles poured out into this epic.\n\nAfter watching Citizen Kane, I cannot help but feel like there has been a transition from me being a casual movie watcher to a serious film buff. With its simple, but grandiose story, its breathtaking visuals and even the music that perfectly compliments every scene, this movie has become a timeless beauty that ages like fine wine.",

At the time I dare say it was interesting to middle-aged adults but it really holds very little for me at this stage in my life.\n\nI'm going to address some specifics from the Wikipedia article:\n\nCinematography- unless you are a film buff who knew what to look for, the unique way in which camera shots were done will be completely lost on you as they were for me. There really was no such thing as cinematography before color. I hate to have to say that but it is true. If this film had been done in color, it would have been amazing cinematography. You can praise the creators for their remarkable work but that doesn't mean that it is enjoyable to watch for any reason other than cinema history.\n\nspecial effects- some camera tricks. Not much interesting.\n\nmakeup- transforming himself into Old Kane took Orson Wells several hours. The end result is impressive.\n\nSoundtrack- really uninteresting to the casual watcher. There are some interesting comparisons to radio music that are probably justified but just because I find a way to bring a new style to movies doesn't make it a good movie. It makes it art but not necessarily a good movie.\n\nWikipedia also goes on and on about William Randolf Hearst's reaction to the film. Really, that only matters to people interested in cinema history.\n\nSUMMARY: A boring movie but it has some interesting ideas that I might ponder for future use. I won't recommend this film but I won't say not to watch it either.",

The film is a mystery/drama film that revolves around the life and death of Charles Foster Kane. Charles Foster Kane's last and final words before he died were \"Rosebud,\" then he dropped a snow globe once he died. The mystery is what does \"rosebud\" mean? It goes back into his entire life, and shows all of the biggest things that happened in his life. He owned a newspaper business, and the reporters for it are the ones trying to figure out the meaning of his last words.\n\nOrson Welles was the genius mastermind behind this all time great classic. He co-wrote the screenplay with Herman J. Mankiewicz, he directed it, and even acted as Kane himself. All of the themes in this film that are clichés now he invented, and you appreciate him even more now knowing how inspiration his work was. In order to truly appreciate old films like this when you are seventeen years old like me, you need to know a little bit more about it before you start watching. You need to know how it inspired all of your favorite modern day films. All these old directors of all of these old films are the true geniuses. Even though old films like this may not seem as good nowadays because we have way more technology now, are still great if you still have a strong appreciation for films, and if you know the effect they had on the world at the time. The film is an acquired taste for somebody my age. But like all other acquired tastes its fantastic once you acquire it.\n\nSome of these clichés are going back into the protagonist's life to show how he/her got to that point in their life. Another one is the protagonist's rise to fame, and when he/she goes down hill, because he/she isolates themselves from their family, and is only focused on work. Kane becomes more distant from his wife, the deeper he gets into the newspaper business, and politics. You will figure out the meaning of \"rosebud\" in the final scene of the film, but I won't spoil it for you.\n\nOne thing with old movies is that the actresses are all terrible. They are too dramatic, and they tend to do all of these big heavy sighs that are annoying today. Also they tend to all talk the same way. They have these really fake accents that make them sound like little girls. The men sound the same too, but they sound good, and more powerful. The women too me back in old movies are always annoying. That's the only thing I don't like about old films.\n\nBut overall this is one of the all time great masterpieces of filmmaking that I hope that more people my age will come to appreciate for what it is. Because it is a huge deal for movies.",

Não é o melhor filme que eu já vi, e nem o segundo, o queridinho dos críticos e campeão de listas, não deu um soco na minha cara ou me sequestrou por duas horas mas é sim um excelentíssimo filme e igualmente marcante. Citizen Kane é um drama com suspense cravado na sua medula, lançado em 1941 fruto da mente brilhante de Orson Welles que produziu, dirigiu e atuou, o restante do elenco se resumi a novatos como: Joseph Cotten, Dorothy Comingore e Agnes Moorehead. Citizen Kane é o primeior filme de Welles e foi indicado a nove oscar, vencendo na categoria melhor roteiro.\nApós o sucesso de Welles no teatro com a companhia Mercury Theatre e sua controversa transmissão de rádio de A Guerra dos Mundos, em 1938, Hollywood o acolheu. Ele assinou um contrato com a RKO Pictures em 1939. Foi-lhe dada a liberdade para desenvolver sua própria história e usar seu próprio elenco e da equipe, o que é raro para um novo diretor. Depois de duas tentativas frustradas para realizar um projeto, desenvolveu o roteiro de Citizen Kane com Herman Mankiewicz.\nA história examina a vida e legado de Charles Foster Kane, um personagem interpretado por Welles e com base no magnata da imprensa William Randolph Hearst e do próprio Orson Welles. Durante seu lançamento, Hearst proibiu de mencionar o filme em seus jornais. A carreira de Kane na indústria editorial nasceu do idealismo e do serviço social, mas gradualmente se transformou em uma perseguição implacável ao poder. Narrado principalmente através de flashbacks, a história é contada por meio da investigação de um jornalista que quer saber o significado da última palavra que ele disse antes do magnata morrer: Rosebud.",

Its biographical composition is epic and ambitious and has been copied by numerous other films that followed. The photography is a revolutionary spectacle, making use of Gregg Toland's ground breaking deep focus technique, which added depth and played on shadows and lights in a way which hadn't been quite seen since the introduction of sound in movies. Orson Welles as the titular anti-hero delivers a stunning, powerful and majestic performance, representing with his Kane the decadence and narcissism of power gluttony.

He decides to invest his fortune in the newspaper business as well as in rare statues.  On his death bed, he utters a strange phrase.

The storyline for this picture is breathtaking and a wonderful character study.  The character development and storyline perspectives were awesome.  The cast delivers mesmerizing performances and includes Orson Welles, Joseph Cotton, Dorothy Comingore, Ruth Warrick, and Ray Collins.\r\n\r\n\"You're going to need more than one lesson.  And you're going to get more than one lesson.\"\r\n\r\nI have been meaning to see this picture for a long time so when I discovered this was airing on Turner Classic Movies (TCM) I was so excited.  This movie was very well put together with an amazing lead character that was presented with perfect arrogance, aura, and in a very mysterious way.  I absolutely adored Orson Wells performance and strongly recommend seeing this picture.  It is definitely worth adding to your DVD collection.\r\n\r\n\"Really, Charles.

I highly recommend seeing the battle of citizen Kane as well, which describes this. I thought it was a special features disc, so i almost didn't watch it. I was actually delighted to find out it was a documentary on the behind the scenes story of the movie. Wow this movie was ahead of its time. At first I was kinda confused cuz it has a unique intro, I was like is this the movie? By the end I was still wanting to see and know more about this Kane, that's when u know a movie or book is good. It lingers with you after it's done. Kane is incredibly charismatic and who isn't obsessed with knowing more about the fantastically rich n famous. What a unique message too with a unique character I didn't see that coming. It got really interesting about half way thru when u start to see his character flaws n get inside his life. Just shows that u can have everything in life n still can be empty inside. Not only is that so strong but the script is great, the acting, and all the technical details like shots, lighting, n music. The cinematography is beautiful. Now I see what all the fuss is about. I also love the pacing of this movie n how it keeps ur interest with all the different characters n stories. I recommend it n the documentary on it. I just can't believe I never heard of Hearst before or Welles except for his Martian radio stunt. You can tell u r watching something great when u see it. Btw movie is completely diff than what I thought it was about a personally falsely accused of being communist n torn to shreds by a newspaper lies. I can't believe a 24 year old made this.",
