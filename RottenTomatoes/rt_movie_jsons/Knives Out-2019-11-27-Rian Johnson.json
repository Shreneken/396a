            "content": "Knives Out - How to do a Plot Twist\n\nI have never seen a better example of subverting expectations than in Rian Johnson's Knives Out. If you want to shock your audience and do it right rather than some cheap trick, then there is no better case study than this film. There are rarely other films like this that perform a plot twist so effortlessly.\nFirst of all, the plot twist we're talking about is Hugh Ransom Drysdale (played by the evil sweater wearing Chris Evans) being revealed as the true killer instead of Marta (played by Ana De Armas) which is believed to be the one almost throughout the entirety of the film.\n\nThe reason why Knives Out's plot twist works so well is because the film flips genres after a third of the way through. The entire first act is about it being a whodunit mystery; but, at the end of the first act, it exactly tells us what happened and who did it (in this case, Marta) and seemingly answers all our questions. All of a sudden, with the flip of a coin, it's no longer a whodunit; it's how the hell is Marta going to get away with it? And what I love so much about this genre flip is because it takes the story forward in an entire new direction. This flip weaponizes the tropes of the murder mystery genre and they themselves are the antagonists. Now, at the end of every murder mystery, the detective always finds out who is the real killer, it's a trope and every murder mystery film has it. The detective gathers every suspect, has a monologue about the series of events and finally points out the real murderer. So now, we're even more interested as to how will Benoit Blanc (played beautifully by the Scottish Daniel Craig) will catch Marta.\n\nAnother reason as to why the twist works so well is because it makes perfect logical sense with the story and fits each and everyone's character. The twist lands so well in that sweet spot where it's damn near impossible to figure it out beforehand but extremely obvious in hindsight. This is done beautifully due to the order in which information is fed to us. One example is the dogs barking clue where it becomes obvious who is the killer but we've reached a point in the film that we don't care about it and simply ignore it.\n\nThe last reason why I love this film so much is because we get everything the film promised itself to be. We get a murder mystery plot resolved (which was thought to be dead at the end of the first act) along with another plot of genre flip which collapse with each other in a beautiful cathartic climax.\n\nThere is not better way to say this. Rian Johnson, You're The Man!",

Its 2-hour runtime flies in as the viewer is assaulted with twists, turns, and the unbelievable talent of all actors involved. Daniel Craig stands out as Southern PI Benoit Blanc and perfectly represents the eccentricity of the film but also the control, keeping it away from but never too far from becoming a caricature of itself.\n\nAn absolutely wonderful film that completely exceeded my expectations.\n\nFor the full review and more like it, visit my site: https://thephoenixprjct.com/knives-out-benoit-blanc-1-basic-review/",

The movie just didn't particularly make me care about the mystery or finding out whodunit, but the twist wasn't bad. Probably an unpopular opinion, but oh well.",

            "content": "Rian Johnson's \"Knives Out\" is an old-fashioned, smartly plotted and suspenseful murder mystery proving that people of color deserve a place in a genre where they are all-too-often denied opportunities to solve murder cases due toward their race. With his first whodunnit, Johnson revives interest in a bygone genre by celebrating minorities' lives without being wounded by razor-sharp knives. It's the filmmaker's first attempt to bring a bygone genre surging back to life using social commentary as sharp as the pointed edge of a knife, but he pulls it off expertly. Using stunning visuals, Johnson draws viewers into a private detective's expeditions to investigate the unfortunate murder of a patriarch belonging a wealthy estate. Evoking Robert Altman's \"Gosford Park\", Johnson expertly utilizes the confined mansion location to create tension amongst the suspects of a murder investigation whose motives are called into question. Like the wealthy socialites disturbed to discover their lives are in danger following murders in Gosford Park, the confined mansion showcases the bitter rivalries amongst the Thrombey family. Johnson showcases immense control over the production-design, editing and music, creating an unforgettable cinematic experience. Johnson's screenplay is superb, creating a compassionate depiction of a marginalized community through subverting the whodunnit genre's conventions. One appreciates fantastic performances. Daniel Craig delivers one of his greatest career performances as Benoit Blanc. With mesmerizing expressions, he captures the angst, intelligence and suspicions of a detective determined to solve a murder investigation involving a family experiencing dysfunction. Ana de Armas is amazing as a ferocious Latin-American housekeeper who takes a stand against privileged employers wrongfully accusing her of murder. Armas conveys the resilient humanity of a housemaid through her expressions rather than words. Finally, Chris Evans deserves appreciation. As a snobbish son that mocks his family, he brings comical relief to the movie. Although \"Knives Out\" is undeniably a gripping murder mystery, it isn't a film without flaws. It builds toward predictable conclusions that lack satisfying closure. One can easily guess the identity of the killer which takes the tensions out of this murder mystery. Nevertheless, fans of the murder mystery genre will definitely appreciate \"Knives Out\" and so will movie-goers seeking exhilarating entertainment. If Cinema is a political art-form with the power to bring about change that can be used by filmmakers to speak out on issues which they are passionate about without having bloody knives drawn out, hopefully it will provide modern-day immigrants facing a drought with a Clue how to go about fighting for their basic human rights in a worn-out country governed by racist politicians that have sowed a seed of doubt from which marginalized Latin-American communities have all-too-often been turned out.",

All-star cast has made it possible for me to enjoy every single minute of this whodunit except for maybe Daniel Craig who was trying a bit too hard at times to imitate the southern accent and his overall performance was in a way just another Hercule Poirot imitation but a fine one to say the least. In short Knives Out is a no time-waster for sure; it's almost exclusively a bottled movie shot within one location, with great soundtrack, solid characters, some witty dialogues, a bit too theatrical and hyperbolized narrative but entertaining and fun to watch nonetheless.",

But the most compelling is that absolutely everyone in Harlan's family is under suspicion and make it even more gripping! And actually the best thing about the film is the charming visual. Despite all the enigmatism of it, the visual component is very attractive and not chilling. So watch it, the plot isn't hackneyed, the cast is well chosen and it will definitely force your brain.",

He has a similar accent in the film 'Logan Lucky' if I remember right. \n\nThere are some intriguing plot twists, as we start to see more in terms of what happened from different characters perspectives/points of view.

Every single scene carries a purpose to the main plot: to set up a seemingly minor detail that will then play a role in the story, ergo pay off. Everything that we ever perceive here is relevant: whether that's Marta's genius-plot-device puking condition or Ransom not showing up to the funeral or even such a tiny thing as a fragment of Harlan's beginning monologue (\"Playing life like a game without consequence, until you can't tell the difference between a stage prop and a real knife.\"). Such writing is satisfying to both critics and the audience and naturally comes off as very smart storytelling, which, needless to say, Knives Out is.",

            "content": "Knives Out - How to do a Plot Twist\n\nI have never seen a better example of subverting expectations than in Rian Johnson's Knives Out. If you want to shock your audience and do it right rather than some cheap trick, then there is no better case study than this film. There are rarely other films like this that perform a plot twist so effortlessly.\n\nFirst of all, the plot twist we're talking about is Hugh Ransom Drysdale (played by the evil sweater wearing Chris Evans) being revealed as the true killer instead of Marta (played by Ana De Armas) which is believed to be the one almost throughout the entirety of the film.\n\nThe reason why Knives Out's plot twist works so well is because the film flips genres after a third of the way through. The entire first act is about it being a whodunit mystery; but, at the end of the first act, it exactly tells us what happened and who did it (in this case, Marta) and seemingly answers all our questions. All of a sudden, with the flip of a coin, it's no longer a whodunit; it's how the hell is Marta going to get away with it? And what I love so much about this genre flip is because it takes the story forward in an entire new direction. This flip weaponizes the tropes of the murder mystery genre and they themselves are the antagonists. Now, at the end of every murder mystery, the detective always finds out who is the real killer, it's a trope and every murder mystery film has it. The detective gathers every suspect, has a monologue about the series of events and finally points out the real murderer. So now, we're even more interested as to how will Benoit Blanc (played beautifully by the Scottish Daniel Craig) will catch Marta.\n\nAnother reason as to why the twist works so well is because it makes perfect logical sense with the story and fits each and everyone's character. The twist lands so well in that sweet spot where it's damn near impossible to figure it out beforehand but extremely obvious in hindsight. This is done beautifully due to the order in which information is fed to us. One example is the dogs barking clue where it becomes obvious who is the killer but we've reached a point in the film that we don't care about it and simply ignore it.\n\nThe last reason why I love this film so much is because we get everything the film promised itself to be. We get a murder mystery plot resolved (which was thought to be dead at the end of the first act) along with another plot of genre flip which collapse with each other in a beautiful cathartic climax.\nThere is not better way to say this. Rian Johnson, You're The Man!",

Whether you know who did it early on or are thoroughly suprised at the end, the sequence of events is enough to keep one entertained.  I would very much recommend this movie for adults and teens as there is minimal violence and gore, but not children due to some sexual references and language.

            "content": "It was very hard to say no to watching 'Knives Out' and it was one of my most anticipated films since it came out. It was due to being busy and personal problems that stopped me from seeing it sooner. A lot drew me in to watching it. Absolutely love murder mysteries and seeing a lot of comparisons to one of my favourite authors Agatha Christie and the starry cast were reasons enough for me to see it, as well as the great reviews.\n\nFound myself really enjoying, if not quite loving, 'Knives Out'. Can understand why it may not be for all, if one doesn't like seeing and hearing the truth much earlier on than they would expect, and it is easy to see the ridiculing for Daniel Craig's Southern accent (which is admittedly atrocious). Can totally understand its appeal and why it was so positively received though, because to me it was a well made, well acted and cleverly written film that shows that director Rian Johnson does have a great film in him. While not perfect or one of the best films ever made (though was not expecting 'The Godfather' or 'Casablanca' etc), it is a long way from being a 1/10 film, putting it down there with most of the films riffed on MST3K, films from SyFy and the Asylum, 'Home Alone 4', 'NeverEnding Story 3', 'Titanic: The Animated Movie' and the Baby Geniuses films is insulting. As far as 2019 goes, it is towards being one of the better films of that year if not one of the very best.\n\n'Knives Out' had potential to be even better than it was. If it didn't overdo or repeat too much the vomiting running gag and slowed the final solution down (a suitably complicated one that is explained a little too fast for my liking) it would have been a better film.\n\nWouldn't have said no to the truth (well some of it was) being revealed later than it was, though even when it was placed when it was it was still in the final solution not at all what things initially seemed. The film is a little overlong as well.\n\nHowever, so much works here. 'Knives Out' looks great, full of atmospheric colour, beautiful locations (the interiors of the house are especially atmospheric), stylishly photographed and slickly edited. Nathan Johnson's score has menace and energy, without feeling overused or over-scored. Johnson directs expertly with a clear love for the genre being sent up.\n\nIt is a cleverly scripted film too, shining especially in the smart and affectionate 70s murder mystery throwbacks and deliciously salty one liners and insults from Ransom. The story never felt dull to me and even when things seemed obvious too early some ingenious unexpected twists are brought in. Can totally see how Johnson was so influenced by Christie's writing, evidenced from as early on as the terrific opening sequence and with Christopher Plummer's patriarch character (a type of character seen frequently in Christie's books). A fine example of how to bring freshness to a very familiar genre often visited, while the final solution is incredibly clever though demands full attention.\n\nMoreover, the ensemble cast, one of the best from that year, clearly have a ball. There is some delicious deadpan but also some inspired but not overdone scenery-chewing. Accent aside, Craig does a great job breaking away from his Bond image and revels being comedic in a laconic way. Plummer (RIP) is perfectly cast and while his screen time is not large he makes the absolute most of it. Ana De Armas has one of the most difficult roles and shows no signs of being taxed. Jamie Lee Curtis, Toni Collette, Don Johnson and Michael Shannon all give it everything they've got. My favourite performance came from Evans, also breaking away from typecasting, he was never this witty or salty.\n\nOverall, very, very good. 8/10",

With a stellar cast that includes Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, Toni Collette, Christopher Plummer, and Daniel Craig as Detective Benoit Blanc (the lead of a soon to be film series), it's hard to imagine this film not being great. The set up is standard Agatha Christie with rich patriarch Plummer found dead and all of the family angling for his fortune being suspect. Although the set-up is standard, Johnson subverts murder mystery conventions, with the cause of death revealed early in the film, but best of all it's the audience who has all the facts and Daniel Craig's detective left in the dark. I don't want to spoil the story, but MINOR SPOILER ALTERT, much of the film's suspense boils down to the fate of a sympathetic protagonist. Overall, if you love a crackling good mystery or wonderful ensemble casts, don't miss this film. BONUS FILM SUGGESTION! If you enjoyed \"Knives Out\" you should check out Rain Johnson's first film as writer/director, \"Brick.\" It's another wildly fun murder mystery, though it's in the mold of Raymond Chandler with a high school Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a noirish teenage Phillip Marlow.",

In return, one forgets previous judgement and becomes captivated to the point of claiming said-film a \"masterpiece.\" This is exactly what Rian Johnson does in Knives Out.\n\nFrom a stacked and well-acted cast to the well-wrttien screenplay to the interesting film editing, Knives Out is wild ride that goes everywhere in the most organized way, never once falling into plot-holes. It leaves its audience on the edge of their seat, constantly making us change our theories of how the film will end, in this case, who is Harlan Thrombey's killer.\n\nA murder mystery that contains both an accidental and intentional murder. This is just one aspect in where the pure genius of the films lies.\n\nI do have to add another place in the film where the pure genius lies and it is in a place where films do not execute well. Johnson sneakily adds political commentary on serious issues happening in our country during the former president's term. There is nothing exhausting in adding activism but at times, it comes off forced and unnecessary. A combination of the acting and screenplay in this scene did the complete opposite. Their political commentary also added more insight in each character's personality and therefore, their development.\n\nThe film is simply so good on its own it makes us nervous for the sequel and trilogy to come but, in Rian Johnson we trust.",

Interesting Daniel Craigs and Chris Evans performance, which viewers aren't usually used to, which makes it even better. It was refreshing to see Chris Evans on the bad side finally.

I was reluctant to watch this movie because it was written and directed by Rian Johnson, who I thought did a horrific job of the installment of Star Wars he worked on.  However, I am so glad I did.  Redemption!.   The plot is clever but not the movie's strength.   The movie is thoughtfully put together and the characters are delicious.   Daniel Craig affirms that he is one of the most underrated actor of our times because he can play such a diversity of roles effectively.   He is terrific as the private investigator hired to solve Christopher Plummer's (who is delightful) murder.   Ana De Armas is captivating.   Chris Evans, Michael Shannon, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Don Johnson all have you longing for more back story.  The remainder of the cast are well played.    This one is over 2 hours but times flies by.

Knives Out was a movie I was really hyped for when I first saw the trailer. And considering I wasn't the biggest fan of The Last Jedi, I was holding out hope for Rian Johnson as I loved Brick and Looper. Knives Out is a return to form and then some. Devilishly fun and cunning, it puts a spin on murder mystery films, all the while making it more of a \"howdunnit\" than \"whoddunit.\" Daniel Craig is hilarious with his over the top kentucky accent and detective ways. Ana De Armas plays her role pretty nicely and delivers an innocence to her role. Chris Evans stands out as the obnoxious and rude family member, while Toni Collette provides a hilarious rich snob character. The rest of the star cast do an amazing job as well, with each character popping out on screen bringing strong screen presences and fun dialogue. A definite must watch!",

The film is fast paced and for 130 minutes, flies by fairly quickly (with the exception of about midway into the film, where 2-3 characters are then solely focused on). I found the film to drag a bit during this portion but then the third act makes up for it with the reveal.

The first 30 minutes of the film are used by writer-director Rian Johnson to develop the characters and lay the foundation of the plot.

The cinematography and directorial style are vaguely similar to the 1972 film classic 'Sleuth'.  While all is well and good in this movie, the strength lies in the excellent script.",

The fact that the movie focuses more on the characters and telling the story at a brisk pace than giving the viewers a Sherlock Holmes like puzzle that they may or may not solve really makes the movie enjoyable. The plot is not beholden to showing clues to the viewers, but it shows enough to tease the imagination and the audience can try and piece together the mystery, guess who to exonerate and to blame all the while enjoying the different actors' performances.

It is way better than Rian Johnson's Star Wars: The Last Jedi. Don't judge Rian because of that movie. The Star Wars series is a tremendous objective to hold. Rian tried his best. Dream on, Rian. \ud83d\ude4f ",

Dressed-up as a who-dun-it with a laudable and worthy cast, doubtless each of whom saw some facet of potential in the script.  There are bright moments where a flame is almost sustained.\n\nIn reaching for everything -- it grasps nothing.\nA terrific opportunity for most cast members to stretch and grow, to demonstrate new range and reach for the kind of roles previously filled by major talents recently lost to the ravages of time.\n\nUltimately it is grating to watch as the off camera talent was missing or massively divided in their conceptions which forced an ineffective compromise. \n\nRather like watching a 2019 'slice of life' of distant relatives of 'the Baudelaire orphans' as told by stoners -- lacking the individual magic of the stunning cast of that cult classic that so charmed and amazed in 2004.\n\nSo much potential lost between the fingers of incompetents. Reminds me of the parable told of the dog with the bone crossing a bridge who sees his reflection... and drops the bone into the water.\n\nSomeone needs to be sure that the Producer faction, the Director faction, and the Editor faction never work together again.\nIt just fails to gel -- can not even sustain an emulsion.\nIt was a struggle to finish watching this.",

An actor as British as they come, playing a character with the most French name I've ever heard, forced to put on a deeply southern US accent, what?\nand yeah, the person who did it deserves to go to jail, no moral confliction there, the way she accidentally kills him is so idiotic that she deserves to go to prison for sheer stupidity. All the medicine stuff has dropped to the floor, two very similar bottles (except for their names in massive bold texts) one bottle is supposed to be emptied into his veins, it's his medicine, the other bottle will kill him in 10 mins if injected, and she DOESN'T BOTHER TO CHECK WHICH ONE SHES PUMPING HIM WITH?!?!

I had heard amazing things about this since its release and, man, is the hype befitting. It's a brilliant 131 minutes, even if it feels much shorter than that given how enjoyable it is.\n\nThe casting is impeccable. Daniel Craig is superb in the role of Blanc, I've actually found Craig a tad hit-and-miss - even with 'James Bond' - but he is utterly superb here; even with that unusual yet definitely entertaining accent.\n\nIt's by no means The Craig Show, though. Ana de Armas is excellent as Marta, she does a lot of heavy lifting in terms of making her character's situation fully believable. She's great from start-to-finish.\n\nMichael Shannon is top notch too, I literally always find him fun to watch - from 'Boardwalk Empire' to, even, 'Kangaroo Jack'. Jamie Lee Curtis, Chris Evans, Don Johnson, Toni Collette, Lakeith Stanfield and Christopher Plummer are all fantastic too.\n\nThe plot is enthralling, it's crafted together expertly. It reveals bits way earlier than I was predicting, which made me worry it was going to all fall flat at any moment but it kept turning out to be the perfect time to twist the story. The comedy is also very funny, I laughed a fair amount.\n\nA joy to watch! I haven't got a bad word to say about 'Knives Out'.",

This film centers around the death of a wealthy man, and a detective who is hired by an unknown source to pinpoint who is responsible for the death. Johnson uses and engaging story line to demonstrate that those in power do not always deserve it, and to show how immigrants are treated and viewed in today's culture. Unlike other films within this same genre, Knives Out leaves the audience genuinely guessing and on the edge of their seat, unfolding a story line that at its core centers around the goodness of humankind. Johnson's other work, such as Star Wars: The Last Jedi, center around a plot that is dramatic and serious. However, Knives Out incorporates humor by overemphasizing the drama within the film. This film makes a social commentary about those in power and the nature of how people view and treat immigrant families. It paints the people who are wealthy and in power as selfish and concerned only about the money and wealth that they have. Furthermore, this film makes many upfront comments about immigrant families. Having much of the plot centered around a nurse whose parents are immigrants. This girl receives several comments that attack her family. Furthermore, there is an emphasis on how pure this girl is as opposed to the people in power. All in all I would give this film two thumbs up! Cleverly written, it keeps the audience entertained while relaying an important social commentary. By the utilization of the colorization of the characters clothing to relay their personality, as well as the music and soundtrack used in showing the characters to create particular moods. The use of cinematography add layers into the plot of the film, leading to a shocking resolution. Unlike other films within this archetype the hero of this story develops overtime, and may even be given to several different roles. All in all, Knives Out is a brilliant film with an important social commentary on immigration and those with wealth and power.",

The movie breaks the boredom in such a simple, easy, and clever way. \n\nThe whole cast is absolutely amazing, Ana De Armas, I was in shock by her acting and her facial expressions, she was able to put on that performance of the good/innocent nurse in a beautiful way. Chris Evans was absolutely incredible, he really impersonated a grimy and sleazy character and convinced all of us how filthy his character is that I think many of us when we look at Chris Evans all we see is \"Captain America\" but after watching this movie we will see the filthy \"Ransom Drysdale\". Finally, Daniel Craig's acting was incredible as well, his accent, the way he speaks, the way he moves around and all was just so genuinely incredible, and of course, the whole supporting cast as well was a great choice.\n\nThe script is so clever and the more you watch the movie, the more you'll discover some little details that will shock you, which makes Knives Out a unique film. The first hour of the film was so enjoyable, it'll make you just curious and want to know more but then the movie gets a bit boring in the second hour and to be specific after \"Harlan's Will Scene\", which makes sense because it was like a \"break\" for the audience especially that the first hour was filled with so many events but at the end, the movie got up again and shocked us with that great ending that I really loved and did not expect at all.\n\nThe great custom design that did fit each character so very well, Marta's (played by Ana De Armas) scarf and different costumes, Joni's (played by Toni Collette) beautiful dresses, Ransom's (played by Cris Evans) sweater or detective Benoit Blanc's (Played by Daniel Craig) different suits throughout the movie. \n\nThe production design that was just so very beautiful, and it's shocking that the movie did not get nominated for an Oscar for \"best production design\". \n\nThe music gave a movie a great little taste although I thought the movie was going to have a better soundtrack.\n\nKnives Out is a movie that you will enjoy so much and \"highly recommend\" everyone to see this masterpiece, one of the best murder/mystery and thriller movies ever\n\nMy rating is 9/10",

The next morning, Harlan's housekeeper Fran finds him dead, with his throat slit. The police believe it was suicide, but an anonymous party pays private eye Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) to investigate. Blanc learns that Harlan's relationships with his family were strained: he threatened to expose his son-in-law Richard (Don Johnson) for cheating on his wife, Harlan's daughter Linda (Jamie Lee Curtis); cut off his daughter-in-law Joni's (Toni Collette) allowance for stealing from him; fired his son Walt (Michael Shannon) from his publishing company; and had an altercation with his grandson Ransom (Chris Evans). Unbeknownst to Blanc, after the party, Harlan's nurse Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas) apparently administered him an overdose of morphine by accident instead of his usual medication and could not find the antidote, leaving Harlan minutes to live. Knowing that Marta's mother is an undocumented immigrant, Harlan prevented her from calling for help and instead gave her instructions to create a false alibi to save her family from scrutiny. Harlan then slit his own throat. Harlan's elderly mother saw Marta carrying out Harlan's instructions but mistook her for Ransom. Marta cannot lie without vomiting, so she gives true but incomplete answers when Blanc questions her. After agreeing to assist in Blanc's investigation, Marta conceals evidence of her actions as they search the property. Harlan's will is read: to everyone's astonishment, he left everything to Marta. Ransom helps her escape the family's wrath. Ransom coerces Marta into confessing to him and offers his help in exchange for a share of the inheritance. The other Thrombeys try to persuade Marta to renounce the inheritance; Walt threatens to expose her mother's immigration status. Marta receives an anonymous blackmail note with a partial photocopy of Harlan's toxicology report. She and Ransom drive to the medical examiner's office, but the building has been destroyed by arson. Marta receives an anonymous email proposing a rendezvous with the blackmailer. Blanc and the police spot Marta and Ransom, and after a brief car chase, Ransom is arrested; Blanc explains that Harlan's mother saw Ransom climbing down from Harlan's room the night he died...\n\nRotten Tomatoes website's critics' consensus reads: \"Knives Out sharpens old murder-mystery tropes with a keenly assembled suspense outing that makes brilliant use of writer-director Rian Johnson's stellar ensemble.\" David Rooney, writing for The Hollywood Reporter, described the film as an \"ingeniously plotted, tremendously entertaining and deviously irreverent crowd-pleaser\" and \"a treat from start to finish,\" praising the film's script, the throwbacks to the murder mysteries of the 1970s, and the actors' performances. Dana Stevens of Slate wrote \"Knives Out knows exactly what kind of movie it is: a sendup of twisty murder mysteries with all-star ensemble casts that also loves and respects that silly tradition.\" For The A.V. Club, A. A. Dowd called the film \"madly entertaining\" and \"an ingenious sleight-of-hand crowdpleaser\". David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film an A\u2212, writing \"Johnson has devised a murder-mystery that's eager to defy your expectations, but unwilling to betray your trust. The film may be more smart than stylish, and it may opt for a reasonable outcome over an overwhelmingly shocking one, but Knives Out doesn't let the element of surprise ruin a good story.\" David Sims of The Atlantic wrote that Johnson \"turned the whodunit on its head\". Dani di Placido of Forbes wrote that Johnson \"finds a way to revitalise the concept\" and \"makes murder mystery great again\".\n\nHonestly, I don\u00b4t understand the raving reviews of Rian Johnson's \"Knives Out\". The film received critical acclaim, particularly for its screenplay, direction, and acting, and grossed $309.2 million worldwide against a $40 million budget. At the 77th Golden Globe Awards, the film received three nominations in the Musical or Comedy category: Best Motion Picture, Best Actor for Craig, and Best Actress for de Armas. It also received Best Original Screenplay nominations at the 73rd British Academy Film Awards and 92nd Academy Awards. It was also selected by the American Film Institute and the National Board of Review as one of the top ten films of 2019. To me this is just another not particularly original whodunnit murder mystery with a nod and a wink to Agatha Christie. Nothing more, nothing less. Despite the fact that the film has a great ensemble, but that doesn\u00b4t help. Not in my book at least.",

Some nice surprises in this from some people we haven't seen in a while, like Don Johnson and M. Emmet Walsh.  The storytelling and quality of directing stand out evenly alongside this stellar cast.  It's a story of greed, sibling rivalry, and a nice dose of detective drama.  I want more films like this, from this or any director of this genre.

            "content": "Knives Out is American director Rian Johnson's fifth feature film. This self-authored mystery is suspenseful, absorbing, and uproariously funny. Though I didn't recognize the director's name before now, I've since discovered that Johnson is a rising star with a reputation for innovative script writing and direction (Star Wars Ep 8: The Last Jedi, Looper, Brick). In addition to movies, he has also taken on some television work, most notably directing three episodes of the acclaimed series Breaking Bad for which he won a Director's Guild of America Award in 2012. \n     First and foremost, Knives Out is a classic whodunit movie, and bears all its hallmarks. It takes place mostly in one location, the palatial home of best-selling mystery novelist and murder victim Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer). Several of Harlan's progeny, including in-laws and grandchildren, have plausible motives to commit murder. However, the death on which the movie centers, appears to be a straightforward suicide, and is treated as such by the police. That is, until the sharp sleuthing powers of private investigator Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig), begin to uncover another story. \n     Of the many delights this film offers, one of the best is the offbeat casting. The ensemble of top-notch actors, spanning many eras, genres, and media seem to be having a great time playing roles that are, for the most part atypical for them. Daniel Craig, for instance, best known as the seventh James Bond, here plays investigator Benoit quite credibly with all the mannerisms of a Southern Gentleman including, as one character puts it, \"that Kentucky Fried Foghorn Leghorn drawl.\" Don Johnson of Miami Vice fame, is entertaining as the philandering son-in-law Richard, husband to Jamie Lee Curtis' severe and sardonic Linda. Chris Evans, erstwhile Captain America, plays the couple's entitled and malicious son. But the movie belongs to Ana de Armas who plays Marta Cabrera, the sympathetic nurse to Thrombey. Cast into this maelstrom of unexpected events and incriminating clues, she needs to summon her wits to try to stay one step ahead of the investigation. Cabrera is, by turns, vulnerable, funny, resourceful and strong. \n     I can go on about the sparkling dialogue, enjoyable acting, and clever plotting but THE ONE THING that radiates from this film for me is the accomplished, cinematic storytelling which is achieved largely through precise, layered editing. Johnson has collaborated with editor Bob Ducsay on his last three films and they obviously have developed a very effective, efficient and smooth method of narration. For instance, shortly after the film begins there is a 16-minute interrogation scene in which we meet all the principals and hear their take on the events on the night of the murder. Not only does Johnson deliver exposition but he exposes a rich tapestry of scandals, lies, insecurities and attitudes. It's achieved largely through the richly nuanced script but also through rapid cutting from present to past and back. Sometimes one character speaks to the investigator. Blanc replies with a reasonable question. Then that question is answered by another character who is unexpectedly now sitting in the interrogation chair. One would expect this to be jarring, but it is pulled off so seamlessly that all the narratives are blended into one intelligible, detailed and entertaining story of the Thrombey family. \n     My favourite scene occurs when Marta and another character collaborate to cover-up an unfortunate accident. Marta is given detailed instructions on what she must do to extricate herself from blame, and as she receives this information, we see her performing the steps. But this is not merely a voiced over scene. Marta has trouble recalling some of the instructions clearly, and the voice over now garbles the instructions too, to reflect her confused state. She even talks out loud to the voice over, and the character responds. Then the scene cuts to the investigator completing a coin flip in the air, letting the audience know that all of this detailed recollection happened in the space of time needed to flip a coin. This brilliant blurring of memory, subjectivity, suspense, and time is typical of the style and pacing of this extraordinary film. \n     Knives Out is an exhilarating film made by a director at the peak of his powers, and delivered by a radiant ensemble of actors old and new. The formidable gifts of Johnson and his crew are pressed into the service of providing audiences with a brain tingling experience that never stops being fresh and fun to watch.",

This film is still pretty new, so I'm not going to spoil the ending, but about halfway through it takes a lovely turn from a typical whodunit to a cat-and-mouse, but with many more twists to come. The cast is star-studded, with Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon \u2014 who I would watch do anything \u2014 and Daniel Craig, whose accent is just ridiculous enough to be believable; his baseball throw, however, belies his southern drawl. Toni Colette, Lakeith Stanfield \u2014 who I swear is in every movie I watch nowadays \u2014 Don Johnson, and Ana de Armas, who I wouldn't say steals the show, but is the nicest surprise, are just a few more to add. As you can see, there's a lot to unpack here in terms of characters, so I'm not going to bother with names, but basically a rich crime novelist is dead with a slashed throat, a famous PI is hired, anonymously, and it (mostly) takes place in a gorgeous Victorian home with the coolest study I've ever seen. The film is also a snapshot of the times, with terms like \"Alt-Right Nazi, Lifestyle Guru, et al.\" being used amongst the characters. The best running gag was how each character said de Armas was from a different country \u2014 Paraguay, Uruguay, Ecuador, Brazil. Of course, have to mention that circular knife centerpiece that is never directly addressed, but plays a larger role than just general badassery. Maybe I'm just a big dumb dumby, but why couldn't the detectives just ask de Armas if she committed the murder? I'd go into more detail, but said earlier about no spoilers. Comment if you know the answer. Knives Out delivers exactly as it should, which is sometimes all I want in a movie. Pairs great for a date night and red wine.",

Not only does Rian Johnson do a great job with directing this movie, but an even better job writing it.\n\nHowever, the movie mistakenly goes against the murder-mystery formula. We're given too much information too early, which makes the last half of the movie less interesting. The point of a murder-mystery is to play \"detective\", analyze the characters and see if you can figure out whodunnit, but this was spoiled for us too early. Even still, this was a clever, well thought out movie with great characters and a fun storyline.\n\nMovie in Summary: Good\n\nRecommended for: Fans of murder-mysteries, fans of Rian Johnson subverting your expectations, or fans of Captain America telling you to eat sh**.",

As I mentioned earlier, Rian Johnson deserves a lot of credit for tackling a film that has the narrative that a murder mystery involves. We've rarely seen a murder mystery film in recent with as much quality and style that \u2018Knives Out' shows so well done to Rian. The ensemble cast undoubtedly shine through as virtually all cast members play their part very well. Yes, some parts may have appeared predictable but all in all, \u2018Knives Out' was a great watch, especially one to watch with the family or friends!\n\nQuote \u2013 \"I suspect foul play\" \u2013 Benoit Blanc\n\nScore \u2013 8/10",

Most reviews here by audiences are NOT considered in overall RT audience ratings because our ticket purchase hasn't been verified via Fandango and other sources.  I still like to read any audience review if trying to decide if I want to see a movie.  I skip most critic reviews except Rex Reed-he's been around a LONG TIME and has probably seen more films than any other critic. Just my  2 cents: If not printed on RT, then I'll never be back, as I think audience reviewers need to understand this issue. Bottom line: if you don't prove you saw a film, your review doesn't count, but critics don't have to prove they saw a film. \nREVIEW OF FILM: \"What were the words heard by the Nazi [listener] masturbating in the bathroom?\" is screenwriter/director Rian Johnson's funniest line, and the answer resolves much of this beautifully done murder mystery.  Daniel Craig delivers that line (as Detective Benoit Blanc) with a nicely rendered southern America accent (great job by vocal coach Diego Daniel Pardo). But Craig keeps thickening his accent, much to the entertainment of admiring cop Noah Segan, but not so much to Segan's cop partner, LaKieth Stanfield. During the final 'big reveal', these three plus the final suspect along  with the great Ana De Armas give us a masterpiece of acting. Add the magnificent Jamie Lee Curtis, Toni Collette, Christopher Plummer, plus others, and you have THE great film ensemble cast of the year. Not to mention the very creepy Jaeden Martell. Set Decorator David Schlesinger creates a fun/creepy house, Special Effects Supervisor Judson Bell keeps any special effects unnoticeable, a superior effort for me as I don't like effects drawing attention to themselves and taking me out of the film/story.  Rian Johnson comments in the extras that his main focus was making a movie, and oh does he succeed. This is entertainment of the highest order, and easily my favorite film of 2019. And how could you not laugh out loud at Craig delivering another great line: \"You [the final suspect] and Harlan [the murdered Plummer] were drama mamas,\" ironically delivered by Craig has he reaches a crescendo of his Southern 'act'  which is the center of the film, and may have been indeed another layer of the mystery. I watched this twice in a row (the second time with comments) and there'll be a third watch soon. This isn't just a murder mystery, it's a movie masterpiece. And yes, that's the Rolling Stones' performance over the end credits with a great score recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London. If you think movies aren't as good as they used to be, you're gonna be in for a great surprise. I hope, soon, to see a movie poster/DVD cover with the words, \"Another Rian Johnson WHODUNIT.\" Dame Agatha Christie is praising Rian Johnson from the literary heavens, surely.",

Christopher Plummer plays an old mystery novelist, whose death is being investigated by Daniel Craig's Detective Benoit Blanc. Craig steals the show every time he is on screen. Craig's southern accent is very convincing and his whole performance is memorable. Relative Hollywood newcomer, Ana de Armas, is the lead in this film and although she is surrounded by veterened actors, she definitely does falter and gives a great performance. The supporting cast of Jamie Lee Curtis, Chris Evans, Michael Shannon, Toni Collette, and LaKeith Stanfield round out one of the best ensemble casts outside of the MCU. The story is gravitating. It is about Blanc being mysteriously summoned to investigate the \"suicide\" of Plummer's Harlan Thrombey. There are several moving pieces in the story and every character seems to have a motivation for killing Harlan, but also for not wanting to kill him. The conclusion seems a bit more predictable as the film progresses, which is a bit of a let down. I was able to predict fairly early on what the end would be, but it is still such a fun ride that it makes it okay. The cinematography is fantastic. Bright colors and engaging scenery make this feel like a Clue game come to life. The dialogue is sharp and really all of the characters are interesting and fairly fleshed out. This is not the absolute best movie out there, but it is well-made, acted, and written to warrant it's high praise. Overall, I give this movie an 8.5/10.",

Instead of everyone is innocent until proven guilty, everyone is presented as a guilty (as a suspect, at least from an audience stand point), and we have to piece together the clues as we're drip-feed information.\n\nAnd as the movie continues, it reminds you where you might not have been paying attention, rehashes events in the logical manner that is required, in case you hadn't followed, to prove the case (again, baring semblance to \"Clue\"), and every detail and every minute of the movie is intriguing.\n\nI'm looking forward to the 2nd watch to see if the re-watchability holds up.",

Within the first minutes of the movie, the interviews  help you figure out who killed Harlan Thrombey, (which in a successful movie is a no-no). \n\nThe Games of Thrones-like throne is another feature that shows Johnson's arrogance. While you can tell that he loves mystery and film noir, his mis-use of cinematography through-out, (in a failed attempt to \"highlight\" clues), is probably a tribute to old school mystery writers and the famous genre director Hickcock, is a part of this arrogance; Johnson has a myopic belief in his skills. His flat script reminds me of his other movies that are clearly his cinematic monument to his ego. Which even they are a veiled attempt to hide the fear he must face, having failed early in his career, that he will never truly write his \"great work\", direct his \"great epic\" nor acheive his place in history as a significant contributor to the movie industry itself.\n\nThis is over rated.

            "content": "Knives Out had Rian Johnson's hand all over it! He directed, produced, and wrote the film, just coming off of Star Wars: The Last Jedi, that was pretty controversial, but bounced back very well with a definitive mystery classic. Not only did he create one of the best mysterys to come to the big screen, but he was able to incorporate all of the enjoyable genres like crime, drama, thriller, & comedy. Johnson painted these beautiful frames, adding so much depth to his shots. With shooting in detail, rather than in film, it added a lot of depth to every scene, while utilizing the natural light that was provided.\n\nRian Johnson did a phenomenal job modernizing the murder mystery/who did it tale, and really making it his own. The screenplay was coherent & fresh, being so witty, sharp & hilarious. He created this crystal clear narrative, backed up with so much wit, and style, it made you overlook all the simplicities. The few subplots this film had, it added amazing layers & depth, while it all intertwined with the big picture so well, enhancing this great mystery tale. The tone switch ups this film had was incredible! The tone switched up every half hour or so, keeping us on our toes, but explaining everything in depth, while keeping it as entertaining as possible.\n\nMary Vernieu casted easily the best cast of 2019 so far. Knives Out was chock-full of A-list actors like Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis & more! Everyone knew their place, and played their roles the best they could've. Christopher Plummer put on such a mature & witty performance, arguably being one of the funniest of the group. Daniel Craig was one of my favorite castings for this movie. His performance was very witty, and clever, mixed with great tongue & cheek jokes. Craig may not have been the main protagonist we follow, but he is most certainly one of the best performers in this movie! Ana de Armas was our sweet \"innocent\" main protagonist. We follow her for most of the film, and my god, does she put on a GREAT performance! Chris Evans has been more focused on playing a cool headed, heroic character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but here he puts on a devious, sarcastically funny, yet charming & persuasive character. We got a little taste of him in the first act, but not as much as the other supporting characters. Evans becomes more present in the second and third act, adding a different flare to this unique family. Rian Johnson created great tention with all of the characters, throwing in nifty twists, keeping everyone involved, and relevant.\n\n\nThe art directors & production designers in David Crank & David Celestenger created this beautiful, old time mansion. The way Rian Johnson executed the mansion was fantastic, making everything feel free, yet claustrophobic, while rising the stakes.\n\nOverall, I can easily say this is my favorite mystery movie, even over Sherlock Holmes; Highly recommended.",

The good? An all-star ensemble cast of A-list Hollywood actors headlines this piece, and with exception to Jamie Lee Curtis (whose last acceptable performance was in True Lies), they all play rather well the part of the cartoonish characters that this film needs in the setting it constructs. And wow, the house in which most of the film takes place beautifully illustrates the ugliness, dysfunctionality, and schizophrenic nature of the family at the heart of the story, so when the film is setting itself in the beginning, the camera allows the audience to see strange statues, odd architectural structures, and rather mundane items all right next to each other. The bad? The movie lasts an hour too long; the \"truth\" is revealed less than halfway through and all of the wind is taken out of its sails, but Rian Johnson keeps dragging the movie along to force the audience to see that \"No, that's not really what happened\" to showcase his faux cleverness as Daniel Craig plays the detective that conveniently figures everything out in record time. The injection of pop politics (i.e. lines like \"They're putting. Children. In cages.\", \"Anchor baby.\", \"Your mom is still undocumented\", multiple usages of the phrase \"the help\") took me out of what was occurring in the film, making me think of real-life events but not the movie while realizing that that'll inhibit its shelf life when people watch it 10+ years from now. Lastly, Ana de Armas' allergic reaction (\"if I even think about telling a lie I start to throw up\") takes an intentionally absurd plot and blasts it into ridiculousness when she begins lying by omission early in the movie yet doesn't vomit. By the end of this, I was more than ready for it to be over as I had long since grown tired of its American Beauty level of pretentiousness. If you want a better film with similar tone and tenor, go watch Clue, and if you want to watch a mystery that takes its material more seriously yet has lots of twists and turns, I strongly suggest watching the first two seasons of Broadchurch, but avoid this movie if possible.",

The stellar ensemble cast feels somewhat wasted with most of the film being focused on newcomer Ana de Armas and her great performance as Marta Cabrera, the innocent immigrant nurse with a golden heart, and the pintoresque detective Benoit Blanc, charmingly portraid by Daniel Craig.

I kept waiting for a big twist to flip 'Knives Out' morally on its head, but the characters, while flamboyant, are kept disappointingly one-dimensional. Everyone who is first introduced as good remain good and those presented as rotten remain rotten. I equate this movie to 'La La Land' in the sense that many people gave it credit/longed for it to be something that it wasn't quite - possibly because of its overt political message. The promise of the star-studded ensemble is suggested early on, yet never fulfilled since an unanticipated side character becomes the protagonist. 'Knives Out' plays it straight when I was expecting something much twistier and darker. I had sky-high hopes for this and, while it still passably amuses and showcases some of Johnson's skill, 'Knives' is a much splashier, broader mystery than his bewitching debut, 'Brick'.",

While his large family of dysfunctional narcissists grieves over the loss of their father, their selfish anxiety seethes in anticipation for the unveiling of his will.

But we know him as a #JAMES BOND 007 in INDIA in my opinion..HaHaha...! because of his some sperhit moveis like Casino Royal,Skyfall, Spectre...and many more. His perfomace is just amazing, his acting is oustanding. Now come to our next character Chris Evans as Hugh Ransom Drysdale whom we know as #CAPTAIN AMERICA. I am also a big fan of both actor. So See them in one movie is also a best ting for me. There are many more actor whose acting is also just unremarkable. Na now finally come to the director and writer of the movie - Rian Johnson, i didn't' seen his past movies. But by this movie i'll definitely try his upcoming movie. So from my opinion ill give this movie 10/10. So guys just go and see this movie during this # lockdown and give more and more stars to get IMDB ratings 10/10 because i this it deserves 10. I skipped this movie because I thought there is so much drama and i don't like drama much, but this is just incredible I regret why I am so late to see this movie.

A spectacularly clever play of words that came out in the last act just made me want to die with laughter. As a \"who done it\" movie, I felt like early on I knew exactly who the culprit was, despite the efforts the movie tried to make to throw me off, but I was racking my head a million times trying to conceive how the suspect could've done the crime even though the movie explained it very early on who was mainly responsible. And yet my expectations were subverted beautifully. And as to the cast, Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, and Ana de Armas were just perfect. They deserve every bit of praise the y got.

Nice to see Chris Evans play against type as well...or is he? The only problem? The advertising because you know Hollywood wanting to hide the fact that Ana de Armas a.k.a. the girlfriend from Blade Runner 2049 is the protagonist, not the Thrombeys or detective Benoit Blanc. But since that seems to have been an intentional move when you watch the movie, it doesn't really qualify as an actual criticism. That, and the fact that I can't talk about more without risking spoilers. So, go watch it and learn why \"Ruin Johnson\" is a dead meme!",

Very stylized and bright with a new twist on the \u201cMystery Mansion\u201d genre, it was satisfying to watch and fun to see the clues come together. The cast is a dream, Craig has created as quirky and odd a detective as Poirot or Marple but with more of a sense of reality. Really a beautiful film to watch and a very odd script to match.

I also knew the vials were switched and there was no murder as soon as that scene played out, I was alerted by the antics of \"pretending there was an earthquake\", knocking over the board and the shot of the vials falling. (And why did harlon have a chemo port installed for a daily injection for a hurt shoulder?)  I knew it was a \"who done it\" that wanted a twist desperately and I knew that meant Harlon was alive or it was actually a suicide. Also, if Harlon was willing to slit his own throat to save the nurses mother and sister from deportation, and he had already given her his entire estate-it seems odd he wouldn't have just hired an attorney for $4000 a while ago to make her family legal. Especially since he was very sharp still and managed his own finances and those of his entire family. (Also morphine hits the Brain 3 seconds after it's injected at 30 times the dosage! Lol) I also knew Chris Evans was guilty as he was hardly in the first half of the movie and a star of his caliber wouldn't take the role if he weren't pivotal and had a big scene at the end. And Daniels accent was KFC. Watching shenanigans for two hours knowing the vials were switched and there had to be no murder ...waiting for captain americas big moment for his pay check was not over the top fun. I mean...she runs an Errand to get the medicine bag back With the detective in the car? And what she's gonna do? - just carry it out and throw it in the trunk with him in the front seat? And also...as soon as she over dosed harlon I said well, the tox report will show it was an overdose so why are they doing all this other shit. Anyway... 97% of people enjoyed it so good for all of them! For me and my husband, since I told him every thing that would happen, a bit of eye rolling. But I LOVED that house!!! What a great location!!! Oh...and What was with the Game of throws set piece?!...I knew that spot was in for a big finish and I also knew that fake knife gag would come back as it was also kind of clunky dialogue that stood out in the death scene. So I saw it all coming. Admittedly,  I do watch a lot of murder mysteries and so I see \"the gun in the first act\" and this does have good eye candy and enough complexity to hide the big structural flaws...and again people seem to love it.

I felt as though several interesting characters were created, but under-used.

By subverting the narrative, Rian has created a piece of work that will stand the test of time and engages its audience to question everything that's presented to them. \n\nIt boasts an excellent cast with Daniel Craig and Ana De Armas at the centre of it. Being a big fan of Daniel as James Bond, it was interesting (and thrilling) to see him in a different role. I will say his accent takes some getting used to if you're familiar with his original accent. However, that dissipates as the movie goes on. Ana gives a performance that'll push her into more main roles.\n\nChris Evans is delightful as the \"black sheep of the family\". For someone who has played a morally sound boy scout for nearly a decade, it's refreshing to see him be someone who swears and doesn't give a hoot about what people think of him.\n\nIf you've yet to see, Knives Out, you're missing out. Whether you enjoyed Rian Johnson's previous film is a totally different kettle of fish as Knives Out is an original piece that shows how talented he is as a Director and a writer.",

Esse filme me faz sentir sortudo por ser um apreciador da S\u00e9tima arte!\n\nSabendo disso, fica claro que o fato de ser escrito e dirigido pela mesma pessoa faz uma grande diferen\u00e7a. N\u00f3s sabemos que seremos surpreendidos, e a dire\u00e7\u00e3o faz isso de proposito para que ponhamos nossa cabe\u00e7a para funcionar. Mas nada \u00e9 entregue de bandeja aqui, n\u00e3o at\u00e9 o gran finale. O filme apresenta todos os personagens para que comecemos a nos basear desde o principio. Mostrando as discuss\u00f5es pendentes e com quem o velho tinha mais afinidade. Obvio que determinados aspectos s\u00e3o revelados de acordo com que a trama segue, e devo dizer que o timing foi excelente, visto que voc\u00ea n\u00e3o se sente cansado em nenhum momento do filme. Cada cena \u00e9 importante e nada \u00e9 atoa - guardem bem isso.\n\nDaniel Craig estava excelente nesse filme. Talvez essa tenha sido sua atua\u00e7\u00e3o mais divertida, pra mim. O papel dele n\u00e3o \u00e9 f\u00e1cil, pois entrela\u00e7ar o misterioso, o divertido, o espertalh\u00e3o e ainda dar corda para o filme acontecer - sem ele, n\u00e3o haveria sequer caso - \u00e9 um peso e tanto. J\u00e1 Chris Evans usa de todo seu charme para construir um personagem arrogante e pretensioso. Ana de Armas convence muito no seu papel, passando drama nos momentos corretos e seguindo sua linha de base at\u00e9 o final do filme, o que mostra muita aten\u00e7\u00e3o por parte dela. \n\nEntre Facas e Segredos \u00e9 um prato cheio, principalmente para quem gosta do g\u00eanero. Surpreende, intriga, ati\u00e7a, e tem um final extremamente satisfat\u00f3rio.\n\nNota 9!",

It is obvious that Rian Johnson has proofread his script a million times, and although it is airtight, its subversions are wholly unnecessary. Unlike TLJ, twists are seen as essential in a film of the \"Whodunnit\" genre, so Johnson's habit is excusable. But now that he has the excuse of a mystery film, it seems he has turned the proverbial dial to 11 and has gone all out with his twists. These happen so often that I found myself disappointed and flattened by the films climax. To add to the irritation, there is the obligatory underlying immigration message which directors feel obliged to put in their work for it to have a deeper meaning. But when this cannot be interwoven with the film's own plot and theme, and instead is just happening at the same time, it loses all reason to be in that film in the first place. Despite this, the film certainly has its merits. Everyone fills their roles well, the characters as a whole are well written and the movie has an attention to detail which is commendable. Johnson has certainly come up with a stellar idea for a film, and its intrigue is certainly still alive, but some restraint was desperately needed. But from the start I knew this would be an easy crowd pleaser. A needed career booster, if anything, for Johnson. And who am I to critique him for that?",

Some of the characters are extraneous and, to be honest, I think the cast was just good at playing these characters because it's exactly how they would behave if a illegal housemaid stole their fathers inheritance.\n\nThis movie feels like a half-hearted remake of the 1980's version of Clue and tries to hard at being quirky when it just isn't; a house full of quirky souvenirs doesn't quirky make. Lastly, the script just doesn't hold up for mystery fans. At the end I was left asking myself \"there's a twist here, right?\"\n\nThere is no twist.\n\nDespite all of that, you can tell that they really tried to make a fun movie. \n\nAlso, it's always good to see Don Johnson working.",

The film has a strong cast, and a storyline that's quite simple in nature, but that's the fun and nothing is never what it seems. I was expecting something overhyped and pointless, but this is incredible. Rian Johnson is playing at the top of his field and it's refreshing to find a filmmaker attempting new things.

            "content": "In the Whodunit drama, detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) has to uncover who killed famous author Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer).\n\nActing: 10\nI can't speak enough about the amazing performances that made this movie come alive. I honestly don't know where to start or who had the best chops because they were all so wonderful. Jamie Lee Curtis has always been one of my favorite actresses and her role didn't disappoint here. She's Linda Robinson who serves as somewhat of a matriarch in the family. She delivers her lines with such perfect timing and such fluid grace that it's hard not to love her character. I also appreciated Jaeden Martell's role in the movie. I can only imagine how hard it is as the youngest cast member when you have all these heavy-hitting stars beside you, but he definitely held his own by putting on a performance here that was even better than his role in It, in my opinion.\n\nBeginning: 10\nYou are immediately thrown into this story from jump like you are springboarding into the sky. The intrigue is immediate which gave me an instant feeling that I was going to like this movie. It's a perfect setup for what is to come.\n\nCharacters: 10\nNothing short of spectacular. Again, where do I start? I love that every single one of these characters in the movie have a rich story that's connected to the deceased. There is also some kind of growth (whether negative or positive) with each character which is hard to juggle when you're talking about managing runtime as well as screentime. I could pinpoint one specific role, but I loved each and every single one of them. That's not a very common thing to say.\n\nCinematography/Visuals: 10 \nDirector Rian Johnson really hits home on the visuals with an interesting blend of vivid colors and bleak imagery. I have a great appreciation with how the movie was ultimately cut. It's a film that doesn't rush, but takes its time, really capturing special dramatic moments. It almost feels like a Wes Anderson meets Stephen King type of cinematic adventure.\n\nConflict: 10\n\nEntertainment Value: 10\nFrom shock value to mystery, Knives Out keeps you on your toes start to finish. It's funny, it's smart, and, most importantly, it's original. This kind of movie has been done dozens of times before and this one is, by far, the most unique of the bunch. It truly is in a class of its own.\n\nMemorability: 10\n\nPace: 9\nWith a 130-minute runtime, it's only natural that there would be a slip-up in pace here and there. Fortunately, the slowdowns are very brief and barely noticeable. I can only think of one or two moments where I thought, \"They could've cut that.\" The momentum is pretty incredible otherwise.\n\nPlot: 10\n\nResolution: 10\nEnds strongly, yet smoothly with a finite resolution. I found it funny that the ending was actually a subtle knife into the hearts of the antagonists. The conclusion is a beautiful whisper.\n\nOverall: 99\nKnives Out is hilarious yet touching at the same time. With an original storyline, consistent pace, and brilliant characters the movie succeeds on just about every level. It was both refreshing and unexpected to watch a movie this grand.",

Rian Johnson - writing and directing - fashions a claustrophobic and clever movie, consciously nodding at Mankiewicz' Sleuth and Lumet's Murder on the Orient Express while having fun too at the expense of mobile phones, VHS cassettes and even - in Daniel Craig's marvellous Southern detective - Stephen Sondheim.",

I was VERY aware i am watching a movie. I had to stop to write this review. \n\nWhat else? The non buildup of characters towards the initial death( which the whole plot revolves around), so we have almost no depth of each person other than the 20 second interviews for questioning. Basically we are told an old guy dies and then family gets questioned... thats your opening story for the first 30 minutes, barely any backdrop.\n\nIf you think this is a good movie, god help you. 95% audience review kind of shows rotten tomatoes is being reviewed differently than a few years ago. I think mainly because most normal people have stopped watching hollywood movies. I tried to watch this movie for FREE online and had to stop just to complain how over rated it is. This is the epidemy of why people dont go to see movies anymore. \n\nOn a side note, Ford vs. Ferrari was actually decently good though... this was, however, utter excrement of a bloated cast and crap script writing \"who dun it\" garbage mystery and made me write this review after 30 minutes of watching.",

            "content": "A delightful spin on the whodunit genre!\n\nRian Johnson's murder mystery comedy Knives Out (2019) is a fantastic bit of intense suspense and silly nonsense to entertain you for 131 minutes of pure joy. Knives Out is easily Johnson's best film to date as his writing is intricately detailed with fun foreshadowing of major plot points as he allows the audience to guess alongside the detective. It's like a neat interactive viewing experience wherein the mystery is part of the fun as Johnson delivers clue after clue to help cross off suspects and glue pieces together to culminate in a blissfully complex narrative. Knives Out's murder mystery is unpredictable and subversive in the best kind of way: refreshing. Johnson's script uses contemporary references and upbeat pacing to keep you engaged with the dialogue, so that you remember every detail due to his delightful phrasing.\n\nJohnson's direction is similarly astute. Rian Johnson finds the heart and motivation for each of his quirky characters and lets scenes breathe in a refined and classy like his previous films have not reached this caliber of filmmaking. Rian Johnson establishes himself as an auteur with his own voice, style, and vocabulary for modern audiences with the outstanding picture Knives Out. I highly recommend Knives Out, if only to witness Johnson come into his own as a director of original content and playful knowledge. He uses intimate spaces in production designers David Crank and Jeremy Woodward's mansion set with efficient cleverness. You are always wondering what lies underneath each clue setting up for another twist.\n\nBob Ducsay's editing is phenomenal for Knives Out. Each moment sweeps you away with a shocking cut utilizing image matching and verbal cues to transition you to another fun moment. Ducsay has a flourish and flair to his editing that keeps Knives Out tight and fast. The 131 minutes feels like 30 to me. Steve Yedlin's cinematography is fascinating and fun too. His framing is so clearly focused in to characters, reactions, and feelings as he captures countless clues in the backgrounds and tiny hidden figures all over Knives Out. The camera work keeps people in beautiful shots and unique poses, so that you are misdirected and led on a curious path deeper into Knives Out's mystery.\n\nNathan Johnson's score is playful as he teases you with cute musical cues to clues throughout Knives Out. His music is pretty, but how he contributes to the mystique and humor of Knives Out is his real accomplishment. Jenny Eagan's costumes are wonderful with Ana de Armas and Chris Evans donning instantly iconic cable-knit sweaters. Meanwhile, every other character gets adorned with colorful dresses and stylish suits. I just love the look of Knives Out as everything looks comfy and warm for such a cold mystery movie. Luisa Abel did a wondrous job putting make-up on Ana de Armas making her up to be even cuter.\n\nSpeaking of Ana de Armas, she absolutely steals the show in Knives Out as the lead actress playing a sweet nurse named Marta Cabrera. Armas leads the fray as Knives Out's leading lady with heartfelt compassion, emotional openness, paranoia panic, and gentle grace. She expresses such a wide range of emotions in Knives Out that I was sincerely impressed by one of her greatest roles. Knives Out is all the more fun with the inclusion of her cute persona Marta. Ana de Armas has been astonishing me for a few years now after she genuinely acted her heart out in Hands of Stone and Blade Runner 2049 alike. After Knives Out, I am all the more intrigued by this gorgeous and talented young actress portraying Marilyn Monroe in Blonde next. She is a force to be reckoned with now.\n\nRian Johnson pulled out all the stops to stuff Knives Out with a killer cast of all star actors. Including Ana de Armas, Daniel Craig also leads Knives Out as the stern and silly Souther detective Benoit Blanc in one of his funniest roles. His accent alone is consistent and hilarious, but it's Craig's brilliant comedic timing that keeps you laughing. He effortlessly allows himself to be both the genius sleuth akin to Sherlock Holmes or Hercule Poirot as well as the foolish detective like a deep fried detective all his own. Likewise, Chris Evans is pitch perfect as the almighty asshole Hugh Ransom Drysdale. His smug smirks and cozy cable-knit sweater clad entitled rich jerk is delirious fun as he insults the entire world of arrogant wealth surrounding him that he's also apart of in reality. Knives Out is one of Daniel Craig and Chris Evans' best roles, honestly.\n\nJamie Lee Curtis is neat and fierce as the very direct and particular Linda Drysdale. Don Johnson kills it as the cheating husband of Curtis named Richard Drysdale. I was surprised just how much I enjoyed Johnson's demanding conservative character. Michael Shannon is outrageous as the fearsome, manipulative Walt Thrombey. Shannon can play it kind and attentive, then suddenly switch to naive and curious, then vicious and underhanded in an instant. I liked Jaeden Martell as Shannon's Neo-Nazi, alt-right teenager Jacob Thromboy.\n\nFurthermore, Toni Collette remains one of the greatest actresses of all time as the adorable shallow and self-serving Joni Thrombey. Katherine Langford is excellent and convincing as the sincere stoner feminist and simultaneously selfish rich girl Meg Thrombey. Her portrayal is really a nice touch of depth for several character arcs here.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned actors, Lakeith Stanfield continues his career dominance as the fun and skeptical Police Lieutenant Elliott. Christopher Plummer is still iconic as a calculating mystery novelist and intellectual millionaire Harlan Thrombey. His playful chemistry with Ana de Armas is a highlight for me from Knives Out for sure.\n\nRiki Lindhome has a cameo as the passively racist conservative Donna Thrombey. Edi Patterson gives a good performance as someone going out of consciousness. Fozzi Bear himself, Frank Oz, himself cameos as the will reader Alan Stevens in a very funny scene. Lastly, K Callan stars as Christopher Plummer's mother Greatnana Wanetta in a neat little role that has dire consequences. Her absent minded role delivers several huge laughs and a few sweet moments alike.\n\nIn short, Rian Johnson's Knives Out is a stellar feature film with an inventive script, innovative editing, focused direction, and an unreal cast. I hope viewers give Johnson's greatest film a chance.",

It's like they wanted to get Kevin Spacey and his Frank Underwood Gullah low country drawl, but decided at the last minute to get another actor following Spacey's scandals.\n\nThe interview scenes seemed to have lasted an hour, though possibly 20 minutes in real time, without changing the setting of the plot (minus the flashback scenes). It was a very long section of the movie and it felt like the story wasn't going anywhere.\n\nFinally, the amount of deus ex machina given to Daniel Craig's character was absolutely absurd. He somehow figured out the entire murder-suicide in painstaking detail without first revealing this to the audience, so it seemed he conjured up the resolution of the story out of thin air.\n\nI'm glad the movie ended shortly afterwards.",

It was incredible. The characters were amazing, from the victim to the suspects.\n\nCan we take off the hat before the only and talented Daniel Craig?

The whole movie's mistery revolved around giving a big pay-off and it delivered, because the story was clearly written with an end in mind.\n\nSpoilers for both Knives Out, and all Star Wars Sequel Trilogy movies (7-9):\n*I do agree with the message of Knives Out, which shares strong themes with Rian Johnson's Star Wars 8: The Last Jedi. This message is that your identity and merits as person, should be defined by your own actions. If the best way to define yourself is by the merits of your ancestors, then you are evaluating yourself wrong. \n\nYour biological family means nothing towards who you develop yourself as a person, and shouldn't automatically make you heir to anything, if you don't deserve it. In a way this film brings the closure to Star Wars 8: The Last Jedi themes in that it carried on the conclusion. The JJ Abrams' written and related, Star Wars 7: The Force Awakens and Star Wars 9: Rise of Skywalker don't have themes of their own; and basically try to justify their merits on being tangentially related to the George Lucas' Star Wars movies (the end of Rey saying: \"I'm Rey Skywalker\" is basically Rey saying all my merits hinge on me knowing this more successful person). Worse is that to give that completely wrong and pro-nepotism message, the good Rian Johnson's message was retconed away. That message is that you are worth something regardless of coming from nothing; in both instances.\n\nKnives Out as a criticism of both JJ Abrams' films and all the whole expanding movie franchises shared universes (like comic originated MCU and DC); trying to justify their merits and whole existence by being tangentially related to other movies without nothing of worth to say on their own.",

            "content": "Knives out is advertised as a whodunit movie. In a way it sort of is but this is Rian Johnson, he loves subverting expectations. Seriously though, this movie really subverts a lot of expectations. It's better to go into this movie with little to no knowledge which is why it is difficult to review this without giving away too much.\n\nFirst off, this movie has an amazing cast with Daniel Craig pulling off an American accent as the private investigator. Chris Evans post Avengers work has him play a much more terrible character which is a huge contrast to Captain America. Christopher Plummer while a minor role gives a very lovable mystery novelist. Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson and Toni Colette give a very convincing performance as egotistic rich snobs. Ana de Armas must be praised as well for being able to convincing give the audience a sort of POV character in this massive all star cast. I will also give props to Lakeith Stanfield, Katherine Langford, Jaeden Martell and Noah Segan as well as they did a great job as well. The story and the screenplay is just phenomenal with the witty and charming dialogue. Likewise, the twist are smart and really keep the audience on its toes.\n\nI do struggle to find negatives but I guess the one and only true blatant negative is the very obvious political message. \"Right white conservative\" are bad. The movie doesn't emphasise it a lot but there are scenes where is delves into these such as immigration and having the white rich characters talk quite negatively about it. Likewise emphasising how the children of Christopher Plummer's character have not earned anything of their own legitimately or have been given massive money to earn anything. It's a very simple and obvious message that anyone can see throughout the entire film. Additionally, maybe the misleading advertisement can be quite a deterrent to some viewers. As stated at the beginning, Rian Johnson completely flips the Whodunit genre on its head but the trailers and advertisement suggest it is just a typical whodunit story when it really isn't. To me this isn't exactly a negative but it could be seen as such to other viewers. \n\nIn conclusion, this is a must watch to everyone. It is such an entertaining movie and is a great reminded of films from the old Hitchcock days. While the director's previous work, The Last Jedi, was divisive; This movie is amazing. Give it a watch!",

In a mistery film, you are certain that the person they are looking for would be revelead at the end of the film, but this one doesn't follow this rules. \nPlus, it makes you think that everything is already resolved, but the viewer knows there's something behind it, but unless you're a true detective, you won't fin out until they tell you. \nAgain, I really enyojed. It wasn't the best movie ever, nor the best mistery film, but it was surprisingly good.

There is simply so much that makes this film great in my eyes, from the amazing acting from the cast, to the screenplay, to even the little details that come back into play perfectly through the story, I was left guessing until the very end, and even better I was left in stitches by the surprisingly funny writing and dialog. This film was a pleasant and truly great surprise of 2019, If there are any imperfections, they are minor, and I had didn't even notice any if at all while watching this film. Knives Out is a magnificent ride and one that I highly recommend viewing, a true must see of 2019, I give Knives Out an outstanding 10/10!",

I expected to find Craig's character grating but I actually found him fun (in a ridiculous way). I especially appreciated the production design and general direction\u2013the house was a formidable setting for this story and Johnson is one of my favorite directors right now. I am happy to be able to watch and enjoy original scripts, especially those that offer a reflection on our current political/cultural dynamics. I think this story is hailed as more astute than it actually is\u2013I saw a great take on Twitter about this, that while a film like Parasite offers an upending of the structure that oppresses poor and working-class people, the story in Knives Out doesn't ultimately threaten the system\u2013the unsavory players are just replaced by more virtuous ones. Heard there's a sequel coming\u2013if that's the case, I hope Johnson continues to follow this thread and deepen his reflection. I'll definitely pay to watch it.",

There was nothing flashy, but the capture of faces is something that really stood out in this movie. When the detectives lean in, they get to close to the lens it feels so tense and that they are looking into your soul.

Christopher Plummer is also great and has great chemistry with  Ana De Armas who is actually really good and i really liked her character. The other characters i didn't really like and just couldn't invest in them. The sound track and cinematography is so well done, i couldn't get enough of both. The real downfall of this movie is just the story. They reveal a piece of information before the end of the first Act and it just made me disengaged from the movie. I see what director Rian Johnson was going for but it just made bored of the movie and i didn't really cared to see the ending of the film as it was sorta predictable. I see why everyone may like this movie but for me it left me disappointed. Although watching this movie a second time, you see clues and little Easter eggs that made it interesting to find. Overall Knives Out is just a decent movies that relies on everything but the story to make it good",

The jokes were funny and subtle, but there were long segments that didn't make any attempt to be funny. Towards the middle of the film, I was getting more invested in the drama element of this comedy. It felt like it was constantly bringing up new plot lines then throwing them away. Finally, it has a classic \"massive plot twist at the end\" that barely makes sense and relies on information we didn't have.  On the plus side, they keep a very consistent mood, and the film seems very high quality. The characters are mostly likeable in their own way. This was a fun movie to watch.

            "content": "\"That certainly not what I was expecting.\"\n\n- Whodunit?\n- Rian Johnson.\n- Why?\n- To subvert the tropes of yet another sub-genre... properly!\n\nAs divisive as it was, I neither loved nor hated the love-it-or-hate-it The Last Jedi. Maybe because I'm not a huge fan of the much-beloved saga. But I can give you a quick opinion of what I thought about it anyway. The first half almost turned me off completely: tons of lame jokes and out-of-character moments that indicate that Johnson's biggest concern was to subvert expectations and nothing but. The second half of the film was way better. It proved to me that Johnson is actually very capable of adding fresh blood to the saga, so effortlessly to such an extent that I wondered why he struggled so much in the first half.\n\nIn Knives Out, Johnson didn't add a new spin on the 'whodunit' sub-genre of detective fiction; he took it and turned it on its head. He did so not only by playing with the tropes and mechanisms of this sub-genre -and boy, he did that so exquisitely and gracefully- but he also by using a new and very effective building block: Drama. It doesn't sound new, isn't it? But, actually, relying on it here, in this kind of a story, is nothing short of revolutionary, and that's simply lies in the fact it's unprecedented to build upon it here. The result is nothing but marvellous. And although that, at some point, the main concern of the plot wasn't the murder mystery per se, the mystery didn't lose its sharpness even a tiny bit. And that's a strong proof that everything worked, and integrated, seamlessly. I said integrated because the film has a plethora of comedic bits throughout its runtime -which flies by- and, to be honest, I think every single joke landed perfectly. The film also suggest a political agenda that's exquisitely woven into the plot, and provides a sharp social commentary that's impressively subtle.\n\nNot only did Rian Johnson reinvigorate this seemingly outmoded and unfruitful sub-genre, but he also did the same thing with a couple of members of the star-studded cast: I didn't know that Chris Evans, Captain America himself, would be better as, well, an \"Anti-Captain America \"; Craig as Blanc is absolutely phenomenal, with his southern accent and caricature detective character; and Jaeden Martell (IT) is very interesting as the weirdo Jacob Thrombey. As for Curtis, Langford, Plummer, Collette and Shannon, Johnson makes an excellent use of their incredible acting abilities, and of their facial expressions and features, especially Shannon with his remarkable menacing countenance. The real standout, though, is Ana de Armas. I mean, she was good in Blade Runner 2049, but here, as she plays my new favourite version of Pinocchio, she proves she's an exceptionally talented actress who is capable of expressing emotions, and changing them readily, only with her eyes. Honestly, I think she should have been nominated for an Oscar!\n\nOverall, I'm really surprised how much I loved this film. With Johnson superb and clever direction and meticulously-nuanced and witty -albeit slightly too-structured- screenplay, I think this is my favourite - even if it's not my highest-rated - film of 2019. You know what, this film is actually terrible: it's very pretentious; its puzzle is too convoluted for its own good; it has an overabundance of plot twists; it underutilized its stellar ensemble; and it has a lot of plot holes, or -in this case- donut holes! Excuse me, I gotta leave right now!\n\n(9.5/10)",

            "content": "Rian Johnson subverted sci-fi fantasy with (arguably) the best star wars film in The Last Jedi, pulling no punches for his love of the genre and material but not without forward-thinking ambition, and now he's returned to the mystery genre to do the same with the sharply-written and playful Knives Out. Johnson clearly loves the genre and he fills his mystery box, a stunningly crafted Massachusetts Cluedo mansion, with all the tricks of the trade and some of his own making. The result is murder mystery throwback to Agatha Christie that comes screaming into the present with modern insecurities and viper-tongued social commentary. It's a blast.\n\nThe easiest way to grab an audience's attention is to kill someone and Johnson does precisely this is the opening minute of his clever film, having poor maid Fran (Edi Patterson) stumble upon centrepiece of the conflict Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer), a successful crime writer himself, with the unfortunate affliction of having his throat cut. The film then unfolds in a sort of documentary style at first with each family member interviewed by two detectives, their names revealed by title cards, their testimonies full of red herrings. This is done against the backdrop of an extravagant, wildly impractical display of knives \u2013 and so the game is afoot.\n\nThe detectives believe it's a routine, albeit unconventional suicide. But there's another mystery in the room, sitting at the back in the corner, shrouded in darkness, the elusive, eccentric Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig), an old-school detective whose presence is a mystery unto itself. He doesn't know who hired him. Craig is funny and brilliant as the oddball investigator, equipped with a played-up southern drawl that has him nick-named CSI-KFC \u2013 and so begins the barrage of self-referential humour that trickles throughout the script like expertly placed breadcrumbs. It's a delight to see Daniel Craig freed from his bond shackles and disappear into a role \u2013 and loving every minute of it.\n\nThe rest of the cast don't disappoint either, each of them overplaying their hyper-realised characters. Michael Shannon is Harlan's eldest son Walt, playing a sensitive, sniffling publisher to his father's lifetime works, and is understandably miffed when daddy decides to cut him loose in one of the most passively aggressive shutdowns you're likely to see. His wife is the rather quirky Joni played by Toni Colette who joins the rest in being well cast because she always has that side-eyed look of somebody that's a little wild and unhinged \u2013 perfect for a murder mystery. Black sheep of the family is Ransom, Chris Evans playing against type as an arrogant brat, swapping his Captain American costume for warm knitwear. Jamie Lee Curtis is excellent as eldest daughter Linda, given quotable lines that see her poke fun at the media frenzy that is twitter. Her husband, Richard (Don Johnson) is a trump supporting sleazeball, his scenes often made to cast commentary on the racial divide happening in America, particularly when contrasted with MVP of the film Marta Cabrera (Ana De Armas), a South-American \"friend\" of the family and nurse to Harlan Thormby. I very much enjoyed the political undercurrent of Knives Out as it gives the film a welcome bite and the excellent script is likely to reward multiple viewings and an attentive gaze.\n\nIt's good to see Armas getting the leading role and attention her talent deserves and she delivers in spades here. Her character is at the centre of the mystery that unfolds, and with the waspish commentary of class division that's trickled throughout and brought to a perfectly realised boiling point in the fantastic final shot, her presence is a tricky yet helpful thorn in Blanc's side as he uncovers the nefarious deeds that surround Harlan's death. A death that provides a neat table flip halfway through the film and forces the audience to reconsider the central mystery in a new light. And this is where I think Knives Out shines brightest as a murder mystery because it becomes clear towards the end that Johnson is less concerned with the surprise shock of a final twist and more interested in the best way to execute the unravelling of his tangled web of mystery. This is what makes Knives Out such a refreshing sweet, it is not simply a case of trying to guess who the murderer is because Johnson's hand is craftier than that, and he manages to stay a step ahead of the audience all the way. It's the sign of a great writer and once again he has surprised and re-shifted a genre that was too easy to predict. Bring on the next instalment that sees Blanc sniffing through Cornwall, investigating death by pastie asphyxiation or something. I don't care, I just want another one.",

The climatic big reveal cannot be predicted, even if you have followed clues like an unmatched detective. So, what makes the latest whodunnit scenario \"Knives Out\" anymore significantly worthwhile? Well, it is no mystery when attracted by the cast and what sort of wit they would twist, bury and unveil upon themselves and deflecting upon others.\n\nThis modern-day murder mystery finds renowned mystery writer Harlan Thrombey privately dead at his estate just after his 85th birthday, and mysteriously enlisted Detective Benoit Blanc investigates Harlan's dysfunctional family and devoted staff only to find their own covers as one of them is red enough to see through. Or is it? We have a caretaking nurse, a housekeeper, an eldest daughter running real estate with her husband's support, a youngest son running the publishing company with his wife and alt-right bratty son's supports, a widowed influential daughter-in-law caring her daughter's study, a spoiled and hated playboy grandson, and an elderly-disoriented mother. Whodunnit, and why exactly?\n\nObviously despite the circumstance, \"Knives Out\" is fun to be engrossed by as a freshest take on the genre. The excellent cast made the story attractive, and the result shows how they had delved into their characters producing convincing family dynamics as the main characterized portion. Meanwhile the more nonfamilial upfronted serves as the story's plot-stirring and the most conflicting side. Daniel Craig's performance perfected the given role with slick charisma, right next to his singled-out co-star of the bunch Ana de Armas in her more apparent breakthrough performance. Even dead, Christopher Plummer's character still looms in the mind, therefore providing recognizable grizzled gravitas.\n\nThe star players played out the whole whodunnit mystery scene very nicely because they were impeccably directed. Rian Johnson seems to find better storytelling fitting when on his own whereas cinematic independent aesthetic is more accepted rather than pressured to take for an intellectual property \u2013 although his work for \"The Last Jedi\" greatly integrated his authorship stemmed from independent filmmaking, much to the displeasure of many moviegoers who only attend visually-exciting blockbusters. While his previous mystery throws back to the classics amid constant buildup, he actually went and reveal what really happen while the plot still thickens during and after. What makes it a freshest take is how the unexpected culprit's conflicting morality between honesty and loyalty whilst leaving the detective to keep pondering as diversion. Johnson more this time proves how crafty he can stretch from visual cues for distant narrative fun to genius characterization preparing for the still-yet-to-be-unveiled twists \u2013 with little political talk being ever accurate.\n\nIn terms of originality, \"Knives Out\" is a perfect sendoff for the year 2019, and to an extent of the decade's mainstream cinema, into the new decade by being ingeniously entertaining with an excellent cast sweepingly refreshing a classic genre structure that maintains intrigued engagement. Outside a franchise, this is Johnson's best and declared auteurism of defining his [clear] way of storytelling. But he has made potential as well sparks interest to follow a detective's further crime-solving embarkment. (A-)",

I didn't really care for any of the characters and I didn't really root for any of them one way or another. I don't really sympathize with entitled, wealthy, pompous, gold diggers but I don't hate them either. As a result I ended up uninterested in what was going on. I didn't find many of the several \"who dunit\" plot elements particularly surprising or creative. I was really disappointed in the maid vomiting whenever she lied.

However it is Daniel Craig as private detective Benoit Blanc that charms every second on screen and Ana de Armas as caretaker Marta Cabrera that carries the emotional weight of the film. Its 2 hour and 10 minute running time feels much quicker thanks to the many twists, turns and hilariously witty dialogue written by the films director Rian Johnson that keeps your undivided attention.

Ana de Armas has a key role, not shown in the trailers, and the film seems nestled half way between a retro Agatha Christie and a really really good modern TV series. It's nice to see a low-fi, subtle picture that allows its characters and dialogue and self knowledge if its genre to delight instead of effects and whizzbang. \n\nI have to say I bumped it down half a star (or maybe even a full star) because Haymarket's Odeon is horrendous, the screen tiny, dark and cloudy, the audio tinny and plonked all over the place. It's a shame that bad projection can tarnish an experience but it did. However I'm really really looking forward to watching it again at home and that counts for something in this one-and-done age of viewing films. \n\nThe film is enjoyable and dark and funny and fresh. It's not astounding, but it plays very cleverly within its genre and with its audience but it never lambasts or lampoons them, it says something important about privilege and entitlement but doesn't cram it down your throat. \n\nDaniel Craig is excellent, clearly he's sick of playing damaged, dour, anti-role models and is acting up a storm and we're all loving it too. It's not a smug film, it's lovingly cheap feeling and tangible, and it's got some genuine standout callbacks and moments in it that will be remembered in film annals for a long time. \n\nA compliment in many ways to TV's Succession, a timely and exceedingly welcome joyride.",

            "content": "Witness for the Prosecution (1957) was the perfect example of a witty, whip smart adaptation of a murder mystery that featured hilarious performances and writing that knew just how far to push the innuendo. This film drops the courtroom drama element of that film but as a group of colorful, funny characters slowly reveal their backstories and have charming exchanges you can't help but smile. Seeing that there is a place for this film in the modern box office landscape was heartening as it proves that there is still a hunger for films that focus more on writing and performances than quick gratification and this film deserves the Academy Award nomination it received.\n\nHarlan Thrombey, Christopher Plummer, is a rich novelists who writes murder mysteries but he is murdered when he invites members of his family to his estate for the weekend. Renowned detective Benoit Blanc, Daniel Craig, is brought to the estate to investigate the case and begins to question every person who was present at the time of the murder. Of particular interest to him is Thrombey's son-in-law Richie, Don Johnson, whose multiple infidelities were exposed causing him great embarrassment in the process. His ideas about the case are confounded when nurse Marta Cabrera, Ana de Armas, is left all of Thrombey's money and assets in his will and the family turns on her. Hugh \"Ransom\" Drysdale, Chris Evans, is mistaken for Cabrera by one his family members, who dislike him for being a womanizer, so he arranges to pin all blame on Cabrera. She is awkward when interrogated by Thrombey which further arouses his suspicions and her attempts to conceal evidence are often unsuccessful. Blanc deduces what the most scheming member of Thrombey's family had done at the last moment and clears Cabrera of any guilt which allows her to continue living her life in Thrombey's mansion.\n\nWhat was most surprising to me was that de Armas, who I have been underwhelmed by in the past, gives a capable and likable performance in the central role. She is asked to carry most of the emotional weight of the film and as she tearfully apologizes as Thrombey dies or gazes at her mother from afar you become sympathetic to her. She handles the comedic elements of her role with aplomb but her talent is really grounding the film in reality when surrounded by performers who are playing it very broad. Of course there is a wonder to seeing Toni Collette play a spoilt, new agey woman who gets too drunk at a party and starts dancing in front of a tight lipped Jamie Lee Curtis but at some point the film needs to be more than just celebrities having fun. Blanc is possibly the least interesting character in the film but that worked for me as films like Murder on the Orient Express (2017) place too much emphasis on the detective and not enough on the wacky suspects.\n\nThe film does manage to make you hate the members of the Thrombey family while still laughing at them as they are such spoilt, entitled brats that it is hard to appreciate their redeeming qualities. We initially think that Ransom, who is enigmatic and all knowing, may be less awful than his family members but the twist, which most audience members probably saw coming a mile away, allows us to understand that they are all equally toxic. Rian Johnson really twists the knife when the family members turn on Cabrera, of whom they had been supportive up until that point, and it is then that we see how patronizing they are. Many murder mysteries deal with class and while not as perceptive as Gosford Park (2001) this film wrings a few more laughs out of it's jokes about the entitled wealthy.\n\nDespite this I think the film runs a little too long and Johnson could have cut out a few scenes of the Thrombey family simply being obnoxious or removed some of the characters. This may just be me but I also found the gag about Cabrera vomiting when she lies gross and not particularly funny and I wish he hadn't placed it in the film so often. These are minor complaints but the brought the film down a little bit for me.",

            "content": "'Knives Out' (2019)\nThis is a very solid murder/mystery. I recall seeing the trailers and promotions for this film and was very excited due to its star-studded cast. Everyone in the film does a great job and the script is very well-written. I will say however that I believe much of the talent in this film was unfortunately under-utilized, in my opinion. While avoiding spoilers of course, we get some good screen-time with each individual character early on in the film, although during the latter half of the film it really ends up revolving around only a few certain characters. Speaking of the latter half of the film, it goes in a direction that I just felt very mixed on. As I said, no spoilers, but it does not go your traditional 'murder-mystery' route at all, and to many that may be refreshing, and Rian Johnson now has a track-record for \"subverting expectations\", although I just feel very uncertain about the decisions with the screenplay. Daniel Craig and Chris Evans are certainly my favorite parts of the film, whenever they were on screen I was captivated. As far as technical aspects go, it is very well shot, the editing is seamless and the pacing is structured nicely. There isn't much else I can really say without delving into even slight spoilers, but overall it's a film I wouldn't mind seeing again, despite some of the gripes I may have with the plot-points and the route that the film ends up taking early on. I'd recommend it, and who knows, perhaps upon further viewings my favorability of this film may change for the better, although as of now this is how I feel.\n\nMy Rating - 7/10",

            "content": "Rian Johnson has jumped genres throughout his career \u2014 the noir Brick, the comedy of The Brothers Bloom, the science fiction of Looper, the big blockbuster that was Star Wars: the Last Jedi and now Knives Out. He also helmed an episode of Breaking Bad that won him a directing Emmy.\n\nSince 2005, Johnson has had this Agatha Christie-influenced film in mind. He also cited films like Deathtrap and Clue as cultural touchstones for this movie.\n\nSo what's it all about? Well, crime novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is found dead \u2014 a suicide \u2014 at his estate the day after his 85th birthday. Detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) has been hired by an unnamed party to investigate the crime. From Harlan's dysfunctional family to his devoted staff, Blanc sifts through a web of red herrings and self-serving lies to uncover the truth behind Harlan's untimely death.\n\nFirst things first: my attention span has been ruined by a steady diet of grindhouse movies, Hong Kong cinema and the works of Italian gorehounds. A movie over two hours long is quite intimidating to me, but I did my best to stick with it.\n\nSo the good things: Daniel Craig is absolutely having the time of his life playing private detective Benoit Blanc and every scene with him is a joy to watch. I really enjoyed the twists and turns of the plot, as well as the detection flashbacks, which brought to mind the original Murder on the Orient Express. And it's always great to see Plummer in a movie, as he was, after all the emperor of the galaxy in Starcrash. Yes, that's my cultural callback for this venerated actor.\n\nThis movie is a chance for Chris Evans to break out of the superhero mold he's found himself in. And Ana de Armas \u2014 who is also in the Eli Roth film Knock Knock \u2014 is great as Marta Cabrera, the nurse who finds herself inheriting the estate of the murdered writer who is the patriarch of this family of liars and thieves at the heart of this story.\n\nHey \u2014 there's M. Emmet Walsh, filling in for Ricky Jay who died during production. And Riki Lindhome from Garfunkle and Oates and the remake of The Last House on the Left (and also Under the Silver Lake). Plus, it's cool to see Frank Oz in his first onscreen role since, well, Blues Brothers 2000.\n\nBut man \u2014 there are so many characters here that have little or no time to shine. Jamie Lee Curtis is basically playing a cameo role and you could say the same thing for Toni Colette, Michael Shannon and Don Johnson.\n\nWhen we reached the one hour point, my wife asked me, \"How much longer does this have?\" I told her that we weren't even halfway done yet and she replied, \"What else do they have to tell us?\"\n\nI liked the film more than her. Despite reading reviews filled with hyperbole saying things about how this movie has reinvented the murder mystery and turned it on its head, I thought it was a pleasant enough diversion. It's not going to replace Agatha Christie movies for me, but for an audience that has probably never seen the films like Sleuth and Gosford Park that Johnson is inspired by, it's certainly a revelation for them.\n\nYour mileage, as I always say, may vary.",

            "content": "Rian Johnson writes and directs this wickedly pointy ensemble murder mystery, which finds a large, snobby family at odds over the untimely demise of their allegedly-beloved patriarch and the impending redistribution of his wealth.\n\nThe first hour is a particularly brilliant bit of deceptive filmmaking, shifting from one unreliably-narrated flashback to the next, while the audience is left to make sense of all the lies and half-truths. Eccentric to the last, each member of this extended family has something to hide, a personal scandal or ulterior motive, and that's conveniently left out of their fond memories with the deceased. Though it's burdened with such a heavy cast, none feel extraneous or fade into the woodwork. They're each distinct and memorable, even if a few of the actors take things a bit over the top and flirt with parody. Daniel Craig might be the loudest such example, constantly over-playing his best Foghorn Leghorn accent, but he's got plenty of competition. Like a high-expense party game, most everybody has a gimmick. Some just work it a bit harder than the others.\n\nWhen it's on-point, Knives Out delights in toying with perception and reality, sharing the same events from multiple, highly biased, perspectives. It falters on the home stretch, though, dropping the cloak and dagger in favor of a rather blunt, linear final act. That's disappointing, but not crippling. Even with the limp climax, this is a quirky, amusing, well-composed mystery. Just seemed like it was on the fast-track to something more.",

It has a lot of clever twists and red herrings. The cast is one of the best of the year, with Ana de Armas with a great performance. But the real standout of the cast is Daniel Craig. His performance is funny and has some real great moments. His accent is very good, especially since he's British. Chris Evans, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, and Jaime Lee Curtis also do some standout work as the family members. Of course, Christopher Plummer is great as family patriarch Harlan. The plot is very well thought out and plays out at a brisk pace that never feels to fast or slow. It builds momentum very well and the payoff is incredibly satisfying. This is definitely a must see and a great return to form for Rian Johnson.",

Also, credit for both the film's cinematography and production design as well. This film even has a great balance of old school/new school mystery film elements.

            "content": "Perhaps the greatest surprise that KNIVES OUT has to offer is that Ana de Armas is pretty much the lead role despite the plethora of marketing material that barely mentioned her presence whilst the movie's main sociopolitical merit badge was a pro-immigration agenda. I guess you have to sneak stuff like that in when you've got the family Thanksgiving weekend on lockdown for your opening week and still want everybody's conservative uncle to buy a ticket. Seeing as the film centers around a squabbling family populated with disparate political views, there is no arguing over the genius timing of the release. It's just unfortunate that since the movie forsakes the central murder mystery for a character-driven examination of capitalism's corrosive effects on the civic core of America, its commentary doesn't have much conviction to it. Since the promised \"murder mystery\" is all but solved by the end of the first act, for the rest of the run time you get what director Rian Johnson is best at (for worse or better): Subverting Expectations\u2122.\n\nI would hazard to say that Johnson should stick to this tier of filmmaking after wizzing most of the good faith Disney had with the Star Wars fandom down his leg. This is probably the best network television movie money could buy. Almost the entire cast is recognizable, and they say their lines like they're getting paid to do it. Aside from some edgy content it is mostly family friendly. It has about as substantive a critique of American politics as any given episode of \"Saturday Night Live\". And it's long enough that Meemaw can get in a nice nap before Captain America gets corn chowdered in the face. For fans of \"Murder She Wrote\" and \"Matlock\", I'm sure it's a thrilling two and a half hours because it's a distended episode of one of those series with Daniel Craig as Hercule Poirot by way of Foghorn Leghorn.\n\nUp until now you might have thought that this was negative review of KNIVES OUT. Yet I actually thought that the movie was completely acceptable. In fact, it might be the okayest movie I've seen in literally weeks. I chortled several times because some of the dialogue and plot were clever. And even though it was too long, it wasn't as boring or cheesy as FORD V FERRARI. But let's be real here, KNIVES OUT hardly needs my tepid praise to ensure that everybody and their aptly named son \"Ransom\" will be at a screening near you. Suffice it to say, you shouldn't count me amongst the many people lobbing wads of gelatinous accolades upon KNIVES OUT.",

Or maybe Murder She Wrote, which actually is referenced in this film! Is director Rain Johnson admitting the joke is on us, the audience? With no suspense. No surprises. Bad jokes and terrible acting, I'm just dumbfounded how this made-for-tv-esque film got 95% from critics and 97% from audience on Rotten Tomato's. Did we see the same film they did? A case where the previews far exceed the film. I almost walked out after thirty minutes. But decided to stay thinking this dog of a movie would stand up and bark eventually. Well...we stepped in it.

Simply masterful. I thought that I had the direction of the plot figured out multiple times, but then each time everything got turned upside down, in very logical ways. The acting performances were great. Knives Out is a simply fantastic film overall. I am most certainly disappointed that the movie got snubbed for Best Picture and Best Director in particular at this year's Academy Awards, especially when you consider that Joker got nominations in its place. As much as I found Joker entertaining, and Phoenix's performance to be memorable in Todd Phillip's work...it is simply not Academy-worthy as an overall film. Phoenix should get a nod for Actor, but the movie I found to be slightly above average. Knives Out, on the other hand, is most certainly Academy-worthy as an overall work. Here's to hoping that, in the very least, Rian Johnson takes home the award for Best Original Screenplay (the one award it WAS nominated for).",

This is a more or less a garden variety whodunit taking place in a gothic like mansion with a cast of \"names\" that the accountants thought would guarantee box office returns. Well, it worked.  We paid our money and took our chances.  The critics must all have drunk at the Agatha Christie Murder on the Orient Express fountain or were seeking favour, paying off a debt, scared of being out of step, etc.   Daniel Craig with a laughable southern accent set the tone. The rest of the \"names\"  were more caricatures than characters.  (Yes, yes, Christopher Plummer raises the bar simply by his very presence. )  Others, I.e. Jamie Lee Curtis, left me praying that there would be a comedy somewhere, anywhere, afoot.  Nope.  Suicide, barf, blood, and masturbation.  If you must go, (oh, but it's Plummer!) don't take the kids.  Better yet, wait till it comes out as movie of the week.  No, no, no. 3 stars - mostly because of Plummer.",

Johnson's tale also serves as a critique of modern American politics and humorously skewers characters left and right while highlighting a central cleavage in our current political environment.\n\nWe are living in a golden age of mystery/suspense and KNIVES OUT is yet another example of how great mystery storytelling is today.",

There are much better \"who done it comedies\" to be seen without having to wade through a sewer of inane and gratuitous expletives. Don't let the star-studded cast seduce you into wasting your time or money. See something else.",
