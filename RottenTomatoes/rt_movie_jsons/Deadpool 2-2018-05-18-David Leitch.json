            "content": "In many ways an example of a typical movie sequel. Deadpool was great and Deadpool 2 tried to one-up it by being bigger while relying too much on references to the first movie. To its credit, it tries a different direction when it comes to the heart of the story though I found it significantly less effective. Deadpool 2 is still a funny and entertaining action movie, but don't expect any more than that.",

The film is jam-packed with action, humor, and pop culture references that are sure to please fans of the character. However, while there are plenty of laughs and thrilling set pieces, some of the jokes fall flat and the plot can feel a bit formulaic at times. Overall, if you're a fan of Deadpool or superhero movies in general, you'll likely enjoy Deadpool 2, but it may not quite live up to the high bar set by its predecessor.",

Sure, the plot does feel a bit all over the place and there's a lot of new characters, but it manages to ultimately pull it off like a bowl of perfectly executed spaghetti meatballs - messy but darn good. The latter scenes of the third act did come off as a bit odd to me and it certainly felt as if the director got a bit lazy towards the end. Deadpool can come off as a tad exhausting at times, but again that is overshadowed by the broader positive aspects of the film.  That Jared Kushner line was probably the one thing that made me laugh out loud out of the two movies; that and the topographical map of Utah line. Altogether, it's an excellent film.",

There's plenty of wisecracks made - random questions and the like (references to Yentl and Dub Step being 2 examples) and the CGI is pretty impressive. There are some good chase scenes too. It's a film to switch off and enjoy but nothing more. I'm not a particular fan of superhero films as such overall - I've liked a few but I'm by no means an expert in the area, although I did think it was a bit amusing how the central character references characters from other comic book-based film franchises (this is a Marvel Studios film and he references DC, as in DC comics etc.). Suffice to say, I wouldn't recommend letting younger teens watch this, as it is pretty heavy on bloody violence but then if you know anything about the character then that's hardly a surprise and indeed it's been given the 15 rating in the UK (you have to be 15 to see it). The cast is pretty good and its an entertaining watch, so I'd recommend it on that basis, yes.",

        {
            "content": "I'm gonna say it, \"Deadpool 2\" is my favorite comic book movie of all time. hell, it goes on the top 3 movies of all time list for me or even my favorite movie of all time. because i love \"Deadpool 2\" a lot. Every scene is executed perfectly and puts a smile on my face throughout the entirety of \"Deadpool 2\". (Even 1 of the posters for \"Deadpool 2\" says \"From The Studio Who Killed Wolverine) I can't say that there are any unnecessary scenes or scenes that go on for too long. because for me, \"deadpool 2\" is the perfect movie that i can recommend to anyone without delay. There are so many great things about this movie that I love about it, that I don't know where to start. \n\nFirstly, the jokes go from excellent to peak comedy. There is 1 joke towards the end of the movie where deadpool tells cable to \"zip it thanos\" and cable's actor actually played thanos in infinity war and endgame (and that said actor being Josh Brolin) makes the joke so much more funnier. And speaking of that joke, \"Deadpool 2\"'s humor does not disintegrate in terms of who they go after. Like they go after other marvel characters (Zip it black black widow) and (give me a bow and arrow and i am basically hawkeye), they go after the DC Universe (You're so dark, i wonder your from the DC universe) and even pop culture references (keep your hand off of that child, john connor). There is even a scene where Deadpool and firefist call out Colossus for stealing a line from \"Robocop\". There are plenty of jokes I am leaving out because you need to experience hearing those jokes for yourself, they are that good. \n\nSecondly, the music choice for this movie is excellent in \"Deadpool 2\". Its music choice shows that this movie can be emotional and funny at the same time. Like during 1 emotional, slow-motion scene at the end, they play \"Tomorrow\" from \"Annie\". Which is hilarious because of the song choice but, also fits the scene because of the emotional context it has now because of what it's playing over. And then, the next scene uses an acoustic version of \"Take On Me\" by \"a-ha\" which is extremely well done and adds this emotional context to the song that wouldn't have been there if that context wasn't there. Also this version of \"Take On Me\" makes you realize the lyrics and the meaning of those lyrics in this acoustic version of \"Take On Me\". which you would have probably missed if you listened to the normal version of  \"Take On Me\". They Also use dubstep as a running joke in the movie. After watching \"Deadpool 2\" makes me want to listen to more dubstep because dubstep sounds so cool to me. Another Well done scene for me was the intro where deadpool goes around the world and kills some bad guys and they put on dolly parton's \"9 to 5\" which again works really well here. Same with the into. They got Celine Delion to sing an original theme for \"Deadpool 2\". Which makes \"Deadpool 2\"'s intro more like a James Bond intro. (which is what they are trying to parody here.) and that is perfect for this type of film, where it makes fun of superhero and general movie tropes/clich\u00e9s. \n\nThirdly, the characters and the casting choices for these characters are once again, perfect. Like everyone knows that Ryan Reynolds was born to play Wade Willson/Deadpool. Also, Ryan Reynolds plays the voice of Juggernaut in \"Deadpool 2\". Which was a nice surprise to see. Next, Josh Brolin was also perfect in this movie and gave off a lot of that terminator vibes with his character and his performance. and, Morena Baccarin as Vanessa was good, despite the short screen time she is given in \"Deadpool 2\". Julian Dennison as Firefist killed it with his performance. No matter what scene he was in. Also Zazie Beetz As Domino, T.J. Miller as Weasel, Leslie Uggams as Blind Al, Karan Soni as Dopinder, Brianna Hildebrand as Negasonic Teenage Warhead, Shioli Kutsuna as Yukio, Rob Delaney as Peter and Stefan Kapicic as Colossus were very good in their performances here. 2 surprising casting choices were a Brad Pitt cameo as Vanisher and Pennywis-, I mean Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd as Zeitgeist. (also, his role in the movie is very fitting to his past performances, especially the \"It\" Reboot and its sequel). Both Brad Pitt and Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd are excellent, despite their short screen time. \n\nFourthly, I just want to say \"Deadpool 2\" has the best post-credits of any movie of all time. They even go to \"X-men origins: Wolverine\" and the time when Ryan Reynolds received the script for the green lantern movie and there is even an extra scene in the post credits scene in the super duper $@%!#& cut (which i didn't see) which was really funny and surprised that they didn't put the theatrical cut of \"Deadpool 2\". \n\nIn Conclusion, \"Deadpool 2\" I would recommend to everyone (hell, it even says it's a family film as a joke or foreshadowing the existence of \"Once Upon A Deadpool\") and this film is oscar-worthy for me. I Know that \"Deadpool 2\" Isn't For Everyone, But, I think everyone should give \"Deadpool 2\" a watch.",

            "content": "It is not very common for highly successful superhero movies that explore a new genre have an equally successful sequel. Superman and Superman II, Iron Man and Iron Man 2, Man of Steel and Batman v Superman, there are plenty of examples where a great movie is followed by a mediocre or even a bad sequel. But this one is definitely not one of them. Rather I like Deadpool 2 more than its prequel. Since the previous movie was more set up in order to give an origin story and have the regular good guy vs bad guy fight, it did not have much time to explore over its humour. And this is exactly where Deadpool 2 does the job.\n\nThe story revolves around Wade Wilson once again with his popping over his wife's death by a bunch of mercenaries and alongside that he is trying to save a boy from becoming a supervillain and getting killed by Cable. This movie it takes itself very lightly just like the prequel and breaks the fourth wall continuously as the story passes by. There is even a joke on Josh Brolin playing the role of cable as Deadpool says, \"Suck it, Thanos!\". Multiple comic scenes take place throughout the movie e which include the formation of the X-Force, Deadpool being made an X-Men trainee and no one taking him seriously, Wade Wilson been sent to prison, Deadpool fighting Cable and releasing all the mutants only to be ripped in half by Juggernaut and Deadpool growing out as a baby from the bottom half.\n\nThe action scenes of this movie are even better than the previous one. I really like the scene from the beginning of the movie where Deadpool is fighting a bunch of Yakuzas in Osaka. The camera revolves around Deadpool as he slices down all the man who have come to save the leader. When juggernaut and colossus are about to fight Deadpool says, \"Big CGI fight coming up!\". When he is about to fight cable for the first time, Cable ask him who he is to which he replies, \"I am Batman!\". Overall there are multiple action comedy scenes sprinkled all across the movie.\n\nThe movie also gives an important message, which is not something we normally see in an X-Men movie. Deadpool tells Russell to let the headmaster live, as killing him would send him on the path of villainy from which it will be impossible to come back. Instead of Russell Deadpool chooses to take the bullet from Cable and his death becomes the reason why Russell chooses to give up killing and become a good person instead. This also saves Cable's family from dying and he can go back in peace. But soon afterwards that message is discarded after the headmaster is run over by Dopinder's taxi, thus fulfilling his dream of becoming a contract killer.\n\nDeadpool 2, being the movie for a mature audience as it is, is hard to think of home to watch with, considering such a movie cannot be watched with the family and friends have watched it anyway. This is the reason why it's a good thing they decided to make a sequel of this movie and connect it to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. If Dark Phoenix and The New Mutants were not made, this could have been the most perfect way to culminate the X-Men franchise and merge it with the remaining Marvel Cinematic Universe. I can't wait to watch more of this.",

Before watching this film, I thought that Deadpool would not be able to offer something new in the sequel (as it is), but this is not the main thing, the main thing is that the creators took into account the mistakes of the first film and rehabilitated them in the second without being torn between psychological drama and black comedy, but purely creating a black comedy, not guaranteeing that the output will be something great, but about everything in order ...\n\nGet away, romance!\n\nIf the previous plot of the film was built on Wade's uneven and superficial love for ... (I forgot it already), then in this film the creators decided to focus on the main character, on his redemption. Immortal Wade, who does not think that his immortality does not apply to those he loves, loses his fate for a happy life. The writers begin, for the most part, to focus on the inner torment of the protagonist, and not try to squeeze sour juice out of unnecessary romance. More indicative, in terms of the quality of the film, are the opening credits, which, unlike the original, make fun of at least something (films about 007), which makes us understand that a reckless black comedy awaits us (and this happens after the tragedy with the hero), which already says the viewer \"do not worry about anything\".\n\nSecondary heroes have a place to be!\n\nIf an ordinary viewer wondered when watching the first film about the senselessness of the abundance of secondary characters appearing in the plot, just as a panorama for the mainstream, then in the second part, they are exactly in the places in which they should be. Someone brings the main character intimate friendship and love, revealing Deadpool from a positive side (Colossus, Cable, an old woman, a Mexican kid), and someone serves as a method of mockery of modern trends (Force X group, Warhead with an Asian lesbian, taxi driver) ... A bespectacled man with outhouse humor is still not needed in the film, but with such an abundance of colorful characters, he has a place to get lost. In general, one feels that all these characters are not indifferent to the main character (given his tragedy), which is why they automatically become not indifferent to us.\n\nThe authors are still egg-free.\n\nThe creators don't want to take risks. The film is still built on a stereotyped principle, like any superhero movie, but only in a funky manner and is perfectly aware of this, unlike the first film, which makes it better. But, he is also afraid to step aside and show the viewer an extravagant new thing that would revolutionize the idea of \u200b\u200bcomic-book films. The only thing left is to hope that the authors will do their best in the third film (hopefully, in the final one), but for now, we still have another sequel, which has learned to correctly prioritize.\n\nOutcome\n\nI love Deadpool. If the first film introduced me to this character at all and interested him, then the second film began to show him in all its glory. As a result, we got a solid black comedy with beer and chips.\n\n7 out of 10",

Josh Brolin as an even darker character than Thanos (at first) was great. I loved Zazie Beetz, as well. Hilarious, heartbreaking, explosive fun with a surprisingly touching story. The anti-religious thing was so blatant that it made me cringe and it didn't fit in with the movie at all.

This is way way better than the original film, it had everything I wanted from deadpool even though the family theme was so 2017. Aka Lego Batman and fast and furious makes this movie, both 2017 movies. This movie gave me a more emotional deadpool, a family man after losing a beloved person in his life. Now let's talk about the real star in this movie, none other than the person who plays domino, zazie betez or something like that. Domino is wonderful in this movie but I wanted a little bit more, she can kick some serious stuff and everything about her character is phenomenal. Every scene she's in ,she in my opinion steals the show. Next up Peter, man, they killed Peter except psych he comes back in the post credits but you know who doesn't come back, everybody on x force except dead pool, domino, and you guessed it now Peter. Everybody died just like infinity war. Thanos himself aka cable was buff and dark. I can't wait to see what's next but before I sign off I gotta talk about what I hated about this film. No stan flipping lee and barely any xmen. Just the one little cameo. Disney or universal, whoever buys fox needs to make an xmen deadpool movie.",

Part of the plot is just a rip off of The Terminator, part of the plot is a copy of X-Men, and the writing was just generally disappointing. The cinematography and soundtrack were still good, and the visual effects were fine but could have been better in places. The action was decent although must of the fighting happened at the beginning. The acting was all right, but the original characters were better. The plot was mostly predictable and nothing new besides some stupid elements such as the X-Force bit. Sadly things got a little bit political with the talk of X-Men being sexist and there was some anti-religion/anti-Church stuff in here as well. Deadpool 2 is just another mediocre-below average superhero film. This genre really needs to die now as it's been bloated and stale for a long time.",

This movie is amazing, taking the many facets of the word family and showcasing them all in a single film. Domino's abilities are very well displayed, watching her mutant ability in action was quite satisfying. This film is filled with Easter Eggs and references, but my personal favorite is when he returns to the apartment, we see the bag labelled as The Cure for Blindness. The mid and post credit sequences were hilarious and probably gave Ryan a sense of closure for a couple of his most infamous film roles.

            "content": "In 2016, the first movie proved to producers that a R-rated Superhero film could be viable, making over $ 780 million at the box office. Hilariously rude and imaginative, DEADPOOL was like no other comic book film before. Ryan Reynolds inhabits the character to perfection, making him a lovable wise-ass, that just happens to be a ruthless contract killer. But it insistently refuses to take its ''hero'' seriously, which is one of the main charm of the film.\n\nIn fact, both DEADPOOL movies rest on Ryan Reynolds' shoulders. His obvious passion for the character is communicative, and it would be hard to imagine someone else inhabiting the character with such gusto. And inhabiting may be the right word; Reynolds has been a producer on both films, and owns personally one of the costume that he gleefully wears at any occasion to promote the films, creating viral videos and surprise appearances as Deadpool that demonstrate a level of commitment to a character which is rare in motion pictures. He literally bought into the Merc with a Mouth lock, stock and barrel.\n\nAnd this passion pays off. He obviously has fun with the character, and the audience gleefully tags along for the wild ride. Written by the same team which tackled the 2016 original, with the addition of Reynolds himself, DEADPOOL 2 boasts the same healthy dose of self-referential and even self deprecating humor, numerous pulp culture references, and outrageous action scenes with somewhat ribald slow-motion moments. The strong identity of  Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick' script is such that you hardly feel the difference in direction. DEADPOOL director Tim Miller, after having some of those pesky ''creative differences'' with Reynolds (allegedly over who should play Cable), left the sequel to focus on rebooting the TERMINATOR franchise for James Cameron. The directing job then went to Stuntman David Leitch who had directed some scenes for the impressive JOHN WICK, and made his feature directing debut with ATOMIC BLONDE. \n\nThe film certainly does not lack energy, yet loses a bit of steam during Deadpool's incarceration in a maximum security prison for super-powered perps, as his depression over the loss of his girlfriend, assassinated at the beginning of the film, tends to drag down the film in a direction that feels somewhat lacking. After the High-Octane craziness of the first film, the attempts to make Wilson more human by having him moping around about his lost love or caring about saving the life of a kid feels forced. There's nothing wrong with a bit of virtue in our heroes, but it seems a bit out of place with Deadpool. Then again, it does help the character to move away from his ''creep'' status, so it may not be a bad idea. Just not subtle. Yet Deadpool is not exactly where you go for subtlety, so...\n\nThe cast, lead of course by an enthusiastic Ryan Reynolds, is top notch. Josh Brolin manages to bring a certain amount of rough around the edges depth to the time-traveling Cable, exuding the same kind of rugged charm that even transpired in his motion captured role as Thanos in last month's AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR. Zazie Beets owns the screen as Domino, whose unusual super-power of just been lucky leads to some of the best action sequences of the film. Young Kiwi actor Julian Dennison, who stole Taika (THOR RAGNAROK) Waititi's HUNT FOR THE WILDERPEOPLE from co-star Sam Neill, continues to demonstrate his considerable talent for both drama and comedy as the troubled Firefist, and his pugnacious attitude is the only thing making Deadpool's obsession with saving him feel not as maudlin. \n\nI could talk about the casting for the team formed by Deadpool to accomplish this mission, X-FORCE, but suffice it to say that they have one killer scene in the film that surprisingly made me glad to see a live action rendition of characters I tend to find aggressively uninteresting on the page. It's an actual highlight of the film. Nuff said.\n\nIn the end, this may be just another R-Rated, big-budget, avocado-faced, butt-grabbin'\", rip-snortin', gun-tottin', pop culture lovin', wise-crackin' ode to adolescent humor, but if you laughed your ass off with the first one, you'll get more of the same with this one. There is more than enough room to poke fun at the superhero genre that is so predominant in the theatres these days. Although paradoxically, this just adds to the unending proliferation of grown men running around in silly costumes on the silver screen.\n\nAnd I wouldn't have it any other way. \nI know.\nI need help.",

The characters were well cast.  Josh Brolin is a good Cable and a great fit for Deadpool.  Cable is a mirror image of Deadpool, and gives Wade a chance to look at himself from the outside in.  Domino is a fun character and the actress was a great choice for the role.  My only knit pick is that she is black with a white dot instead of white with a black dot, like, a domino.  I am a fan of the comics and have grown to enjoy Domino for years.  I think it would be cool if they added another Domino who was like the comics and see how the interaction between the characters would play out.  Perhaps something like an echo of Cable and Deadpool or alternative timelines colliding. (Comics meets movie versions of all the characters.)  I enjoyed that the movie brought back many characters from the first movie who start off the opposite of Deadpool, but the movie address the subjectivity of 'good' vs 'evil'.  I think that the characters developed a lot in the movie and by the end I feel that the pieces fit nicely and it felt complete.  \n\nOne negative the movie did have was some deaths that I really wish weren't there.  I think that the acquisition from Disney will bury the story of the X-Force for a possible side reboot of sorts, which I think Deadpool being immune to would be interesting.  The comics deal a lot with different realities and timelines, and I think that would make things very interesting.

That night, after the pair decide to start a family together, the target tracks Wilson down and inadvertently kills Vanessa. Wilson kills the man in revenge, and blaming himself for her death attempts to commit suicide six weeks later by blowing himself up. Wilson has a vision of Vanessa in the afterlife, but the pieces of his body remain alive and are put back together by Colossus. Wilson is left with only a Skee-Ball token, an anniversary gift, as a final memento of Vanessa. Recovering at the X-Mansion, Wilson reluctantly agrees to join the X-Men because he believes Vanessa would have wanted him to. He, Colossus, and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) respond to a standoff between authorities and the unstable young mutant Russell Collins / Firefist at an orphanage, labeled a \"Mutant Reeducation Center\". Wilson realizes that Collins has been abused by the orphanage staff, and kills one of the staff members. Colossus stops him from killing anyone else, and both Wilson and Collins are arrested. Restrained with collars that suppress their powers, they are taken to the Ice Box, an isolated prison for mutant criminals. Meanwhile, Cable (Josh Brolin) a cybernetic soldier from the future whose family is murdered by an older Collins\u2014travels back in time to kill Collins before he ever becomes a killer...\n\nRotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads, \"Though it threatens to buckle under the weight of its meta gags, Deadpool 2 is a gory, gleeful lampoon of the superhero genre buoyed by Ryan Reynolds' undeniable charm. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, jokingly calling it the best sequel since The Godfather Part II and saying: \"Deadpool 2 is wicked, dark fun from start to finish, with some twisted and very funny special effects, cool production elements [and] terrific ensemble work.\" PopMatters writer J.R. Kinnard wrote: \"If you enjoyed the guilty pleasures of Deadpool, it's an immutable law of physics that you will love Deadpool 2. The second verse may be the same as the first, but that verse is a dirty limerick of childish goodness.\" Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film 3 out of 4 stars and wrote, \"Deadpool 2 is just like Deadpool only more so. It's actually a fair bit better\u2014funnier, more inventive than the 2016 smash...and more consistent in its chosen tone and style: ultraviolent screwball comedy.\" A.O. Scott of The New York Times was critical of the cynical tone of the film, writing \"something ever so slightly dishonest about this character, something false about the boundaries drawn around his sadism and his rage. Deadpool 2 dabbles in ugliness and transgression, but takes no real creative risks.\" New York writer David Edelstein wrote that the film was tedious and predictable, noting \"A superhero movie with the looseness of a Mad magazine parody remains a viable idea, as demonstrated by the underrated Mystery Men and, of course, Deadpool. But a film that spits one-liners as mechanically as a tennis-ball launcher is even more tediously predictable than one with no sense of humor at all.\"\n\nI must say I do love this second Deadpool movie, even more than the first one. It\u00b4s witty, under the belt funny, violent beyond borders and crazy with a great dialogue/script and a fantastic character gallery. Love Josh Brolin as Cable and Zazie Beetz as Domino (Wow!). And I do like T.J. Miller as Weasel. \"Deadpool 2\" is excellently filmed and edited and the CGI is great as well. Gotta give cred to Director David Leitch for putting together one hell of a cartoon comic film with a great mix of action and comedy. I am looking forward to the third installment of Deadpool!",

Not only was it hilarious and action-packed, but it had a lot of drama, emotion and an engaging story with lovable characters! This movie is pretty much the same, just with a bigger budget. You see a lot more locations with a lot more characters in this movie, and the action was improved as well! It was also a little funnier than the original, I think! It had a lot of heart as well. I'm not gonna lie, I got a little choked up at a few parts!

There are constant visual and spoken gags, references, 4th-wall breaking, etc. The humour is a bit irreverent and blokey, but it is just so clever and witty that you can't help but like it. The performance and charisma was also exceptional throughout, holding the narrative together. I enjoyed this more than the first installment and am now wondering if there'll be a third in the series.

Not only are many of the jokes recycled from the first film, but many of the pop culture references were flat. The movie even explained some of the jokes just in case you didn't get it.\n\nThe movie is 2 hours long and I felt that it could've been shorter. The prison scene took up far too much screentime, and the \"death\" scene near the end went on for far too long. Sorry for \"spoiling\" the movie, but Deadpool 2 already did that at the beginning of the film.\n\nThe only scene I enjoyed in the film was the prison transport fight scene, but that's it. The movie was unfunny and tonally inconsistent, the supporting characters were forgettable and the movie has almost twice the budget of the previous film, but the production value doesn't look better.

Zazie Beetz is also great in a supporting role as Domino.

            "content": "Deadpool 2\n(2018)\n\nPlot:\nAmerican action thriller in which Ryan Reynolds reprises his role as alternative superhero Wade Wilson, AKA Deadpool. When a mysterious young boy with incredible powers captures the attention of the ruthless time-travelling mutant Cable (Josh Brolin), Deadpool must acquire a group of fellow rebels with incredible abilities to stop Cable in his path of destruction and save the boy.\n\nReview:\nAlthough I preferred the first movie, mainly because it was unique and quite shocking in parts, I did find this movie funny, even though I wanted Ryan Reynolds to shut up most of the time. The action scenes were pretty impressive and I liked Josh Brolin as Cable but I found Firefist a bit misplaced. Domino was also a great addition to the so-called X-Force but I would have liked to have seen more from Negasonic, who was great in the first movie. I think the main problem with this film is that we're not seeing anything new from Deadpool. We do get to see a bit of an emotional side after the dramatic beginning, and his relationship with Firefist shows that he has a heart, but from a superhero point of view, it's very much like the first movie. As usual, the jokes do go a bit far sometimes, but that's what makes Deadpool a unique character that is certainly different from the other superheroes on the market. The movie is set with Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) successfully working as a mercenary for two years, but when his girlfriend Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) is sadly murdered after they decide to start a family, Deadpool tries many ways to kill himself. Colossus saves him after another attempt on his own life, and he takes him to the X-Mansion to rehabilitate. During his rehabilitation, Colossus and Negasonic respond to a standoff between authorities and the unstable young mutant Firefist (Julian Dennison) at an orphanage labelled a \"Mutant Re-education Center\". Deadpool realises that Firefist has been abused by the orphanage staff, and kills one of them, even though he agreed with Colossus not to kill anyone. Soon after that, Firefist and Deadpool are arrested and restrained with collars, which makes them unable to use their powers. Meanwhile, Cable (Josh Brolin) - a cybernetic soldier from the future whose family is murdered by an older Firefist - travels back in time to kill him before he ever becomes a killer. Cable breaks into the prison and attempts to kill Firefist, but Deadpool's collar breaks and he defends Firefist, who is unaware of why Cable is trying to kill him. Firefist overhears Deadpool saying that he doesn't care for him, so he gives himself up to the guards. Deadpool puts together a team, called the X-Force, to break Firefist out of a prison-transfer convoy, and defend him from Cable. During there mission, most of his team die whilst landing from a parachute jump, except for Deadpool and Domino (Zazie Beetz). Whilst fighting against Cable, Firefist frees fellow inmate Juggernaut, who agrees to help him kill the abusive orphanage headmaster. Juggernaut destroys the convoy, allowing himself and Firefist to escape. Cable offers to work with Deadpool and Domino to stop Firefist's first murder and agrees to give Deadpool a chance to talk him down. After an epic battle between the newly formed X-Force, Firefist and Juggernaut, Deadpool fails to talk down Firefist, so Cable attempts to kill him. Deadpool ends up jumping in front of the bullet, and after Firefist sees his sacrifice to save him, he doesn't kill the headmaster, who is eventually run over by Deadpool's driver Dopinder (Karan Soni). With Firefist under control, Cable uses the last charge on his time-travelling device, which he needed for returning to his family, to go back several minutes to stop the bullet from killing Deadpool. It's hard to see where they can take this franchise because they cram so much into one movie. With the newly formed X-Force, and the introduction to some new superheroes, the possibilities are endless but Deadpool is the Marvel cash-cow that has got audiences begging for more. Personally, I think his non-stop banter, and crazy one-liners won't last forever, but now that he has access to the time-travelling device, Marvel has the chance to do something special with the 3rd movie. I just hope they don't mess it up! Anyway, this movie is definitely worth a watch, especially if you were a fan of the first movie, but I would like to see him face a worthy opponent, who he would have to take seriously. Watchable!\n\nRound-Up:\nThis movie was directed by David Leitch, who also brought you John Wick and Atomic Blonde. He's due to remake Enter the Dragon, which should be left alone, and the Division starring Jessica Chastain and Jake Gyllenhaal. He's also filming a Fast & Furious spin-off called Hobbs & Shaw, which is about Dwayne Johnson's character from the Fast & Furious, teaming up with Jason Statham. It also stars Idris Elba so it's definitely a blockbuster that should get a good reception. As for this movie, it's very well written and full of action from the beginning to the end. The references to different movies cracked me up, and when Deadpool went back in time to kill Hitler, I just couldn't stop laughing. It certainly went down well with the critics, and it made a hefty profit at the box office but it's currently 100th in the highest-grossing movie chart, with the original in 85th place with a $783million profit. Although it's primarily a comedy, there is a lot of gory scenes, which meant that it's not suitable for kids, so that might explain why the profit wasn't as big as a lot of the other Marvel movies. Anyway, I can't wait for a 3rd instalment, and I hope they involve some of the X-Men.\n\nBudget: $110million\nWorldwide Gross: $742million\n\nGenre: Action, Adventure, Comedy, Sci-Fi\nCast: Ryan Reynolds, Josh Brolin, Morena Baccarin, Julian Dennison, Zazie Beetz, T.J. Miller, Karan Soni, Eddie Marsan, Terry Crews, Brad Pitt, Paul Wu, Matt Damon, Bob Delaney and Leslie Uggams. 7/10\n\nPlease check out my Movie Review blog at leonblackwood.wordpress.com",

The characters (Brolin's great), the action/fight sequences (David Leitch brings the Wick style), the locations - yes, everything is bigger, better, more interesting and more entertaining.

With the surprise enormous success of Deadpool in February 2016, most were concerned, myself included, that Deadpool might fall into that realm of \"trying to outdue it's predecessor\". Director David Leitch, of 'John Wick' fame does a great job of taking that fast paced, brutal action & injecting it into the Deadpool comedy realm, created by Rhett Rheese, Paul Wernick and Ryan Reynolds in the first movie. To me, the first was a Romantic Comedy with action thrown in here and there. This is more of an Action-Comedy and feels different. BUT a good different.\n\nNow, that's not to say that this movie doesn't have its flaws, and pardon this next part here for being a tad off the cuff. The thing about this movie that didn't put it into the upper echelon like the first Deadpool is the supporting cast. Brolin and Beetz are both PERFECTLY CAST as Cable and Domino but are completely underutilized in their roles and time on screen. Instead the focus and momentum is shifted to Julian Dennison, who plays teenage mutant Russell.\n\nRemember that old song\n\"Oneeee of these things is not like the other, not like the other .... \"\nYa. That's him.\nHe's the \"other\" in this movie. \nLoud, screaming all the time and completely unfunny and at times brought me out.\n\nOverall though, one bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch , and with Reynolds, Brolin & Beetz expected to come back for part 3, we will get more banter and mayhem with the aptly named 'X-Force'.

Movie with the recruiting scene and when they have their first mission,I love comic books especially marvels so these first 2 Deadpool movies are the first that feel like true x men live action films straight off the pages and I thought x men first class showed this as well\nDeadpool wants a family this time around with Vanessa played by Morena baccarin ,one thing leads to another and he decides to protect russel played by Julian dennison from cable \nweak points of this movie is the villain ,there\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)s really no villain but finally seeing cable on screen will be a nice for comic fans I\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)m not quite sure who was the perfect choice for this part,early sketch\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)s of brad Pitt only shows us what could have been ,which could of been a completely different movie with more of a focus on cable which could have helped this movie more\n\ncolorful ,raunchy,bloody,funny and at the same time has a big hart,the merc with a mouth is a sick ,violent killer who can\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)t die,it\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)s hard to feel for someone like that but the writers figure out a way to make u feel bad to the point where it even has a tear jerker scene in a movie about a comic book character ,who goes on numerous killing sprees with a smile on his face dancing to salt n peppa \n\nThis movie gets 3 and a half spliffs from me I enjoyed the comedy and action and nice surprises,definitely worth seeing on the big screen",

Ryan Reynolds returns as the merc with a mouth. this movie was different from the first movie due to the fact that Wade Wilson loses the love of his life to a bullet driving him into a depression. This event though makes his character grow throughout the film as he try's to protect and save Russel or fire fist a kid with a heated temper if you get my drift. The jokes land and the X-force scene was one of the funniest scenes in both of the Deadpool movies and is my favorite.  The addition of cable played by Josh Brolin AKA Thanos put more emotional investment into this movie making him a good Character who also grows through the movie going from a man wanting revenge for the death of his family to doing the right thing even if he don't want to. This movie was enjoyable and I can't wait to see what Deadpool brings to the MCU",

Was the script and story anything to write home about? Of course not! Was there a lot of gratuitous violence? Hell yes! But then, this was pretty much what could be expected. Anyone offended or surprised by this should not really have picked this movie in the first place.\n\nDespite the fairly juvenile jokes, the sometime illogical script and the way over the top chop-chop-and-chop-some-more violence I had great fun watching this movie. I really enjoyed the action sequences a'la Kill Bill, the special effects and yes, the jokes. Most of the time at least)\n\nEverything was so silly and over the top that it actually became funny. Each scene, taken by itself, would probably have been considered silly, or even bad, by me but stringed together in the context of the movie as a whole it just worked. For me at least.\n\nThe action sequences, CGI and everything that should be in a superhero movie was, in my mind, quite good. Also, despite not really being anything to write home about the story was quite adequate. Simple, straightforward and a lot better than the crap that a lot of the stuff that social and political correctness preaching writers at Marvel are spewing out these days.\n\nI definitely liked Cable as the hard hitting ass-kicking cyborg. When Domino was first introduced I was not impressed, even though she's hot. I mean, luck as a superpower? However, when she started to pull all these hilarious stunts with these incredibly unbelievable chains of events I quickly changed my mind. Oh, and I did like Deadpool of course. That goes without saying. If you do not like the main protagonist it is difficult to like the movie itself is it not?\n\nMost of the other characters were between okay and so so. The one character I never really liked was Firefist. He was never funny, just incredibly stupid and childish.\n\nThe team of fellow mutant \"warriors\" that Deadpool pulled together? Well let's say that I am not that disappointed that they were somewhat \"expendable\" but it looks like that was the whole point of it. When the first of them whammed into that bus I thought \"What the f...?\" and then it just continued with one gory event following another. Nice touch with the blue blood by the way. I guess the guy was an alien after all.\n\nTo sum it up, a lot of the movie was pretty much what I expected but altogether I think I was positively surprised. Two hours of great fun actually.",

With the enlarged budget and heightened expectations, not to mention the change in director, far more of the laughs feel forced and manufactured. If the first spent 90% of its time in the character's wheelhouse, the sequel goes for something closer to 25%, and a majority of that is in the second act. Ryan Reynolds remains a picture-perfect casting choice, I loved his contrast with Josh Brolin as Cable, Zazie Beetz is a spunky, welcome addition as Domino, but the plot structure feels too tame and the jokes more restrained. Rather than doubling down, we've lightened up and settled for a handful of throwbacks to what worked last time.

But now I think it has really weeded its way into my Marvel favorites with this sequel. Thinking of the different aspects of the film, the biggest successes that stood out to me were the chemistry between characters and the unpredictability of the story. This is especially true with the new characters (ahem, Domino) and the X-Force. As usual, nobody else can ever play Deadpool the way Ryan Reynolds does. Also, they really stepped it up with the references, poking fun at DC and Wolverine at every turn. Long story short, I just loved it. If you're a true X-Men fan, these two movies are a must and I'd even say that they're closer to the comics than the rest of the X-Men franchise. Just don't bring kids.",

The sequel feels unique, it's familiar to the rest of the X-Men franchise, with the little kid looking for salvation, and a misfit family, but it forges its own path within those themes.

Bad language is often employed as a substitute for wit, and the controversial inclusion of Vanessa, Deadpool's love interest, doesn't add much to the story, and she pops up so rarely and with so little plot impact that her part could have been cut out, and it would have left more space to develop the other characters.

I was pretty critical of the first \"Deadpool\" because it seemed to focus more on R-rated humor and what gags could be permitted under that banner instead of crafting a good story for Wade Wilson to take part in, but that is NOT the case this time around. The humorous stuff comes from the situations Deadpool finds himself in, rather than it ALWAYS being the joke factory pouring from his mouth, and that makes all the difference (plus, it allows him to evolve as a character). Coming in this year-of-all-years in the superhero \"Golden Age Decade\" for silver-screen adaptations (with huge, \"world-ending events), I especially appreciated the relative \"small-potatoes\" stakes of this story compared to the other big superhero movies that have been released. The flick had a very high \"hit-to-miss\" ratio on the successful gags in there, and I was hilariously shocked to see some of the things they got away with (as far as jokes not only ragging on the Marvel Universe, but also across the aisle at DC and even movies you would not expect to be referenced in a soft-\"R,\" potty-mouthed, blood-soaked superhero movie). The movie also benefits (from a visual and action standpoint) from the upgrade to \"John Wick\" director David Leitch (after Tim Miller left the project). A few minor niggles, along with some dodgy CGI in places, keep the film from complete greatness, though, even if they don't mess it up too badly. First, I really do not feel a major act in the first portion of the film had to occur to give Wade the proper motivation to travel on the journey he goes on in the flick; I think it could have been done in a way that the sequence I speak of did not need to incite Deadpool's growth. The other thing is how shortchanged the supporting cast gets in terms of screen time and development. Even if I already have a working background knowledge of these folks as a comics fan, as a movie-lover I wanted to see much more from Zazie Beets' Domino and Josh Brolin as Cable; however, they are not afforded enough time and care to offer more than the basics and one-dimensional personas, info on where they come from and what drives them, and the like. Still, this film serves as a very entertaining romp, and even matches up to \"Infinity War\" on poignant moments. They went too far on the sexy/gutsy-gore stuff and forgot about a story in the first one, but they got the formula right this time. I cannot wait for a third (unless Disney cancels it with the Fox merger), and viewers should avoid missing out on this one.",

            "content": "Unlike many, I wasn't the biggest fan of 2016's Deadpool. The ultra-violent, tightly focused screenplay was refreshing and frequently benefitted from its hard-R rating, but many of its low-effort sophomoric jokes fell flat, personally. The resulting dialogue didn't seem to flow well and only occasionally squeezed genuine emotion out of me. Still, it was an enjoyable enough film, and I was taken aback by the amount of care and development given to this strange parodic remnant from the 90's. Deadpool 2 is a solid continuation that offers more of the same, with some refinement along the way.\nUnder copious amounts of blood and vulgarity, Deadpool was a romantic comedy disguised as a superhero movie. With a focus on family, Deadpool 2 is a logical continuation of Wade Wilson's (Ryan Reynolds) surprisingly tender character arc as he struggles to save a young mutant from a time-traveling cybernetic assassin, Cable (Josh Brolin), while reconciling his differences with the heroes at Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters.\nThe intimate moments between Wilson and his girlfriend, Vanessa (Morena Baccarin), were easily the highlights of the first film, and Deadpool 2 offers more complexity to its hero through a tragic first half. Reynolds once again lends the otherwise farcical character some serious depth that sucked me in emotionally and kept me invested through to the end. Seeing Wilson grieve and feel real, genuine emotion yielded far and away the high points of the film. Though it doesn't make much sense for a film that's at heart a raunchy comedy made for teens, I would have loved for these excellent dramatic points to take more focus.\nWhat Deadpool 2 does offer in spades is a never-ending onslaught of quips, self-referential humor, and pop-culture references. Though it can get tiring, the humor feels more effortful this time around thanks to a greater variety of jokes that focus more on situational comedy (there's a great gag involving regenerating limbs that almost had me in tears) than lowest-common-denominator wisecracks. The dialogue feels less forced as a result, making for a smoother, more seamless viewing experience. The return of Leslie Uggams and Karan Soni as Blind Al and Dopinder the taxi driver, two standouts from the last film, were also very welcome.\nAlongside its heart and funnies, Deadpool 2 also mingles in some satisfying action. There's more to the R-rated gore as the film takes great advantage of Deadpool's acrobatic fighting style and accelerated healing factor in some really neat ways. The addition of the charming newcomer Domino (Zazie Beetz), a mutant whose superpower is good luck, ensured there was always something interesting going on.\nOn that note, fans looking forward to the promise of X-Force from the film's marketing may leave the theater disappointed. I found the use of the team clever in the context of the film's larger theme, though, and was glad it didn't intrude on the small-scale personal ventures of its characters.\nDeadpool 2 only ever excels during its short stints into dramatic territory. For what it's worth, though, the film is a solid comedy with a violent edge that's sure to please many looking for a couple of hours of cheap laughs.",

            "content": "I think a lot of people, myself included, were surprised by how massively successful the original Deadpool was.  As it stands right now, the original Deadpool is the most commercially successful R-rated movie of all time at a gross of $783 million on a $58 million budget.  That's pretty impressive when you think about it, at the time, it was probably the first (major) R-rated superhero movie since the Blade trilogy finished off with Blade Trinity in late 2004.  Ironically, Ryan Reynolds also appeared in this movie.  Having said that, superhero movies weren't as prevalent then as they are now and the Blade Trinity had more limited potential.  At the same time, having had a couple of years to reflect back on the success of the original movie, I can't believe that I was surprised at its success.  First of all, it was a gleefully violent and profane superhero movie that broke the fourth wall constantly in an era when, really, most MCU movies, really, just blended into one another.  That's not saying they were bad, in fact, just the opposite, a lot of them are very good and some of them even excellent.  It's just that stylistically and tonally, those films are completely homogenized to fit within Disney's family-friendly image.  So Deadpool came along at exactly the right place at exactly the right time.  And it's not just that the movie embraced its violence and profanity with pure glee, because that on its own would not be enough, it's the fact that it was a supremely well-written movie.  It really was one of the funniest movies I saw that year.  And people gravitated to that in a world where superheroes are always fighting against the end of the world, it was just fun to watch a smaller, self-contained story that, really, broke all the established rules for what that genre could be.  And its success made it possible for Logan to get more creative leeway in telling its story the way it wanted to and, for all intents and purposes, Logan is revered as one of the best movies in the genre.  It's also making it possible for this New Mutants movie (also from 20th Century Fox) to become a thing.  Essentially the New Mutants is a superhero horror movie set in the X-Men universe.  And, for all you can say about 20th Century Fox, I gotta give them major props for allowing their superhero properties to explore different styles of telling a story than than what is normally accepted for superheroes.  Having said that, the original Deadpool was like catching lightning in a bottle.  I'd be lying if I told you I wasn't a little nervous that this would be disappointing compared to the original movie.  It's obviously not gonna be as fresh as the original, so that newness is gone.  Will they repeat the same jokes?  Will the script be lacking?  Will the story be a jumbled mess?  All of these and many more went across my mind.  Sophmore slumps and all that, it happens.  Iron Man 2 and Age of Ultron weren't as good as the previous installment.  But, wouldn't you know it, Deadpool 2 is equally as great, if not better than the original.  Part of me, as I was watching this movie, was wondering what people were seeing when they were saying it was better.  Because, while certainly very entertaining, at that particular point at least, it wasn't better than the original.  And, honestly, I don't know what the turning point was, but I know that there was a point where I just was like 'ok, this is better than the original'.  Is it more or less gleefully profane and violent as the original?  That I can't determine, but all I know is that I had so much goddamn fun watching this movie and, honestly, I can't remember the last time I had this much fun watching a film.  I had a blast watching Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, but it took me a while to figure out it was meant to be comedic.  This one, on the other hand, is a blast from beginning to end.  One of the things that I like about this franchise, and there's really a whole bunch of them, is the fact that, at its core, there's still a strong character in Wade Wilson.  The original movie was, in its own way, a romance.  Really.  Wade Wilson loves nothing more in this world than Vanessa and the original movie told a really effective, if raunchier, romantic story around these characters.  So, again, the character isn't just about the breaking the fourth wall, killing and just being a dick.  Thanks to Vanessa, Wade feels like a real enough person in his own universe.  She gives him purpose and a reason to live.  And I feel that that surprising emotional depth continues in this movie.  This is gonna be spoiler-y, so just skip ahead.  Essentially, Vanessa is murdered at the beginning of the film and Wade goes through this mental breakdown as a result of her death.  They were about to start a family, or at least attempt to do so.  He literally blows himself up at the beginning of the film.  He, eventually, is put back together by Colossus and he takes him to the X-Mansion, where Colossus offers him a spot in the X-Men.  This leads to one hilarious gag where Deadpool, once again, complains about the studio not giving them enough budget to include more X-Men.  In the room next to where he's standing, however, there's a meeting with the X-Men.  Xavier, Beast, Storm, Quicksilver, Cyclops and Nightcrawler all appear, all played by their current actors.  Beast, however, slowly closes the door without Deadpool noticing.  It's a scene that's no longer than 10 seconds, but it's a really funny visual gag.  And the fact they got all the actors to come in for that was also pretty funny.  Anyway, essentially, Deadpool becomes a trainee and he helps attempt to dissolve this situation at a mutant rehab center where this orphan, who controls fire through his fists, is putting himself and others in danger.  Family is one of the biggest themes of this movie.  This kid, Wade assumes and the kid latter confirms it, has been abused by the orphanage staff.  Deadpool kills one of the staff members and him, along with the kid, are thrown in this ice box, which is a prison for mutants where, through this collar, their powers are negated.  Russell, the orphan, finding someone who helped him, gravitates to him due to his issues of abandonment.  Deadpool being Deadpool, he pushes him away and tells him to make friends with the biggest and meanest in the ice box.  Rusell does, in fact, do so and he becomes friends with Juggernaut, who helps him in his quest for revenge against the headmaster of the mutant rehab facility  While this is going on, Cable travels back in time in order to hunt down and kill Russell in order to prevent him from becoming this cold-blooded murderer in the future and save his wife and daughter, both of whom were murdered by an adult Russell in the future.  Cable seems to be some sort of a cyborg or something and, almost right from the start, you're waiting for Deadpool's eventual Terminator joke and, naturally, he doesn't disappoint.  Anyway, Cable is trying to hunt down this kid and kill him and Deadpool feels forced to create his own team to keep Cable from killing Russell (or Firefist, a quite literal name).  Anyway, he adds Domino, The Vanisher (which leads to some really cool moments and a hilarious cameo), Bedlam, Shatterstar, Zeitgeist and a regular man named Peter who thought the ad for the team looked fun.  I feel this is the turning point of the movie for me.  Like all the X-Force members (minus Domino), on this mission to stop this convoy that's moving all the ice box prisoners elsewhere in order to save Russell, end up dying after the jump out of a plane to make a cool and heroic entrance.  Bedlam is driven through this bus' windshield, Shatterstar is chopped up to bits by a helicopter's blades, Zeitgeist flies into a wood chipper and Peter is vomited on by Zeitgeist, who spits acidic...fluids and, of course, he dies.  Oh and The Vanisher electrocutes himself, which is when you see who the actor is.  This part of the movie is hilarious and it bleeds into a really fucking cool action sequence where Domino, whose superpower is luck...yes, really.  This is a running joke in that Deadpool makes fun of her because luck can't be a superpower and, honestly, it's actually really cool.  Just watching things around Domino collapse or move around in her favor was actually cool visually.  Anyway, the action sequence with the convoy is pretty damn great and exciting.  Being as spoiled as I am by movies like The Raid and the Mad Max franchise, it takes a top-notch action for me to really notice and, while ths doesn't reach those high levels, it's still pretty damn effective as an action movie.  The convoy ends up leading to a callback to the first movie, where Deadpool, after literally being ripped apart by Juggernaut, starts to grow baby legs.  Once again, this ends up being a really funny scene as everyone from Dopinder, the taxi driver from the original that now wants to be an assassin, Domino, Weasel, Blind Al and even Cable all poke fun at his baby legs.  Either that or they're disgusted.  Eventually, Cable teams up with Deadpool (and his team of...just Domino actually) in order to stop Russell and the Juggernaut, who are making their way to the mutant rehab center.  Before that, however, Deadpool apologizes to Colossus for his actions earlier in the film and enlists his help along with Negasonic and Yukio's (Yukio is Negasonic's girlfriend).  Deadpool's friendship with Yukio is another really funny running gag.  They're always saying hi and bye to each other.  It's such a polite friendship when Deadpool is anything BUT polite to ANYONE, like, ever.  If there's one thing that I like about the Deadpool series is that, realistically speaking, they're relatively small-scale.  It's not a 'save the day or everybody dies' type of situation.  I mean, really, Cable comes from the future in order to stop Russell from becoming this mass murderer, but he's not a threat like Thanos (which, of course, Deadpool makes a joke about) or something like that.  It's not super serious, though Wade's journey to save Russell from becoming a monster is really surprisingly effective in terms of Wade searching for redemption through Russell.  But, anyway, the climactic action sequence is also satisfying in how it's executed, edited together and the music they use to set the violence to.  Deadpool's death scene is typically Deadpool and, naturally, very funny.  Cable, being able to jump back in time once more in order to save Wade.  And, essentially, Cable becomes part of the team and, honestly, they're clearly 'X-Men rejects', but the combination of Cable, Deadpool, Domino, Colossus, Negasonic and Yukio make for a really cool team.  And, honestly, I look forward to their journeys in the future.  The mid-credits scene with Deadpool travelling back in time saving Vanessa, Peter from the original X-Force (instead of  travelling a little more backwards in time and saving the ENTIRE TEAM), shooting the original Deadpool from X-Men Origins: Wolverine to fix the timeline and, the best one of them all, shooting Ryan Reynolds himself before he films Green Lantern (they poke fun at Batman v Superman and the DC Universe as well) is tremendous.  So, yea, I loved this movie, every solitary second of it.  It obviously isn't as fresh as the original, which was just something completely different than what we were used to, but at the same time this is still, somehow, an improvement on the original Deadpool.  It contains more of the same violence, wit and irreverence as before but it's just better this time.  The casting is tremendous.  Ryan Reynolds is born to play Deadpool, like there's no one else who embodies Deadpool as much as that guy.  Deadpool is like a supremely exaggerated version of Reynold's own personality.  Josh Brolin is such a great addition to the franchise as Cable.  I can't fucking wait to see those two play off of each other in Deadpool 3 with Deadpool being, well, Deadpool and Cable being the straight man.  Zazie Beetz as Domino, again, is just such a great addition to the franchise and, once more, I can't wait to see what they do with this motley crew.  This was such an absolute blast from beginning to end.  The sad thing is that, eventually, the quality is gonna have to drop and I don't want it to because I enjoy these damn movies so much.  The fact that this is more of the same isn't a bad thing, because it improves on what came before and makes it even more entertaining.  So, yea, this was a pretty fucking great movie.  It's not gonna be for everybody, but I would easily recommend this if you're looking for something that, still, feels different than every other superhero movie out there.  Gleefully violent and profane, great characters, great performances, surprisingly strong emotional cores, hilarious, witty dialogue, I mean, you can't really go wrong with this if you're a fan of superhero movies.  Deadpool might not be the hero we need, but he's the hero we deserve.",

            "content": "I was not a fan of the first \"Deadpool\" movie nor am I fond of the Marvel character on which it's based, but damn you, Ryan Reynolds: you've made this sequel a slam dunk. I contend that only a true fan can successfully make a movie that pleases other diehards, and Reynolds and team reach new heights of violence, comedy, and general bedlam in \"Deadpool 2.\" It's that rare follow-up that is actually better than the original.\n\nAs is the case with most blockbuster films, it's best not to know anything about the plot before discovering the movie for yourself. You can confidently read this review as I will be as vague as possible in order to avoid all spoilers.\n\nThis is a comic book movie for the comic-literate crowd. At no point does the film dumb it down for mainstream audiences: for maximum enjoyment you'll need to have a more advanced working knowledge of the superhero world. If you are a hardcore enthusiast (and in particular an X-Men junkie), you're not only going to delight in the catalog of obscure references, but you're going to want to see this movie several times to catch every single one of the often hilarious Easter eggs. I left the theater still giddy from what proved to be a ride of nearly nonstop belly laughs.\n\nI didn't think it was possible but this sequel is funnier than the original. The rapid fire pop culture nods are back with a vengeance but instead of coming across as more aggravating than amusing, they serve an actual purpose (and even when they don't, they're still funny as hell). Lively verbal banter, slapstick sight gags, hilarious opening titles...in spite of myself, the very things that irritated me about the original movie worked for me here. Get ready for put-downs of superheroes (of the Marvel and DC variety) and comic references both classic and modern (going all the way back to the vintage books of the 1960s to an up-to-the-minute \"Avengers: Infinity War\" one-liner).\n\nThe considerable magic that happens is mostly due to Reynolds and his unique brand of sarcastic snark. It was a risk for the studio to release 2016's R-rated \"Deadpool\" with its super violent, foul-mouthed lead character, but the film was such a runaway hit that it forever changed the face of superhero movies. I think its success has also given its star a newfound confidence and a bolder swagger which fits the character like a glove. Reynolds looks and feels so terrifically comfortable onscreen and while he is clearly the film's true MVP, his supporting cast also brings their A game. Josh Brolin (Cable) proves he's a force to be reckoned with when it comes to rough and tumble outlaw characters and while Julian Dennison (Russell) isn't given nearly enough to do, he's a sheer delight whenever he appears onscreen. Don't blink, because there are also some surprise cameos that had me internally hooting with excitement.\n\nNot everything comes up roses, however. There are a few too many overlong fight scenes that become increasingly tiring as they drag on and on, and the visual effects are a little corny looking (at least the film's overkill bloody violence works in its favor). But even when the story begins to fall into clich\u00e9d comic book movie convention territory, Deadpool breaks the 4th wall to directly warn the audience that there's a \"big CGI fight coming up\" or to explain away plot holes with a winking \"god, that's lazy writing.\"\n\n\"Deadpool 2\" is smarter, funnier, and more violent than its predecessor and combines all the ingredients in a way that's sure to delight fans. You really have to appreciate this movie for what it is and if you go with an open mind, you will enjoy the ride.\n\nMake sure you stay put after the final scene: you'll be treated to what's easily one of the best mid-credit stingers ever.\n\nA SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW",

I was laughing through pretty much the whole movie, you know, besides the parts all throughout concerning his wanting for suicide. But, he always has a sarcastic or dirty or just plain funny comment abut pretty much everything, and they threw in just a little bit of gay to get the audiences dying of laughter and chuckles. But some parts were very underwhelming, like the whole X-Force thing. I was hoping for an actual, legitimate team(by Deadpool's standards of course), but not for all of them but one to die(not counting Deadpool due to his near inability to die). And, I may just be stupid, but, once the collar was put on him, his cancer started to affect him. But with his healing power, all of his cells would be perfectly healthy, so shouldn't he be just fine when the collar is off? Anyway, back to the rest of the story. In the end, Deadpool puts the collar on and sacrifices himself to save Russell, but the entire reason he put it on was so that he wouldn't kill the guy that tortured him, but kill him instead, but either way, he's a killer!!! Which completely ruins the mission of trying to get him to not kill people. Though I guess it makes somewhat sense, because the only way he'll be able to see Vanessa again is to die, which is a bit different from the comics(here's the info i was talking about in my Infinity War review). In the comics, Deadpool wanted to get with Death, just as Thanos did, and the only way for him to do so would be to die. And you know how regeneration and healing goes. He can't die! But, he was supposed to die at the age of 102(I think). Thanos got jealous by, I'm sure, the fact that Deadpool just had to sit and wait for his demise, while he had to kill half of the universe. So, Thanos gave Deadpool the \"curse\" of immortality, so he could wait for eternity and never die, thus, never getting with Death. But that was way off topic. Besides the things I have already said, the movie was definitely worth splitting my sides lol. Though I could go without the disturbing image of Colossus killing baby Hitler.",

It also stars Josh Brolin as Cable and Zazie Beetz as Domino.\n\nThe story here is more complex though not as smoothly told when you compare it to the original and a lot of jokes did not land for me.\n\nI think my biggest flaw with this film is that it seems as if they are taking the character of Wade Wilson serious but everything surrounding him is a big joke. That means that whenever Deadpool (in costume) is on screen cracking jokes, it feels like a completely different character.\n\nStill there is fun to be had. Both Zazie Beetz and Josh Brolin steal the show whenever they are on screen, so much so that we needed way more of them. And Ryan Reynolds proves once again that he was born the play Deadpool.\n\nThe action is well directed, although it relies to much on CGI, and it features the best end credit scene I have ever seen.\n\nSo despite the flaws I have with it I still recommend seeing it on the big screen preferably with a packed audience.",

I do agree with other people when they say that the plot of this movie is not that original, but I personally don't care much about that as long as it is entertaining and funny to watch. \n\nOne of my favorite things about this movie, is the use of morbid humor that is used in tense scenes, I also love the well thought, not confusing, action scenes, which adds a lot to the movie. My conclusion is that is a great movie if you are looking for a funny movie to pass the time, but It's not so great if you are wanting to know the history of this anti-hero. You can always read the comic if you want to know more about him.",

The story gets interesting after an aimless and clumsy first half, but it ultimately falters by not taking a narrative opportunity to the next level. Tonally it's all over the place and that affects its pacing. Finally, it disappoints by making the mistake everyone was worried it might cause: excessive use of comedy. When the jokes are on-point, they are hilarious, but when they fall flat, they are REALLY terrible, unnecessarily long and repetitive.\"",

Or furthermore, since the post-credits scene in the first movie? I'll do you one more even-what if I told you the least interesting parts of Deadpool 2 in fact featured the same guy who was so charismatically devious three weeks ago in Avengers: infinity War? Well, for my money's worth-I'd much rather watch the Deadpool 2 that deals with the titular character wholly figuring out how to balance his sarcasm and wit with that of being a part of something bigger-whether that be with Morena Baccarin's Vanessa or his newly formed X-Force family-but for the movie to go on for long stretches pretending as if Josh Brolin's Cable is a traditional villain in the sense that this is as much his movie as it is Deadpool's and that it is he who we will come to see the merc with a mouth clash with in the unavoidable climactic third act is a disservice to the movie in general as Deadpool 2 is simply better than that. It's better than this because, for a lot of its running time, Deadpool 2 (which is really a missed opportunity in terms of a title, guys-Untitled Deadpool Sequel is where it was at) balances so well the kind of irreverent humor that is the character's trademark and upending the expectations and conventions of the super hero genre in ways that aren't as obvious as one might imagine or as easy as it could be for writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick (Zombieland) to default to, but rather Reese and Wernick as well as star Ryan Reynolds, who gets a writing credit on this follow-up, insinuate from the get-go that this isn't just going to give you what you want while upending those expectations, but rather that it's going to do this in a way you don't necessarily see coming. The writers as well as new franchise director David Leitch (John Wick, Atomic Blonde) stick to this main idea, this thesis if you will, throughout and layer in a genuine emotional pull so as to not hang their main character out to dry with little more than the same shtick we've come to expect. That said, there are plenty of laughs to be had here and viewers won't be longing for more of the old because this isn't completely more of the same, but rather there is a more intense satisfaction to be had from the bigger ambitions Reese, Wernick, and Reynolds have for the character this time around. Still, I'd be lying if I said those ambitions don't get away from them throughout the course of this neXt-level adventure.\n\nread the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com",

            "content": "Not horrible but not nearly as good as the first one.\n\nThe first DEADPOOL was not only hilarious and action-packed but also fairly shocking in how much they got away with.  A hard R, indeed.  It was wall-to-wall, pretty much from the very first second and of course through to after the credits.  It was a joy and a wonder and a blast from beginning to end.  Of course they had to make a sequel, and we don't mind because we get more of Deadpool/Ryan Reynolds and that whole world and hopefully a lot more of that magic.  Maybe we should have known there could be trouble ahead when they went with a dull predictable title instead of staying with UNTITLED DEADPOOL SEQUEL, which would have made it more fun from the get-go.  Unfortunately, the second one is at most more of the same as the first and at worst sometimes a bit of a slog.  If the first one could be considered ground-breaking, at least in the situations and language and humor that hadn't been seen like that in superhero movies, this one goes into those familiar slots then doesn't do anything more with it.  It fits in the grooves but it doesn't push like the first one did.  Too many of the jokes are forced, and paced like they're trying to hit marks.  It even takes a few minutes just to get going, which on its own isn't a crime but the first one seemed like it was in a hurry to get everything out so it started as soon as it could.  The first one seemed desperate to do everything they wanted to do, as if they might not get another chance to do this, and that if they threw in as much as they could maybe they could more, and that all of it could be taken away at any minute so they wanted to do what they could.  It was a scheme that worked and they made if not one of the best-ever superhero movies (beating even a lot of Marvel Studios' stuff), but one of the best movies of the year (at least enough to get nominated for a Golden Globe).  The pop-culture references were even funny back then, though now it's either that the new ones are predictable or old already (really, a joke about dub-step?) or that we're done with shows that rely on pop references instead of actual wit (yet they keep making THE BIG BANG THEORY).  The comics references are even a little painful, knowing that even a good is probably too deep for most of the audience, and they will never even come close to knowing or bothering to figure it out.  This one just plays it far too safe, that it knows its expectations, and it comes out far too dull than it should be.  You can only push boundaries so far, even when you already proved you could do it the first time.  Granted, it's still fun through most of it, and it's got enough story to keep it going, if not enough jokes and shock to fill it, but it's a real let-down after the majesty of the first one.\nOf course the new characters are fun.  I don't know how they could have gotten Cable any better.  He even gets feet, which he didn't often get in the comics.  That body-suit at the beginning was doofy, though, but clearly they minimized it how they could.  It's not a question of Domino being in it more, but rather that they could have made her actually part of the story.  Being a tack-on doesn't suit her but if this is just a set-up for X-Force (or whatever the next thing is), then the wait could be worth the pay-off.  And X-Force itself, after so much anxiety about those characters leading up to it: well played.\n\nReynolds does his work, just like he did before.  Not only is he in a mask for most of it -- audacious in itself by Hollywood standards -- but the parts where he doesn't he has some gross make-up, leaving as little as possible where it's just his own, handsome self.  And he did a lot of the promotion as Deadpool, which somehow is still funny.  But then it will be a disappointment to see him just as Reynolds and, even worse, in a crap movie that isn't a DEADPOOL, but oh well, he has to feed his family.  He gets points for going the extra mile.  Whatsername is a stunning presence on-screen.  For however little we get of her in this movie, it can only be too little.  It's just a shame that to get more of her we have to watch GOTHAM.",

            "content": "The murderous, irreverent, fourth wall-breaking Merc with a Mouth is back this week.  Let us all rejoice!  Isn't that how many of us felt after 2016's groundbreaking (re) debut of Deadpool?  We'll forget about the abomination we saw in X-Men Origins:  Wolverine.  A lot of people, including Ryan Reynolds, want to.  In fact, there's an amusing segment on that in the end credits of this film.  Why was the 2016 outing groundbreaking?  Only because it became the highest grossing R-rated movie in history.  Sequels in general usually have much to live up to.  Especially sequels to irrefutable smash hits.  Deadpool 2 has a lot riding on it.  Particularly, as it's the one saving grace of Fox's faltering X-Men franchise.\n\nWe find Wade Wilson/Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) up to his usual mercenary hijinks to start in a dizzying montage of murder and mayhem.  When tragedy strikes, Wade finds himself in a crippling depression that even returning X-Men allies Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead cannot break (although NTW couldn't care less).  The only thing that reaches Wade is an angry unstable young mutant, Russell Collins, who he meets on a mission reluctantly accompanying the X-Men.  What complicates matters is the sudden appearance of a tough-as-nails soldier from the future, Cable (Josh Brolin), who has a few bad intentions for the child.  With bridges to his X-Men allies burned, Wade must assemble a new team of misfits to stop the unstoppable future soldier.  But, is the child really worth the save when he only shows himself to be a huge potential menace? \n\nNow the question is does the sequel live up to its predecessor?  My answer to that is yes and no.  Deadpool was going to be a hard act to follow.  It does definitely fall short of the 2016 film.  But, it is better than some sequels in general, and many comedy sequels in particular.\n\nLet's start with what worked.  When you're talking Deadpool, you have to start with comedy.  While there's humor throughout, there are three standout segments for me.  There's a marvelously wacky tribute to James Bond openings in this film's opening credits scene.  The end credits scene of Wade righting prior wrongs is hysterical even though they're rehashed sentiments that have been expressed before.  And, by far, the best part of movie involves the consequences of the newly formed \"X-Force\" skydiving from an airplane.  That was inspired lunacy that almost made me hurt myself  laughing.\n\nMost of the supporting cast from the original film is back including Vanessa (Morena Baccarin), NTW (Brianna Hildebrand), and Weasel (T.J. Miller).  There are two new characters of note added to the mix, the previously mentioned Josh Brolin as Cable and Zazie Beets as the mutant mercenary, Domino.  Brolin has a couple of memorable physical altercations with Reynolds' Deadpool.  Beets is the standout as the \"lucky\" mutant mocked by DP and pretty much the only competent member of X-Force.\n\nBut, therein lies part of the issues I had with DP2.  While Brolin and Beets were more than adequate in their roles from an acting standpoint, neither really looked the part of their characters to me.  Yes, here's where my comic geek roots kick in.  Unlike with Brolin's Thanos in Infinity War, there was very little CGI to enhance Cable.  And while he had the demeanor and most of the aesthetic look of Cable, there's one thing Brolin can't escape.  While he got in great shape for the role, he's not an overly large guy.  Cable is huge.  As much as I wanted to, I just didn't quite buy him as this character.  It's exactly the way I've come to view Tom Hardy as Bane in The Dark Knight Rises.  Getting buff doesn't add inches to your height or make a smaller body frame into a hulk. \n\nAs for Beets, let me preface this by saying my thoughts on her appearance have nothing to do with race.  I'm not even sure if Marvel has ever revealed Domino's nationality.  The point is that no matter what that might be, she has a very unique look that could have been remedied by a makeup artist.  Honestly, I've seen better aesthetic renditions of Domino by cosplayers and actresses in fan made films.  And note I would be saying this whether Domino was played by an African-American, Caucasian, Asian, Indian, or whatever actress was hired for the part.  Do whatever you want with the hair, but, give me the chalk white skin with the black eye patch.  That's Domino.\n\nBut, those are relatively minor complaints.  My major one is that DP2 really did suffer from a common sequel weakness.  It tried too hard to be bigger and better.  The jokes, while still funny, didn't hit with the same impact.  I didn't think not having Tim Miller on board as the director for this one would matter as much as it did.  But, I felt DP2 was put together as more of a string of incidents for Ryan Reynolds to riff from more than it was an actual story.  The writing in the first film felt much tighter.  \n\nI complained in my review of the first DP that the first film had fairly vanilla main villains who were adequate, but, nothing to write home about.  Well, they were the gold standard compared to Russell Collins and his partner (who I'll get around to shortly).  The fact that Russell is a kid automatically gives him plot armor because you know Wade wasn't likely to gut or behead him no matter how evil and obnoxious he was.  I know the kid had reasons for why he was the way he was, but, it didn't make him any less annoying or more interesting.  I just wasn't feeling this kid at all.  His attempts to be \"gangsta\" were cringeworthy at best.\n\nLet's get to the sidekick.  For all you Juggernaut fans out there, the character makes his first appearance since X-Men:  The Last Stand.  That's the good news.  The bad?  You still don't have a version to be proud of.  Although, to be fair, DP2 does provide the true reason the character wears that large helmet.  But, as you would expect in this type of movie, Juggernaut is basically (and literally in his final battle sequence) the butt of a joke.  Plus the Juggernaut/Colossus battle has some shoddy CG at times.  Again, to be fair, this could have been intentional given DP's statement prior to the fight.\n\nFrom what I understand, Ryan Reynolds had major input in the writing of DP2.  If that's the case, that might have been a mistake.  Even though the film makes stabs at providing some dramatic heft, it was a little weird paired with the often sophomoric comedy.  And that's the other thing.  Many of the jokes in DP2 weren't much different than DP.  Oh, I was still amused, but, there was something that felt a little off and flat to me this time around.  Jokes didn't have the same kind of bite.  The narrative was a little bit all over the place.  Want proof?  Cable had a certain motivation for pursuing Russell throughout the film.  Once that issue is resolved and he is able to go back to his timeline to a future he helped to create, he suddenly decides not to?  What was the purpose of you being in the current timeline in the first place if you aren't going to go back?  That decision just turns out to be a convenient plot device for DP's shenanigans during the end credits scenes.\n\nI wanted to like DP2 more than I did.  I really tried to.  I twisted myself into all types of crazy contortions to try to see it differently.  But, the bottom line is, the magic just wasn't there for me this time around.  This is a pale comparison to the 2016 film which I will now call a classic .  It's not awful.  There is enough of the DP zaniness to say that it's not a total waste of time.  But, it's still disappointing.  Much like Horrible Bosses and Sinister, DP is cursed with a  watchable, but, mediocre sequel after crafting a tremendous opening act.  That's something at least.  Most follow-ups fall well short of even that.  I give DP2 a thumbs up, but, not resoundingly so.",

            "content": "It should come as no surprise that Deadpool, a shocking hit that came out of nowhere, got a sequel.  What is surprising, is how clever and successful it is.  Comedy sequels are usually terrible - the nadir of popular cinema and all that.  Deadpool 2 defies this trend and improves upon the original, making it either on par with or superior to its predecessor.  I've said before that Deadpool was always Ryan Reynold's gambit to lose.  Needless to say, he owns it and every other line he spouts is quotable, allowing for multiple intoxicated viewings with your friends.  Josh Brolin shows up as Cable and it works better than you'd think.  Cable is a bit maligned these days by comic book purists as a hangover from the 90's - an edgelord anti-hero that overstayed his welcome.  But then again, he was always so much damn fun.  He's a perfect foil to Deadpool and yes you can insert your Thanos joke here, as does the Merc with the Mouth.  (Seriously Brolin is in GODDAMN everything this year, and I'm okay with that!)  There are some other great newcomers, such as Julian Dennison as a new teenage mutant and the focus of the plot.  His interplay with Deadpool rides the line between absurd and tragically insightful.  Zazie Beetz won me over on her take as Domino.  Yes, she does play the sexy superhero, but her comedic timing comes off as more cute than ribald - another foil to foulmouthed Wade Wilson.  \n\nMorena Baccarin returns for a smaller role but leaves a mark.  Yes, that most dreaded and dated trope of \"Women in Refrigerators\" returns here.  But Deadpool 2 parodies, subverts, and then undoes it in dramatic fashion.  And you see, that's the trick about this movie.  Deadpool always seems to be in on the joke and makes sure you are too.  It never quite becomes the thing it parodies, unlike Kick-Ass 2.  David Leitch applies the same sure and brisk direction that he gave John Wick and Atomic Blonde.  It succeeds as an action movie almost as much as it does as a screwball comedy.  Odds are you've probably seen this, but in case you haven't, it's time to drop those drawers and get busy.  Whoa.  Did I just say that?",

            "content": "Deadpool 2: What the?-?\nThere are a lot of people that find Deadpool to be one of their favorite heroes- at least comically, like?-?in a funny way. Deadpool 2 reminds me of Spaceballs. I don't ever feel like I have to take the film seriously though serious matters arise in the film which are undercut by a lot of cussing and random commentary. It's tough to not like any of the characters in the film. Plus, a lot of Deadpool 2 is like watching Dan Forden appearing from the side of the screen to say \"Toasty!\" after a fierce upper cut in Mortal Kombat?-?though as an actual system propelling all aspects of a full-length feature film.\n\nFirefist is right. I've never seen a plus-size super hero. Weasel is really funny. Domino, ha! Shout out to X-factor, and their serious replacements? Deadpool 2 is a funny film that slaps away serious topics by embracing and making light of them. After watching Deadpool 2, I feel like I'm done watching a draft of the potential angles for a film more than feeling like I've come away from a complete project (which?-?I guess, is the point of Deadpool 2?). Honestly, my mental reaction after watching Deadpool 2 is like Mary Elizabeth Winstead's reaction at the end of the Swiss Army Man.\n\n-K.D.\n\nOverall: 6.312/10\n\nP.S. Yeah, I know. Everyone's a critic. Conversation is good. I'm not holding anything against Ryan Reynolds either. It's just?-?walking to my car, all that comes to mind is Mr. D from School of Life when I think of Ryan Reynolds?-?and then Blake Lively. The Age of Adaline. Okay, we're done here. Enough of the gush.\n\nIf you're into Poetry and other bits of creativity, check out my Instagram: @Dufreshest.",

            "content": "Noon had just passed and I was near the theater.  Why not go see a movie?  It'll be free, and fun.\n\nOkay.  It won't exactly be free because I drove my incredibly cool (and old) truck to get here, and gas isn't free.  And that toll booth charges me seventy-five cents each time I go through it.  And my truck doesn't keep itself full of oil (it leaks a lot) and anti-freeze (it also leaks).  Someone has to refill the reservoirs every few days.  Me.  Good old birthday coming soon me.\n\nBut the movie was free, sorta.  I signed up for Movie Pass, and it costs me $9.95 per month.  But I can watch as many movies as I want with this pass.  At any theater that accepts it (which is most, probably).  I just swipe my card and they give me a ticket.  The ticket even says that they charged my credit card (it looks just like one, with my name on it and all) $8.15.  Cool.\n\nI arrived early and I was hungry, so I ordered some Deluxe Nachos.  Medium.  And water.  I wanted a beer, but it was the afternoon and I didn't want to start drinking this early, or deal with the effects, or consequences, etc.  \n\nJonathan brought me my food and it was delicious.  I hate olives, so I asked him to leave them off.  But the jalapeno peppers were amazing.  And lettuce.  And tomatoes.  And cheese.  D.  Lish.  Us.\n\nJust as the previews started rolling, I was done with my lunch.  There was still food on the plate, but my tummy was no longer talking to me, and my taste buds had enough sensory opportunities.  I felt okay about leaving some of the food behind.  The Cinema Caf\u00e9 made $11.47 during my visit, so I don't feel bad about watching a movie for free.\n\nI sat in the fifth row (out of five or six), next to the wall.  About two-thirds of the seats in this auditorium were empty, including the two to my right.  I never looked at the girl who sat three seats over, but I heard her laughing.  A lot.  And once she said to her date, \"I don't know why you're not laughing.\"  I was laughing, but I wasn't her date.  I wouldn't have minded, but, er, no such luck.  Still, I wondered why he wasn't laughing aloud.  Moron.\n\nRyan Reynolds is hilarious as the superhero Deadpool, or supervillain, or X-men (in training).  He makes jokes about himself, about other people, and about the viewers who are watching the film.  By the way, he was also one of its writers, so the humor comes naturally to him.  For example, he mocks the movie \"Green Lantern,\" joking that it shouldn't have been created, even though it was he who starred in it.  Funny!  He talks about the Oscar watchers as he says weird stuff related to other movies, slowly dying, fading away...and then not dying yet.  Funny stuff, mocking his and other dying scenes, joking on himself and his need to be recognized for his acting artistry.  Humor outside of the storyline.  Ha!\n\nZazie Beetz as Domino is very cute.  And she is so darn lucky.  That's her mutant power.  Luck.  Probably a dozen times, when she is sure to have something bad happen, it doesn't.  Instead, something completely unpredictable happens to allow her to escape sure destruction, and death.  And she's cute.\n\nAnd then there is Juggernaut.  Big.  Powerful.  Easily swayed to do the bidding of a kid who gives him extra food.  Remember the part of the movie where Deadpool tells the kid to find one person and make him your friend.  Well, the kid does that, and wahlah, the storyline works...if you suspend reality and pretend that all this mutant stuff is real, and forget about asking how they got back to the orphanage to wreak havoc and vengeance on the abusers who worked there.  Just pretend.\n\nNow, a few critical comments here.  Lotsa cursing.  If you don't like the F-bomb, then tough, though it's funny when Deadpool gets Colossus to say it at the end.  Lotsa weird pedophile jokes and insinuations, and stereotypes of males who work with boys, and anal sex (reflect on Juggernaut's ending, literally his end, the shocking butt-scene), and penis jokes (think of what you first thought when the old blind lady was asked to rub his sore legs and she got disgusted.  Yep, adult humor, and very inappropriate for kids, but okay (apparently) for adults when coming from the mouth of a mutant like Deadpool.  \n\nWatch the movie.  And don't leave when the credits start.  Of course.  You know that.  There is always more in a Marvel movie.  Extra stuff.  And hints at another movie, and its main character.  Yay!\n\nLook.  Deadpool 2 is hilarious, and rude, insensitive, disgusting and ahhhhhh!  But, I laughed a lot, and I bet that you will too.  Maybe.  If you're weird and like the crazy antics that made the first movie, Deadpool, require a sequel.  Oh, a sequel?  Will there be a third in this franchise?  Maybe.  Hey, did you know that the makers of this movie, 21st Century Fox, is now owned by Disney?  Yep!  Disney, of you know, princesses and cute animation and happy endings (not like you saw in the preview of the comedy Muppet-like movie office scene, OMG, disgusting and funny).  So, is there a market for a third, or will the Deadpool character find himself in other Marvel movies, in a supporting role, or just there for the giggles?  I wonder.  Will X-Force re-emerge, with Domino (very cute), and Cable (very strong), and Deadpool (very funny)?  And that stupid weasel of a cab-driver?  Time will tell (that's a joke, by me, because now Deadpool has a timetravel device that Negasonic Teenage Warhead, the first openly LGBTQ marvel character depicted in a film, fixed for him.\n\nQuestion:  Is there any irony to the scene where Juggernaut became dead in a pool?  Deadpool?",

I just don't really like Reynolds or the character he's playing.  He is surrounded by actors and characters I did like though, and the action sequences are executed well.

After Wade Wilson loses everything, he discovers that he can still be a force for good and help someone, in this case, a kid. Now he must protect this kid from Cable, played by Josh Brolin, and other enemies. The story takes a while to get going but it does eventually and the movie is essentially around two hours of jokes that mostly land. Visually, the movie is average and some of the special effects could have used more work. Ryan Reynolds does a good job as Deadpool and the rest of the cast does fine. The action is also fine if still a little inconsequential. Deadpool 2 is a solid outing in the X-Men franchise though it doesn't reach the heights of Logan.",

            "content": "\"I'm Batman\"\n\n'Deadpool 2' is a massive improvement over the first in terms of film making and having more freedom to go balls to the wall. Not feeling so contained. Having more laughs and soul in this serious drama about the 'F' word. Well that's what Deadpool thinks. A lot more ruthless when referencing other movies or other source materials surrounding this movie.\n\nNow my main issue from the first movie is how colorless and bland the film making was. Something lacking or anything stuck out as memorable in terms of visual comedy. This time it's directed by David Leitch, best known for John Wick and Atomic Blonde, who added a lot of his mystical tricks into this. How Leitch filmed the action scenes was slick and flowed smoothly. Especially in the musical numbers (played for comedy) that plays along during those sequences as a parody for blockbusters trying to be serious. Also not forgetting the truck chase.\n\nRyan Reynolds returns as the mouth taking anti-hero, but more crude and plenty of fourth wall breaking to go around. It's clear from interviews and the behind the scenes that Reynolds is having an absolute blast playing this role. Probably the most fun he's ever had. Taking past failures into account for humor and doesn't waste time to erase them. Reynolds once again captures the character in spirit through his sharp line delivery and comedic timing. But also giving the character heart by showing a softer side, which stops him from being annoying.\n\nJosh Brolin is having such a great year it's unbelievable. First 'Infinity War', than this, and Sicario 2. I've never seen an actor who's been in three movies within three months back to back. His physical work and keeping up the straight man phase throughout also adds to the comedy. Never cracking a smile and keeping up the 'tough guy' appearance. He commands the scene whenever he appears on screen. Brolin delivers a great performance, what's new?\n\nWhile the achievements deserves it's praise, but please keep in mind it's not perfect by any mean, like a masterpiece level. It's freaking stupid if you ask me. Some of the CGI looked a bit noticeable and since there's a lot of jokes, not all land. While all the actors played the parts well, small or big, were excellent either way and have such great chemistry with each other. Unfortunately the same couldn't be said about T.J Miller who was one of the worst parts of the movie. The running gag of \"You look like an avocado had sex-\" or \"you look like Freddy Krueger face-fucked a topographical map\" was never funny in the first place. Glad he's screen time was short. I really hope they kill his character off in the next one, which seems more possibly if you heard the recent news surrounding the actor. Or knowledge his absence.\n\nOther than that, Deadpool 2 is an extremely enjoyable film that succeeds and falls short in certain areas. If you like the first, then you will or probably have enjoyed this. For me, I was laughing and smiling for 2 hours.\n\nOverall rating: Zazie Beetz and Rob Delaney are national treasures.",

            "content": "Honestly I don't know waht kind of star to give it. I kind of wished I waited until it came onto video. So, first one was okay. Saw it with my moms and sister and they seemed to like it. I just thought it was okay. This one I almost didn't watch but had a couple of hours to waste so went to see it. It was more of the same. Less funny moments than the original for me, but there were some cute moments and lol moments. Didn't like how it began (a sort of flashback, but wasn't necessary). One review said they kept waiting for the movie to actually start (which is what I felt). All actors were good. Having the Maori kid in the movie was great. but he was the same character from \"Hunt for the Wilderpeople\". Which isn't necessarily a bad thing but felt like treading old ground. Domino was fun and would like to see more of her. A lot of in-jokes for the nerds. Cheapshot jokes too. There wasn't a proper Stan Lee cameo so that was a bummer. Also, not an aftercredit sequence just a midcredit one (which was actually fun and entertaining). I still want to see Fabian Nicieza, Rob Liefeld and Stan Lee in a deadpool cameo commenting on him being a moron and stan lee says, Don't look at me, I didn't create this guy. If you like the original, you'll probably like this one. So watch it if you like it, avoid it if you don't. If you're on the defense, wait for it to come on TV. Now for spoiler stuff: I think my main problem is that it opens with a major tragedy, which lessened the impact of the jokes, because he's supposed to be all depressed and shit, yet he still acts corny. The death of a major character took away the heart of the story for me. I liked the actress and I liked her character. Considering the fact that Marvel is terrible with its female characters, she was one I actually liked. So, killing her took it away. As a matter of fact, I thought she was going to become Mrs. Deadpool. But the other femaile characters are still nice and Domino was a welcomed new face. Cable took too long to show up. I thought it was going to be quicker. It also had a good diversity of cast. TJ Miller wasn't that funny. Some of the jokes were retreats and some of the plotlines were not that great. The scene where Deadpool dies at the end was too much, because, all they had to do was take off the collar, instead of having Cable waste his time travel for something that they can easily fix. MONDAY MORNING FILMMAKER: The movie went into a different direction than I thought. Since there was time traveling I thought they were going to go back and save vanessa (which they kind of did but as a throwaway gag). I thought the storyline should have been vanessa and deadpool have a kid and he is a superbaby, but similar plotline with the Maori kid and Cable comes back to kill Deadpool's kid. Hilarity ensues. The time when deadpool dies, I thought that Cable was going to learn when Vanessa died, set his watch to go back to that time period and Cable save Vanessa from dying. Deadpool gets another chance to go to Fire Fist, and this time helps him and not turn him into a bad guy. There needed to be an aftercredit sequence. It should be Deadpool meeting Hugh Jackman, trying to make a deal with getting him in the movie as Wolverine, finally Deadpool tells him, \"and it's going to be a musical\". Hugh Jackman is now interested. Or something like that",

            "content": "Strengths: The first Deadpool worked so well because it totally captured the spirit of the character. The second one continues that. Ryan Raynolds (Wade Wilson/Deadpool) shines again as the foul-mouthed mercenary. It's clear he was dying to bring the right Deadpool to the big screen, as he is perfect for the role again. His banter with his co-stars is great and some of the jokes thrown out, like calling Cable (Josh Brolin) \"Thanos,\" are excellent. The supporting cast is just as good, with Terry Crews (Bedlam), Bill Skarsbard (Zeitgeist), and Rob Delany (Peter) being fantastic in small roles. The real show stealer was Zazie Beetz (Domino). She's a star on Atlanta, but hopefully this got way more eyes on her. She was often the best part of the movie and her sibling like chemistry with Reynolds was top notch. Those two, along with Brolin, shined. The action was great, the soundtrack worked, and we also got an awesome surprise cameo, as well as a fun appearance from the Juggernaut.\n\nWeaknesses: Some of the more emotional aspects of the movie didn't click. Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) has something very emotional happen to her early on. However, when the film goes back to her for certain things later on, it kind of misses the mark and drags the film down. With so many new people involved, a few of the original cast members were shoved aside. Along with Baccarin, TJ Miller (Weasel), Brianna Hildebrand (Negasonic Teenage Warhead) and Stefan Kapicic (Colossus) all felt rather underutilized. \n\nOverall: A great sequel that is probably better than the original. Domino is a scene stealer and if they do a third installment, she needs to be a huge factor. The jokes mostly hit, the story was solid, and they made great use of most of the characters involved. A winner.",

Lot of fourth wall breaking, and even a great score from Tyler Bates. It's everything you could ever want from a Deadpool movie! Where this movie sort of loses me, and it's a nitpick, is when it becomes sad, yes a Deadpool movie has some depressing moments, and it's understandable, but I didn't really come to a Deadpool movie to see dark imagery and sad scenes, I came to have complete fun. However that is a nitpick for this movie is still great, Cable is a standout played beautifully by Josh Brolin; yet he is very underused and not used to his full potential. If you worried about the trailers showing you an Avengers like team up with Deadpool leading them, you have nothing to be concerned about since its nothing like that, it's still a fun Deadpool film. Deadpool doesn't really do anything \"bad-ass\" in this film, he's very funny but doesn't do anything that stands out really. A very excellent entry to the Deadpool franchise, but by the end of it, I wasn't asking for a Deadpool 3, not because I didn't want one, but because this movie feels like a conclusion for his story.",

It has Jokes, gore, and most importantly action that is litered throughout the film, but although this sequel is better in almost every aspect I find its predecessor utimately funnier. If there was a problem with anything in this film, it would have to be the CGI. Not only is it easily unrealistic, but it takes the audience out of the moment when you can tell that it is a fake person/thing on your screen. I know it must be difficult to make the Juggernaut and Colossus fight, but with the animations, and action in the fight pulled off beautifully, it comes off as lazy when they look fake next to the other actors. The bread and butter of this film is action and jokes, with jokes thrown in to make the action as fun as humanly possible; ultimately it works, with the choreography and stunts extremely fun to watch keeping the viewer locked in to see how they pull off each fight scene. The last objection I have to this sequel would be how it made me leave the theater wanting more, but not in the good way. With films like Avengers Infinity War, Mad Max Fury Road, and The Wolf of Wall street, to name a few, the one thing these movies have in common would be that i didn't want them to end. When deadpool finishes, and the film cuts to credits I feel almost cheated with the majority of the movie leaving a bad after taste in the back of my mind; I enjoyed the movie nonetheless, but the movie is missing something that I can't quite figure out what it is. Deadpool 2 is great sequel that capitalizes on the sucess of the first with more action, more characters, and just more deadpool being deadpool. Although most of you have seen it, you should see this when you have the chance.",

It's entertaining in the same ultraviolent, frenetic, gross, crude, shocking way as the first movie - only more so. Ryan Reynolds is very good in the role with exquisite comedic timing and likeable personality. Julian Dennison brings youthful and quirky playfulness to the cast - essentially a more acidic version of his role in Hunt for the Wilderpeople. The story ultimately has a good message - ironically, about family. And below the surface hubris of Deadpool, there is a soft heart that wants to be loved. The humour is often very funny and the allusions to pop culture come fast and furious. The action is amazing with superb special effects. Even with all the good things about it, though, it still doesn't make for a great movie. It's entertaining, but the positive message that is pushed, particularly at the end, doesn't really have much impact. In fact, everything happens so fast and the movie is stuffed with so much that it leaves you exhausted and feeling like you've eaten too much rather than just finishing a satisfying meal. The best thing about is is that it lampoons what has now become ubiquitous superhero worship and it does that with reasonable success. If you see it, just don't expect too much.",

The first half of the movie was a hodgepodge of happenings, with no apparent purpose or connection.  Then out of nowhere, this villain appears, literally out of thin air.  Eventually it all comes together to make a really decent second half, but by then it had already lost me and never really reeled me back.  Regarding the writing, people criticized Ragnarok for its humor content.  While Deadpool is meant to have the humor in abundance, it gets wearisome when 95% of Reynold's lines are meant to be humorous or sarcastic.  And I'm just not sure I was sold on Brolin as Cable.",

My problem here is the poor character writing, which is where Ryan Reynolds may have wanted to step away and hire a professional. It felt like all the dialogue was spoken by one character - Ryan Reynolds himself. I enjoy Deadpool's jokes, but why does every other character have to talk like him? Most out of place was Firefist's antics - the audience went silent when he did his little rope-pulling trick, which was just so far out of the character and moment that I had flashbacks of Paul Feig's Ghostbusters.\n\nImproved from the last film are more memorable villains, one of which I will not spoil, but who is an X-Men favorite. Firefist and the Headmaster are both villains, but at each other's throat. The Headmaster is brief, but that he's played by Eddie Marsan breathes layers of life into the character that the first Deadpool - who was that guy again? - was sorely missing.\n\nSome may be disappointed, but perhaps the boldest choice of any superhero film was made shortly after an airborne attack to rescue another character held hostage in a moving truck. Here come the newly assembled parachuting X-Force, and I won't say what happens next, but my head nearly fell off laughing so hard. \n\nSo yeah, there's some things to enjoy here, there's other things that leave a sore spot, but all-in-all it's a fun movie, not much more.",

            "content": "Quick Review: After the overwhelming success that the first Deadpool brought to get modern audiences into the titular character, there was some much needed criticism that making the sequel moving forward that would hopefully improve on whatever faults that the first film would reasonably have (as no film is perfect). But with director Tim Miller unfortunately leaving due to creative differences, it seemed the sequel even with Ryan Reynolds (who's been doing a damn great job playing the character of being \"God's Perfect Idiot\") and the films original screenwriters would be in a bit of a pickle. But with the production unit person behind the John Wick films helming the directing mantle and going full on with Cable and his time traveling comic book arc (and some pretty funny and decent marketing material from FOX), it seemed like the film would be in good hands to release and maybe improve heavily from the last films faults. But unfortunately i'm here to say that for me, the film is while slightly in a lot of aspects better than the first film; just unfortunately feels more of the same and sadly not almost in a good way. Now despite saying this where the film does do well much like the first film which is a fantastically acted cast (with no duh Ryan Reynolds doing a great job as always but also this time with Josh Brolin and especially Zazie Beetz playing Domino), this time a much more decently outline story, much more better chemistry and energetic fun with the characters and having the script give them all a decent moment to shine, and definitely tone wise and flair wise makes a marking style thanks to director David Leitch's involvement. Unfortunately though, a lot of what made the first Deadpool not work is also in this film almost lazily due to a script that still is unnecessarily dramatized and adds the wrong layer of connection to Deadpool and to his arc, humour that while does work hits also almost sadly majorly adds a lot of unnecessary padding, some of the side characters feeling really pointlessly underdeveloped when they where interesting enough to do something with, and even the action feeling despite clearly well directed and practical editing wise felt disjointed and missed a lot of the one take action of films David Leich did and worked on to help make the action fresh and unique. \n\nSo overall I'm really unfortunately sad to say the sequel didn't do a whole lot to improve the first film but thankfully not do enough to damage what it did (and made up for some of the first films lackluster direction and action set-pieces) and at least slightly improve upon it. I really had wished the film had done more to do well by Deadpool but for what it stands we still have a fun and decent ride that at least unlike the first film doesn't completely overstay its welcome. Whether a sequel will be made (that isn't X-Force) is undecided but as a fan of Deadpool still, I'm really hoping they can continue to build and hey even get me to really get behind their next storyline (One thing I will not deny though is that the mid-credit sequence to this film was incredibly fantastic and is something no one should miss out, it had me surprised and laugh out loud more than i care to admit)",

What the second movie does better, is that it focuses less on sex, revenge, murder, etc. and more on the sentimental value of the relationship with his girlfriend and the relationship he has with others.  The film is hilarious, but it does not make too much of an effort with the gags and other jokes.  There is more situational comedy rather than Deadpool himself waiting for a \"mic drop\" every time he cracks a joke.  The second Deadpool continue to usher in the successful use of the rated \"R\" superhero franchise.  How violent the second movie is, shows why it was successful in the first place.  \n\nP.S.

The story is terrific, not only giving a solid foundation for various plot points that all blend together to make an excellent, lighthearted yet dark storyline, but also managing to achieve this whilst breaking the fourth wall. The characters and cast are all excellent, adding a smoothie blend of different personalities and emotions that all contrast each other in a unique but oddly satisfying way. Character development (particularly for Deadpool), however, is rather flat in the first half of the film, but is forgivable as the characters evolve into a more complex state in the latter half.\u00a0The visuals were mostly stunning, aside from a few clips where there seemed to be more of a cartoonish look to the generated props. The jokes were mostly hilarious, adding a great sense of lighthearted, perverted humor that also allowed for several pop culture references, while still managing to stick to a rather dark tone throughout the movie. The only real criticism that can be stated is the abrupt type of transition that Cable experiences, going from the villain to the side kick in a few lines, which feels unrealistic. Overall, I feel that this movie is generally better than the first, remaining independent from the prior installment yet still managing to be just as fun as the first, if not more so. This film doesn't just serve as a fantastic addition to a must-see movie, but it has \u00a0also proven itself to be a masterpiece on its own, presenting itself to be a classic anti-hero film that anyone and everyone should take the time to see.",

This second installment in the sarcastic loud-mouthed superhero's series is a bit of a surprise, since sequels rarely conjure up the same passion and fandom as the original film. Much like 22 Jump Street, Deadpool 2 succeeds in its self-awareness. Multiple self-deprecating jokes about lazy writing and some surprisingly bold decisions with regard to the story make this sequel, in some ways, more memorable, and certainly more unique in its genre, than the original. Deadpool is a standard superhero film with some R-rated humor baked into its crust whereas Deadpool 2 is a superhero film distancing itself from the formula. Without this distinction, Deadpool 2 would not be worth two hours of anyone's time.\n\nLittle can be discussed with regard to the story without leading to spoilers (not that a film of this nature demands or deserves much analysis). Many of the jokes will not age well, and audiences may soon tire of Ryan Reynolds's brand of humor in general.

The story, inspired by the comic books characters, has Deadpool teaming up with a group of rogue mutants, the eye-rollingly named X-Force, to protect a teenage boy with supernatural abilities from the time-traveling mutant, Cable, played by Josh Brolin, hot off the heels of his evil villain turn as Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War. (Apparently there is a shortage of actors eligible to play evil villains in Hollywood these days.) The energetic pacing and super fun soundtrack are definitely the hallmarks of director David Leitch (Atomic Blonde), but make no mistake - this film is all about Reynolds and his rapid fire string of belly laughs, amping up all the snark and audience-addressing humor of the original film ten-fold. Thanks to exceptionally clever writing (Reynolds was a co-writer) and a heartfelt story with some surprising (and some really gruesomely funny) plot twists, this is the rare movie sequel that improves upon a really good original.

The biggest thing that the first movie had going for it was, that no one knew what to expect with it, with this one, it was going to be extremely difficult to top what the first one brought from a comedic aspect and from a tone aspect. One of the biggest issues that I had with the movie, is that there was little to no backstory on Cable considering how big of a character he is in the Xmen universe as I am not that well versed in all of the Xmen stuff and mythos. Secondly, I thought the first one, had so much more emotion tied to it, I know it was an origin movie, but you saw the torture and pain he had to go through to become this almost hero, sometimes good guy, and this one, there really wasn't much of that anywhere in the film. The whole bit at the end where Deadpool uses the time device to change some stuff, I'm kinda confused with some of the things he changed, some of the events make sense and then some are just kinda confusing. Hopefully there will be another solo outing for Mr. Pool aside from the rumored X-Force movie, and if there is, lets see what Ryan can come up with.

More screen time could be given to other characters instead of Deadpool to develop the characters and put more effort in making  connection in the story. It would be more interesting if they give more explanation about the future and why the kid killed Cable's family. The only characters that I enjoy are Cable and Domino.

The punchlines are ridiculous and the amount of cameos and references to pop culture is hysterical. The end credit scenes are the best I've ever seen. Also they played Bangarang by Skrillex twice Things that dragged the movie down: The tone of this movie, at times, turns serious. Having serious and sad moments for a goofy character like Deadpool is somewhat of a turn off. They also touch base on how depressing Cable's story is and while it helps explains the character's motive, doesn't match the tone of a comical movie. While the movie is very funny, it uses some of the same jokes from the first DP and drags on at points. Going forward I think Ryan Reynolds DP should stick to cameos and short videos and not feature length films. He's a master at short term jokes.",

D2 does feel a little overly long (where I felt the original was a little short) but it nevertheless captures a weird dynamic of crass humor and positive messaging. Ryan Reynolds reprises his role as Deadpool, and continues to be a perfect fit for the katana-wielding antihero. There's so much meta-humor and goofiness that there's almost a gag every scene, or sometimes multiple piling up on each other, but the nice thing is that the humor remains relatively fresh. The post credits sequence is particularly hilarious! A few jokes didn't really hit me as much as others in the audience, though. Josh Brolin as Cable is excellent, a really great addition to the cast, and so is Zazie Beetz as the comedically lucky sidekick. In fact, I felt the cast overall simply had more personality and character as compared to the first, so that's a positive improvement. Deadpool isn't necessarily a giant step up from the original, but more par for the course. It feels kind-of like a Part 2 rather than a true sequel. That being said it's shocking, surprising, and over-the-top in the all the right ways.",

            "content": "When the original deadpool released in 2016, I adored it. I found this movie, while flawed, an absolute blast to watch. It wasn't an extremely well made movie, but the comedic aspects of the movie were so smart that I couldn't help but notice new jokes every time I watched the movie. Of course the direction in the original deadpool wasn't great. The action wasn't consistently paved across the entire movie and I'd always hated the origin story part of the movie for some reason. I feel deadpool isn't entertaining when he doesn't have his powers, which I thought wouldn't have been a problem in the sequel since we've already been through his origin story. Sadly though, there were moments with deadpool powerless even in the sequel and it's my biggest flaw with the movie.\nDeadpool 2 is the sequel to the hugely successful Deadpool which came out in 2016 and yet again stars Ryan Reynolds and T.J Miller as well as new cast members such as Zazie Beetz and Josh Brolin. The story follows Deadpool who, after his life starts to fall apart, decides to become a superhero. He ends up crossing paths with a troubled child who is being hunted by Josh Brolin's Cable, and so throughout this movie deadpool tries to be good and protect the child from Cable. The plot may make this movie sound a lot more childish than the first. However, even with his own good objectives in this sequel, Deadpool is still no role model. Ryan Reynolds yet again owns the role of Wayde Wilson and makes sure to land almost all the jokes that the script has to offer. The comedic writing is by far the best thing this movie has going for it. From the crude gags to the absurd amounts of cleverly written pop culture references, Deadpool has never felt this close the comics. This movie now also has a great villain with Cable who does his job of allowing Deadpool to make fun of him as well as having understandable motivations. While this movie is a blast to watch, there was a part of the movie that bored me and reminded me of the origin story in the original. This segment involves a prison and is going to be frustrating upon rewatch since deadpool during this segmant is powerless which makes the movie far less fun. Also, the movie has a wierd pace whereby lots of unexpected things happen in the beginning and the movie doesn't really properly begin till about 15-20 minutes into it, which brings me on to the first act, which is quite clunky and I struggled to realise where this movie was actually going since it was branching into so many different directions at once. As for the movies new director who also directed John Wick, an extremely well made action movie, David Leitch brings new things to the table with deadpool 2 and manages to use his trademark action style throughout the movie. Also, Leitch even more tries to make the movie more emotional this time around and it surprisingly works quite well. Deadpool character is developed a lot more in this movie than the last one and it works great. Overall, this movie was great as a comedy but as a movie it does have its flaws. This could be better than the original however for me it's down to how funny it is in comparison instead of how well made the movie actually is.",

            "content": "It took the leaked release of the Deadpool test footage, and the ensuing enthusiastic fan response, before Fox finally decided to invest in a big screen, R-rated superhero movie. The result was 2016's Deadpool, a huge smash and proof that a lucrative audience will turn out for more adult-oriented, outrageous, grisly versions of comic book movies. Because of Deadpool, we finally got an R-rated Logan that proved to be an outstanding swan song for Hugh Jackman's iconic hero. Now Deadpool is getting the spotlight he has earned with a big, splashy summer release, but with success come expectations. Can it live up to the ever-increasing hype? In short: if you were a fan of the original, you'll be happy enough, because Deadpool 2 isn't much more than the sum of its zany parts.\n\nWade Wilson a.k.a. Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) is killing bad guys for hire and considering starting a family with the love of his life, Vanessa (Morena Baccarin). Trouble emerges when Cable (Josh Brolin) travels from the future to kill a rebellious, troubled young mutant teenager, Russell (Julian Dennison), who will one day grow up to be a monstrous villain. Deadpool reaches out for help and forms an elite squad of determined heroes, notably the luck-assisted Domino (Zazie Beetz). Can Deadpool save the kid, save the day, save the future, and save himself from incessant fourth wall breaks?\n\nI was worried that a Deadpool sequel would fall into some of the same detractions that a Guardians of the Galaxy sequel did, and this is still applicable. Deadpool, much like the original 2014 Guardians film, was a breath of fresh air and a far looser, weirder, funkier super hero movie with a nose-thumbing, prankish attitude. We didn't know what to expect from a Deadpool movie and now we do, and with that knowledge comes an anticipated formula of checklists to adhere to, and so any resulting sequel will invariably feel less fresh. It happened with Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2 so to compensate James Gunn concentrated on fleshing out secondary characters into people you might shed a tear over. Deadpool 2 doesn't bother because Deadpool 2 doesn't take anything really seriously. That's one of the hallmarks of the series and also one of the aspects that holds it back. There can never be a sense of stakes with a gleeful, fourth wall-breaking cartoon of a character who bounces back like Wile E. Coyote. The sequel introduces a sense of stakes with a startling turn in the first ten minutes of the movie, but by the end, even that will be corrected so that the Deadpool universe returns to stasis. The limitation of the Deadpool universe is that nothing feels meaningful or even ambitious. The movie wants to be a cheeky, transgressive good time and it achieves this single goal.\n\nThe appeal of Deadpool 2 is still its comedic voice and unpredictability. The laughs will be frequent and there are some subversive and unexpected directions that fully take advantage of the R-rating and the anarchic, nasty comic spirit of the franchise. The formation of the X-Force team and how their first big mission plays out had me howling with laughter. The meta humor commenting on the nature of super hero movies, as well as the film industry in general, begins with the very opening image (a nod to another successful R-rated super hero movie of last year) until the very last moment where Deadpool goes back in time to prevent some stinging cinematic grievances (there is no post-end credit scene, so you can skedaddle early). This is clearly the role Reynolds feels a spiritual kinship with, and his caddish, charming, persistent persona makes the perfect conduit for the film's vulgar insanity. Whether it's spitting insults, splashing in over-the-top violence, or making odd observations about the similarities between the songs from Frozen and Yentl, Deadpool 2 is first and foremost a bloody, depraved meta comedy.\n\nDirector David Leitch (Atomic Blonde) steps in for the departing original film's director, Tim Miller, and continues his hot streak of stylish, action thrillers. Leitch has shown a propensity for staging intense action sequences to best showcase intricate choreography. With Deadpool 2, the most exciting moments are when the camera and editing allows the audience to fully appreciate the creativity of the choreography and stunt team. A shot of Cable leaping over the speeding caravan about to smash into him brings on a well-earned wow. Coming from that bruising world, I'm continually impressed with how Leitch approaches his action and finds organic points to develop and complicate matters. The prison caravan attack is the action peak with well-constructed, parallel lines of activity to follow and collaborate upon. It's our first taste of Deadpool and X-Force versus the might of Cable. The characters enter the fray at different points and get separated from the runaway caravan, which keeps the momentum going. While the comedy is prioritized, Deadpool 2 can still unleash enough exciting, silly, and satisfying action.\n\nThe biggest additions to the sequel are an adversary and an ally, and both leave a favorable impression while still making you wish that Deadpool 2 had done more with them. Brolin (Avengers: Infinity War) bulked up considerably to play the gruff cyborg from the future, and his super serious, macho straight man provides a terrific comic foil for Deadpool, much like the stuffy Colossus in the first film. Brolin's character is a capable fighter with a pretty streamlined back-story (shades of Looper abound) but it's hard not to feel a little disappointment with how he's ultimately utilized. He's a great asset that feels put away for too long. Zazie Beetz (TV's Atlanta) has a fun introduction especially as it relates to her mutant power, great luck. Deadpool scoffs at this as a power, and \"being deeply un-cinematic,\" but Domino proves otherwise as she's able to dodge split-second danger in grand, complicated, Final Destination-like circumstances. Every time she's onscreen, Domino brings a curiosity quality to the movie, and it's usually something imaginative and fun. Beetz has an innate spunky energy, which makes it sad when the movie often asks her to be dour and dismissive. It's taking such a lively character and constricting what makes her amusing and unique.\n\nThe biggest thing holding back the film, besides a general sense of \"more of the same\" or its inherent lack of stakes, is that the entire storyline is built around saving a mutant teen.... and I kind of hated the kid. My first impression was not good and it didn't get much better from there. Part of it may be that Russell is meant to be an angry, obnoxious teenager, and maybe part of it is the generally grating performance from Dennison (Hunt for the Wilder People), but I could not care about this kid. Unfortunately, a lot of thematic emphasis is placed on saving the soul of this one annoying, wayward teenager. He's supposed to be a point of redemption for Deadpool and a promise to be fulfilled, but my pal Ben Bailey came up with an instantly better revision. Instead of introducing this new teen character who will one day grow up into a super villain that slaughters Cable's future family, why not have it be Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand)? We already have an investment in her character and it would provide a better, more personal sense of stakes for the story. Plus, Hildebrand (Tragedy Girls) is actually a good actress.\n\nIf you were one of the many fans who enjoyed the irreverent antics of the first Deadpool, then you'll enjoy Deadpool 2 as it's more or less the same movie with a slightly limited freshness date. These movies are fun, funny, and ridiculous, but they're also good for little else than a wicked good time, and that's okay. There isn't much ambition to be anything more than an irreverent satire on super heroes with edgy humor and explosive violence. The running theme of the sequel questions what Deadpool has to keep on going, and he's told it's one very specific F-word: \"family.\" I think it's a different F-word, namely \"franchise.\" Fox (Disney?) will need the services of the merc with the mouth for an extended engagement as long as audiences do not tire of the same studio brand of naughtiness reheated with a few different ingredients added per revisit.\n\nNate's Grade: B",

I knew when the original 'Deadpool' director Tim Miller bowed out of this movie mid-production that it was a sign of trouble, and try as the writers might to overcome his loss (#MaximumEffort), they fell a little short. It's chock full of the meta gags, fourth-wall breaks, and self-referential quips that were the hallmarks of the first one, but it all feels a little contrived this time. For starters, the entire premise is just off... DP tells you right from the start that this is a family film, which I assumed was a joke, but sadly, he wasn't kidding. That doesn't mean that you should bring children - the language alone is not appropriate for kids, not to mention the violence - but why the hell would they give an unabashedly R-rated movie a sappy message about the importance of family/friendship? SERIOUSLY??? Ugh, I just can't. The whole tone is off right from the beginning... it's wrong for the character and it's wrong for the film. The movie is able to correct itself in places where it does recapture the shameless profanity and hilarity of the first film, but those moments are spotty and inconsistent. The story isn't strong (and having Deadpool call out the lazy writing in the movie doesn't excuse the lazy writing), and even though this kind of movie doesn't need a stellar, tightly-knit story, it has to make some kind of sense. This go-round, Deadpool is trying to save the life of a mutant fire-throwing kid that somehow isn't Pyro, because reasons. It feels very forced and unlikely, to say the least. But, I did enjoy myself and some of the gags are totally hilarious, especially if you are hip to superhero movie culture. And Yentl. The movie is packed with a constant stream of jokes and pop-culture references, some of which are so specific and targeted that they went over even my head... and I am pretty well-versed in pop-culture. The best parts are the action sequences where you can forget all about the nonsense behind why everyone is kicking ass and just enjoy the ass-kicking. Josh Brolin is great as Cable, but the way the story progresses totally neuters him as a proper villain. The most promising addition to DP's crew is Domino - she is a great character and I wanna see more of her (though I will always have a special place in my heart for The Vanisher... oh man, what a great gag). Though it made me laugh and entertained me for the entire 2 hours, it just couldn't capture the magic of the Deadpool 1... what was fun and original and gloriously irreverent in the first one feels a little worn out now. I guess it's to be expected, but it's disappointing nonetheless.",

As always Ryan Reynolds has perfected the deadpool role and I couldn't imagine anyone ever pulling off this role. The mixed CGI in quality didn't really affect my review but I will say this is a must for any X-Men fans and the whole X-Force is a really good scene.

            "content": "Deadpool 2 took everything that wasn't so good about the first movie and improved the shit out of it. I don't remember ever laughing this much in a movie. It was offensive, gory, and hilarious as expected. I was surprised at how good the acting was. Obviously, Deadpool is no Oscar movie, but the actors all brought their A-Game for whatever character they were playing. Ryan Reynolds was good as Deadpool (again), Josh Brolin was awesome as Cable, it was really fun seeing Deadpool and Cable on screen together, especially since Cable's serious attitude totally opposes Wade's lightheartedness about everything (not including the events that occur at the start), and every other actor each added something to the movie. The few problems I had were some special effects issues. There was a scene where Zazie Beetz's Domino jumps into a road and starts to run through it with a bunch of cars driving and crashing around her. They looked very off and extremely fake. And during the big Colossus vs. (Spoiler, I guess) fight scene, it looked silly. The editing was, for the most part, acceptable aside from a few choppy and confusing scenes where it was hard to tell what was going on. For example, T.J. Miller's Weasel gets kidnapped by Cable about halfway through the film. It showed Cable hiding around a corner waiting for Weasel to turn. This shot lasted onscreen for a couple of frames before cutting to another scene. When that cut back to Cable and Weasel, Weasel was tied to a chair and cable wait holding a gun. Upon first viewing, I totally missed that. So due to the occasional choppy editing, important moments could be missed, literally in the blink of an eye. But, this movie is the most fun I've had at the theater in such a long time. All the jokes were funnier than the ones in the first movie, they totally improved on the villain (who was stupidly weak in the first installment) and made him very compelling and capable of being felt for, despite how ruthless and evil he was (or would be in the future), and on top of everything, there was a hilarious soundtrack, getting songs titled \"Holy Shit Balls\" playing over fight scenes. The action was a lot more entertaining this time around, it was a lot more colorful too. But most importantly, Deadpool never got annoying like he did in the first movie. I don't know why but Deadpool just really got on my nerves in his 2016 debut movie. But like I said, everything's improved and it makes for a freaking amazing movie. Very strong 8/10.",

Now, the original DEADPOOL broke the mold somewhat by being truly funny before descending into the usual CGI fight sequences and explosions.  The opening credits sequence alone was worth the price of admission, and Ryan Reynolds clearly had a good time taking the piss out of these blockbuster monoliths.  \n\nSo, I don't begrudge anyone for being excited about the sequel.  In fact, if you loved the first one, you'll likely love the second.  It's very funny most of the time, has another hilarious title sequence, this time skewering James Bond films, and it undercuts the usual comic book crap  with meta-jokes which at times, literally tell you they're making fun of the very movie they're making.  It takes real smarts to do this, and I commend director David Leitch (ATOMIC BLONDE) for finding that balance between satire and involved storytelling, along with the able work of ZOMEBIELAND screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick.  Ryan Reynolds also shares a writing credit, and it's easy to see his contributions thanks to his career-long ability to make hay out of smarmy material.  \n\nI even enjoyed there performances here, with Reynolds having a blast and ably supported by the likes of Josh Brolin, Julian Dennison (the breakout star of HUNT FOR THE WILDERPEOPLE), ATLANTA's Zazie Beetz, who has that cool Pam Grier as COFFY vibe down pat, Brianna Hildebrand wonderfully holding down the queer element of the film, Leslie Uggams once again kicking ass as Blind Al, and last but not least, Morena Baccarin giving fun zest to the thankless part of Deadpool's wife.  I love watching her banter with Reynolds as there's a spark there that feels special.  \n\nBUT.....and here's the rub...I literally forgot everything about this film as I was exiting the theater.  So little of it stuck with me.  I remember some of the gags, especially in the last few minutes, which break an already broken fourth wall.  I loved when Reynolds announced a  CGI fight.  The humor combined with the shocking amount of violence works because the tone is just right.  \n\nStill, the DEADPOOL films remind me of a combination of LAUGH-IN mixed with THE MASK with a sprinkling of the late Robin Williams during one of his stream of consciousness routines.  All were funny in the moment, but just didn't find a permanent spot in my brain.  Ok, I take that back when it comes to LAUGH-IN with the indelible contributions of Lily Tomlin, Ruth Buzzi and Artie Johnson, to name a few, but let's be honest, that show missed more than it hit.   \n\nDEADPOOL hits its targets more often than not, and more often than most, and I'm sure there are supporters of it who can defend this film and win.  I admit I am so not the target audience for it, but readily admit it's skilled at what it sets out to do, whatever the hell it did!",

He shoots up the place, breaks a few guards' arms , fires off grenades and let's not forget the big holes he put in the walls going in and out.  So that's a lot of rebuilding to  be done, as well as guards laid up in hospital until broken bones heal.  A while then.  After this, they organise a convoy to transport prisoners to a new location.  Deadpool, meanwhile, has escaped and formed X-Force.  In the ensuing melee, more chaos, more injured guards and even a destroyed bridge.

I was really excited to see this film, and it was one of most anticipated movies of 2018.\nRyan Reynolds is brilliant as Deadpool. This role was made for him. He is incredibly funny, and surprisingly in this film, gives a quite compelling dramatic performance. There is quite a lot of Deadpool outside of the suit, being Wade Wilson, and I thought that was a bold and smart move. Ryan Reynolds obviously knows this character all around, so he is one of my absolute favorite parts of the film.\nJosh Brolin as Cable was AWESOME. The action with him was done really well and his character arch was amazing. He gave the character more heart than I anticipated and he once again proved why he will own the cinemas this summer.\nZazie Beetz as Domino was also really cool and innovative. I can settle the argument by saying that luck is definitely a super-power. Some of the action-sequences with her were some of the most engaging scenes in the movie.\nAs for flaws in the movie, I felt that the story, at times, bit off more than it could chew, as some of the story felt too compact, which led to pacing issues. Also, some of the CGI was not impressive, while at other times, the CGI looked great. Also, some of the drama in this movie gets cut way too short by comedy, and that, to me, is what separates a good comedy from a great comedy, it's ability to give the dramatic scenes enough time to settle before telling more jokes.\nOverall, I had a great time with 'Deadpool 2' and I am excited to see this movie again.",

I found myself laughing in this movie a lot, and also being in awe at how visually dazzling and fun the action was. There were several heartfelt moments that made me tear up a lot, and I loved Julian Dennison's performance as Russell because it brought more depth and emotion to the film. Deadpool 2 is not nearly as good as it's predecessor, mainly because it tries to spoof itself a little too much and a few of the gags were repetitive and disrupted the plot. A few of the plot twists also frustrated me because they seemed unnecessary. I feel as if Cable should have received more screen time, as should the X-Force. Overall; Deadpool 2 was a very entertaining and funny sequel that had a plot that felt a little messy and crowded and a few scenes that tried to spoof itself far too much, but in the end, I really quite liked. - 72%",

Once again, you can see why this was a role born for him to play. The jokes are just as witty and funny as they weere before, and i dont remember anything being recycled from the first. You know everything about his character, so lets talk more about Cable and the X Force members.\n\nIt is the sumer of Josh Brolin. Hes in yet another Marvel associated film, but this time, we actually see him instead of a CGI infused purple baddie. Cable is a great roll for him, and while he looks the part, the writing for him was a bit stale. That could just be a straight from the page take on his character though. Lets also give a head nod to Zazie Beetz. Her breakthrough in Atlanta on TV helped snag her what appears to be a reoccuring role as Domino.\n\nThrough all the gags and jokes and ohysical comedy, there is a plot here about saving the world, or a kid, or himself, or something like that. I suppose it doesnt really have to mean much when you are laughing along the entire way.",

The original was a romantic comedy and this one is a family road trip movie. Breaking the fourth wall is still amusing and a staple to the character of deadpool. The only flaw I had was the villain was barely there. I know it was to build the relationship between Deadpool and Firefist, terrible name, but I could have used more from Juggernaut and the Headmaster. They needed more of a build but I still enjoyed the film. Domino was the best new addition, in my opinion. She had perfect lines and great chemistry with the team.

Hilarious credit scenes on both ends that nearly outshine everything else in the film. It's not necessarily worse than the original film; in fact, in some ways it may be a bit better, funnier and weirder. However, the sheer lack of sufficient originality makes it taste more like a microwaved chimichanga than a fresh one.\nIn this X-Men spinoff, wisecracking Wade Wilson befriends a young, troubled mutant who finds himself being hunted by time-traveling villain Cable. Anybody familiar with time-traveling fiction, or have taken a theoretical ethics course, won't be terribly surprised by any of the later reveals or moral complexities. The film's real strength is in it's less \"important\" features. Clearly working to connect it more directly with the larger X-Men universe, the side characters are given ampler screen-time, including super-cool newcomer Domino, who's mutant-ability of \"just being lucky\", makes her the most powerful hero since of Superman. Director Leitch (John Wick) uses his flair for shooting action to solid comedic effect, including a standout parachuting scene that had me in stitches.\nBut, of course, the star is still Reynolds' Deadpool, who's most interesting power is probably his unique ability to see himself as a fictional character in a movie, constantly winking while everyone around him works in expected sincerity. But like I said, none of this is new anymore. Where the first felt like a subversive spin on the superhero genre, this is more like an Austin Powers' film: a pop-culture-citing-machine that's pleasantly diverting, but nothing to rave about.",

He makes fun of Fox. He makes fun of all the things associated with the franchise, and ultimately makes fun of himself.\n\nNothing is left sacred by the time the film is over, and this is why it works.\n\nThis is no AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR, or a film that brings a cinephile to a pleasurable finale, this is a \"let's just make fun of everyone and everything in an age where smart comedy is dead\" kind of film.\n\nFrom the opening scene to the three secret scenes at the end, DEADPOOL 2 is the best screenplay of 2018.\n\nDEADPOOL 2 might be an action comedy, but there's a real beating heart to it, and the secret to the film's recipe is its emotional core, Deadpool himself.\n\nHe's a character that's been kicked and knocked down, and life's been really tough on him, as a character with cancer and this terrible scarring on his face, and ultimately this is why he is entirely relatable.\n\nAnother positive aspect is the fact that the film is filled with an assortment of nasty antagonists, but there is no one main villain.\n\nDEADPOOL 2 doesn't have the traditional mustache-twirling villain.\n\nThe audience is led to believe that Cable is the actual villain and it's going to be Cable versus Deadpool. Ultimately, that doesn't turn out to be the case and they team up.\n\nThe brilliance of the film is that it never entirely sacrifices the stakes of a situation for the comedy, but rather delivers the jokes the same way someone might when they are in a horrifying situation - out of sheer fear or nervousness.\n\nThe film's pacing is as relentless as its dialogue and stays dynamic throughout the film's duration.\n\nVisually, the film does not offer fight sequences the way one would expect.\n\nTo this day, the CAPTAIN AMERICA: WINTER SOLDIER causeway fight sequence is one of the best choreographed, paced, filmed, etc. sequences in cinema history.\n\nThough DEADPOOL 2 had a highway chance scene at the film's midpoint it did not match the complexities that other films have offered.\n\nThis is where this film suffers the most.\n\nYes, the jokes were better, and the story was deeper - but the fight sequences were not as big.\n\nThe final battle between to titans, and the lead up to Deadpool's overall mission in the film work but do feel a bit anti-climactic by the time they are over.\n\nDEADPOOL 2 is a solid sequel, that not only goes for the low blow joke, but adds a politically incorrect vibe to a cinematic universe that tends to play it safe in most cases.\n\nExiting the film, the audience will have but one question on their minds, \"When does the third chapter come out?\"",

I liked his character, but not as much as I expected I would. He was still good. Other stand outs for me were Zazie Beetz as Domino, Julian Dennison as Firefist, and as always T. J. Miller as Weasel. The movie had amazing jokes and was probably funnier than the first one. Sometimes it did rely on jokes a little too much which you could tell at parts. The action sequences were good, as they were either deep or humorous. The CGI was fine, there were quite a few times that you could tell it wasn\u2019t real however. The music choices were amazing. It reminded me of Guardians of the Galaxy. The plot was interesting and kept my attention for almost the whole thing. There was one character that was added which I thought was cool but it just seemed a little bit out of place. I though Deadpool 2 was a funny and enjoyable movie. Not as good as the first one but still pretty good. My Grade: B+",

            "content": "The 2016 release of Deadpool changed the game for superhero movies by presenting an R-rated, ultra-violent character. It wasn't the first time Ryan Reynolds played Deadpool, but this was the approach fans wanted after the abysmal X-Men Origins: Wolverine in 2009. It raked in massively at the box office and proved to be the best role for Reynolds to date. In Deadpool 2, Wade Wilson has seen better days being his foul-mouthed mercenary alter ego Deadpool. The job never ends, but it won't stop him from celebrating his anniversary to his wife Vanessa (Baccerine). They decide to start a family, which brings a newfound joy to Wade. In the middle of their romantic night a few hitmen break in turning the night into tragedy. Wade starts to feel extra mopey wondering if his actions and lifestyle were the cause of all of this. He's literally scooped by the mutant Colossus (Kapicic) and taken back to Xavier's School for Gifted Mutants in an attempt to turn him into one of the X-Men.\n\nOne of their first missions is to rescue a young mutant named Russell/Firefist (Dennison) who's in the middle of a hostage situation at his orphanage. Firefist comes with more baggage than Deadpool realized when he comes face to face with Josh Brolin's Cable, a robot sent from the future to kill Russell. Wade's growing paternal nature comes into play as he feels the call to be Russell's protector from Cable. Deadpool and Colossus gather a few more mutants like Domino, Negasonic Teenage Warhead, and a few other surprise characters to create a new super group named the X-Force. Deadpool reiterates that this is a gender-neutral name as opposed to the outdated X-Men.\n\nThe first Deadpool felt fresh and original setting the character apart from other Marvel characters. Its self-deprecating tone and lavish pop culture references allowed the movie to never take itself too seriously like a majority of superhero movies do. The writing team of Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick, and star Ryan Reynolds earned their R-rating with every bloody action scene and politically incorrect slam the character mouthed off. This is not kid-friendly material by any means. Now that we know what to expect from the character, that same original quality is lacking, but the tone is exactly what you come to expect from the character. There are so many jabs packed into any given scene poking fun of Reynolds, Marvel, DC, and a variety of other references to the superhero genre. The opening title sequence was a perfect James Bond spoof with the Celine Dion sung theme \"Ashes.\" The catch with this style is that you have to know the genre to appreciate the humor or else you may be lost.\n\nOnce we meet the film's key villain of Cable, it becomes very apparent that the movie is clearly drawing from The Terminator with no qualms about it. This would never work with another movie, yet given the nature of Deadpool 2, you buy into how much it rips off James Cameron's 1984 futuristic film. Josh Brolin always makes for a strong bad guy, and Cable has a few tricks up his sleeve with the character. This is his second time playing a Marvel villain within a just a few weeks following the release of Avengers: Infinity War. Yes, there's a dig at that movie too. He's such a fun character that I wish the writers would have brought him in a bit sooner. The story meanders early on with Deadpool being a sad sack leading into the introduction of the Firefist character. There's a prison sequence with both of them that drags a bit. There was a lack of forward motion, which is the opposite of how witty and precise the humor can be overall.\n\nLike many successful sequels, Deadpool 2 is bolder, bigger, and definitely pushes the boundaries. I actually think it could have gone even further without feeling too obnoxious. Director David Leitch knows his way around executing large-scale action sequences given his work on John Wick and Atomic Blonde. There are many times Deadpool breaks the fourth wall and addresses the audience. Even he admits, \"There's a big CGI fight coming up.\" There are quite a few surprises along the way, and the writers are not afraid to kill off characters left and right. Ryan Reynolds is a big contributing factor to the film's success as he knows how to make this character stand out. He's incredibly egotistical and mouthy which could be off-putting for some, but the target audience will holler with laughter. Returning for this second round is Morena Baccarin as Wade's wife, Vanessa, T.J. Miller as his friend and barkeep Weasel, and Leslie Uggams as Big Al. I'd like to put in a request for more Big Al in future Deadpool sequels. Terry Crews, Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, and a few surprise faces pop up in cameo roles.\n\nI prefer my superhero movies to feel a bit more grounded in reality instead of the ridiculously over-the-top nature of Deadpool 2. That's just a personal preference, but fans of the first film will no doubt enjoy the sequel as the bite still lands. I don't see the franchise slowing down but maybe it can blend the two approaches in the next film without compromising the fun factor.\n\nIs It Worth Your Trip to the Movies? There's no sequel slump for Deadpool 2\n\nRATING: 3.5 out of 5 TICKET STUBS",

            "content": "\"We're going to form a super-duper fucking group,\" says Deadpool around the midpoint of his new movie. \"We need them tough, morally flexible and young enough to carry a franchise for 10-12 years.\" This is fairly typical of the sort of meta-commentary we have come to expect from the titular motormouthed assassin who mixes the knowing winks to the audience of a modern day Groucho Marx with the genre-savviness of Abed from Community. However for once, as it also implies, the egotistical trickster god of Fox's X-Men Universe is finally willing to let other characters share some of his screentime.\n\nDeadpool's self titled debut in 2016 (ignoring, of course, his terrible in-name-only appearance in X-Men Origins: Wolverine in 2009) was pretty much a one man show. Although he had able support from those playing both friends and enemies, the entire enterprise was staked on a loud, screen-hugging performance from Ryan Reynolds in the title role. (There was even a joke about the bizarre lack of recognisable faces seen in the X Men mansion. That joke returns again here but with a witty and far more expensive punchline). However, what a performance it was. Reynolds had been involved with the production from the very beginning; campaigning to get the film greenlit, financed and given the freedom it needed to work. The actor created and subsumed the role to the degree that it is now hard to delineate where Ryan Reynolds the actor ends and Wade Wilson the character starts. (There's even a popular silly fan theory that Deadpool is real and merely created the fake persona 'Ryan Reynolds' in order to produce his biography.) The film was puerile and sardonic but smart in its subversions and although all this attitude was unfortunately tacked onto what was otherwise a fairly formulaic 'origin story' it had a rough, scrappy underdog charm which carried it comfortably over the finish line.\n\nTwo years on Deadpool 2 has very different challenges to overcome. Gone is the novelty of such an unpredictable, off-brand character as is the sense of being a low budget outsider fighting against the system. Deadpool was a massive critical and financial success making its title character a household name in the process. Deadpool 2 therefore has an uphill struggle to get anywhere near the rebellious spirit of its predecessor.\n\nThe obvious reaction to this would be to make everything bigger and bolder than before: more action, bigger stakes, riskier jokes and even more meta referencing. And yes, that is exactly what they do. Thankfully, however, there is also an attempt to improve the qualities as well as the quantities of the original. The original director, Tim Miller, has been replaced by David Leitch (hilariously credited here as 'One of the guys who killed the dog in John Wick') who, both with that film and last years Atomic Blonde, has previous with making films known for their inventive action and strong atmosphere despite being hung on fairly generic and overly convoluted plot-lines. Here he stages some similarly ridiculous action sequences which make full use of the slapstick potential of a hero who can be battered and maimed repeatedly and survive.\n\nThe first third of the film seems to be built around an attempt to create an emotional core for the story going forward. This is done somewhat awkwardly with some scenes of mawkish self-seriousness that feel exactly the kind of thing that our protagonist would mercilessly mock if they appeared in another movie. Save for a ridiculous Bond movie style opening credit sequence (cut to a Celine Dion song written for the film no less!) this first act feels fairly muddled and unsure of its tone. The plot is too dark and somber to be as funny as it strives to be but the drama of it is completely undersold by its inability to take itself seriously for too long. Thankfully things quickly pick up in the films second act with the arrival of some new characters to challenge the 'Merc With a Mouth's' grip on the narrative.\n\nFirstly, Josh Brolin's much hyped Cable is as gruff and humourless as expected, making for an enjoyably contrasting foil to our hero. His backstory is nothing more than a reworking of the plot of Rian Johnson's Looper filtered through the aesthetics of James Cameron's Terminator films but it is divorced enough from the films central silliness, and delivered with surprising pathos by Brolin, that it lands pretty effectively. Even more effective is the introduction of The Hunt For The Wilderpeople's Julian Dennison as Russell, a young and angry mutant going by the unfortunate codename 'Firefist.' He plays the part as pretty much a superpowered Ricky Baker, full of angst and bravado that eclipses his actual abilities. Deadpool himself is an incredibly immature lead so making him responsible for a precocious ward is a good way to challenge the character and hone his potentially grating smugness into something more human and sympathetic. Unfortunately Dennison and Reynolds don't get an awful lot of screen time together but there is enough there to build an interesting relationship which grounds much of what follows. Instead Deadpool is forced to go looking for a team of allies with who can help him in his mission to save the boy.\n\nThis is the X Force, Deadpool's own more open (and nominally genderneutral) version of the X Men. As expected, they are a bizarre mix of peculiar characters who are both in-universe (and likely in the writer's room) rejects from that more successful and mainstream superhero team. This includes such exciting champions as Vanisher (the most low-budget hero ever as he is permanently invisible making it near impossible to tell if he is onscreen or not) and Peter (a middle-aged man with no powers or skills who simply replied to the advert because it 'looked like fun.') Most importantly this is where the film introduces Domino (Zazie Beetz) a fiercely independent young woman full of confidence and sass and who goes on to steal all her scenes with star making charisma as a mutant whose power seems to be solely that she is incredibly, implausibly lucky.\nUltimately Wade Wilson is exactly the kind of hero we need right now. At a time when fascists and their pathetic ilk are somehow successfully convincing a surprising number of rebellious youths that cleaning their rooms, censoring differing opinions, sucking up to authority and generally acting like racist and pervy old men is somehow new, empowering and revolutionary, it is refreshing to see an anarchic potential role model that maintains the air of punk-like unpredictability and complete disregard for the rules while also being completely lacking in petty hatred or prejudice. Even though Deadpool himself would never ascribe to any ideology, (he openly mocks the goody-two-shoes X Men as 'a dated metaphor for racism in the Sixties') the movie itself is quietly progressive. Not only are Deadpool's allies a more diverse mix than most superhero team-ups but this film features the first openly gay couple in Marvel movie history (a revelation which is treated with the exact shrug of unexciting acceptance that such an everyday relationship would actually have in a world where psychic powers and time travel are common occurrences.) It's this strange sense of oddball acceptance which powers the film through its final act and keeps the film feeling light and warmly charming even as the title character's adolescent humour slowly begins to become exhausting.\n\nIn the earlier X Force auditions scene we are also introduced to a mutant played by popular, up-and-coming star Bill Skarsgard who introduces himself as 'Zeitgeist.' Deadpool asks if that means that his power is to have his finger of the button of modern culture. Nope. He just vomits toxic acid. This one joke feels like a good metaphor for Deadpool 2 as a whole. In equal parts it's an intelligent satire of an exact place and time in pop culture history and also simply an explosion of grotesque toilet humour. For fans of the the first Deadpool, and comic book movies in general, Deadpool 2 will feel like a drunken night out with a hilarious old friend. For the uninitiated however, it may feel more like being trapped in a lift with that one guy in the office who won't stop trying to crack jokes about everything and driving you slowly insane. Still, despite its clunkiness, Deadpool 2 is faster, funnier and more action packed than its predecessor and, much like it's near immortal namesake, it's pretty damn hard to put down.\n\nFrom MOGULAMANIA:\nmogulamania.blogspot.co.uk/2018/05/new-release-review-deadpool-2.html",

When it comes to sequels of Super Hero movies, they either be something truly great like Spider-Man 2, Captain America: Civil War, The Dark Knight, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, but there can be some bad ones like Thor: The Dark World, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, but Deadpool 2 is in the good sequels spot... nope scratch that, amazing sequels.\nI loved the first Deadpool from 2016 as I thought it was the best movie of that year, it wasn't my first exposure to the character as I have known who Deadpool was before the first movie came out, I was pretty excited for when they announced a sequel to the Deadpool movie and this movie met my expectations.\nDeadpool 2 has a great story, great characters, great cast members old and new, Ryan Reynolds is still top notch as Deadpool, Josh Brolin as Cable is so great, so he's Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War and Cable in Deadpool 2, not the first time MCU and Fox shared cast members, the action scenes are awesome, the music is great and used right, the CGI is still great for Marvel standards, and to top it all off the jokes were absolutely funny.\nI can definitely say that Deadpool 2 is even better than the first movie, I really loved this movie and I wonder if we will get a third Deadpool movie? Only time will tell.\nI highly recommend Deadpool 2 to anyone who loved the first Deadpool movie, any fans of Deadpool in general, Marvel, Superhero movies, or fans of Ryan Reynolds.\nI give Deadpool 2 a 10 out of 10 an amazing sequel and in my opinion even better than the first Deadpool.",

            "content": "Deadpool 2 none spoilery review\n\nFor those on my friends list that have yet to experience the 2nd instalment of the Deadpool franchise then here is my take on the film.\n\nDeadpool 2 comes off the highly successful 1st film which took none comic readers like me and millions of others by surprise and gave us a character that literally takes the piss out of the universe they inhabit. This fact impacts people's perception of the 2nd film with reviewers liking the film but generally feeling meh when comparing the two.\n\nRyan as stated that to make Deadpool work you need to put him in the worst situation, in which there is no way back and they do a good enough job of Rock meet Bottom (literally) in the 2nd film to make it last a solid 2 and bit hours.\n\nI will be 1st to admit some parts don't work and then others just have you laughing your ass off. They work on the Deadpool character really well showing off a more emotional side to him than you would expect.\n\nAction sequences are littered throughout and in true fashion from the previous instalment, Deadpool is on hand to take the piss out of them too.\n\nThe stand out characters away from Deadpool who is great, is Domino and Cable. The actress playing Domino did a wonderful job portraying an ability that should be hard to do, considering she as to react to everything going on around her. Cable is another strong character which in fairness could have been fleshed out more in the opening segments, you can tell why he is doing what he is doing but would have been nice to get a solid connection to him.\n\nSo if number 1 was a love story number 2 tries to be a family film, just one with swearing, violence and sexual references and a scene that you can never unsee even it you try.\n\nStick around during the end credits as Deadpool continues to take the piss out of the film making and the current Marvel obsession with end credit scenes by offering up two lengthy ones of his own.\n\nSo when going to see Deadpool 2 please go in not wanting something to recapture the 1st film, because nothing will beat the nostalgia of the 1st film. It was a unique experience in recent movie going experiences. Number 1 had to send you on a journey of how Wade becomes Deadpool, you are now seeing Wade embracing being Deadpool and the adventures he is going on.",

            "content": "The merc is back.  So everybody's favorite sarcastic antihero has returned (Ryan Reynolds).  He crosses paths with a misunderstood child with fire powers (Julian Dennison) and decides to take him under his wing, but soon finds out that there is a time traveling cyborg named Cable (Josh Brolin) that is trying to kill the kid.  Much like everyone else, I really dug the first movie.  It was fun, surprising, exceeded all expectations, but the real standout element to it was just how laugh out loud funny it is.  It also had a giant return for a relatively modest budget, so you know they were going to come back with a sequel.  While I do think there is room for improvement, I can say without a shadow of a doubt is that if you loved the first one, you are at the very least going to like this.  The biggest detriment to Deadpool 2 is that it is merely more of the same.  It is more fourth wall breaking, more obscenities with a smile, more gleeful violence and more of the Ryan Reynolds' show.  If that's what you were hoping to get out of it, then this is clearly for you, but I was hoping that they would do something new with the story or develop the characters in some sort of meaningful way.  Even though this is fun, I wouldn't say that I got any of that out of this sequel.  They were content to maintain the status quo and it doesn't try to outdo itself, which I don't think was the right call to make; it's not a bad thing per se, it is just mildly disappointing.  To give some perspective, I would say that this is to the first Deadpool the same way that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is to its predecessor; it is perfectly serviceable, but you're always going to want to rewatch the first movie over the second.  This is competently made, and unless this just isn't your thing, you will get entertainment value out of this.  The jokes do hit for the most part, and I don't want to spoil any of the surprises or stingers because they do score some big laughs.  I do like the addition of Zazie Beetz as Domino; I've never seen a superhero whose superpower is luck, and it made for some pretty cool action sequences.  Deadpool 2 does have merit, but I don't feel like I am in the wrong for wanting more out of it.",

            "content": "Fun fact before I begin this review a family in the theater I was in decided to bring their infant into Deadpool\u2026. The theater can be a very interesting place. Ok lets review the movie. Deadpool 2 was directed by David Leitch, and stars Ryan Reynolds, Josh Brolin, Zazie Beetz, Morena Baccarin, Bill Skarsgard, Brianna Hildebrand, Terry Crews, and newcomer Julian Dennison. And this film we follow Wade Wilson as he puts together a team none as the X-Force to try to save a mutant kid who is in danger of being killed by time traveling mutant Cable. Now I was looking forward to this film for a number of reasons. One being that the first Deadpool is one of my favorite movies. And even though Tim Miller, the man behind the first film, wasn\u2019t directing I still had confidence in David Leitch. The reason I had confidence in David Leitch was because he was behind films such as Atomic Blonde (2017), and both John Wick movies so the man clearly knows how to make good action films. And all I can say is I can\u2019t wait to see what he does next because Deadpool 2 is shockingly almost as good as its predecessor. What makes Deadpool 2 stand out as a sequel is the fact that it knows that it\u2019s a sequel. What I mean is this movie pretty much points out almost every single sequel clich\u00e9 in the book and it makes it really funny. Another thing that is great about this movie is the fact that even though it points out all the typical tropes that are seen in sequels it still manages to be a little unpredictable. Now those two statements may seem like I am contradicting myself a little bit and I don\u2019t really know how to explain it more clearly for you. Which kind of puts me in an awkward position so all I can say is see the film and you will know what I am talking about. Moving past that lets get to the performances. Ryan Reynolds is and probably always will be great as Deadpool. There is honestly no one else out there that can play this character better than him. And Josh Brolin plays Cable. Now I was a little worried about this because as all of you know Brolin was previously in The Avengers: Infinity War. So I thought that his performance was going to drag or feel forced in this film because he was going from one super sonic major blockbuster movie to another super sonic major blockbuster movie. However, Brolins performance as Cable was actually very good and to be completely honest I can\u2019t imagine anyone else playing that role. And he even has a few comedic lines as well as Reynolds does. Now I am going to go off track for a few seconds because I know your all wondering (or at least I hope I do) \u201cwhich was the better Brolin performance?\u201d In my opinion Thanos was better in terms of performances however I am not stating that his performance as Cable was bad it was just I thought he was better in the Avengers. Ok now lets get back on track. Another great thing about this movie was the films characters in the X-Force team especially Domino portrayed by Zazie Beetz. I hope that her performance doesn\u2019t get overlooked by the two main characters because she was fantastic. Aside from the performances and characters of this movie I have to say that the film was wise to choose David Leitch as the director. The reason I say this is because though I absolutely love Tim Millers way of directing in the original as a low budget superhero movie. This film had a much bigger budget and needed someone who could make a film with a larger budget and still manage to make it great and I think Leitch was a better choice for this film. Also the movie much better fourth wall breaks then the previous film but that can be debated. I also loved how this film had a lot of pop culture references in it. And finally I feel like this film has a stronger story line than the original. Now Deadpool 2 is definitely a movie with flaws. For instance unlike the first film this film sort of relies on a little more CGI than the first one did when it came to action sequences. Also the characters of Negasonic Teenage Warhead and Colossus aren\u2019t in it as much as I hoped they would be and I say this because I loved both of those characters in the original so it would have been cool to see more of them. And believe it or not this film has a little more dialogue driven scenes than action scenes, which may test the patients of some people BUT almost all of the dialogue scenes are hilarious so in all honesty you may not even care. Beyond those flaws Deadpool 2 is a surprisingly great sequel that is almost as good as it predecessor, and like Infinity War is a great way to kick-start your summet. If you are fan of the comics or even just want a good action movie then I highly recommend Deadpool 2 for you I can guarantee you won\u2019t be disappointed.",

            "content": "At the end of 2016's Deadpool, Wade Wilson walked out of a door in his costume and a bathrobe and promised audiences the inclusion of Cable in the sequel. Given the amount of meta humor, 4th wall breaks, and general un-seriousness of the film, many people probably thought this was just another joke and no more than an empty promise. Alas, 2018's Deadpool 2 delivered on that promise and brings another round of over-the-top violence, profanity, humor, and more of everyone's favorite Merc with a Mouth.\n\nRyan Reynolds once again stars as the titular character of the film: Wade Wilson a.k.a. Deadpool. He is joined by a colorful cast of new supporting characters, including Josh Brolin (yes, the actor who plays Thanos) as Cable, a time-traveling mercenary with a metal arm and a tendency to kill people; Zazie Beetz as Domino, a mutant with the surprising helpful power of luck; and Julian Dennison as Firefist, a young mutant who was anger issues and the ability to produce fire from his hands. We also see the return of many of the supporting characters from the first Deadpool, including Weasel, Blind Al, Colossus, and Negasonic Teenage Warhead. The film's story follows Deadpool as he tries to prevent Cable from murdering the young Firefist, whom Cable believes is destined to become a ruthless killer.\n\nNow, Deadpool 2 is a difficult movie to critique. Its predecessor made its mark as an original and creative departure from typical superhero films. Many argue that the R-rated violence and profanity paved the way for the release of other R-rated hits the next year, including Logan and It. The film itself was gleeful in its abandon of action film norms and was a joy to watch... I've watched the film myself 5 or 6 times, and it is still one of my favorite movies to date. Deadpool 2 tries its best to capture the same lightning that made the first Deadpool such a success. In doing so, it cranks up the amount of pop culture and comic book references, makes more excessive use of 4th wall-breaking jokes, and makes the action more explosive and fast-paced than before. Film critics and concerned Deadpool fans might read that statement and raise a red flag... but don't be ashamed, I did the same thing at first. Those qualities are used to create a film that is exciting and a blast to watch. As a result, Deadpool 2 is somehow able to be a worthy sequel to its 2016 predecessor.\n\nSo why does Deadpool 2 work? It's hard to say. So, I'll go through and list some of its strengths. To start, the pacing of the movie is usually very fast. The pacing suffers the most at the beginning of the film after an event (which I won't spoil) happens and sends Wade into a spiral of sadness. It created some scenes and dialogue that just didn't seem to fit with the tone of the film, and while I saw why the writers had included it in the film after it had ended, it was still hard to justify its inclusion. Nevertheless, aside from those scenes I mentioned, I was never bored in the film. The action scenes, expositional scenes, humorous dialogue, and everything else flowed smoothly for most of Deadpool 2, allowing it to be entertaining throughout. And let's not forget to talk about the humor: it's back and on par with the standard that the first Deadpool set. To me, it felt like it was more abundant this time around. I was worried that this would become a problem, but almost every joke in the film landed well with me, and there were even a few scenes where I laughed myself into tears. And since this movie is aiming to be a comedy, it's safe to say that it did its job. Finally, the action in Deadpool 2, which I was worried would be far too over-the-top and excessive, it just as satisfying and fun to watch as the first.\n\nI'll wrap up this review with a couple of other tidbits that I wanted to mention. First of all, I was very happy and satisfied with the amount and depth of the pop culture, film, and comic book references that were present throughout the film. As a movie buff, comic book fan, and Marvel film enthusiast, these made me a very happy filmgoer. Unfortunately, my second point brings up a problem that I had with the film. This problem is that Deadpool 2's CGI is... pretty bad. Maybe I'm being nitpicky, or maybe my expectations for computer-generated objects in film has been set way too high by films like Avengers: Infinity War, Annihilation, or War for the Planet of the Apes. Nevertheless, there were several moments in the film where I couldn't stop paying attention to noticeable green-screen, poorly rendered CGI characters, or effects that looked fake. One example I remember was a scene where the camera focused on Colossus' face as he was talking, and it was a rough scene to watch. This was even more baffling to me when I remembered Colossus looking much more believable in the first Deadpool. Maybe these issues will be fixed with future releases of the film, like when it comes out on home media. Until then, I'll just try and forget about it.\n\nAs you've probably already heard from the critics that actually get paid for doing this, Deadpool 2 isn't quite as good as 2016's Deadpool. However, this doesn't stop it from being one of the funniest and most fun movies I have seen in a while. The film continues to do justice to its titular character's legacy in the comic books and it acts as yet another apology for the abomination (that Ryan Reynolds also portrayed) that we received with 2009's X-Men Origins: Wolverine. It has some issues regarding pacing and tone and the unfortunate CGI problem that I mentioned, but it is otherwise a blast to watch. I'll definitely be buying Deadpool 2 once it comes out on Blu-Ray, and I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars.",

The sequel, Deadpool 2, feels like the studio execs who ran X-Men into the ground came in and tried to teach David Leitch and Ryan Reynolds how superhero movies are REALLY made,  Because the film is stuffed with the kind of formulaic garbage the first movie made fun of.  It has plot elements that should have been retired decades ago (not to spoil things, but the early audience reviews that said audiences didn't like a female character being fridged?  Yeah, that still made final cut).  And overall, the same jokes were made in the same pacing as the first movie.  Fifteen minutes in and you knew how everything was going to end.  It almost felt like the cast felt the same way, because the mid-credits scenes (there are no post credit ones, so don't wait around) basically spent 2 minutes undoing all the suck that happened in the film, through a cheesy deus ex-machina.  (That's not a criticism, that's praise!  You only got two minutes to fix everything, use whatever you can!)  If you're a fan of Deadpool, by all means go see it.  Just... go with lowered expectations, and be fearful for the future of the franchise.",

Better plot, better story, better villains, better CGI, better action, and more action-packed. But I had a few big problems with this movie....like when all the X-Force team members died in the parachute skydiving scene.... It was funny, but it was also really frustrating that they really wasted all of those characters. I can't believe they wasted Terry Crews who is such a great actor and a legend. I would have loved to see Shatterstar, Bedlam, and the other X-Force members (that didn't survive) in the upcoming X-Force movie. So much wasted potential and so many missed opportunities for those nonsurviving X-Force characters. I would have preferred that they cast a white Canadian woman as Domino and have her skin chalk white and make her have a black-spotted eye, black hair, and have no afro instead of Zazie Beetz who didn't even have chalk white skin and the black-spotted eye. And I would have preferred for a tall, blonde, Caucasian man to play Firefist instead of Julian Dennison, who is Polynesian. I hate racial inaccuracy to comic book characters in movies. Zazie Beetz and Julian Dennison were both miscast in their roles. At least in the end, Deadpool traveled back in time to save Vanessa and Peter from dying. Overall, it was a great and solid sequel that surpassed its predecessor.\n\nRating: 8.8/10",

He was always just the \"edgy\" comic relief that I appreciated for it's existence and thought it was good that he captured a beloved fanbase which can latch onto his lude and dark humor, I just never found myself as one of them. However, I did THOROUGHLY enjoy the first movie for it's comedy which I chuckled at for the most part, and for it's faithfulness to the character. I think I can say, as a huge comic book fan, this one is even better. The jokes didn't always land as much as I wanted too, but I put that more on my personal humor tastes changing rather than the movie itself failing in that regard. What makes this one better, is the embrace of it's material and the inclusion of a nice roster of comic book characters even if some had very little screen time. One large mutant in particular filled me with so much joy at his appearance. Cable was a relatable CHARACTER and helped balance out Deadpool's witty banter pretty well. The story about Deadpool saving the kid is okay, but I never felt myself too sympathetic to the child. Either way, Deadpool is a great movie not only for Deadpool fans, but for comic fans in general especially if you have an affinity for the X-Men.",

Deadpool 2 took a hit 19 and was dealt a jack by the dealer. It was like death by a thousand paper cuts... 75 minutes in I had bled out without even knowing it. \n\nLooking back, this movie will be viewed as nothing more than the bridge that got Reynold's character from origin story to reluctant team player--all so they could start their version of the Avengers (which admittedly, I'm actually way more keen on than the actual Avengers). \n\nAt the end of the day, there are plenty of writers who could have gotten Wade to that position, while actually introducing a villain (yes my sentence is over. There wasn't even a villain in this movie. Sorry, some 55 year old stereotype doesn't count). \n\nIt also must be said, that in Deadpool 2's quest making sure everyone knew how socially progressive it was (this was by far the most cringe worthy of the meta elbow nudges) they killed off Vanessa--a strong, badass woman with uniquely jaded-yet-uplifting personality, and one who was begging for more screen time--simply for the purpose of using her as the tried and true plot device to get Wade to go on his version of the hero's journey. And they couldn't even do it without some terribly out of place dream (for lack of a better word) sequences. \n\nIt's just entertaining enough to see for the sake of being caught up, with the hope the inevitable X-Force movie will be better.",

But this movie pulls the latest deceptive trend of tricking you into thinking it was better than it actually was. The trickery lies in the post credit scenes. Giving you a few funny scenes and closing on a high note. After I had a day to process it, I realized this movie was really a disaster. It seems they took the whole JJ Abrams' \"Think the first movie, only bigger\" approach.More action,more jokes,more gore,and more luridness. First off, the story line is very weak and uninteresting. It's meanders about but really never materializes. Cable's backstory is non-existent -He's seemingly just a guy. Some of the jokes are funny, but most felt cheap and you could see them coming a mile away.Some of them were even used in the first movie, while others they felt they needed to explain it to you - Which is never acceptable.Almost every bit of dialogue from Deadpool is a one-liner and it's exhausting. Equally exhausting was gore level.It was amped up and well past the the point of being off-putting.Pointless and not funny.If you're laughing while a guy gets ripped in half or fed into a woodchipper,then I think we've found the root cause of the rise of mass shootings.The CGI was also exceptionally bad. A few times it looked like a film from the late 90's.They somewhat acknowledge this at one point in the movie, but that doesn't mean they get a pass.But the biggest mistake they made in this movie was the decision to cast a kid \"Firefist\" as the villain.He was not the least bit convincing and at times his performance was cringe-worthy.When they first introduced him, I assumed he was a side character and honestly couldn't wait until the scene was finished. When I realized he was a crucial part of the story, I was in disbelief. I could go on pointing out the flaws of this movie, but I just don't have the time. I have a feeling most of these positive reviews will change in a few weeks as people come to the same realization as I did. This film managed to lose the magic that made the first so good. When a recipe works, adding more of everything won't improve the taste...It only makes it inedible. For the 3rd installment, I suggest they pump the brakes, and bring back Tim Miller.",

Ryan Reynolds' comedic timing and line delivery matches the character perfectly although I'm still having a hard time getting the Nolan North voice out of my head whenever I read a Deadpool comic. The action sequences are as violent as you'd expect from a Deadpool movie. The movie also has a surprising amount of dramatic moments which are balanced pretty well with the comedic moments. Good to see that not even the non-MCU Marvel movies are safe from Thanos. Long story short, Deadpool 2 lives up to its creative marketing campaign and the first film as well whilst also packing a few surprises along the way.",

Even with the upgraded production budget and different director, the film is a little jaded when it comes to the many supporting players, though the good news is the charatcres that do stand out make the most of what they got with the main character chewing up every scene he appears in. Other times, obscure background characters and performers are there, just because they're there and that the franchise could be pushed just a little more with a potential 3rd film. Overall, definitely worth the watch and just as enjoyable as it's previous counterpart in both form and glory.",

Searching to regain his spice for life, as well as a flux capacitor, Wade must battle ninjas, the yakuza, and a pack of sexually aggressive canines, as he journeys around the world to discover the importance of family, friendship, and flavor - finding a new taste for adventure and earning the coveted coffee mug title of World's Best Lover.\n\nOkay so coming off of \"Avengers: Infinity War\", superhero films are probably in for some competition, as the audience is coming in from seeing so many super powers in one place. And with that being said, I wish I saw this film before \"Avengers Infinity War\". Either way, this was a really fun installment and a really good follow up to the first \"Deadpool\". Even though I wasn't extremely excited for this film, I still had a lot of fun with it and there were plenty of really memorably moments.\n\nLet's talk about the humor / comedy. This film is filled with references and while that may be lazy to some people, it's genius. It's so hard to write a film that's basically all references, believe it or not. It's hard to execute it and actually make it universally funny. There are so many references that there's no way you'll be able to catch them all. But in general, I thought this film was hilarious. I haven't laughed this much in a movie theater in a long time and that says a lot. I was dying of laughter on more than one occasion. \n\nOne thing that lacked, as per the first \"Deadpool\" film, was the story. Goddamn while this movie was entertaining, the story was really bad. It was almost so bad that it took away from the entire experience at hand. The story was lazily written and there was never any real purpose to it. It gave up story in an expense for jokes and while it was undoubtedly hilarious, it was a bad story. Don't watch this film expecting a great narrative or anything because it certainly doesn't have that. \n\nThe actors were all really good. Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool is a match made in heaven. He's very charming and quick witted, making Deadpool such a memorable screen character. Josh Brolin, now starring in two superhero films back to back, did a fun job as Cable. Julian Dennison as Russell was a fun addition to the cast and everyone else from last time still put on strong performances. In general, everyone in this film did a great job and their comedic timing together is great. The entire cast has such great chemistry and they make the entire film so fun.\n\nIn the end, \"Deadpool 2\" was undeniably fun. It's a hilarious comedy and it was such a fun experience to have in the theaters. It's a great superhero film in an era where superhero films are starting to fatigue.",

            "content": "Three years ago Deadpool broke all the rules for a superhero movie. It was profanity laced, gruesomely violent, and absolutely filthy, with a hero who's a psychotic A-hole. A big departure from your usual all-ages fare. A lot of people weren't sure it could work. But it did. And it was awesome. And now the obligatory sequel is here, and it's even better.\n\nAs other writers more talented and original than me have pointed out, the first Deadpool was a test of whether an R-rated superhero movie could work, and was still figuring out the right balance of sex, violence, and language. Well now that the filmmakers know that the premise does work and have the basic formula down, they can run with it and have a lot of fun with it.\n\nAnd oh how much fun it is, from the opening jab at Wolverine to the fourth wall breaking post credit scenes. This time the fights are better, the villains are way better, and thankfully the lengthy, cringe inducing sex scenes from the first movie are gone. \nThey were funny yes, but also severely cringe inducing. Now there's still plenty of deeply offensive sexual humor, and it's all hilarious, but this time around they don't beat you over the head with it.\n\nAlthough lots of people do get beaten over the head. And shot. And stabbed. And blown up. And disemboweled and dismembered. Because it wouldn't be a Deadpool movie without somebody getting ripped in half now would it? And lots of pop culture references being dropped and the fourth wall getting broken. Which of course they are, and it is. By a school bus no less. There are also shameless rip-offs of iconic scenes of 80's cinema. And some pretty hilarious send ups of today's hypersensitive microaggressions culture. Let's see... Am I forgetting anything? Ah yes, the plot!\n\nAfter a great personal tragedy, Wade realizes he needs to get his heart in the right place- in more ways than one actually. He needs to find a family and do some good. So that means it's time to join the X-Men, which goes even worse than you would expect. But then he finds a new cause. A young troubled mutant with a serious attitude problem who maybe doesn't need or deserve Wade's help, but damned if he isn't going to get it anyway. All of this, besides being over the top violent and hilarious, is just the setup for his inevitable showdown (and equally inevitable team-up) with Cable.\n\nAnd for assembling the X-Force. They're great. Seriously. They're really awesome, badass, deeply dysfunctional people whose role in this movie is nothing like what the trailers suggest. I especially liked Domino. She's got some serious sass to go with her looks, and an excellent sense of dramatic and comedic timing. But nothing beats Josh Brolin as Cable. He is everything fans could have hoped for: tough as nails, ruthless yet professional, and absolutely deadpan in the face of Wade's constant quips. He's basically the anti-Deadpool, and the chemistry between them is as awesome as their prolonged fight scenes. I really hope he becomes a regular in this franchise.\n\nDespite Deadpool's claims to the contrary, this is definitely not a family movie, or one for the easily offended, or really anyone who isn't more than a little screwed up. But if you're OK with that it'll probably be the most fun you'll have at the movies all year. And don't miss the credits.",

Ryan Reynolds' passion project to claw his way back off of the B list paid off two years ago and proved to studios that yes, you can dial back the edgy realism and make a comic book film that eschews family friendliness for graphic language and violence. As if Family Guy had overdosed on nihilism and ultra-violence, Deadpool offered pop-culture onanism on Valentine's day for the unwashed masses, breaking the box office record for the largest opening of an R-rated feature. Finally, the cynicism and boredom of our murder obsessed society could huddle together and enjoy the lowest brows of entertainment in the context of manufactured childhood nostalgia.\n\nIn that regard, even if I didn't particularly enjoy the first film I could still respect it for pushing boundaries and seeming fresh in a film genre that fatigued me long before reviewers were buzz-wording \"franchise-fatigue\". There was a coy bleakness to the first one that, while it has no moral value and ultimately proved as disposable as the films it was lovingly satirizing, it was the exact kind of spirit one should approach a comic book movie with: this is crap, it doesn't matter, so have fun. If only lightning had struck twice I could have enjoyed this movie as well, but aside from a few jokes, I pretty much resented watching Van Wilder in spandex.\n\nNow Wade Wilson is ready to settle down and have kids, and \"this is a family film har-har\", and \"children give us a chance to be better than ourselves\" and other generic procreation propaganda. Those would be great as cannon fodder for our sardonic anti-hero, but instead they're just emo-signals for his pseudo-depth. Not for a moment do I buy any of these shoe-horned concepts emanating from goofy looking mass murderers, yet these lines are played in earnest as \"character development\". We get enough of these dinky character arcs in other films, so is it too much to ask that they just cut the bullshit in this franchise?\n\nAs for the technical aspects, director David Leitch has demonstrated his action genre stylings quite well in John Wick and Atomic Blonde, but here he showcases his contrived sense of emotional motivation. Plus it looks like he was phoning in most of the fight choreography. It's just the same old tricks with none of the flair, and when the Dung fu stops, the generic CG set pieces pick up the lack of pace. There's nothing fresh here, just more of the same. I won't lie though, if you still bust a gut watching the first one, you will probably find yourself completely satisfied with this movie, like eating McDonalds when you're drunk at 4 AM, or flushing a cockroach down the toilet.",

            "content": "Is black humor a racist disposition, Mr. Deadpool?\n\nIrascible, Wade Wilson and his, sulfuric one hundred percent, alter ego \"Dead,\" landed in the domestic and overseas cinemas at the hands of 20th Century Fox in early 2016 and were a freshly deadpan breath of life for superhero genre; Tim Miller debuted as a filmmaker with a feature film sparing nobody, in which irreverence, spoof- and self-parody too,- meta-cinematographic language and an immeasurable wit between the minimal cast made up a high-powered origin/romance film that opens new territories for Marvel Studios in a more or less similar way as \"Guardians\" by James Gunn or \"Black Panther\" by Ryan Coogler did, while simultaneously carrying the lacerated hope of many fans in its hands, who begged, from DC's \"Watchmen\" by Zack Snyder, for a rated-R adaptation of Marvel Comics, they got it. No big or small idea is safe at Hollywood mecca, no breakout hit between critics and audience is immune to put a new franchise over it, this was no exception. Nonetheless, this was what his lead and main promoter, Ryan Reynolds, was looking for all this time and due to his character is open and has the capacity for a fairly-coherent franchise, the return of the Merc with a mouth took two years to be a reality. It's finally here, going head first with the quasi-excellent event \"Infinity War,\" released less than a month ago. There's enough material to be considered as an unusual follow-up, from its laconic and unambitious title \"Deadpool 2,\" it's understood that everyone knows who he is, to the preservation of the production low-budget, They're trivial attributes on the surface, but actually allow to observe the huge appreciation and respect on the part of its creators for a high-opportunity work in which there's more violence, causticity, special characters and Hollywood-indie entertainment, while it forgets on its full-of-jokes storytelling the brilliantly unique and innovative touches that made the first movie a vicious, laughing-out-loud must-watch.\n\n\nI'm not sure if Deadpool would fit into Marvel Studios' new rising canon in relation to the recent billionaire contract between companies, hence the aggressive and abrasive superhero shines out in a simple, direct plot. The screenplay is written by Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick - two screenwriters from the first installment - and Reynolds himself, the story decides to develop itself within the limits fixed by the previously selected genres, resting, as could not be otherwise, on the scarred shoulders of the red-and-black hero. Nonetheless, this is a far-seeing second film, which allows nearly fifteen additional characters to be included in a split second, opting for a quintet/sextet - is Dopinder, the taxi driver and faithful squire, on the team? - that lays the groundwork for what will be their standalone film - cough, new franchise, cough,- X-Force. The exposition of the daring group is irregular because they don't present in their own movie, a fact that caused the writers to compact the materials organically without deflecting from the plot focus; having said that, watching them working on the screen isn't as magnetic and special as one would expect, but they produce enough charm to sympathize with each of them. The incorruptible morale of Colossus, voiced by Stefan Kapicic, and the commendable CGI effort bring a strong and fantastic counterpoint to our hero because they compose a ridiculously genuine bromance; Zazie Beetz's Domino doesn't reach Valkyrie's empowered female impact, but defends its lucky storyline by means of a sincere and distant acting development that falls apart trying to fill the impression she couldn't cause - it's respectful not include in the final footage the sequence led by her stunt double, Joi \"SJ\" Harris, after the tragedy that took place on 14 August last year; - Taika Waititi's big Kiwi revelation, who portrays Russell, is one of the characters who gains an important background and dramatic development, which helps him become a vital handle to the general plot by means of a plausible, emotional and, to tell the truth, quite realistic performance; as a mutant, Firefist is the spirited new youth incorporation in the clan, it'd be interesting to see how it would develop his storyline in a story in which he and his burning hands become part of a team; Nathan Summers' time travels are truly wasted - save the epic and meta-narrative post-credits scene - for large-scale situations, they're never used as an instrument in storytelling, are simply an input/output mechanism for a half-human, half-machine-and-armament hero; in the same way, its introduction is tremendously indecisive and ineffective, with a flat and out-of-place edition delivering short, insubstantial glimpses about the next member of the gang. However, ever-fierce Josh Brolin endows Cable, the most long-awaited new character by the fanatics, with virility and overwhelming visual portent, his scenes expel physical and mental strength, not excluding a subtle emergence of comedy through his unwavering and austere personality; And last but not least: Deadpool. The actor from \"Green Lantern -\" I'm sorry, I had to do it - found what Hugh Jackman and Tom Cruise found in Wolverine and Ethan Hunt respectively: the role by which he'll be recognized for the rest of his career. The naturalness, dynamism, vigor and passion impregned by the Canadian interpreter are really a cracker, the irreverence and comicalness of this fella, who had been pursuing these movies since his failed incorporation in  \"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\", reveal how much hard work he did, every line  coming from his mouth, adorned with his characteristic gestures that aren't hidden under the suit, is cruel, dramatic and hilarious; it's incredible the power his performance has to know how to handle the rhythm throughout the film and the exact moment of each parodic insertion leaning on a brutal script. No doubt, this highly-anticipated sequel never loses sight of its raison d'\u00eatre, providing an authentic, entertaining story, which is open to receive the incessant jokes coming from the screenplay. Ryan Reynolds is killing it as Deadpool.  \n\nThe narrative gets a surreal tone at the hands of an unexpected and very well executed move starring by Morena Baccarin's Vanessa. Every film is an independent imitation of reality, a fiction, but the budget of the first film made the story was much more adhered to the argumentative environment of TV series such as \"Daredevil\" or \"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\" that Marvel's worldwide and space mega-events, however, the sequel deals with some sort of out-of-body journey - in heaven? - that although they allow development in a dynamic and very different way in the face of the previous film, sometimes they hurt the tone and pace of the movie seriously, losing the focus among so many narrative tools the writers stuff in the plot.\n\n\nIt's increasingly obvious the writing of the screenplay was more complicated than you thought, as shaping the hilarious dialogues for the anti-hero demands inventiveness from more than one brain. Reese, Wernick, and Reynolds stick thousands, thousands, thousands of references, not just as the usual easter-eggs game. Pop-culture is key, the endless mentions on screen through one-liners are sickeningly amusing thanks to our strange time. No-one and nothing can get away from the vicious signs: literature (Pericles), music (dubstep), singers (Cher and Justin Bieber), actors (Jackman and, oh!, Reynolds), of course film (\"Star Wars,\" DC, Marvel, 007's \"Spectre,\" \"John Wick\" and a long etcetera), and even the movie conception itself, laughing at the writing process, the  production companies, its screenwriters and director through an unforgettable meta-cinematographic language. Such was the impact that I began to hyperventilate, picking references that maybe were never deliberately introduced by the screenwriters (\"Spy\" by Paul Feig or \"Inception\" by Nolan). Hands down, the film with more explicitly-implanted-in-the-script pop-culture references I have ever seen.     \n\n\nIt's sad to admit, but fourth wall breaking decreases in impact and number. It's an understandable decision because this time our hero isn't alone, but the movie should find ways and new narrative incursions which replace the role that played this brilliant technique. However, the few are short and don't get the importance they deserve, yes, we still have his peculiar voice-over monologues maneuvering anachronistically the story and mocking even the smallest detail, but they never bridge the gap of those long and hilarious soliloquies and conversations he held with the audience as a narrative mechanism with tremendous effectiveness.\n\n\nIt'd be demoralizing to say that, after the titanic and classical work put into \"Infinity War\" with regard to the creation, treatment, and exposition of its villains, Marvel has taken a step back, sorry, somehow it did. All right, Ed Skrein's Ajax isn't the best Marvel villain of all time, but it's neither the worst because he gives it a proper development and time enough on screen to make the viewer understand who the bad guy in the movie is, however, on this occasion, there is no a delimited antagonist. Obviously, most viewers buy a ticket to see their favorite hero do and undo, but it's important to know if whoever gets such punches- curse words in this case -has managed to involve with the audience and the story, here, none of that happened of course. Villain's role changes so many times that, in the end, the course of events seems disoriented; firstly, Cable would become a pain in the neck for the antihero according to the script, however, thanks to a shrewd plot twist, Mr. Nathan gives up his seat to two more characters, a yo-yo move that doesn't favor and ends up giving the perception there is no real villain, perhaps, the only baddie is Deadpool. \n\n\nThis installment had the chance to remedy the lack of spectacle in the mise-en-sc\u00e8ne and the exposition of the largest and most expensive set-pieces, however, even with a highly qualified stunt coordinator, you never get something really epic matching tremendous levels of violence with some kind of visual beauty. Stuntman-turned-filmmaker David Leitch is known for what \"John Wick\" is recognized as a cult-film today: its fierce, brutal, meticulously choreographed combats. Although it's evident an upsurge in less-artificial fighting scenes and comically bloody sequences, none of these serves to mask a lackluster visual buffet, in the last, lacking styled compositions that leave you astounded, doing no justice to the exquisite visuals and action in \"JW\" and \"Atomic Blonde,\" the two previous works of the filmmaker. Jonathan Sela's cinematography handles intelligent and frankly striking angles, but he never ventures to pass the limits over and decides to settle with a couple of laudable sequences that always shine under the shadow of the well-made fights in the first flick, I find it somewhat strange, especially taking into account who its director is, not even the final sequence which draws its strengths on the always-funny performances and the unbeatable screenplay. There are similarities in a specific sequence, one that many remember from Miller's pic for the misuse of special effects, yes, the one in which Wade Wilson is kicking asses along a freeway as an opening scene, here, it's Domino who must withstand an embarrassing set-piece, it's unheard of the poorly-achieved digital effects it must endure, it seems as if the crew had forgotten to finish it and had decided to release it that way, the scenes aren't realistic at all, it looks like a 2000's video game. Tyler Bates doesn't do a sincerely rewarding feat as his \"soundtrack\" for the film vomits hyperactive and energetic melodies over the frames, that don't contribute anything to the visual part to excel. The only original song which can really monopolize the spotlights soon is 'Ashes ' interpreted by the queen Celine Dion, one which is used, covertly, more than once. \n\n\n\"Deadpool 2\" by David Leitch unimpeachably dynamizes only some of the features which made the first movie so freestanding, unusually special and extravagant while neglecting aspects of cardinal importance as a good approach to the characters, a stunning visual section and a deep, conscious development and treatment to a powerful villain. But don't worry, you'll get more vicious action, trenchant jokes and one-liners, visual gags, a new volatile group of heroes, many, many references of all kinds and an experience that does not disappoint, but what's a Wade Wilson/Ryan Reynolds who gets his long-awaited sequel where the only thing that matters is the surface? By the way, did I leave the stove on?",

This personal pursuit served its purpose as the moral backbone, and worked well as a counterbalance to the irreverence and violence, but it isn't why I bought my ticket and it isn't what anyone will leave the theater talking about.\n\nThe movie is at its best when it takes a simple comedy bit and extends it to its full, absurd, jaw dropping potential. When talking to friends who had also seen it over its opening weekend, the moments we raced each other to mention were: X-Force's demise, Deadpool's baby legs, and that incredible post credits scene where Deadpool decides to correct a few of Marvel's timeline issues.\n\nUnless you are not a fan of Reynolds, Marvel, or can't handle the rated R stuff, go see it.",

He is compelling and likable in the burn make-up as without.  There is no commitment too big or small to make for a funny line or humorous situation.  There was no hesitancy to bring humor to the forefront even if for only a joke.  References to other parts of the MDU,  the DCEU and Current events stand out.   The supporting cast is varied and large.  They do a good job but the numbers prevent a lot of depth being revealed on the new players.

            "content": "I must confess I love a sarcastic, irreverent take on the tired and ubiquitous superhero genre, so I find the fearlessness and freshness of the first Deadpool rather endearing. In this inevitable sequel where the element of surprise has gone, it has doubled down on its cartoonish violence and adolescent (c)rudeness, but what's unexpected is the script also reveals a softer side with more heart this time round, whilst preserving its signature potty mouth, fourth wall breaking, cultural reference making, rat-a-tat-tat wise cracking; and I reckon they've even stolen bits of Logan's narrative structure to do this. How meta! Ryan Reynolds' passion holds the film together once again proving there is no Deadpool without him and the introduction of Josh Brolin's Cable and Zazie Beetz's Domino are well handled and casted. The first 30 mins of the film is so packed with exposition and one-liners, it's almost exhausting trying to keep up with them but it soon settles in for a smoother, probably more conventional but nonetheless funny and entertaining ride. David Leitch (who directed John Wick), is great with the exhilarating action sequences but he seems a little stiffer with the comedic scenes. Ultimately, the film works best, and brings the big laughs, when it is blatantly messing up conventions and takes unexpected turns in its almost reckless storytelling while taking the proverbial piss. Without going into spoilers, for every mean and gruesome, limbs dislocating and politically incorrect gag or twist that hits, there is a more conventional one that pulls the film back into its superhero box. So while there's still a lot of fun and mileage to be had in this franchise, it is only going to get harder in the future to please an audience who expects, and perhaps even demands, the unexpected.",

            "content": "\"Greatest sequel since The Godfather 2\" is the biggest joke ever.\n\nDeadpool 2 was quite disappointing from a Deadpool perspective. The film had its moments but it lost the 4th wall breaking elements.\n\nIts kind of a contrast to the original film. The original film didn't have a well written story but it was filled with dirty jokes and 4th wall breaking but this film lost it all but improved on its story. I guess with the story and it's emotional impact, they didn't know how to include the 4th wall breaking. Pop culture references are not 4th wall breaking, period.\n\nThe soundtrack was also terrible compared to the original Deadpool film. Skrillex, really? Aside from Ashes and Tomorrow, most of the songs are pretty mediocre and doesn't really fit the scenes in which they were played. But I did enjoy the hell out of the James Bond theme song opening parody. And why is Papa Can You Hear Me not included in the soundtrack?\n\nCable's portrayal was spot on, loved the dynamic he had with Wade. But due to obvious reasons, every time Cable speaks, I just hear Thanos. But his chemistry with Domino was terrible. This isn't Brolin's fault. I am unable to understand the casting choice of Domino. Its not because she's black but because she looks nothing like her comic counterpart.\n\nFirst of all, Domino's albino skin is not because Domino was born white or whatever but it's because of her mutation, that made her skin pale and her eye black. But the film reversed that and made Zazie look much more terrible. If Zoe Saldana can portray Gamora with green skin, I don't see why Zazie can't portray Domino with white skin.\n\nI was looking forward to more of Negasonic Longest Name Ever, but she was barely on screen. The film tried hard to be good but just wasn't. Dopinder's extended role was nice to see though.\n\nI'm very disappointed with Deadpool 2. Really expected a lot better. The film is clearly catered for a younger audience. The jokes are less dirty compared to the first. The film is great as a normal superhero film but failed as a Deadpool film.\n\nFavourite Quote: Dubstep's for pussies. (Cause it is)",

            "content": "I was lukewarm at best on the first Deadpool film when I watched it a few weeks ago, so I wasn\u2019t sure if there was any hope for this sequel. However, Deadpool 2 improved on the original in almost every way imaginable. For one thing, this movie takes the fourth-wall breaking and self-referential humor to another level. It seems there isn\u2019t a single scene that goes by where he isn\u2019t referencing something outside of this movie. I\u2019m sure this will hurt its staying power over time as those references become dated, but I was laughing like crazy in the theater so I don\u2019t care. I will offer the one qualifier that comedies tend to work better when you\u2019re around other people who are laughing with you, so seeing Deadpool on video alone versus seeing Deadpool 2 in a crowded theater might have played a part in my enjoyment. But I\u2019m still convinced the jokes were thought out better this time around, and there are so many more that I can remember and reference days later. The action in Deadpool 2 is superb, and the CGI was used to great effect. You can see every penny of the budget on screen in this film. I still think Colossus doesn\u2019t look great, but they had to match him to the first film, so at least they are consistent. One of my favorite aspects of Deadpool 2 was how they subverted expectations. I don\u2019t want to go into too much detail, but there were things that they do here that most studio films in a cinematic universe would never dare to do. It was ballsy and hilarious. Plus, because it\u2019s Deadpool and time travel comes into play thanks to Cable, I\u2019m not worried that they\u2019ve burned all bridges and can\u2019t go back. Speaking of Cable, I think he was a nice addition to the film. The way they use him in the plot is excellent, and Josh Brolin played him straight which is a nice contrast to wacky Deadpool. However, it was Domino that stole the show. Every scene with Zazie Beetz was better just because she was there. There is one flaw that this sequel shares with the original Deadpool, and that is simplicity and predictability of the plot. While there are moments and sequences that don\u2019t go as you would expect, the overall story arc is not a shocking one. It\u2019s easy to forgive the simple plot when it\u2019s so clear the movie is more interested in making you laugh than telling a complex story. I like all the appearances of familiar X-Men characters, some obscure and some more well-known. I\u2019m not sure all the humor around those characters will play as well for people who haven\u2019t read any of the X-comics, but I enjoyed a lot of them even though I haven\u2019t bought a new comic in decades. If you disliked Deadpool because of the vulgarity and comical violence, then Deadpool 2 won\u2019t change your mind. As for me, I was genuinely surprised by this movie, and enjoyed it way more than I expected. It has some narrative flaws, but they were easy to overlook because I was laughing hysterically the whole time.",

Deadpool 2 revels in an extensive smorgasbord of references and Easter eggs from pop culture, comics, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the DC Extended Universe, the X-Men movies, and plenty more. Nothing is untouchable for this movie -- not even its own predecessor. Consistently reminiscing about old jokes, reinstating the ole familiar, lovable supporting characters who deliver more of the same.....Dissecting the movie to its bones, if it were not for Cable's presence and storyline, the film would bear a striking resemblance to the first Deadpool. It is not necessarily detrimental for a sequel to draw heavily from the style and tone of the original, but there are moments in this film where redundancy tends to stick out. The new material is reassuring though. Simply put, Cable is awesome, and Josh Brolin proves to be a fantastic casting choice. However, Cable's purpose and role here ultimately seem to become no more significant than those of Colossus or Vanessa. The movie is justified in retaining its focus on Deadpool/Wade Wilson, but considering how substantial of a character Cable is/has been, centering the focal point and leveling the attention between these two characters may have been a missed opportunity for this film to reinforce its ability to stand apart from its predecessor. Overall, the film's primary focus and plethora of verbal and visual gags/references set aside, this is a commendable follow-up with enough quotable dialogue and rambunctious, explosive, gory fun to make it a good time. As with the first Deadpool, this sequel has its heart in the right place. Anyone who liked the first movie will like this one.",

This movie is hilarious, and Deadpool is not Deadpool without his pop culture references. You will be giggling the whole time. It brings the same fire from the first film. This time around, Ryan Reynolds' alter ego Deadpool has a deeper purpose than just being everybody's favorite anti-hero. It is all about family, and yes, even amidst all of the gore you will witness while watching this. I actually was not fond of how the beginning was executed. It all made sense, but it was not necessary to show it that way. The filmmakers managed to fit a lot into the film. They included not one, but possibly three villains. Cable is the most notable one, but he got his redemption at the end. Every great film has a great villain. With the element of family incorporated into the story, Cable is motivated by his family's death to stop Russell Collins from making his first kill, and his reason being that if Russell was to kill now, he will do more damage in the future. His heart is in the right place, but his solution to the problem is not, which obviously makes him the bad guy. I am satisfied with Josh Brolin's portrayal of Cable, but Cable's turnaround is very abrupt. In fact, the film gets in touch with more emotions than you would expect. At times, it did not feel natural as to how sappy it became. From start to finish, Deadpool 2 is packed with nicely choreographed action scenes. The movie very well integrates itself into real life but loses its touch once the scene features too much CGI. Overall, Deadpool 2 returns with better jokes, more blood, and an abundant amount of emotion that are added onto its action-packed story.\n\n---\nfollow https://www.instagram.com/movietvstance/",

The closest I've come to that 'superhero fatigue' feeling came when I exited 'Avengers: Age of Ultron.' \"That was fine,\" I remember saying. \"It just seemed like an arc of a monthly superhero comic.\" A good arc (that film holds up well) but just another chapter in a big-budget soap opera.\n\nDeadpool 2 felt like a story arc of a monthly superhero book. This time, I mean that in the best sense possible. You see, the insane, whiplash-inducing tone of this picture is deeply rooted in the Deadpool source material. Those books aren't - and can't be - as explicit in their humor, but there is a ribald streak there, along with the fourth-wall-breaking, the time travel, the ultra-violence. This film strikes that tone just as well as it's predecessor. The fun part, for me, was to see that sensibility clash more fully with the larger X-Men universe, replete with it's melodramatic fists-to-heaven pathos. Honestly, the boilerplate tearjerker beats do manage to jerk tears. This movie is a super-hero confection, for sure - but it's one of those 'mega super sour  i-dare-you-to-suck-on-it' jawbreakers.\n\nThe laughs and the action ought to satisfy general audiences (NOT children - come ON, people at my screening.

            "content": "Last night the Nelnie and I took in the latest superhero film that isn't Avengers related, Deadpool 2. Being big fans of the first film we were anxiously awaiting the inevitable sequel to drop after two long years. In between that time such films as Wonder Woman and Logan have dropped. So has Black Panther, which is another film I can't understand the hype of. Logan and Wonder Woman were entertaining, Black Panther was just long and confusing. \nDeadpool 2 combines some of those elements.\n\nIf you've seen Deadpool 1, don't go into this film expecting to see anything groundbreaking. This is a retread just with a different bad guy. \n\nSpoilers: Deadpool 2 picks up some time after the first film with the Merc With a Mouth going international, shinging his way across the globe. Then he comes home to Vanessa who has an incredibly short part in this film, although the reason for that is a big plot point. \nSo Deadpool gets arrested for trying to save some kid and is taken to a mantha torture center for mutants. He and the kid are locked up, but unknown to them, Cable (Josh Brolin) is out to kill the kid. Ballwarz and teabagging ensue and the plot moves forward...\n\nHere are some things I took away from this film in comparison to the first one.\nDeadpool 1 was a lot funnier. The jokes came in almost every scene. For #2, the film's tone has shifted considerably to more of a drama with moments (not enough) of comedy sprinkled through. I wonder, had Tim Miller stayed on as director, if this would have been closer to the first film.\nDeadpool 2 is a lot busier character wise. There are still the staples from Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead but there's also now Cable, Domino, and a assorted others who round out the cast. Blind Al and the bartender guy are back although neither are as funny as they were.\nDeadpool 2 feels longer. Wah might look at her watch during this film if she ever sees it in the theater. It isn't necessarily slow, just longer.\nDeadpool 2 doesn't feel as fresh as the first film, nor is it anywhere near as funny as I already mentioned.\nI kind of felt like this was forced, as if they were trying way too hard. Maybe Deadpool should have remained a one off film. However, with the box office take of the sequel, I'm pretty sure we're going to see Deadpool 3. As of this writing, the film surpassed Avengers: Infinity Ballwarz but it hasn't overtaken Passion of The Mantha Torture Center like the film mentions it wants to. I'm sure it will with overseas markets. With Hands So-Low coming out next week, I expect these two to go head to head (and butt to butt). \n\nLike the beginning credits said, I didn't expect nor necessarily care for the huge event that happens within the first five minutes. Granted that event is fixed by an end credit sequence (spoiler), but I still think they could have gone with a better story. Josh Brolin did good but he's not much of a comedy actor and that shows, although I think that had more to do with character than anything else. \nWould I own it? Probably, simply because the first film was so much fun.\nWould I watch it regularly? Probably not as much.\nWould my wife still fall asleep during it and snore? Yes she would.\n\nDeadpool 2 gets 3 stars out of 5. It's entertaining but does not come anywhere near the first film in terms of quality and comedy. Ryan can do better. I do admit the end credits are funny, and the film has its moments, just... as I said before, not enough.",

Hell, even Russell is just a bad copy cat of his character from Hunt for the Wilderpeople, but without any depth or heart. I never know why to care for any of it. Why is killing a kid off the limits, but murdering everyone else without questioning their level of evil ok? Or letting his X-Force die as a gag? No idea. If the kid was tortured his whole life but escaped at 19, would it then be ok to kill him? If Deadpool can go to heaven and remember it, what does that mean for the world at large? Does his death scene matter if we've already seen him die and go to heaven three times? This movie tells you right off the bat it doesn't care so you shouldn't, so have a good time...but the reason the first one worked is that it was a solid story on top of real characters WITH all the humor and meta commentary.

From recent memory, the only other film that comes close-besides the first Deadpool-was last year's 'Baby Driver.'\n\nThe film's dialogue is packed with movie references, nods at pop culture, and even jokes at Ryan Reynold's own expense, so much so that a second viewing would absolutely be necessary to try and catch them all.\n\nThe movie isn't perfect.  For example, the first half of Cable's storyline feels a bit disjointed from the rest of the film.  However, it steadily becomes increasingly well integrated over time.\n\nHowever, for a franchise that prides itself on violent irreverence, it'd be unthinkable to assume that they were capable of making audiences well up with emotion at the end, yet they had the entire theater choking back tears, a rare achievement that strongly rounds out this film and places amongst the best in its class.",

Dialogue lacked that swagger and charm the original had. The plot really takes a backseat in this movie and that I think hurts it the most. While the original was cliche it was also solid. I feel this movie would have been a 5 stars had the followed a plot then sprinkled the humor.

Since becoming Deadpool two year ago, Wade Wilson (Reynolds) has been an international mercenary taking out the worse criminals in the world. After letting a bad guy get away, Wade is heartbroken when the love of his life Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) is killed. Feeling that he just can\u2019t live without her, Wade tries to kill himself, which is, of course, unsuccessful because of his mutant power of self-healing. At the X-Men mansion where he is recovering after Colossus literally picked up the pieces, Wade reluctantly tells Colossus (voiced of Stefan Kapi\u010di\u0107) & Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) that he will try joining the X-Men. The trio is called upon to respond to a standoff situation between authorities & a troubled young mutant named Russell Collins/Firefist (Hunt for the Wilderpeople\u2019s Julian Dennison). When Wade learns that Russell has been abused by the staffers at the Mutant Reeducation Center, he kills one of the staff members which unfortunately has him & Russell arrested & disabled with collars that disarm their powers. They are sent to an isolated mutant prison known as the \u201cIcebox.\u201d Wade & Russell soon encounter a soldier from the future named Cable (Josh Brolin) who has traveled back in time to eliminate Collins preventing him from becoming a blood-thirsty killer. After having a vision of Vanessa who tells him that he needs to help the troubled boy, Wade forms a team of mutants known as X-Force: Domino (Zazie Beetz), Vanisher (Brad Pitt), Bedlam (Terry Crews), Zeitgeist (IT\u2019s Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd) to name a few, to save Russell from being killed by Cable. Directed David Leitch from a screenplay written by Ryan Reynolds, Rhett Reese & Paul Werhick, Deadpool 2 is outrageously entertaining with amazing action scenes & twisted humor that had me laughing throughout the film. This is just me, but I actually thought that Deadpool 2 was better than the original film, which was great. Deadpool 2 also features Shioli Kutsuna as Yukio, Negasonic Teenage Warhead's girlfriend, she joins returning cast members T.J. Miller as Weasel, Leslie Uggams as Blind Al & Karan Soni as Dopinder the cab driver. The performances from the cast were excellent, full of heart & emotion. There are several very funny scenes during the end credits so be sure to stay for those. There is so much going on in Deadpool 2 that you will have to see it again to catch the little nuggets that you missed the first time. Deadpool 2 is a MUST-SEE FILM of the summer.",

The usual issue with sequels is the tired attempt to recapture the lightening of the first by recycling jokes and Deadpool is no exception. The best part of the film is the X force team launching into action, one of the funniest segments created. The new characters breathe life into a franchise that didn't necessarily require it, but it will ensure the future of the franchise has direction. I'm reserving my complete judgement until the DVD release but this franchise is still going strong and is definitely a bold and bright choice by the filmmakers, hopefully Disney don't ruin this character. 19/05/2018.\nJust caught the super duper version and the film while being hilarious at times, fails to ignite a flame that distances itself away from the first film.

Nous l'avons vu, on vous donne notre avis... sans spoil.\n\nIl avait fait sensation en 2016, Wade Wilson est de retour cette ann\u00e9e charg\u00e9 \u00e0 bloc dans un nouvel opus de la franchise Deadpool. Le casting au complet remet le couvert en y int\u00e9grant de petits nouveaux comme Zazie Beetz dans le r\u00f4le de la chanceuse Domino, Terry Crews en Bedlam, Julian Dennison est Russell, Shioli \u00ab Bisou Yukio ! \u00bb Kutsuna, Josh \u00ab Thanos \u00bb Brolin et... Peter. On notera des cam\u00e9os d\u00e9lirants tout au long du film dont un certain Phantom, mais on ne vous en dira pas plus.\n\nDans les grandes lignes, l'histoire nous fait suivre Wade contraint de prot\u00e9ger un adolescent geignard \u00ab XXL, comme il est dit \u00bb qui est prit pour cible par Cable, un myst\u00e9rieux homme venu du futur. Deadpool y versera beaucoup de sang et de membres dans des sc\u00e8nes d'actions toniques et parfois tr\u00e8s gores.\n\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 action justement, les amateurs de boum boum et de chor\u00e9graphies en auront largement pour leur argent avec de magnifiques combats et un budget revu \u00e0 la hausse. Budget qui manque par contre au niveau des effets visuels de certains personnages enti\u00e8rement fait en CGI.\n\n\u00c9gal \u00e0 lui-m\u00eame, Deadpool s'en prend \u00e0 toutes les firmes de comics que ce soit Marvel ou DC Comics, mais \u00e9galement \u00e0 son interpr\u00e8te principal. Batman, Wolverine, Green Lantern et les X-Men en prennent plein la figure avec un Wade Wilson en pleine forme.\n\nPour conclure, Deadpool 2 est bien le film que l'on attendait avec son humour d\u00e9capant. Les cam\u00e9os sont hilarants, tout comme les personnages secondes qui malheureusement n'ont que tr\u00e8s peu de r\u00e9plique. On regrettera que certains personnages principaux n'apparaissent pas plus \u00e0 l'\u00e9cran comme Negasonic Teenage Warhead et Yukio (Bisou Yukio !) qui ont un gros potentiel en esp\u00e9rant les voir de retour dans le film X-Force. Ce second film met donc les bouch\u00e9es doubles mais ne fait pas dans le \u00ab too much \u00bb car il explore suffisamment les personnages de Cable et Wade Wilson pour \u00e9quilibrer entre les s\u00e9rieux et les blagues potaches de notre ami en rouge et noir. Bref, un excellent opus qui ravira les fans du premier film mais aussi les lecteurs du comics.",

            "content": "After watching this film I can say two things, Ryan Reynolds was born to play this role and R-rated superhero films are absolutely kick-ass. 'Deadpool 2', much like the first, knows exactly what type of film it's trying to be and absolutely owns it. It's quite definite now that the first installment was not a fluke and I am already eager to see Reynolds back on screen as Deadpool again. The film opens with a moment that was very surprising and took me well off guard. This is a spoiler free review but I will say that what happens early on in the film offers our hero a new challenge on many different levels. That's what sequels are all about, giving the main character challenges greater than in the first, and the writers did that perfectly. I will say when I found out director Tim Miller was not returning to direct this sequel I was nervous for where it would go and if the tone would stay the same. When I discovered David Leitch (director of 'John Wick' and 'V for Vendetta') was set to helm the sequel my worries disappeared, and rightfully so. Leitch completely embraces the tone from the first film and did an incredible job directing this movie. He did such a good job that I hope to see him back at the helm of another potential 'Deadpool' film down the road. \nThe film is flat-out hilarious, one of the reasons the first movie was so much fun was because of its sheer dark comedy and that was back in full force in the sequel. 'Deadpool 2' was extremely funny and it made for yet another fun time at the movies. Keep in mind, not all the one liners in this movie land perfectly and that is expected in a film like this, but overall there is not much of a gripe regarding that. 'Deadpool 2' is able to do something that it didn't do in the first - a balance of heart and comedic tone. Let's face it, these films thrive when it's time for some comedy but this film was able to adapt a more serious, emotionally touching tone than the first and it brought Reynolds' character, 'Wade Wilson', down to earth a little. \n\n\nThe rest of the cast in the movie did an incredibly good job. Josh Brolin as 'Cable' was bad-ass to see on screen. It felt like it took a little while for Brolin to actually start kicking ass in this film but whenever he is on screen, he is quite entertaining. I felt as if the movie should've explored 'Cable' a little more but as the movie progresses you do learn more about this character and it was fulfilling in that way. Zazie Beetz as 'Domino' in this film was rather good and she provides some good action sequences as well as some subtle wit. 'Colossus' and 'Negasonic' are both great in this movie as their characters continued from the first movie, but I wished they explored these characters a little more. I personally found Julian Dennison who plays 'Russell Collins/Firefist' to be the one clear weak spot in this film acting-wise. His role in the film is rather important as he pieces together the big challenge that Reynolds must face but I did not like their chemistry nor did I enjoy his isolated moments in the movie. \n'Deadpool 2' got a huge increase in budget from the first film so this movie was clearly a much more extravagant and CGI centered film but there were times when two CGI characters went head to head that I did not fully buy into the special effects being used and I won't go as far to say that it took me out of the film, but it was a notable weakness. The rest of the action sequences in this film are awesome. Much like the first movie, there is gore... and a lot of it. The fight scenes in this movie with Brolin and Reynolds are ridiculously awesome and quite a lot of fun to watch.",

            "content": "I'll start off and be completely honest in saying that I thoroughly enjoyed the first Deadpool film, but wasn't blown away or busting a gut laughing from start to finish. The meta jokes were fantastic and the story itself was even quite engaging, but it wore thin for me by the third act. That being said, I found myself hoping that a sequel would be even better. Deadpool 2 has just hit the big screen, and while I can't say it's a funnier movie, I can say the film itself is a vast improvement when looking at the filmmaking alone. This movie does a good job of creating new jokes and even making old jokes funny again, but there's something about these movies that has me having a hard time falling in love with them. Here's why Deadpool 2 comes highly recommended for fans, but not at all for anyone else.\n\nQuite a few plot devices are used here, but without getting to any spoilers, Deadpool 2 follows Wade Wilson once again, as he feels the need to protect a young boy with superpowers, while a time-traveling mutant in Cable is one the rise, hunting this boy down. From realizing that he may just work better with partners, to realizing that he may love more than just himself, there are a lot of storylines and emotional aspects that elevate this from another average superhero comedy. I found myself shocked to see how much time was spent on action or drama, instead of the need to always joke around. Yes, this movie is riddled with humor from start to finish, but this felt like a more mature version of the previous film.\n\nAs far as the humor itself goes, I mentioned that I quite enjoyed what they did with the first movie, but felt that it wore out by the end. This time around, the jokes felt a little more spread out, which is why I believe they worked better here, so I could catch a breath and not be hounded with excessive amounts of comedy. You may actually feel differently about that because there are jokes throughout certain dramatic moments, but I chose to see it as a dramatic moment, rather than a comedic one. So I was pleasantly surprised to see a nice blend of those two genres.\n\nRyan Reynolds continues to prove that he was born to play this role. Not many actors/actresses can prove that they were meant to act in a specific role, but Reynolds is definitely one of the few who can. It goes without saying that his heart is in these movies until the very end, so how was the supporting cast? Josh Brolin delivers a solid performance as Cable, but I feel as though he comes out of nowhere during the beginning of the movie. I felt a little short-changed in terms of his development. His screen time vastly increases by the end and made his character worth it, but I still wished to see a little more from him.\n\nEveryone has been seeing images and footage in the trailers for the tease at the X-Force team that Deadpool recruits here, and I can say that their screen time is easily one of the highlights of the entire film. Looking back on the movie, the character of Domino (played by Zazie Beetz) is easily my favorite in the entire film. Her ability is hilarious and very unique in combat, and each of these characters just added another level to the movie, whether they were shining in an action sequence, or just there to make the audience laugh, or leave them shocked.\n\nIn the end, I enjoyed this sequel just as much as its predecessor. I thought the first movie lacked a tone that this one presented, but the comedy will impress viewers more in the first film, so there is a balance that really has me debating which one I liked more. Deadpool 2 benefits from very solid direction from David Leitch and the fact that Ryan Reynolds joined writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick made it feel a little different from the first. The first movie was a celebration that a movie like this could be made, but this one dives a little deeper and I quite enjoyed that about it. While I don't love either of these movies, they are a blast to watch. Deadpool 2 has its issues, but it's a solid movie all around.",

Ryan Reynolds continues his brilliant turn as Deadpool, delivering one-liners faster than a machine gun while giving a real warmth & character arc to him (he really isn't lying when he says this film is about family).  The cast is nicely fleshed out as well, with Josh Brolin nicely menacing as Cable while Zazi Beetz is fun as Domino.  Behind the camera, director David Leitch uses his action movie prowess to great affect, delivering some brilliantly choreographed set pieces that, like his 'John Wick' films, rely on longer takes and a pulled back camera.  The film is also filled with numerous cameos and fourth-wall breaks that will require multiple viewings to catch them all, along with one of the best post-credit scenes to date.  Most importantly, despite all the gory action & humor, there is a genuine heart to the film that gives Deadpool a real heroes journey.  Simply put, a film that not surpasses it's sequel, thus being one of the best comic book movies ever made.",

You know, like when you were a kid and something silly made you giggle in to a fit of uncontrollable laughter. That is the caliber of comedy this movie has in spades, diamonds, clubs, and.... hearts.\n\nWhich brings me to the next thing I loved about this film. It breaks it's own mold, the one set by the original. Not only is it a brilliant superhero comedy-action film, but it also has evolved to included drama among it's genres. This movie makes you care about Wade Wilson not as a comic book character come to life, but as a person. Deadpool 2 successfully humanizes is anti-protagonist in an evolution unique unto itself. And that is not even the last OR best thing this movie has added to it's already bursting roster of value.\n\nThe last thing I'll write about here is the one that, in Marvel meta terms, is bar none the most significant thing this movie does;\n\nIt fixes the problem of how does Marvel introduce The X-Men in to it's MCU while also having possibly just introduced (and in no way did many people see this coming) Lady Death. Let that settle for a minute as you imagine what that could mean for part two of Infinity War... and then I'll continue below.\n\nListen, Deadpool 2 broke all expectations I had of it. I wasn't even sure it'd be a good movie after the original's writer left. But instead, and right now, there is a multifaceted movie that has everything a good movie should have in it. \n\nDoes every bit of it with near-perfect execution. Do a few jokes miss their landing? Depends on who's watching. Was the humanization of the titular anti-hero unwarranted and the one comedically unbroken scene of real human drama not earned? Depends on who's watching (in 2018 - before Infinity War 2 - and possibly so many more Phase 4-5 movies!).  Was it disappointing to watch Shatterstar's body brutally destroyed? Nope. Not with who the real X-Force becomes by the end. And that kind of misdirection from a pre-release marketing standpoint is brilliant. As are many things this movie does.\n\nSo please, go throw your money at Deadpool 2. Now.",

The jokes and pop culture references are all aimed for the 21 to 45 crowd and I was surprised at the amount of cross over \"name dropping\" from other comics. With a bigger budget, expect a lot of better action scenes and CGI. Believe it or not, the main story actually has a nice message too. Josh Brolin is great as Cable but I gotta say Zazie Beetz as Domino steals the show here, she was amazing. It goes to show that a strong empowered super woman doesn't always have to be extremely tomboy, a bitch, pessimistic, or have a jaded past. Funny, sarcastic, and nice can still be part of a badass superheroine. Stay for the end credits, they are glorious! But don't stay for the after credits, there is nothing, you've been warned.

Another huge strong point for the movie was the lack of a feeling that scenes were written to set up future movies, everything felt self contained which made me actually want to see some of these characters again!\nCable, Firefist and the big guy are awesome, and task force X hilarious. I liked that it didn't try to go too big with some world ending event at the end, it's become part of the modern superhero movie formula and it's so played out.

            "content": "Deadpool 2 (4 out of 5 stars). Deadpool 2 is back and turns out to live up to the first movie. With plenty of exciting action sequences, a wise cracking script and performance from Ryan Reynolds that delivers with lots of humor. Ryan Reynolds is born to play the character. Plus the humor in the movie does take a lot of jabs to the Marvel characters from The Avengers or making fun of DC for its seriousness. It may not be the best superhero movie with a thin plot or lacking depth with the villain (I will avoid spoilers on the plot). Is it better than the first film? I will say they are equally entertaining. The first movie did not have much depth with the plot either. The plot follows Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) after a downhill spiral on life. He may be given another chance to do a good deed by saving a moody mutant teen Russell (Julian Dennison) who has the powers of firefist. When Cable (Josh Brolin) arrives from the future and his only goal is to kill Russell. Deadpool enlists new recruits to form a team called X Force with one of the members being Domino (Zazie Beetz). I will say the plot felt a little thin when it comes to having a story. Has that Terminator concept with a man coming from the future to rewrite history. Sure, there is a joke thrown in there from that concept. The movie is nonetheless entertaining, funny, and exciting. There are plenty of action sequences that keep the pace moving. The opening montage of Deadpool facing against criminal mobs internationally to an opening credit scene that feels like a James Bond movie with a song played by Celine Dion (which works with the setting and tone of the opening scene). The car chase scene with the huge armored prisoner transport vehicle and Domino and Deadpool facing against Cable was the highlight of the movie. I felt like the climax of the movie was a little bit short. Without giving away spoilers, the turning point of the villain was a bit weak. Also, you get to know a little about Cable and his motives on going after Russell. Josh Brolin was perfect as Cable. It would be difficult to see anyone else playing the character. Morena Baccarin returns. Same with T.J. Miller the wise cracking buddy of Deadpool. Colossus returns as the goody good X-Men character that is trying to recruit Deadpool to doing good. Brianna Hildebrand is back as Negasonic Warhead but with a short role. Zazie Beetz is Domino. And her character is also the highlight of the movie. She did great with the role. I did not like Julian Dennison as Russell. A character that is moody with anger issues and undeveloped. It was difficult to care for the character even when Deadpool and Domino are trying to save him. The movie had plenty of humor. It did not take itself seriously which threw jokes towards Marvel's characters, DC, even the I want to build a snowman from Frozen. The humor was fun and stupid. Overall, Deadpool 2 is a good superhero film. Ryan Reynold's delivered with performance and script. He is the wise cracking character, which also poked fun at himself. The action was exciting and also delivered by a director David Leitch (who did movies like John Wick and Atomic Blonde). Josh Brolin and Zazie Beetz were great and highlights of the movie. The film is a lot of fun with plenty of humor and action. Also, there is two mid credit scenes that is a lot of fun as it pokes fun at the character. I do recommend seeing this film in theatres if you enjoyed the first movie for the action and its raunchy stupid humor.",

            "content": "\"It feels bigger,\" runs the tagline for this potty-mouthed sequel. It's a cheeky double entendre that in fact holds very true; there's a massively increased budget ($110m compared to the first's $58m), an A-list co-star (Josh Brolin) to share the publicity burden, and an extra ten minutes on the runtime. But does bigger mean better? Not quite, but it's pretty bloody close. With extra cash to throw around and a director-swap seeing ex-stunts coordinator David Leitch (Atomic Blonde) take the helm, one thing is for sure: the action set pieces are more ambitious and accomplished. The bar is set high early on, the movie opening with a stylish killing-spree montage sequence boasting both an awesome Kill Bill homage and a sensational single-take bloodbath. From there we get a hard-hitting prison breakout (with Brolin's Cable stealing the show), a bonkers melee aboard a high-speed truck, and a finale featuring some slick close quarters combat; all sprinkled with some cartoonish ultra-violence befitting of a Deadpool outing. Adding lead star Ryan Reynolds to the screenwriting team - presumably to bolster the dialogue with his trademark attitude - the subversive fourth-wall breaking and offensive humour is in full swing once again. It doesn't land with the same did-that-just-happen impact of the original because this time it's expected; but a decrease in shock value doesn't lessen the amusement of witty pop culture references (the MCU features heavily) or blink-and-they'll-vanish celebrity cameos. And of course there's Deadpool himself. The charismatic Reynolds plays the Merc with the Mouth with unbridled smart-arse glee, clearly relishing every zinger and barb he gets to unleash. The supporting cast is a mixed bag though: Brolin and Zazie Beets shine as the badass Cable and the very lucky Domino respectively, but Kiwi jokester Julian Dennison fails to ignite as tormented teen Russell and returning cast members T.J. Miller and Morena Baccarin are under-utilised. A sequel that doubles down on its tongue-in-cheek tone, over-the-top action and savage humour, Deadpool 2 is an uproarious superhero ride that offers fans more of what they love.",

            "content": "\"Deadpool 2\" (R, 1:59) is a superhero action-adventure comedy, which is a sequel to 2016's boundary-shattering \"Deadpool\". This is the 11th of the X-Men films. Although Marvel Comics properties, neither the X-Men or Deadpool films are considered part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This one was written by returning scribes Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, but this time with help from franchise star Ryan Reynolds. Version 2.0 has a different director, David Leitch (\"Atomic Blonde\", \"John Wick\"), after original director Tim Miller left the project due to \"mutual creative differences\" with Reynolds.\n\nMuch like the original, the sequel has plenty of sarcasm, inuendo, social political satire, meta humor, 4th wall breaking... and bloody violence. Fan favorite characters are back too! The titular \"merch with the mouth\" remains devoted to his one true love, Vanessa (Morena Baccarin), is still friends with his former roommate, Blind Al (Leslie Uggams), and continues to receive support from his best friend, Weasel (T.J. Miller), and favorite cab driver, Dopinder (Karan Soni), while still being frenemies with X-\"Men\" Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand). D2, however, has more heart, as Mr. Pool's capacity for love and self-sacrifice extend beyond his relationship with Vanessa and he begins playing nice with others... kind of. Well, some early narration does refer to this as \"a family movie\", so...\n\nAfter a shocking tragedy early in the film (so early that the opening credits get all meta with it), Wade Wilson / Deadpool is acting darker than usual. Colossus and NTW take Wade to the X-Mansion and try to break him out of his funk by getting him involved in X-Men business. When they take him to a mutant rehab facility to try talking down an overweight mutant teen named Russell (Julian Dennison) who is threatening violence against the facility's manager (Eddie Marsan), the way Wade handles the situation drives a fresh wedge between him and the X-Men. Wade decides that Russell needs his protection (and that Wade himself needs to do some protecting), so he forms a paramilitary mutant group that he calls X-Force. This puts him, and new recruits like Domino (Zazie Beetz), Zeitgeist (Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd) and Bedlam (Terry Crews), up against a huge mutant called Juggernaut and a another known as Cable (Josh Brolin) who has come from the future for the sole purpose of killing Russell. Yeah, there's a lot going on here.\n\n\"Deadpool 2\" would be a blockbuster if it were the first in the series, but can't quite match the original. Well how could it? 2016's \"Deadpool\" was a shock to the system, a real game changer. This one keeps in place the attitude and the actors which made the first one so popular and expands the title character's world to give us more to look at, but the sequel isn't as fresh and effortlessly entertaining as the original. D2 may be a little bit less slick than its predecessor, but in and of itself, it's still a damn good time. \"A-\"",

            "content": "There is a scene in the opening moments of Deadpool 2 that immediately bears weight and feels significant to the narrative arch of our anti-hero Deadpool. It was in that moment I also realized I had very little recollection of the story from the first film. My memory was more of what Deadpool was, rather than who surrounds him in his universe. \nInitially, it doesn't seem like the supporting characters should really matter that much in a film with such a colorful title star, but Deadpool 2 and Ryan Reynolds thrive in the spaces surrounding the variety of personas in the film.\n\nPicture Deadpool taking on a challenge course. Each obstacle in the course requires a unique approach and is interacted with differently than the others. This is easier said than done in movies, but the range Reynolds shows in how his character connects with his wife Vanessa, Weasel the bartender, his eager friend Dopinder, and Russell the troubled youth is impressive. Perhaps it's my memory of what Deadpool was - a raunchy, sarcastic, silly hero - I was surprised when a range was shown that offered more to the character and built something that mattered. \n\nThere are many lines throughout the film that want to give us the impression this movie doesn't want to be taken seriously. This includes sections where Reynolds breaks the third wall, calling out the writers for being lazy, or saying a CGI fight is upcoming. It's almost like the talented kid in high school, who might be surprisingly good at a niche, unpopular activity and then wants to downplay their own talent when others discover what they are capable of.\n \nDeadpool 2 offers a memorable experience that is more than just reintroducing a wacky character, it's a journey that feels like it matters and is very worthy of your time.",

There's a kid actor in this who I was convinced had to be related to someone or have won a contest because the acting is that bad and one-note. Nope. He's got multiple film credits somehow. The plot really needed to be streamlined because it's not clear what the actual plot is until halfway through the film. And with all that waiting, it's nothing that interesting once you get to it. It felt more like an episode of Family Guy than anything, relying on references rather than actual jokes. It's not the worst film in the world.

Brolin does a good job as the straight man in Deadpool's world of insanity and kicking butt. However, it's Zazie Beets who really steals the show as Domino. She does a great job as the sassy, sarcastic counterpart to Deadpool and her luck powers work for some really creative fight scenes. No spoilers, but one X-Men character who has never gotten his or her due finally gets his/her cinematic moment to shine.\n\nNow, why do I think the first one is better if this one is funnier? Deadpool 1 was a lot more solid plot-wise. Deadpool 2 is darker and more anarchist than the first. At times, the more serious scenes feel like they conflict with the more humorous ones. I do appreciate the need for an emotional backbone to the film, things could've been smoother. Anyway, if you liked the first you should still really like this.",

I could not for the life of me find any flaws. In my humble opinion, it has surpassed Avengers & all it's progeny as THE greatest superhero film of the modern age!!!! But it's still not a kid's film. No nudity this time, but still way too much violence & swearing for the young'uns. Ah heck with it! Bring'em anyway! This film is too good to pass up!!!\n\nThe cast hasn't lost a step. Ryan Reynolds is going to be DeadPool for the next hundred years at least! He blends comedy & tragedy in a way that would make the ancient Greeks bow down in praise. And he's not so stuck up that he won't self depreciate. The rest of the original cast each have their moments, & none of them are wasted or forgotten. Now let's get into the new characters. Domino. Let's face it, most of us just know her as boobs fer lookin' at, but in the movie, she could hold her own in a scene, she helped the story move, & her power, while subtle, was always visible. I found her to be kind've a modern Foxy Brown, & I hope to see her in many future installments. Cable. Not quite as over the top as the cartoon I remember, but still well played, he was like this universe's Rambo, he emoted without telegraphing, you could feel his pain & see where he was comin' from. The not-villain was soooo relatable! So many of us could see ourselves going to that dark place! The true villains were cookie cutter, & it was satisfying to see their end. The rest of the cast didn't have the spotlight long, but they did leave a nice impression, including a few surprises.\n\nThe effects were golden! Practical stunts, CGI that wasn't afraid to be itself, what more can I say?\n\nThe music was just the right mix(tape) of '90s awesome. 'Nuff said.\n\nOverall, I laughed, I cried, I wanted both sides to win in some way, & they did. It was an Oscar worthy roller coaster, it was a family film in every sense of the word, & DEADPOOL 2 IS....5 stars outta 5!",

Ryan Reynolds is brilliant once again and truly embodies the Deadpool character. The movie enhances some of the character roles from the first film, (ex. Dopinder) and also does a great job focusing on the main hero instead of relying heavily on the primary villain. Deadpool is easy to root for and simply an amazing to follow.

One particular background shot in the X-Men mansion was perfectly meta and I'm actually glad the film kept it to a cameo.  No flat spots to speak of and did a great job at balancing the pathos and the humour.  Better than Infinity War.

Avenger: Infinity War was one of those.  Even though I never went and saw any previous Avengers movies in the movie theater, that was like the culmination of it all and something people had been talking about for awhile.  I also saw the prequel to this in the theater so, when it came time to decide, I figured I might as well see the second one too.  In the end the movie was okay, about as good as the first and maybe better, because it included Cable and Wolverine and a few other X-Men.    \n\nStrangely enough, the two movies I watched in theaters before this were Super Troopers 2 and Avengers: Infinity War and this was kind of a mash-up of those two.  Maybe they should have called it The Super Troopers of Infinity War and gotten rid of the guy in the red mask, then it might be an 8 of 10, or even a 9.   \n\n7 of 10",

He's known for crafting amazing action scenes and Deadpool 2 is filled with them; this movie is a total blast to watch regarding the action.\n\nThere is a white-knuckle chase scene in this film that rivals the highway chase that started the first film, and as per usual with the Deadpool character this movie is very, very funny. Lots of jokes, not all of them land as usual with a comedy but most of them do because this character is so endearing despite being such a loudmouth.\n\nThis truly is the year of Josh Brolin he's one of the best parts of the film, newcomers Julian Dennison and Zazie Beetz are great, as are most of the returning cast. Ryan Reynolds continues to show that the role of Deadpool was made for him, by also bring Deadpool down to earth a little bit and explores more of the character that is Wade Wilson and less of Deadpool and it makes him a more compelling character with a deeper side to him.\n\nDeadpool 2 is a weird movie. On the one hand, it's the film you expect it to be: raunchy jokes flying at you non-stop paired with gory violence. That's the character, that's the brand, and that's why the first movie was a success. But on the other hand, buried beneath all the F-bombs and superhero references is a real story about Deadpool. He's learning to fight for someone other than himself and opening up his heart. It's the kind of storytelling that the rest of the movie would seem all-too-eager to mock. This gives Deadpool 2 a case of tonal whiplash where you're laughing hysterically at the devil-may-care jokes only to have you pump the brakes and care about Deadpool's emotional arc. And yet at the end, Deadpool 2 is similar to its predecessor in that you'll have a blast while watching it.",

If you enjoyed the first one, you'll like what they're doing here, even though there are a few missteps in the dialogue, and the CGI isn't very inspired.  The opening is very James Bond-esque and I love they had Celine Dion singing it.  \nI loved Domino, but was very worried about the character before viewing the movie.  I was not, however, sold on Peter.  He sucks, and is irredeemable, in my opinion.  The other characters seem fine, and there's a little cameo by Brad Pitt, as well as Matt Damon, even though you won't recognize him.  The worst part of this movie was either Colossus, and his 'That's how we do it in mother Russia\" line, or Deadpool when he pops up at a funeral in the beginning, because that was terrible.\nThe child actor playing Fire Fist was good, and you get to see him get punched in the face a few times for good measure. \nAction was pretty consistent, and enjoyable to watch with some pretty intense gore at times, but more than the situation called for.  \n\nOverall, just leave the kids at home (my first showing of this had two small children in the theater making quite a bit of noise near the beginning, shame on their parents)  and be ready to have some fun watching people get set of fire and chopped up.",

Ryan Reynolds continues to surprise. Overall the movie was fun and surprising, with lots of moments that made me laugh. Although some of the jokes felt old, or re-used, they still managed to really make me smile. Josh Brolin as Cable was one of the best things about that movie and managed to possibly up his performance as Thanos. Domino was a legend of a character and held the movie together, she not only is a strong female character but also the strongest character in the movie. The character I most looked forward to coming back on screen was domino. I can't wait to see he continue to get used and maybe spin off into a solo movie (that she could 100% pull off) Overall Deadpool 2 is pure fun, with some flaws, but overall a very strong movie. \n8.7/10",

If you didn't like DP, don't bother as it is more of the same. The movie was able to get going much more quickly as we didn't need to meet Deadpool. The attempt to wring emotion was a bit contrived both with the love interest and the new \"adopted\" child. This is the only area where the original was superior. \n\nIn all other respects DP2 is amazing. The action sequences are more \"realistic\" at times, the new characters Domino and Cable are excellent. I don't want to malign Brolin's excellent job as Cable but Zazie Beetz as Domino was amazing. The performance was aided by some excellent cinematography showing how her luck power works. The discussion of whether luck is a power was a nice touch.\n\nThe humor was there, the fourth wall destruction was there, the raunchiness was there. A nice addition to the mansion based team of Colossus and Negasonic was Yukio, a take on the bubbly asian trope but enjoyable nonetheless. The only reason for the missing half star is the movie, in my opinion took the easy way out at the end. There was some seriousness to the film and then it just kind of wimped out. IMO making the hard choice would have been a better movie.\n\nPS Stick around for the mid credit scene. Funniest one ever made.",

Just as the first installment, there isn't much to look forward to on the plotline (which is predictable) but the journey it takes; even though it derails a lot, is intriguing and amusing at the same time. The major conundrum of the feature would be the lack of connection with the audience (even though the protagonist is literally filling in the audience with the details) as the stakes and emotions projected in here are shallow and doesn't go as anticipated. The songs are upbeat but the technical aspects could have been a lot better like the background score, vfx and editing. David Leitch has done a decent work on directing and pulling off the mayhem that this feature is, but unfortunately wasn't supported by the cinematography or the choreography which is essential in such features. The performance isn't upto the mark by Ryan Reynolds (but then Deadpool is quite complex to play) and neither is supported to that extent by Josh Brolin which comes off a bit disappointing. Deadpool 2 is an overstretched feature that numbs the emotions as it ages on screen let along draw it out and the soul reason would be due to the wafer thin script that never bothers to even justify the actions occurring or even make a definite point out of it. Having said that, if considered as just a parody of another installment of its predecessor, it works just fine.",

In fact, what prevents it from being the exercise in total irreverence of the expected Deadpool is the attempt to inject an unironic lesson of heroism for the Merc with a Mouth. The seriousness of this plotline (which is basically \"Looper\") is just tonally different to be a bit of a downer.\n\nOf the extensive supporting cast, the standouts are (besides Reynolds) Julian Dennison as Russell and especially Zazie Beets as Domino.

            "content": "From a purely objective point of view 'Deadpool 2' was a great film if you are interested in the odd genre it has created for itself. The franchise has become synonymous for its over the top language, violence and pointed sexual innuendos and this particular sequel to 20th Century Fox's cult hit, is no exception. If it is your desire to see a superhero film that makes you cheer for the hero and clap when the bad guy gets what he has coming to him, then I am afraid that this is not the film for you. If this is a film that you want to take your children to, may I suggest you reconsider, because this film and its predecessor are not for the eyes and ears of the innocent. \nAs of right now, 'Deadpool 2' is rocking an 84% on rottentomatoes.com, but I expect that number to fluctuate as more movie critics submit their personal opinions over this film. I personally believe the current critic score for this film is spot on because of this film's genre. 'Deadpool 2' is a comedy before it is anything else, and as comedies go, this film has a ton of jokes that hit and quite a few that missed. At times the quick little quips were funnier than the long running jokes that appeared with greater frequency as the film progressed, something that Deadpool himself attributed to lazy writing, along with certain plot points. If your intention was to see a film about a super hero, I say again, this is the wrong film for you. \nWith a runtime of nearly two hours this film is not just vulgar joke after vulgar joke. There are quite a few action sequences in this film that really paid off visually. The chase scene in particular was one of the best scenes in the film for me because it combined together all the elements of what made the original 'Deadpool' such a great film. There were however bad action sequences, which I believe the writers intentionally made bad because Deadpool himself stops the film to talk to the audience about how bad they are going to be, to which I can understand to a certain point. At the same time though, it did start to get a little repetitive and lost a ton of the comedic value and towards the end, it was like beating a dead horse--kinda pointless.\nAside from the comedy and action, which were both pretty decent in their own rights, you have a story which is the weakest point in this film and why I saved it for last. I don't want to spoil anything about the story for this film, so I will just say that it seemed rather convoluted because it had too many parts to it. Couple that with some questionable acting from some of the supporting characters in this film and leaves the audience with little to be desired. Some would argue that the story for films such as these are supposed to take a back seat because the gore, language, action and comedy sequences are what makes films like 'Deadpool' and 'Deadpool 2' so great, but I believe this film would be far more successful if the story had been cleaned up and was given more focus.\nAll in all, 'Deadpool 2' was a pretty decent movie and I recommend anyone who saw the first one and liked it to give the sequel a try. I will say again, and for the last time, this is not a child friendly movie, something to consider if you may be on the fence about taking you kids to see this film with you. In the theater I was in I saw about six children, all of which looked as if they were 6 years old or younger so, for the last time, do NOT take your kids to see this movie.",

I find it an indictment on professional reviewers that as of this moment they have given a mere 84% to this movie. The only explanation I can fathom is that they are incapable of appreciating the nuances of this film.\nEvery 15 seconds there is a hilarious joke yet simultaneously a very deep and poly dimensional story is being told in great detail.\nI sincerely hope that this film becomes one of the classics studied by students for decades to come. Let them appreciate Akira Kurosawa alongside this masterpiece. To those who don't appreciate this incredible piece of cinematic mastery I can only assume that you are sadly unable to appreciate brilliance and should return immediately to your previous profession of reviewing chewable suppositories.",

As far as the main story was concerned I could take it or leave it.  There is nothing that particularly stands out about it.  Also, while there are some great pop culture references in the film, I think there are a few that have been used a little too much.  The most overused one is the \"Say Anything\" reference.  However the parachute jump scene was so brilliant and so rip roaring hysterical that it makes the whole movie worth seeing.  I was laughing so hard I almost fell out of my seat.  My sides hurt for the rest of the movie from laughing so hard at that scene.  One last thing, there is a scene during the credits that ends with Wade/Deadpool saying \"You're welcome Canada!\".  You can leave after that scene.  There is no post credit sequence.",

There's a nice blink and you'll miss it came that I enjoyed. Other than that, definitely stick around for the two post-credit scenes, it's a nice little cherry on top of the cake. Julian Dennison (the kid from Hunt for the Wilderpeople) basically plays the same character as in the aforementioned movie and he fucking nails it again (although Taika Waititi's humour and script are FAR superior). \n\nIn conclusion, if you've got nothing better to do then grab a couple friends (if you have some, I saw it alone, it's okay to see movies alone especially if you order a beer) and head down to any old theatre (really don't need fancy Dolby ATMOS sound or giant screens for this one) to kill some time and hide away from the heat. \n\nIt's not bad but it's also not great or hilarious.",

It is the eleventh installment in the X-Men film series and a sequel to the 2016 film Deadpool. The film is directed by David Leitch from a script by Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick, and Ryan Reynolds, with Reynolds starring in the title role alongside Josh Brolin, Morena Baccarin, Julian Dennison, Zazie Beetz, T.J. Miller, Brianna Hildebrand, and Jack Kesy. In the film, Deadpool forms the team X-Force to protect a young mutant from Cable. ( Wikipedia)\nThis film takes the humor and violence of the first film and improves on them. The jokes in this film were done in what felt like a smarter way and hit with the same outburst of laughter throughout the whole theater which made it even better. There is a lot more action in this film and it doesn't mess with the feel of the film at all. The director threw in a lot of little Easter eggs in this film just like the first film had and eagle eye Deadpool/Marvel Fans will love every single one of them. The raunchiness in this film is turn down quite a bit from the first film and I would feel comfortable watching this film with my mother but it is still not for kids. \nThis film is a must see, if you saw the first Deadpool and loved it then you will love this film. I was laughing out loud and enjoying every minute of the film which doesn't happen often at the theaters with me. I recommend seeing this in the theaters such as your local Goodrich Theaters. You will most likely see this more than once especially to catch all of the jokes that are thrown in.\nFor anyone who has seen this movie let me know your thoughts in the comments below but please remember no spoilers.",

I enjoyed this one quite a bit. I don't think it's as good as the first film, but it's so close! The movie does feature better action sequences in this film and the comedy is full throttle at times here. The movie works so well because Ryan Reynolds just embodies the character of Deadpool. The wise cracking and over the top quips just come so smoothly. Brolin is great as Cable, but I wish we had just a bit more on him. It's hard to explain without ruining the movie, but he's definitely got the cool factor going on for him. Domino is great in the scenes she's in, but ultimately I felt like she was underused. Colossus has a better role in this film, but Negasonic definitely takes a step back which I didn't like because she genuinely seems to be a cool character. The movie has a better plot this time around I will say and it flows pretty well. The movie is great overall still and even though it still falls short in a few categories (CG at times is atrocious) I had a fun time watching this.

Look I think  I'm at apoint where I now know going into a deadpool movie that its not gonna be great .

The script, by Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick and Ryan Reynolds, is loaded with winky, fourth-wall-piercing eruptions of meta, the kind of humor that can make even the slow-witted and literal-minded feel devilishly clever. Works for me, I guess. But this sequel to the R-rated, X-Men-adjacent surprise blockbuster of 2016 works maybe a little too hard in the service of a dubious cause. \u201cDeadpool 2,\u201d cracking wise at the expense of nearly every intellectual property in the DC and Marvel universes \u2014 and occasionally drawing metaphorical blood to go along with the abundant onscreen gore \u2014 uses its self-aware irreverence to perform the kind of brand extension and franchise building it pretends to lampoon. Grief and despair drive Wade first to seek revenge and then to try to prevent two other acts of vengeance from taking place. The first 30-40 minuets of the movie weren\u2019t that entertaining to me, there were a few jokes that made me laugh, but for me the movie got going once Josh Brolin\u2019s Cable showed up and kick some ass. And Zazie Beetz is great as Domino. And there are some fantastic cameos, that definitely draw a laugh and a \u201cwait I know who that is\u201d. For me \u201cDeadpool 2\u201d is a good-enough sequel to the original, but it is definitely not better than the first one. I just wish we could of actually seen X-Force.",

I appreciated Deadpool for its humour and its free expression. It wasn't afraid to show decapitations or make jokes at the expense of people with disabilities. Believe it or not, this is a good thing if we want true equality. We're all equally as ridiculous in Deadpool's eyes. I enjoyed Deadpool 2 even more than its predecessor. It was just as irreverent, but I laughed more and I felt the feels even more. Yes, there are some moments where we just 'have to go along' with what we're seeing on the movie screen, but Deadpool [the movie] is an entity so meta, that I feel like it knows that it has to tread water at times just to allow the more fantastic and fantastical moments shine brighter.

Thankfully, he has a great gift for on-screen chemistry as well.  \nMuch like I loved \"Guardians 2\" more than \"Guardians of the Galaxy\", \"Deadpool 2\" displays more heart than \"Deadpool\" despite its iconoclastic banter and irreverence.  It's Old School:  Hero uses his or her powers for good, for family.  Hero fights for love.  To the point:  Deadpool 2 is awesome.",

The merc with a mouth returns in a film that is funnier, sadder, more action packed, more violent, more character driven and contains even more references to the X-men world, than the first installment. Wade and Vanessa are about to move their relationship forward but a series of unfortunate events leads Wade to prison, were he has to protect a mutant kid from a time travelling soldier that wants to kill him. To succeed in his mission, Wade creates a group of supers, called the X-force. Reynolds manages to top his performance from the first film, adding a lot more depth to Wade, but also making him even more funny and badass. From the new cast of characters, Zazie Beetz is lovely as Domino and Josh Brolin, following his groundbreaking performance as Thanos in another Marvel movie, gives life to the complex Cable in the best way possible. The action is much bigger and better than the first film, with an increased budget that director David Leitch makes a perfect use of. As nearly perfect as the first film was, this sequel somehow manages to improve on it on almost every level. It might not make the best use out of some of its supporting characters, but that's not a major issue. The film has a very smart and unusual - for this genre, at least - perception of evil, that was quite surprising. \"Deadpool 2\" is a family film that isn't for families, which will make you excited for \"X-force\", \"Brown Panther\" and any other film in the franchise that's about to come.",

            "content": "Deadpool 2 manages to improve upon its predecessor whilst maintaining the same level of laughs, references, fourth-wall breaking, and action that made the first movie such a breath of fresh air. \nIt has been said many times, but I'll say it again anyway, Ryan Reynolds was born to play Deadpool/Wade Wilson; he just seems to get the character. In the role, Reynolds is hilarious and doesn't have a care in the world. He goes back and forth between talking to the audience and the characters in the film with ease. You can have no shame when playing the role of Deadpool and Reynolds completely understands this. He shows the necessary level of energy every step of the way and never lets up on the gas. Similar to Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, Reynolds fits Deadpool like a glove. Part 2 of Josh Brolin's amazing summer box office run (Pt. 1 being Thanos in Infinity War) picks up with the role of Cable, who is sort of, but not really, the villain. Cable is a big, cyborg mercenary dude who is on a mission that conflicts with Wilson's epiphany-lead undertaking; this leads to a couple exciting action sequences between the two. Brolin doesn't show much humanity at first, but slowly reveals it as the film progresses. Cable is a fun character to watch fight and Brolin successfully establishes his character as the tough-as-nails, detached emotion variety, but more could have been done with the character. A surprising stand-out, Zazie Beetz who plays Domino, made quite the first impression and looks to be a strong addition to the already strong collection of supporting characters. \nPerhaps the biggest flaw of the first Deadpool was its lack of story. It showed Deadpool's origin followed by the pursuit of the man who made him look like an \"avocado had sex with an older, more disgusting avocado.\" Deadpool 2 succeeds in finding a story to go with everything that made the first movie great. In the sequel, Deadpool has to protect Russell, a kid mutant who is being hunted by Cable, and learn things along the way. Themes of love, family, purpose, abuse, friendship, and choice run throughout the movie; the movie felt less like a series of gags building to a climax, and more like a well-rounded story. \nThe comedic nature of the Deadpool films are what make them special, and Deadpool 2 is easily the funniest movie I have seen so far this year. The jokes are always present and rarely miss. I would say Deadpool 2 is as funny as the first movie. The action is explosive and uncompromisingly brutal; it also is as violent as the first movie. Once again, the soundtrack choices are interesting as songs are played over scenes you'd never think they'd be used for, lending to the unserious tone. Most remarkably, Deadpool 2 does not end up like many other sequels to smash-hits where the original is made out of a unique formula and succeeds due to its freshness, but when the sequel comes around, the film feels slightly more forced and less fresh. Deadpool 2 stays away from this, improving upon the original even if just slightly. It did not feel forced in the least and its antithesis to other superhero films is appreciated. My only critiques of the film are minor, the end gag dragged on a little too long, the kid was a little annoying at times, and many of the references are likely to be lost in time due to their contemporary nature. \nDeadpool 2 is a film you should see today and is something rarely seen in sequels, an improvement on the original.",

Zazie Beetz really surprised me as Domino, she did a very good job portraying that iconic Character.\n\nAnd a extra point for Fans of the X-Men Universe was the cameo by some of the X-Men, such as Professor X, Cyclops and Quicksilver, as well as a cameo from Brad Pitt.\n\nI also enjoyed the music quite well and as a summary you could say the Easter eggs and jokes related to the X-Men and MCU movies is what makes the movie so good.

I understand he is a kid and not in the movie a ton but there were times were his lines and jokes just didnt fit. I felt like adding *SPOILER* juggernaut was a pretty cool idea but it could have been executed better towards the end. A movie with such a big budget made the Juggernaut fight scene look 5 years old. The jokes in this movie hit about 50% of the time but that's really good considering theres at least 100 small jokes in this movie.

            "content": "Deadpool 2 follows deadpool's mission to protect a mutant boy Russell a.k.a Firefist (Julian Dennison) from the time travelling mercenary Cable (Josh Brolin).\nThis movie does everything the original did but takes it up a notch. There's more comedy, more action and more characters than before. Ryan Reynolds is once again excellent as the merc with a mouth. Deadpool is not just about quips and meta jokes all the time but there are even some emotional moments that I really liked.\nI loved Cable in this film and Josh Brolin was a great choice for the role. Also just weeks ago Brolin amazed us with his performance as Thanos which is made fun of as we saw in the trailers. One big thing about Deadpool 2 was The X-Force. The trailers almost exclusively promoted the X-Force although after watching the movie I'm in a bit of a pickle. Without spoiling anything I think the direction that they took the X-Force was outrageous and hilarious but also a bit disappointing.\nApart from Deadpool and Cable, other notable characters were Domino (Zazie Beetz), Firefist, Dopinder and this one character I can't spoil. Also Colossus gets a lot to do and his interactions with deadpool are some of the highlights of the film. I quite like Colossus but the previous X-Men films always kept him in the background which made me very happy when I saw the original deadpool and he is just as fantastic in deadpool 2. That leaves us with the rest of the cast including characters like negasonic teenage warhead (Brianna Hilderbrand), Blind Al(Leslie Uggams), Weasel etc. were entertaining but don't really get much to do. \nVeteran stuntman David Leitch who directed this films has previously worked on John Wick and Atomic Blonde, both films with some exceptional fight sequences. So it was obvious that Deadpool was gonna have great fight scenes and it does deliver but doesn't surpass Leitch's previous work. The music is pretty good and it really works well with the tone of the movie. \nLastly my one problem with the movie which doesn't really bother me that much but still worth mentioning is this one decision that cable makes at the end that I'm not going to spoil but those who have seen the film will probably know what I'm referring to. \nDeadpool 2 although at times may feel more of the same and has a few other minor problems is an extremely entertaining and hilarious film filled with cameos, easter eggs, references and a lot of graphic violence. I had a blast watching Deadpool 2 and I do like it better than the first one.",

The pacing is impeccable. The script also gave all the characters a fair share of screen time and importance that will make you thoroughly invested in them, specially the old characters.\n\nIn contrast to the original, the villains are very compelling and potent; because their motives are way more plausible, but most importantly more clear.\n\nDeadpool 2 is also more heavier in meta jokes, and that's where \"bigger\" doesn't necessarily mean \"better\". Honestly, this movie has more creative and funnier jokes that you'd never believe they could exist, but the element of shock and awe can't be put back into its bottle. The result is a smarter, and quite funny, jokes that don't work as well as the original's.\n\nThe action is very good, and that's very frustrating! David Leitch is one of the best action film directors who work today, because he make design action sequences and stunt work that can't be forgotten; some of John Wick and Atomic Blonde's action sequences still stick in my mind. However in this film, Leitch made enjoyable action sequences, but totally forgettable.\n\nWhat surprised me in this movie is that it has a strong emotional impact that is rare to be in a superhero movie. Some scenes are really touching and emotionally devastating.\n\nAll in all, I think Deadpool 2 is a slight improvement upon its predecessor, but it proves again that Ryan Reynolds as Wade WIlson/Deadpool is one of the best superhero casting choices ever along with Hugh Jackman as Logan/Wolverine, and Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Also, this mid-credits scene is simply the best and coolest mid-credits scene ever put to film!\n\n(8.5/10)",

It was cool for Josh Brolin to portray as Cable but his character lack on what is really being cable, so he was just there. X-Force became a joke. Which was really a parody to the usual and yet terrible team ups we've witnessed over the years. If you think the jokes are far too much than you didn't look at memes enough to even be okay with the stuff that's happened in this movie. If you didn't then it may be funny to you anyways. Overall, some of the parts were reused and rehashed from the first one and just lazy writing for the sequel. Don't get me wrong, I love the Marvel character Deadpool but I feel like this one just didn't live up to its incredible and distasteful amount of ads telling us that it's the most hype movie ever. This is the kind of problem that Fox does with their superhero movies. no in-depth progression and character development is little to no existence. I'd still watch this movie again since there were a lot of scenes that I enjoyed so much like looking at the same f***cking memes every day. Especially the s***tposts and reposts. It's great. Oh and I can't stand the forced romance. Plus it was dragging on so much that it sucked ***.",

But, they weren\u2019t. They were a lot more hilarious than the first film. Ryan Reynolds brought us a slight dramatic and more charming as Wade Wilson/Deadpool. Bringing us the great team X-Force to the mix was absolutely HILARIOUS. Zazie Beetz shines as Neena Thurman/Domino because of her charm of LUCK. Josh Brolin was great as another comic book character after Marvel\u2019s \u2018Avengers: Infinity War\u2019. After Tim Miller\u2019s departure on directing this film, I didn\u2019t know how David Leitch\u2019s style would change this movie, but still remains as a \u2018Deadpool\u2019 movie. The film\u2019s soundtrack had great song choices; Tyler Bates\u2019 score is also great, but a few tracks with the choir had me chuckling a bit. This film is a lot more violent and gore than its predecessor, but not as violent as \u2018Logan\u2019. There were so many cultural references including the Marvel Cinematic Universe, DC Comics, the studio, and of course, the previous X-Men Cinematic Universe films. 8.3/10.",

I also loved the cameo by the X-Men and that they returned Juggernaut (in a good way).

The ability was now given to do Deadpool without unnecessary budget constraints. Would the change of directors matter? Short answer, no. Long answer noooooooooooooooooooo. David Leitch steps in and earns his opening sequence credit mention (you'll see), and throws us a Deadpool that is another epic romp of hilarity and action.\n\nAs before, the soundtrack is a great co-star to the movie, giving lift to the moments where Ryan Reynolds' DP is at his funniest or his deepest. And DP does have to find some depth within himself as he moves through the film in order to carry it forward.\n\n\nSome observations:\n\nEvery scene with Blind Al is brilliant. The interactions between her and Deadpool are hilarious, and there's a scene further on with the two of them that may leave you in need of a paper bag from all the hyperventilating you'll be doing on account of laughing so hard.\n\nJosh Brolin gets Cable down perfectly, and this guy does not get nearly enough credit for his skill as an actor. Not everyone could make Thanos likable and Cable awesome within the same month, but he has done it.\n\nZazie Beetz is your show-stealer. She makes a great Domino, and her rapport with Reynolds is obvious.\n\nPeter! X-Force!\n\n\nThere's a lot of great stuff happening here, and this is the perfect Deadpool sequel.

This is way way better than the original film, it had everything I wanted from deadpool even though the family theme was so 2017. Aka Lego Batman and fast and furious makes this movie, both 2017 movies. This movie gave me a more emotional deadpool, a family man after losing a beloved person in his life. Now let's talk about the real star in this movie, none other than the person who plays domino, zazie betez or something like that. Domino is wonderful in this movie but I wanted a little bit more, she can kick some serious stuff and everything about her character is phenomenal. Every scene she's in ,she in my opinion steals the show. Next up Peter, man, they killed Peter except psych he comes back in the post credits but you know who doesn't come back, everybody on x force except dead pool, domino, and you guessed it now Peter. Everybody died just like infinity war. Thanos himself aka cable was buff and dark. I can't wait to see what's next but before I sign off I gotta talk about what I hated about this film. No stan flipping lee and barely any xmen. Just the one little cameo. Disney or universal, whoever buys fox needs to make an xmen deadpool movie.",

The movie is just such a blast to experience and all of the characters, new or old, are super entertaining. Despite having a different director, the movie still has the same look and feel as the first while simultaneously telling a whole new story. Ryan Reynolds is lovable as the title role and Josh Brolin's Cable is a nice entry for the franchise and a fairly complex and interesting villain. Fans of the first movie will adore this movie. I truly cannot think of a moment in this movie where I wasn't either laughing out loud consistently or just savoring the sensational action scenes.",

            "content": "Remember California Adventure's former musical spectacular \"Aladdin\", and how the Genie actor performed freely with humorous timely jokes? Well he's a spirit animal, or a prior example, behind the Deadpool character in relation to the superhero genre since 2016 from poking fun at \"Batman v Superman\" to co-star Josh Brolin's other Marvel character in the sequel's self-parodic humor. Knowing it was during the post-production phase when James Cameron remarked about the superhero fatigue, I couldn't help but ponder if the film actually went with that fatigue. Never a superhero film ever felt tiresome enough to make your eye lids heavy for a couple of minutes, resulting in losing track of the journey before the predictable destination in one little middle portion.\n\n\"Deadpool 2\" follows the regular ingredient of a sequel in adding another weight of emotional attachments and obstacles onto the character, who by the way must deal with loss and the meaning of family including what it takes to be part of a team. The official, more serious given synopsis, by note, is Wade Wilson, aka Deadpool, decides to put together his own team of similar-natured mutants to protect a young mutant from being hunted by the angered time-traveling cyborg Cable. But that's only telling less than half of the direction since the character himself is truly a wild card of the Marvel brand.\n\nWell, the superhero comedy is surprisingly less inappropriate while it still is along with clever, parodic humor when subtle, but it's actually tiresome and occasionally annoying to make it solidly decent at a surprising low rating since the \"Fantastic Four\" reboot (*insert Deadpool gasping*) - although still offers more entertainment value at a B level. As a responsive consideration, additionally referring back to the wild card remark, this is probably the most unique of the genre's modern turn by being a self-parody that still causes groans like any feature-length parodies but the amount of laughs overall, either to the parodic jokes or not, unbalanced the scale to its favor. Because of that style, it's one of two factors that departs from the \"X-Men\" franchise's thematic taste that even the predecessor possesses, but it's understandable if Deadpool wants to be his own franchise by distancing from the parenthood.\n\nAdjacent to its relation to the overall franchise, what's also a departure is adding another element to the grown narrative through Josh Brolin's character Cable, who literally shifted the franchise's time-space continuum with a recognizable connection of an experienced, still-superior narrative. Ryan Reynolds may have had the spotlight from before and was given an enlarged role to the film, both creatively behind and in front of the camera, with a pleasantly-given stakeholding human drama and still fun as ever with comedic energy, as the the film's main soul, it was Brolin who again stole the spotlight from the titular character - singular this time - by introducing a more freshly compelling character who hasn't been introduced cinematically. Another scene-stealer who stole the spotlight ahead of Reynolds is Zazie Beetz as the lucky mercenary Domino with a charismatic performance that's fresher than Reynolds'.\n\nBehind the keyword \"fresh\", the meaning is referring to the film's dimmed freshness from its more preferable predecessor. The sequel stumbled through the parody genre, in an occasionally over-constipated attempt of being funnier but failed to instead become annoying, and the aforementioned departure in tonal narrative differences. The main aspects that were relied on as persuaded main attractions through the generic taste of action and energetic comedy by Reynolds' charm, and the former of the three increased surrounding the cause-and-effect mayhem from Cable is proof of the original freshness. The rest worked with some struggling to only find decreased acceptance. This isn't because of change of direction from Tim Miller to David Leitch (\"Atomic Blonde\"), it's a plain aura and notion that sequels doesn't meet up to the original. Speaking of direction, complimenting Leitch's direction is rather difficult when there's a sense of convolution on the overall craftsmanship between his or Reynolds's expanded creativity that is more under cynicism. (Reynolds probably proud of himself to have this film to be luckily seen the second time to find this out another day).\n\nAfter experiencing the sort-of overhyped \"Deadpool 2\" that was funnier through the marketing campaign that promised to be as funny as the first coming, the character has lost a viewer into unsure skepticism towards the likelihood of seeing another Deadpool-centered film in the theaters, being a definite maybe for a fitting price of a free or discounted ticket instead of a full-priced ticket. It may be a resulted worthwhile addition with the expected qualities that made the original entertaining in a slight decrease of presentation, but it also strays and bores away from the expectations.

Josh Brolin's physical performance is badass too (its definitely the year of Brolin with Thanos and Cable \n\nZazie Beetz as Domino is perfect I love her on Atlanta andi love her in this movie, she's a badass with her powers and she has good back and forth with Deadpool\n\nDavid Lietch's Direction is what I was worried about with Story, but he definitely proves that he should stay and the one thing he does do that improves from first film is a the action, the action is phenomenal. \n\nNegasonic Teenage Warhead, Vanessa and Colossus are all good.\n\nIts more Meta than the first film\n\nThe X-Force Team Up Sequence is Genius and with a Amazing Song with the Sequence. \n\nThere's another great Highway Chase scene\n\nEven though there are some familiar beats, it is very much different from the first film \n\nWhile I like the villain's from the first film, the people fighting Deadpool in this (including Cable) are bigger threats especially not really spoiler anymore the Juggernaut is badass (even though he is a big CGI thing and it could of been touched up a bit), but having them makes the sequel Bigger and Darker.\n\nThe Cameos are fucking amazing \n\nThe emotional Beats definitely work.\n\nThe Bad\nTJ Miller could of been like cut or killed off somehow, his jokes in this one are forced as hell and he does absolutely nothing, they could of cut him even after his accusations and his arrest for a fake bomb threat.\n\nWhile the ending is great the thing without spoiling what Cable does especially having his motivation clear the moment you see him instantly changes for no reason really, especially when someone has a certain thing (you will see what I'm talking about).\n\nOverall: Deadpool 2 is a blast, and while it does improve certain things from the first film, but I think the First Deadpool is still a little better, by being a smaller simple film which is basically a love story while this was a family film.\n\nOverall Grade: A-",

Come young and old, not for the size of Deadpool 2\u2019s budget but for how the film uses it to rewrite history (Green Lantern\u2019s and Marvel\u2019s history that is). Deadpool 2 delivers an extraordinarily witty and outrageous film which bends the limits of fourth wall breaks to their will. Deadpool 2 builds upon the first film in new and immature ways that are unpredictable and hilarious. Ryan Reynolds opens this film with an explosive beginning (literally) and concludes it on a sweet note on family. Although the movie focuses majorly on a love letter to what Deadpool can do in an R-rated superhero flic. The film dodges many pit-falls of sequels and becomes another Empire Strikes Back. The blood and gore, the humor, the cameos, action scenes, CGI characters and excellent new and old characters in the movie, all create a Deadpool film for the ages.",

As Deadpool puts it\" Deadpool 2 is a family film.\" Well that may be a stretch but I guess you could say it's more family then the first. \nAs Deadpool teams up with his hilarious new counterparts you can't help but feel your in for a good time. New additions like Domino, who has some really clever and funny lines, Shatter Star, who offers physical humor (If you've seen the movie you'll know what I am talking about), Bedlam, once again more physical humor. As well as Bedlam and Vanisher, who offers a hilarious suprise cameo with Brad Pitt, and last but not least Peter who frankly has no powers and doesnt  last long. And who could forget the \"villian\" Cable who is played by Josh Brolin who hits it big with his second superhero film of the year.\nBrolin makes an effective Cable, even if lacking Reynolds witty remarks and quick humor as Deadpool and seeing them later team up in the film along with some familiar X-men is delicious.\nDeadpool 2 is an impressive entry in the carrer of director David Lietch, with this being only his second major motion picture, the first being Atomic Blonde(2017) and after those to films he's off to a happy start.\nIn the end Deadpool 2 brings together hero and anti-hero for a greater cause. Throwing everything it has to offer at you Deadpool 2 will leave fans grinning with the characters having more growing to do this time around. The makeup of heros we see known as X-force should have plenty of more hilarious and brutally funny adventures together.",
