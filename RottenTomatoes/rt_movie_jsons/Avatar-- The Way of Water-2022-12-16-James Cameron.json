James Cameron spent how long making THIS? All this movie will do is encourage studios to push CGI above anything else. I'm disappointed with humanity as a whole for certifying this \"fresh\". A movie that is as void of any new ideas or creativity should have been ridiculed by everyone and should have flopped. But man... I guess people just love their CGI over literally every other aspect of a movie buy a HUGE margin. \n\nAlso, I really enjoy some cartoons. But it was weird and off-putting watching a movie that wasn't a cartoon or something Pixar-like, but really pretty much is because 99% of EVERYTHING in the movie was CGI.\n\nThis movie was embarrassing.",

Some people have said that the plot for this movie was bad but I just think it was straightforward and there was nothing wrong with it.

My only complaint is that at times, scenes looked like they were from a video game. While this did affect my viewing experience slightly, it was rare and far between. The story, while incredibly simple to follow, did a fantastic job at picking up where the first one left off and did a great job at setting up the \"potential\" next 3 films. This is mostly due to the introduction of the water Na'vi clans as well as the phenomenal acting done by the new and old characters alike. The introduction of several new creatures is also really cool. This is one to see on the biggest screen possible and in 3D or 4D. It makes the film look so much more stunning than a normal theater screen. While it's not the best film of the year, it is the most beautiful looking and well-made.",

This is not the case in the sequel which spends a lot of dull moments familiarizing us with life in the water.\nThat being said, Avatar : The Way of Water is visually stunning. It has a strong script, when building the story or executing action scenes. But the script lags during those long dull moments. It benefits from a strong cast capable of making this sci-fi environment and the story believable.\nVisuals are stunning and the CGI is incredible. The diverse alien creatures are easy to accept.

The ending is known two weeks before movie's premiere, no surprises. If the plan is to have sequence after sequel, why don't you sacrifice some of the good characters to make it more articulate? I only loved the fighting sessions, not exactly new, except the cruelty when killing the (fantasy) whales. They make you feel guilty even when they are digital creatures, not to mention destroying digital nature (digital tears are welcome). I can't wait for the next two movies. Really. I mean, i will not wait! Like a did for this one. Counting the days to the release, not next time. They have managed to spend tons of money, and not coming up with anything new to add to the sci-fi genre.

While the film had stunning visuals and special effects, I found it to be lacking in terms of plot and character development. The storyline felt predictable and lacking in depth, failing to engage me as a viewer. The characters themselves felt one-dimensional and underdeveloped, making it difficult to form any emotional connections with them.\n\nIn terms of pacing, I felt that the film was inconsistent. Some parts felt rushed while others dragged on, making it difficult to maintain interest throughout the 3-hour runtime. Additionally, the themes explored in the film, such as environmentalism and corporate greed, felt clich\u00e9d and unoriginal, lacking any real depth or insight.\n\nMy 5 main reasons:\n\n\nThe Storyline: The author argues that the plot of the film is predictable and lacks depth, making it unengaging and unmemorable.\n\nThe Characters: The author believes that the characters in the film lack development and depth, making it difficult for audiences to connect with or care about them.\n\nThe Visuals: Despite the impressive special effects, the author believes that the film relies too heavily on visual spectacle, sacrificing storytelling and character development in the process.\n\nThe Themes: The author argues that the themes explored in the film, such as environmentalism and the dangers of corporate greed, are clich\u00e9d and unoriginal, lacking any real depth or insight.\n\nThe Pacing: The author feels that the film is poorly paced, with the story feeling rushed in some areas and dragging in others, making it difficult to stay engaged throughout.\n\nOverall, I was disappointed with Avatar 2 and believe that it could have been improved with more focus on character development and a stronger, more engaging plot. While the film may have appeal for some viewers, it did not resonate with me personally and left me feeling unsatisfied.",

Which are secretly being sent to Earth.\n\n5 the friendly scientists tell to the new scientists the story of the previous film and how Jake was transported from the human body to the avatar in a definitive and mystical way.\n\n6 The new scientists then ask their old ones and friends to convince jake to take tests so they can understand how this was possible that science exists behind eyaua's magic. And if this could be the way to heal the earth.\n\n7 jake goes to do tests and at the same time they discover that the substance of the whales' brain could be the energy conductor that could transfer large amounts of data without burning the receiver's brain. And they are excited to use this energy conduit to finally create eternal life for wealthy humans. Because they could manufacture bodies of avatars at the cost of billions and when the person is going to die they could buy a body and transport the mind to the avatar. But before finishing the genetic mapping Jake stops the scans and leaves.\n\n\n8 by secretly reporting the discoveries to Earth, the executives there then see the potential for profits and decide to send a special group of their armies to kidnap jake to finish the genetic mapping of the research and hunt the planet's whales for the new substance. Look what a beautiful justification for everything.\n\n9 With terrorism affecting everyday life in the village of the forest and fearing the kidnapping of one of his children, Jake decides to run away and hide in the water town.\n\n10 and from there, just take the current film and just reassemble it following this premise and, in my opinion, it would justify everything we saw in the film and it would still be possible to cut a good part and stay at 2 hours and 20.\n\n11 Just cut all that part of the new invasion and the use of the same previous villain that magicaly return again plese forgot this.\n\nVillains could be navis radical members who don't accept jake as an equal and these are the ones trying to get rid of him and take over pandora with weapons provided by humans to unbalance the fight.\n\nWhat do you think?",

Get a babysitter or dont go. Terrible that I have to pay the price for their ignorance.  Its downright rude. That movie avatar isnt for kids under 13. They dont even understand whats going on. It was highly distracting and people coughing up phlegm disgusting. No instructions on where the seat control are. I hadnt been in a while so I didnt realize they reclined so caught that in time before movie started.

            "content": "Patriarchal Stories and Matriarchal Worship, Cameron's Self\nContradictions and Divisions\n\nIn his obsession with nature, Cameron glimpses the matriarchal attributes of nature and the plundering of nature by humans, which is one of the central themes of his films.\n\nHe used many symbols to build the visual world of Avatar, such as the sky people spaceship that resembles male genitalia and the countless caves and circular designs of the Avatar world to symbolize matriarchal nature.\n\nBut the two themes expressed in his films are self-contradictory and contradictory.\n\nPerhaps it is his gender privilege that prevents him from confronting the fact that in a patriarchal society, men plunder women's wombs through the institution of marriage, just as sky people loot the wombs of natural mothers through technology, both of which are the same.\n\nSo Jake Sully, the father in his film, seems out of place in the whole matriarchal nature created by Cameron.\n\nWhile Jake, the father, is in the primary position, holding the baby in his hands, his wife Neytiri, who has just given birth, is submissively in the secondary role; the ritual is the worship of the fertility of the goddess \"mother Eva,\" this scene is an important image that contradicts the main idea of Cameron's film.\n\nOr rather, the ancient goddess again comes to man's dream world through symbols. Still, she can only exist in a nebulous dream world, either as a symbol of the goddess mother Eva, a dead female scientist, or a non-human animal Tulkun, the man once again found the goddess of nature who rules life and death. Still, he can not link her to the enslaved wife and daughter.\n\nPerhaps Cameron perceives his self-contradiction, or the fear caused by the contradiction between the two, anxiety brought about by the separation of the two powers of the female characters ruling fertility and death, so that the woman heading life away from violence (the power of death), and the woman leading violence away from fertility, can be very clearly perceived, where the female characters, all must choose, it is evident that the fertility goddesses The female characters who decide the power of death, the commander-in-chief of the Sky People Command, and the occasional woman who doesn't know her name (although these goddesses of death are suspected of deliberately good European and American feminism to make up the numbers).\n\nOf course, Cameron also thought of a way to solve the relationship between the mother and violence, the mother is the archer, but she stays away from violence most of the time; she is forbidden to initiate violence for herself, but she still plays the meek wife in daily life, taking care of the man, as well as cooking for the man, bandaging, so the mother is usually away from the violence of the Virgin, only in exceptional circumstances are allowed to use violence, that is, the son and husband Threatened. The advancement of the feminist movement allowed women to be empowered, but only if that empowerment was only for the allegiance of the patriarchal family.\n\nWhy? Because once the mother is free to use violence like the father, the father's position of absolute power is threatened, and the father's legitimate existence is inevitably questioned. In Cameron's film, the father's power comes only from death, and he must infinitely magnify the power of men's death to retain the legitimacy of men in power.\n\nWhen the ancient goddess reappears, she is the warmth of new life and brutal death. For a baby, to be looked at and loved by its mother is life, and to be ignored and neglected by its mother is dead, which is the first power structure experienced by human beings.\n\nNo matter how Cameron sings the praises of the patriarchal family, this is also a time when the patriarchal family is disintegrating, and the patriarchal family under the marriage system is gradually deteriorating.\n\nIn the matriarchal family and the patriarchal family, the empowerment of the man in the family cannot be accomplished without the woman joining the marriage. The confrontation between matriarchal and patriarchal power is also between these two kinds of families, that is, between mothers and wives.\n\nA wife is not a mother; a mother does not become a wife; it is a two-choice problem for women, a wife who surrogates children for her husband and a mother who chooses genes for her children.\n\nNatural mothers are brutal and cold, do not create offspring for any male, and look coldly at the male competition, the weak die, and the strong win, mothers always choose the winner, even if they choose the same winner, but it does not mean that the mother will become a wife, the winner is always changing, and the mother's choice is constantly changing.\n\nThe people who enslave their mothers will be enslaved; totalitarianism is birthed in patriarchy, this is the punishment of man for turning mothers into wives, but it is not the only punishment, nor is it the heaviest.\n\nHumans have already lost their mothers, so every child has a lifelong lack of so-called sweet drama in the male lead, unconditional love, and attention to the heroine of the male information to provide shelter and security for women. Are they the real man? In nature, only the mother is unconditional love and shelter existence humans look for love as children look for their mothers.\n\nThe role of the father in the patriarchal family is to imitate the missing mother, but it is not like men to be mothers; sexuality is the final point of their reproduction; they are born unable to link with their babies, they are frightened, widowed, frequent cheaters, rely on authority to maintain legitimacy (like the awkward father in Avatar), but they are also missing mothers, people look to their wives, to their husbands, even People look to their wives, to their husbands, and even to their children and those in power for motherly love. Still, the traces of mothers have long disappeared into history, and love has become control, kidnapping, and deprivation.\n\nFor too long, humanity has been without mothers, and wives who are disappointed in their husbands are even raising their children as their mothers, demanding attention, motherhood, and shelter from them.\n\nWe all hope that Eva, the mother goddess, will return to earth, she is as we imagine, powerful, warm, cruel, breeding life, but she also brings death, although at this time she is still far away, all the children lacking a mother are longing for her.\n\nUntil then, humans can only become their mothers.",

You would never know the entire movie is CGI with the actors acting out their roles in front of green screen with no sets or props. \n\nI watched it in a smaller theater, so probably didn't get the whole 3D experience, but, some of the 3D was really good. But, have seen better. It was also a really great story.\n\nThe only thing that keeps it from being a 5 is that the human boy made no sense.\nNever explained why he was there, or how they ended up with him.\n\nThe only thing I could figure is that they needed an inside guy to cover various plots in the movie. So, that was kind of distracting from the story a bit.\n\nAlso it was not as good as the first Avatar. But, the effects and the genius work put into the film is pretty amazing. Can't imagine what it must have been like to act without anything but green screen to interact with. It was really good.",

            "content": "it was a long breath hold, but Cameron finally made it. he gave us a complete, comprehensive (at most times) and an overall pretty satisfying experience at the cinema once again only to leave us wanting for more.\n\nthis film is in every way better than the first. the story has heart, the battles pack an emotional punch, the visuals want you to pack your bags and leave for pandora, and most of the events happen naturally throughout the course of the film. I think cameron actually listened to some of the criticism which has been going throughout the years for the first avatar movie and actually tried to tell a better and more engaging story whilst providing us with a technical achievement.\n\nfirst of all, talking about the visual effects and the cinematography (which are the film's core strengths), it's just mind-boggling. I haven't got the slightest idea how they managed to achieve the shots they have on-screen. each and every frame of this film can be a wallpaper and no one would complaint. cinematographer Russell Carpenter really manages to keep your eyes glued to the screen with his abilities. despite most of the actors being the Na'vi this time, you can't tell that they are not real. each and every Na'vi looks insane and meticulously detailed which helps us to differentiate the focus characters when a large no. of them are present in frame. the vfx team deserve all the respect for this.\n\nnow, talking about the performances, they're all spot on and not a single loose thread can be seen. Worthington as Jake Sully/Toruk Makto might be a problematic father but everything gets all right in the end when he shares a moment with his son Lo'ak which was probably one of the best emotional moments from the film. Zoe Salda\u00f1a, whose character Neytiri takes a backseat in the overall film does more than required in the scenes she's in and proves to us that she is an important and irreplaceable character in the entire series. Stephen Lang being given a much better role this time around manages to be a worthy antagonist for the Na'vi and has a much more personal involvement in his battle against the Sully's. loved to hate him in the film. the standouts for me particularly were Sigourney Weaver as Kiri and Britain Dalton as Lo'ak who get to do the most in the film and press most of the emotional buttons.\n\nanother thing which I liked and disliked at the same time was the frame rate. the film for most of it's runtime runs at a dazzling 48 frames per second but for some reason cuts to the standard 24 frames per second in between shots. this was really distracting and at times took me out of the scene. i think cameron struggled to maintain the frame rates of the shots and should've gone with either of the two instead of keeping them both.\n\nnow, talking about the story, it's better than the first alright but still doesn't quite get interesting where it could match the amount of technical marvel which was being displayed on screen. Cameron does write a better story than the first but at the beginning, it sure does feel like the film is a sequel, just for the sake of being a sequel when the sky people go and return within 5 minutes of the runtime whereas in reality, it has been decades since they first left. that just feels lazy and cinematic liberty taken too far. the emotional weight is much more significant than the first and the final battle feels like an emotional ride, although I would need more than this predictable story to step in the theatres for the next film as I was able to tell each and every single thing that was going to happen next right from the moment things start to happen.\n\noverall, I'd say do not miss this in the theatres even if the story is weak because it's better than the first presented to you on a plate of visually dazzling shots with some great performances.",

But let's cut the crap. Bad News first, as always.\n\nThe movie tries too hard to emotionally connect to the audience through scenes where family bonding in prominent. Like, way to hard. Sure, it got the reactions of sorrow for sure, and it definitely calls for being an emotional movie because of this, but it causes other things to be ignored or pushed aside. There was no clash or fight for screen time. Most of this movies screen time was family moments, and that wouldn't be bad if this wasn't an action movie.\n\nThe family moments or the scenes trying to introduce you to all these new concepts are dragged on and makes a very exponential climax that just kind of appeared like a a final boss, not built up to over time, and it doesn't feel right. It feels like a very forced climax. There were a lot of ideas just shoved into a feature length film. They don't want to have to make a sequel to the sequel, so they rushed this into a smaller time frame than the plot could handle.\n\nAnother thing is certain scenes have a lot of animation inconsistencies. It doesn't seem to appear to be able to decide on a specific FPS rate, and it really messes with your eyes, especially on the big screen. \n\nIt's good enough to watch, as the elements of action were amazing to watch and very engaging. It introduces new characters that are easy to root for and care for, and have complex stories of their own to tell. This movie has other good things, but over all, this movie is just above average.

A revenge story with a mediocre character that died in the first film for over 3 hours? Yikes. I kept thinking, \"there must be more to do this,\" but there wasn't. There were many, many holes throughout, in relationships especially...I could not connect with the characters so loved from the first film nor any of the new characters.

            "content": "Avatar: The Way of Water represents a positive trend, alongside recent titans such as Top Gun: Maverick and (to an extent) Elvis, back to the old-school thinking of making a blockbuster. Of course, this is unsurprising with James Cameron creating some of the biggest spectacles Hollywood has churned out and with the first Top Gun being as old-school blockbuster as it gets. However, with Marvel and superhero films hegemonising the modern blockbuster-scape and with little room for any competition to adequately shine, it is surprising the sequel to a 13-year old film managed to be the commercial and critical success it has. Avatar reminds Hollywood a blockbuster should not be a lineage of successive films akin to a game of trivia, but ought to be an experience which justifies the price of a cinema ticket.\n\nThe Avatar sequel has managed to rekindle interest among cinemagoers for huge CGI spectacles with blockbusters being oversaturated with dodgy 'hit-and-miss' visual effects, by pushing the boundaries (once again) of what is possible. Perhaps the greatest achievement of this film is not its revolutionary use of computer technology to render an alien world without looking overtly fake, or stressing the eyes of the viewer to the point of irritation, but to do so without alienating its audience and creating it believably with a sense of  familiarity. A world crafted so intricately and with so much personal dedication from its director, visual effects teams and concept artists, that it is difficult to overstate the sense of artistry and personality in the film. \n\nComplimenting the visuals, the score expertly composed by Simon Franglen (as a replacement of the late James Horner) is fundamental to the creation of a world of such beauty and virility, and the immersion within the depths of the rich ocean or intimidating landscapes of the forest. Franglen builds off Horner's magic with an equally rich score which helps convey the enormity of Pandora, and is reflective of the enchanting setting. \n\nThe Way of Water does indeed have its weaknesses, as any film does and ought to strive to, as to create a piece of art is to make mistakes. The inconsistent frame rate contradicts the verisimilitude of the world and its characters, and would otherwise be better left without bar some isolated sequences. Further, James Cameron has always been spotty with dialogue, and Avatar: The Way of Water is no exception in some sequences, with ill-thought writing choices holding back some otherwise exceptional and dramatic sequences - as well as its characters. Further, the narrative is indeed somewhat derivative and hardly stands out as the most original screenplay - just as with most blockbusters - however, it does not distract from the films subtext and key messages, nor does it from the world it creates. \n\nAs with much of Cameron's other projects, the subtext is clear - the environment and its creatures are important and ought not be destroyed for profit, and the mistreatment of indigenous people is a stain on human connection. Of course, this acts as a sufficient and poignant socio-cultural criticism, offering an interesting enough narrative. With most modern-blockbusters serving only the commercial interests of studios at the expense the auteurship and creativity, Avatar stands out as an example of a film which can do both when a studio vests power and trust in an individual willing to push the boundaries of today's cinema. \n\nAlthough the film certainly is not perfect, it is representative of a positive trend, which studios will hopefully follow which could see a total overhaul of the modern blockbuster akin to those of yesteryear.",

Well characterized, with realistic family dynamics. I found the bullying scenes of the younger son a bit clich\u00e9 to be honest (true, but clich\u00e9) but overall solid story.\nThe movie is a fun experience, but sometimes a bit too heavy in CGI, which might at times come across as animation-like, even on the big screen I watched it on.

The sky people hadn't learnt anything from their first visit. I was expecting an evolution in the story. I was hoping they had been humbled and became curious to understand how the Avatars connect with the nature spirits, and maybe they could have had a transformation of sorts themselves.\n\nEven back in the day of founding white Australia the colonisers were aware of the mess they had made in America and other places and were at least trying to do it slightly better. (spolier: they didn't, but that's another story). In this movie the sky people are one-dimensional nasty killers at any cost (all those massive resources on another planet to catch one person was a weak plot line in itself). \n\nIt could have told a really important story for our times about the pursuit of working with difference in cultures and seeking mutually beneficial outcomes. eg. It could have been really nuanced with some of the sky people \"getting it\" and some of them stuck in the old dominator military ways. It would set up an epic heroic journey about creating civilisation amongst differing cultures - giving us hints about how we can now change our trajectory away from glorifying technology and military, and towards a meaningful and subtle connection to nature and divinity - whilst also bringing differing world views and cultures together. It's a story we really need to hear right now with all the polarisation that is going on in the world.\n\nInstead it was mostly glorifying military, giving people lots of visceral ideas about how to combine AI with military - super scary as they make it look so powerful, agile and sexy. The action sequences were classic juvenile testosterone Hollywood - completely over the top.\n\nNot only were the sky people not moved by the magic of the Navi's, they were downright angry about it - trying to kill the one person who had built a bridge between the two cultures. This is the worst-case scenario story that could have been told for Avatar 2.\n\nIt was all about revenge. Plus lots of old-school masculine loyalty tropes in there that feel quite dated in the 2020s. And the fact that they saved the villain to fight another day is so \ud83e\udd2e. It suggests that the next movie is going to be more of the same.\n\nOn a positive note the magical forest and underwater scenes were the highlight - so glorious, connecting and inspiring. This will inspire the nature-loving folk. But the high tech AI weaponry will likely arouse the non-thinking, gun-toting, right wing macho crowd who are all about defending their patch. It makes high tech military look exciting, sexy and inevitable. It normalises a dystopian future (like so many other hollywood movies do).\n\nPerhaps the making of this movie is a mirror of our times - it got so distracted in it's own high technology that it totally missed the substance of the story telling.",

The environments, the underwater shots are groundbreaking, sometimes that won't be topped anytime soon. As for the rest of the film though in terms of story and characters, it seriously lacks. When I wasn't focused on the beautiful world I was quite uninvested with how Cameron executed the story. It was basically the same as the first time around only it's the bad guy who gets most of the screen time played effectively by Stephen Lang.

            "content": "If you can believe it, Avatar: The Way of Water, the movie a decade in the making, tops the visual masterpiece of the original, Avatar. Be warned that this movie is a commitment as it is over three hours long! \n \nJake Sully (Sam Worthington), the human transformed into a Na'vi person, and his wife Ney'tiri (Zoe Salda\u00f1a) are back and now have four kids. With the unexpected return of the wicked Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang), who is brought back as a Na'vi impersonator along with his crew, the Sully's are forced to flee the forest and explore what other places on Pandora, their home planet, have to offer. \n \nSince this is the sequel to the mega-hit film, Avatar, I recommend watching the first film before viewing this one, as there are many important references and details that are key to following this film. The storyline leaves us with some more questions than answers; however it sets up moviegoers for the next installments. Viewing it on a big screen, especially in 3D \u2013 which I recommend \u2013 makes you feel like you're right beside the characters in the world of Pandora. Speaking of Pandora, the world building is absolutely remarkable. It expands our view of this amazing foreign planet. And as the name suggests, it focuses on the islands, oceans and reefs of Pandora. The aquatic plants and animals are majestic and gorgeously iridescent. The reefs and oceans are eye popping and staggering. Everything is so glowy and vivacious. If you thought the animation of the original film was awe-inspiring, wait until you watch this one! The animation is hyper-realistic. When looking closely, you can see the ultra-detailed textures of the characters and settings. The movement almost looks like it is from a cut scene of a video-game (it's honestly the best way I can describe it). Stephen Lang's performance as the Colonel is so powerful, and makes you hate his guts even more than you did in the first film. Sam Worthington as Jake and Zoe Salda\u00f1a as Ney'tiri seem to have developed even better chemistry than in the first movie.\n \nThe message of this movie is to always fight to protect loved ones. This movie also has strong messages about the bonds with family and friends. Be forewarned that there is violence and violence involving animals. \n \nI give Avatar: The Way of Water 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults.

Overall the story is pretty thin, even for a \"kid's movie\". (that goes forever).\n\nPut it this way, James Cameron: you are bland. Your vibe is bland and it's not going to change. The only way to really make A2:WOW really work would be to have a GREAT opening scene, with thriller elements and an intense action sequences unfolding, without pointless excess or emotionless sentiment. Cameron, either because of his ego or simply because Titanic \"made a lot of money\" doesn't get this idea of carved-to-it's-essence story economy anymore. The film feels dilute and thin as a dramatic work and has, occasionally, very pleasing and carefully rendered computer graphics animations. As usual, people are raising complaints about the lack of natural frame blending we associate with 25 fps, and \"super-high-whizz\" 60 fps. \n\nTo be honest, audience backlash against this film is everywhere, so it may shade your view of what is, basically, a solid action/adventure film - it's almost like a b-movie where the characters aren't real and the plot is underdeveloped but it goes boom crash bang (splash).",

I have a simple criteria for rating movies, can you see the money spent on the screen? In this case, you surely can.  Yes, it is very long, but it would be a shame not to meander through some of the most breathtaking CGI made to date.  If you are going to go big, then go crazy big.  This movie (somewhat like its predecessor) needs to be seen on the biggest screen to get the full experience.  Is the plot a bit rehashed? Yes, but there is just enough new stuff that it clears the originality bar (even if just by a little bit).  Perfect? No, but you can see the money spent on the screen and you can have a good time if you invest the attention span.",

My worries were destroyed and my anticipation was not disappointed. Obviously this movie is Oscar worthy in so many categories, particularly the visuals, my god what a treat for the eyes this movie was.

It's the sequel to \"Avatar\" and it took approximately 5 years to complete. \n\nPersonally, I loved everything about this film. But let's go bit by bit. The first obvious thing that comes to mind when watching this movie are the visual effects. I felt drawn to the story. I literally couldn't take my eyes off of it. The colors are extremely bright and rich. Even the smallest object was extremely thought out. No two colors on the screen clashed for even a second. In my personal experience, watching the movie in 3D was the right decision to make. It allowed me to submerge myself almost completely into every aspect of the film.\n\nAnother facet I really enjoyed was the soundtrack. I've always loved music, and listening to brand new pieces of what in my opinion are masterpieces completely blew my mind. Every single instrument heard was in tune and actively participated in making a well rounded experience overall.\n\nSomething that still amazes me till this day is the amount of special effects that we don't even notice sometimes. The number of things we overlook without even knowing are scandalous. The realism of every single invented character is astonishing. The amount of detail and effort put into creating each individual with its own physical and psychological characteristics is very easy to leave unnoticed.\n\nIn summary, I wholeheartedly believe that everyone who loves cinema should watch this film which I'm sure will be very much enjoyed.",

So don't expect to get everything all at once.. As It Seems our culture is all about instant gratification these days. Sorry, you're going to have to wait for a more complete saga.. not 14 yrs though.. & while this does round off fairly neatly as a sequel to the first Avatar, being a Powerhouse of audio and visual feasts throughout. It's definitely set up for even more interesting immersive feature scapes to dive into or sore through the Hallelujah mountains.",

In fact, I put the glasses on the end of my nose so I could look over the top of them during the scenes that didn't have much 3D effect. That did not help the colors other than they weren't quite as dark. \nIt was very disappointing! I expected it to be beautiful and rich as I remembered it on the first movie. \nSTORY:\nI enjoyed the story. It seemed to fit as a \"what happened as time passed\".

I am still unsure if the idea of bringing back Quaritich was a good idea (as opposed to creating a younger, different antagonist) - I guess a combination of how well Lang's performance in the original Avatar movie and perhaps lack of better ideas - but that really is the only somewhat questionable part to me - as overall I didn't find the plot as weak as critics note - and interestingly the extreme length was also totally bearable, even enjoyable.

As a piece of entertainment, it completely lives up to the promise of a futuristic blockbuster and a sequel to the most successful film of all time, big worldbuilding with classic family and adventure elements; few directors can make a three hour runtime feel exciting and fresh, helped along by visuals that blow away just about anything that's come before. Plus, crab robots. \n\nWhat rubs me the wrong way is the shameless double dipping. The film works and is worth your time (at least until other production companies catch up to the technical capabilities in a few years), but let's not pretend that Cameron isn't putting a very expensive coat of paint on the proven formula from the original. Not only are the themes about environmental exploitation and colonialism almost entirely unchanged, but some of the more specific details are just going through token reskins so audiences don't get bored - forest Na'vi are replaced by ocean Na'vi (and there's already a promise that fire Na'vi are going to turn up in a sequel), unobtainium is replaced by a new hyper-expensive resource called amrita that not only stops aging but can only be obtained by drilling into the brains of space whales, and instead of making new villains, the script just says \"oh all the old bad guys that died? Their personalities were all saved so they're back again.\" \n\nUndeniably a fun watch that capitalizes on the strengths of the original film, but Cameron's ideas don't really get smarter, just bigger. And the next iteration is guaranteed to be a color palette swap, hopefully it will have some new ideas to go along with it. But this filmmaker clearly understands both his audience and entertainment value, so who am I to criticize? (3.5/5)",

However it's not long before the sly people show up again in Pandora.... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.\n\nCouple of comments: After many years of delays, the long awaited sequel from James \"King of the World\" Cameron is FINALLY released. To be honest, it's been so long (13 years) that I don't remember much of the plot of the original Avatar, but I do recall the immersive viewing experience that it was. For this sequel, it seems that Cameron is concerned that a complex storyline might distract us and hence there is very little plot, basically that forest people becoming sea people are GOOD, and that sky people are BAD. Around that paper-thin premise, Cameron builds a visual spectacle that intends to encompass and overwhelm you, and guess what: Cameron succeeds. Along the way, Cameron liberally borrows from Star Wars (the sky people's main vessel is the ocean-equivalent of the Death Star), and from his own Titanic. Is the movie too long? Frankly yes and the initial 60-75 min. could've/should've been trimmed quite a bit. But in the end, enjoy it for what it is: a visual experience unlike anything you've ever experienced. And did I tell you that forest people becoming sea people are GOOD? And that sky people are BAD?\n\n\"Avatar: The Way of Water\" opened in December and we saw it on Christmas day. The afternoon/early evening XD 3D screening where we saw it at here in Cincinnati was well attended but nowhere near sold out, somewhat to my surprise. If you saw the original Avatar and enjoyed it, I'd readily suggest you check out this sequel, and draw your own conclusion.",

It is a must watch and if you have questions or are confused after seeing it the first time watch it again and it will make more sense. I was unfortunately too young to see Avatar 1 because I was only 5. When i did see the first one in 2012 it was amazing because it was so new and magical. I watched the first one multiple times back to back because of how amazing it is. I saw The second one 3 times. The first time was in standard and it was great, 3D was great because it made me feel like i was there (sounds cringe worthy), then the last time i saw it in 3D Dbox and it is worth everything because when the seat move when they fly or swim and the rumble and motion in fight scenes make you feel like you are right there even more. If anyone still hasn't seen it i recommend you see it in 3D Dbox because it is 5000% worth it, especially a movie like Avatar The Way of Water.\nAlso recommend watching the first one before seeing the new one for obvious reasons.",

The sheep keep following whatever the commercial tells them to do. I don't even feel like the effects are that captivating where I thought the movie would even be worth a second viewing.

Watching the movie was nothing less than a visual treat for my eyes.\n\n2. While the first movie saw that Na'vi people fought back with the sense of revenge, Avatar 2 made sure that it is not going to be typical mainstream movies where villain hits you, and you hit back and it's over. The emotions that it required to generate the sense of will for Jake Sully to fight for his family, is really what a man really would do when facing extreme circumstances, one would only fight and risk everything if he lost something so dear to him, an act which was so cruel done to him that it justified in his mind to go to war.\n\n3. Character development of every character, i mean every character happens. The scream of Neytiri was one of the most touching scene i felt from the movie.\n\nFor the first time one can say that watching a movie felt like reading through a fine written novel. No words can do justice to do the beauty that i experienced. Watched it 3 times already and still feel the need to watch it for the fourth time.",

I would recommend this film to people who are unsure about watching it and will continue to keep watching the sequels to come. Besides the long wait time and needing to use the restroom I would recommend not drinking anything until the first hour in the movie.

Se tard\u00f3 13 a\u00f1os en crear y expandir este mundo, explorando el mundo marino en documentales c\u00f3mo \u2018Deepsea Challenge' o \u2018Diving Deep', documentales por si mismos fant\u00e1sticos, y se traslada esa vida y ese realismo a esta cinta, ya sea en primer o segundo plano hay una ambici\u00f3n por construir y tele transportar al espectador al mundo de pandora, y creo que lo logra. As\u00ed mismo con los actores que m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de sus actuaciones, el trabajo f\u00edsico por el que tuvieron que pasar 100% vale la pena, Kate Winslet logr\u00f3 estar 7 minutos bajo el agua, es una dedicaci\u00f3n realmente incre\u00edble, se puede sentir esa conexi\u00f3n de los actores con sus personajes.\n\nLa trama es una cr\u00edtica a la misma ambici\u00f3n humana y a su \"justificaci\u00f3n de la supervivencia\", la pel\u00edcula toma nuevamente ese foco contra los humanos que puede llegar a sentirse inc\u00f3modo ver al estereotipado \"h\u00e9roe\" de cualquier historia c\u00f3mo el antagonista, cada acci\u00f3n de los humanos realmente duele lo real que se siente, los humanos son destructivos, no les importa lo que pueden pisar o destruir con total de llegar a su objetivo que se vuelve tangible en la nefasta escena de la ballena, en la que sale a relucir c\u00f3mo toman lo que les interesa de cualquier ser vivo volvi\u00e9ndolos desechables para seguir con su objetivo, que es una referencia a la ya extinta moda de piel de animal a las figuras de marfil o productos que se basan de recursos de seres vivos, y as\u00ed mismo en la destrucci\u00f3n del habitad de otras especies, pueden reforestar, incendiar con el \u00fanico prop\u00f3sito de sobre explotar y adue\u00f1arse de los recursos, para inflar los bolsillos de una minor\u00eda que no le interesa nada m\u00e1s all\u00e1 que su propio sustento. Una cosa que no me encant\u00f3 de la pel\u00edcula fue que no haya un protagonista claro, la pel\u00edcula explora los arcos de cada personaje en paralelo sin establecer el real conflicto interno de los personajes, la narrativa transiciona de un sub arco a otro, no cerrando con cada uno de ellos c\u00f3mo el de Kiri o rest\u00e1ndole importancia a personajes c\u00f3mo Neytiri, cosa que llega a afectar al mismo Jake; pero aun as\u00ed la trama es lo suficientemente autosustentable para seguir desarrollando a sus personajes aunque sea de una forma \"convencional\" con la trama principal, el conflicto interno principal de los personajes me parece fabuloso, salir de su tierra para as\u00ed mismo llegar a una completamente diferente y luchar para aprender su cultura es hermoso, es narrativamente lo que m\u00e1s me gust\u00f3, que s\u00ed, puede llegar a ser un poco extensa la resoluci\u00f3n del mismo conflicto, pero visualmente es hermoso ver c\u00f3mo exploran el oc\u00e9ano as\u00ed mismo cuando exploran la aldea, la pel\u00edcula puede ser sobre explicativa o ambigua en varias ocasiones, pero todo eso se tapa con el hermoso mundo que nos presenta esta historia, ya sea en el 1 acto con el mundo que ya conocemos que sigue siendo igual de hermoso con esa aura de \"peligro\" as\u00ed mismo con el mundo acu\u00e1tico, la pel\u00edcula cuando busca ser expositiva con su mundo es una experiencia \u00fanica. La pel\u00edcula se puede quitar el clich\u00e9 que injustamente se le catalog\u00f3. \n\nJames Cameron hace una maestr\u00eda en la construcci\u00f3n de su mundo, cada secuencia es espectacular, la creaci\u00f3n de la fauna es hermosa, cada ser vivo se siente real; algo muy complicado de hacer, aunque se recreen los animales que ya conocemos. Los Na'vi se sienten reales, sus expresiones se sienten genuinas as\u00ed mismo con sus movimientos, es incre\u00edble lo emp\u00e1tico que pueden llegar a ser con el espectador. La fotograf\u00eda llega a sentirse por momentos naturalista, hay escenas que parece que se est\u00e1n grabando desde un avi\u00f3n, que siento que es algo que busc\u00f3 lograr Russell Carpenter, hay zooms que dan referencia a los mismos documentales de Cameron, y para mi ese es el logro t\u00e9cnico m\u00e1s grande de la pel\u00edcula, el hacer sentir al espectador que est\u00e1 viendo algo m\u00e1s que un mundo construido digitalmente, esta cinta hace sentir al espectador que est\u00e1 viendo un documental de Pandora. No hay palabras para describir esta experiencia, visualmente la pel\u00edcula es \u00fanica, es incre\u00edble lo real que se siente este mundo.\n\nAvatar 2, es una experiencia inversiva a otra realidad que en cada aspecto es hermosa.",

            "content": "Never bet against Jim Cameron! My honest opinion of Avatar The Way of Water \u2026 cinematic masterpiece!! No one knows how to capture action scenes that are so powerful and mind blowing like Jim Cameron. On top of that his movie's always manage to pull me in from an emotional point of view \u2026 pulling at heart strings and making you feel something that most other movies do not. I will say \u2026 this film actually broke me which is hard to do. This is Avatar The Way of Water \u2026 it is just awe inspiring and beautiful in it's visuals, it's storytelling and action sequences. I have been to see it 4 times \u2026 it is that good! Yes it is a little long and for me you could remove perhaps 20 minutes or so of this movie which would actually make it just as good if not better but it is nit picking. The score is amazing too. I was a little worried with the passing of the great James Horner (RIP) and was wondering who could take over from him but Simon Franglen knocks it out of the park \u2026 bravo! I am invested in this world fully now and i cannot wait for the third movie to come out. My 7 year old daughter absolutely loved it too..sat there for the duration never getting bored. She often talks about it and considers it her fav movie now. A MUST SEE at the cinema in 3D on the biggest best screen you can find. Matter of fact \u2026 cinema exists for movie's like Avatar The Way of Water.\n I SEE YOU !!",

Yelling and constantly shooting each other for an hour with the sound of machine guns blasting from the theater speakers is not what I came for. In my opinion, it was really basic. The characters could have had a lot more personality but with CGI films it's not as necessary with added visuals. And I got used to the visuals REALLY fast. A friend of a friend's younger brother also saw it and said \"it was awesome.\" He's 10, so maybe I wasn't the target age. I hate making bad reviews, but personally, I don't see why people like it.

The graphics and effects are still the best in industry. The 3D effect still looks impressive. And of course the main problem is still in story and setting.\nWorld of Pandora looks too unrealistic. It's like a little distorted version of Earth. Na'vi are just bigger humans with almost the same structure as Earth's humans. Animals and plants are just little changed versions of Earth's ones. The theme of intelligent planet is poorly covered. We have a strange version of the Noosphere. \nThe movie still has a very simple plot. We have a conflict between ultra-green aborigines and ultra-military humans. I wish the plot had more mature anti-capitalism and anti-imperialism ideas.\nFinally, Avatar: The Way of Water is still a great winter blockbuster because of impressive graphics and effects. But the plot might be more mature and more realistic.",

The Avatar films have been ones that I see for the visuals themselves and not the actual story and once again, the visuals are absolutely incredible. I'm glad that Cameron decided to hold off on making this movie until the technology was there because it really shows but it can be weird at times. Whenever the characters go underwater, it feels like the film was shot on the world's best IPhone. I mean that as both a positive and negative. The visuals look amazing but the frame rate is different and makes it feel weird. As beautiful as the underwater scenes are, it can be jarring when we go back to the surface as the frame rate is different. As with the first Avatar as well, the story is okay. In fact, the story is a little bit worse here as it feels like a 2 hour movie stretched to 3. The characters and acting are kind of all over the place here quality wise. Some of the acting is good like Zoe Salda\u00f1a and Kate Winslet but other actors like Sam Worthington aren't doing a great job but Sam Worthington's character is great here but Kate Winslet's doesn't feel important (for now). While the story is just okay, I'm not going to an Avatar movie for the story and I'm going for the visuals and since the visuals are so good then I feel satisfied with the movie. If James Cameron keeps making visually spectacular movies then I'll keep showing up. If you enjoyed the first Avatar or want a visually breathtaking movie then I would definitely check this out.",

The movie feels like a remake of the first movie just with the main character from the first movie already a native for kicking off a trilogy. I noticed that there were 5 writers credited for the script, but the quality of the story has not improved in any way. Rather than making the progress of the story a credible result of character and its development, characters are driven by the story to where they need to be and there is no discernible character development. The overall tone of the movie is very conservative with women lacking key roles other than one of them working as an actual deus-ex-machina. Sam Worthington as narrator is not good and it is annoying how often he talks about a father's job to protect. But the writers are on his side ignoring Saldana's role.",

You would think the point of cloning the big bad guy was to continue on the humans mission to takeover pandora and not what is seems to be, give a guy with a vendetta all the money and equipment he needs to go \"get his revenge\" instead. How did targeting that 1 family help the humans in their efforts to overthrow pandora? They said earth was unlivable and they needed to colonize pandora. They could've just continued to attack  on the forests since clearly that is where the minerals are that they're looking for and the resources are etc. To go all the way out to fight in the ocean? With sea people? How did that make any sense? It's not like the humans decided they were gonna colonize the oceans before the lands ?! So they pretty much took all their resources to go fight to kill 1 family the bad guy has a grudge against?!. That's so idiotic! \n2.  Sully pretty much packed up his bags like a coward and tried to hideaway with the sea people. He left the Forrest clan to their own fate as there is no way him leaving would've meant they were safe and joining the sea people put the sea people at risk. Why didn't he think \"oh no the same thing is happening as before, let me lead our people against them again\" since you know - we did that in the first movie and kicked all the humans off the planet?? \n3. Them being forest people now learning to be sea people was literally a repeat of the first movie of sully learning to be a Naavi \u2026 super lazy. \n4. Why keep the bad guy alive at the end when he threatens to never stop until he kills them. - is this supposed to make me want to watch the 3rd movie? Coz it literally the same fucking plot again.

When you wonder, \"How can Cameron ever follow up on the original Avatar?\", this movie provides a stunning answer.  In the original Avatar, the 3D at times was a bit overpowering, and one sometimes had the conscious feeling \"these characters are just animations.\"  In The Way of the Water, 3D is employed much more subtly and the CGI is so good, the \"reality\" of it all is like WOW!   The thing that drives the plot is not so much the overall good guys vs. bad guys aspect of the movie but the eternal coming-of-age problems and fitting into or rebelling against the world you're born into and the frenemies you have to live with to survive.  At least for me, after the movie, it was the character situations that stuck with me, not so much the blockbuster special effects - those serve to highlight the characters' dilemmas of choices.",

Avatar 2 is basically a fantasy SeaWorld performance mixed with Evil Humans and Their Guns\u2122. Through some biological genetic engineering BS, your favorite villains are back, Sully has a whole flock of kids with easily forgettable names, and a whole new digital playground to do their Xena war chants in. The concept of the new N'avi (I forget their names, so I'll just call the the sea people) is actually pretty cool. I like the differences in biology they have from the forest N'avi. The concept of the hyper-intelligent whales with the four eyes being \"spirit sisters/brothers\" is also really fun and a nice twist, and they're integrated pretty well into the story, both the sea people and the whales. Jake Sully really gives off Mel Gibson in Braveheart vibes to me here, and I can't be the only one who thinks that. \n\nSome of the performances via the digital skin-suits are actually quite moving, and though I didn't see it in 3D, I could really tell the technology has been improved. I won't spoil it, but some of the sequences between the Sully clan really had me tearing up a bit. The idea of Kiri (who's the only kid's name I can remember) being essentially Grace's spiritual successor is kind of strange, but also fairly intriguing. \n\nI will use this to segway into some plot holes I saw. First off, who IS the father? It's hinted at in the movie but never said (maybe next film?). Also, why can the sea people speak the same N'avi language as the forest N'avi, despite living hundreds of miles away in an isolated island chain? Aren't there dialects on this moon? And why do they all suddenly start speaking ENGLISH of all things after a few introductory scenes in N'avi? Why would any of the sea people speak English? In addition, how can the N'avi communicate with the whales, exactly? Do they understand each other's language, or is it a telepathic thing? It's never explained. Also (and kind of spoiler alert), why exactly does Kiri seize up when she's connected to the spirit tree? So the humans say it's epilepsy, but it's never confirmed or expanded upon or used anywhere else in the film. Just a red herring kind of left to die. And exactly WHEN did that rogue whale get attacked by the humans anyway? The harpoon in its fin is rusted, so I assume a long time ago, but the humans have only been back on Pandora for a few months(?) in the film.\n\nI don't know where else to put this, so I'll add here that I felt like a lot of the extended underwater effects sequences were grandstanding on Cameron's part, showing us the new tech demo reel for almost half an hour at some points (felt like, at least) without really advancing the plot very much. Yes, we get it, your world is very pretty. Can we move on now? It felt like showing off for the sake of showing off.\n\nI did love the new characters, the kids, the sea N'avi (the hot little daughter, ahem), and they made the teenagers feel like teenagers. Some got a fair amount of fleshing out, but some didn't get much time to shine. The whale characters were nice touches (as I've said), but honestly it's hard to relate on an emotional level to something that only bellows and grunts for language, and looks at your longingly with one of its four eyes.\n\nThe way the movie finishes is also kind of disappointing. It was quite epic, as Cameron is known for, but also fairly predictable. But without spoiling I WILL say they are clearly setting the series up for the third movie with a few key plot points at the end, and it frustrated me. Why that way? Just be done with it and move on. Overall, however, I had a lot of fun. It was not quite the magic that the first movie had in 2009, even with the expanded runtime and better scenery. I've seen many of these concepts already 13 years ago, and it's not quite as fresh and mind-blowing for me the second time around. It was fun enough, though, that I probably would see it a second time. Not the deepest or most complex story in fantasy, but it expands the world very well, and even tells some (rather not-so-subtle) earth-first parables that we as humans should start paying attention to.",

I considered \"Best Picture\" to be a legit bar to measure the value of a movie, until this year, when they nominated Avatar 2.  Tonight, to keep my best picture watching intact, I sat through Avatar 2's over 3 hours run time, and my objective opinion is:  \"it was a giant waste of my time watching this ginormous piece of excrement.\"  I saw the original years ago in the theater and the total of what I remember is \"blue people\" and \"the special effects were nice\".  I never once thought, \"why didn't they make Avatar 2?\" And after sitting in the theater for well over 3 hours, I am just irked at Hollywood for their senseless nomination of a bloated, violent, and pointless, film that burgeons audiences with the theme  that the is US military are violent, imperialist a-holes with a side idiot Kiwis joining in.  Any opportunity you of a meaningful story was missed when the captive audiences start looking at their watches 45 mins in to see how much more they have to sit through, since their butts and attention span are already at their limit.  Pandering to James Cameron's arrogance to make movie that no one needed and cost 1/2 a billion dollars to make just shows how little Hollywood actually cares about film quality or the intelligence of their audiences.  And due to this lapse in reasonable judgement of the academy, I have now changed my best picture watching quest rules to explicitly exclude ever watching any film James Cameron makes again, and will Riley question what Hollywood considers \"quality\" going forward.",

Weird brand of revisionist sexism that one.\n\nThe repeated line \"A Father Protects - it's what gives his life meaning\" sounded like some misogynistic tagline from the '50s. Awful.",

If it wasn't one of the prettiest movies I've seen I might have walked out. Seems like since they couldn't rip off the Ferngully plot again they had no ideas to work with. Literally every turn of the story relied on either the kids, or someone supposedly smart, doing something dumb... again. And for *no real reason* other than the story needed to f'ing move eventually. And then when they do, the badguys literally pop out from around a corner in the opposite direction they were previously at.\nSpeaking of... The main bad guys were the dumbest handwave retcon I've ever seen and it only added to the story once. For a short moment. And then they literally move the story to another continent. It served no purpose other than to ... I dunno? Be cool? Not have to rehash the robot thing from the last movie? It was dumb.\nThey let a captive enemy combatant just roam around wherever he wanted and do whatever he wanted.\nPlus, why the random toxic masculinity out of the main character? You immediately knew he was going to say or do something cringy when he ramped up the fake Jersey accent.\n\nAnd then the ending battle sequence... WHERE THE F- DID THE VILLAGE ARMY JUST DISAPPEAR TO!??! Seriously. They're fighting and the fight's not over and they're winning and then *poof* they're just gone and there's no one there but the family and BBEG.\nAnd why did Spider save the BBEG at the end? Like WHHYYY!???\nThere's more... This movie was so bad. I can't believe it's getting the press that it's getting.",

There appears to be such a sentiment against any \"franchise\" film, or \"blockbuster\". Wasn't the whole idea at one time to go to the movies to be entertained. To be \"taken away\" and escape. Sure, lash out at the countless awful, poorly thought-out films that are nothing but a dispassionate cash-grab. Those movies where the few best lines, or best action sequences have to be put into the trailer, just to get you in the door and empty your pocket.\n\nAvatar: The Way of Water, is no such ruse. The movie is simply stunning in its detail and ability to take the viewer to literally another world. Not since I was 13, and saw Star Wars in 1977, have I been so amazed by what I saw on a screen. The movie is as transformative as that blockbuster, and will again reset the bar for how movies will be made. There is a richness, and reality to James Cameron's world that simply has to be seen. It cannot translate the same way on your 60 inch TV on a streaming service. The story is relevant and worth telling thought the lens of this far-away world. Sure, the narrative has been told, like any story, in some form previously. \"Dances with Wolves\" was a masterpiece. But plenty of people have not seen that story from 30 years ago. Avatar certainly borrows similar ideas. But wow, what a way to remaster an important story. I didn't have a sense of time during this film. I couldn't believe that the 3 hr 12 min ride had expired. The technology and ability to but the viewer into the ocean - phenomenal. The years of work and passion on this film show. The acting and cast is excellent. The direction, honestly hard to conceive of the vision James had to pull this off. When you understand that all of the underwater scenes where actually captured underwater so that the motion you see is real. It makes sense why this world is so absolutely convincing. You will never fall for another actor hanging on wires (Aquaman) pretending to be underwater in a movie. This is $12 WELL spent. It has been a long time since I have gone back to watch a film a second time in the theater (and it was a Cameron film). See it in IMAX 3D, you will not regret it.",

Instead he goes at it alone with Neytiri, which allows the soldiers to get away and prolongs the conflict.\n\n The entire premise of the movie is also baffling as Jake decides to leave his tribe who he spent the entire first movie fighting beside and instead brings war and suffering to peaceful communities who get put to the torch for this one man. The fact that Jake is being put first over entire communities of peaceful people is very upsetting to watch.

I felt like the story was recycled from the first movie and if it was given as much thought as the CGI and visuals, it would have been a top-tier movie.\n\nI do realize that the whole meaning of the film is to show how bad humanity can be and how we can steal culture and colonize lands, but there should still be structure in the story and more thought to the indigenous culture.",

Whether this may have been your intention or not, the criticisms have already been made and it may be in your best interest to try and avoid the recurrence of these critiques moving forward. While the story of the Navi people is not necessarily Indigenous as they are about a group of alien beings who simply do not exist, there are many influences that are apparent in their nature.

Even with the film's 3-hour runtime, it is clear how much effort he, the cast, and the studio poured in to making the film a reality. While Cameron did strive for maximum authenticity, however, my critique would lie in his representation of other cultures. Even though Pandora is a made-up world, the Polynesian cultures that he pulls from to make the Water Na'vi people can be seen as inauthentic, or even appropriated by some. Given that the writing team had very little representation of those with a Polynesian/Pacific background, it can give the film a skewed view of a very rich, diverse culture. Although the film is still fantasy at the end of the day, I believe that Avatar 2 would have been greatly enhanced if the story was told through the eyes of Pacific writers and crew members, rather than from an outsider's view.",

After watching it myself, I noticed many positives and negatives of indigenous culture in your film. One thing I do admire about this film is recognizing that people overthrowing the indigenous land, life, and world is bad and that these things are wrong. I think recognizing that in today's day and age is very important and it is good to see that on the big screen. However along with that I notice the flip side that many people see that you pick and choose what you want to use to make your story. Many, including myself, see some of these things as very in-genuine and feel that when you pick and choose, you do so for economic benefit rather than maintaining the dignity of indigenous people and their culture.

The issues presented are that there is not enough credit given to a specific indigenous culture that you used inspiration from but by my thinking I quite like the way you've laid out the imagery of both Avatar movies. Avatar one presents the visual representation of a white culture exploring the native culture and experiencing what it means to open the way you thought more with the feeling of invasion by the native people. \nExploring Avatar the way of water was more a native invasion of native, showing the difference in cultures and not just mashing together the idea that all indigenous people are under one umbrella. The different Avatar people have different actions and different beliefs that account for where they are located while also having the same base built on the way we act as people toward nature. It is true that your portrayal of the different cultures could have done with a bit more creative direction from inside one specific culture instead of adding many to one area for a place that is said not to have ventured away or have experienced outsiders before. The use of more indigenous actors could easily make this concept flow easier while still allowing for the merge of behaviors.",

I could almost feel the wing blowing on my face when Jack and Natiri glided through the air. I want to touch every interesting plant when the night falls and see the neon glow they have. I also want to have my own Avatar body and live in the giant home tree and maybe tame my first banshee. Here we are at the end of 2022, watching The Way of Water.

To begin with the pros, I appreciate that you took the effort to hire a linguistics professor to create your own language for your fictional tribe. I believe if you had chosen to use an already existing language you would have faced even more backlash from the native community. I also believe your breakthroughs with CGI are incredible. While the storyline of the second film may not have been as strong as the first, I can recognize your advances in technology. Some critics I must include your casting. It was honestly quite shocking to me to find out that the voice actors of Jake Sully's sons were white. Especially considering the heavy accents they both had. I also believe you could have hired more skilled voice actors for the children considering none of them had the same accent despite growing up together in the same tribe. It was very disappointing to me that you could not take the initiative to hire native people as your voice actors, especially due to the sheer amount of their culture you incorporated into your film. Another issue I had with your development process was the fact you barely had any native consultants on this film. As I am sure you are aware, you are a white man with no experience of native culture whatsoever. And yet you decided to take customs from many different cultures and mix them together and play it off as though it's fictional to make yourself sound better. Not only did you take these customs for your film, but you also portrayed them wrongly which is quite embarrassing for you. I believe someone with as many resources as yourself should be able to find consultants to ensure you were at least portraying these cultures in a correct manner. But I do give you credit for the storyline. It is a great concept for a film; however, I wish there were other people on your team that could have ensured this movie will be great. Disregarding the cultural aspect, the first movie was by far better. I noticed a lot in the second film that you touched on subjects that were very important but then never discussed them again. For instance, Kiri has a seizure underwater and almost dies because she asked her mom's spirit who her dad was. That was a major scene in the movie and yet the audience was made to forget about it later. I understand you will be touching on these topics later in the sequels, but it almost made no sense to bring them up now. Especially since your entire trailer began with Kiri talking about how she can hear and feel her mom's heartbeat. And yet for this film specifically that had no strong importance. It was misleading, and I believe that's why a lot of people were confused or disappointed with the actual storyline. Another issue I have with Kiri's character is the fact you reused Grace's voice actor. It made Kiri's character feel much less authentic because an old woman's voice was coming out of a child's body. It just made no sense, and it made me not enjoy the character. Was it really that difficult to find a teenage girl to fill the role? The voice actor did not even try to sound younger.

Yes the movie seems to have a simple predictable plot but it's just the 1st and 2nd act of the sequel, I think they are smart enough to plan room for Pandora world introduction instead of making the storytelling packed with twist and turns just to satisfy the common stereotype of those fast-paced action blockbusters. The creation of Pandora is mesmerizing and surreal yet so relevant to Earth's nature and wildlife that I really appreciate James' creativity and his long term dedication to the concept and biological coherence of the world. Beside that, the characters' depth are good and invested, the emotions are real and touching especially with Zoe's and Kate's characters. If I have to compare with recent years' formula blockbusters, Avatar is totally another level of film making and entertainment. It's been such a long time that I feel like I can enjoy a blockbuster to the fullest, if we don't count Dennis's works cuz to me he has very different vibe and stylized works.",

            "content": "James Cameron's \"Avatar: the Way of Water\" is an ambitious, thoughtful and suspenseful science-fiction blockbuster suggesting that filmmaking is an indispensable tool for raising awareness about global warming. With sequel, Cameron employs sci-fi spectacle to shed light on importance of building a modern-day universe that is sustainable. It's the filmmaker's first attempt to honor ecosystems in a genre world-famous for escapism rather than environmental activism, but he pulls it off successfully. Using spellbinding cinematography, Cameron immerses viewers into the world of Pandora where the ecosystem is valued rather than looked upon with stigma as in America. Evoking James Cameron's \"Titanic\", Cameron effectively uses the ocean to showcase the shipwreck repercussions of environmental destruction. Recalling Jack & Rose's maiden voyage journey on Titanic ships doomed to sinking tragedy, Jake Sully must learn to survive on oceans to save family. If \"Avatar\" took place entirely upon the confined planet of Pandora showcasing its lush rainforests, the sequel captures devastation done to the world's oceans. Cameron shows immense control over production-design, editing and music, crafting an unforgettable cinematic experience. Cameron's screenplay is also sensational, using subtle water symbolism to celebrate the world's ecosystem. One appreciates astonishing performances. Sam Worthington delivers one of his greatest career performances as Jake Sully. It isn't simple to communicate emotions underneath motion-capture makeup, but Sam succeeds tremendously. With riveting expression, he conveys bravery, determination and regrets of a protective father that strives to protect his family from environmental catastrophe. Although facial expressions of the supporting actors are hidden beneath mo-cap makeup, they excel at portraying their characters. From a technical standpoint, the film shows how far visual effects have progressed since 2009 with jaw-dropping motion-capture performances which are on par with Andy Serkis' \"Planet of the Apes\" trilogy. Although \"The Way of Water\" is a superb sequel, ultimately it can't quite capture the sense of wonder of its superior predecessor. At three hours, it suffers from a lengthy running time that tests viewers' patience. Moreover, it builds to a conventional ending that appears intended solely to setup future sequels. Nevertheless, fans of the sci-fi genre will definitely appreciate \"Avatar: The Way of Water\" and so will movie-goers seeking enjoyable entertainment. If Cinema is an art-form with the power to change attitudes towards the environment in America during the modern era, hopefully revisiting the fantastical world of Pandora in the sci-fi genre will encourage the general public to recognize the undeniable existence of climate change in a country torn apart by environmental stigma where the destinies of natural ecosystems all-too-often lie in the hands of greedy politicians elected based upon their charisma rather than talents that are driven by a political agenda.",

The plot of The Way Of Water is so watery I am not even going to apologize for the overly obvious nature of my pun.\n\nThis story, it's so silly, I don't even... Well, sea (ha-ha) for yourselves: so the \"Earth baddies\" return to Pandora to get Sully for treason. Sure, they let slip somewhere that they also want to do some colonizing and terraforming, but seeing that in all the 14 hours of screen time they did exactly none of that, the whole colonization thing must be just a side quest to them. Somehow Sully realizes that all the hubbub is about him personally, so he says to his wife and kids \"Hey, I got a great idea, since these angry earth dudes are after me, our presence here in this village is endangering the other other villagers, so let's all up and leave, and run and hide, and this way we shall PROTECT the village!\"\n\nAnd guess what, his suddenly spineless wife, instead of shaming her sweetheart Toruk-Makto into calling the banners on all the tribes that he'd supposedly \"unified\", after a moment's hesitation she says \"Sure, that's a splendid idea, I fully endorse it, let's do it at once.\" And they pack up out of there and leave their kindred behind for the earth baddies to stomp (because, remember - they are still colonizing the heck out of Pandora no matter what). The Sacred Tree, the ancestors' graves, their relatives who are about to get massacred: everything is abandoned -- we're running, babe! He was the Chief of the tribe, too, mind. \n\n\"When danger reared its ugly head\nHe bravely tucked his tail and fled\nBrave, brave, brave \nSir Toruk-Makto!\"\n\nSo they go and instead of settling on some distant uninhabited island where no one can find them, they join another village, so they can endanger THEM with their presence instead, which is what ultimately happens. Of course, duh!\n\nAfter about a week-and-a-half of screen time of us watching them bond with the locals (who happen to speak Sully's tribe's language, how convenient, eh) and frolic in the waves and do synchronized swimming with sea-turtles and whales, the bad humans naturally catch up with Sully in his new tribe and turn everyone's life to sh*t.  But instead of feeling an e-e-e-tsy bit annoyed with Sully's family for bringing the war with them, the water tribe is like \"Yay, what joy! You are now our BRETHREN! In fact, we are so pleased with you, why don't you stay with us forever? Here's our underwater Sacred Tree, go pigtail-copulate with it to complete the ritual!\" \n\nAND THEY DO. \n\nTHE END.\n\nYes, that is the story.",

How were the able to hunt there for so long and not be a target for Jake or the other tribes. Why would the smart magical daughter take the toddler with them knowing they would most likely run into a fight for them to get hurt or captured. Another thing is the writing. It's just so bland and made me cringe so God damn much. When this gets released everything they say bro or cuz I'll take a drink and be hospitalized a quarter way through the movie. On to the villains. In the first movie it was a battle for Jake to choose between saving the humans or the Na'Vi. This made the humans the villains that you could still understand and relate too. This time the humans have made Na'Vi clones of the first evil humans and instead of having them be relatable in anyway (unless you relate to manhunting for the sake of manhunting) they are just evil. Also why did Jake and his wife run from them when they had maybe 7-10 Na'Vi soldiers max and the 2 of them took out all of them, half in the first encounter. They already couldn't be found and they were winning this Gorilla war so there was absolutely no reason for Jake to take his family and run. Anyway just a meh movie that is way too long with meh writing, meh plot, and breathtaking visuals.",

The beauty and the time James Cameron took for the first movie, showing the world of wonders, can not be matched in its sequel.\n\nEven there are some moments where you see its beauty shine through the thick heavy fighting scenes, they do not amaze as in its predecessor.\nThe movie is a blend of a try-it-all, the dialogues feel forced, the storyline is thin, the acting not flawless, and above all misses the heart and soul of the characters.  Was James Sully a hero in the first, in the sequel he feels overshadowed by his younger son. Clich\u00e9's on clich\u00e9's pass the revenue. For example the sea girl and the son of sully who is struck by lightning when seeing her, falling in love immediatly, but as Sully would say fittingly about this \"Sully's stick together\"\u2026 Where have I heard that sentence before\u2026\n\nWith more than three hours you you feel moments you just wish the movie was going to bring something spectaculair and daring. For a brief moment there is the beautiful friendship of Tuljun Payakan (the sort of whale). This should have been a focus point of the movie. The developing friendship within him and Sully's son is beautiful.\nBut after this the movie just goes all directions and (spoiler alert), when the eldest son dies, you feel not the grief or sadness you should (as with the ancient tree that was knocked down). Sigourney Weaver lays all movie in a casket, even she is voicing the daughter who is a teenager and sounds like an older female. Tuk the youngest daughter is just annoying and shouldn't have made the final draft of the script at all.\n\nAll but all, the movie is okey to watch if you don't care about stories, arcs, character backgrounds or development, nor their emotions, and you like fighting and action, this movie is for you to watch.\n\nBut sadly the movie doesn't reach the highlights as in the first, and that's a pity. Especially thinking how much the costs were. With many Avatar movies to come, I wonder where it all will go and how much Pandora can take before it becomes like the Disney prequels and sequels nobody even remembers.",

            "content": "I actually held off watching this movie until last night for one simple reason:  the original Avatar was so good, in my opinion, that I didn't see any way for Cameron to create anything that captured the awe and magic of the first movie.  I mean, the original was so groundbreaking.  It was so immersive, beautiful, and engaging in practically every way.  It's hard to find movies with so much CGI in it where you completely suspend your disbelief and are wholly invested in the story as it plays out.  Plus, we all remember the Jurassic Park sequels: they had a really hard time feeling fresh and different from the initial movie that made us stare in wonder at a world with dinosaurs.  I feared the same fate for this sequel, and I didn't want the first movie ruined for me.\n\nBut Avatar: The Way of Water blew all of my expectations out of the water!  It builds upon the existing world of Avatar and none of it feels stale!  It still feels like \"Avatar\"...but MORE.  I loved it!\n\nI worried about the introduction of children into the story (I don't think that's a spoiler because the previews show it) because it can be hard to get invested in CGI characters because we're kinda hard-wired to relate to other humans.  In the original movie, we were introduced to Sully as a human, so we related to him a little easier, I think.  For me, I found myself having a hard time getting emotionally invested in the CGI children.  There's one human \"child\" (he's a young adult and not really a \"child\", but...) and I found myself aligning more closely to him instead of Jake's kids.  But I didn't necessarily mind that too much and it wasn't a big distraction...and I DID end up investing somewhat in those characters, but it definitely took a little time.  It didn't help that the kids all looked the same.\n\nBut don't let that deter you from watching this movie!  I was expecting some degree of disappointment and went to the theater expecting to pick it apart and find something wrong with it.  In retrospect, I should've just enjoyed it the ride...and you should too!",

            "content": "James Cameron makes a triumphant return with the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 box office hit, Avatar. The biggest problem this film faced was the significant time jump between release dates, however, Cameron managed to maneuver around this, creating a captivating story that left plenty of room for further developments. Unlike the first film, this one focused heavily on emotions and familial relationships. It created the bond that so many of us long for when it comes to friends and family, and it made the events of the film a little more harrowing as they established very quickly that nobody is safe. Much like the first film, this one continued the storyline of environmentalism and colonization, effectively putting the audience in a place that has them rooting on the side of the Na'vi \u2013 and against their own people. \n\nIn order to tell this story in the manner that was intended, Cameron waited until he had the technology available to create an immersive world for his audience. Especially with the use of IMAX and 3D effects, the viewer can feel transported to Pandora for the full length of the film, and will grow to miss this universe when the credits roll and the screen fades to black. The CGI for this film was masterful in every way and it can be difficult to find a cast that possesses the talent to perform with the technology that will assist in building this world. That being said, casting director, Margery Simkin, could not have done a better job. While the entire cast provided wonderful performances, Zoe Saldana (Neytiri) stood out with her emotional performance as not only a warrior, but a mother and wife as well. It was refreshing to see that, although she has different priorities now, she still held on to her values and beliefs in the same manner as the first film. \n\nThe only thing that I felt this film lacked was a memorable soundtrack, as it seemed to blend in to the background of the film and was not as noticeable to me. However, this is not always a bad thing. It was still an important aspect in creating the desired atmosphere, and it did not overshadow the incredible action sequences that appeared throughout the entire film. \n\nWith perfect pacing on a three-hour story that left me wanting more, it comes as no surprise that this film is quickly approaching the coveted $2 billion box office mark that very few films have seen \u2013 one of those being its predecessor, and another being Titanic (1997), all with the same director. Whether you are a fan of the franchise, director, actors, or just mildly interested in the story, I recommend seeing this film in theaters as it is a heartwarming and thought-provoking experience that is sure to make you excited for the third film.",

I think sacrificing a film even in the slightest for the sake of what could possibly come next its a huge disservice the the saga as a whole. Don't ask such big questions without delivering slightest bit of an answer.\n\nThough overall, I really liked this sequel.

Fights are drawn out so long and with so much repetition, that even the characters chime in on this absurd fact,  saying thing like\" I can not believe I am tied up again\". Yes indeed,  neither can we. We also can not believe, that the villain form the last movie has to be killed again. Avatar1 , in addition to being visually overwhelming for the time it was made in, had charming characters, and a very captivating story. Avatar 2 does not even manage to get you interested in a single Character. The only person whom I found even remotely likeable, was a Biologist, who shortly appears aboard a sort of whale hunting vessel. He has nothing o do with the rest of the story at all.  Surprisingly the CGI has remained exactly the same, even though 14 years have past. The main Characters have gotten an entire litter of children neither of whom gets any character development. You do not actually get to know them and  they all look alike anyway. The only name of a child that I can even remember is Kitty, simply because it was such a ridiculous name for a blue alien child. Instead of focusing on the interesting nature of the alien Planet or, for that matter, a story,  this movie focuses on endless repetitive fighting scenes and the annoying and rather boring revenge lust of the villain form avatar1. The main character  Sully treats his own kids like a shitty patriarch overlord, constantly blaming them for something, while repeating the same line, that protecting his family gives a father purpose. We jump back and forth in-between petty juvenile pranks, endless fighting scenes and yoga like breathing exercises. We are supposed to feel for the absurd amount of nameless kids, because occasionally they feel like they do not completely fit in. Oh my. One time kitty seems to have special powers with sea animals, but she never really uses them for anything interesting. The entire row behind me was asleep by the end of the second hour.  I rate this the second most boring movie I have ever seen.",

You'd want them to have a real debate and try to convince on another.

I feel like my eyes are being closed off and I can't see around me. Like I have blinders on. Seeing a huge IMAX screen feels more immersive to me.. but I'm getting off track.\n\nTo me this really felt like a redo of the first movie. I did appreciate the extra work they put in the further develop the relationships and to give the kids some personality. But the story still felt pretty flat, predicable, and tired to me. A mostly re-telling of the story from the first movie. I had hoped for more on the story and script side. I was disappointed there.\n\nThe actors all seemed to do a good job and they were compelling. I think Zoe Saldana really was better than most of the other actors she was working with.\n\nOverall I was disappointed and had expected more from the story and the experience on a personal level. From what I read about all the work they did on the script.. I had hoped it would have done more with it. The reasons that all the fighting was going on.. just didn't seem motivated or make much sense. The movie just wanted action and fighting it seems. Oh well.",

Literally diving you head first into the Way of Water! My expressions would of been interesting to record as my imagination literally went wild discovering these new creatures, water plants, sea animals and so much more! The new characters were interesting I particularly liked the character Kiri but for some reason I didn't connect with her facial features in comparison to Neytiri who is obviously every woman's favorite character! Spider played a good character as well but I wanted to hear more from him. He didn't speak much through out the movie. The new water characters were beautiful and creative! After I leave this review I will head down a rabbit hole to learn all of the new character names and who played each one! The whale creature and the connection with the younger son was amazing! I really love the fact that they are relaying a message to the world\"let's take care of Mother Nature\".

Over all very well done! The emotions the movie brought to the table and the visual effects will have me catching this film in Dolby, IMAX 3D, then repeat! Superb job as always James Cameron!",

I will say I did not like the actor who played spider though, only because I felt his emotions weren't enough, and he mostly just sat and watched the others fight, but I get it because he is still a young actor and I hope to see how much he grows from now till avatar 3",

I actually love that actress but it just didn't seem to fit right. The second thing was the very pregnant woman fighting with the warriors. I know that women are warriors in this world too and I like that. It makes the story more interesting, but I challenge anyone to find any culture ever that would allow that to happen.

You can put a billion dollars in their eyes, but they hear Dollar Store in their ears.\n\nIf you need monster roars, go to a zoo, record animals, slow it down, down pitch it, layer it with other animals, reverse it if need be, and get your fattest intern to clean his sinuses over a tin bucket to get the BEAST FROM PLANET X or THE GORGON OF THE 7TH ABYSS or EXPERIMENT IIX FROM LABORATORY XII.\n\nSame goes for music. Take an extra 2 months before release for post so that an orchestra can COMPOSE to the edit of the film you decided on. GET RID of all the temp tracks you can (Because everything has sounded like Hans Zimmer for the last 25 years it feels like). Maybe try some Beethoven, Mozart, Orf, Rachmaninov, or other composers for inspiration? YEAH, you are mostly making action movies, but your big BUM DUM BUM DUM timpanni and French Horn can STILL sound badass with violins and trumpets.\nAlways trying for a Christopher Nolan Tuba Fart for trailers or a Spiderman style faster little heartbeat sound for action scenes IS DULL. AND IF NO ONE IS COMPLAINING, THAT IS BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW BETTER AFTER 25 years!!!\n\nListen to the soundtrack to Conan the Barbarian, A Lion in Winter, or Lawrence of Arabia. Take it in! You can have ninjas from space over that stuff, if you must be modern and thrilling. Heck, imagine Darth Vader with the theme for Lion in Winter behind him in a scene. The audience will flip out with joy at that OOOMF in the sound without even changing the tempo.",

I would not recommend for a 3 hour action movie, if at all. It lost most of the thrill before the opening trailers were done.  The novelty was totally gone by the first 30 minutes. The seats shook so much that our drinks went flat. It was really funny to see people who bought big buckets of popcorn.  Trying to keep it from flying out of the bucket. 4DX tickets were twice as much as the normal price and it was not a great experience.",

They used slang and American language in the Avatar culture. They also used American cultural norms in a totally different culture. An example was the way the son was disciplined for not listening to his father and how the father ran his family like an army. The cursing was pretty culturally off as well.  The fighting went on way too long. I got very bored with it. Could have taken 1/2 hr or more off the movie.  \nThe underwater scenes were wonderful. Could have been more of that. \nI still liked the movie but if there is a sequel will have to be done much better to keep me coming back.",

I remember Jake and the fam having to flee the tribe because the humans came back and.. the tribe got attacked? no it didn't..? then there was this plot with a whale and one of the kids and... what were the names of the kids again? \n\nI know it is a great movie, and the visuals are possibly the best ever set to screen but i cannot give this higher than 3.5, i am sorry. \n\nAnnother point i wanna make is that the 60fps scenes really do distract, that's about it.",

Needless to say, I believe the praise is warranted. Avatar: The Way of Water is a beautifully shot, directed, and yes even written film. The movie has stunning visuals that will leave you breathless especially if you see it on the largest screen and in 3D. The movie also has beautiful performances from its entire cast with the character of Kiri in my opinion being the real heart of the movie. The film even has very touching moments with even one scene truthfully leaving me a little choked up. If you are still on the fence of seeing the film, I strongly suggest you check it out while it's still and it's theatrical run. You will not regret sitting through this 3-hour epic!",

Unfortunately, one pretty large issue with the movie is the rapid introduction of random pieces of information and the leaving open of enormous plot holes (intended to set the stage for the next movies). From the survival of\u00a0all of the villains to the question of Kiri's father's identity, so much was left so\u00a0completely up in the air that viewers were left unsatisfied with the conclusion. Additionally, the introduction of certain pieces of information ring of deus ex machinas, which have no place in sci-fi cinema.

The runtime of the movie is long, not unbearably long though as the visual treat is mesmerising enough to ground a viewer; it's ironic that with the lengthy runtime, avatar 2 still feels rushed. \n\nThe story is thin and the dialogue is poor (the constant use of 'Bro' from the young actors was cringe worthy, and gives off a poor image of what old people think young people sound like); Avatar 2 is heavily centred on family, but even this isn't portrayed properly. Various subplots are raised and tossed carelessly, while the main plot is also rushed through just to get to the big finish. The characters aren't well fleshed or developed properly; some characters are borderline unnecessary.\n\nThe action scenes are grand and well choreographed, and the final act is heavily influenced by Titanic (a movie also made by James Cameron).\n\nIn all, Avatar 2 is a visual spectacle with a relatively thin plot that lacks poignancy.",

            "content": "As I entered the cinema to watch this movie I must admit I had my doubts, 13 years since Avatar had released, I was worried that this movie would have issues bringing me back into the world of Pandora, however I can safely say that the movie had succeeded. \n\nThe movie begins in the same time period as the last one, and it feels like reuniting with old friends, Jake Sully, Neytiri, the good RDA scientists (I forget their names), but we are shown a montage of the years as they pass, which I believe is about 13 years, so you feel as though the world has caught up with you the viewer, and the Sully family has grown, they have children, but their lives are surrounded by a constant war against the RDA, ever intent on poaching more resources and land from their planet. However Jake makes the decision to flee the region, and go into hiding with his family, to the tropical region of Pandora, where a new type of Na'vi reside.\n\nThe characters are all their own, Jake and Neytiri are more mature, having raised a family, but their children are the highlight, in fact a majority of the story surrounds them, and their struggles fitting into a new society of Na'vi, however what's great is how Jakes children all have their unique personalities, one is more headstrong, one is more gentle and timid, but then you have his youngest daughter, Tuk, who never failed to make the theatre laugh during her comedic moments.\n\nVisually this movie is breathtaking, the last movie having released in 2009 was stunning to say the least, but this movie elevates the visuals by bringing forth such a distinct sense of colour and vibrancy. The introduction of a new region to Pandora, a more seaside, tropical ocean landscape, surrounded by islands, rocky landscapes, and a sweeping ocean to boot, there is so much eye candy that your visuals may develop cavities. Cameron has made an effort to flesh out the world of Pandora by introducing a new species of Na'vi, an aquatic type that mainly relies on the ocean and it's species to travel. I love how these Na'vi are different, they possess bigger hands, that are more akin to fins, their culture is slightly different to their Omatikaya clan, and from what's been said about the third instalment by Cameron, I'm glad more is being done to flesh out the world even more, it really makes it all the more believable as a fictional world.\n\nThe score was composed by Simon Franglen for this instalment, as he replaced James Horner who as we all know tragically lost his life in 2015. However, Franglen nailed it, the music is soaring, it gives this sense of weightlessness, yet it also envelops you with a feeling of wonder, a desire to view the unknown, funnily enough, how the ocean is. There is also a track done by The Weeknd, which plays at the credits (I particularly loved his song for Black Panther, and I'm quite a fan of his music so I may be a little biased here but it is a fantastic track)\n\nThere are some aspects of the story I feel left me feeling a little underwhelmed sadly, some storylines were left unresolved, and I felt that for a movie that runs for just over 3 hours, there was little seen of some characters such as Neytiri and Kiri (Funny story, but for the entire movie I thought her name was Kitty, and apparently a lot of people thought the same, until I saw it's actually Kiri, so that happened). Nevertheless, I believe the reason why some questions have been left unanswered is simply because it will most likely come up in the next instalment. So, all that's left to do is wait for that, and hope we don't have to wait another 13 years!\n\nSo the simple question is this, would I recommend this movie? Yes I would. It's enjoyable, its visually appealing, and there's a good blend of action scenes with more mellow, intimate scenes that overall combine to provide an enjoyable watch that'll certainly entertain.",

While the visual effects will have you in awe and the script invests a lot of time into expanding the internal lore of Pandora and the Na'vi, the characters that inhabit that world are not particularly interesting. James Cameron makes an effort to develop his protagonists, he is so preoccupied with worldbuilding, that the heroes are overshadowed by the scenery. We get a love story, that does not really go anywhere. Jake's adopted daughter, Kiri who possesses special powers tries to learn more about her past, but her quest proves fruitless. We don't even get a partial answer as to why she is different. I guess that will be explained in the sequel....  The action scenes are of plenty, but none of them will hold you in suspense. The sense of danger is practically non-existent as, despite the state of the art tech at their disposal, the human villains are no match for the Na'vi warriors and are easily ambushed by them. Once again, Cameron uses heartless, incompetent military types, who brutalise the innocent and use and torture to achieve their goals as the antagonists of his picture. I am tired of seeing these kind of characters being used as an excuse for evil in films.",

You might argue they didnt have the time. But hey they wasted the first 30 minutes in showing beautful pictures. \nAnyways besides this the movie is quite watchable with some narrative issues. First and formost . The Story tries to gereate empathy for creatrues which werent even introduced porperly. Like this whale type of creature which dies and then they are all very upset and sad and what a beautful songwriter this whale was. Wait what?\nSomething went wrong here but okay. \nThen there are glimpses of other relationships they try to picture like between father and son and other topics like racism but all very short and shallow. \nI could say there was not really the time for deep introducing and personbuilding but hey we got three bad guys here , none of which was properly explained what they are doing and why. The female general wich was one of them disappears compleatly for some reason and spoiler alert the main motivation of the male general is revenge wait whaat?`Ok, I wonder what the next movies are going to look like, but this was not a worthy sequal.",

It's true that it has not got much of a meaning or character development but I think this is an unfair criticism as it's a CGI alien movie, it was never meant to have vast character development or a deeper meaning. Avatar is an action film and it's not trying or should try to have deep themes and meanings.

Only I had miss some if the movie  to come ask about ny order.  I ended up having to make three trips to bring it to my family. The second employee was outstanding! Very polite kind and considerate! I was allowed me to order food from the restaurant and pay cash because that they way I prefer to pay as I brought cash for the occasion. I will return and I am understanding of the first employee but it still wasn't unpleasant to have to explain to my son when he asked why she was rude and why he could not get dinner. I had to spend extra money on popcorn when we wanted food from the restaurant. We end up wasting half the popcorn because we got out fiis from the restaurant delivered to us asap and was full off that. However the theater and movie was great. My family  and I had a good time.

It seemed as if the template of the first movie was copy-pasted. In addition, the story hasn't been made extensive enough to answer the questions which the audience had been posed with. For example; we never find out why Kiri had unique abilities which connected her to Eywa. To mention additionally, the plot of the story has showed a scene with the mother; not revealing the identity of the father; leaving many questions about Kiri\u2018s origin story unanswered.

Oh, and the dead villain from the last movie has been saved on disk and downloaded into an avatar body--along with his entire squad--with the sole mission of hunting and killing Sully--because having to create a WHOLE NEW villain would've been too much work apparently.  Nevermind that the Avatar bodies are so absurdly expensive that its the reason they used Jake Sully to begin with.  They can apparently just develop them willy-nilly now.  Remember, Cameron ONLY had 13 years to work on this.  Not only is the villain resurrected, but turns out he had a SON--Feral Justin Bieber--but he's actually sided with the Smurf people.

The biggest one you have to ignore as the main \"story\" gets going is: Why did the main characters think the villains would stop hurting the rest the Na'vi tribe if they left??? Did they send a letter to the bad guy saying \"Hey! Quit killing our people because we're not there anymore. We left to go far away and they have not idea where we are anymore.\" Later in the movie, when the bad guys showed up looking for the Sully clan, they didn't take \"We don't know where they are\" as an answer, but they'd accept and walk away from the people they lived with for over a decade?\n\nBTW, why were the avatars for the bad guys grown, or stored, all the way back on Earth? It seemed like the avatars in the first movie were grown, or at the very least, stored in the main base on Pandora? Made no sense, but on that point I could've been wrong.\n\nEven if you ignore that, the rest of the story seemed like a rehash of most of the first movie but with water instead of trees, and instead of a tribe resembling Native Americans, it's a tribe based on Pacific Islanders (yet the queen is voiced by Kate Winslet...the whitest of white people. HA!!!). I heard a rumor that one of the sequels will take place in desert type lands. Can't wait to meet the Na'vi with the Middle Eastern accents and culture since Cameron can't make up any original aliens. There were no surprises. You could see pretty much every turn, plot point and event coming a mile away. Except the talking whales. That caught me off guard when it turned out they understood sign language and communicated in a way that the water people and Scully clan could understand. Also, who tattoos whales?\n\nIn then end, it was 3+ hours of pretty pictures as long as you shut off your brain when it came to the story itself...not unlike the first movie and I bet the sequels will be the same. Still, I love the visuals and will probably still give Disney and Cameron my money to see them on the big screen too.",

I don't think people would actually be saying these phrases in a time when travel to other planets is possible.\nOn that note, I was taken aback by the number of new and shiny weapons of war/pillaging were introduced and it made me ponder the following: how could the people of a planet that was dying have the resources to create such amazing tech, and not be able to save the planet. But then, I've answered my own question. That's EXACTLY how it will be when we get to that point. It's our nature.\nLike the original, the \"sky people\" (short of a few scientists) are driven by greed. A sign of things to come, I'm afraid. And we won't have a Pandora.",

Makes sense indeed. So many plot points make no sense or are pourely written that it kept me from being fully invested. \n\nThere's a human character here that keep switching sides here and there. It could have been a good plot point but it isn't. The father-son relationship here should have been a bigger focus.\n\nTalking about father-son, the son of the main character Jake Sully is such a 2000's teenager. The amount of \"yeaaah brooo\" \"daaamn dude\" he says during the film just sounds so weird. Wasn't he raised by a soldier? Is there internet with an access to earth's socialmedia plateforms on Pandora?? Maybe the writters wanted to appeal to a younger audience, but it doesn't make anysense here.\n\nThe whale chase scene, was really really good. It was disturbing as hell, but that was definitely the point of the film and it was extremely effective. You really end up hating the living hell of the humans in this film. Wich is both a good and a bad thing in my opinion. I think Cameron focused to much on the humans with bad intentions here and didn't have enought good humans. The 1st movie had this duality in mentality and it was definitely a strong part of the movie.\n\nIt's not a bad movie... it's just not good eother in my opinion. But I am glad I saw it in IMAX.

And the avatar's don't convey the same level of emotion as the humans, Sam Worthington is a great actor, you realize the impact of him not appearing as a human.  \nOn the liked side the story is very good, a great 2nd edition, not as good as the first movie but the underwater environment adds newness and wonder to equal the first movie.  Watched yesterday in IMAX and would like to go back again and watch in IMAX.  Definitely worth two or more views in the theatre. I would give the first movie 5 stars and this one 4.5 stars but because I can't do 4.5 I'll do 5 again.  One of the greatest errors in Academy Awards is that this first movie did not win best picture.  Glad to see James Cameron is scoring such a big hit.",

While I was able to identify that I was watching a fairly stock scene (e.g., the \"hero at their lowest point gathers their courage and fights back\" scene), those scenes did what they were suppose to effectively.  I was sad when a blue cat person died and I felt triumphant when an alien whale thing got revenge.  There were setups and payoffs and brief, efficient visual metaphors. Avatar demonstrated that James Cameron has strong directing fundamentals, even when directing a film that was probably 99.9% CGI.\n\nThe CGI itself was truly top of the line, and the movie is probably worth watching for the CGI alone.

And i'm Sure, that James Cameron will develope the main Characters from part 1, but they were perfectly introduced in the first Avatar.\nBut what bothers me, is the other storyline in this Movie. The Enemy in this Film is also Quadritch. And they could have made a greater Villain than in Part one. Because now he has a personal motivation to kill Jake. But in the beginning they made jokes with him and later in the Film, he did some terrible things, thinking of this Water riding Animal, that he killed, and that doesn't fit together, which I have an issue with. What I also didn't like was that Quadritch had to do every step, that Jake did in the first Avatar. And also what they did with Spider, quadritchs son because there was so much potential in it.\nBut all in all it's a Emotional, INCREDIBLE looking Film.",

Early in this movie, they tell us it's really about taking over the planet and making it the new earth. But instead of concentrating on taking over the planet, they decide they need to kill one of the characters from the previous movie. Killing him has no effect on whether or not humans take over the plant or not but all resources from the humans and military efforts are focused on killing this guy. It's nonsensical. Then we discover later on that it's really about harvesting a substance from one of the sea creatures. A substance that stops aging.

I've never actually seen the first Avatar, (Being partial to District 9, which I think is a much better 2009 alien movie) I thought that it showed what happened in the first movie without actually explaining it in a great way. The problem is, in almost three-and-a-half hours, it seems to accomplish next to nothing. There's romance, friendship, intrigue, and family building, but it's shallow and seemingly random, as if James Cameron wanted to show off his CGI skills and throw in random plotlines in between, half of which are completely abandoned. For example, Kiri's connection to Pandora itself, like, what happened there?! She summoned some glowing stuff! I'd compare this to Arya Stark in GOT, where she spends so much time developing her powers only to use them once. Another thing is the older brother. (Neteyam or whatever his name is, see? I can't remember it!) He gets NO plotline and just dies for the fun of it! If he had an actual personality we would have cared! It also has no LGBTQ+ representation, like this is 2023, we should have this in mainstream movies already. I think that Avatar: The Way of Water is a visually stunning movie, but needs work on the plot.",

After such a long production, which involved new technology in order to film performance capture scenes underwater, a feat never accomplished before, this movie was meant for greatness after the astonishing success of the first movie. Watching it in IMAX 3D as it is meant to be seen, was a magnificent out-of-this-world experience and definitely immersive. However, the plot is a bit simple and the decision to keep the same villain could be seen as tedious and not willing to take risks with a new villain in the third film could lead to disaster. The Tulkun parts of the movie are extremely sweet and tragic and these creatures are the highlight of the movie. But this is one of the prime examples of a fantasy world done right, with its extra-realistic visual effects and its complete lore. I would have liked a more innovative score, but I guess no one can surpass the late James Horner.",

At least that's how it seems based on the script (especially the scenes with the developers who choose to mine whale extract instead of ore) and the romance between Lo'ak and Tsireya, which tried to remind or imitate the relationship of Jake and Neytiri with the already hackneyed I See You ... where during which there was zero chemistry between them (since Lo'ak has a relationship with the whale rather than her). More interesting were the characters of Kiri and Spider, whose story component is a little more interesting (since their origin is shrouded in mystery), but unfortunately pushed to the background, because frolicking in the water and fighting the enemy (which, in my opinion, is completely easy) is more important as a story arc (the only ones who more or less have this story arc complete are Jake and Neytiri, who are less important here than it seems). In short, Avatar 2: The Way Of Water delivers a nice visual (for which it gets 10/10 from me)\n    but the script is only weak 4/10 (Cameron dealt with nostalgia and references to his previous and other films (Titanic Free Willy and Avatar) while it harmed the idea of \u200b\u200bthe film and the more complex portrayal of the characters that the film would have moved to a better level (if the script didn't rip off other movies and focus more on the characters then it could be as good or even better than Avatar (2009) but I'm sorry to say that the first Avatar was better because it kept something in me that only the second sequel can hardly repeat...",

Therefore it was a great movie to reintroduce the world of Avatar to fans and will leave us wanting more from pandora and the Sully family.",

My only desire is to see the 9-hour cut of the film I am hoping they will release an extended version on DVD.

His monologues you hear throughout the movie also take you out of it a little, where it sometimes feels like he's pointing out the obvious. The movie also has great pacing, Because despite it being over 3 hours, it Barely felt boring accept for a little at the beginning. The affects are also amazing.

Only general opinions. \nThe movie was a bit campy at first, but fun if I tried not to take it too seriously. Entertaining beyond the slightly silly parts that I don't think were intended to be silly. But by the end of the movie I felt generally unsatisfied - it made me sad without an enjoyable adventure along the way. I'm not even sure if I'm glad I saw it or not. It was also more violent than the first installment. \n\nSpoiler time! You've been warned. \nThere was VERY LITTLE EXTERNAL PLOT DEVELOPMENT from the beginning of the movie to the end. The third movie will begin much the same as this one did: \"The general is after us, but we just want peace.\" Externally, the movie begins and ends almost identically. Everyone was in the same position they were in at the beginning of the movie, but having lost someone along the way. I had the feeling that the whole awful fight, and a significant character's death, had been pointless. They objectively lost the fight. Nothing was gained, only lost. It wasn't worth it. There's no resolution. Infuriating.\n\nAs for internal character conflict and change, it was enjoyable and satisfying in certain capacities, but there were still so many questions left unanswered that I felt frustrated when the credits rolled. I felt that several of the characters moved on from their shocking and uncharacteristic behavior without recognizing its weight or making real change. I am not confident that any resolution of some of these plot points is yet forthcoming. So, I am left to disapprove of several of the main characters and still be expected to root for them. I eventually felt very disconnected because of that. \n\nThis is not in line with James Cameron's usual high quality. For an original story, which is rare these days, I am grateful. The visuals were almost unmatched. It was an enjoyable ride. But from a writing and plot perspective, from a storytelling artistry perspective, it was very disappointing. Part of me wishes I had never seen it.",

I left the theatre with a very bad feeling, due to the unnecessary use of violence in the movie. Cameron even had the audacity to bring violence into the Light - filled scenes, by making the characters portray extreme violence as they defended against the Sky People. The end of the movie was of course, the best part as obvious Lighted magic came forth through the daughter to save the family. To me, that was the highlight of the movie !

Although, the period of when the main plot is ignored in favour of character development for Jake's and Natiri's children, it is very much high quality and a great watch. \n\nThere are a couple of not so very likeable characters (also new) and replayed tropes from the first film which can be a little distracting, but once again the execution of the film in whole outweighs the negative and easily ranks as one of the best films of 2022, and the last decade.

It has got to be one of James Cameron's most personal films, despite the expansive fantasy setting. The importance of family is a strong theme carried all throughout the film, and you can tell Cameron was drawing from his own experience as a father.\n\nIt's hard to deny the impact these two movies have had--and are having--on people. You can quibble about the story being too thin, or the kids getting into trouble too often, or a variety of nitpicks, but you'd be missing the point.\n\nThe movie also gets bonus points from me from not featuring a \"go here, get this, do that\" MacGuffin storyline.

I'd say it's kinda slow in the beginning and sort of middle because of the actual showcasing of the beauty of the water tribe and the surroundings.  It really shows all the hard work that was put into the making of this film.  It was so surreal and beautiful\u2026 etc\u2026. It's so hard to put words into how fascinated and surprised with how the movie turned out.  I honestly didn't think it could get much better in visuals, but I was oh so wrong.  I mean the storyline was kind of average, but I honestly still vibed with it lol.  I just like the references and stuff with how the world is now and our treatment towards the planet.  Seeing these visuals in the film\u2026 is something I've never seen in real life before\u2026 nothing as pretty in nature.  I've seen some beautiful things but nothing that wasn't necessarily touched by humans\u2026 \n\nTo sum it up\u2026 since I probably was too passionate about this lol\u2026. I thought it was amazing and awe-dropping.  \n\nI totally recommend it for those who really appreciate the beauty and hard work these people put into the film.",

It is as much a voyage of discovery for the viewer as it is for the Scully's. At the heart of (good) science fiction are core human values - love, family, fatherhood, identity, loyalty, friendship - and while the CGI and effects are spectacular, the heart of the movie lies in the story.

I saw it at the Hollywood/Highland Chinese Theater in IMAX 3D with High Frame Rate.  \nB The 3D is a must the high frame rate Im still trying to decide whether its a distraction or  enhancement to the film.

Ill say this, they occur at odd times and are not entirely transparent.\nIn the end see it and be amazed by some top notch filmmakers!  Enough said.",

Aren't there any other bad guys in the universe besides Colonel Quaritch? Did they sell out of themes at the theme store? Why do humans always have to exploit natural resources for money? We do a lot of other really bad stuff too which could create great conflict for our blue heroes.\n\nIf I'm still alive when Avatar 3 comes out, I will probably still go to see it. I'm invested now and still hopeful that Cameron or his descendent will deliver something spectacular. But I'm the kind of guy who would stay up late to see a lunar eclipse or passing comet because they are rare and I still seek wonder.",

            "content": "Wow. I don't know when the world decided to turn on Avatar but the first one was one of the first movies I remember transforming my imagination. I was 9 when it came out and it invited me into a world I had never even thought of. And now I hope everyone has learned to never underestimate James Cameron. Avatar: The Way of Water is the most visually stunning movie of the year that manages to tell a fantastic, albeit very long, story of family and respect for the world around us. The world building is insane, two movies have fleshed out Pandora so much already, granted that's like 6 hours of content at this point. I love the added bioluminescence that is all over the place in this movie. Now yes, this movie is long as hell but it's paced so well that it almost seems to fly by. I was tempted to look at my watch once but then got sucked into the movie and never thought about it again. Sam Worthington still does a great job as Jake, and it's nice to see him changed now that he's a father. Zoe Saldana is such a gift, she is truly amazing as Neytiri, but she does get done a little dirty with a severe lack of screen time in the 2nd act. Sigourney Weaver does a good job making herself sound like a teenage version of herself. Stephen Lang becomes a much better villain this time around with more depth. Kate Winslet, Cliff Curtis, Joel David Moore, CCH Pounder, Edie Falco, Brendan Cowell, Jemaine Clement, Jamie Flatters, Britain Dalton, Trinity Bliss, Jack Champion, Bailey Bass, Filip Geljo, Duane Evans Jr, Giovanni Ribisi, and Dileep Rao make up a great supporting cast of new characters and brief returning faces. Honestly there are a lot of characters and I hope I got everyone because the blue faces make it a little hard to recognize some of these great actors. The score from Simon Franglen is the perfect cherry on top of this movie. It truly is just so beautiful and deserves the praise it's getting. IMAX is a MUST, the 3D is good but not necessary. I am most definitely giving Avatar: The Way of Water a big 10/10 and a bigger recommendation. I am just so excited to see the rest of this franchise now, I never left the ship but I welcome back all those who left. -Tyler.",

The visuals are amazing and next level with James Cameron (the director) making many sequences 48 fps in order to get a crisper image for the sequences. However, where the movie falls short is the story. There were many scenes where someone would say something important and it would never be mentioned again even though that important thing seems crucial to the story. I also feel like the movie was way too long and that many of those scenes I referred to could have been deleted. I also felt like many of the characters did not get to work together. Even though they all had their moment to shine. Others just got tossed aside while others worked together at the end of the film. Now I know I\u2019m being picky and that most of these issues will be resolved in a later film, but I feel like these issues could have been fixed if James Cameron deleted one scene and added onto another scene that did not get enough time to progress and evolve in the story. While this movie does have its issues in story telling it does make it up by having amazing visuals making this movie a visual masterpiece and a must see in theaters.",

Unfortunately, not even the new backdrops introduced are enough to give this movie a pass, as all of the flora and fauna felt like a simple reskinning of the ones we had already seen in the original. Overall, I was disappointed in this film and I can't really recommend it unless you're just so into cgi that you can't miss it.",

The children and camerawork both work together to create an extraordinary viewing experience. It's also a quality action movie, certainly better than nearly everything from MCU phase 4. I had fun watching it. I think the return of colonel quaritch and his team was done pretty well. I also think adding a family dynamic to the story helped a lot with the repetitiveness of plot points. \"Bro\" was used way too many times throughout the movie. Speaking of the siblings, Tuk was flat and served to only as someone to be rescued, this will hopefully change in thr next movie. And Neteyam, the eldest, also felt flat which served to create an emotionless death scene. Lo'ak and Kiri are definitely the best developed if the four but are so much so that they outshine their siblings. Sigourney Weaver plays a teenager with ease.  I also liked the development of Spider. Jake's whole arc this film was basic to say the least but well-written and I would say pretty in-character for him. But I love how the very reason Jake had his family leave (his need to protect his children) is the same reason they were found .  I hate that Neytiri fell into the background when Zoe Saldana is easily one of the best actors in the film. Overall, the whole movie was really busy and was a lot of set-up for the next films. Which I don't hate, but I feel that it will be easily shown up by the first and following films.  Also what is the logic of leaving your own tribe to \"protect them\" only to go ahead and endanger ANOTHER TRIBE!?!?!? \nI look forward to the next one.",

If not, you'll be fine just watching the second, but I'm sure you'll want to see the first after The Way of the Water. The underwater details, colors and sea creatures are stunning. personally, I have watched it twice as this is once in a lifetime experience and I wanted to enjoy the movie. James Cameron is a master of his art. The runtime might scare you off but by the time the movie is over, you'll be happy you watched it. The story starts off slow before building momentum.    I'd reccommend seeing it on Imax if possible. You've already waited this long to watch it,might as well watch in on the big screen. It'll look cleaner and bigger. if you have to go to the washroom,I'd say go in the first half.",

This is by far hands down the best aspect of this film from beginning right to the very end. Almost all the members of the family have some kind of through-arc and balance each other out. \n\nOthers will say the visuals are fantastic, well for how much it costs and long they worked it had better be. As such this wasn't as groundbreaking as the original there's some clearly badly done CGI and terrible voice syncing with a couple of characters. It also is very excessive with it, done at lot more and with less purpose than the original.\n\n\nSPOILERS!!!!\n\n\nWhile I may be a family man I also love good film and especially good science fiction. To put it bluntly this film is a terrible sequel and absolutely abysmal sci-fi film. This film is mind-numbingly stupid, while the original wasn't smart film-making by any standard it at least knew how borrow tropes well and used them to decent effect. It also knew how to handle its science fiction concepts properly with its world and how we understand things. This film not only managed to make the humans more cartoonishly evil, but stupider, less imposing, and less nuanced. This was the film to do the opposite here. This was the film not to waste people's time with pacifistic, migrating, telepath whales who don't actually have telepathy. This was the film to expand your science fiction concepts not break your previous rules and only add one more in a throw away line in which we see absolutely zero results. \n\nAs such I give it 2.5 stars as it easily could have been a fantastic film by just tweaking its ideas and making people smarter, unfortunately it's so dumb that it almost makes the original Avatar worse by this one's very existence. Ultimately the first Avatar is better.",

He is out and next second he is in. Sometimes it seems edits were in the wrong order. The sudden acceptance by the villain of his son , just like ship, doesn't hold water. The flagrant stealing of M\u0101ori culture to me was a bit crass. A missed opportunity to share about the planet and ecology turns into a violent pissing context between sully and the family and the colonel. Cheap and easy just like the edits. The film could have been an hour shorter and we would have missed nothing. Unfortunately we will be exposed to a third one no doubt. An emotionally charged movie that could have and should have been more than the cheap and easy gore fest it is. Very disappointed. Oh yeah the 3D was a distraction too. If I ever meet mister Cameron I will tell him myself . Dissatisfied disappointed and disillusioned",

While the Avatars in the first movie often still had a cartoon like appearance, they as all the creatures around them do actually really look alive in this edition.

What script writer and director can screw up a movie so ridiculously horrible after nearly 3 hours of near excellence? Halfway through the final battle the Sully family  is suddenly all alone fighting against each and every of the bad guys left. What happened to the chief of the Metkayinas (sea people), his ferocious wife and all the other dozens of fighters. They suddenly, from one second to the other, simply disappear from the scene, turning an, up to that point, absolutely marvelous movie into a big joke (they all only reappear at the very end on the beach\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude23\ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude1d). Minutes later after the fighters' disappearance once again, and only to add a few more minutes of ridiculous action, the whole already freed family decides to return to the sinking ship instead of simply swimming underneath the oncoming flames which are obviously only ON TOP OF THE WATER, all of them being able to dive for many minutes at a time.

Thus the long start of the movie gave the audience insight into the connection Jake's family has with each other - but also the connection the newly introduced people of the marine navi have with the water.

            "content": "Avatar: The Way of Water is a visual spectacle from start to finish. The scenery, cinematography, and CGI constantly had a smile on my face, but is it enough to carry the film?\n\nWhile the previous entry had its fair share of story-related problems, the sequel corrects most of my issues and delivers a heartfelt family story. The main improvement from the first entry is character development. I had a genuine emotional connection with the Sully family and was invested in their safety. These feelings created some genuine tension when any of the family members were in danger, I felt my body tense up as I waited to see what the conflict's conclusion would be, which is a gigantic improvement from the first film where I could not care less who died or survived.\n\nThe return of Stephan Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch brought the overly campy villain back to the screen in a bad way. Quaritch is a caricature of a \"villain\" where his actions and attitude are evil for the sake of being the bad guy. His anger toward Jake Sully does seem a little bit more believable hear as his previous self was murdered by him, but the over-the-top theatrics are just too much for me.\n\nAnother aspect of the story that did not feel right to me was the children constantly disobeying their parents for the sake of plot progression. Countless times, Jake Sully's kids would do the opposite of what they were told, leaving them in a vulnerable state to be captured. This danger forced Jake Sully to constantly expose himself and help draw the threat ever closer to his family. The moments that result are great as we get to see the dichotomy between Jake being a father and his militaristic background. This is at the heart of the story and worked for me.\n\nI was surprised to see how well-paced the film was despite its over three-hour runtime. There are some pretty slow parts, specifically the second act, but the visuals and the character journeys that happen during these parts are so interesting that they didn't impact me negatively; I was just happy to see new and beautiful aspects of Pandora.\n\nThe performances were fantastic throughout. It is a testament to both the actors/actresses and also the technology that can display such complex emotions and visual nuances on entirely CGI creatures. Sigourney Weaver was a highlight with Kiri, who was at the forefront of the entire film. To be completely honest, I did not even know she was played by Weaver; the mix between her performance and voice modulation created a compelling 14-year-old girl that was a huge part of the story. Sam Worthington was incredible and Zoe Saldana was perfect. Saldana does so much acting with her facial expressions as Ney'tirl, which is on display during many emotional scenes her character goes through. She was a bit sidelined during this film, but when she was on screen, she was impactful.\n\nAvatar has some incredibly heavy themes at play. One of the strongest and most relevant messages was anti-poaching. I mention this because there was such a hard scene in this movie that had me on the verge of tears. It was something I'd never seen in the film; it was both beautiful in the brutality it displayed and the emotional response of the Na'vi.\n\nOverall, this movie is deserving of the hype and needs to be seen on the biggest screen available. James Cameron delivered on the 13 years build-up to the sequel and has gotten me excited for the three sequels planned for the next decade.\n\nScore: 88%\nVerdict: Excellent",

The villain is flat and dumb, he even says he will go to hell, like he doesn't even think he's doing something good. The family is a fairly good emotional core for the film, nothing you haven't seen before. Overall: definetly style over substance but still not as bad as most franchise blockbusters in recent memory, i wouldn't recommend to watch it at home when it starts streaming, but it's a must see if you have an IMAX theatre near you.",

This is a movie that is stuck in exposition for far too long, leading to its dragging 3:15 runtime.

The film is visually stunning. James Cameron knew what he was doing because this is really well shot with beautiful imagery and CGI that is so good, you feel like you are actually in the world of Pandora. That leads into the next pro which is how much I love the continued exploration of this world and how immersive it can be. The world building is just as strong as the first with creative creative creature designs and interesting ideas on full display. The score is great but sadly misses that James Horner magic the first film's score had. The acting is good, especially from Stephen Lang who gives a strong performance as the villain. He played the villain in the first film and I found that he was a little generic. In this one though, he is much better explored compared to the first and feels like much more of a threat. I also found there to be some really likeable characters with some of them even being memorable. Surprisingly, the film has a good amount of emotional moments that hit hard, especially with its family storyline. The film is entertaining throughout with the action being just as fun if not more fun than the first, even being better shot than the already amazing action in the first film. That's very prevalent in the very strong last hour where all the action is put center stage with an entertaining, fun, and at times emotional 3rd act. Like previously stated though, it does have its faults. Some side plots I feel don't get enough exploration and feel completely forgotten by the end of it. The films main problem though is how it suffers from some pacing issues and disjointed editing during the 2nd act. Overall though, while the first film is still a great movie, Avatar: The Way of Water improves on some of the problems of the first tremendously and while it does have faults of its own, the good outweighs the bad in this sequel that was definitely worth the 13 year wait.",

The film IS flawed; heavy punctuation on significant statements or emotional moments weigh the picture down.\n\nIt soars, however, comfortably clearing the epopnimous water, through the startling visual effects, most notably in the ocean. The Tulkans - my stand-out performers of the entire piece - are a delight. \n\nThere's one scene (you'll know when it arrives) that is genuinely distressing (I don;t mind this in context, but it was easily the least comfortable I've felt in a cinema for some time). The action/ battle sequences are laboured and we still have to swallow that a warrior can fire off a dozen arrows, all hitting their target, none of them anywhere near the main protaginist. \n\nBut I'll forgive all that, if I can just swim with the Tulkans and enjoy the penny dropping about Kiri's origins, something that will no doubt play out in the sequels to come.",

Another lesson in how good CGI and cinematography does not necessarily mean a good movie.\n\nAlso, the story is written like a childrens movie, which is fine.

Unnecessary 10 minutes scene of killing tulkun very cruel graphical and disturbing\nThe movie wants to portrait the family importance but in reality all members seems alone and in their dramas. No bonding, novelty, respect to oldest, intimacy , trust. Every relationship seems on a surface nothing deep . I was hoping to see something big, inspiring, deep, philosophical like the first movie was.\nAldo the voice of Kiri sounded like 60 yo lady and her story was on a surface too\nI wasn't able to connect to any character and the final part of the movie showing titanic \"common bro\" \u263a\ufe0f\nVery average movie",

Still, the plot was not the brightest part of the film, but still good. The last 30 minutes were action all over and I kind of liked how the beginning chilled hours ended in a continued suffering with Neytiri and Jake. SPOILERS AHEAD:\n\nI'm not a fan of Quaritch's comeback and it also broke for me the logic of the film. Why does the human kind need to harvest glandula from the Tulkun in order to stay young when we are able to rebirth people as Avatars and transfer consciousness and memories of old? I'm sure that if that's the case they could rebirth people as humans too. Maybe I'm thinking too much, still I loved the film and am gladly going to watch it again in few days.",

I get the existential parallels to today\u2019s Earth but it dashes all hope that future Earth was able to save its soul. In these ways this movie provides no escapism. The beauty of the Pandora flora and fauna and the Na\u2019vi people can\u2019t be enjoyed for long before the violence and destruction comes crashing in. If there is a third Avatar movie, which I\u2019m sure there will be judging from the gaping opening at the end which really made no sense, then I hope it brings less violence and some comfort that humans aren\u2019t the worst species in the universe (even tho they probably are).

But much like the first film it is let down by clunky dialgoue and a fairly predictable story. Avatar was a huge film in every sense of the word. A massive box office success, director James Cameron worked many years on making a sequel and I think he mostly succeeds. The film takes place more than a decade after the original. The Na'vi have repelled the human invasion of Pandora and Jake Sully has become one of them and is now chief of the clan with his own family. But their peaceful existence is ruined when the humans return again to colonise Pandora as Earth is dying. Sully leads the resistence so he is a made a target by the humans (or 'Sky People'). Sully and his family escape to live among the Metkayina who live near the water. This is where the film really takes off as the scenes above and below water are quite spectacular. Of course their new peaceful existence doesn't last long and the battle between the Na'vi and the invading humans takes up again. As a visual film this film is quite stunning. There are some sequences that will take your breath away. But like a lot of Cameron films there is little room for character development and the dialogue is quite obvious at times. But this demands to be seen on the big screen. So if you accept the faults it's a fun ride.",

While I do like the way they advanced the plot, I found myself bored during many scenes. Scenes that I thought started well and interesting, eventually went on too long and lost my attention. Even the big battle went on way too long. \nJust when I thought it was over, the movie goes into a Titanic sequence and even takes a bit of a turn reminiscent to Star Wars with Luke trying to redeem his father. \nI was happy to see they found a way to bring  back the Colonel who was a great villain in my opinion but the plot line with he and Spider, which started with promise was lacking and fell flat. \nIt is a movie that must be seen in a theater to appreciate the effects but honestly I was apprehensive sitting down for a 3 plus hour film and at times many of the prettier sequences were  just plain masturbatory and not necessarily essential to the plot. \nI am not sure I would see this movie more than once the way I did the original.",

The detail in culture differences and tensions that arose from it could have been given more depth by using redemption arcs rather than altruism. I expect to see more development in the love/hate relationships between the two factions and Spider probably getting his own avatar and being drawn away from the Na'Vi to the Merc/Avatars/Demons/Skypeople. I also could have done with less \"military\" lingo. Being a Marine myself it felt clunky and also irrelevant to the common movie goer. No civilians know what Oscar Mike means and Marines cant regroup in hell, they wont let us in because they're afraid we'll take over. Still a good movie though and I WILL be watching the sequels. James is still the man when it comes to giving the audience a solid fantasy film and visual masterpiece. Thank you James Cameron!!!!!",

The middle section of the three hours, when it really gets into showing the marine environment, is wonderful and beautiful.  But the plot is basically a rehash despite the new setting, and the story is not engaging because of the inexplicable choice by the director to use the kind of high frames-per-second filming technique that produces the so-called \"soap opera\" visual effect.  In short, this makes it impossible to forget that you are watching people act and pretend to be Avatars.  That aspect alone made it impossible for me to be swept up in the beautiful fantasy world of Pandora, like I was when I saw the first film.  The 3D effect was enjoyable but it still didn't make up for the soap opera visual quality.",

I love alien and fantasy worlds, sci-fi concepts, nature (always a sucker for whales too) and weird animals (I particularly love speculative zoology), so this ticks all my personal boxes. Seeing the film in IMAX 3D is like a ride. I would love the story and world anyway, but the visuals definitely enhanced the experience. The story is relatively simple, but that is a good thing - too many films try to cram a series' worth of narrative and characters into a few hours of film and wonder why it falls flat. Films are designed for simpler stories imo. This was also a lot more character driven than the first, which I liked.\n\nDon't go into this film expecting Citizen Kane, just go for some otherworldly escapism and enjoy the ride. It has it's nitpicks in the story (what film doesn't) and is not a perfect film, but it's one of the most enjoyable and solid films to come out in years and one of the only films I'll spend cinema money on as seeing that world come to life on the big screen is a fantastic experience.\n\nThe first film was likened to dances with wolves, ferngully etc, but this isn't that story. I'm not sure why people say it's the same story, it's not. It's got the same themes of protecting nature and animals from human brutality, but those are themes. The narrative is much more focused on the kids, specifically three of them who each have an interesting story that will clearly expand in the next films.",

I didn't feel the weight of needing to protect the environment they were in\nbecause the threats to it felt recycled and without as much significance as the previous film had.\nThe amount of characters and their individual plot lines made for reduced empathy for them. Jake had a major transformation last time  removing himself from his militaristic ethos to join the Na'avi and now employs it so heavily it ruins the relationships he has with his kids and puts their lives at risk as they try to live up to him. He is not a complex yet likeable character in this film, rather one dimensional and mean. Kitty's epilepsy felt unnecessary, it was brought up as a major evolvement but then never touched on again - her identity issue is never resolved. Nor was the motivation for hunting animals for their youth juice. They both felt as empty vessels to carry the movie forward without having any weight for themselves.\nThe appropriation of Pacific Island cultures was distasteful and a rightful reason for Indigenous people to be boycotting this film. With the more than on the nose use of M\u0101ori facial expressions and body language, it's hard to miss as offensive.\n\nIf you can look past all of this however, the movie makes for an engaging spectacle with you kept in awe of exploring new territories of Pandora.",

You are too busy being mesmerized by the visuals and worrying about the true stars of the film\u2026 the kids.

This movie clocks in at 3 hours and 12 minutes.... and for most of that time you forget that our protagonist Jake Sully is a paraplegi,c human living in an avatar aka a Na'vi alien's body, and is sexually involved with an alien. I will give it to him, he is one alien man, not unfaithful, .. but she still is a blue alien with a tail. Let me put it this way. I love my dog, if I could, for a few days, be a dog, I would love that! I would love to take naps all day, frolic in the yard, and, given the chance, take a shit on my neighbor's lawn while he watches me. But if I were a human living in a dog's body, I would not, in a million years, have sex with another dog, not even my dog, who I am emotionally connected to and is a very cute dog. It would be weird... dare I say criminal. But I digress.   \nThe action in this movie was sooooo good. This chapter of Avatar introduces several young Na'vi characters, mainly Jake Sully's offspring, who were conceived when he had unprotected sex with an alien. The antagonist is the avatar in Na'vi form of Colonial Qearitch. His sole mission is a revenge mission to hunt down and kill Jake Sully's avatar. He is mad at Jake because Jake killed him in the previous movie... side note- if you can believe (and cheer for) a human that has sex with an animal, being able to accept the fact the colonial, died and came back as an Avatar is not a huge reach. I would also like to interject that maybe if you have a paradigm shift where colonial is not after revenge, but rather hunting a man that has sex with aliens, perhaps the colonial wouldn't be considered that bad of a guy... just my two cents. \n\nThis movie also introduces talking whales, who are incredibly bright and have rich dialogue, such as \"it is just too emotionally difficult for me to talk about right now\" when the whale is pressed as to why he is excluded from the other whales, during their whale games. They were a fun new characters, but  I did get a little uncomfortable any time Jake was around them because I thought he might try and have sex with their blowholes. \n\nIf James Cameron made ET today, I wonder if he would make Elliot a teenager exploring his sexual identity. I would imagine it might go something like this-  \"Mom! I found an alien in our shed. We have a huge emotional connection. I think I am going to try and have sex with it.\"",

It was an ode to male aggression, and didn't offer any real redemption for either the avatar planet inhabitants nor humans, becoming more ensconced in making the planet's people look more and more ''like American Indians\" defending their lands than a people who could actually transcend such aggressions, as implied by the title, \"The Way of Water\" (Tao). This is a missed opportunity for James Cameron, who has fallen back on clich good vs. evil, killing with impunity the \"bad\" invaders instead of teaching better 'ways' to all. Some parts were nice, we enjoyed the children and their character development, the CGIs and artistry of the underwater worlds were phenomenal, but all that did not redeem the film, especially since the children and whale-like creatures were used to wage war when  they could have shown higher evolution and taught better ways or at least been more clever than repeatedly using blunt force. Also, my Japanese friends took offense and felt culturally shamed at the Japanese writing on the whale-killing torpedo's.  Unlike the West, the Japanese did not practice large scale whale commercial hunting until the McCarthy years of the 1950's, when Americans, trying to rebuild Japan and looking to get more protein for the Japanese diet, basically  made them do this? At least they used the whole whale as well. Very few Japanese eat whale anymore, and many are against it.",

I thought the detail of how the actors moved, and how facial emotions translated from the mo-cap was impressive. I liked the change in scenery the new water setting brought, I felt the Maori-inspired culture of the new Na'vi tribe was a breath of fresh air, and the added detail of the evolutionary changes between the water and forest people was a nice touch. The HFR really smoothed out the action scenes, but I am glad there was a transition back to the standard frame rate for the slower-paced scenes to avoid the issues that the Hobbit trilogy audiences complained about. The first movie for me was a bit of a romance with Jake falling in love with Neytiri and the forest, but this one really centred around the parents and their love for their family unit. I thought the emotional stakes were much higher because even though there were some corny moments, I found myself getting emotional during some of the sadder moments in the movie, which the first movie didn't really do.\n\nIf you want to find flaws in the movie, like with any movie you will find them, but that's an issue not an issme. Avatar 2: The Way of Water is an action, science-fiction movie set in a beautifully unique world with a conservation message at its heart. There are more storylines established making it not seem like it's idling, and any slower moments are used to show the beauty of this rich world. But when the action kicks in, you better hold tight. I would recommend this movie to someone who is an easy-going movie watcher, it's a fun, immersive ride that has real emotional stakes. \n\nSo let's get it done!",

Don't get me wrong, the movie was decent. But SPOILERS:\nThe bringing back of Quaritch as the main villain felt very lazy and low effort in my opinion. Retconning can be useful in stories. I'm not someone who hates a retcon for simply being a retcon, many sequels and franchises can greatly be improved from retconning small details. However, the retcon of suddenly, the humans had the tech to store someone's entire consciousness onto a little disk and store that onto an Avatar that they suddenly decided to grow for Quaritch just in case so they could bring him back like, a decade later? Yeah, I don't buy that very much. The Sully family also moving away from the Forest to the new Sea home also felt quite forced. I get why from a writing standpoint and it made for some enjoyable scenes and amazing CGI. But I felt like it could've been far better executed.\n\nAll in all, the movie was enjoyable and I'd recommend it to most people simply for the amazing Visuals and finally getting the continuation to the first movie.

Humans are colonizing a planet they can't even breathe on, while they know there are massive dangerous intelligent creatures literally infested everywhere?!? The first avatar's mining plot made more sense. Then I found myself rooting for the \"bad guy humans\" firstly they don't have a goal of murdering everything, they just want sully who has been attacking their operations from the start. And the Navi seem too dumb to realize that they could probably negotiate with these humans, and live in \"harmony\" with them as well. So as a result we watch one of the most visually stunning pointless battles in movie history. And at the end, I just found myself wishing Jake sully just turned himself in and we got to watch the Navi do cool visual things.'' (Nate E.)",

There's a realism and looseness to the dialogue which feels fresh.  The family dynamics, as well as those between tribes, are effective and, at times heart-wrenching.  The colors absolutely dazzle.  If you can, see it on the biggest screen possible (preferably Imax, as I did, or in Dolby).  The 3D is awe-inspiring, and at times I wanted to reach out and touch what was on screen.  Whether the focus is on sea or land, life absolutely bursts; however, the scenes under-water are immersive enough to make you hold your breath.  Yes, the film clocks in at over 3 hours but you won't feel it.  You won't care.  I didn't want the visual spectacle to end.  Frankly, I can't wait to visit Avatar for round 3.  This is one of the best films of the year.  On a technical-level, it proves that James Cameron sits at the top of the throne.  Grade:  A+",

Humans have been telling stories since the dawn of time, so It's almost impossible to come up with something that's new and/or original. Which is why it in no way stops Avatar the way of water from being an absolute joy to watch.\n\nMy eyes were glued to the screen as I took in the breath taking world. A world that feelt familiar to what we know from Avatar 1, yet fresh as it explores a whole new and until now completely unseen side of pandora. If you are an individual that doesn't care for amazing visuals and can't stand a semi predictable storytelling, this movie probably ain't for you. If however, you get even the slightest amount of enjoyment from beautiful cinematography, then Avatar the way of water is a must watch for the visual spectacle alone.",

The first film focused on loss, exploration into a fascinating new beautiful world, conflicting alliances and rebirth. This film focused on misbehaving children and the cowardice of the once proud Na'vi race. Neytiri, a great character in the first film, had little time on screen to do anything except scream in anguish a few times. She was channeling my thoughts about how horrible this franchise has degraded.\n\nThe whole film was just misbehaving children, blurry distracting 3D, next to no story or character development and 3 1/2 hours I wish I could have back.

We see the 'star people' return in the sky.  Why don't they take whatever weapons of war they had left from the first one and prevent them from establishing a base?!  oh all that stuff was destroyed to go back to nature.  I thought the Na'vi were smart.  Because the SMART part after the end of Avatar #1 was to figure a way to mine unobtainium eviro-friendly and to work with Earth, not just RDP, to sell it and buy planetary defense systems.

The characters were too predictable and it missed the emotions of the first movie---so what if a main character dies-let's throw a party and swim some more.  And that whale like creature with its eye---Norwahl from Elf was more interesting-------it had me thinking that Jar Jar Binx was a better character.

CG is awfully amazing!!!\nEven though I know characters are all made of CG, I thought they are real... The scene when characters are moving in the water was the most stunning scene for me.\n2. The story is not extremely dramatic!\nI could expect what to happen and how a character behave in the movie; still I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. It seems like all scenes are dedicatedly depicted in delicate ways (WOW)\n3. Sound and music are well organized and make audience fall into the magical incidents.\nI think the bgm used in Avatar 2 did play a great role in the movie. Every sound was enthralling and elaborate... Awesome :D\n4. It's too loooooong....\nIf you plan to go to theater for this, you should take something soft to sit for your hip not to hurt lol\n\nSummary: If you have ENOUGH time and a LITTLE heart to watch Avatar 2, just watch it :D",

All driven by vendetta, greed, prejudice, etc., oh, and a small mention that the Earth is dying.  \"Why?\", you ask.  Because humans ruined it of course!

I was blown away at how beautiful every single thing in the movie is. I went in knowing it would be killer, but it did surpass my expectations.\n\n  Now, to the movie and story. It was just more of the same. There was not a moment in it where I was surprised, or some major jaw dropping twist. It played out just like most of us figured it would. Same story as the first, this time it revolved around the water (which again was beautiful.)\n\n  There really was a point, somewhere in the middle of the movie, that I realized if I were going to watch the whole movie, I would have to work to do so. It just didn't grab me and hold on. A viewer should never have to work and to fight, to keep their attention on a movie, the movie is supposed to do that.\n\n  It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't good either. It was somewhere in the middle. Had the CGI not been amazing, I wouldn't have made it through the movie. But I do believe, for most movie goers, they will find a fun time, and a tidy story. That is, if the length of the movie, doesn't turn out to be the thing that causes them to drift off into a daydream.",

Answers were in the movie, but a little buried. Loved the interpersonal relationships and interactions among the Sully Family and between the Sully Family and the Sea People - very well written and acted.

This film connects how important our world relies on other species, both on land and in the sea.

            "content": "Avatar The Way of Water is one of the biggest sequels in the past decade or so, it's coming off the original Avatar, which is notoriously the highest-grossing film of all time. This was a massive task for James Cameron to pull off, and I think from a technical standpoint he was able to achieve his vision. This is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen in my entire life, there are so many sequences that had me in awe, and I genuinely have zero clue on how they even made this movie. However, while I do think that this is better than the first Avatar film, it's not by a whole lot. Besides its gorgeous visuals Avatar, The Way of Water really does struggle at points to find its footing. It starts off pretty slow and gets better throughout each act, but these characters are still not as nearly as engaging as they should be. I am still not sold on Jake Sully as a protagonist whatsoever, he's got some badass moments here but he's pretty forgettable in this. His children are definitely the main focus here, and when the film fully focuses on them and their arcs I found myself much more engaged. I have somewhat similar feelings for this as I did for the first film, from a technical standpoint it's one of the best-looking films ever put to screen. Its visuals sell this movie alone and make this movie way better than it should be. But sadly due to some awkward dialogue, and characters that just feel redundant and generic, it loses some points here. But even with this said, I had fun watching and think there are more positives here than negatives, it provides a visual spectacle unlike no other and had me engaged even with this monstrous runtime. At the end of the day, I think the biggest thing I'll take away from this film is to not take movies like this for granted. This is probably the best-looking film ever made, it's the definition of a movie theater experience. I'm so grateful to embrace film in this current age through films such as this. Leaving the theater and entering the real world was a real bummer after visiting Pandora for three hours.",
