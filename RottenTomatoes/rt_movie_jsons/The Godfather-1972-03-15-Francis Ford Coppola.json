It's like a well-executed puzzle with pieces fitting together, once again, flawlessly. Each scene deserves its very own mini movie and everyone was just captivating in their portrayal of their characters.

Other clandestine families will not be too optimistic about their monopoly, the godfather's relationship will be questioned, his life will be threatened, and more conflict and revenge will follow.\n\nThe camera moves slowly and deliberately, the environment is close and natural, gravity does not give anger or anxiety, understanding is possible, and the images seamlessly shift in convincing continuity. The rhythm and stage direction serve concepts that help to understand the mafia: a culture with its own norms and values.\n\nViolence will break out and Coppola gives us a brilliant scene, shots that create sensations that seem real. This is the strength and determination of what will happen in the rest of the movie. The introduction of the security concept from now on is regulatory success as a possibility. The characters will have the task of solving dilemmas: unbridled violence against rational violence, passion...\n\n Without a doubt, The Godfather is one of the best films in the history of cinema. Rich and varied in its form, it represents a conceptual narrative that, while not generally associated with poetry, always expresses ideas in a historical context that clearly reflects mob culture.",

Hearing that took me back to the holidays in Europe that I've had in the past. I also thought the christening/baptism scene, towards the end, was pretty powerful, due to the obvious dichotomy facing the viewer. I also enjoyed the scene featuring Don Corleone (snr.) and the young child in the garden - there's quite an analogy present there.\n\nOf course this film contains many well known film quotes, such as 'I'll make them an offer they can't refuse' and multiple uses of Italian slang, aka mobster speak - 'badda boom, badda bang' etc. It was interesting to see the source material for such quotes (at least I assume they originated from this film, to some extent in any case).\n\nThe cast very much makes this film and for the cinematic atmosphere it gives, I would certainly recommend it to others.",

The film dwells into the fragility of the American Dream, and ultimately, life. Through the artful depiction of the mafia life, we came to sympathize with the characters in the films; even though we knew deep in our hearts that they are flawed in so many ways. On a different note, the theme song of the film, Love Theme from The Godfather by Nino Rota, is probably one of the most recognizable musical pieces out there; it is essentially up there with the likes of Vivaldi's Le quattro stagioni, Beethoven's Quasi una fantasia, and Mozart's Piano Sonata No. 11, among others.",

Marlon Brando is great in the title role, as are James Caan and Al Pacino as two of his sons.  The score is iconic, the period details are spot on, and the whole film is beautifully executed.  At the risk of committing cinematic heresy, if there is one possible complaint it could be the length of the movie, which clocks in at just under three hours.  Some scenes simply feel too long \u2013 for example, the opening wedding scene runs almost thirty minutes and while it is important to establish the hierarchy within the family and introduce characters, there are a lot of details that just don't matter.

And unlike some films that are this long, and have scenes that begin to drag and should have been cut, this film perfectly uses its run time, and every scene has a purpose and is executed phenomenally. This is true, one of the best if not the best film ever made. The only films I think that even come close to this caliber of filmmaking are the Godfather part 2 Citizen Kane, Casablanca, and Seven Samurai.

Furthermore, they are two different films in terms of engaging acting: Pacino is the focus in the subsequent film, and dare I say probably not an unpopular opinion but nevertheless my own, Brando is the star in the first, even though he doesn't play an integral role in the story particularly in the last hour of the film. Many of his final days are spent in bed and then he dies, although there is a very touching scene between his grandson and him and a sort of passing of the torch scene between him and his son(Michael).I highly recommend.This is an - essential crime film.

This masterpiece tell the story of a family of italian mafioso, who lives in the New York state in US. The story will quickly turn into a tragedy after some tragic evenement who will emotionally hustle the characters except Vito Corleone, THE Godfather, who always impresses us with his devastating calm, his wit and his charisma. The plot can seem to be just dark and violent without any reflexion behind it, but it's false. The plot is excellent and very intellectually stimuling.\nThere isn't a lot of special effect, because it's a realistic film, maybe the blood can seem a little exagerated but it isn't that important. The photography can be criticize but for a 1974's film, it's really good and make the film even better because it add a very dark and vintage atmosphere (without it, The Godfather wouldn't be The Godfather). Moreover, the acting is excellent too. The actors, in addition to be very known and succesfull, have been spectacular and very compelling. And, because the acting isn't all, the script of the film, based on Mario Puzo's novel, is also interesting and very tought-provoking.\nIn conclusion, ... if you haven't seen it yet, see it. This film is an absolute masterpiece. The casting is incredible, the acting is outstanding, the atmosphere is captivating and the plot is excellent .",

A work of art that puts all filmmaking aspects to work to perfection: the script, direction, cinematography, and the acting performances are top to notch. Based on the novel by Mario Puzo The Godfather is the story of how the mafia don of the Corleone family begins to grow old and weak and how he passes his legacy to his son. This story takes almost three hours to tell and is epic. The two leads are as great as it gets. The titan Marlon Brandon at the pinnacle of his career plays the Godfather  an old man who faces new enemies as the mafia gets into the narcotics business. His son Michael is played by Al Pacino in one of the best performances of his career if not the best. He is handsome and does not want to be a criminal but progressively becomes a calculated killer who does not blink in this epic drama filled with violence and the complexity of morality. The editing is phenomenal and this film is simply a treasure. A true piece of cinema and perhaps the best film directed by Coppola.",

            "content": "There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.\n\nTrue, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.\n\nThe Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.\n\nThen there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.\n\nThe acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.\n\nIn conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating. Bethany Cox",
