From detail-attentive storytelling to character castings that feel like the creators performed real magic to pull them from the pages, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone smartly uses its beefy runtime to tell an unmissable coming-of-age fantasy. A strong, old-timey feel creates distinct aesthetics, and John Williams' musical score is a special magic of its own.\n\nFor the full review and more posts like it, visit my site: https://thephoenixprjct.com",

It's all all of them and when watching continuously, it's very fun. If the movie comes out at each time, I think I am one of them that will definitely follow the story of this story and is a movie that can be seen.  All ages and is a movie that anyone who sees it for the first time must be excited and follow the movie from the search for information to a movie made from a personal novel. I didn't read a novel before watching the movie.  But saw people who read the movie say that the content in the novel is more diverse and more detailed in the movie and in the movie has changed a lot of chapters  But if watching a movie and going to read a novel, it might change the perspective of watching movies in another way.\n\n The plot of the movie is based on the story of a character named Harry Potter who lost his parents as a child without knowing the real reason and was raised by his biological aunt.  which the feasting is not good at all  His aunt raised him like he was a servant.  and when he reached the criteria that he had to study  The magic school had sent him a letter to attend as a preparation.  His parents actually said that his parents had died by being killed and had taken Harry to go shopping for school.  And studied at the magic school for the first time, got to know the friendship that he had accidentally encountered and learned through both the good and the bad side together as this friendship is like the only family that Harry  There is in life, no matter how the story is, his friends will help and take care of each other. It is considered a movie that represents very good friendship.  And saw the development of Harry trained to use in the fight against the people who killed his parents.  The story of Harry potter is a very interesting movie, if anyone has not seen this movie, it is a missed opportunity.\n\n In summary, from looking at and searching for information and seeing different opinions that  This movie is considered a very popular movie, most of them have to watch and are movies that can be accessed by all ages, with interesting content, worth watching and may  Getting the content from watching this movie. Overall, this movie is a magic movie, making people interested and is a realistic movie and may be different from other movies and the scripts have changed to the novel.  To have an understanding, but it may not be as detailed as the novel, for those who have read the novel may not like it that much, but it is still a favorite movie and a favorite movie for many people as well.  How many times do you think of a movie that you have to come back and watch?",

I think it was made for those who had read the books, which are lengthy children's books I wouldn't waste my time with, personally.

Robbie Coltrane is the best actor in the film with a great deal of charm more than anyone. The cinematography is very well done with very elaborate sets and well shot scenes. the only thing is the CGI at times doesn't look as good as the rest of the practical sets most of the time. The music is very well done also. The only real major knocks to this film are the editing & pacing which while still are solid, have a bit too many ideas. The film feels like the first half is about Harry & his friends adjusting to school while the second half is about the mystery of the stone. This is fine but the problem is it starts to drag and feels bloated. It feels like its being too faithful to the novel while sacrificing focus. Some scenes like the flying game, going into the restricted section could have been cut and nothing would be lost. Although there well done scenes. Also the first half with them adjusting to school feels like the scenes don't put together don't have a logical flow although there still well done. Also its worth noting most of this film has a very childish feel to it while the final act does go on the dark side and get more intense which I enjoyed. In conclusion despite some unremarkable child acting, bloated run time and unfocused narrative at times this is a solid film that holds up well. Definitely worth a watch for any fan of the franchise and worth viewing to get to the others.",

Assim, é lá que ele conhecerá mais sobre sua própria história, a de seus pais e o porquê é tão famoso no mundo da magia. Contudo, apesar de a obra ser boa, temos várias coisas que ficam sem sentidos ou excessivamente infantis tornando-a quase um filme de sessão da tarde, nesse sentido se você for uma criança, talvez ele lhe agrade mais facilmente, mas caso não, você irá notar as diversas incongruências dele.\n\nPara ser justo, o filme já tem duas décadas no momento dessa resenha, mas podemos dizer que esse filme envelheceu muito mal se comparado com outras grandes obras. Observamos péssimas atuações, efeitos especiais ridículos e vários cortes dos livros que seriam essenciais para o entendimento completo da história. É muito claro que ao se tratar de uma adaptação cortes são necessários, porém nesse caso, apesar de ele ser bem fiel ao livro, a história ainda fica perdida ou muito conveniente.\n\nDesse modo, temos uma obra que mescla o ridículo com o bom, onde, o roteiro é razoável e o principal problema são as atuações que não são nada naturais, talvez por ser difícil trabalhar com protagonistas crianças que estão imersos em um mundo que está sendo trabalhado principalmente pelo CGI e efeitos especiais, mas por incrível que pareça, tem um CGI aceitável para época. Porém, eles souberam trabalhar bem com a trilha sonora, o humor, a temática de auto descoberta e amizade do trio na aventura pela Pedra Filosofal, principalmente da metade do filme para frente. Portanto, apesar de muita coisa não convencer, ele acerta em alguns momentos, no entanto, não passa nas regras dos 15 anos, pois ele é um filme que dificilmente você conseguiria assistir novamente e é melhor ficar com a nostalgia.",

The acting from the adults were impressive as well and I really got invested in the Harry Potter universe with this first film! Imo, it's even better than the Fellowship of the Ring!

            "content": "If I'd have watched this film as a child, it would have likely been one of my favorites for a time. As an adult, I thought it had many interesting concepts and believable young and flawed characters without being too immature or annoying, but the film was held back by a lack of depth and any real stakes to draw me in very far. Everything seemed to go the protagonists' way after a point.\n\n\nFor example, Hogwarts has a magical, broom-flying sports game with a set of rules and goals that can all be negated and ignored by catching the golden snitch. Furthermore, the wizards in charge of the school arbitrarily assigning points to its students felt a bit too convenient at times, particularly near the end. If I were in Slytherin, I would be protesting Dumbledore's clear favoritism toward Gryffindor, and I hope this comes to pass considering House Slytherin is meant to represent ambition, cunning, and resourcefulness.\n\n\"But this is a movie about wizards, so the rules don't need to make sense!\" is a type of argument I hear repeated with similar stories that hold no weight with me. Magic can be explained in this universe as a natural force, so I can buy the mystique of its unknown power. But giving the protagonists constant wins from nonsensical rules is lazy world-building.\n\nTo the film's credit, unique stories were told in how the wizards (mostly Harry) interacted with the magical school of Hogwarts. This setting lends itself to interesting interactions that I wouldn't often see in other media: a child responding to his deepest desires manifested in a magical mirror or how a group of kids will react to a trap that activates based on your physical struggle against it, for example. \n\n\nMy favorite part of this movie is found in the potential stories created by the setting. While the first movie failed to live up to the full potential of the school, I hope the next few movies delve deeper into more than just classic magical battles and sports games such as exploring the various students and houses, including more of these students in the story, and not having every story conveniently end with everything coming together to the benefit of the main characters. Part of what makes Harry an intriguing character is his calm and brave demeanor despite a life of tragedy. But because the other characters didn't have an obvious deeper struggle in their backstory or their school lives, it was difficult to emphasize with them.",

            "content": "Ok - I am having to review a movie with the wrong title because the US Publisher, Scholastic, has a low opinion of American children. The movie is correctly titled Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.\n\nI will start with where the movie lets itself down - and that is in the train ride to Hogwarts. The timing is all over the place. The train seems like it has gone for an absolute age before Ron decides that everywhere else is full. Then Hermione declares that the train is nearly there, while it is still broad daylight and it arrives in the pitch dark. \n\nNear the end of the film in the chess scene, why did Ron need to be riding the chess piece? That made no sense.\n\nNow - the good bits. The overall storyline is great - yes it is simplistic, but it is based on a children's book, so that is to be expected. The dialogue has some great moments, particularly where Ron and Hermione and concerned. The cinematography is excellent too, with great use of colour. The score by John Williams is excellent - one of his best (aren't they all, though?) and evokes the magic that matches the film.\n\nAll in all, great for 2 and half hours of light, escapist entertainment.",

With the first book coming out when I was three years old and the first movie when I was seven, there is a special place in my heart for the Wizarding World of Harry Potter.\n\nI know that it is not the most remarkable piece of art when looking at it from a filmmaking perspective. However, let us remember that this movie was made for children. When it comes to world-building and enveloping the audience, I would argue that this movie goes toe to toe with Lord of the Rings and some of the other greats.\n\nWhat Chris Columbus and company did is nothing short of game-changing. They took excellent source material, stayed true to the book and built upon it. The visuals, specifically involving Hogwarts, are gorgeous. The score by John Williams is one of the most recognizable of all time. The characters are instantly likeable (or despicable). There is honestly so much to praise and love about this movie.\n\nWhile not every scene is necessary to the plot, those \"pointless\" scenes further add to the feeling of magic. From sitting in Flitwick's classroom to ruminating on a windowsill with an owl, I could watch footage of Hogwarts on repeat. This is a movie that I could turn on at any time and jump right into the story. Simply put, I instantly have a warm feeling which stays with me the whole way through.\n\nWhile the acting and dialogue have some rough moments, particularly with the younger actors, the casting is excellent. From Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane to Richard Harris and Maggie Smith, there is not a single dud when it comes to the adult cast. The students are also perfectly cast, with the main trio's chemistry on full display.\n\nAt the end of the day I'll say it again, I know that this is not a perfect film, but it is a magical film. The movie is highly rewatchable, endlessly quotable and enchantingly enjoyable. When defining \"comfort film\", this movie is at the top of the list. Simply put, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone set the stage for one of the most popular movie franchises of all time and one of the most impactful parts of my childhood.\n\nBest Character: Rubeus Hagrid\nBest Moment: Arriving to Hogwarts on the boats.\nBest Quote: \"It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.\" - Albus Dumbledore\n\nAdditional Note: Having the house cup ripped from Slytherin is why I have issues with premature celebration. That being said, the whole sequence is still chill-inducing.",

Daniel Radcliffe is very likable as Harry, and he is given solid support by a funny Rupert Grint and a good Emma Watson, though she was annoying at times. The scene stealer was definitely Robbie Coltrane; I actually can't imagine anyone else playing Hagrid, Coltrane was just hilarious. Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith were also great, but for me the standout was the late Richard Harris. Now I much prefer Harris's interpretation of Dumbledore. He was soft-spoken, and actually fitted the part better. Both of these qualities were lost in the interpretation that Michael Gambon gave. I am not saying that Michael Gambon was bad, he just wasn't my ideal choice for Harris's replacement. The film is fairly faithful to its source material, and looks very beautiful. However, it is a bit long, and very young children may find Voldemort too frightening. I know because I have triplet brother and sisters who saw it, and couldn't sleep for about a month after viewing. In conclusion, a very good film, well performed and quite dark. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

However, this is to be expected from an early 2000s movie based off a YA novel.\n\nIt's also very faithful to the original (as implied above), which is a plus, but ends up feeling unpolished, due to the fact that it has to leave out lots of things from the book.\n\nWhat the movie lacks in technical skill, it makes up for in warmth.

So in order to cleanse the bad taste that left by this movie I will share a Delicious Katmer Recipe.Un, sıcak su ve tuzu derin bir kapta karıştırın.Kulak memesi yumuşaklığında bir hamur elde edene kadar yoğurun. Hamuru 8 parçaya ayırıp parçaların her birini güzelce yuvarlayın. Tezgahı ya da başka bir düz zemini bolca unlayarak hamurları tek tek açın. Tereyağını eritip hamurların üstlerine gezdirin. Hamurları dıştan içe doğru sararak rulolar yapın. Ruloları kendi etraflarında spiral olarak sarıp 10 dakika kadar dinlendirin. Dinlenen hamurları yeniden tabak büyüklüğünde açın. Tereyağını eritip içine suyu ve tuzu ekleyin. Yeniden donmaması için kısık ateşte bekletin. Hamurların her iki tarafını da yapışmaz tavada iyice pişirdikten sonra üzerine yağlı sudan sürün. Katmerleriniz hazır. Soğumadan servis yapın.",

Everything still is extremely solid, from the acting, to the story, to John Williams amazing score. For the most part, the visual effects are solid as well, apart from one or two scenes where they do look as if they are fresh from a PS3 game. The villian is particularly weak, taking a lot of the suspicion from the source material away, instead focusing on building the wizarding world and wowing the audience.",

The young cast were a bit struggeling with the role but what can you expect with three 11 years olds. I think the director did an amazing job adapting this book to the screen. The design that is Hogwarts is beautiful.\n And the supporting cast is simply phenomenal. Alan Rickman as Snape might be the best casting I've ever seen. He plays the part perfect. \nThis movie is certainly worth the watch!!",
