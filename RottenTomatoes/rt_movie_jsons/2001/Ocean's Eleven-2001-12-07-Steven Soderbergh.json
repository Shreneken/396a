    "summary": "Dapper Danny Ocean (George Clooney) is a man of action. Less than 24 hours into his parole from a New Jersey penitentiary, the wry, charismatic thief is already rolling out his next plan. Following three rules: Don't hurt anybody, don't steal from anyone who doesn't deserve it, and play the game like you've got nothing to lose. Danny orchestrates the most sophisticated, elaborate casino heist in history.",

The usual range of heist caper characters with one exception: Julia Roberts inexplicably walks through the movie in a role that's utterly pointless except to be a sex object for George Clooney's charming criminal. Also, the ending could have been fine if the director hadn't added a totally unnecessary scene in which the individual thieves pose in what seem like curtain calls against a backdrop of dancing Las Vegas fountains, and then Clooney and Roberts, reunited in love, drive off -- tailed by two casino thugs. It's as if the producers ordered a pious wink to the long-gone production code stipulation that crime must be punished, even if by way of vague suggestion. Too many cooks in this stew. A sequel several years later, Oceans 12, is even more illogical and way too smugly self-referential, but at least Julia Roberts gets to be moderately funny.",

The cast is overflowing with A-listers: Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Andy Garcia, Julia Roberts, Bernie Mac. This new Pitt Pack is played with bemused bonhomie by all the players. They appear to be having a ball with each other. Luckily, they share that fun with us. Soderbergh also doesn't tip his hand, not giving us all the information, letting us play catch-up with the plot as it steams forward. It's a wind-up contraption of a Hollywood toy, all glitz and glamour and glib stylings. But this Rat Pack for the new millennium is a charismatic bunch of thieves who get us to root for them, and we don't mind at all",

I feel like all the actor were a bit drunk or something, because they're so chill in every goddamn situation, but that's the best thing about it, or the whole crew are only a bunch of phlegmatics, who just going to steal some things and have fun - fantastic stuff, love it. I heard that the second and third movies aren't that good so I will not watch them, because why though, by this one, oh man, this one was a ton of fun. Soderbergh is a nice director and I liked how he work with the characters, felt like some Avenger movie when we cut back and forth to these teams and see, how are they doing. A very fine movie.",

The actual heist portion is handled surprisingly well, and there are many twists and turns that keep you hooked and eager to find out where it goes next. My main issue is that sometimes the film can feel like a bit much, leading to it being pretty boring at parts.

            "content": "Ocean's Eleven is a phenomenal film that is jam-packed with fantastic characters and an energetic story. The film hardly loses itself when it comes to keeping the narrative running at a smooth pace. There are a few scenes that go on for a bit too long. However, the movie picks right back up again. The basic premise is powerful and pulls you right in just from the beginning. How are they going to rob three casinos in one night? That bonkers logline executes itself flawlessly, and it keeps the entertainment factor up. Steven Soderbergh had some stellar direction and had a creative vision that fits this film like a glove. Writer Ted Griffin not only makes the story intriguing but the characters as well. Each character in Ocean's Eleven has a significant job that shines with their defined personality. Danny Ocean is a thought-out character and makes for a good lead due to the compelling nature of his history. Rusty and Linus are also great additions to the story as each one has their defining moments where their backstory shines through without taking away from the story. Basher, Saul, Virgil, and Turk were also stand-out characters in the movie. A large part of why these characters were great was because of the outstanding actors that played them. George Clooney is great here as he has this slight humorously craziness to his line delivery that makes his performance so awesome. While Brad Pitt is not doing the most in the movie due to his role, Pitt still shines with his excellent joke delivery and solid facial expressions. Casey Affleck and Scott Caan were hilarious, and their introduction in the recruitment scene makes the rest of their performance stand out amongst the ensemble. Don Cheadle is the only actor I was not feeling. Even though his actions were not poor, his accent was terrible and distracting. Yes, it was not up to Cheadle to make the accent decision, but it is hard to understand why the filmmakers made him do it when it was not working out. The technical elements of Ocean's Eleven are reliable, even though they feel very 2000s. The cinematography from Steven Soderbergh fits with the vibe of the film. Yet, some off filter choices make the film feel a little less grand. The editing also screams 2000s comedy flick, but it works and adds an extra charm to the film. The score from David Holmes is so great. The jazzy, upbeat feel makes Ocean's Eleven feel like a sophisticated yet mischievous adventure, which is the tone set in the film. Ocean's Eleven has a flawless story that takes the heist genre to new heights. Even though there are some slight editing problems and a few cast mishaps, the film never fully gets derailed. Ted Griffin created a stellar story, and Steven Soderbergh brought it to life with an outstanding cast in the best possible way. Read more reviews like this at postcreditreviews.com",

Part of the pleasure is we feel that we're listening in on real conversations and find ourselves leaning forward as though each of us is in on the deal with the characters.\n\nOne problem is there are too many goodies on screen.  It's hard for us to adjust expectations for star turns by the high-wattage cast.  There are so many stars that we don't get to spend enough time with any of them.  Elliott Gould and Carl Reiner are magnificent in small roles and a couple of young TV stars drop by for a slyly hilarious cameo.  Brad Pitt turns in a performance of effortless charm, subtle and witty, completely in service to the character and the movie and yet completely movie star mesmerizing.",

The swanky and swagger filled remake stars a litany of stars: George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Casey Affleck, Julia Roberts, Elliot Gould, Scott Caan and Carl Reiner. Within the main stars there's also a bunch of famous cameos as well. Its a film for people that love ensembles and a film that does justice to the idea of big star cast films. The story follow Danny Ocean as he brings a team of highly trained people to help him get revenge against Terry Benedict, who stole his wife from him when he went to jail. His target, 160 million dollars. How the team prepares and eventually pulls off the heist leads to an amazing 2 hours of fun. And that's exactly what this film is, fun! Its a blast to watch the stars in this movie, as they all seem to be having a great time working together and sharing the screen together. The Las Vegas surroundings really help the film pull off its swanky look and really makes the heist feel even more epic. David Holmes's jazz infused score gives the film a very throwback feel within a modern context. And as for the heist itself, its one of the best, if not best, to have ever been conceived in film. Loads of fun and a movie that will never bore you, Ocean's Eleven is the ultimate star studded heist film.",

Nothing felt like it was over the top or impossible and I was glad to say that it surprised me in a lot of ways. I really enjoyed Brad Pitts character as well as the acrobat character who has one of the coolest tasks in the film. The movie was a suave and stylish heist film that was pretty basic but was also a two way heist. A heist of 150 Mil and a heist of love and I loved how they left it open to interpretation as to whether or not Danny was in it for the money or only cared about winning back his wife. Either way it had a fun sense of humor and a contained story that tied everything into a perfect not with suspense, intelligence, and a crafted plot that makes it easy to go back and watch again or leave on in the background. That being said on your first watch you have to be paying close attention to every bit of dialogue and every scene because if you miss something you won't get the pay off for it later. That's something that makes the movie special, nothing is without its purpose. Every character stands out and each has a unique personality or skill that comes in handy at some point or another. The villain feels competent and doesn't feel like he's an idiot he just got out played by the smarter man Danny Ocean who plays his slick charismatic criminal mastermind to a T and never breaks the mold of his character once. He never unravels he is always cool, calm, and collective while maintaining a sense of humor and a likeable personality. All and all I think I missed a lot of details because the movie is just imbedded with them and sometimes I just don't hear or don't get what they are saying so this is diffidently worth a re watch and I think if anyone watches it enough times they can get a newfound appreciation for the extreme amount of thought that it feels like the film put in. I would love to watch the sequels as well since I already have seen Oceans 8 which was also amazing. This movie also feels like a stamp on the era it is from in the history of film which gives it a very specific vibe that adds the stories feeling of importance. While not the best movie ever it feels like a jazzy and more intelligent mission impossible with colorful characters, well thought plot and story detail, and themes that make it somewhat of a love story but for a mastermind thief. Its creative, it feels fresh, and I would recommend it for anyone with the patients and ability to appreciate a story with more thought and detail then your average blockbuster nowadays.",

In order to get me behind the criminal protagonist, it needs to be overly complex, but not complicated, and there needs to be an alternative motive, such as \"get the girl\".\n\nThis entire franchise does a decent job of this, keeping the motives and implementations interesting.  Part of the problem with that is that because of how complex the heist is, have the movie is an explanation of how the heist is going to happen (with JUST enough information left out for misdirects), then there is the actual heist, with some misdirects, and an explanation of the gaps, if not the heist itself, then a resolution.\n\nThat's the formula for every heist movie ever, which is part of what makes it boring.  It has to be special to really grab a audience and make it memorable.\n\nThis movie does all this with a great cast, and certainly enough production value.  While it is certainly really interesting and entertaining, I can't really say its a great movie.  We can chalk it up as personal bias, but I do think everyone should see this version as it has some historical value and is well worth the watch.",

            "content": "2001's Ocean's Eleven saw independent filmmaker Soderbergh turn in a star-studded Hollywood blockbuster which is neither as deep nor as meaningful as much of his previous output and isn't as experimental either. A remake of Lewis Milestone's 1960 Rat Pack vehicle Ocean's 11, it is however, slick, funny, enormously entertaining and a massive critical and financial success.\nThe story concerns eponymous conman Danny Ocean (played with charisma by George Clooney) paroled from prison and immediately planning an enormously ambitious heist with help from a few colleagues, chief amongst them his old friend \"Rusty\" Ryan (and equally charismatic Brad Pitt). As with all good heist movies, the fun lies in witnessing the planning and execution of the heist and with various problems and obstacles arising (but not really), the plot has plenty of delightful twists and surprises on route to the predictable success of the venture. Equally, a personal dimension is added by Danny's desire to win back his ex-wife from the main antagonist Terry Benedict and his schemes for achieving this intertwine with the heist.\nThe screenplay is often very funny, for example during Frank Catton's handshake scene with a car dealer (Bernie Mac makes use of his comic skills again when he's accusing Matt Damon's Linus Caldwell of racism) and the actors all deliver their often deadpan dialogue perfectly. The star studded cast is excellent, with Clooney and Pitt joined by a host of familiar faces including Matt Damon, Julia Roberts, Elliott Gould, Carl Reiner and Casey Affleck, all perfectly cast. Andy Garcia exudes power and menace as Benedict. The only oddity here is the strange Mockney accent that Don Cheadle adopts as Basher, marring an otherwise highly entertaining performance. Additionally, the film includes several actors and sportsmen playing themselves, which roots the film in reality, even though in the case of the five actors learning to play poker, they portray themselves as slightly tongue-in-cheek slow studies. Not for the first (or last) time Soderbergh casts a non-professional actor in a prominent role, in this case acrobat Shaobo Qin as the Amazing Zen.\nWhilst Ocean's Eleven feels much more mainstream that Soderbergh's previous films, he still brings his own distinctive touches to the film. This is immediately obvious during Danny's parole board hearing, a scene in which the camera focuses entirely on George Clooney, with the parole board members unseen; as a means of introducing Danny, it tells us most of what we need to know about him with great economy. Soderbergh's fondness for Steadicam and tracking shots is evident, especially during the scenes in the casino, and there are numerous flourishes: when Elliott Gould's Reuben recalls three almost successful Vegas casino robberies, each is seen filmed in the style of the era in which it occurred. An assortment of amusing vignettes introduces the various members of the \"Eleven\" and two of them segue into the present: when Danny and Rusty discuss Basher, he is said to be potentially unavailable. The film then cuts to him involved in a bank robbery that goes wrong and no sooner is he arrested that Rusty appears to rescue him. Similarly, when Dell is introduced, his first scene is followed by him wandering into the background of a deep focus shot that has Danny and Rusty talking in the foreground. Typically for Soderbergh, the soundtrack – by David Holmes – is an almost constant presence and it perfectly suits the setting and the story. \nOcean's Eleven only marked a detour into mainstream movie making for Soderbergh rather than a new direction: he has continued to make experimental films since. In a sense, this foray was an experiment in itself, as he took on the challenge of making a glossy, stylish star vehicle in the same vein as Wiseman's original and made it in an enormous success. Given his track record, that isn't terribly surprising.",

The movie provides an engaging two hours that develops in exactly the manner one would expect from this sort of production. The storyline, while certainly not a masterpiece of plotting (there are numerous holes, some of which are rather large), offers enough to keep audiences guessing and to inject a little tension into an otherwise harmless and lightweight enterprise. There are also sufficient moments of comedy to maintain an upbeat tone. And, of course, there are plenty of familiar faces, starting with Clooney and Brad Pitt in the lead roles, and going all the way down to Julia Roberts in a rare supporting performance. Unmissable work by the always reliable Soderberg. ",

            "content": "A meticulously planned heist for the ages!\n\nSteven Soderbergh simply directed the most fun heist film ever made with Ocean's Eleven (2001). It's a silly movie, but always entertaining. The coolest aspect is that the entire film is set-up for the heist that is carried out right before your eyes, so that every detail out in the open for you to enjoy. The writing is really funny and clever as each character is written uniquely with a specific personality and joke style. The overall heist is carried out in such vivid detail that the writing is actually quite smart in its meticulous nature.\n\nSoderbergh is a phenomenal director, who patient style lets conversations breathe and action fly by, creating a fast pace for Ocean's Eleven like few heist movies can compare. This movie is apparently 117 minutes, but it only feels like 30 or so as you are swept away by funny comedy scenarios and ridiculous heist setbacks that always makes me laugh. I've seen Ocean's Eleven at least 10 times now and it never gets old. \n\nFurthermore, Soderbergh ends Ocean's Eleven with a beautiful cathartic scene in front of the Las Vegas fountain and a killer sideways panning shot of each character remaining. Their looks of accomplishment makes you feel proud for these wicked men of no morals, but a code among their fellow thieves. Soderbergh cuts quickly from hands, eyes, cards, chips, safes, suits, and any number of intriguing objects for a neatly engaging heist film. Ocean's Eleven is so properly constructed that it's like one long scene that you do not leave your suspense until the last scene.\n\nGeorge Clooney leads this pack of eccentric criminals as the heist's mastermind. His suave charm and effortless cool persona makes you like Clooney immediately. He was born to play Danny Ocean and that's all that needs to be said. Brad Pitt is hilarious as the quick talking crook Rusty, who must always be eating on camera. It's so fun to look for whatever Pitt is eating next. He's charismatic and relatable for a larger than life criminal figure. I should mention Julia Roberts is lovely as the love interest Tess, Danny Ocean's ex-wife. She's stern and unforgiving as Tess with an alluring presence all the same. I like how Roberts plays Tess as a woman sure of her feelings.\n\nCarl Reiner is sincerely funny as the con artist Saul. Matt Damon is excellent as the nervous new guy Linus, who doubles as a skillful pickpocket. Andy Garcia is perfectly detestable as a millionaire casino owner named Terry Benedict. Bernie Mac is outrageous as the inside man Frank. Don Cheadle's explosives expert Basher is funny for his spark of comedy genius and his absolutely over the top British accent. I love the scene when he sets off their team's EMP charge. Casey Affleck is funny as the argumentative remote control driver Virgil. Scott Caan is wonderful as Affleck's foil named Turk. Caan's comedy timing is just a funny alongside Affleck's sensitive character. Elliott Gould is aptly cast as the rich financier Reuben for the whole heist. Eddie Jemison is great as the sweaty tech expert with a smart mouth called Livingston. Lastly, the highly flexible acrobat Shaobo Qin is astounding as the magnificently dazzling Yen. He gets some of the most memorable lines in Ocean's Eleven.\n\nIn all, there has never been a heist film is oddly entertaining as Ocean's Eleven. It's not a classic heist art film like Michael Mann's Heat, but Steven Soderbergh brings a levity and class for a deliriously pleasant movie.",

That being said, it has its flaws. Julia Robert's character arc is rushed and even thought the heist itself is witty there are aspects that don't make sense upon close inspection. None of that is enough to keep this from being one of the most fun heist movies ever put to film. \n\nClosest comparison: It's the casino heist movie by which all others are measured.\n\nSetting: Heist\nPlot: Heist\nTone: Comedy",

Since then there have been three more Oceans movies including:  Oceans Twelve, Oceans Thirteen, Oceans 8 but I think the original movie is the best. Firstly, because Oceanâ(TM)s Eleven has good actors.  Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Matt Damon Julia Roberts and Don Cheadle are very good in the film. Career criminals Danny Ocean (Clooney) and Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) get together to plan a heist at three casinos owned by Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia). They put together a team of eleven people and hope to steal $150 million. \n\nâSo, Danny starts to hire professionals from all over the country: There's the card magician Rusty Ryan, the perfect pickpocket Linus Caldwell and the ingenious pyrotechnician Basher Tarr. Reuben Tishkoff, who lost a casino to Benedict, provides funding, the brothers Virgil and Turk Malloy will drive and help, and Frank Catton, a professional card dealer, gets a job at the casino to watch the routines. Saul Bloom, already retired, will play the rich heavy weaponry dealer and live in the hotel, while Livingston Dell bugs the place to have a look over the shoulders of the security personnel. Finally, the chinese acrobat artist Yen will be the one to move inside the safe before the motion detectors are turned off. There are three rules to be followedâ?\nWhat could possibly go wrong????\nMatt Damon was very good as Linus Caldwell (why)",

This is a remake of an older film featuring a bunch of stud criminals who decide to swindle a Las Vegas casino. Ocean's 11 is fun and light hearted. There are moments of suspension of disbelief, but one must ignore them to truly enjoy the film. All the actors from Pitt, Clooney and Damon to Elliot Gould and Bernie Mac seem to be having a great time both on and off the screen.

One boring day, I decided to watch and I had very low expectations. After watching it, I HAD A BLAST... at the film's 2nd and 3rd acts.\n\nActs 2 & 3 - FUN AND SMART! The planning and execution of the heist was a brilliant ride from act 2's start to act 3's end. These acts were near-perfection! (Some parts were slightly boring)\n\nACT 1 - The film has a lot of supporting characters which, sadly, meant a lot of dragged and sometimes uninteresting introductions to said characters. If act 1 was the entire film, I'd give \"Ocean's Eleven\" 2 stars. Thankfully, it's not.\n\nNOTE: Though the character introductions were too long and, at times, uninteresting, the actors did their best. Their on-screen charisma made these scenes slightly better.\n\nI still have one more flaw with this film: Julia Roberts' character. Despite her amazing performance, her character was just a plot device for Danny Ocean. Yes, a plot device is important but when a character is a plot device, the film shouldn't make you feel that said character IS a plot device.\n\nOverall, I had a blast with \"Ocean's Eleven!\"",

You'd be hard pressed to find a better two men to lead something like this than George Clooney (Danny) and Brad Pitt (Rusty). They're both so charismatic and play off each other tremendously. Matt Damon (Linus) is great and possibly steals the show in this one. There's also top notch work from folks like Don Cheadle (Basher), Bernic Mac (Frank) and Andy Garcia (Terry). Typically, in a good heist film, the actual robbery is the best part. While it's good here, the highlight is seeing everything get set up and watching the pieces fall into place. The characters interact so well that I could've watched an entire film of just them putting the heist together. The film is well written, with sharp, witty dialogue. I've gone on record to state that I'm not a fan of Soderbergh flicks, but this series is the exception. It's well directed and he just gets what to do with characters.\n\nWeaknesses: Parts of the movie seem to drag and it ultimately ends up feeling like it lasts longer than two hours. I also couldn't get into the Tess (Julia Roberts) character. I completely understood her point in the film and she's a big driving force behind Danny's plan. I just never felt any real connection or chemistry with her and Clooney. Also, while it makes sense for her to leave Terry after hearing what he said, she goes back to Danny, which feels out of character. It doesn't seem like Danny does enough to be deserving of that kind of redemption from his jilted ex.\n\nOverall: This is just such a cool movie. Almost all the characters are enjoyable in some form, they're stylish and witty, making for a good time. The heist itself is cool and the setup for it is great. Throw in some great acting, writing, and directing and you've got a winner.",

            "content": "The 2001 star-studded \"Ocean's Eleven\" features blockbuster names on a grandiose Las-Vegas scene. The heist genre has great potential and often a tendency to be predictable and cliche but Steven Soderbergh really delivers. The characters introduction left me confused initially. What does this gymnast have anything to do with breaking into one of the most secure vaults in existence? Why am I watching brothers race a truck beside a remote control car? These questions weren't answered until much later in the film but the payoff for patience was huge. The way Soderbergh brought the characters together so fluidly impressed me. Fast pace, split second timing and cleverly worded dialogue kept me enticed before everything came together to make sense.\n I've never been fond of the love stories in the majority of films, I find them corny and over used. Initially I was disappointed to find out that Ocean's Eleven like most other films incorporated a \"love story\" into the mix. But Clooney kept his cool demeanor and Soderbergh puts the spotlight on his charm really playing to his strengths. The triangle in which romance was structured (Clooney, Roberts, and Garcia) added to the film further encouraging me to root for the team executing the heist even though they're supposed to be the \"bad guys.\" I think the viewer is supposed to not like Terry, the owner of the casinos. He's the target. Arrogant, wealthy, seemingly untouchable, and he has the girl. It's implied a few different times that Ocean is not satisfied with her relationship with Terry. This is especially apparent when Terry rejects Beatrice's attempt to kiss him, because cameras were watching. Roberts responds by glaring at the floor as her body language reads disappointment. Roberts dissatisfaction foreshadows that Clooney will emerge victorious is winning her back. I didn't care for the ending in which Pitt and Clooney walk out to the car after Clooney exits jail to Roberts in the backseat of his car. I felt like the extravagant movie had a rushed ending that fell into the usual, protagonist wins the girl. \nBrad Pitt does what Brad Pitt does in movies, eat. Matt Damons character is made to look almost like the younger brother to Pitt and Clooney. They don't allow him to do some of the dirty work like participate in the robbery in which they get the device that shuts down the power. Don Cheadle was exceptional and funny. \"We're in Barney...rubble...trouble!\" Stuck out as a clever scene in my head and sort of represents the word play throughout the film. Another scene, Roberts confronts Clooney and says \"You're a thief and a liar\" Clooney responds \"I don't do that anymore\" Roberts \"Steal?\" Clooney \"Lie.\"\nThe creative character development, the sleek and cool feel, the wit, and even the playlist all intertwined perfectly and left me very impressed. Soderbergh was a maestro with film. I don't watch a lot of movies but Ocean's Eleven is certainly one I did enjoy and have watched more than once I look forward to writing on this film in more depth and detail.",

From seeing the other movies of the series, this movie is the best one out of all of them. The plot is more simple and restrained than both of them, and it's more clever also. The cast are great and it really fits to the film, although I heard a lot about how Don Cheadle's accent is one of the worst accents in a film. Now I actually thought that it was fine, but it's definitely not a legit one though. It's really smart, and it has snappy dialogue from the script by Ted Griffin. It develops the Ocean crew a lot that we know what they are, and what their function is that's relevant to robbing the casino. It's got some twists that I was really shocked at and really liked.

            "content": "\"Ocean's Eleven\" is an average movie that looks and feels like it's something special - gaze upon it only a few minutes into its running time and you'll find yourself not only in the presence of George Clooney and Brad Pitt, but also of Matt Damon, Julia Roberts, Andy García, Don Cheadle, Carl Reiner, Casey Affleck, and Elliott Gould.  Stars are everywhere we turn; decadence marks every corner; glamour, fun, style, penetrates the areas.  The suspense is a dash exuberant, the comedy easygoing.  It all seems so novel.  But it isn't.\n\tThe effortless fizziness of \"Ocean's Eleven\" is all Steven Soderbergh, Hollywood's most chameleonic director (he's jumped from \"sex, lies, and videotape\" [talky] to \"Erin Brockovich\" [crowd-pleasing] to \"The Girlfriend Experience\" [indie fluff]).  To him, making a film as luxuriously beguiling as this one is a piece of cake - and, being the skilled filmmaker he is, he does it much better than anyone else in the field could ever manage.  \n\tMost directors for hire would let the sizable cast, along with just the right screenwriter, do all the work.  But Soderbergh, also cinematographer, is more than game to take the material to primal caper levels; the film doesn't just go through the motions.  \"Ocean's Eleven\" is escapism with just enough intelligence, pizazz, and cool (did I mention star power?) to make it a blockbuster worth savoring, not passing aside.  We forget it's a remake because it's better than the remake.\n\tYou might have heard the story by now.  Following his release from prison, career criminal Danny Ocean (Clooney) finds himself in the mood to execute the heist of his career, and takes it upon himself to empty the financial structures of Las Vegas's Bellagio, The Mirage, and the MGM Grand casinos.  He'll never be able to pull it off, we cackle with a wink, because maybe he can do it.  \n\tHe pitches the idea to his right-hand man, the acute Rusty Ryan (Pitt), who likes, but is perhaps slightly afraid of, the plot.  They then go to veteran security expert Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould) for the greenlight (he hesitantly says yes), and so goes the process of finding the perfect team to undergo the job.  You might guess that the number of those included comes to a sharp eleven.\n\tWith much preparation and a near foolproof blueprint to boot, Ocean's ambition just may pay off.  But his confidence might go out of whack when he finds out that the manager of the casinos, Terry Benedict (García), is in a relationship with his ex-wife (Roberts), whom he still has feelings for.\n\tJaw-dropping intrigue ensues within the walls of \"Ocean's Eleven's\" quick-moving 117 minutes; its sophistication and wit rivals that of \"Topkapi,\" \"How to Steal a Million,\" and \"The Italian Job.\" This is fast, smooth, and dangerous entertainment, fat in all the right places, taut when it needs to be.  And it is, perhaps, among the best uses of an ensemble for blockbuster means in the history of film - is there anything better than seeing our favorite actors come together in a well-made movie, eliciting a chemistry that suggests they've been friends for decades? It's pleasurable in the most shallow of ways.  \n\tThe heists aren't too shabby, either.  Elaborately staged and choreographed with just enough comic relief, they dazzle almost as much as the stars that stalk the premises.\n\tSo while you may not be remembering the ins-and-outs of \"Ocean's Eleven\" a week after initial viewing, it isn't a bad way to spend a couple of hours.  We're in the company of artistic professionals having a good time, and the aura is infectious.  Akin to a roller coaster ride, the film is predictable in a forgivable way - I'll be damned if it isn't a fine adventure.",

So many heist films have been released with a various numbers of cliches and none can repacture the brilliance that Ocean's Eleven gave. Everyone in the film does fantastic with an all star cast including George Clooney, Bradd Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle and much more. They all work so well together and you can buy the the group feels like a proper team. All captured so well by the smart, hilarious and brilliant script put into the film where everything makes sense and nothing falls apart from the plot when you think about it. This film just keeps getting better and better as it goes and the film getting so interesting and exciting when Geogre Clooney is talking to the group of all the conflicts that are found during the robbery and some parts of the plan start to fall apart giving more tension to the heist and excitement. Just the jazzy style that this film has with it's transitions, funky soundtrack and the fact that this film is hilarious which is a bonus. Steven Soderberch does a brilliant job at directing and setting that fun and wicked tone to this flick. To this day, Ocean's Eleven remains one of my favorite movies ever and my favorite heist movie ever. The acting is great, the comedy is hilarious. The film keeps getting better as it goes keeping the interest, excitment and fun, wity tone. This is not just a brilliant and histerical heist flick, but a film with characters that we can relate to and all feel like human beings interacting with each other and how well they work together. Ocean's Eleven is a masterpiece that will forever remain a classic on how this film changed the heist genre forever. No heist flick has ever been close to beating the original and genius Ocean's Eleven.\n\nRating: 99% and an A++++",

I found nothing at all in this movie that was even remotely entertaining. The gizmos and devices and situations were cliche. The EMP device was just silly and the script in places even more so. The music was ripped from previous movies of that genera. Try to watch this again and not think of the Pink Panther films. Certainly the sets were grand but that is really all this had going for it. It was hardly \"action packed\" but dragged in places. Threatening to blow up the money (shades of Goldfinger) is just rot as it would be replaced by the Treasury Department. Certainly the twist about getting into the vault was fun but not believable except for the scene of where they descended the shaft. How exactly was that necessary but to fool the audience? This movie is proof once again that no one will ever go broke by underestimating the intelligence of the public.",

I remember asking my dad, \"so these are the bad guys?\" His response was along the lines of \"well, they may be stealing something but they're still the good guys.\" I still liked the movie as a kid, but this concept confused me a little bit. Many years later, it is still a delightful B movie to watch.\n\nIt is pretty awesome that they have so many people on their team to create an ensemble cast, but some of them get barely any screen time when I would want to see an equal balance of the cast. For example, all we know about the little acrobat is that he is really good at what he does since he doesn't speak much English, besides dropping the second use of \"f***\" in the movie. We also don't delve too deep into the back story of certain characters, such as the oldest member on the team. We know all of these guys either have a connection to Ocean or Pitt's character or that they are found, and for this senior citizen we know he has a connection to Pitt's character and that is about it.\n\nThe funniest bits of the film come from the twins, one of whom is played by Casey Affleck, who really gets how annoying his character is supposed to be. One of my favorite parts of the film is when Affleck's character's toy car is going faster than his brother's monster truck just to get destroyed by his brother.\n\nGetting back to the point of the movie, the heist seems to go way too smoothly, which is meant to satisfy the viewers I guess, but a great film requires conflict - no matter if it is external or internal - but this film's struggle seems mainly to be internal struggles within Ocean and his enemy played by Andy Garcia. One is trying to win his ex- wife back, and the other is dying inside as his money is getting stolen. As Brad Pitt's character points out, it is really selfish of Ocean to concoct this plan with some motivation to win Tess back. Romance makes a good subplot in movies - in fact a lot of producers want at least some type of romance in their movies - and while it holds up and illustrates that Ocean is a better man than Garcia's character, but it seems to stray from the focus on the rest of the team.\n\nWhile watching this my friends were pointing out how gadgets in this movie go unexplained, especially for a film released in 2001 where this type of technology wasn't even in many James Bond films. Each step of the plan seems to go almost too well, with the exception that they almost blow the acrobat away.\n\nThis is an enjoyable heist film that makes us feel for Ocean, but I wish there was more connection to the other characters in the film.",

            "content": "Veteran director Steven Soderbergh seems to approach this big budget remake with a sort of \"piece-of-cake\" confidence-and it just works.  With a repertoire of well-received experimental and independent films, Soderbergh succeeds in converting his elegant style into this adaptation of the 1960 Rat Pack film.  Instead of Sinatra, Soderbergh has Clooney, and a whole ensemble of big-wig actors who perform with precision.  Though not likely to champion the awards circuit, Ocean's Eleven is a well-executed crowd pleaser with enough individuality to stand the test of time.\n\nAs the film opens, Danny Ocean (George Clooney) is being addressed by a panel of social workers to decide whether or not he should be released after four years in prison.  The camera doesn't stray from Clooney's face as he lies through his teeth that he will no longer be involved in criminal activity.  As David Holmes' score fades in, the bouncy heist-flick mood is created almost instantly and already I am wondering where the next two hours will take me.\n\nThough some points in this film feel forced (Ocean orchestrating a 150,000,000 dollar heist to win back his ex-wife from a Las Vegas casino tycoon?), these are merely staples of the heist genre.  High stakes, impossible odds, and a determined team of eleven eccentric masterminds are all typical elements of a Hollywood heist-flick, but ones necessary to the success of this film.  Soderbergh's success is visible in the unique nuances that only an experienced filmmaker would be able to provide.  Sophisticated shots and humor in all the right places make it easy to sit back and watch the slew of montages that are unavoidable in this type of film.  The details of the heist are complicated yet very accessible, lending for a very intriguing narrative.  \n\nJust as each member of Danny Ocean's team plays a specific role in the operation, each actor in the film is present for their own specific reason.  Serious scenes are left to dramatic heavy weights.  George Clooney, Julia Roberts, and Andy Garcia take on the more dramatic themes of the film such as romance and revenge.  Veteran comedy actors Bernie Mac, Elliot Gould, and Carl Reiner act out the comedic counterparts to Danny Ocean's tale of high stakes betrayal.  Mac's fake argument with Matt Damon's character about being black is hysterical.  Elliot Gould is perfect as the ostentatious metrosexual and Carl Reiner kills it as the retired conman who uses his health aliments to his benefit during the heist.  Though the top-billed actors in the film act at the top of their ability, some of the best performances in the film come from the supporting members of the ensemble.  Scott Caan (son of James Caan) and Casey Affleck (brother of Ben Affleck) are hilarious as competitive twin brother mechanics and Eddie Jemison fits the \"nervous nerdy hacker\" archetype perfectly.  Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, and Don Cheadle complete the cast, bringing brilliant performances, during both the comedic and dramatic moments of the film.\n\nOf course, this film has its flaws.  Because of its formulaic structure, the film fails to develop nearly all of its characters.  Danny Ocean is funny, charming, and daring, but only as the archetype that he was written to fill.  With the exception of Julia Roberts' Tess, no other character has a definitive arch-not even the title character.  Roberts probably gives the most traditional dramatic performance.  In response to Ocean asking Tess if her new boyfriend can make her laugh, Roberts coldly replies with the most memorable line of the film:  \"He doesn't make me cry.\"  With that being said, the character of Tess is unjustly forced into the \"wife-of-a-con\" archetype, severely limiting Roberts' range in the role.\n\nViewing this film in context, it is easy to overlook these shortcomings.  As a blockbuster action-comedy, there is not much room for serious development of characters.  Clooney and company give dynamite performances as their respective characters, though none push the boundaries of what would be expected.  The real charm of Soderbergh's film is his ability to use the Hollywood clichés to his advantage, giving them his own breath of air and leaving the audience with a humorous, less predictable interpolation of the traditional heist.  Ocean's Eleven is pure enjoyment.",

There seems to have been some other strange things going on behind the camera. This is mostly seen in the credits where Matt Damon's (a side character) credit comes second (after Clooney) but before Pitt's (a main character and more famous actor). Another credit anomaly is how Don Cheadle is completely uncredited despite the fact that he is one of the more prominent side characters of the film.

There is a lot of well placed humor in the movie that compliments the overall light-hearted feel. \n\nThe cast is stellar, and they all seem to be enjoying themselves under the shooting. The set-up follows a typical heist movie structure, but is nonetheless a joy to watch. There is nothing particularly new about this movie, but everything is still done right and with great style. Do not watch this movie looking for any deep thematic meaning or substance, but enjoy it as a fun, light-hearted, stylish heist movie with great chemistry between its lead cast, and you will be having a very good time.",

It's not action packed, but it keeps you on the edge of your seat. It has a way of making you feel smart when in reality it's quite easy to follow along and not overly-confusing. It's direct and to the point. I saw it at 13 and loved it then. As an adult I enjoy it even more as I get more of the jokes. \n\nI'm a sucker for tongue-in-cheek banter. The dialogue is fun and it keeps the pace moving along nicely even when you're waiting for something to happen. \n\nThe final act is near-perfect with all the motives being revealed, just like turning over a royal flush. Everything came full circle and fit in perfectly like the last piece of a puzzle. \n\nOverall, it's a great movie that everyone should watch. It has a way of making you feel like you have a piece invested in the big con.\n\nTwizard Rating: 96",

Ocean's Eleven is actually a very well thought out and very creative heist film. The heist scene is an absolute blast and never had me wishing that it was over. The heist scene especially is very creative because of all the things that happen. From a fake death to a pretend beat down(you'll understand when you see it) the heist scene will never have you bored. Another great thing about Ocean's Eleven are the characters. The characters are all very memorable and pretty damn likable. My favorite without a doubt were Casey Affleck's character and his brother. Every scene they were in had me laughing. The performances were also great(as expected). The best, I would have to say, was definitely Brad Pitt.

A few good shots here and there were enough to keep this movie exciting and allow the viewer to follow the heist along.\n\nThe romance sub plot was where this movie falls flat. There was little reason for Tess to make the choice she did in the end. \n\nA few over sites in terms of reality are present, but that's not a huge issue.

Based off the original film by Harry Brown and Charles Lederer, Ocean's Eleven follows Danny Ocean's release from prison, and bringing a team together to rob three casinos that total up to $150,000,000 (The Bellagio, The Mirage, and the MGM Casino).  There is no denying the entertainment present in the picture, ranging from the high-tech crime, preparations, and the real heist itself, which interestingly, the audience never knows how it plays out, which leaves them surprised.  Those elements (the heist mostly) are undeniably entertaining throughout, and the crime actually connects to the heist, unlike many generic crime films today.  The film also has tons of laughs and smart action to keep audiences at the edge of their seats cheering it laughing their guys out.  Steven Soderbergh is great at capturing a funny, tense, and thrilling film, and also does an amazing job as cinematographer, giving excellent shots for each scene.  Ted Griffin crafts an excellent script that perfectly goes along with the story by George C. Johnson and Jack Golden Russell.  The acting is also great, especially George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, and Julia Roberts.  Clooney is great at portraying Ocean, a smart, calm, and manipulative criminal, while Pitt is great as Rusty, Ocean's right-hand man.  Damon is also great as Linus, the inexperienced pickpocket that's full of talent, and Roberts as Tess Ocean, Danny's ex-wife, and married to the owner of three casinos he's robbing, Terry Benedict, played by Andy Garcia.  A must-see, and one of the best remakes of all time.",

It was the Channel 9 Movie a few years ago, and I started to watch it because, as you know, I prefer to watch original versions of things first.  However, while I've seen Frank Sinatra show some serious acting talent, it wasn't on display in his Rat Pack movies.  And Dean Martin was never an actor.  Yeah, he did a couple of John Wayne movies, but that doesn't mean he could act.  That's a whole separate list--people in John Wayne movies who couldn't act.  Anyway, for one reason and another, I distinctly remember turning the movie off after about ten or fifteen minutes.  Graham says we got halfway through.  Either way, this is that rarest of films--a remake that's actually better than the original.  I suppose it helps to start with a film that's more a gimmick than a story.  It's not hard to improve on that.\r\n\r\nDanny Ocean (George Clooney) has just gotten out of prison.  His plan for what to do afterward?  Rob the three Las Vegas casinos that are run by Terry Benedict (that fine actor Andy Garcia).  All three of them share a vault, and Danny figures that he can put together a crew to break the vault and make off with well over a hundred million dollars, if he times it right.  To that end, he first hooks up with his former business partner, Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt).  They get their venture bankrolled by Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould), who has been essentially overthrown by Benedict.  They also recruit explosives expert Basher Tarr (Don Cheadle), acrobat Yen (Shabobo Qin), grifter Saul Bloom (Carl Reiner), car experts Virgil (Casey Affleck) and Turk (Scott Caan) Malloy, insider Frank Catton (Bernie Mac), tech guy Livingston Dell (Eddie Jemison), and pickpocket Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon).  A minor kink is thrown into the plan when it turns out that Benedict is involved with one Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts), Danny's ex-wife.\r\n\r\nThat's also, I suppose, the hazard of basing your movie off a Rat Pack original.  There aren't a lot of women in this movie.  Oh, Angie Dickinson, who was Bea Ocean in the original, gets a cameo, along with Eydie Gormé.  However, Tess is the only female character to get a name, not a description or \"as herself.\"  So yeah.  I get a little tired of this; there's this odd assumption that movies with women as characters are more for women than for men, but movies with men as characters are more universal.  I suppose we let them get away with this, because we will keep going to those movies regardless.  I mean, what else are we going to do?  Stay home?  I do think that one or two of the characters could have been made female with no real damage to the story, especially given that several of the characters start blending together after a while.  Still, two of the three people on Danny's parole board are female, which I suppose is something.  The movie is just working with what it's got.\r\n\r\nOh, the story is ridiculous.  I mean, leaving aside all the other ways it's ridiculous, the amount of money they're supposed to be removing from the vault is probably literally a ton.  Assuming all the bills are hundreds, which is of course a ridiculous assumption, we're looking at about twenty pounds per million.  (At least according to a quick minute's Google searching.)  I found a thing online that shows that one hundred million dollars in hundred-dollar bills will fill a shipping pallet to about the height of a person, and the vault is said to hold about, what, one hundred sixty million?  The math doesn't work.  The movie relies on our complete lack of ability to understand numbers that big.  I mean, that's fine; the only thing we can currently make that would produce the EMP that's so important to the story is a nuclear bomb, and we go along with that, too.  I just think it's funny that people worry about how they got the fliers in and don't consider how they got the money out.\r\n\r\nThis is obviously not a movie you would watch for the plot.  There is one, but it's extremely silly.  Mostly, what we are doing is watching some of the Sexiest Men Alive gambol about Las Vegas.  (And there would probably be a fourth, if the \"award\" had been given in the '70s and not started in 1985 with Mel Gibson.  Also, Casey Affleck's brother got it in 2002.)  In the next movie, which of course I've not yet seen, we throw in yet another of the Sexiest Women Alive.  (Not that [i]People[/i] seems to keep track of that.  And I do hope the woman in question is doing better; I understand her bipolar has been acting up.)  I think it's also supposed to be encouraging us to visit Scenic Las Vegas, though it would take an awful lot more than this to get me interested.  Then again, I suspect most people watching this movie weren't thinking about how much water evaporates off the Bellagio fountains every day and how much that water could be used for something beneficial instead.",

            "content": "Ocean's Eleven is a remake of a Rat Pack 1960 movie of the same name that starred Frank Sinatra. This movie is just graceful, that is the word. It features one of the greatest ensemble cast that you can find and having them come together for one purpose and one purpose only to take down a casino. And the merging of these talents was well done by Steven Soderbergh, who was the director and cinematographer of the movie.\n\nDaniel Ocean and his crew made robbing a casino look easy, since all you need is some background cash and a crew of different people with unique skills. If you have these people in your back pocket then you, \"the robber\" are game enough to take down anybody.\n\nSteven Soderbergh and Clooney came together with the aim of putting this film together and after the wonderful display of acting from all the cast, let's not forget Julia Robert and Andy Garcia were also in this movie, the movie was well received and led to a trilogy.\n\nThe movie is about Danny Ocean (George Clooney), who just got out of jail and the first thing on his mind is to perform the perfect steal. After Danny got out he started to recruit the team members for his heist, they were:\n\nIn order of recruitment:\n1.\t George Clooney as Danny Ocean\n2.\tBernie Mac as Frank Catton\n3.\tBrad Pitt as Rusty Ryan\n4.\tlliott Gould as Reuben Tishkoff\n5.\tCasey Affleck as Virgil Malloy\n6.\tScott Caan as Turk Malloy\n7.\tEddie Jemison as Livingston Dell\n8.\tDon Cheadle as Basher Tarr\n9.\tShaobo Qin as \"The Amazing\" Yen\n10.\tCarl Reiner as Saul Bloom\n11.\tMatt Damon as Linus Caldwell\n\nThe job looked impossible but Danny believed they could do it, so together they formed the master plan to take on the Bellagio, The Mirage, and the MGM Grand casinos, these casinos were owned by Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia).\n\nThere is also a catch to this heist; Danny's Ex-Wife (Julia Roberts) is now going out with Benedict.\n\nThis movie was extremely popular and the movie grew from just a fun movie to watch, to having a huge fan base that led to the release of two other Ocean crew movies that also had the same cast from here and featured new popular cast. This movie cost nothing less than $85 million to make, due majorly to the cast, but it made its money back and over in the box office and it stands as the best of all the three in the franchise.\n\nMy favorite take from the movie is that 50% of the time when Brad Pitt is on screen he is eating something.\n\nwww.lagsreviews.com",

It is obvious the actors had fun with this and so did I to a certain extent.

            "content": "This is a very good movie, with an awesome cast.  This film was fast paced even at the slow parts, and really entertaining.  Danny Ocean gets out of prison and gets ten men together to rob a casino of well over 100 million dollars.  The whole film is about how they plan to do the heist, and they build up how impossible it is to do.  There is   a scene where Danny Ocean goes over the plan, which sounds almost impossible to do, and he says it like it's nothing.  Which is just an awesome scene.\r\n\r\nIt is kind of your typical guys casino, or heist film, but better.  The poker scenes are like the scenes in Matt Damon's other good film Rounder's.  The film has the same film feel that all gambling films, and casino movies have that make them so entertaining.  The guys in the movies always talk to each other in a certain way, which makes them sound really cool.  That is true with this film, they are all really cool.  George Clooney was the coolest for sure.  Brad Pitt brought the same cool guy performance he played in Fight Club to this film, and once again proved how underrated he is.\r\n\r\nDanny Ocean also has a personal vendetta with the heist he is trying to pull off.  His wife left him after he was sent to prison, and now she is with the man who runs the casino.  He is robbing his casino not only for money but also to defeat the man with his ex wife.  Andy Garcia played that man.  Andy Garcia was what Robert DeNiro as in Casino, in this film.  The guy who ran the big Casino in Las Vegas.  Ocean does win his wife back too.  It was a total in your face job by Danny Ocean.  \r\n\r\nThe robbery scene is awesome.  It is brilliant the way they pull it off.  It worked perfectly.  Everything went exactly to plan.  They even caused a citywide blackout, which was awesome.  They really thought it all out well.  In the two weeks leading up to their epic heist, they are checking everything out in the casino, and figuring out the ways to figure it all out.  They also have a lot of good dialogue, and funny lines.\r\n\r\nThe music in this film also adds to the entertainment.  It's the type of stuff you hear in films like Dirty Harry, Goodfellas, and James Bond.  The funky rock, blues, and jazz music should be in all films like this.  It makes the film way better.  Music, and movies are my two big pations, so I like it when they have good use of music in movies, which this film really did.  I loved this movie all around.",

The film is about eleven men who plan a massive heist/robbery on a vault containing 150 million dollars hidden underneath a Las Vegas casino. Their plan is pretty much foolproof and just shows you how much thought the screenwriter put into this film. This isn't your typical heist or even action film; it's smart and knows exactly what it's doing every step of the way. My favorite scene is at the end: I won't say exactly what it is, since that would completely give the ending away, but the soothing song \"Clair de Lune\" plays, which makes for a really great scene that rewards the viewer. I'm not a fan of Steven Soderbergh's other work, and in fact I think he's quite overrated, but this film proved me wrong about him. This is a fine film that thoroughly entertains from beginning to end.",

Directed by Steven Soderbergh, it follows the story of Danny Ocean; a man who immediately after being released from prison is going to attempt to steal $160 million from big shot casino owner Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia).\n\n        Basically, Oceanâ(TM)s Eleven is simply a load of rollicking fun.  Because while itâ(TM)s not enthralling and it will not have you perched on the edge of your seat, gripping the sofa whilst you stress over the safety of the characters that you have come to love.  No.  That just doesnâ(TM)t happen in this film.  Soderbergh doesnâ(TM)t want this to happen, because he does a magnificent job making it very enjoyable and also rather reminiscent of The Italian Job; thanks to upbeat and enjoyable jazz in the background throughout the film.   \n\n         The performances arenâ(TM)t gripping, nor are they enchanting.  But they do not need to be because, Iâ(TM)ve said it before and Iâ(TM)ll say it again, Oceanâ(TM)s Eleven is pure fun, with the occasional heart-pounding moment.  Yet the film is also very clever and smart.  It is, much like The Italian Job, very satisfactory and you cannot watch on without cracking a wide smile.  A smart and satisfactory casino robbery, some nice direction and interesting dialogue that keeps you on your feet, there isnâ(TM)t much you can fault this film.\n\n        Yet this film isnâ(TM)t completely faultless, because the inclusion of a woman driving Danny Ocean on perceives me, making it feel a bit tacky.  Also, the lack of chemistry between Clooney and Roberts is rather unbelievable.  I also felt that while it is fun and it is satisfactory you do think that it doesnâ(TM)t offer much.  Finally, Don Cheadleâ(TM)s truly awful cockney accent.  It is so bad in fact that I wanted to mute the television every time he spoke.\n\n        Ultimately, this film is very enjoyable.  A film that everyone can enjoy, a film that is fun and makes you want to watch again and again.  If youâ(TM)re looking for a dramatic heist thriller, look elsewhere, but if youâ(TM)re just looking for a bit of fun on a Sunday night, this film is just what you need.",

The characters seem to do nothing but talk for over an hour, and the plot is so slowly paced that it feels pretty boring, with the overall presentation being the only thing that keeps this film going. To be completely honest, I haven't really seen a lot of heist movies, so I don't know how a heist movie is suppose to play out, but it's still pretty boring to me. The characters are alright, but they aren't always interesting. Really, the characters benefit from the occasionally humorous script. It's watchable, and it has some good moments, but it's not as good as it looks. At the very least it isn't any longer than two hours.",

And the cast varies between Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Carl Reiner, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia and more, and they're just such a unique group.\nOceans Eleven is a cleverly thought out heist film with clever ideas behind it and great acting and scriptwriting at it's roots. It's very cleverly made, ell paced and just a good romp.\n\nThe slight negatives would be that I feel like more creativity could have gone into the actual heist and that it went down too quickly.\nThe story also seemed to have more focus on the character backgrounds than the heist, which could have been balanced out a bit better.

The whole film is about how they plan to do the heist, and they build up how impossible it is to do.  There is   a scene where Danny Ocean goes over the plan, which sounds almost impossible to do, and he says it like it's nothing.  Which is just an awesome scene.\r\n\r\nIt is kind of your typical guys casino, or heist film, but better.  The poker scenes are like the scenes in Matt Damon's other good film Rounder's.  The film has the same film feel that all gambling films, and casino movies have that make them so entertaining.  The guys in the movies always talk to each other in a certain way, which makes them sound really cool.  That is true with this film, they are all really cool.  George Clooney was the coolest for sure.  Brad Pitt brought the same cool guy performance he played in Fight Club to this film, and once again proved how underrated he is.\r\n\r\nDanny Ocean also has a personal vendetta with the heist he is trying to pull off.  His wife left him after he was sent to prison, and now she is with the man who runs the casino.  He is robbing his casino not only for money but also to defeat the man with his ex wife.  Andy Garcia played that man.  Andy Garcia was what Robert DeNiro as in Casino, in this film.  The guy who ran the big Casino in Las Vegas.  Ocean does win his wife back too.  It was a total in your face job by Danny Ocean.  \r\n\r\nThe robbery scene is awesome.  It is brilliant the way they pull it off.  It worked perfectly.  Everything went exactly to plan.  They even caused a citywide blackout, which was awesome.  They really thought it all out well.  In the two weeks leading up to their epic heist, they are checking everything out in the casino, and figuring out the ways to figure it all out.  They also have a lot of good dialogue, and funny lines.\r\n\r\nThe music in this film also adds to the entertainment.  It's the type of stuff you hear in films like Dirty Harry, Goodfellas, and James Bond.  The funky rock, blues, and jazz music should be in all films like this.  It makes the film way better.  Music, and movies are my two big pations, so I like it when they have good use of music in movies, which this film really did.  I loved this movie all around.",

Rather, he plans a heist to rob three of Vegas' biggest casinos and loot over 150 million dollars.  Of course, this job is too big to do alone.  Ocean get's 10 other recruits, for a total of eleven people, making this genius heist.\n\nOcean's Eleven would like to convince you that there's an emotional core to the film.  In fact, there is, in the form of Ocean's ex-wife Tess, whom he is trying to win back.  Alas, this romance is written with a minimal of elegance, and creates problems for the film's pacing.  Ocean's Eleven is at it's best when ignoring the romantic aspect of the film, and focuses on entertaining.\n\nDespite the fact that Ocean's Eleven is, in fact, a heist movie, the action is not what makes Ocean's Eleven such an entertaining film.  It's the characters, whom are funny, developed, and best of all; memorable.  Ocean's Eleven has a huge assembly of wonderfully entertaining characters who really make the movie.\n\nGeorge Clooney plays Danny Ocean who we sympathize with, and he gets much of the one-liners.  Brad Pitt portrays Rusty Ryan, who may strike one as less humorous than the rest of the cast.  Matt Damon plays a nervous wannabe named Linus Caldwell, and Julia Roberts acts as Tess- Ocean's ex.  The more humorous characters, Saul, Basher and Reuben (the arguable standout that should've been in more scenes) are played by Carl Reiner, Don Cheadle and Elliott Gould respectively.\n\nConstant attempts at \"quotable\" lines are made, and while most of them work, a decent amount fall flat.  Some are so bad you may wince.  Though it's unlikely you'll remember too many of the bad lines when there are so many memorable ones.  You're likely to have a couple favorites by the end of the film.\n\nSimilarly to Ocean's Eleven's attempt at romance, this film also tries to convince us that this is an intelligent film.  This is by no means a smart movie.  Nor is it a dumb one.  While it's general ignorance to things like common logic may irritate some, this is still far more intelligent than most popcorn flicks.\n\nThe score, by David Holmes is not poor, by any means.  It's just a little generic.  It has a basic jazz feel without doing anything truly unique.  The emphasis on electronic sounds was also irritating.  It works well for the movie overall, but it's extremely forgettable.  Also, the music played at the end is truly atrocious, mostly because it doesn't match the film at all.  A clunky piano piece and a sudden change to orchestra made the ending feel incredibly dramatic, like the conclusion to a masterpiece.  Ocean's Eleven is not a masterpiece, and the music is almost laughably out of place at the end.\n\nFlaws aside, Ocean's Eleven is marvelously entertaining and incredibly fun.  Not everything works, but it's such a fun ride you'll hardly care.  A true winner, if far from perfection.",

And its serious enough to still have some credibility.\n\nThe story is of Danny Ocean and his team. They plan on ripping off three casinos in one night. Oh, and the casinos vault is almost impossible to break into. Also adding to the story is Danny Oceans wife Tess. She is together with the owner of the casinos that are about to be ripped off, a man named Terry Benedict. Not only does Ocean want to steal Benedict's money, but also his girlfriend.\n\nGeorge Clooney headlines this absolutely star-studded movie. He is perfect as Danny Ocean, very suave. Brad Pitt stars as his right hand man, Rusty Ryan. Its Pitt looking cooler then everybody else, and being funny as well. A great character. Julia Roberts plays Tess Ocean well, but it seems like shes only there to hang out with the rest of this great cast. Matt Damon also stars as Linus Caldwell, a slightly innocent pickpocket. Matt Damon is one of my favorite actors, and he plays a good Linus. The rest of the cast consists of Andy Garcia, Don Cheadle, Carl Reiner, Elliott Gould, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, and Bernie Mac. Needless to say, this cast is out-of-their-mind good!\n\nOverall, this movie is fun, and smart. Its a really good way to spend 2 hours. \n\n\n\"Blackjack?! Might as well call it whitejack.\" 7.5/10",
