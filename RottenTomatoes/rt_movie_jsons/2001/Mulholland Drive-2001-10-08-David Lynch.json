I haven't watched a Lynch film since the \u2018Blue Velvet' days, so I thought I knew what was coming, but\u2026.. actually I was lulled into a state of complacency. The beginning was slow and I was not cued into all the subtle flag posts. I remember thinking the colours and cinematography is now a bit dated & then wallop! I'm not even sure what happened. I was dragged into a cesspool of the mind & psyche and I was looking in all the wrong places! Lol! I'll need to re-watch sooner than later.",

The plot is borderline nonsensical until you understand what's going on but it's at least clear from subtext that everything isn't what it appears to be. The movie uses some super unnerving POV shots coupled with an ominous soundscape that become very fitting in hindsight. The movie isn't dramatic in a traditional sense, but it nevertheless has a satisfying conclusion if you can piece it together. Simply understanding the plot is quite the mental exercise and there is so much symbolism at play that there's likely a lot I've missed. I wouldn't say I enjoyed Mulholland Drive, but I understand why it's praised as a great cinematic accomplishment.",

The famed Mulholland Drive jump scare has become one of the most famous in film history; renowned as the scariest scene of all time; and now has a life of its own thanks to the internet.  It also borrows a bit from the Twilight Zone's perchance to dream; which investigates the idea of a man being stalked by a figure in his dreams; which eventually gets the best of him.",

The sense part (with bits of nonsense sprinkled throughout) is so good because it makes the audience really want to know where the story will go and the answer to the mystery. The last bit of sense left the film after Betty and Rita had sex. We are transported to a depressing and less interesting alternate reality. I can't help but think this is another Evangelion situation, where Lynch the creator, although already known for his surrealist style, try to make a coherent story for a TV pilot, but doesn't know how to end it. So he made the rest surreal and weird.",

I had to look up what was happening the whole entire movie and was disappointed. I also think there was stuff in the movie that really didn't add to the film whatsoever and should have been left out of the movie completely. For example, the sex scenes. However, the reasoning behind still giving it a 3/5 star review is due to the fact that it had me hooked from the very start and all the jumping made me want to know what the hell was even happening. I also found the cinematography very amusing and entertaining. I think that the casting was quite exquisite for this film. Naomi Watts did one of the best acting jobs I have seen in very long time in my opinion.",

Our lead character (Naomi Watts) arrives, she sits, she talks, she observes, and it concludes with her shedding angry tears. Those actions themselves are not bizarre, so they could never take place in Lynch's surreal Eraserhead. But in MH, this scene is a powerful crescendo, made more so by 'bits of craziness' like an out-of-focus lens, a spanish-spoken sentence, puzzling attendees to the party and strange music - not to mention the identity switching the movie is known for. Yet this scene isn't even one of the more (in)famous scenes of the film. Turn the lights down, the volume up, put down your phone and take a ride on Mulholland Drive.",

Like most of Lynch's films, you get the feeling that the joke is ultimately on the audience with Lynch sitting back and chuckling over the myriad of speculations regarding themes and plot.  It is a movie filled with odd camera angles, a typically eerie music score, mysterious characters, an indecipherable plot, and what seem to be deliberately stilted dialogue and performances.  And it is riveting from beginning to end, casting a spell that remains unbroken until you walk away and try to shake the cobwebs of confusion from your head.",

Despite the corruption, it is all about Diane in her psyche and this is where the destructive powers are thrust into the world violently.  The dark, shadow figure, the Devil, silencio, is everything merged and collapsed into a metaphysical black hole (the black box).  The only ending that could happen in Diane's case.  She understands, deep within her ID, the corrupt superficiality of it all, she desires it for herself, she cannot have it and is not capable, she engages in vicious self-mockery that ultimately leads to violent self- destruction.

            "content": "I found Mulholldand Drive to be a fantastic film, having loved all of David Lynch's films seen personally so far (personal favourite being The Elephant Man, one of the most emotionally affecting films ever made) with the exception of Dune. For this viewer, Mulholland Drive is one of Lynch's best films and among the best films of the 2000s, but it is also one of Lynch's most love-it-or-hate-it films- from a love/hate him director- as seen in the reviews here. And it is very understandable why people would dislike it, it is weird (not unusual for Lynch), it is slow, the story mayn't be clear to some, the symbolism may go over people's heads and it does get confusing especially towards the end. And it has nothing to do with not getting it, it is just not for everybody's tastes and not everybody is going to connect with it. For those who love it neither of these are problems, admittedly it is a good idea to be acquainted with Lynch's style beforehand so that it doesn't come across as too much of a shock and also to watch it more than once. Justifying what was so great about Mulholland Drive, a good place to start would be the visuals, which are never less than scintillating with bold colours, symbolic imagery and some of the most striking cinematography of any film from this decade. The Silencio Club scene is so beautifully shot. The haunting retro score, thought-provoking dialogue and that it contains some of Lynch's finest direction and the best directing of all the films from 2001 are further things to like. The story is where those who dislike it are perplexed, granted there may be too many plot strands crammed in towards the end and not everybody's going to like how the ending is open to interpretation, but with me the thriller-drama story was gripping and I was captivated so much by the surrealist atmosphere, offbeat emotional intensity and sizzling suspense that the slow pacing didn't feel slow at all. It wisely focused on the relationship between Watts and Harring, and while bizarre it was very well handled. The cast carry the film brilliantly, especially with the sensational lead performance of Naomi Watts who has never been better than here. Laura Harring is enchanting and Justin Theroux is very good. In conclusion, while not for everybody's tastes for understandable (and quite obvious) reasons Mulholland Drive was fantastic in all areas. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

It takes place in the crazy mind of David Lynch. It's one frenetic, chaotic, silent, suspenseful, vibrant and sexual movie, and that's what makes it so unique.\n\nThe story is very complex and filled with small details that help you complete the riddle. This is one of those few movies that by the end I was extremely confused with what had just happened, but was still able to call it a masterpiece. This felt like a fever dream in the most incredible way. It's also cool how I never knew which path the film would follow and that would just make me always want to know what would happen next.\n\nThe acting was also pretty dang good. Naomie Watts was definitely the star of the film, but Laura Harring did a pretty good job too. Somehow i really felt like this movie couldn't be done with other cast, which sounds funny knowing what happens in the film.\n\nThe way this movie was shot was very unique and surrealistic and created a dream-like atmosphere. The score was also jaw dropping and was able to play with our feelings like it was nothing.\n\nLynch is an incredible director and I'm looking forward to watch more of his work. It's probably the first director that in the same scene was able to make me drop a tear and go completely bonkers in the next second.",

Noami Watts's acting and dialogue is stiff and awkward - in fact, her scene-within-a-scene acting at her audition is better than anything seen in the rest of the film. It's certainly a memorable film, but I'm a believer that films should be enhanced by later analysis, not completely incomprehensible without it.

The plot makes no sense and about 2/3rd's of the way through, Lynch just changes the story (starting with the lockbox) making the previous hour and a half or so a complete waste of time, as if it wasn't already.  If you are a fan of this film, please do not recommend it to anyone else (such as a friend), as they will probably not be your friend anymore for wasting 2-3 hours of their life.

Lynch would have to be an omniscient, intensely skilled director with uncompromising vision for the ending to feel like anything but an intentionally-confusing cop-out. He'd done a good job setting up an interesting TV pilot, albeit one with languid pacing, but to me there is no question he tried to make a strong, coherent ending & failed to do so, going with this jumbled mess instead. The most obvious interpretation (dream) is surely the one Lynch was going for; nobody is sure because he feels being mercurial about it allows for his unresolved plot points to be given a pass. I did find myself riveted by the movie (despite the slow pacing, particularly in the middle when they're trying to figure out who Diane is), but mostly because I could not for the life of me figure out what'd given the movie so much esteem. The crash scene was well-done but from the moment they introduced Naomi's character by way of some bizarrely poorly-performed dialogue with the old folks (both the couple from the plane & the landlord spoke like they were waiting for their turn to speak instead of having a conversation) I was attentive only to ensure I didn't miss what everyone had loved here. An optimist might say that the unnatural way they talked was because it's a dream, but I think not -- they weren't so uncanny as to be intentional, and the Cowboy actor was equally bad. One might also look at the symbolism & camera angles & music and see excellence, and perhaps there is some there, but this movie ranking among the greatest of all time reveals that the film critic community has an outsized proportion of masochists who like it when directors make them look stupid.

Unless you can convince an array of critics and audiences that your film doesn't reek of pretentiousness despite not adhering to conventional tenets of narrative progression and character, you risk being condemned as insufferably caught up in an exaggerated sense of self-importance. In Mulholland Dr., Lynch once again shows that he is more than capable of clearing that gap with the right material. While interpretations of the film are many and unconfirmed, I take its many interconnecting dreamlike sequences and uncertainty of identity to be a unified portrait of Hollywood itself, where preconceptions, ambitions, and practical experiences (both of disillusionment and success) collide in a confusing network of events, each vying for prominence in the mind's eye. Even the genre clash supports an interpretation of this type, alternating between conventional Golden Age noir, modern thriller, surrealist art piece, and intense romance; none is necessarily to be considered the 'correct' genre of the film, but each contribute heavily to the final product. No character exists in a vacuum (despite many seemingly unrelated events), and can tie into each other in completely unexpected ways. Even if its interpretations may not be fixed (which may anger some audience members), there is a relentless dedication to unpredictability that is sorely missing from much mainstream film in the present, and makes a first-time viewing a wonderful experience. Solid performances all around, and even a bizarre little cameo from Billy Ray Cyrus. Lynch sure does love putting female crooners in the midcentury style on center stage, having done so in some of his most prominent films (Eraserhead, Blue Velvet, and Mulholland Dr.). (4.5/5)",

You can watch some films without paying any real attention to the story because come the final 5 minutes you'll get all the answers you need - The End!\n\nBut with Lynch, he likes to play with you, like a kitten playing with a ball of wool.

            "content": "This is my 4th David Lynch film, and so far I'd say it's his most interesting, narratively speaking.  I'd heard about how enigmatic, surreal, strange, and inexplainable 'Mulholland Drive' was for years.  Heading into it, I prepared myself to be either satisfied with the critical acclaim behind it, or vehemently disappointed and confused about it's non-linear narrative.  I'll say this: I really liked it, but not in the sense that I was conventionally entertained.  No, I really liked this because, not to be cliched, 'Mulholland Drive' is an experience through and through.  Movies like this encapsulate the concept of how some films aren't cut and dry stories, but rather experiences that you just have to allow yourself to be immersed in.  Let the experience take you places, ask questions, try to piece the puzzle together, and no matter how hard you try, in the end, you remain confused yet utterly hypnotized.  'Mulholland Drive' plays like a long, elaborate dream/nightmare.  Lynch composes his camera movements and shots to further emphasize the dream-like atmosphere and vibe the movie carries.  The facial expressions, pacing, ominous score, dialogue, lighting, and more are all combined to feel like you're vicariously watching a dream.  There's no way this movie's story (if you can call it that) has any grounds in reality.  Who was conspiring against Rita?  Was Betty set up?  Wait, Betty was Diane?  Rita's real name is Camilla?  Total mind-job.  The films final act pulls the rug from underneath its viewers at every turn.  If you think you've remotely figured out what everything meant by the last act, the last act pulls out more illusionary and surrealist tricks to eventually leave you with your hands in the air and your shoulder's shrugged.  Only a movie directed by a man as intelligent as Lynch can have this psychological effect on you.  'Mulholland Drive' is an abstract piece of art that teases you with potential answers to its puzzle, then yanks them away from you, forcing you to continue trying to make sense of everything.  I'll be re-watching this no doubt.\n\n*After watching an in-depth analysis, I decided to bump this up to a 4.5.  If it holds up on a future rewatch, or is subjectively better (after everything makes more sense thanks to said analysis), it could very well be a 5.*",

There are certainly lot of echoes of his success \"Twin Peaks,\" but it's also easy to see why ABC wasn't interested.\n\nLynch has compared his concept to the often mysterious, inexplicable quality of life. If you prefer simple, linear story lines, a David Lynch movie is not going to be for you. And this one is quite out there. This was my second time seeing it and it still doesn't make any sense. For me it ends up baffling, frustrating, and plainly ludicrous.\n\nIf you want to watch it, and good luck to you if you do, it is available on The Criterion Channel, if you subscribe to that service.\n\nFrank! It sounds like you hated it, why are you giving it 2 \u00bd stars? The first half shows real promise and certainly has style. It is also successful in its critical depiction of the oftentimes harmful desire for the fame and success of a Hollywood career\u2026 and all the characters encountered \u2013 then it goes careening out of control (much like \"Twin Peaks\" did.).",

Transforming from a dark, mysterious TV pilot into a fantasia of illusion and identity as a feature film, this unsettling, psychosexual dreamscape forces viewers into the role of movie detectives, frustrating the spectator within us to search for a rational interpretation, and mystifies on a first, third or even fifth watch as 'a love story in the city of dreams', exploring themes of obsession, cinephilia and queer identity. Brilliantly spotlighted throughout are our two female leads in split roles, with a commanding and star-making turn from Naomi Watts as ing\u00e9nue Betty, and Laura Elena Harring delivers a pitch-perfect performance as the helpless femme fatale Rita, making a mighty twosome that shine in intimate, erotic and most of all human scenes, no matter how strange their mysterious circumstances may appear to be. Bearing the hallmarks of classic Lynchian horror, like macabre imagery, tragic narrative beats and an intense, oestensible quality that disorients and disturbs, the Tinseltown neo-noir is considered one of the best films of the 21st century, inspiring thought-provoking conversation and almost-surgical dissection of its intoxicating sequences, thanks to its famed director's sensory style of filmmaking and visionary storytelling. Frequent Lynch collaborator and cinematographer Peter Deming is in top form capturing the uncanny in every frame, as every shot is carefully composed to drip with foreboding atmopshere and an avant-garde aesthetic, but Angelo Badalamenti's haunting and ominous score is the most memorable work in this masterpiece, acting as an emotional tour guide for delirious audiences while weaving genuine mystery into an already unsettling tale. As someone most eloquently put it, 'a beautiful experience'.\n\n10/10 blue boxes.",

The whole film feels like a dream, it's amazing how it manages to blur the lines between illusions and reality. It features amazing writing, and a very strong and great performance by Naomi Watts. Mulholland Drive is also full of symbolism, and the music is good too. It's a movie that tackles themes of illusions, guilt and desperation. But it's an art house movie for sure, it will only appeal to a certain audience, because the story takes a long time to develop, and only gets engaging enough after a good one hour. Overall, this is quite a surreal neo-noir experience, and for those who are fans of art house pics, this one has got to be seen!",

It's the rare movie that made me question why I enjoy off putting and oddly structured films like Only God Forgives, 2001: A Space Odyssey and any Yorgos Lanthimos film, but can't enjoy this film. And while I don't think it's necessarily one specific reason, I do think part of it is just it's lack of coherence, not in narrative, but in pacing, tone and structure. It doesn't feel like one movie is being told from beginning to end. It feels like the assassin who comically has to kill 3 people because of unfortunate screw ups and the man who sees a scary figure outside of a diner don't belong in the same film because of how it's presented and when it's placed. I know that for the ultimate \"meaning\" of the movie, it was probably deliberate and that's absolutely fine.

            "content": "#9 Naomi Watts & Laura Harring.\n\nMulholland Drive is the gift that keeps on giving. Like most of David Lynch's non-linear storylines, there is something new to be seen or deduced with each viewing. Long before Black Mirrors \u2018Bandersnatch' got everyone's panties in a twist, Lynch had been inviting us all to choose our own endings by travelling through his unconscious as it unfolds on screen, and allowing us to dissect each alternate theory, no concept needing to be correct.\n\nMulholland Drive is no exception. Upon the first viewing I was left with the usual \u2018what the fuck just happened' feeling. Granted, that reaction was much less obvious in comparison to the first time I saw \u2018Lost Highway', some films are not meant to be explained. Both have people switching from one personality to the next and both focus on dreams.\n\nThe sexual element in Mulholland Drive may not seem that strong for a Sex Gourmet article. The sex scenes are not explicit nor lengthy and they merely allude to a full sexual encounter, however the mood that is created throughout the few close moments we see, and the talent of both Watts and Harring in these intimate scenarios, are worthy of discussion.\n\nBetty (Watts) is a fledgling actor who has just arrived in LA to housesit for her Aunt who is working on a film abroad. Rita (Harring) has been in car crash and is suffering from amnesia. She does not know her own name. Rita, lost and confused, manages to sneak into Bettys aunt's home while the apartment is unoccupied. When Betty arrives, they have an awkward meeting in the bathroom, but soon become friends as they journey through a Nancy Drew like adventure to discover Rita's identity.\n\nBetty is Rita's nurturing and empathic guardian throughout each twist and turn of the investigation.  With her Disney-like confidence, straight back and high blond curls, Betty is the optimistic soul in contrast to Rita's fearful, dark and mysterious nature. Rita carries physical secrets from her past. A large amount of cash, and a strange blue key. Upon finding a dead body after following a lead, they both are traumatised, and this penultimate step in their investigation leads to their first sexual experience together.\n\nThe scene is set in Bettys bedroom. Betty is in bed with freshly scrubbed face, pink pyjamas and gold hair shining nearly silver in the night-time light. She invites Rita to join her in bed to get a break from the couch Rita has been sleeping on. Rita removes her towel and she is beautifully naked as she climbs next to Betty in the large double bed. There is a look of slight awkwardness on Bettys face as she sees Rita in just her skin, but we see an appraising glance also mixed in with the shyness.\n\nAs they lie together, Rita looks up at Betty, her face open and earnest, and expresses her gratitude. There is a tangible feeling of love, kindness and trust as Rita leans over, whispers \u2018goodnight sweet Betty' and kisses her on her brow. Betty turns her face up to Rita as she says goodnight and they join lips in the most tentative way. Both looking at each other in a different way than they had before.\n\nFrom here, their coupling becomes more erotic than friendly, as they begin to caress and kiss each other with ardour. Betty's clothing now removed, they are pressed against each other, Betty softly touching Rita's full round breasts. The sound here is very emotive. With echoes of aroused hushed breath in the dark, their kisses become more intense and artful and it is very erotic. The camera is focused only on the upper part of their naked bodies, and as they continue and there is a real poignancy here. \n\nUpon first viewing, it may seem like a first-time encounter between two women, not necessarily remarkable apart from the fact that they look sublime together. As the film unfolds after this scene and upon watching for the second time, we realise the weight of this love scene. The shocking black of Rita's hair against Bettys gold as they kiss each other looks beautiful and the attraction looks authentic. Angelo Badalamenti's dark score adds significantly to the sadness that pervades this encounter.\n\nSoon after this scene, both journey on one final escapade together in the hunt for Rita's identity. The film now takes its Lynchian turn. After an off kilter visit to a nightclub called \u2018Silencio' (one the more remarkable scenes in the film) they both return home, Rita inexplicably finds a strange blue box which fits the blue key she had in her purse. Betty has now disappeared completely from the apartment despite Rita calling out for her. As Rita opens the blue box with the key, she seems to be sucked into it, and the scene fades to black.\n\nThe next scene opens with someone we think is Betty. She is in a shabby, cold apartment and dressed in a worn grey dressing gown. Despite having a striking resemblance to Betty, this woman is Diane (Watts). She has none of Bettys shine or confidence. He shoulders are slumped and her hair, dirty blonde and lank. She reminisces for a moment, and there is a flashback with her and love interest Camilla (Harring) who is Rita's doppelganger. Diane straddles Camilla on her couch in this memory, and a far cry from the modest and kind Rita, Camilla is lusty, half naked, heavily made up and cruel.\n\nShe plays with the mentally unbalanced Diane like a cat with a bird. So much so, it incites Diane and she begins to roughly molest Camilla as they lie on the couch together. There is so much angst and pain in this scene and we realise we may be looking at the real relationship of the fictional Betty and Rita. Diane is now the vulnerable and lost soul, while Camilla holds the cards and turns the handle on Diane's back, humiliating her in various moments only to show kindness shortly after, and pull Diane back into her cruel game.\n\nThe film is split in nearly two parts, the mystery of Rita's identity and a few other storylines that seem to go nowhere are nearly 80/90 minutes of this dreamy, confusing tale. The latter part shows the reality of LA, the cruelty of love and the destruction of both Diane/Betty and Camilla/Rita. There are multiple theories to be explored here. What is the purpose of the first tale and who is dreaming of who? Is it even a dream?\n\nShortly after we witness Diane and Camilla's near sexual romp on the couch, we see Diane alone in her apartment. Crying, desperately alone and furiously masturbating as the camera shows the wall in front of her in and out of focus. Possibly implying that the first 90 minutes of the film are nothing more than a masturbatory fantasy of Diane's as she imagines a superior life in Hollywood, better than her confused and horrific encounter of love with the unobtainable Camilla.\n\nMulholland Drive is a stark reminder on the significance of duality in a human lifetime. This concept is sometimes hard and painful to grasp. There is no existence without the clashing of opposites. We all strive for Utopia, peace, love and balance, when it evades us, we question why. There is no such thing as big without small, love without hate, peace without war.\n\nFrom the black and white zig zag floors in Twin Peaks' Black Lodge, to the simplicity of contrast in hair colour, Lynch makes sure we know that pain and pleasure exist alongside each other, each opposite giving the other meaning. This is the human experience. We understand the greatest love and greatest agony, both beautiful in their reality side by side. Sex is the push and the acceptance. Actuality requires us to respect both sides of the coin.\n\nWe can apply these thoughts to Mulholland Drive. This is a beautiful, despairing tale of kindness, vicious love and sexual dominion, set perfectly in the mind-control mecca that is Hollywood \u2013 where dreams are manufactured.\n\n8/10 \u2013 For mirroring the sexy dreams we wake from, at the very best moment.\n\nhttps://vinylwriters.com/the-sex-gourmet-mulholland-drive-2001/",

The film is structured as a mystery set in Hollywood, although, in typical Lynchian fashion, this version of Tineseltown is decidedly dark and skewed. The plot weaves together several strands: a young, fresh-looking Canadian girl who has come to La-la land in search of stardom; an established actress who avoids being murdered by an act of dumb luck and loses her memory as a result; and a director who is being forced by ominous powers to cast a particular woman in his movie. It's all intriguing stuff. The film is drenched in atmosphere. That shouldn't be a surprise. Credit the cinematography of Peter Deming and the score by Angelo Badalamenti. Mulholland Drive is filled with its share of \"Twin Peaks\"-ish moments. If you like David Lynch films chances are you'll enjoy this film although it will take a seating too many. ",

The film does start out with a number of disconnected scenes, and a lot of confusing elements, but I was surprised after watching for a little while that some of it actually played like a real story. I mean the acting was almost universally terrible, but at least a couple scenes threatened to make sense. David Lynch is never content with that kind of storytelling, though, so he\u2019ll just randomly throw in a little person in a giant room, shown from 30 feet away for no discernible reason, or we\u2019ll take a trip to a farcically dressed cowboy who speaks in ominous gibberish. It\u2019s infuriating because things are shot well, and he is able to hire good actors, so I feel like he could make an amazing real movie if someone reined him in, but this is Lynch set loose. The final nail in the Mulholland Dr. coffin gets hammered in when there are only 45 minutes left and everything changes. Any slight shred of logic is thrown out the window, and it becomes a completely different movie. The two are linked through some images and characters, but otherwise Lynch gives the audience a big middle finger for trying to make sense of the prior hours of lunacy. Now we\u2019ve got some new stupidity to deal with, and at this point I stopped caring and was begging for it to end. There is nothing I hate worse than doing homework to make sense of a film that was written so poorly that it couldn\u2019t clearly articulate its own plot to the audience, but I made an exception this time simply because someone recommended it. Each article I read online was more and more infuriating. The general consensus seemed to be that the first 2 hours of the film were all a dream. That\u2019s the kind of stupid nonsense that schlock movies do for a \u201cshocking twist\u201d at the end, yet we\u2019re supposed to see it as genius this time because it\u2019s made by David Lynch? No, I\u2019m not buying into the hype. He\u2019s a crazy person who likes to make crap up as he goes, and people assign it all deeper meaning themselves, because they want to believe he is an amazing auteur.",

            "content": "This is an utterly confounding experience that has more to say than most films made in the 21st century. The only David Lynch film I had seen previous to this was Dune (1984) which is a mess with some interesting parts. Fortunately this is considered one of his greatest masterpieces and I can understand why he is considered one of the most innovative directors of the latter half of the 20th century and the 21st century. I was aware that the film was going to contain surrealism and seemingly unrelated plotlines but I was not prepared for how funny, disturbing and just strange this film would turn out to be. It was an experience that I'm not sure I am ready to go through again for quite some time but I'm glad that I have seen something as original as this.\n\nBetty Elms, Naomi Watts, is a Canadian inspiring actress who has recently moved to Los Angeles only to discover that Rita, Laura Elena Harring, is inhabiting her aunt's apartment and owns a strangely shaped blue key. The two set off on a journey that leads to a narcissistic director Adam Kasher, Justin Theroux, disturbing dreams about mobsters and a club where a crazy woman sings \"Silencio.\" The third act plot twist comes seemingly out of nowhere and we are left wondering if what we had previously seen was all Betty's dream or if they are in an alternate timeline or any of a million other convoluted explanations to how these characters connect.\n\nThe way that I chose to interpret the film was that the first half was all Betty's fantasy as she takes on the more desirable features of Rita/Camilla and Rita comes to rely on her while in the real world their dynamic is swapped. The dinner table scene toward the end in which Betty's anger toward Camilla and Adam hints at her lesbian desire for her and we understand that her imagining Adam being attracted to her is more about her love and jealousy of Camilla than her attraction to Adam. The love scenes between the two woman also felt as though they weren't just exploiting the actresses to appeal to a male audience but trying to show the genuine affection between them.\n\nThe \u00e2~bungled heist' was also a funny and well choreographed scene that felt as though it was something out of a Shane Black movie. The execution of scenes that would feel as though they were extraneous to the plot if not for the third act twist were key to the film working. The scene set at the diner in which a man dies incorporates horror but as with the other seemingly unrelated moments keeps you on edge in your continual search for answers. Answers are never given but that would make watching and discussing the film far less interesting and the mystery is part of the point.\n\nI am a complete plebiscite and you can read several really detailed analyses online of the various elements of the film but one of the things I really enjoyed about the film were the performances. I understand that most David Lynch films feature deliberate over acting but that works within the stories that Lynch chooses to tell. This is clear in the performances of Watts and Harring as Watts plays both an innocent ing\u00c3 (C)nue and a washed up, jealous actress and Harring plays the dark, mysterious femme fatale who is easily manipulated. The very creepy audition scene which Watts acts in shows her working on two levels as we have seen her be a bad actress up until this point and yet during the audition she does a fantastic job and blows everyone away. Having a moment of Watts giving what would be considered modern acting in the middle of her outsized performance shows how delusional her character is.\n\nThis is one of the best films of 2000s and is one of the best surreal films I have seen during my lifetime, I have never watched a Luis Bu\u00c3\u00b1uel directed film. Even a dilettante like myself could engage with this film on some level and yet it is still working on deeper levels than anybody but David Lynch can comprehend.",

            "content": "A dreamscape of Hollywood from David Lynch.\n\nMulholland Drive (2001) is a not logically sound, nor is it conclusive in its character arcs as several characters and story lines disappear after awhile. You have to go into Mulholland Drive knowing that everything is simply an illusion in some form or another. The narrative makes standard sense for the first 2 hours, then the last half hour makes no sense upon a first viewing. I had to think about the finale and I realized what I had just watched was the reality and the first 2 hours were the dream all along. Mulholland Drive is a sad dream of a failed actress and scorned lover. It's like David Lynch venting out his frustrations for the types of people in L.A. He satirizes the filmmaking process and the direction's choices, while playing with structure so much that you are inevitably confused.\n\nMulholland Drive is certainly a slow burn, but one that flames into insanity with a satisfying flourish. I cannot stop thinking about this film as I appreciate its risks and madness all the more over time. To be honest, Mulholland Drive is not a perfect film as the slow pace can feel unbearable at times, characters are quirky for the sake of appearing dreamy and obscure, and a few effects do not really look realistic. However, the strong innovative direction from Lynch and the deep emotional and well thought out script leave the audience stunned at Mulholland Drive. How can you not be left shook from the powerful ending? Mulholland Drive asks you to undertake a journey in which your attitude must change and you must stop expecting the film to play out how you want it to, but rather attempt to understand what the film is showing you. The sheer amount of detail placed in every scene, especially as Lynch does leave you clues everywhere, while covering them up in plain sight with bizarre visuals and unexpected twists. The constantly shifting perspective keeps you engaged, while secretly undermining your sense of who characters are and which are actually important. Mulholland Drive is like a feast of red herrings.\n\nBesides David Lynch's endlessly creative direction alongside his own gripping narrative, erratic and clever structure, and tear inducing emotional arc, the score in Mulholland Drive is quite beautiful. Lynch knows how and when to invoke lovely songs to lavish you in sound.\n\nLastly, the performances are key in Mulholland Drive. Naomi Watts gives her career best performance as an actress in Mulholland Drive. Her endearing charming Betty is also captivating in her audition sequence. Watts plays up the sweetness simultaneously with the madness of Diane. Likewise, Laura Harring gives Rita and Camilla a charming sultry appeal. Her focused anguish and sudden fear meld with stunning beauty and charming personality. She is the perfect foil for Naomi Watts laying on waves of soothing kindness and impressive expressiveness. I have to hand it to Justin Theroux as Adam. He embodies Lynch's frustrations with directing films in Hollywood.\n\nOverall, I have to say that Mulholland Drive is incredibly frustrating initially. It was not for several hours until I realized the massive scope and vivid detail that went into Mulholland Drive. Lynch is clearly a mad genius with more ambition than nearly any other American director. I applaud his creative vision and technical skill at accomplishing a film of such profound emotion and straightforward narrative delivered in a mad structure.",

He throws everything into the mix with the lone goal of confusing us. Nothing makes any sense because it's not supposed to make any sense. There's no purpose or logic to events. Lynch is playing a big practical joke on us. He takes characters we have come to care about and obscures their fates in gibberish. Some people will undoubtedly decide this is all very deep and will find hidden meanings in everything, but they're giving Lynch too much credit. This is not good filmmaking; it's immature and wasteful.(Amazing first two thirds, then cop out).",

The result was a forced grown-up version of The Wizard of Oz.  The film had many gripping moments with beautiful subtleties from the performers but I walked away with an even further cemented conviction that Hollywood is a cesspool in a land of broken dreams.  Mr. Lynch should go and study Mr. Hitchcock's films if he wants to learn how to develop the art of true mystery.  It seems however, he would rather hit viewers over the head with a sledgehammer.  On another note, did anyone get reminded of Tales of the City?  Now that was a lovely piece of work.  Save yourself the agony and skip Mullholland Drive.,",

The story is challenging and requires interpretation, and viewers have to be looking for that type of experience to enjoy it.  The characters are interesting, and the performances are outstanding.  One of the more coherent Lynch films, in my opinion, this movie still has a lot of unexplained symbolism and scenes that can be pointlessly debated (yay) and really just bloat the running time.  Although overall I am positive, it bugs me that the reality shift comes at a point that seems unconnected to the events occurring at that moment - it just happens, like an egg timer went off.

If you're expecting your typical coherent, easy-to-follow plot where everything is laid out or tied up at the end, this isn't that kind of movie. Let's put it this way: Mulholland Drive came out in 2001, and it's still being discussed as to what exactly happened. And Lynch being Lynch, he still won't spell it out for you. That seems to be his thing these days. He enjoys making surrealist films with the intention of each viewer having their own personal experience and drawing their own conclusions. In my opinion, Mulholland Drive is the closest thing to having an almost coherent storyline since Wild at Heart in 1990. It's his most intriguing work, I believe, and leaves the viewer feeling engaged with just a hint - a feeling that the mystery of what you just watched is solvable. It's easier to digest than Lost Highway or Inland Empire. It's a great, beautiful, tragic journey. Naomi Watts' performance is one of the greatest I've ever seen. She should have won an Oscar for Mulholland Drive. ",

The nightmare of blue velvet opened up as it neared the hollow of an auricle, and from this came out, once the nightmare had ended; Mulhland drive does not reflect this pseudo linearity, the images are swallowed by the darkness of a box in a zoomed in, and from this they immediately come back to light, but without the glance backtracking, it is the darkness itself that moves away. The black screen is not the filter between two universes, it is not the boundary line between dream and nightmare, but it is the plane on which they join.\nSince \"everything is recorded is all a tape\", to a music and a voice you can associate a different face, a song can be reproposed (as Dean Stockwell does in blue velvet singing Candy colored clown) by someone who in fact has never performed, and so a character who has been played by an actress, becomes in another guise. Three are the female figures who exchange the parts: Rita becomes Camilla, Camilla becomes Betty, and Betty becomes Diane. The latter is not a new name in the Lynch universe, as it was the one Kyle MacLachlan addressed in Twin Peaks when he spoke with his tape recorder. The Diane of Detective Cooper is therefore also only a tape, \"it's all recorded\", and it's never present as there is no band. Three actresses / characters compete for the part of the film's protagonist in the film, and three actresses (Watts, Harring, George) and three characters, compete for the main actress in Mulholland drive. All the other cast members remain in their role, as the cowboy says \"the rest of the cast can also remain, it depends on you, but the main actress does not, that does not depend on you\", she can not remain.\nRita Hayworth said: \"the men go to bed with Gilda, but they wake up with Rita\" and for Diane \"it's time to wake up\".",

Of course the director was clever to save a failed pilot and make it into a movie, but it is nowhere near the masterpiece that people are suggesting.  The few main characters that the director takes and spins into the tacked on ending switch is part of a clever plot but you can see this was not planned based on how many of the early elements have nothing to do with this last minute switch.  If this was acknowledged I would have more respect, but the bait and switch of it all and how people lap it up make it really annoying to see that it was a quick rework of a failed pilot and nowhere near so fantastic master class of story telling.",

The most memorably striking quality that stood out is the music that emphasizes the aura of the scene. \"Mulholland Drive\" can be disturbing in some places, but it's surely worth seeing, and as a probable supplemental preparation to Lynch's other similarly-structured film \"Inland Empire\".

A certain lack of effort seems to have become the norm here in the US and it really bugs me because people like David Lynch who in my mind are without a doubt, brilliant, are not taken as seriously as they should be because his movies require a bit of thinking to appreciate. Yes, this is a difficult movie to enjoy, but oh man, is it worth it when you do. I feel that I understand this movie enough (though obviously, I will never understand it completely, no matter how many nights I contemplate it before I go to sleep) after doing a lot of research  (Salon.com's explanation of this movie is really the best) to understand it to the extent that it is meant to and it is oh so rewarding because even if it is meant to be interpreted for the most part by its audience, its actual plot is intriguing, gripping, and really pretty brilliant. It isn't often that you find a movie with two plots that work this successfully with one another, especially when you're sort of making one of them up. With the knowledge I got from my research I can say that beyond the story, this movie is a pretty scathing statement on Hollywood and how the industry treats its workers (especially its directors and female actors.) while at the same time being sort of self-deprecating in a really funny way. This movie communicates so much so successfully, it's really pretty unbelievable. My only complaint is its gratuitous sequences of lesbian sex which I have heard defended a hundred times and I still have problems with. As a femme lesbian, I can say the sex in the movie is over the top and completely inaccurate. I cannot wrap my head around it being an artistic statement about sex scenes in other movies like people say it is or really anything other than for the enjoyment of the men making the movie. I understand that David Lynch has a reputation of putting actresses in situations like this, doing it almost to the point of humiliation, such as with Isabella Rosellini in Blue Velvet, which for this same reason, I somewhat agree with Ebert's reasoning for giving it such a bad review, even if I do love the rest of the movie outside that scene. That aside, however, Please, please watch this with an open mind and let yourself revel in the mindfuck for a while. It truly is a unique experience and deserves to be watched. I really cannot say enough about this movie. It is sort of infinite in a way. It's a real monster, but a monster you'll love for all of its complexities.",

            "content": "David Lynch shook the world at the start of the new millennium with Mulholland Drive, held by many to be among the greatest film since. The first of its kind in the genre, Lynch described it as a film about \"a love story in the city of dreams\", but to the first-time viewer it is just as capable of being described as \"the triumphs and tragedies of the most popular political family in American history\", or something equally arbitrary. Asides from being a splendid film purely in cinematographic terms, Mulholland Dr. was also a prominent political statement on two fronts: first, in its challenge against conventional cinema, and second in its novel approach to capitalism and the American Dream.\nMulholland Dr. tells its story in for the greater part in a \"main\" line, which is about a woman helping an amnesiac recover her memory. Running in parallel are a sequence of seemingly unrelated vignettes that do not tie into the, until the very end of the film. Many of these marginal notes remain unexplained even then, and their ambiguity is not a flaw, but rather a crucial element in the film's mystery element. The film as a whole does not proceed in an ordered plot, but rather in a combination of dreams and flashbacks. In doing so, Lynch overturned the definition of cinematic narrative, which had hitherto gone unchallenged. The idea that films must follow a temporal plot progression, or indeed that they must display narrative logic at all, was directly called into question with the film's release. What followed was a realization that audiences enjoyed having the opportunity to piece together a plot in absence of an absolute definition: something which occurs to an extent in all mystery films, but never on a scale as large as Mulholland Dr., and certainly not at the level of form.\nWhile the meaning that Lynch intended is known only to himself, a commonly accepted interpretation is that the first part of the film is a dream in which Diane Selwyn dissociates from herself after committing the murder. This is an example of Freud's theory on the unconscious being brought to life: it has all the elements of a dream-work. There is displacement, whereby Diane is incarnated as Betty Elms, the \"ideal\" Diane before her downfall; and Camilla is split into separate entities, Rita the part that Diane loved and the blonde Camilla the part she despised. There is condensation, whereby the perceived power behind all of Diane's misfortune is embodied as a mafia, complete with the cowboy as the strongman arm; and Diane's desire for recognition and fame is brought to life in the love scene she auditions for. The film is packed with metaphor, including the man behind the diner as the embodiment of Diane's failure, and Diane's corpse in the dream as a foreboding towards her suicide. Color and lighting are used to spectacular effect, creating an ominous suspense around the mafia, an unsettlingly bewildering atmosphere in Club Silencio, and maintaining suspense and darkness throughout the film. \nThrough Mulholland Dr., Lynch achieved a twofold purpose. Not only did he show that a film in which the primary tool of storytelling is metaphor rather than narrative can be successful, he also used the film as a protest against the American Dream (and by extension, capitalism). Mulholland Dr. is essentially what could be called a \"failure story\", a testimonial to how the idea of the American Dream benefits only a very few at the end, to the loss of the common man. By portraying Diane as a young hopeful actress, we see how a mere turn of chance results in her never receiving a big break, while Camilla becomes more and more successful. All the while, this affects their strained, forbidden relationship, until jealousy drives Diane mad and she kills both of them. Metaphorically, this is a representation of how competition at the expense of social relationships results in the mutual destruction of both parties.\nIn its protest against capitalism, Mulholland Dr. attempts to prove that its fundamental tenets are flawed. The idea that anyone can pull themselves up and succeed in the world is challenged in the dream, where it is revealed that the system is tightly governed and rigged by a small group of powerful people who are able to control the flow of wealth. They can blackmail and force Adam into hiring an actress against his imperative as a director. In doing this, Mulholland Dr. slams capitalism as a system which is not truly meritocratic, and provides only an illusion of free will as it guides a person's hand from the background. \nIn reality, the film provides a novel and alternative way to challenge capitalism, where before Marxist demystification was the only methodology for uncovering the flaws in a system. While both Marxism and the perspective the film provides have a common goal, their approaches are fundamentally different. Marxism argues that mystification is a result of a non-empirical, unscientific worldview, and therefore demystification counters that by laying bare the facts without any distortion - presenting the world as it is; whereas in Mulholland Dr., the methodology relies heavily on metaphor and distortion to unveil the flaws in a system. That reliance means that this new form of demystification certainly isn't Marxist in nature, but perhaps a more easily accessible and understandable one to society at large. Where Marxist demystification may appear very hardline and difficult to accept for the common man (and is also very difficult to accomplish in the first place), metaphoric demystification is a softer, artistic way of opening minds to challenge capitalism themselves.\nMulholland Dr. is an example of revolutionary cinema at its finest, bringing political change to the film industry and to society as a whole. It questions the status quo in cinematic narrative and in economics, all the while maintaining a dark, mysterious atmosphere which leaves the audience wondering so that the individual must find their own answers, and that has secured it a rank among the greatest films of all time.",

            "content": "Like all artists, filmmakers have a unique set of tools at their disposal; cameras, lenses, lights, microphones and music. They use these tools to tell their story or set a scene.  The director David Lynch has the same tools as everybody else but Lynch manipulates more than just these physical instruments; he uses the expectations of the viewer as a tool. He wields expectation, the expectation that comes from what we know about film, and our humanity with the same nuanced and power as someone else  might use light to create a variety of moods in a space. \nBetty has come to Hollywood, bright eyed and bushy tailed, to be a movie star. She is staying at her aunt's house where she discovers Rita, a woman who has been in a car accident and has lost all her memory. Betty does not seem to be a character with much internal depth or darkness. Her flatness of effect is even parodied in her very first scene in the airport where the dialogue is clearly overdubbed and fake. Her blind kindness makes her vulnerable to exploitation. For instance, she does not seem to care that a stranger is living in her aunt's house. \nIn the audition scene, Betty tries out for a part in a small movie called the Sylvia North Story. The scene occurs about halfway through the film. Our expectations for the audition have already been set up by much of what we have witnessed leading up to the scene. Coming up to the audition scene the audience members are somewhat invested in betty's success, a basic expectation for any protagonist, but they are wary of some danger that may be in store because of her innocence and we have little or no expectation that she will impress with her actin skills. At this point the audience has already seen the scene played out earlier in the house as a practice round with Betty and Rita. In the first reading, the scene is revealed to be trite and the dialogue clich\u00e9d and melodramatic. Betty's character rebukes her father's friend who is trying to seduce her for the second time it seems. She moves closer and closer as her threats become sterner. The Betty and Rita cannot finish the scene without laughing at the dramatic quality of the script. A universe of expectation has been laid out for the viewer and these expectations will work as a trap. Everything in the audition rooms seems to reinforce what we already think. The people are really stiff, Betty's reading partner is orange and looks like he has been getting too much sun, and the director is absent minded and laughable. When the scene begins, and Betty's reading partner pulls her in closer, what triggers first is our awareness of how vulnerable she is. When she pushes him away, the audience members do not know if she is reacting as herself or as the character. Then Woody moves to put his hands below Betty's waist and a transformation that is so sudden takes place. The transformation is so sudden that the viewer experiences whiplash. The audience members are lured into engaging emotionally with the scene when Lynch triggers our expectation that Betty might be exploited the viewers have dropped their guard and then they are left in awe because it is not like what they have expected based on the earlier seen where Betty and Rita were practicing. \nAnother instance, where Lynch utilized our expectations is in the beginning of the movie. Near the beginning of the film in Diane's apartment, it almost looks and sounds as if someone smoking cocaine. The film then pans across to Diane's red pillow, this is one of the many hints and references to dreams that the audience will receive during the film indicating that some of what the audience will be watching would be an illusion. Diane is experiencing a drug-induced stupor, where she dreams that for once, things go her way. She both gets the girl and the career she always wanted. When Diane wakes up, towards the end of the film, she is clearly depressed and then kills herself after her neighbor tells her that there are detectives looking for her. By showing these scene, lynch has provided the audience with knowledge of the main character prior to the movie so that the audiences expectations could be formulated. After he allows the audience to formulate expectations, he catches them off guard and surprises them with a plot twist. \nAll throughout the film from the overdubbed dialogue, David Lynch has made us privy to the veneer of things. It is all curiously two-dimensional and that puts the viewers on guard since surfaces are all they get. Lynch encourages the audience to examine those surfaces but always remaining detached enough for a disinterested critical view of what they are seeing. However, this two-dimensionality and flatness is also a deception. While the viewers think they are on their guard, superior to the cloying emotions of Hollywood wish fulfillment, Lynch relishes dropping the bottom out, showing the viewers just how unprepared and susceptible they are to emotions. Not content with the dreams that Hollywood has been feeding us, Lynch utilizes clich\u00e9d expectation to move us into the spaces films have yet to go, showing us the dangers and the hopes of believing.",

Each time I watch it, I think I glimpse what is actually going on but never quite get there. Nor should I. As a piece of cinema, I think there are few movies that are so genuinely creepy. Director David Lynch is the king of \"What-The-Fuckery\" and has the ability to make even the most normal, nondescript apartment complex look like some twisted, menacing version of the candy house from Hansel and Gretel. Just the opening of a handbag can make the viewer sweaty-palmed with tension at what will be revealed inside. Naomi Watts is superb as Betty in all her incarnations. The film has definite chapters with much of the initial plot surrounding Betty's arrival in Hollywood where she is staying in an apartment owned by her aunt. When she gets there, she finds a mysterious woman, Rita, in hiding. Rita claims to have been involved in an accident and has lost her memory so the pair begin to investigate what has happened. As clues are uncovered, the plot folds back on itself and things morph into something far darker and more surreal. The tense, unreal atmosphere is helped by a wonderfully sparse and effective score from Angelo Badalamenti that seems to pulse with the heartbeat as you watch. You get a real sense of Hollywood as a union of glamour and filth, a place that chews people up and spits them out without a care. Don't watch this movie and expect not to feel something. It will annoy, frustrate, entice and entrance. Just let it wash over you like an hallucinatory nightmare and go with it. \"Silencio\"",

            "content": "What is a 'good' movie and what is a 'bad movie? The answer depends on what the point of a film is. I choose to take the lens that movies are works of art, but that can itself create more questions than it answers. Not every filmmaker is trying to make art, just like every author isn't trying to win the Nobel Prize in literature. So which is worse: a mediocre 'artsy' film or an Adam Sandler comedy? The former may have artistic merit, but is poorly executed. The latter lacks deep substance, but accomplishes its goals of trying to be a broadly appealing, money making, forgettable comedy. In this circumstance the notions of 'good' and 'bad' become somewhat troublesome. \n\nThis has always been something I have thought about, but after watching Mulholland Dr. for the first time, the question has more weight. I have seen other David Lynch films in the past, but haven't particularly enjoyed them. I can sort of understand his cult following and why he is respected, but it just doesn't seem to be for me. After the BBC came out with a list of the best movies from the 00s as voted by critics and Mulholland Dr. topped the list, I thought it would be best to give Lynch another shot. For two thirds of the film I was on the precipice of boredom. I just didn't understand the appeal. The film is eccentric and weird and doesn't even have the counter balance of deep characters or breathtaking visuals to entice and engross. There were a few moments here and there that resonated with me, but overall it seemed like overwhelmingly mediocre.\n\nBut then something amazing happened. I will not go into detail, but once the movie was over once I had gotten the complete picture, suddenly everything made sense. The disjointed, almost incoherent collection of scenes suddenly all fit together. Mulholland Dr. is the very definition of being 'more than a sum of its parts'. So, the question arises: is it a good movie or a bad movie? I did not enjoy the experience for the most part. Then again film isn't meant to just be pure entertainment. Some movies are utterly depressing and there is an entire genre of film which purpose is to cause dread, fear, disgust, and revulsion. Does the non-enjoyability, the non-entertainment factor make these movies bad?\n\nDavid Lynch had a clear vision with Mulholland Dr. and he accomplished it masterfully.  I am still left wondering if perhaps there was a better way to go about it, something where the minute to minute of the film could've been more inviting. If you look at a painting, you aren't supposed to look at it square centimeter by square centimeter and judge those pieces separately and independently of the rest of the work. The same should be true about film. Of course there is inability with film to observe it all at once, but I think the film should be judged by its complete picture as a whole.\n\nIt is difficult to give a numbered rating to Mulholland Dr. Forgiving its 'faults' by saying 'that was the point' seems too easy, too dismissive. Yet not recognizing the brilliance of it by 'nitpicking' is also unfair. Though I would not say that his is the greatest film of the 00s, I am not surprised or disappointed that it topped the critics' list. It is a film with a clear, ambitious vision and a film that fully utilized visual medium (this story wouldn't be nearly as effective as a novel).",

            "content": "\u0093It\u0092ll be just like in the movies. Pretending to be somebody else.\u0094\n\nA recent poll by BBC Culture surveyed the opinion of film critics, academics, and curators from 36 countries across every continent which consisted of 177 of the worlds foremost movie experts. They were tasked to compile an international list of the top 100 films released since the year 2000 to come up the best film of this century so far. It's no easy task but when all was said and done, the film that topped the list was David Lynch's hallucinatory and meditative film-noir, Mulholland Drive. It came as a surprise to some but for those familiar with the film itself, it was a fitting accolade. \n\nAfter a car crash leaves her with amnesia, Rita (Laura Harring) has no idea who she is or where she's come from and wanders around the streets of Los Angeles in a daze. She eventually finds refuge in an apartment where she is found by ambitious young actress Betty (Naomi Watts). Betty and Rita then work together and investigate the mystery of Rita's condition and seek the answers to her true identity.\n\nIt's pretty much common knowledge now that Mulholland Drive was a failed proposal by Lynch to embark on a new television series. Originally conceived while filming Twin Peaks, it was to be a spin-off featuring the character of Audrey Horne (which was played by Sherilyn Fenn). Lynch went on to direct a 90min pilot for ABC but, in the end, the network executives rejected it. As a result, Lynch rejigged and regurgitated the material into a feature film and produced, arguably, his finest work to date. \n\nSo complex is Mulholland Drive that Lynch released 10 clues to help in deciphering the plot. It's in my opinion that these 10 clues are actually useless. Lynch notoriously doesn't explain his work and the clues he provides only serve as a false pretence in which to view the film. He toys with our perceptions and preconceived ideas of how a film should be constructed. I've viewed the film many times and the clues predominantly lead to a dead end. This is a film that demands numerous viewings and yet can still come out different each time. That is the sheer genius and craftsmanship that has went into it. There's a lot about the film that simply isn't explained; narrative arcs and characters appear and then disappear. This could have been intentional or it could have been the result of the material being planned for a long running TV show where they would've been explored in more detail. Either way, it works and adds to the hallucinatory vibe that courses throughout. It could be argued that the film is just a series of scenes loosely tied together and it's up to the viewer to interpret for themselves. Like Lost Highway, what the individual viewer brings to the experience is what they will walk away with. If you invest the time and respect to Lynch's vision, you will be richly rewarded. \n\nIt operates on many levels and the lines between fantasy and reality are constantly blurred. Some claim it to be a parallel universe, or repurposed elements to a person's failed past but the strongest interpretation is that it's predominantly a disconcerting dream state involving displacement and transference and where the reality and the fantasy intertwine.\n\nThe significance of the The Cowboy and his cryptic messages, the importance of the blue key and the blue box, the uneasy encounter with the man behind Winkies and the moment at Club Silencio where we are reminded that what we see isn't necessarily always real. All of these tie-in with the symbolic importance of dream imagery.\n\nIt can also be viewed as a cynical and scathing indictment of Hollywood culture - which could be a direct reference to the problems that Lynch has faced with studios in the past or even the issue that he faced in trying to promote this particular film as a TV show. At one point in the film, studio bigwigs try to influence a director's decision on whom he casts in his film. This was purportedly what Lynch faced by casting unknowns Watts and Harring in the lead roles here and one of the reasons that ABC rejected it (apparently they were too old). They couldn't have been more wrong, though, as Watts delivers masterful work. There are at least three different interpretations to her character and she nails every one of them. She showcases her extensive range which, considering the narrative of the film, ironically made her a Hollywood star overnight.\n\nForm over structure and the combination of sight and sound has always been a major attribute to Lynch's work and in Mulholland Drive, they are integral to the overall composition. Regular Lynch composer Angelo Badalamenti's haunting score compliments the uneasy mood and atmosphere created by Peter Deming's foreboding cinematography, lending the film a truly sinister and ethereal feel. \n\nThe biggest achievement though, is how much Lynch respects his audience's intelligence without compromising or diluting the concept. This is a visual jigsaw and putting it together is a very challenging endeavour. Many, if not all, viewers will find pieces that just don't to fit. That aside, this is still an intoxicating mystery and even when it's seemingly inexplicable it's still gripping and hugely involving. Those who like their narrative spelled out for them needn't bother but those that enjoy a challenge will be enthused throughout this fascinating piece of work. \n\nWe've all had those dreams where people, places and events are twisted and distorted and that's exactly what Lynch captures. There is a running, logical narrative that courses underneath it but it's very much delivered in dream logic. Any coherent interpretation lies within the importance of it's symbolism. \n\nWhen you consider Lynch's filmography over the years, this feels like the film that he has been building towards. All of his usual themes are on display; the psychological duality in an individual and the juxtaposition of innocence and corruption, beauty and depravity, shattered dreams and living nightmares. Put simply, it's an abstract masterpiece.\n\nMark Walker",

After watching the film, I was upset because I had endured 147 minutes of a disjointed \"art\" film. Having minored in cinema at university, I sat through a number of these productions and most of them were bad. However, I knew there was more to this than I could understand in one sitting and decided to reserve my judgement. As I read the multitude of online reviews praising this as a 10/10, and one the greatest film of all time, etc. I decided to make sense of what I just viewed.  Naomi Watts is brilliant as the protagonist.\n\nIt is clear to me that most critics and amateur reviewers simply find it easy to ascribe a \"perfect 10\" to this film so they don't feel out of place with the rest of the Bohemian, artsy mass consensus. I do not think this is nearly one of the greatest films of all time.  Then again, this is Lynch, and the viewer needs to understand that going into the movie.  He will taunt and design a mind warp because that is his signature and audiences that have become a cult following expect it.  Lych conveys a story and feelings in a radically different and unconventional style, which starkly contrasts the \"Hollywood\" fundamental of storytelling through the cinematic medium.\n\nWhat I find unnecessary is the disjointed plot and leaving the viewer to impossibly put the pieces together.  I read websites that try to explain this film and they still come up blank on most of the scenes, although the general story may be deciphered.\n\nWould this film stand up if it was simply told in a chronological manner like 99% of other films?  Likely not.  Perhaps this means the film is not that good and Lynch instead relies on the disjointedness to compensate.\n\nThis is the type of film that requires more than one viewing. Each time, one will respect it more as artwork and realize its subtle qualities. It does have one quality of a truly great and exceptional film - it lingers with the viewer well after watching.",

Lynch, strings and manipulates us to believe in a faux world and subtely clues, until we question everything and then begin to realize the reality, leaving us spell-bounded.",

The basic broad plot that I've come to believe the actual story is about is a woman finding another woman who was in a car accident that gave her amnesia and now they're both figuring out her past.  An intriguing enough story.  But then there are so many other scenes thrown in that in no way relate to this overarching story or actually contribute to it.  Some examples:  A random guy tells this other guy in Winkie's diner about a recurring nightmare, and then it turns out to be true.  That's it.  That's the scene.  Another scene:  The opening.  It's just people dancing for 1-5 minutes.  No relation to anything, just people dancing.  All the scenes involving the movie director I thought was going to connect with the story of the two women, and I really thought it was going somewhere when he saw the blonde girl Betty, but no, that's the full amount of interaction they go through, so really all of his scenes are thrown in there and not really relevant at all.  I'm not going to mention the last 1/3 or 1/4 of the movie because that's where the movie decides to throw all the pieces in the air and give them new names.  Betty becomes Diane, Rita becomes Camilla, everyone switches rolls, everyone gets new personalities, there's no correlation to anything else in the movie, it's all just a punch in the face to the people who paid enough attention that long and were finally starting to piece together some of the story.  It's a shame, I really enjoyed some moments in this, and I even for a moment believed the random quirks and scenes would somehow tie in.  But it doesn't.  Really, I think people just like it because they're afraid to actually admit it's nonsensical.  And that's alright for a movie to be nonsensical for the sake of being nonsensical, but the way this movie does it is that it feels like it's actually trying to go somewhere.\nIn conclusion, this is an artsy masterpiece wannabe.  Random does not equal smart, though many get suckered into thinking it does.  Just look at the tomatometer.",

            "content": "David Lynch's first love is painting. Despite being one of the most influential film-makers of this era, he still indulges in his paintings. It isn't beautiful by any means, but he is undeterred. \"We come across beautiful portraits many times in our life\",he quips, \"but how many do you actually remember?\". For David Lynch, any work of art which is unable to elicit any kind emotive response is a failure. Any response would do. His paintings are ugly, distasteful. But he considers that a success. \"At least my work manages to evoke some response, any response.\" For him, it is better that someone completely ignoring his work.\n\nIt is from the skewed mind of this unconventional film-maker that the 2001 psychological mystery thriller, Mulholland Dr. was conceived, first as a television pilot, then into a full length feature film. Released in 2001 at the Cannes Film Festival, the movie opened to one of the most polarized responses cinema has ever seen. The supporters saw the movie as a masterpiece, a one-of-its-kind-story by a film-maker at his best. The nay-sayers felt the movie was indulgent and an offense against narrative order. Lynch still won the Prix de la mise en sc\u00e8ne (Best Director Award) and got an Oscar nomination.  The British Film Institute's  prestigious Sight &Sound Poll in 2012 named Mulholland Dr. one of the greatest movie ever made.\n\nEven today, the movie polarizes both cinephiles and critics like no other. The internet is flooded with countless blogs, opinions and youtube videos attempting to explain the movie. The mystery has been compounded by Lynch himself, who believes that the movie is all about what you decipher from it. This has ensured that the aura around the movie is still intact even after 14 years.\n\nTo put it as simply as possible, Mulholland Dr. tells the story of young Betty Elms, an aspiring actress just arrived in Los Angeles, who befriends an amnesic woman hiding out in her aunt's apartment. In helping the woman, who calls herself Rita, understand who she is, Betty embarks on a terrifying adventure, which transforms her life. A normal mystery film, right? :D . Far from it! Interspersed along with this narrative are multiple vignettes, strange characters doing strange things, characters appearing and disappearing and scenes having no relation to the narrative. But at no point (initially) do you feel confused. There is a seamless flow between the scenes that you won't be affected by its lack of coherence. I honestly believed all the mysterious characters and events would somehow fit into the main narrative and everything would finally make sense. But how wrong I was! Well into the movie and invested into its characters, Lynch, in the last half and hour or so serves a surprise so powerful that I felt I had been hit on the head! Like the rug was pulled from where I was standing and I fell right on my face! It was the most terrifying experience that I had ever had while watching a movie. Everything that I believed was true was being proved wrong right in front of me, with me all helpless. And then the film ended, leaving behind a plethora of questions unanswered and my mind all disturbed.\n\nShock followed helplessness followed anger. Yes, I was angry. Angry that I was deceived. Deceived at a game thought I was good, and deceived fair and square. I had a virtually sleepless night, full of tossing and turning and terrifying nightmares. The next day, with my self confidence bruised, I decided to have a second viewing.\n\nAnd I was blown! Blown by the performances, blown by the script, the music, the direction and what not. I realized that I was having the best cinematic experience I ever had relished every ounce of it. Mind you, I was not even an inch closer to solving the mystery, but I realized that was how it was meant to be. Like a dream, where you wake up and is confused about what you saw and what it means. Now after multiple viewings, i have my own theories, but you are never sure! :)\n\nThe performances are unbelievable. Naomi Watts as Betty Elms/Diane Selwyn puts in a performance that will leave your mouth open. In portraying two contrasting characters, Watts has displayed extraordinary depth and understanding of what is expected of her. If not for anything else, The movie is worth watching for her incredible performance. There is a  scene where Betty is auditioning for a role in a movie. She has to perform a passionate scene with her character's father's friend. A movie scene within a movie scene, without even a kiss, the scene is one of the hottest I have ever scene and had the other character sweating in his pants. Watts' chemistry with Laura Harring is also commendable, most evident in their twin sex scenes, one of unbridled passion, and another spewing hatred. Let me mince no words in saying that Naomi Watts has produced the best ever female performance in cinema history. Period.\n\nLaura Harring also deserves praise for playing the dark haired femme-fatale to perfection. All the other supporting cast play their parts well. In a curious case of casting, Lynch casts dwarf actor Michael J Anderson as the powerful mob boss Mr Roque. But he is always on a wheelchair, and you won't realize he is dwarf. He was fitted with over sized prosthetic legs to give him the appearance of an abnormally small man.\n\nThe screenplay and dialogues are excellent to say the least. It is apparent that Lynch wanted to have a 1950s retro feel to the movie; a young impressionable aspiring actress arriving at \"the city of dreams\" to fulfill her ambition. Everybody is helpful to her and she is easily cast into a lead role! The perfect dream start to any actor. The cinematography also follows the trend, being both a parody of the old soap operas while retaining a neo-noir darkness. The editing is crisp and the transition from multiple story arcs is seamless and  fluid.\n\nIt would be blasphemous not to mention some exceptional scenes that this movie packs. For one, the famous Winkie's diner scene. A scene perfectly executed, it is the scariest experience I've ever had. That scene is technically brilliant and is a case in point for film students on how to execute a sequence. Here is a brilliant dissection of that scene. The club silencio scene too is brilliant. The most important plot twist in the movie occurs there and it is worth repeated viewings just for the mastery in its execution. Another brilliant scene is that of a meeting between the mob bosses and the filmmaker. The scene has excellent dialogue and brilliant acting. The tension in the air is defeaning and the animosity is impalpable. Brilliant.\n\nAngelo Badalamenti and David Lynch have a unique relationship. Starting from Blue Velvet, he has worked on the soundtrack of almost all of Lynch's films. And I have always believed he has always produced his best in Lynch's films. And he doesn't disappoint with Mulholland Dr.. He probably produces his darkest work yet, with contrasting the dark mystery of the Rita's identity with the bright cheerfulness of Betty's enthusiasm. Using Connie Stevens' \"16 Reasons\" and Linda Scott's \"I've Told Ev'ry Little Star\" was a masterstroke as it gave authenticity to the retro feel in parts of the movie. But what was indeed emotionally touching was the rendition \"llorando\" at the club silencio scene, the Spanish version of Roy Orbison's famous ballad \"crying\". Along with the leads, the song brings us to tears, while giving an emotional arc to one of the best cinematic scenarios.\n\nI had an advantage many people don't usually get, I knew nothing about the master class that is David Lynch before watching this movie. Nothing at all. So, the effect this experience had on me was unprecedented. Now, four months later, I have watched each of his ten feature films and his acclaimed Television series Twin Peaks. And my admiration for his genius has grown manifold. I believe with great conviction that he is one of the the greatest filmmakers ever and is my personal favorite. But Mulholland Dr. is his magnum opus - the movie he was working towards all his life. From the concept to the implementation, he takes us to the darkest corners of our subconscious leaving us emotionally drowned and naked. He has given new meaning to art that is cinema by not spoon feeding us and respecting our intelligence.\n\nOverall, Mulholland Dr. is more than a movie to me, it is an inspiration. It reinforced my belief in the power of cinema and inspired me to write about films. If I ever become a filmmaker, I would like to become someone like ( or at least close to) David Lynch, making movies with the same intensity that he does. Even cinematically, the movie is a revelation. It is a mystery, a psychological thriller, a surrealist movie, a neo-noir, a movie about hollywood and what more! But to me, more than anything else, it is a love story! Behind all the film noir and confusing mystery, there is a love story. One of hope, happiness and life. But like most romances, this is also a tragedy. A tragedy which tugs at you and will haunt you for the rest of your life. If you can watch one only one movie in your life, make it this one!\n\nObra maestro!",

            "content": "I've never been the best at understanding movies. I mean, I'm a big fan of them, and probably understand them thematically more than a lot of other people, but sometimes, I'll admit, I get confused about certain implications of a scene, or a plot twist, or just what's happened dramatically in the film. One need not know particulars about property and water ownership to enjoy Chinatown, but I'll admit that I got a bit tripped up trying to understand all the real estate stuff that was going on.\n\nMulholland Drive is a movie I was warned beforehand I would likely not understand. The first three quarters or so - it's kind of hard to tell how much of the movie was devoted to each section since it's weirdly structured - I understood everything that was going on, and though I couldn't yet tie everything together or solve the mysteries, I had faith that they would be solved and I would understand them. It was easy to juggle the various plot lines. But then that last quarter happened, and nothing was as it seemed to be, and I felt the familiar sensation of not understanding what was going on. So I can understand why people don't get it. I felt like I only had a vague idea of what the ending meant. Afterwards, though, I read some plot summaries online, and I realized that I DID understand the dramatic situation. Things I felt unsure about turned out to be right, so I'm actually hardly confused about the movie. Most of it can be summed up in a sentence: a woman named Diane is depressed after failing professionally and in her romantic life, so she constructs a complex dream, a sort of fantasy of what she wished was going on. Most scenes that don't seem to have a specific psychological function in the dream are simply side effects, other pieces from her life given random configuration in her brain, just like dreams actually work.\n\nUpon first finding out that the first two hours of the movie were a dream, I was a bit disappointed. There's always a danger when there's a big twist like that, because you get really invested in the plot, and the twist upends all of that. There's a part of me that wants to forget about the fact that it's all a dream and just find out why those mobsters(?) wanted Camilla Rhodes to get the part in the movie, or to find out Rita's true identity. Characters like the Cowboy were really interesting, and there's a certain degree of disappointment when you realize that there aren't going to be real answers to the questions posed at the beginning, within the context of this constructed narrative. We accept narratives in film as if they're real things that are happening, so in turn, we except the narrative within the narrative. It violates that implicit trust we have to upend that.\n\nMulholland Drive is different, though, I decided after some deep thought. First of all, there's tons of foreshadowing throughout, with Betty even saying she's in \"this dream place.\" The telegraphing is set from the first scene, in which a weird, psychedelic jitterbugging scene is shown, and there's an odd camera hovering over a sleeping figure (we later find out is Diane). This foreshadowing throughout is critical, because what first appears to be \"okay, really? That came from nowhere\" turns to \"surprising but inevitable.\"\n\nThe other big thing is that the first two hours are a pretty remarkable representation of a dream. There are plots that go dropped, and sequences interrupting the main story in odd ways. The viewer thinks these are subplots at the time, but you can imagine in Diana's head the way random scenes would be stuck between her main dream, just like real dreams. There are weird hallucinations, sexual fantasies, and semi-important characters who we later realize Diane may have met once and then repurposed for her dream. As an example, in the dream narrative, the main character is Betty, and she sees a waitress with the name Diane. In real life, this is flipped, and the waitress's name is Betty. So when Diane falls asleep that night, the first alternative name to call herself is Betty, since she vaguely remembers that name from somewhere. It's kind of brilliant. The main story may be more complex than an average dream, and more vivid, but it's probably the closest I've come to seeing a movie that actually depicts a dream in a pretty realistic way. That, ultimately, is what makes the ending of Mulholland Drive a spectacular twist instead of a cop-out.",

The images we receive, and seeing how the characters give and receive imagery, can be beautiful, disturbing, many times both. As per usual with David Lynch, his universe is truly his own -- Roy Orbison is the voice of God, one minor character can sense when reality is out of order, slapstick is the funniest style of humour, romance is never stable, and, most alluringly, the townspeople generally accept that there might exist a conspiracy or supernatural entity.

His career spanning from short nightmarish movies to oscar performance winners, from music videos to mind bending thrillers, oh and lets not forget Twin Peaks, the cult TV show due for a third season in 2016. Much like Twin Peaks, Mulholland Drive was originally a concept for another television show, however after it was denied, Lynch went ahead and turn his maniacal idea into a film. The outcome? A slick and twisted thriller, that begins as a tense fuelled roller coaster from hell and transends into an even deeper level. Betty moves to Hollywood in hope of fufilling her dream as an actress, until she can get on her feat her loving aunt puts her up in a lush apartment, while off on a film project of her own. Here Betty finds Rita, a victim of a serious and obscure accident, plagued with memory loss, Betty and Rita go on the hunt to find Rita's true identity. The further down the rabbit hole we go, we are introduced to a whole host of characters in this world, most notably Adam, a big time film director, who is having quite a day and a gun for hire, who just has the worst luck ever. All is nowhere as it seems and soon the female duo find themselves in a dangerous game, where both lives are at risk. The first hour of this film is really hard to adjust to if your not accuainted with previous Lynch outings, dialogue is cheesey and blunt. Images and metaphor run rampant throughout and at times you are left questioning your sanity. However as the film draws closer to its conclusion, like most of the best puzzles, everything slots right into place. The cast are all wonderful in bringing the erratic characters to life, Justin Theroux is hilarious and arrogant as the big shot director who just cant seem to get his way, his scenes deliver the comic releif and believe me, in this film its needed. Naomi Watts is Betty and she manages to play the part so over the top with innocence that you cant help but fall in love with her niavety for danger. Laura Harring also puts in a desperate and distraught tour de force with the character of Rita, subtle and brooding, she is the films anchor. The music by Angelo Badalamenti is haunting and spine tingling and really brings Lynch's world to life, enjoying flits of jazz from time to time to keep the beat going. Visually this film is like a mesh of Hollywood meets arthouse, its dizzying camera and obscure focus pulls merge wonderfully with gorgeous and noirish shots that really give this film a sense of polish and attention to detail. The film however does have one upsetting factor and thats its final act, not because its bad, in fact its the ending that makes you realize just how well crafted a film this is, however it becomes apparent that more time was meant to be spent fleshing out these characters and it becomes apparent that this would have enjoyed more success as a TV show. That aside, Mulholland Drive is a worthwhile and excellent addition to the Lynch collection, is it his best? No, but then who can be perfect all the time?",

            "content": "When I first watched the movie in 2001 I was still hoping Lynch had actually something to say, despite the disappointment with Wild at heart. I was surprised by the high rating and good reviews this movie got, but finally when I watched the movie again tonight on TV I got the point: hot, young, naked actresses and plenty of lesbian sex. Watts and Harring starring as the mysterious Rita and Betty go all the way, titillating the viewers with their antics.\n\nUndeniably, both Watts and Harring really did a good job with the absurd script they got. But the script remains absurd. My personal take is that Lynch had a grudge against the Hollywood establishment and the whole movie is supposed to prove some point, such as how directors are forced to choose actors, even when they would prefer to cast somebody else.\n\n\nIt is pointless to summarize the plot, since the movie switches into a different one two thirds into the story. Anybody can interpret the complete lack of logic in whichever way they want and then \"accuse\" whoever does not \"get\" it of being dumb. The point is, there is nothing to \"get\", apart from Lynch frustration, unleashed on paying audience, a plot that does not make any sense and a couple of good actresses, only one of them actually making a career out of this crappy movie.\n\n\nWhile Mulholland Drived propelled Watts into super stardom, Harring was left behind. Which seems unfair, but then again, perhaps fitting in Lynch's world where nothing makes sense. However, Mulholland Drive put me off Lynch's world once and for all.\nP.S. I like fictional stories to make some sort of sense, since I get plenty of absurdity from real life. I think authors could make an effort to churn out stories with a beginning a middle and an end, even if not necessarily in this order. Creativity does not necessarily imply messy, self-involved narrative.",

Moreover, the plot of the movie at first may seem ordinary but knowing its a David Lynch's film things are not always what they seem. Therefore the movie starts going many places and with different stories, but never bores you but it keeps you interested and amazed about this world this characters are. It's very fascinating to experience this movie and try to understand what's going on, even though you may never know, but by simply watching it it gives you a certain satisfaction because of how awesome and amazing this movie was, because it truly is a cinematic masterpiece like no other. \n~November 2, 2014~",

Once I did the same I like it, but I have no interest to watch it again, quite contrary to most of the suggestions. When all the ideas are put together, it fails to tell why the director has given a good role to the character played by Justin Theroux in the first half. The beginning of the film and it's first half were linear, but it got kind of messy after that, but once put in order, it becomes both a mystery film and a psychological one.

Everyone involved dies, except for one - a brunette in a black dress (Laura Elena Harring) that possesses looks that could kill with a perfectly timed bat of an eye lash and a shimmy of a hip.  Battered, bloodied, and bruised, she makes her way to a luxurious condo in Los Angeles, avoiding danger that she knows is around the corner.\n\tBetty Elms is an aspiring actress from rural Ohio.  When she arrives at LAX, there is a glimmering naiveness in her wide eyes that we can tell will surely be crushed - unless she actually is a soon-to-be-starlet.  As she is portrayed by Naomi Watts, it doesn't seem too far off.\n\tShe plans to stay at her wealthy aunt's flat while attempting to get a job, but as soon she sets her bags down she finds a woman in the shower, that woman being the brunette in a black dress that survived the car crash.  That woman is an amnesiac, who decides that her name must be Rita after seeing the poster for the famous Rita Hayworth vehicle, \"Gilda\".  \n\tMost would throw Rita out.  But Betty is a cute blonde who wears pink sweaters, and there isn't a mean bone in her body.  The two become friends and later lovers, but it appears that Rita may be in deeper trouble than we might think.\n\tBut then, Betty transforms into a bitter, cold woman named Diane, while Rita becomes Camilla, who takes pleasure in emotionally tormenting her girlfriend.  The previous story may not have been a mystery, but it feels like one.  We want to know what happened to Betty and Rita - yet at the same time, we can hardly wait to see what Lynch is going to give us next.\n\t\"Mulholland Dr.\" etch-a-sketches its way through several seemingly unrelated events about Hollywood, and the results are poisonous, deadly, but full of sleek neo-noir attitudes.  Many of Lynch's films have been interesting to watch but cold to the touch, but \"Mulholland Dr.\" may as well be his masterpiece.  Things are as disjointed as ever, but like his seminal TV series \"Twin Peaks\", there is enough mystery and enough human magnetism to draw us into a world of crime and corruption.\n\tThere isn't a plot to speak of, only terrific performances by a game cast and individual scenes that don't come together but make a lasting impression.  Depending on Lynch's mood, there is either surrealism, hot on display, or scenes pulsing with texture that could fit into any commercial film.  \n\tThe finest surreal piece comes from Betty and Rita's trip to a nightclub called the \"Silencio\", where they are given a show hosted by a supremely creepy ringmaster-y goon, starring a torch singer passionately lip syncing to song that makes Betty and Rita sob hysterically.  The finest real piece is shown through the former's audition for a role that she nails.  The scene is piping hot and full of sexual tension, but the second the casting director yells cut, we nearly forget that Betty was in an audition in the first place.\n\tThere is a flawless balance between the crazy and the professional - Lynch is able to establish enough characterization that his moments of wildness don't feel cloying.  He never gets carried away.  You could say that the film is like a passage through a tunnel in Lynch's brain.  On one side is Edward Hopper.  On the other is Salvador Dali.\n\tNormally, Lynch's style overcomes his actors' performances, no matter how good; but Watts, in her breakthrough role, has never been better.  Surely, actresses are set-pieces in Lynch's films - just look at Patricia Arquette in \"Lost Highway\", who seemed willing to do anything, yet played two women who felt a little bit too much like comic book femme fatales.  But Watts doesn't ever seem lost in a Lynch's vision: she commands every scene she appears in.  As Betty, she glows.  Betty's hopes and dreams may be as big as her eyes, but Watts doesn't make her a one-dimensional Sandra Dee act-a-like that we want to hate.  And Diane, who is a depressive Veronica Lake post-career type, is a much more difficult role, but Watts hits it right in the kisser.  She possesses such talent that she is the only actor in \"Mulholland Dr.\" that makes the scene all about her, not Lynch featuring her.\n\tRoger Ebert put it best when he said that \"Mulholland Dr.\" is a movie you \"surrender yourself to.\"  You can't walk in the door with a smart-alecky eye-brow arch; you have to leave your smarts and so-called intelligence at the door.  The film is a dreamy nightmare that engulfs you in its inexplicable jolts but hypnotizes you with its unpredictability.  David Lynch knows what he wants, and he gets it.",

Only few films could surpass the ambition that this film tries to strive for, and most of those films are among the likes of Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and Bergman's Persona.\n\nMulholland Drive, on its surface, tells a simplistic tale about a woman who has lost her identity and gains a help from a stranger, whom then develops a close bond with and embark on a journey that would ultimately affect both of their lives. This was my perspective of the film during my first viewing, and even with that, I was highly satisfied with what was given to me. It was thrilling from start to finish, conjuring up this air of mystery that I was so desperate to solve, by the end of the film I wasn't able to crack the case as I hoped but it definitely held my curiosity and desperation long after the film has ended. It has created a mark on my mind that keeps growing and growing, and each day that I delay a revisit pushes me to the edge of insanity, constantly trying to solve it basing it only with my initial experience of the film.\n\nI finally found time for myself to come back and visit Mulholland Drive, and this time I was determined to finally unravel Lynch's labyrinth, hoping to come out the other side understanding my experience and its purpose for existing.\n\nMulholland Drive is essentially a portrait of Hollywood, showing us the dark side of a place that is synonymous to fame, beauty and art. The film follows two women and their adventure takes us to the deepest and darkest parts of Hollywood, showing us the wickedness of the business and how it could break up relationships that one could easily mistake as unbreakable. Lynch doesn't hold back on his style but at the same time he ensures that his style remains relevant to the ideas and tone that he is trying to get across. The way he depicts the businessmen in Hollywood felt more real than what is actually shown in other films, and though the interactions between characters do come off as unorthodox, especially if one isn't used to the Lynch's aesthetic, it still captures the cruel and corrupt minds of these men.\n\nThe real meat of Lynch's tale is the dark journey one goes through when a fresh face enters the \"land\" of Hollywood, which in this case would be Betty/Diane. She is the pure example of a person who strives in the career in acting because initially for the love of the craft and to make a name for themselves in the business, but then loses their sense of innocence with the development of romantic relationships and the unjust ideals of the film business. This was an aspect of the film that was slightly blurred during my initial run through, as most of my focus was on trying to orient myself to the film's time and place and I was still taking in details of characters in order to understand each one's intentions and purpose. My theory for the film's first and second act is that Betty/Diane is dreaming of her past, her expectations, and her plans. It speaks so much about the character, and this was more obvious during my second viewing, by the end of the film we truly understand how tortured this character is. The parallels of the third act with the first two acts may not be clear at first but once you watch it understanding that it is told in Betty/Diane's perspective then the film delivers a more impacting experience.\n\nLynch sets the film out in a way that is definitely jarring and slightly frustrating during its first run through, but this issue is more to blame on the viewer for being impatient. The film requires multiple visits as Lynch assembles his film, especially during the film's final 25 minutes, in disorganized fragments; there were times that I felt the film's resolution was a recall to Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, providing a third act that doesn't explain itself and requires the perspective of the viewer to fuel its strength. The only way to have one's mind be aligned with the film's difficult storytelling is to provide the film the attention it deserves. One needs to constantly search for the little details in order to even remotely understand the small but significant scenes. Lynch isn't the type of guy, who would spoon-feed the film's story, and once a person is aware of this, then it is then one could gain a more satisfying experience.\n\nThough I now consider this as one of the best films of all time, I still don't comprehensively understand it; scenes like the one that took place in Silencio is still not particularly clear to me, but I my grasp definitely got tighter as compared to my initial viewing. There is definitely an emotional and spiritual core present in these scenes that I haven't quite reached yet, and the closer I get to it, the more satisfied I become.\n\nPeter Deming's cinematography was brilliant. He has produced a hypnotic and dreamy style that establishes the film's tone and atmosphere, and still retaining that Lynch-ian quality that sets his films apart from other filmmakers. The photography's top achievements would be the horror driven scenes which includes, the event at Silencio and the film's ending, where dark and gloomy blues just dominate the shots.\n\nAngelo Badalamenti has worked on many of Lynch's films, and his score for Mulholland Drive is arguably his best. One can immediately indicate that the score is by Badalamenti as it contains this sense of creepiness to it that other composer have failed to achieve. Only in rare occasions do the score dominates the film, and when it does it doesn't come off forced or manipulative. Badalamenti is more concerned with creating that sense of uneasiness in the atmosphere, not knowing what could be lurking in the next corner and hyping up the horror even in the most stable and simplistic scenes.\n\nThe film's acting is carried by both Naomi Watts and Laura Harring, playing Betty/Diane and Rita respectively. Both actresses dominated the scenes they were in, shaping their characters exactly the way Lynch has expected them to and ensuring their performances heightens the film's ideas and connects with the film's style rather than displaying a sense of ego and proving to us that their acting is \"natural\" and \"effective\". Both of these actresses display strong chemistry with one another and this chemistry allows intimate scenes to bloom which immerses us in their relationship. If this connection wasn't well established, then the film would have easily fallen apart and come off as lifeless. Justin Theroux as Adam Kesher was surprisingly great in the role. I expected a wooden or shallow performance from the actor but he was able to insert some personality to the character, even if it doesn't challenge and pushes the actor's abilities to the limit.\n\nMulholland Drive is a masterpiece and has welcomed me to Lynch's filmography with open arms. This film was so great that it would be difficult for me to separate my feelings towards this film when reviewing the director's other films. This is definitely a film I would immediately recommend to anyone when they ask for films to watch as I personally believe that everyone needs to at least give this film a watch at least four times in their lives.",

It is a deliberately confusingly structured film that dives head first into a heady mix of conventional noir, hollywood satire, existentialist horror, philosophical musings,  To break down the core dual narrative of the film based on it's late game twists and character outlines would be a massive disservice to the odd, unsettling, funny, painful, ODD experience of actually watching it.  I will not touch on the plot as there is almost no plot explanation that can happen without ruining some aspect of the film.  It is comprised of two major acts (dual narrative) and a series of seemingly unrelated metaphorical scenes, and semi related surrealist scenes that comprise a very skewed and unsettling whole.  Perhaps the thing I enjoyed most about Mulholland dr. in comparison to Lost Highway or TP. Fire Walk With Me, is that Lynch never seems to take all of this too seriously, even when tugging the heart strings or delving into horror.  This film walks a dangerously fine line between hollywood meta-commentary and satire, and outright noir thriller/horror, without ever completely becoming either.  Following a couple of twists, the final act of the film becomes nearly laughably absurd, as the already confusing reality/dream/metaphor timeline becomes even more obscured in a series of nightmarish yet campy scenes.  The film ends on a note where I didn't know whether to laugh, cry, shit myself, or pretend I never saw it.  At the end of the day Mulholland Dr. works on many levels, as a surreal rollercoaster ride, as a puzzling noir, as an extended dream sequence, as a satire, yet never as a conventional narrative; if you are a viewer who values the journey more than the destination, then hop on board the crazy train.",

Un Chien Andalou, the paintings of Salvador Dali, and even Lynch's own Lost Highway are in my opinion some of the greatest works of art to be released. I just don't like it when it's thrown in at the last minute like in Mulholland Drive. It's an outstanding mystery film for about an hour and a half, and if it had stayed that way, then I would consider this to be one of my personal favorites and one of the most atmospheric and well-directed films ever made since 2001: A Space Odyssey. However, about ten minutes before the ending, a weird twist involving a box and what I think might be a parallel universe happens and it feels as if Lynch just got bored writing it and decided to use the ending to a different movie instead (the actors are literally playing different characters with different names and different personalities, the plot goes from a missing identity noir to a lesbian love story, and there's an incoherent mythology thrown in for the hell of it). Perhaps if I saw it again, I might see what Lynch is going for, but at this moment, it just seems lazy and incoherent.",

David Lynch cobbles episodes from his cancelled TV show with newly filmed footage, and stirring up a ground-breaking masterpiece with colorful, dizzying, and mysterious editing. Mulholland Drive is one of the rare occasions where you are frozen in awe after watching a film that is beyond definition and unlike any other film ever made. Naomi Watts and Laura Harring maintain the film's mystery giving real performances that benefit from Lynch's complex writing of characters. Mulholland Drive is the first film that feels like a dream, and equally, makes you as frustrated when it ends as when an excellent dream does. If you love 50's era Hollywood,watch this film immediately! Lynch evokes the classic feel of Sunset Boulevard without making it a period piece, and contemplates on the difficulties of having a successful career in Hollywood.",

            "content": "After finishing all of Twin Peaks and watching the mesmerising Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me, I was in desperate need of more David Lynch. And since the concept of a surreal Neo-noir sounded so original, it seemed like the ideal choice.\nI can honestly say that although some of the surrealism proved a little too mesmerising for me, I did enjoy Mulholland Drive for many of the same reasons I had enjoyed Twin Peaks, mainly for its dark and glamourous atmosphere.\nAlthough I can honestly say that I have so many questions from Mulholland Drive that I am annoyed not to have answered since I didn't connect to the characters as well as I did to the characters in Twin Peaks, and that it was a little too much of an experience in certain parts which made it difficult to remember what story aspect went in what chronologically appropriate place. And part of the is because the complicated production behind the film, since it was intended to be a TV series but ended up as a film. So Mulholland Drive has a lot of questions that it may or may not have intended to answer if it was turned into a TV series, but people who can't stand not knowing will find it to be too awkward or senseless to understand. To a certain extent I felt that, but bot enough to prevent me from enjoying the film. \nMulholland Drive is some of David Lynch's finest work since Twin Peaks, because while the story has no guarantee of being sensible to viewers, it's what you'd have to expect from David Lynch, so fans of his will appreciate the glamourous intensity and utter darkness draped around the story in Mulholland Drive and his great directional work.\nFrankly, Mulolland Drive is an example of a film that you will never understand but that you will like. If not for its surrealism, then for its excellent film style which benefits from an eerily intense atmosphere thanks to a darkly musical score, as well as haunting cinematography and grim lighting which all pay influence to the excellent visual style of the film. Mulholland Drive is an unforgettably haunting visual experience, and David Lynch proves that his talent continued on Ito the 2000's.\nAnd Naomi Watts proves what makes her a talented actress in Mholland Drive, combining the image of her sexual innocence with her character's intellectual innocence, both of which are broken as she delves into the darkness of the Hollywood outskirts and she begins to experience the life of luxury and pleasure. She works well as a symbol of a human changing into a Hollywood person in Mulholland Drive, and combined with the surrealism of the film it assists in showing the darkness that a person becomes embalmed by when giving their lives over to materialism and pleasure. She manages to show off everything she has as an actress and as a woman, and as an Australian it gives me pride to see an Australian actress like her making such an ambitious move.\nLaura Elena Herring also does a great job because she casts a strong sense of mystery over the entire film and assists in shrouding it into mystery and darkness, as well as sharing a strong chemistry with Naomi Watts which is an interesting blend of dramatic and erotic. She gives that haunting yet hypnotic presence that is common in David Lynch works, and every time she graces the screen, things instantly become mysterious, and so she works to ensure the dark exhilaration of Mulholland Drive is all in tact.\nJustin Theroux also manages to make an impact, considering that even though his character doesn't get much time on screen he still manages to show off how acting stoic can also prove to be a strong form of physical acting, more specifically in his facial expressions than anything.\nAnd lastly, Michael J. Anderson's mostly unseen presence is nostalgic and so twisted yet so great for a David Lynch film.\n\nSo Mulholland Drive is a creepy and mysterious surreal piece from David Lynch at some of his most recent best, even if it's sometimes too mesmerising for viewers.",

Good night\"\n\nMulholland Drive is considered by many one of the best films of the last decade (2001-09) and among David Lynch's best work. There is no denying that Lynch is one of today's most revered directors, but this is actually the first film of his that I've been able to see. Unfortunately I wasn't able to enjoy this movie as much as everyone else did and I'm ashamed to admit that Lynch is way to smart for me. While watching this film I felt that there were several scenes that didn't make much sense and that the director was just being pretentious showing his craft and great skills, but after reading the Hulk's critique of this film explaining every single detail in the movie I have to admit that Lynch was a genius and I just didn't get the movie in the same way others did. Looking back I realize that every scene has a meaning and the film is rich in symbolism and semiotics. Despite paying attention to the film I missed very important things that I can now see were really thought out by Lynch. I feel ashamed because I wasn't able to grasp the film in the same way Lynch would have wanted me to and I felt everything was pointless. The performances in this film are really great but I was never drawn into the film in the same way others were. I guess I'm not someone who cares too much about dreams or puts too much thought into them and their underlying meanings. What I did enjoy about this film were the satirical elements introduced by Lynch about the film industry in Hollywood. The characters were really well developed and the mood of the film is suspenseful at times. I also enjoyed the score of the film and thought it really added to the overall eeriness of Mulholland Drive. I might enjoy this film more if I watch it again now that I have understood most of the underlying meanings and symbolisms here, but I just can't gather myself to watch it again because I was never absorbed by the story and found everything rather dull.\n\nBetty (Naomi Watts) is a young aspiring actress who has just arrived at Hollywood from a small Canadian town. Her aunt, a successful actress herself, has allowed her to stay at her home while she is off shooting a movie. When Betty arrives at her apartment she is surprised to find out that there is a young woman already there. This beautiful brunette is suffering from amnesia after surviving a terrible car accident right before she was about to get murdered and has decided to hide in the apartment after seeing Betty's aunt leave. She thinks her name is Rita (Laura Harring), but she can't remember anything else. Betty decides to help her and allows her to stay with her. In the meantime there are a few other stories taking place. On the one hand we have a director (Justin Theroux) who is looking for a lead actress to replace the one that has disappeared. The producers want to force him to choose Camila Rhodes (Melissa George), but he refuses. There are also a series of detectives (Robert Forster and Brent Briscoe) trying to solve a murder, and a hit man (Joe Messing) who is a little inept at his job. All these stories seem to overlap each other as everything is connected, but at the same time not everything is what it seems as the line between dreams and reality is a very thin one.\n\nI love films that aren't told in chronological order like this, but I had trouble here putting all the pieces together. Now that I was able to understand it all I can see how brilliant Lynch was using all these different imageries. This is a film about transferring guilt and romanticizing love in an otherwise cruel and dark world. Lynch is always in control of his craft here, but he was way ahead of me and truly lost me. Naomi Watts had a breakout performance here, and she is now one of Hollywood's best known actresses, but this will be the role many will remember her for. Laura Harring is also great here as the needy and vulnerable character that Betty wants her (or fantasizes her) to be. Mulholland Dr. is a very complex and thrilling mystery that begins to make sense long after you've seen it. Is succeeds in the fact that the images stay with you and haunt you, but I really didn't have a pleasurable experience watching it. This is a very ambiguous film and Lynch has written a fabulous screenplay, but one that I wasn't prepared for. This is a very dark film that plays out as a contemporary film noir. Lynch was nominated as best director for his work here, but surprisingly it didn't receive any other nomination in 2001. The film has garnered cult status over the years and I understand why. I'm a little disappointed with myself for not enjoying this as much as I should have.\n\nRating: 5.9/10",

There is no denying that Lynch is one of today's most revered directors, but this is actually the first film of his that I've been able to see.

            "content": "David Lynch is unconventional filmmaker, and people agree to put him in categories like \"dark\", \"oddball\" or even \"ultraweird\".  This surrealist neo-noir movie, written and directed by David Lynch is again following the style which will fit in these categories. Perfect cast for such a movie: Justin Theroux, Naomi Watts, and Laura Harring, fits well and has the right chemistry. In juxtaposition of clich\u00e9 and surreal, nightmares and fantasies, the director is telling us, in nonlinear story lines, a story of an aspiring actress named Betty Elms, newly arrived in Los Angeles, California, who meets and befriends an amnesiac hiding in an apartment that belongs to Elms's aunt, famous retired actress. \r\n\r\nI really thought that almost everything in the first two thirds was close to perfect: camera work, sound and lighting, music, the movie even challenged me to suspend belief of what I am experiencing... until the last part where everything was blown away for me!  I know, you'll say, this is David Lynch, he does things his own way, but really reminded me on my grandma's little story when she wanted to say that someone staffed up the things... she used to compare those people to a cow which gives you 30 litres of milk a day, but at the end kicks the container and spills everything on the ground! That's how I felt David Lynch did it with this movie!  I was enjoying the \"milking\" (the building of the suspense and story- telling were simply amazing) but at the end I felt thirsty for a solid ending instead of the mambo-jumbo wanking. \r\n\r\nLynch is surrealists, and his language of the unexplained is the fluid language of dreams... but there was no sense at the end. When Lynch declined to offer an explanation of his intentions for the narrative, I really think that he had no explanation, because he himself had no idea how to finish it effectively and at the end he choose to hide under the \"art\" umbrella. Just my opinion...\r\n\r\nI enjoyed the work of David Lynch but at the end I felt like cheated, someone described it as \"pulling the rug out from under us\".",

I couldn't live with myself, but there must be.\n\tI'm alluding to the disjointed narrative woven through David Lynch's writing and directing. His use of different shooting styles and camera angles is pretty amazing.\n\tFor some reason it has a very 90's feel to it, despite its theatrical release in 2001.\n\tThe film runs a little too long and is thoroughly confusing. It's not 'intentional obfuscation for the sole purpose of confusing the audience.' That's misleading, and I don't think it happens all that often.\n\tFor years, I would have argued the pointlessness in the ending of Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. I still contend that it's an overall bore, and the dull slog is not worth the thoughtful and rather brilliant implications of the ending. It's perplexing as all get out, but now that I've read about what Stanley was going for, I can appreciate the virtue of his intent.\n\tAlthough I'm not a big fan of Blue Velvet, I appreciate what Lynch tries to do in his movies. \n\tEven after understanding the common interpretations of the plot, there still remains a feeling like something's missing. It's very similar to how I felt after Blue Velvet, but my preference lies with Mulholland Drive.\n\tMD was originally conceived as a television show, and this is where much of the plot falls apart. Lynch had to compact a narrative intended for an entire season into a feature film. Many question whether the final film can be classified as a complete narrative.\n\tI wish I could answer that question. I'm not sure and have done too much research already. Perhaps I'll get back on that some day.\n\tI had to have the answer, and felt satisfied by it. I'm not necessarily ecstatic about the explanation but it works, and it's fine; an original idea at the very least. I found the plot development compelling regardless.\n\tHey, I got a thing for elaborate high-stakes storytelling. I find it thought provoking and puzzling. I enjoy the whirlwind of disjointed moments, the coil and release of the tension spring.\n\tI adore the chase for comprehension, the errant cuts, the inexplicable in the real, the terror and indecision. Keeping the viewer on the edge of their seat certainly counts for something.\n\tMulholland, I find, is reminiscent of Robert Altman's Short Cuts from 1993. Except not nearly as boring.\n\tIt gives off a bit of a Pulp Fiction vibe (particularly in terms of the disjointed narrative). \n\tI'm also reminded of Sharon Stone's character in Basic Instinct with Laura Harring's role as Rita. They're both portraits of the typical femme fatale who sexually prey on their victims.\n\tNaomi Watts is great in MD; she's playing a difficult role here and executes it convincingly. Really, I mean, this is some tough stuff!\n\tOverall, I enjoy Mulholland Drive. It's ghostly, ethereal and compelling. The material's gritty and tense, but befuddling.\n\tDespite the incomplete narrative, Lynch offers his audience a thought provoking experience unlike any other.\n\tNonetheless, the story is mysterious and enticing, and if you like movies it's worth a shot.\n\tI'm finishing this review the following morning, and still thinking about it.\n\tWhat does that say about the film as a whole?",

Even conceding that the painfully sonorous performances during the first third of the movie are purposely contrived (at least, one would hope so; if that is not the case, they simply become embarrassingly neophyte), Lynch's impenetrable narrative includes countless vignettes. Intrinsically poor they are not, but while they add colorful neo-noir visuals they hardly add up to more than the sum of their parts. It's interesting and experimental, but also frustratingly vague and not nearly as erotic as it wants to be. Furthermore, the perpetual avant-garde symbolism isn't titillating so much as tiring. It's a bit of a disappointment.",

She meets an aspiring actress (Naomi Watts) who tries to help her find her origination, which leads them down a strange and dark path. The other story concerns a director's life (Justin Theroux) who is blackmailed into accepting the application of unknown actress or facing the alternative of getting into deep trouble. Another small plotline also concerns a hit man (Mark Pellegrino), the one behind the near killing of the amnesiac woman, who commits three acts of murder, which includes two innocent bystanders, and then just disappears. Such a weird story warrants a definite viewing from all viewers who like strange mysteries with REALLY disjointed narrations. Well-acted and includes a pretty memorable lesbian love scene.

A perfect film anyone can watch even if they don't understand the hidden meaning behind it. This film almost achieves this. I will state that the first three quarters of this film are some of the greatest film making I have seen of all time. The story is fantastic, if a bit confusing at times, the acting is spectacular, you really want to see what happens to these characters and you are interested in what they pay off might be. But then the last quarter of the film happens. Suddenly the last quarter happens and everything I stated earlier gets thrown out the window and every metaphor and artistic expression David Lynch was holding back was thrown into the quarter, making the film so confusing that it was incredible hard deciphering what was happening, who was who, what was reality. Even once the film had ended I thought I had an idea of what happened in the ending, but I still wasn't one hundred percent sure because of other things in the film. Upon finishing the film and thinking the film over I had to read around three different thesis papers on what actually happened in the film, to which I found out that I was somewhat right. And I say somewhat because there are some parts in the film that other people just have no clue what it ment, such as the blue box. Upon finding out what the ending really ment I really, really, really liked this film. The ending is amazing if you understand it. But that is the films biggest problem, this film came out in 2001, when the internet was still blooming as a flower and I can't imagine finding these papers online back then. If I was not able to figure out the film's ending, I think I would have liked this film a lot less. So it is really a 50/50 review. If you can understand the ending, or are going to take time out of your way to figure out the ending later, you will love this film. If you can't figure it out you will most likely not enjoy this film because it is impossible to make sense of the ending without trying to figure it out.",

The import of the story is near inscrutable, but there are enough bracing images to make it worthwhile. Like most of Lynch's post-Blue Velvet output, it's a collage of sexuality, violence, and malevolence with the logic and comprehensibility of a dream, compelling but hard to grasp. I still prefer Blue Velvet and Twin Peaks to everything else he's done, but I'll be back before long. Lynch does imcomprehensible and bizarre with more style and flair than most avant-garde leaning filmmakers.",

It is like a puzzle that you can distinguish that all the pieces somehow fits together, but once put together, it still remains a mystery. There is more symbolism as opposed to a concrete meaning. This is a cerebral film that requires the viewer to be analytical, yet at the same time be open to many interpretations.\n\nThat is the beauty of this film. This is art and while the film is really good, I'm still left pondering. I could imagine every viewer will arrive at a different interpretation and I feel David Lynch's intention while making this film was to encourage people to come up with their own explanations. This film is bound to leave one very puzzled upon their first viewing, but upon further analyzation, there is a symbolic relationship that ties everything together. If you are still lost, I think the key thing to pay attention to is the cowboy. For some reason, that really helped me a lot in finding some sort of logical explanation for the events that occur in the film.\n\nWhile I really do not know if there is a moral presented (or a point), to me, this film represents the demons that people have in the back of their minds. It's the elephant in the room that people don't want to confront or how one becomes in denial of its existence and how there is a good way to do that, as well as a bad way, but either way it has to be confronted. That to me seems to be what this film spoke about. Coupled with a foreboding atmosphere and odd imagery, this is a disturbing piece of high quality cinema that is shrouded with an aura of mystery bound to leave an imprint on one's psyche. I would definitely watch this again not just to learn more about the world created in this film, but to also be immersed in it again. 5/5",

            "content": "In my review of Lynch's previous \"Blue Velvet,\" my frequent complaint was that while I considered the film a rewarding experience; Lynch's continual interplay between the levels of the artificial and the morbid undercurrents of what looms beneath situated his film, thematically, as being too obvious. Lynch's film was utterly compelling when he entered his internal surrealistic landscape - and by returning to the surface the film ultimately lost its momentum. However, Lynch successfully rectifies such problems with his surrealistic masterpiece \"Mulholland Drive.\" A film that takes us into Lynch's realm of a L.A nightmarish landscape; and rather than continually giving the audiences room to exhale by traveling back to the surface of a normal reality; Lynch just keeps digging until, as an audience, we are stranded in an accumulation of surrealistic imagery with nowhere to go. As with a film that contains such ambiguity; there have been many hypothesis' created to explain its logic - but do films always need a sense of logic? If \"Mulholland Drive\" contained all the answers, would the experience be better? Would've you and your friends been left in such a bewildering, confused state that you spent the next three days trying to make sense of what you just seen if the answers were viable? The answer is: No. For that sole reason, Lynch's efforts are amazing. To watch such a film you must leave logic at the door and simply immerse yourself in the mesmerizing imagery and music to be treated by an experience like no other.  \n\nThe story follows as so: A woman is involved in a car wreck. Seemingly delusional, she finds solace within the help of a hopeful Hollywood uprising star as they embark on journey for answers that takes them through the realms of reality/dreams and memories.\n\nLynch riddles his latest efforts with morbid visuals and humor that revolves around a number of core characters (if they actually exist or not it's difficult to tell). Obviously there is Betty (Watts), the protagonist, who has hopes in becoming the next Hollywood hopeful. Funny enough; Lynch characterizes Betty with peculiar characteristics: she inhabits wooden dialogue that resembles soap-opera principles and evokes the traits of the Hitchcock heroine. Then there's Rita (Harring), a woman who suffers amnesia from her car accident and seems to be constantly transfixed within a delusional/emotional state. Lynch portrays their relationship in an eroticism fashion of two seemingly obsessive persona's to the point where it's difficult to tell whether their relations actual exists or is simply a protection of Watts subconscious. In fact, this train-of-thought fits for many characters: the Cowboy (Montgomery), the director (Theroux), Coco (Miller) and Camilla (George) all seem to have a purpose - and while I do consider to have an answer to their inclusions, an answer would be superfluous due to the fact that the film is simply too ambiguous. Speaking of characters, Naomi Watts performance is simply amazing to watch with the transition of the two separate spheres within dreams and reality. She effortlessly portrays the soap-operish conventions for two-quarters of the film, and then dramatically/disturbingly switches to the emotional wreck that has lost her innocence (wink, wink).\n\nLikewise to \"Blue Velvet,\" it's quite astonishing just how much tension Lynch is able to create, as sense of dread looms around each corner of Hollywood's nightmarish landscape. With the brilliant use of continues POV shots, Lynch is able to create tension within the most subtle moments. Such an atmosphere lends to Lynch's commentary of the modern Hollywood climate: a world that has portrayed its initial values and has cemented individuals with limited autonomy. It sorta works as warped 'Sunset Boulevard.\"\n\nHowever, the most impressive aspect of Lynch's latest efforts is that he portrays -quite possibly the most difficult aspect within all art aesthetics- the subconscious thoughts within the viewer's awareness. Similar to the likes of Bergman and William Faulkner's literature masterpiece \"The Sound and Fury,\" Lynch displays macabre internal thoughts through a visual medium; beautifully displayed through the final forty minutes sequence; a sequence that cements a moment that Lynch's whole career has been moving towards. In relation to my previous statement, \"Mulholland Drive\" final segments accumulates a sense of surrealism and macabre visuals that simply hypnotizes you within a sequence that resembles the characteristics of a nightmare; and if you are willing to surrender yourself to such sequences, you'll be treated to a transcendent experience like no other.",

            "content": "**** out of ****\r\n\r\nAfter one has seen David Lynch's \"Mulholland Drive\", the word \"Silencio\" has become one of the most haunting words in cinema since those spoken by Marlon Brando (\"The horror...the horror\") in \"Apocalypse Now\". It might be an irrelevant comparison overall, but both are films that linger in the corners of our minds. Both are less than conventional even if Lynch exists more on his own terms than Francis Ford Coppola ever did (although he is a fine filmmaker; his films can be enjoyed by pretty much all audiences with an attention span). He continues to surprise me as an artist; his films may all contain similar traits, but not one of them is truly \"similar\" to another. Lynch has enough feelings and images inside of him to inspire a respectable filmography; and so they have.\r\n\r\nA black car drives along a winding highway not too far from Los Angeles carrying a mysterious yet beautiful dark-haired woman (Laura Harring). The driver pulls a gun on her and orders her to step out of the car. She seems confused to just what is going on, although it's not until some kids crash into their vehicle with their own and leave everyone but her for dead that we realize how normal things were before. She, still unnamed, walks into the darkness and finds her way to the city. She rests up at a random house. The next day, she is discovered while showering by the occupant of the apartment that she has stumbled to. That person is Betty (Naomi Watts), the daughter of an actress (who owns the apartment but is away on business) who aspires to follow in her mother's footsteps.\r\n\r\nThe black-haired woman, who identifies herself as Rita after seeing a poster for Hayworth's \"Gilda\" hanging in the bathroom, is an amnesiac. She can't remember who she really is. She and Betty look for clues in her purse but find only a blue key and a shit-load of money. They hide both of these things in a container that rests in the closet. The two are then engaged in a sort of relationship that keeps getting weirder and weirder; in part because it's so often interrupted by what seem like little vignettes in between, one involving a Hollywood director (Justin Theroux) and his partnership with a pair of mobster brothers (one of whom cannot be pleased by a cup of espresso) who apparently own the next movie he's making, insisting that he cast a woman named Camilla Rhodes.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, the film balances these two stories; although there are even smaller ones that fit themselves in there somehow as well. For instance, there's an early scene set at the diner called Winkies in which a young man describes to his older colleague a dream that he had involving a frightening man in the back of the diner, which becomes a sort of nightmarish reality by the end of the scene. And then there's a sub-plot involving an amateur hitman who may or may not have ties to the car crash at the beginning of the film. And then there's the Cowboy. It's confusing even for a David Lynch film but better because of it. The labyrinth-like structure of the narrative, which I assure you forms a coherent whole by the end but only if you pay attention and watch it more than once, is appealing to me.\r\n\r\nCertain plot details are vital to how you interpret \"Mulholland Drive\". As usual, Lynch encourages each individual viewer to think for themselves; thus interpretation is key to the enjoyment of the film. Betty and Rita get tangled up in a romantic, sexual relationship somewhere within the last hour; and this is one element that plays a significant role in how I view the film. There's a common theory floating around that Rita is some sort of dream projection of the sort of person Betty would like to be, and that the film itself is all a dream. By the time it was over on my second viewing, I knew that was the theory I'd adopt. I also view it as a satire of this generation's cerebral dreams of fame and fortune; the Betty character is all that materialized into one silly blonde. Watts' performance is uncanny and over-the-top; although in the last act, surprisingly intense as well.\r\n\r\nFor someone to truly hate the film, I think it would either take too much thought or too little. I didn't allow myself to think too much into \"Mulholland Drive\" since I'd seen Lynch films before, and so I knew that you simply can't understand everything he puts on screen. You just have to kind of go with it, which is easy for me to do when a director is so passionately emotive and gifted in setting up an atmosphere with unforgettable imagery. \"Mulholland Drive\" has so much of that. Take, for instance, the employer of the mobster brothers who sits in a wheelchair in a dark room illuminated only by a single light (which shines on him) and talks through a microphone that connects to the inside of a glass cage of sorts, where the employees can speak to him through. And then there's the Rebekah Del Rio scene, which is just sublime. Finally, you've got a superb Angelo Badalamenti score to complete the ambience.\r\n\r\nI love David Lynch's technique because he makes films so unconventional, surreal, and beautiful that they cannot be summarized as easily as most films. Is \"Mulholland Drive\" a mystery? Perhaps, we don't know for sure. Like everything else in the picture, it all depends on how you're seeing it. Either way, Lynch puts YOU in the role of detective and to me, that's more fun than anything else. His images and emotions are so resonant that the viewer - depending on what kind you are - has no problem with what Lynch is asking us to do. This is clearly one of his most multi-dimensional and personal films; a stunning evocation of present day LA and the different vibes that Lynch got, and still gets, from the place that he calls home. If its goal is to be chaotic, destructive, dream-like, disturbing, funny, and ultimately mind-boggling; then it's done the city justice.",

            "content": "It dares to go there, all the way.\n\n\nOriginal 2012 Review:\n\nFrom what I've gathered thus far, this is a director's heightened, darkened, paranoid Hollywood memoir.  Everything about this film is from the point of view of a Hollywood director who is saying something about artists working for 'the man,' the envy and desperation they're forced into, the mold that they have to cut pieces of themselves away to fit into.  Diane (or Betty, however you choose to look at it) begins her journey to Hell in the prologue (this is all very similar to my own Death Odyssey), her life fading into an ugly trip that will eventually have her chipping away more than a few parts of herself to fit into a mold; her extreme desperation, coming from the slums of life, can only forsee splattering a boldfaced message on that mold, exhausted from the routines she's forced upon herself, and that have been forced upon her.  \n\nIronically, this basis for a story is told amidst a framework antithetical to the consumer demand movie 'the man' would have you molding for, so we get to explore two extreme contrasts told within each other.  We get this indirect sense of Lynch's conspiratorial paranoia when we see 'the man' speaking from the control room, delivering orders from the top of a heirarchy.  We know nothing more of 'who' they are than Lynch himself, other than that we know these rooms and these people exist in some fashion, and they control our lives.\n\nThe film works because it's \"hypnotic\" (as Roger Ebert put it), but it's over-the-top in trying to be clever, and I believe most audiences will just feel too far removed, as even I did for the most part.  There's more than just an impression Lynch is making, and that's where he should've stopped himself, because the structure of the script acts as though it encodes some greater meaning that the audience can't access as much as they would if this structure was ignored.  It would've been more interesting to not loop the structure and return to scenarios from different angles, but rather continue moving forth with the same impressions in a spiral journey. abstract linear form.",

It's the greatest movie of the 21st Century as of right now. i just don't give this one a 5-star because it's too early, but soon it will be one part of the elite. People who think that Nolan brought complexity to the mainstream that's completely wrong, comparing Nolan to Lynch is like comparing Rowlings to Orwell. So I don't understand how come all Nolan's movies are on the top 250 on IMDB. Anyway, Mulholland Dr. is a masterpiece made by a genious who is sure about his rising potential, even with 60 years-old. He is the definition of art: he only does a movie when he finds a perfect idea, and that's why he hasn't made a movie since Inland Empire, he admited the lack of inspiration, that's a real artist, he doesn't make movies just to top box offices. And the result on this one is beyond perfect, I mean, everything about it it's special: the acting is superb; the cinematography is always a strong point on Lynch's career; the script and plot are both one of the greatest of all times. It's confusing, and everytime you see it you got to have a different opinion about it, if you don't the movie will mean nothing to you. The movie adjusts to your state of mind. Of course that there is a lot of nonsense imagery and symbolic objects, but that's part of the fun of watching Lynch, Bunuel, Jodorowski, Maya Deren, Chris Marker and all the surrealists the world has produced. A movie that sooner or later will be on the top 10 of S&S, just wait another 10 or 20 years.",

Most critics seemed to revile the film, which was originally shot as a TV pilot that was never picked up  and was then reshot to make it into a feature. That fact probably accounts for a lot of elements that never seem to go anywhere, like the mysterious \"cowboy\", the dwarf in the curtained room or the very fast appearance by Robert Forester. There's also parts that seem to be done only for style or off beat humor, rather than belonging to the greater whole of the film. However, despite all this, if you simply let the film was over you and take it in as a hallucinatory experience about Hollywood, it's a lot of fun and probably the best thing Lynch has done sine his \"Blue Velvet\" \"Twin Peaks\" days. And it's easy to say it now, but I do remember seeing this in the theater and being impressed with Naomi Watts, who this was her first major film role, and is terrific in the film.",

I didn't even realize it when they were at the play and the guy was saying \"This has all been fake\". And I think that's what makes a great movie. One that makes you feel vulnerable and utterly confused, but somehow satisfied at how you were tricked. The story was really interesting.

            "content": "This isnt a review so much as a theory about the movie. So big time SPOILER ALERT.\n\n\n\nThe Theory:\n\nBetty(Diane) and Rita(Camilla) are dead when the movie starts. They are in some dream like, afterlife that is created, at least mostly created, my Diane's subconscious. Camilla's soul is drawn into this world by her guilt and by the power of Diane's desire. Its possible that, since their deaths, a similar series of events have played out a number of times before. Camilla is basically Diane's prisoner in this dream world.\n\nCamilla's amnesia is probably part of Diane's desire to have Camilla dependent on her and to have power over her identity. The false identities of Betty and Rita are probably in place because Diane kind of hates Diane and Camilla, and wants the two of them to be somewhat different people. Remember the line Betty(Diane) rehearses with Rita(Camilla): \"I hate us both!\"\n\nAt Club Silencio the pair are given a big clue to the true nature of their world. In the club they discover a blue box that fits Camilla's blue key. After leaving the club they rush home to open the box. At this point Diane checks out, she goes back to \"that sleep of death\", she is not ready to face the truth. Camilla opens the box and learns the truth.\n\nAfter the opening of the box we, and probably Camilla as well, see what really happened before Diane and Camilla died. This second part of the movie does not show events in chronological order. What happened, in chronological order, was Diane and Camilla met in Hollywood and began a love affair. Diane fell head over heels in love, but Camilla soon lost interest in a monogamous relationship with Diane. Camilla fell for Adam, the director she was working with. Camilla was probably having sex with one or more women as well because she is seen kissing another woman.\n\nDiane took the break up very badly. She was already emotionally unstable, and that dinner party Camilla dragged her too pushed her over the line. Diane hired a hit man to kill Camilla. After the murder Diane couldnt live with herself. She lost her mind and killed herself.\n\nAfter that I suspect its back to the airport for Diane, where she arrives in Hollywood, and back to Mulholland Drive for Camilla, where she loses her memory, and the scenario starts again. Perhaps these two will have to live out this drama again and again until Diane opens the box and learns the truth.\nI think the old, blue haired woman sitting in the balcony of Club Silencio is a version of Camilla, a version who knows the truth. She sits in the balcony and watches these events play out. Perhaps she has already seen it several times. Im not sure how much of Camilla's behavior in life was due to sadism and how much was due to foolishness. But I do think Camilla's guilt is what makes it possible for Diane to hold her soul prisoner.\n\n\nCharacters and Loose Ends:\n\nI believe characters like the Cowboy, the Castigliani Brothers, and the dwarf represent other worldly forces who are behind the scenes, pulling strings in the dream-afterlife-world. What I dont know is whether they are parts of Diane's subconscious or if they are something else. I cant figure out their nature because I cant figure out what they are trying to accomplish. Are they trying to rescue Camilla from Diane? Are they trying to keep the phantom world running in accord with Diane's desires? Or are they trying to do something else?\n\nI think most or all of the other people in the first part of the movie are phantoms created by Diane's subconscious. One possible exception is Adam. Perhaps he was killed when Camilla was killed. Alternatively, since Diane found him intimidating in life, perhaps the phantom Adam created by her mind is powerful enough to challenge order of her world, at least until the other worldly powers put great pressure on him. Also there were a few other people in the audience at Club Silencio, maybe they are also ghosts living in that phantom Hollywood.",

How's this? \"If that damn dog craps in the courtyard one more time, I'm just gonna bake his little butt for breakfast!\" Sorry, that's not a good quote. Sorry, it's not a good movie. This is gonna be one helluva rant. Now that I've seen it, I can finally add David Lynch and Mulholland Drive to my Bottom 10 directors/movies list...if I had one. This was beyond terrible, in more ways than I can count. I'd rather sit and watch the grass grow. I could prolly write books about how bad this is, just like how I could write books on how good Pulp Fiction is. I honestly don't know where to begin: the beginning, the \"music\", the writing, the acting, the plot, the camera, the length, the fact that I had to stop watching numerous times to gather the strength to get through this Boo Fest, the \"mystery of it all\", the critics and Lynchians adoring it, etc...this is a never-ending list, so I'll just stop here for the sake of time. I will now try to tell you what's wrong with each of these, then I will try my hardest to forget this abysmal excuse for a film. In the beginning, there's random people dancing...why? I bet David Lynch doesn't even know. The so-called \"music\" is not music. It's a lame attempt at dark ambience that comes off as just tones and noise. If you want some good dark ambience, go listen to Reznor's The Social Network. It's my favorite album of 2010, and it also won best original score that year. The writing is rather weak and unthought-provoking (is that a word? Well, it is now), and I'd say about 90% of the acting is over done. I was ashamed to see Naomi Watts failing in this, she's usually pretty decent (if you wanna see her really owning her role, watch the American remake of Funny Games). The plot, err, this one is impossible to do briefly, so I'll combine it with \"the mystery of it all\" and the critics. What the hell was Lynch smoking when he thought up this doozy? It's the most convoluted, nonsensical, incoherent garbage I've ever sat through. The \"most terrifying\" scene is the only one that made me laugh (other than the bouts of bad acting), cuz it's so ridiculous and not terrifying at all. I think I understand why critics and flocks of people love this movie. It's cuz they don't get it. Since it's so mysterious, they just accept that as brilliance instead of what they should accept it as, idiotic. I was worried I would lose brain cells for viewing this film. For whatever reason, the camera almost never stays still, even during simple conversations. You may get dizzy, which is always a plus, right? And the extreme close-ups, uhm, pretty sure only Wayne's World is allowed to do that haha. The movie is nearly 2.5 hours, and I almost never say this, but it was way too long. If you're gonna make a movie long, make it worth it, make it count. Think I had to pause it 4 or 5 times just cuz it was making me so angry. When people call this a neo-noir psychological masterpiece, it makes me want to give up on two of my favorite genres in film. Nothing else to say except UGH.",

And yes, all these points are all very well, but ultimately despite my admiration that the film has motivated viewers imaginations I am still left with how it has made an impression on me. It's not like I'm a film goer who equates the necessity to 'enjoy' a film in the sense that it should be a fun ride like in a fairground, but I do have a fairly important stipulation that a piece of art should have power. And Ultimately I wasn't completely won over by Mulholland Drive, I felt emotionally disconnected from its fetishism of Hollywood and quite bored with the purposefully ambiguous dialogue/plot. That it should transcend such barriers of quality control just because it's considered great art seems a ludicrous approach to film criticism, and thus I can only conclude that I didn't get Mulholland drive, not for the purposes of it being a surreal, satirical or even its confusing narrative but simply because I thought while it was at times interesting film it was defiantly not the masterpiece I had been lead to believe.",

            "content": "What do you, as an audience member, go to the movies for?  That is the question you should be asking yourself before you sit down and watch Mulholland Dr.  A bright-eyed girl with aspirations of being a movie star (Naomi Watts) and a car accident victim afflicted with amnesia (Laura Harring) are on two paths that are about to cross in a twisty story about mystery, dreams and Hollywood.  Now I can totally see how people can get frustrated with this movie, as it isn't for those who are sticklers for the traditional narrative structure.  I can appreciate a film that doesn't give into formula and tries something challenging, and this being my second viewing of Mulholland Dr., I did get more out of it going in knowing where the line between fantasy and reality is drawn (it's the second appearance of the cowboy).  That said, I also do believe a film should be able to stand on its own, without you having to do legwork on your own time to deduce the story at hand.  David Lynch has this way of making you feel unnerved and unsettled, even if you don't have your head fully wrapped around just what is going on.  He makes avant-garde films that are otherworldly, this being a fine example of one, and while some may describe this as being self-indulgent and inaccessible, I didn't have that problem because I viewed the majority of this film as if it were dream vignettes.  This boasts some haunting and positively breathtaking cinematography and a wonderful score to complement your head-trip.  If you're looking to challenge yourself, or just looking for a divergence from the mainstream, this is the film for you.",

The whole thing soon splits into dark symbolism, conflicting alternate realities, and a barrage of seemingly-unrelated subplots that converge in unexpected ways. David Lynch writes and directs Mulholland Drive with his famous eye for experimental sound, cinematography, and story structure.

In one half playing Betty, a star-shining actress full of hope and obvious delight, and in the other Diane, a weary, worn-down broken woman, she plays both perfectly, switching ably between the two with ease, which is very impressive.

I liked it a lot and would place it among his top films like Blue Velvet and Eraserhead and Wild at Heart, all of which it shares the same sort of quirky, surreal, voyeuristic, boundary- breaking style which Lynch has been working on all of his career. I do think it's possible to interpret it as a linear plot, and I read that Lynch said as much was possible although he refuses to fill in the details much the same way that Kubrick was about his films, which he felt spoke for themselves.

It isn't just the fact that this film is \"disjointed\", it's HOW it's disjointed that ranks it among not only the greatest films of the 2000's, but of all time. It isn't just HOW the pieces are placed, it's WHAT the pieces contain! Some of these scenes are just so fulfilling to the atmosphere. \"Mulholland Drive\" creates a whole spectrum of how to structure a film as much as \"Wavelength\" (1967) did. I can't quite but it into words, but this is probably the biggest game changer since \"L'Atalante\" (my favorite film) was restored in the 50's.",

            "content": "David Lynch in Mythic Los Angeles  \r\n\r\nAccording to David Lynch, the ideas which became this movie were based on ideas he'd had for a theoretical third season of [i]Twin Peaks[/i].  Instead of Naomi Watts, we would have had Sherilyn Fenn.  He has not, so far as I know, said if dear Audrey's fate would have been the same as the eventual direction the movie took.  It strikes me as unlikely, given Audrey, but it does explain why a character in the movie is named Diane, I suppose.  It hurts me a little to think of Audrey going through the end of this movie, but hey, at least she'd be out of that exploding bank.  I have put up with a lot of lunacy from David Lynch over the years, though I couldn't quite get through [i]Lost Highway[/i]--maybe I'll try again someday--and I would have followed him through that plotline.  Heck, I'm one of those people who likes about half of [i]Fire Walk With Me[/i].  And I would have liked to have seen where the theoretical TV show this would have become would have gone.\r\n\r\nObviously, there's not much point in trying to explain the plot of this movie.  Because David Lynch.  Broadly, however, we are watching the stories of Betty (Watts) and Rita (Laura Harring).  One night, Rita is in a car being driven to a location on Mulholland Drive.  The driver of the car stops it and is going to shoot her, but a drag-racing car smashes into it.  Everyone else is killed, and Rita--not her real name--stumbles away.  She has amnesia.  She ends up sneaking into the apartment of Betty's Aunt Ruth (Maya Bond), who is off on a trip to Canada.  Betty discovers Rita in her shower.  Betty herself is in town to audition for a movie.  She, like so many others, has dreams of being an actress.  However, she takes in Rita, and that's where everything starts to go wrong.  It's Lynchian going wrong, so it's hard to explain, but across town, there is a director (Justin Theroux) who may tie into this.  He is told by mysterious men that if he doesn't cast a certain girl in his film, he will suffer for it.\r\n\r\nEven the bright, sunny bits with Betty seem like a dream.  Oh, a daydream, to be sure.  Just what every girl from small-town Ontario dreams moving to Los Angeles will be like.  When she goes to her audition, everyone is completely welcoming.  There are people there who have no reason to be other than to see her, personally.  But when Rita enters the dream, it is darker.  Richer.  Erotic in that peculiar way of film noir, where you can't trust the woman but you don't care.  And because Rita cannot remember her past, she brings no baggage to the relationship.  She is all Betty's, whatever that entails.  It just happens that it currently pleases Betty to play Girl Detective.  There are things it is better not to know, but Betty is an innocent, and life hasn't taught her that particular lesson yet.  Of course, even without Rita, it's not likely that Betty would have stayed an innocent long in Hollywood.\r\n\r\nThere were other interweaving bits to the plot, but to explain them would require understanding them, and I'm not at all sure I did.  There's the mysterious cowboy (Monty Montgomery).  The gangsters (Dan Hedaya and Angelo Badalamenti).  Dan (Patrick Fischler) and Herb (Michael Cooke).  I'm not sure David Lynch really needs a reason to include details like that, but let's say that it's to make the whole thing more dreamlike.  David Lynch's work has always struck me as looking into the ground between dream and reality, and this movie is no exception.  I don't think you're supposed to know what's real and what isn't.  I don't think Lynch is necessarily sure himself.  I think he's fond of \"well, that seemed like a neat idea at the time,\" and I don't have much problem with that.  I have no problem with exploring the characters' psychology as part of getting to know the world they live in.  I think that's true more often than not even in the real world, much less in fiction.\r\n\r\nOf especial interest to many of my friends is that the movie does have genuine lesbian eroticism.  Even bisexuality.  And it isn't played for shock value, I don't think, the way Laura Palmer's adventures were.  It just seems like two women clinging to one another for comfort in a strange and confusing world, and I think that's half of what most love is in the first place.  Of course, it turns out to be more complicated than that, but it's David Lynch.  No relationship in all of his work is exactly what it appears on the surface.  And that's also perfectly acceptable to me.  The relationship we see is only half the story in any situation.  Every pairing has secrets.  In this movie, the important thing to remember is that secrets can be dangerous to learn and dangerous to keep.  There are accusations of plagiarism floating around on this one, and I'd certainly say that some of Lynch's influences are more obvious than others.  I haven't seen [i]Persona[/i], so I can't say how much he borrowed from that.  But for all it's a relationship between two women, it's a relationship straight out of noir.",

In my opinion, Mulholland Drive actually makes a great deal more sense than most other films by David Lynch, whose movies are often very abstract and unique. Like most David Lynch films, Mulholland Drive is very difficult to summarize in one brief statement, but if I had to simplify it, I would say it tells the story of an amnesiac woman who meets an aspiring actress named Betty and forms a close bond with her as they both try to discover the woman's identity. That barely scratches the surface of the plot, and the movie is far less straightforward in telling its story than that summary would have you believe. The movie is very much deserving of more than one viewing to fully understand and catch all of the subtle details contained within, and trust me, there are a great number of extremely subtle details. The movie is at times mesmerizing in its strangeness, but it is always thoroughly interesting, even in the most unusual of scenes, such as a scene at a diner early in the movie that should make you feel at least a little creeped out. This really is a deeply original and incredibly intelligent mystery/drama/thriller from the always wonderful David Lynch, and has to be seen to truly be believed. Mulholland Drive is an incredible, haunting film to watch and one that should remain in your memory for a great while as one of the best movies of the 2000s.",

He has done it before in his movies (Lost Highway), but Mulholland Dr. Delivers a really twisty story line that, admittedly, will leave you confused, but entertained with some superb acting, especially by Naomi Watts and Justin Theroux. Mulholland Dr. looks at two lives that clash together. One, a lady on the run in a car crash scared out of her mind looking to hide (Laura Harring). The other is a sweet lady from Deep River, Ontario who is trying to make it big in Hollywood (Naomi Watts). When their lives collide, the audience is taken into a twisted mystery that leads you through the Hollywood and the world of cinema. However, near the end, we get a Lost Highway/mobius-strip type twist which changes these two characters almost completely. At the end you are left wondering what was real and what was illusion. When David Lynch is on, he is absolutely on. He commands some great performances out his actors and actresses in this movie. Naomi Watts is absolutely stellar. It is completely amazing how she turns from a sweet, naive girl from Deep River, Ontario into an obsessed, mildly depraved woman who is love with Laura Harring\u00e2(TM)s character. Laura Harring was great as the mysterious woman who falls into Naomi Watts. Justin Theroux is also hilarious and great in his role as a conflicted director. Lynch also directs some wonderful, surrealistic sequences. The most beautiful of all of them, though, is the pantomime theatre. The illusion of the singing is absolutely breathtaking and gorgeous. It is a real thing to behold and a work of pure art. Mulholland Dr. is another wonderful addition to the David Lynch collection. It has some great acting performances and some of the beautiful scenes any David Lynch film. Non-Lynch fans will be mildly satisfied with the ending but will love the performances. Lynch fans will absolutely love this film.",

            "content": "Mulholland Dr. is a wild ride and it's best to experience it without knowing anything the first time you see it. The plot is non-linear and the ending isn't typical Hollywood fare. Most of my friends hated it and thought it was a waste of their time. But for those who like it, the experience is up there with the best that film has to offer. If you are analytical and curious enough to watch the film two or three times in quick succession, you're the type of person who may end up loving this film. If you haven't seen it and think you fit that description, I hope you will give it a try.\n\nMulholland Dr. is my favorite film of all time. The prospect of seeing the Blu-ray both excited and scared me as I wondered whether the presentation would be worthy of the film.\n\nIt elevated it to a different level.\n\nThe story is full of mystery and unfolds like a detective story for the first two-thirds of the film. Betty (Naomi Watts), an aspiring actress, wins a jitterbug contest and uses it as an opportunity to fly to Los Angeles to seek out an acting career. Immediately after, we see a car crash in which Rita (Laura Harring) suffers amnesia and seeks refuge in Betty's empty home. The two soon meet and Betty tries to help Rita remember who she is.\n\nThe film was intended to be a television series and the first two acts were formed by the aborted pilot. Eventually, new funding allowed Lynch to finish the film and it evolved into an entirely different story. The plot isn't linear, and the distinction between dream and reality becomes increasingly blurred.\n\nThis is a complex puzzle that is very hard to take in on the first viewing and is therefore not for everyone. If you like fast-paced action and straightforward stories wrapped up neatly by the end of the movie, you probably won't appreciate the film. If you enjoy mysteries and being confused and unsettled, it may interest you.\n\nIt changed the way I watch movies.\n\nThis is the kind of film that possesses you. The best way to view it is to let it carry you along and wash over you. Save your analysis for repeat viewings. And if you have an inquisitive mind, there will be many repeat viewings.\n\nI first saw this film without understanding all of it, but I found myself going over it in my mind and watching it again the next day. Then I wanted to tell all my friends about it. Over time, it has surpassed everything I have ever seen. It's full of intrigue and makes me feel so many different emotions. It's quite brilliant and Lynch's best work, although all of his projects are valuable and important.\n\nWatching one of Lynch's films takes you on a journey into a different world. There's something not quite right with the world, but it's hard to identify exactly what it is. But it adds to the feeling of unease. In Mulholland Dr., he uses interesting camera angles to show you a glimpse of what is ahead. As a result, you become part of the story and see it unfold as the main characters do.\n\nThere's a lot going on in this strange world. We are shown several different characters, initially unconnected, with no explanation of their overall role in the story. This probably happened because the threads were meant to be expanded on in the television series. You will meet film directors, detectives, a hit man, and a whole host of minor characters.\n\nThe film is punctuated by moments of bizarre humor. Some of the comedic scenes make me laugh out loud, and that's not an easy thing to achieve. There are also moments of violence and mystery and ultimately true desolation.\n\nThe final act turns everything on its head. Betty and Rita become Diane and Camilla. It's initially confusing, but everything becomes clear when you think about what you have seen and felt. \n\nIt's full of symbols and metaphors and has an underlying theme which examines the Hollywood industry as a whole.\n\nLynch creates a mood better than any director I have ever seen. The colors, settings and actions of the characters all enhance the atmospheric presentation, and Angelo Badalamenti's haunting score completes the experience. Mulholland Dr. has many of the elements that made Twin Peaks my favorite television show of all time. If you like one, you will almost certainly like the other.\n\nI'm not going to expand any further on the plot, such as it is, because it may put you off seeing the film. It's complex, but it's very rewarding when you examine the experience after the fact. It's the kind of film that encourages people to develop their own theories. Lynch refuses to explain it, preferring that you develop your own idea about what it represents.\n\nThe film can be viewed as a series of interesting scenes. In fact, that's probably a good way to view it for the first time. The final act isn't a predictable occurrence. If you're someone that finds that refreshing, like me, then you should check out Mulholland Dr. if you haven't already done so. Several film magazines voted it the best film of the last decade. It's certainly something that can be appreciated even if you have other favorites.",

            "content": "I want to add my two cents about what is currently my big obsession: Mulholland Drive. Bought the dvd maybe a year ago, but only got round to watching it a few days ago. Kinda enthralled. Did some reading. Checked out a few theories. Got a few of my own. I admit that I have changed my ideas, and credit for extricating me from a blind alley or two goes to some of those whose blogs/reviews I've read, whose names evade me, I'm afraid. That said, I'm genuinely shocked that a lot that strikes me as bleedingly obvious (albeit not until I'd watched the dvd half a dozen times or more) hasn't entered the general consciousness of the critical community. So, I'm gonna share my words of wisdom with the rest of you.\r\n\r\nLet me start by saying that prior to Diane Selwyn waking up, everything was a dream, leaving aside the jitterbugging and head moving towards pillow. The dream is indeed Diane's. It is impossible to make sense of the dream until after seeing the rest of the film. I am going to play around with this blog entry. I intend to edit it, add to it, rather than do the right thing, which is craft a final draft then release it into the wild. Don't have the patience for that. Y'all can see it emerge piecemeal from this thing I call a brain.\r\n\r\nWhere should I start? Suppose I tell y'all that the lesbian scene whose tenderness impresses so many of the film's fans is in actual fact a masturbation scene taking place in the head of a schizophrenic killer having a wet dream? In other words, both Betty and Rita are fragments of Diane's shattered consciousness. The Queen has left the building, as Mr Roque more or less pointed out when initiating his telephone chain call. \"The girl is still missing\" refers to Diane, who has surrendered her consciousness. Mr Roque represents an aspect of Diane's psyche, as do all the employees at the film studio, including director, Adam Kesher.\r\n\r\nIn the dream, Adam Kesher fulfills two functions. Most obviously, we witness Diane's attempt to rationalise how her dreams of becoming a movie star and great actress came to nothing. It was not that the director of \"The Silvia North Story\" did not want her for the part, did not recognise her extraordinary talent. She was frustrated because she was collateral damage in a war between the director and his employers on the one hand and a set of gangsters on the other. Ray, his manager (Robert Smith) and the other executive at the meeting with the Castigliani Brothers represent those diplomats who negotiate between the creative aspect of our personalities (represented by the director) and hard, objective realities. The top of the food chain of the latter is represented by The Cowboy. While you can attempt to tell the Castigliani Brothers to piss off, to shatter the windscreen of their limosene with a golf club, to resign to make a point, you don't turn down The Cowboy. Not if you know what's good for you. When he laid down the law, the light went out for Adam. As he surrendered with the words \"This is the girl\", his eyes met Betty's. This was love at first sight. Had Adam not been given an offer he couldn't refuse, and had Betty not cut short her embarrasing, inevitable rejection by going ahead with the ambition, she'd have no excuse for why her ambitions were thwarted. But Diane's subconsciousness has fashioned her alibi. And she feels better for this. From this point on, Betty and Rita are no longer interrupted from their mission of uncovering Rita's identity. They become convinced that she can't be Diane, as her neighbour didn't recognise her. However, the conversation the neighbour has is not one she had with either Rita or Betty. Rather this was one she had with those other two doing detective work, the two she refers to after Diane wakes up.\r\n\r\nWhen they enter Diane's apartment, the stench of death is overpowering. And the corpse causes Rita to despair. She might not know what she has to do with it, yet. But she knows enough to run screaming into the fresh air, having let her inquisitive neighbour depart the scene. Rita and Betty know enough now to realise that Rita needs a new identity, and dying her hair the same colour as Betty's seems not a bad idea. They are now a partnership against the world with a secret. They are comfortable. They are in bed. They are one. This sex scene. I'm afraid this is a masturbation scene. Not so tender when seen that way. For Betty and Rita are both fragments of Diane's shattered personality. When Mr Roque says \"The girl is still missing\" the girl that everyone is searching for is the one who does not answer the phone. It is Diane. When Mr Roque with the words \"then\" and \"and\" informs an underling (I think it is Ray) that the studio was to shut everything down, what was being refered to was the suicide of Diane. The script of the scene that is faxed to Betty, that is the audition between her and her father's best friend, when it is rehersed by Betty and Rita is in actual fact words handed down to them from another part of the subconsciousness. This was an investigation of the pros and cons of suicide.\r\n\r\nWhen Diane masturbated while crying, this was an expression of her having lost the ability to love herself. When Rita and Betty make love, that represents the moment when Diane's subconsciousness has reconciled herself, at least momentarily, with what she has become. But in her dream state, her anxiety ebbs and flows. At 2:00am, part of Diane's shattered ego calls out \"silencio\". She wants to die. She persuades the more innocent version of herself (the old, now renamed copy of an earlier version of Diane's operating system to be booted up when Diane's goes AWOL) to attend Club Silencio. That is where the alternative to living is explained. The beautiful singer can die but her song goes on. Death is not the end, if the memories linger, which they will do so long as they are sweet ones. On that realisation, Betty and Rita are in possession of the box to which they have the key. Things take a new turn...\r\n\r\nFrom entering Club Silencio, they have not spoken a word and are destined never to do so again. From being reduced to tears and startled by the appearance of the box, they appear to be joined at the hip, their movements chorgraphed, marching in step. When they enter Betty's apartment, they act as if one individual with one mind. And when Rita retrieves the hatbox with her purse and the key... Betty has gone. She's fulfilled her role, which was to take Diane's shattered mind on a journey of recovery. Diane had been shattered and put back together so many times. This was the final time. Not having Betty to hold her hand as she opened the box, she does so anyway. The box open and the darkness at it's heart engulfs the world. Then it falls to the floor. There's nothing to hold it up, since this key has opened up the world to the illusory nature of Rita as much as of Betty. The falling of the box to the floor is heard by the woman who vacated the appartment before Rita squatted there, Betty's aunt. But that woman sees no box, nor anything else. The appartment is now deserted by the pair of squatters, who were ghosts, two fragments of Diane's disordered mind. And something else. That Cowboy. The one who made Adam an offer he couldn't refuse. Well, he's back. This symbol of harsh reality is here to inform the pretty girl that it's time to wake up. The pretty girl in question being the one who was still missing, according to Mr Roque. And what was the hard reality that woke her up? Nothing psychic or symbolic. It was the knocking of the door by her neighbour.\r\n\r\nWe learn that the two detectives called to see Diane again. Clearly they've called before. And, as we know from the stench of death Betty and Rita smelt, she's not going to escape the law forever. In her dream, she taught herself just how incompetent her hired hitman is. Whether or not this depiction is accurate, these are her anxieties. And they're not going away any time soon. And there's not a lot of time left. Having gotten rid of her neighbour, the next few hours are left with her brooding and day dreaming and hallucinating. The flashbacks allow us to decode those symbols from her dream we have not been able to so far. Names and faces were collected by Diane's subconsciousness to weave a tapestry to explain what her options are. She can be immortal by living fondly in the memories of... Who? Actually, she's all alone. But what about Irene and her companion? The pair who travelled to Los Angeles with her from Ontario. Actually, they came from further back than that. These are in fact her parents. They reenter his life because, being so small, they can crawl under the door. But when those knocking detectives enter and smell that stench of death, her parents will no longer be her best friends. She will have lost everything. She takes the cowards way out, actually the only rational alternative for her. She blows her brains out. And as the curtain falls for the last time, and silencio... We see her as happy as we saw her with her parents before the opening credits. But who is the other woman? Is that her lover? Is it Camilla? In my opinion, probably not. I do not believe that Diane loved Camilla any more than she was loved by her. There's was a sick relationship from start to finish.\r\n\r\nWhen Rita tells Diane \"I don't know who I am\", they open her purse and find inside this symbol of female genetalia $125,000 on top of a blue key, a phallic symbol. Blue being symbolic of sex work. In my opinion, Diane was never more than a sex slave for Camilla, to be abused and humiliated. Possibly slave is not the right word. After all, Diane was selling her body. What price did she ask? She lived vicariously Camilla's film stardom. Camilla stole from her her dream. Not being able to live the life herself, she settled for attaching herself to the one who got it, and who got in undeservedly, according to her subconsciousness. We know from the story she told Camilla's soon-to-be mother in law (Coco), that Diane's never gotten over this. What is more, we learn why Camilla \"This is the girl\" Rhodes has a different face in her dream. Not satisfied with publicly humiliating Diane with her heterosexual lover (Adam), Camilla goes to great trouble to teach Diane that her role of lesbian lover has been usurped by another. \"This is the girl\" and it ain't you, sunshine.\r\n\r\nAs her replacement as lesbian sex slave moves out of the picture, in walks The Cowboy. One of the Castigliani brothers is seen staring menacingly at her. Both are merely memorable images her subconsciousness will use as raw material in her dream. The waitress's nametag \"Betty\" is something else that will come in useful, as will the blue key. Why did the hitman think is so funny to be asked \"What does it open?\" There's no definitive answer from the material. However, it's plausible to explain this away in his head as hilarity at her failure to appreciate that the sole purpose of this blue key is to act as a message, to let her know that the job's complete. But that's not how she interprets it. For her, as for the director (for Lynch), there's a symbolic meaning. It represents a nightmare. And Lynch takes us on a short detour which her subconsciousness is already fashioning for her. The alternative to the beautiful immortality of the dead singer is the living hell of the monster living alone and scaring normal people to death. That's her life if she doesn't take it. The face of the man at the counter is simply one more part the raw material from which her hyper-sensitive subconsciousness is preparing her dream. In the dream he says he's had this dream not once but twice before. Maybe the film is of a dream that Diane's had more than once. Possibly not. Anyway, this is most of what I've worked out over the last few days. Anyone care to pull these theories to shreds? I'd appreciate serious comments.",

Don't bother asking questions; you'll get no answers. Lynch never feels the need to bother us with an explanation. He makes it our job to determine what happened, and that task borders on the impossible. The \"twist\" ending that Lynch supplies us with is a hasty and hackneyed maneuver -- a final and desperate attempt to tie everything together. The result is a chaotic and disorganized mess that many people mistake for \"brilliance\", which it is not. There is no logic at all involved.

Though one could spend a lifetime trying to make sense of it all, I think the great Roger Ebert had it right when compared the film to a dream. The whole thing isn't a story, it's an experience. Lynch plays with his audience here, creeps us out, turns us on, draws us into a mystery that cannot be solved. As with many movies, my first viewing turned out to be unsatisfactory. Not because the film was bad, only because I kept waiting for an explanation to the whole thing. Now, going back, like to a dream once had, I was able to absorb the film like a sponge. One scene that stands out in particular is the diner scene. Never before have I ever been so scared of an image on a screen. The Exorcist is a terrifying film, but I've watched it a hundred times, and the visceral power it held over me is long gone. When I saw the figure emerge from behind the diner however, I felt my heart sink within my chest. There is little sound in the shot, no screams or clangs or clashes, no violins, only a soft organic whooshing, like the flesh of a corpse, reanimating. I've watched this diner scene as many, if not more, times than I've seen The Exorcist, and it gets to me every time. If I digress, it is only to show how well Lynch directs here. Returning to the main focus, Mulholland Drive is a great film, and anyone with an open mind hoping for a truly unique and satisfying movie-going experience will find it here.",

            "content": "I never, ever thought I would say this, but I watched this notoriously incomprehensible film again 10 years after the first time I saw it, and by God, it actually makes sense! And not just in some vague thematic way; when you see it the second time, you realize there's actually a perfectly sensible plot explanation for almost everything that happens in the movie. I don't want to explain it lest I spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it (or have only seen it once), but suffice to say my mind was blown by how much more sense it made this time.\n\nThe movie opens in a rather Twin-Peaks-y way with a chipper young actress named Betty (Naomi Watts) landing in Los Angeles for the first time to stay at her absent aunt's apartment. She meets a woman who is suffering from amnesia after a car accident, and together they try to solve the mystery of who she is. There's also a hip young movie director played by Justin Theroux who plays a key part. And that's all I have to say about the plot.\n\nNaomi Watts gives an extraordinary performance (or group of performances, actually - you'll see) as Betty.  The role requires her to play in a lot of different registers, not just emotionally, but as if she were on different levels of reality at different points in the movie, and she pulls it off beautifully. Again, you might not pick up on how good her performance is until a second viewing. Laura Harring is also really excellent as the amnesiac woman. Theroux's part is a little bit dryer, but he's funny and likable in his own way here. \n\nI have to give full credit to David Lynch for making this movie as incredible as it is. You can put this alongside Blue Velvet and Twin Peaks as his absolute best work, and all three are really fantastic. There are still Lynch movies I don't like, but when he's really at the top of his game, he's a truly amazing filmmaker. It does take a second viewing to appreciate all the little clues and layers of reality Lynch is putting in front of you; you'll more than likely miss most of it the first time. But even if you don't like the movie the first time you see it, wait a while, then go back to it, and you'll be amazed by it. Obviously there are certain things in the plot that can't be literal (Club Silencio, for example), but just about everything here can in fact be explained either in terms of plot or of the characters' psychology. I feel like I've reached some new plane of mental capacity today. I feel like the guy seeing Jupiter in 2001: A Space Odyssey when he says, \"My God, it's full of stars!\", except I'm saying, \"My God, Mulholland Drive really does work!\"",

The music is always so eerie, the suspense is too much to handle; there better not be anything popping out on screen or I'm gonna get a heart attack. Billy Ray Cyrus is in this? Who is this cowboy? This guy is speaking in such profound sentences, what does it mean? Everything is so mysterious, what is this leading to?!! [Then] Whoa, Whoa, oh. WHOA, WHAT?! Holy cr-what the h-isn't she her and isn't she h-what on earth?! I bet everything is going to come together in the end... [Silencio.]\"\n\nEverything was so mysterious. There is obviously lots going on in the last bit. I had no idea what happened (though there was no trouble following the first two thirds of the film), and still had no idea after watching it. Only after reading some articles did the general gist of it seem clear. Note that this film is open-ended and is up for lots of interpretations. And there are probably lots of cryptic messages and symbolism in this too. I honestly can't be bothered going too deeply into it.

He has done it before in his movies (Lost Highway), but Mulholland Dr. Delivers a really twisty story line that, admittedly, will leave you confused, but entertained with some superb acting, especially by Naomi Watts and Justin Theroux. \n\nMulholland Dr. looks at two lives that clash together. One, a lady on the run in a car crash scared out of her mind looking to hide (Laura Harring). The other is a sweet lady from Deep River, Ontario who is trying to make it big in Hollywood (Naomi Watts). When their lives collide, the audience is taken into a twisted mystery that leads you through the Hollywood and the world of cinema. However, near the end, we get a Lost Highway/mobius-strip type twist which changes these two characters almost completely. At the end you are left wondering what was real and what was illusion.\n\nWhen David Lynch is on, he is absolutely on. He commands some great performances out his actors and actresses in this movie. Naomi Watts is absolutely stellar. It is completely amazing how she turns from a sweet, naive girl from Deep River, Ontario into an obsessed, mildly depraved woman who is love with Laura Harring\u00e2(TM)s character. Laura Harring was great as the mysterious woman who falls into Naomi Watts. Justin Theroux is also hilarious and great in his role as a conflicted director. \n\nLynch also directs some wonderful, surrealistic sequences. The most beautiful of all of them, though, is the pantomime theatre. The illusion of the singing is absolutely breathtaking and gorgeous. It is a real thing to behold and a work of pure art.\n\nMulholland Dr. is another wonderful addition to the David Lynch collection. It has some great acting performances and some of the beautiful scenes any David Lynch film. Non-Lynch fans will be mildly satisfied with ending but will love the performances. Lynch fans will absolutely love this film.",

Twin Peaks scares the shit out of me too.",

It incorporates every genre into one film.

The soundtrack is ideal for this film. The story, performances, editing... everything is just dead-on.

            "content": "Mulholland Drive is incredible. I'm very partial to Eraserhead and Blue Velvet, but this just might be Lynch's best. Dream sequences are very often portrayed on film, but they never really feel like dreams. Inception is a good example. It portrays the most concrete way of thinking about dreams, without actually creating the right atmosphere. It feels real, then crazy shit happens, you realize you're dreaming, that's it. I've never had a lucid dream, so I can't honestly say that it wouldn't be like how it's shown in Inception, but I'm pretty sure it wouldn't feel like an action movie. Mulholland Drive, on the other hand, creates the feel of dreaming so brilliantly that even thinking about it now feels like thinking about a dream. I've had dreams (more specifically nightmares) that exist in the same terrifying environment as Mulholland Drive. There's a scene where two people are talking in a restaurant about dreams and they go outside and this face pops out. That's one of the most startling and scary things I've ever seen. I freeze framed the face that pops out. It's really not that scary, it's not like the girl from the Exorcist, but it felt so real that I had to pause the movie and walk around for half an hour in a state of dread. It felt like a nightmare. It's weird, and thinking back on it, it shouldn't have been as scary as it was, but that's why it's so brilliant. One of my scariest dreams literally looked like a shitty Atari game. There were two dimensional zombies in it. It was the context, the fact that at the time it felt real, that made it so scary. Just for that scene alone, the movie should be given some sort of honor or award, but as it goes on it gets even better. Mulholland Drive makes a fantastic parallel between the version of the word \"dream\" that means the thoughts and whatnot that go on when you sleep and the version of the word used to describe ambitions or passions or goals. It's terrifying, clever, brilliant, extremely well acted (Naomi Watts is amazing), and an all around amazing movie that should be considered revolutionary in the way it creates the atmosphere of dreams on film.",

Some people are going to be irritated at the strangeness of this film, but others like me enjoy that strangeness and it serves to draw us into the mystery.\r\n\r\nThere is fantastic use of music throughout the film - extremely confusing, notably accompanied by groups of people outside the cinema scratching their heads and discussing the plot furiously. Basic summary (I think!): The film is a comment on Hollywood; good is turned to bad, light to dark, helpless to manipulative, and innocent to evil because of the corruption surrounding the industry, and the depseration and insecurity brought in by \"wannabe\" film-stars. The film actually starts in the middle of the story, the story ends in the middle of the film, then the end of the film goes right back to the start of the story, get that?!? Story appears to be: nice innocent girl becomes lesbian after meeting amnesia-suffering vulnerable woman, but this turns out to be a concussion fuelled dream by the amnesiac who is the reason the nice-girl slides down into a moral oblivion becoming a hit-man ordering protitute after she has lost numerous parts in films to said amnesiac (who also used to be her girlfriend), thus shattering original plot and making for some excellent contrasts at the end of the film. Plenty of Lynch-ness thrown in throughout to confuse - similarities so close within each sub-plot they seem to make it one story, but it isn't - e.g. in the dream the girls visit no. 12 and are re-directed to no. 17, then a similar situation in the real-life ending where the new occupant of no. 12 tells the occupant of no.17 she has had visitors, there are completely different visits but viewers automatically link the two, thus confusing even further the chronology of the film etc. etc! Great - a must see, at least three times to get to grips with it!!!\r\n\r\n\"Mulholland Drive\" features great performances from both female actors, especially Watts and I can't understand why she wasn't nominated for Academy Award!\r\n\r\nOh and Attention BOYS!!! Film contains lesbian sex scenes... you're still here?! Go watch it :)",

I went to art school and have traveled the world to see innovative works. This movie although I believe is closer to what happens when an \"artist\" is given too much respect and freedom in his creation. There are so many portions that seem unrelated to the story and way too many areas that feel like a Director just enjoying his power over young actresses. I see glimpses of creative genius buried in a mire of Hollywood crap. The first half of the film kept reminding me of bad Scinemax movies. If it is supposed to be poor Diane's fantasy this woman is seriously lacking in realistic situations or characters. It was borderline campy and ridiculous. Unless she was on drugs or skitzo the glue that holds a movie together or even a whacky dreamscape was completely missing. \n\nCompare it to the escapism fantasy situations in Pink Floyd the Wall movie. At least here... even with limited insight a viewer can understand it is an ongoing psycho-suffering of a young man in pain from his rock star lifestyle, drug use and cheating wife. \n\nIn Mullholland drive you are never aloud to KNOW what the situation really is. I call this situation \"The King has no clothes.\"\nJust because a respected director known for symbolism and confusing plots, turns out a \"movie\" that was pieced together from something meant for a TV series, doesn't make it good or art.\n\nI did enjoy moments. What can I say, I am a man. and the touching sex scenes did come off slightly believable for brief seconds. Nami's performance with this mess deserves some prase.

It's difficult to see where reality starts and where the dream ends which makes this really interesting to watch. The idea that making it big in hollywood is determined by connections rather than talent and the portrait of failed actresses working as waitresses across Hollywood's cafes, may ring true. Hard to say but that appears to be the tenet of the film. The opera singing scene emphasises the sad misfortune of Naomi Watts dilema. Also, great lesbian scenes, Naomi Watts is hot and talented.

A film made out of a series of occurences and pictures that might or might not seem to have any purpose or meaning.\n\nLynch does not intend to tell a story, nor to entertain or terrify (even though he would be capable of doing all these things at the same time, i believe). He wants you to fill in the blanks and make it complete for yourself. Whether the film has a meaning or otherwise, you make that meaning yourself. That is the magic of Lynch!",

            "content": "FULL REVIEW!\r\nA host of bizarre and shady characters get up to weird and sinister goings-on in and around Hollywood in this frustratingly confusing thriller straight from the twisted imagination of director David Lynch. \r\n\r\nI must admit that I'm not overly familiar with Lynch's work to date. I've only really ever seen part of his bizarre cult TV show \"Twin Peaks\". I sadly didn't get all the way through it though; I was put off by its meandering plot and random characters. It was with some apprehension then that I came to watch Mulholland Drive, often quoted as being Lynch's best work for 15 years by top critics. I was expecting it to be very similar to Twin Peaks; full of weird and wonderful personalities with apparently no need to be in the story at all and a plot that was both random and confusing. My assumptions were right in many respects, although what I didn't expect was how much I actually enjoyed it. The film format works a lot better for Lynch then his creation been broken up into episodes, although even though it's only two and a half hours long I was thrown out at the end of the film frustrated and bewildered as to what it all meant. \r\n\r\nI tend not to describe the plot of films in my reviews (you can get a plot from anywhere), but with Mulholland Drive this would have been impossible. In what I'm guessing is Lynch's typical style the story is convoluted, twisting and contradictory. There's characters that don't appear to have any role at all (like the midget in the dark room, the crazy fortune teller lady and the burnt vagrant), and many of the characters change personalities and indeed roles half way through the film. The plot is so weird that I was left feeling annoyed and like I'd wasted my time after the film ended. I argued with my wife afterwards for an hour and a half about what had just happened and it resulted in neither of us being able to conclude or explain what we had just seen. I prefer to wait until all the clues have been given and then to have that eureka moment when it all comes together. But I found Mulholland Drive to be ever changing, and every time you think you've worked out what is going on the film changes the rules and you are left with gaping holes in your original theory. The copy of the DVD we watched also had a sheet containing \"Lynch's 10 clues to unlocking this thriller\", and I have to admit that watching the film with this list in hand made absolutely no difference when trying to penetrate the warping plot. \r\n\r\nFrom what I can understand after two views and researching the film on the internet I'm not the only one who doesn't really get it. At first I thought that the two main female characters were one and the same person, like two seperate aspects of a personality; one light and one dark. As the film progressed the two halves came closer to being the same (symbolised I felt by Rita even changing her hair and appearence to be more like Betty's), until the visit to the mysterious Club Silencio where the two personalities are changed forever and the lighter side is utterly destroyed with the discovery of that ominous Blue Box. I later changed my mind to the idea that the film was split into two halves; one half been \"real\" whilst the other half actually being a wishful dream of one of the characters (seperated once again by the visit to Club Silencio). However, I also suspect that Lynch made this film to be almost like a dream within a dream and the more I try to cement one of my ideas the more bits come off and spoil my theory. Either half of the film could be the dream half (although I suspect the later half is the reality myself), although knowing what I do of Lynch this could be the other way around or maybe even both halves are dreams, maybe dreams of the same person, maybe of two different people! It's clear from reading others' insane ramblings over this film that nobody really knows the truth, and I suspect Lynch is probably very proud of this fact. \r\n\r\nRegardless of the endless theories spun by people trying to understand the film it definately holds a terrible power over you. It's dreamlike and nightmarish all at the same time. I'm sure there is some symbolism of good and evil as well as some symbolic references to the shadows and hopes of human nature. Maybe I'm just reading too much into it (maybe not)!? Its impenetrable plot is very well shot, acted and directed. There is a classy feel throughout despite some harrowing scenes and a steamy lesbian sex-session (which Lynch may have added after seeing a very similar sex scene in rip-off porn flick \"Twin Peeks\"). The acting is incredibly well performed and the cast was evidently picked with care and attention. \r\n\r\nMy only major complaint as stated already is the frustratingly confusing story, which may spoil if for many other viewers too (my wife being one of them). I can see the good film that this is, it's just hidden under the mental weight of it's own weirdness. \r\n\r\nTHE VERDICT? \r\nMulholland Drive is one of those films where the level of your own understanding will determine how much you get out of watching it. It's bizarre and perplexing, but also classy and well made. I guess watching it is the only way to find out for sure if you will like it or not! \r\n\r\nLIKED THIS? \r\nYOU MIGHT LIKE... \r\n\r\nTWIN PEAKS- Lynch's equally cerebral (but much slower paced) TV series about a cop investigating a murdered prom queen in a place where everything and everyone is a little bit strange. It's got Lynch's personality all over it!",

You're not going to enjoy \"Mulholland\" if you just finished enjoying a sip of tea while watching \"The English Patient.\"  In other words, lose the stuffiness, and get ready to suspend your disbelief in a big, fat way.  \r\n\r\nStep 3: Kick everyone else out of the house.  That's right.  \"Mulholland Drive\" is best watched alone.  This is because when you watch films with other people, especially controversial and unusual ones like this bad boy, there's a natural tendency to subconsciously criticize or doubt your own judgements.  So lose the buddy/girlfriend/boyfriend/parent and butter some popcorn on a lonely night.  Trust me, it works better this way.\r\n\r\nNow you're prepared.  So, what's the big deal? you ask.  I've seen lots of bizarre movies, I'm ready for anything! you say.  Well, take it from me.  As someone who has spent, shall we say, an unusually large portion of my young life and young income on watching films, and has probably seen hundreds more movies than the next guy, \"Mulholland Drive\" is a unique experience that requires a certain mindset.  And although some have said it benefits from a 2nd viewing, after seeing it for a 2nd time myself, I'm not sure this is true.\r\n\r\nWhy the extra precautions?  First off, there's not really a plot in Mulholland Drive.  Sometimes the film will suddenly switch gears to a strange place we've never seen before, mostly because it's a cool-looking place.  Characters will say things in conversation that don't add up.  A couple of characters here and there drop dead suddenly for little reason.  In the last portion of the film, there's a role reversal; suddenly one character becomes the other, without explanation.  Also, the entire world, or at least Los Angeles, seems to be controlled by a sick little man sitting in a chair about twenty feet from a microphone.  Oh, and don't forget the probably pointless lesbian sex, the cowboy who speaks like he's the grim reaper, and the (spoiler!) monster who may or may not live behind a diner's trash bin.  \r\n\r\nYep, that about sums up \"Mulholland Drive.\"  Any questions?\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I enjoyed this movie the first time because I took the above precautions and of course, it surprised and haunted me, for which I gave it props.  The individual scenes are undoubtedly fresh and intriguing, which is what makes it great.  Its inventiveness alone is enough reason to appreciate it.  Most people either love or hate \"Mulholland Drive,\" and I used to be one of the former.  But after watching it again, I realized that it might be a little pretentious and tiresome, so for now I'm taking more of a middle-road.  \r\n\r\nGo see \"Mulholland\" because you have to.  It's already an icon in film history.  To boot, David Lynch was nominated for best director for this film, which I believe was justified simply because of its newness.  If you look very closely, the film might be cohesive on a wafer-thin level, something to do with dreamscapes and alternate realities and... stuff.  But critics worldwide agree: \"Mulholland Drive\" doesn't make any damn sense.  You don't watch it to see how it ends.  You watch it for the strange, jarring journey.",

            "content": "I've seen this film so many times it feels like a familiar piece of music to me even after a hiatus of several years.  I watched it again last night and enjoyed it as much, if not more, than I did initially.  Which was very much.  The film essentially works as a piece of music does, in a visceral and direct way, not according to the logic and rules of a screenwriting workshop or film school class.  The film cannot be appreciated easily by trying to force it into that box.  It never intends to explain itself or have an ulterior motive, I feel.  To focus on unexplained and unexplainable events and moments and to feel them without thinking is the best approach to appreciating this film.  There is no story in the conventional sense.  This feels refreshing to me because almost every story these days in a movie is ultimately boring.  I feel like I've seen every story before and I don't care about any director or writers special message, and don't need meaning and profundity shoved down my throat anymore.  I've seen too many movies and I just want an experience to hit me on a gut level.  That's the only unique and challenging thing these days.  This film, to me, gives the audience enough credit to allow them, by suggesting but not dictating, allusions to and suggestions of possible stories not carried out, that then become the seed of dreams, each one unique, in the mind of each viewer afterwards.  Unlike most \"mystery\" films, the \"mystery\" actually deepens, rather than cheapens, with subsequent viewings.  Everyone knows that the mystery is the interesting part, not the solution.  By creating a beautiful mystery and choosing to stay right at the razor's edge of curiosity and unknowing, Lynch creates a timeless thing that means something different to everyone.  Each person imagines different things because so much room is left by lack of explaining, both while watching and after viewing this movie, which makes it like an infinite number of movies in one, if a movie is the person's experience of it and not what's tangibly on screen for the duration.  A great and important film, much like almost anything Lynch has ever done.",

The film is simultaneously beautiful, terrifying, convoluted, and unique.\n\nFor the majority of the narrative, the viewer has absolutely no idea what is going on.  That's the beauty of it.  Anything could be in store in the next scene - new characters get introduced with little or no explanation and increasingly strange happenings unfold.\n\nThe camerawork in Mulholland Drive proves to be almost as interesting as the occurrences in the film.  Rather than maintaining a static camera, Lynch often allows the camera to subtly \"drift\" up and down while characters are interacting (perhaps most notably during the first Winkie's Diner scene preceding a rather horrifying encounter).  The narrative is anything but ordinary, and so, too, is the camerawork.  \n\nAs the title suggests, most of the subsequent action in the film stems from an encounter at \"Mulholland Drive.\"  However, the pivotal moment for the viewer comes at Club Silencio when we learn that \"No hay banda! There is no band. It is all an illusion!\"  Everything preceding this moment begins to unravel, and the viewer is left to pick up the narrative pieces.  Lynch doubles back on the majority of the film and adds new meaning to the strangeness and creepiness that the viewer has gone through.\n\nMulholland Drive is a demanding, intricately crafted film that exposes the dirty underbelly behind the Hollywood glitz and glamour.\n\n\"Silencio.\"",

This is a little bit easier to follow and understand then Lost Highway.  The acting is very solid and was the start of Naomi Watt's career and she has always been one of my favorite actresses.  David Lynch again proves he is smarter then most people with these script and his direction is top-notch.

Now the two must uncover who the woman really is. There is much more to the plot, but I feel if say anymore I may ruin it.\nAs with all of Lynch's films, this is a piece of weird art but I didn't find it as confusing as Eraserhead. I've heard that a lot of people didn't get this movie and had to look on the internet for the explanation, but about twenty minutes before it was over the answer hit me like a brick and everything started to make sense after that. To be honest I really expected it to be much more complex, but the answer is right in front of you the entire time, you just have to look. The entire movie has a weird dream like atmosphere to it and just like Lynch's other films, all of the characters have something odd about them. I was surprised to see Naomi Watts in this. She plays someone who is completely different from the characters she normally plays and as usual she does fantastic. It was also pretty funny to see Billy Ray Cyrus in this. If you are a fan of Lynch, you should have already seen this and if you aren't afraid to let your mind go, this is excellent. Total Score: 8.3/10",
