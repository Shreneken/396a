    "summary": "Once upon a time, in a far away swamp, there lived an ogre named Shrek (Mike Myers) whose precious solitude is suddenly shattered by an invasion of annoying fairy tale characters. They were all banished from their kingdom by the evil Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow). Determined to save their home -- not to mention his -- Shrek cuts a deal with Farquaad and sets out to rescue Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) to be Farquaad's bride. Rescuing the Princess may be small compared to her deep, dark secret.",

But the overall package just doesn't come together and present that magic reaction you would hope for when adding all those elements together. Don't get me wrong, I love this movie. It's far from being bad, I've seen it tons of times, and I'll probably watch it a few more as well. But it's just not one that I want to watch over and over. 7.75/10",

This movie is WAY underrated in my opinion. In fact, when you actually dig a little further into all the symbolism, lore and subtleties behind it, I think it's kind of brilliant! Especially if you're familiar with Dante's Inferno. Definitely recommend you ignore the Critics score on this one - if you're looking for something that combines mystery and adventure with creepy suspense and a fear of small spaces, this one's a gem!",

The cartoon is based on William Steig's work \"Shrek!\".\n\nThe plot is both gripping and touching. An ogre named Shrek lives in a house in a swamp. Because of a conflict with Lord Farquaad, his house is taken away. At the same time Shrek rescues a talking donkey, which was about to be sold at the market of magical animals. Shrek and Donkey have to go to the dragon's tower to rescue the beautiful princess Farquaad secretly hopes to marry.  Normally when it comes to fairy-tale stories, like a prince rescuing a princess, in this version, Shrek the ogre  rescues a princess.\n\nShrek is great, his sarcasm makes you laugh to death.Donkey is an incredibly hilarious character, for which you could rewatch this film hundreds of times. Princess Fiona is powerful and independent, and she breaks every princess canon.\n\nAt the end, I'd like to say that the script is original, and the catchy soundtrack is also worth noting. You can' t beat unwinding while watching Shrek and having a good laugh.",

Besides, I don't know why, but Shrek always reminded me of my dad. He has the same charisma, similar jokes, offensive, but at the same time funny.\nAnd just recently, at the age of 18, I reviewed all the parts of Shrek, and realized that this isn't a simple children's cartoon with jokes that only adults understand, but also a cartoon with a deep subtext. For all 4 parts, you can see how the evil green giant turned into a kind, cheerful friend, husband and father. Having met his love, Fiona, he changed. In each following part, he did everything to make Fiona happy.\nThis is a wonderful cartoon to watch with the whole family.",

Shrek is a comedy for the whole family, adults will be able to laugh with secret jokes, and children with everyone else. Storyline is fast and dynamic. There are also a lot of cool songs in the cartoon, from rock to pop. Shrek still looks very modern and relevant, I recommend everyone to watch this cartoon",

While about eight thousand films tried to replicate it in the years to come of the early aughts which may have created cynicism and reactionary fatigue directed toward the Shrek franchise as a whole, it cannot be overstated how revolutionary of a product the original Shrek movie was. Revisiting it some 20 years later, the first two thirds are a hilarious and scathing parody of the Disney animated films of the '90s. I applaud Dreamworks for creating such a well-crafted parody that I understood perfectly as an adult (how did anyone hear the name \"Lord Farquaad\" and think this was a film for kids?).\n\nThat being said-even if you don't understand the historical context it was released in and have intimate knowledge of the films it parodies-Shrek is a compelling narrative in its own right. While I do think in the last third of the film it sort of becomes the kind of film it seeks to parody, there is no denying the movie created a compelling set of characters and emotional beats able to stand toe-to-toe with the best of Disney. I don't really love gross out humor all that much (never loved it as a kid, either), but Shrek is a fun movie. Solid 7/10 for me.",
