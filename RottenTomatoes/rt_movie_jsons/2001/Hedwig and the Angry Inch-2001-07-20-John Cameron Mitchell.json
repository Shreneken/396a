    "summary": "A German emigrant living in a trailer in Kansas is the victim of a botched sex-change operation. Adapted from the critically acclaimed off-Broadway rock theater hit, \"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\" tells the story of the \"internationally ignored\" rock singer, Hedwig, and her search for stardom and love.",

            "content": "Hedwig's character is very captivating and Mitchell is great at bringing her to life, while the songs, which play a crucial role, are really good. The film oozes energy, oomph, angst, defiance and wit and yet at its core is a poignant, vulnerable tale of self-discovery. Narratively it's inventive, but that results in occasionally jarring transitions. Its Achilles' heel, however, is the inadequate resolution of the conflicts between the characters: simply breaking into song doesn't really cut it.",

While John Cameron Mitchell is a fierce performer, a musician's chops he hasn't got. So, this film, although true to the originator, is better seen in live theatre where it originated, where the musical numbers feel at their raw, dive-y best.\n\nOne note that this film/live production will have to address is Hedwig and her relationship with an underage boy. While it is an honest look at how things like that happen, and Hedwig is a loveable character, it still is hard to stomach an underage love affair in this woke age and have it be so accepted in song. But, I don't know how you rework a musical which is based in complicated, manipulative relationships? Hedwig only comes to America because she's fulfilling a lie for someone else, and has to come to terms with herself in the process. Can we hold Hedwig responsible if Hedwig is broken too? Ultimately it's something for the next generation to decide.",

Based on a wave-making musical play of the same title, also featuring John Cameron Mitchell in the lead role and created by Mitchell and composer Stephen Trask, it's also the name of the band.  The movie follows the group as they tour the U.S. in the shadow of a rock superstar called Tommy Gnosis (Michael Pitt, playing the would-be Marilyn Manson as rightly slippery, fraudulent, and pathetic) who is currently burning up the charts with Hedwig's songs, credited solely to him.  \n\nJohn Cameron Mitchell and company transcended a hill that, at the time, very few even realized was a hill at all.  The hill might've been a strange and unidentifiable mound of flesh only one inch high, but cross it we must, if empathy is to triumph over hatred, selfishness and division.  A botched sex change makes for strange terrain but work with it (in a very broader sense) we must.  We move may only move six inches forward and five inches back, but in eighteen years, the angry inch gained is progress.  For us, it's an origin of love, if not the origin of love.",

He wasn't even nominated (although the generally clueless Golden Globes did, go figure).  It's one part Spinal Tap, one part Sex Pistols, and all things queer and wonderful.  Adapted from the stage, Mitchell reprises his role as Hedwig, a performer with a past to match his flamboyant present.  As both writer, director and star, Mitchell is the creative heart, and boy does he shine.  The loose narrative teeters at times, and fails to stick the landing.  But with a performance like this, I was happy to take every inch. ",

At best, perhaps, rather than simply repudiate gender tout court, aiming for some impossibly neutral middle ground, a gender equilibrium that still reinforces a basic binary while seeking the stasis of the death drive, one must abandon such dichotomies whatsoever to instead see gender as a fluid spectrum with multiple overlapping identity positions. Such is the case for Hedwig, a character whose radical queerness must have been bracing when she first appeared on stage, whose success and longevity helped spark a transformation in queer acceptance that, twenty years later, makes her problematic aspects all the more glaring, reflecting transphobic myths of child abuse and castration anxiety. Still, the film, for good reason, is iconic, innovative, and subversive, blending cinematic and musical genres just as artfully as Hedwig blends gender.",

            "content": "Though I'm not a big fan of musical cinema, I'm always open to guilty pleasures and Hedwig and the Angry Inch sounded exactly like that.\n\nIn all honesty, my favourite musical film is The Rocky Horror Picture Show due to the over the top nature of its flamboyance and the fact that it just broke convention so much. Hedwig and the Angry Inch similarly deals with transgender related subject matter without sucking up to cliches of the musical genre. \nUnlike Rock of Ages, Hedwig and the Angry Inch is an actual rock musical. The songs in the film actually maintain rock spirit without having to force it into commercial territory as a means of achieving that or playing songs which are little more than novelty. Hedwig and the Angry Inch is an interesting musical because it tells its story through music without it being at the expense of dialogue, and yet at the same time it works as an effective character study for the titular character. The main focus of the film is on the titular protagonist as she tells her life story through music and flashbacks, as well as conveying all of her feelings. This never feels melodramatic, it feels touching and also spirited with all the energy of the songs. Frankly, Hedwig and the Angry Inch knows how to succeed as an effective narrative feature and a good musical at the same time, disregarding all the conventions put out by Hollywood cinema and taking a new path which proves successful. The musical and narrative structure of the film may not always be effectively balanced which can throw viewers off due to a sense of inconsistency, but those who are able to sit back and embrace the over the top nature of many elements in Hedwig and the Angry Inch should approve of it. For me, I got thrown off by this quite a bit as well as the fact that I was so interested in the film that I wanted a lot more from it, setting my expectations a bit high. The fact that some of the subject matter is simplified is important because it reminds us that transgender people are everyday people just like you and me, but I also felt like there was much more of a story to be told. The titular character Hedwig was such an intruiging character who has been through so much, and I guess the fact that the film really wanted to explore it all on location made me think that the scale of Hedwig and the Angry Inch would be larger than it actually was. If it were a stage production then it would be easier to embrace, but because it is a film I felt that it did not maintain enough narrative to precisely constitute a cinematic experience as a whole. But still, the general spirit of it all is there and John Cameron Mitchell has the best intentions at heart.\nFrankly, Hedwig and the Angry Inch is a groovy film. It may not be perfect, but its stylish glamour combined with its legitimate drama and complicated themes make it an effective medium for viewers to learn about transgender identity and love while sitting back and embracing the wonderful music of it all. It is clearly a very personal piece for John Cameron Mitchell and essentially his Citizen Kane due to the fact that he serves as the writer, director and star of the film. We have him to thank for everything in Hedwig and the Angry Inch, and his passionate spirit is wonderful in how it brings the story to life on screen. The main problem I have with Hedwig and the Angry Inch is that I wanted more, and that the short running time of the film was not enough to fully explore the concept as well as it should have been. But either way, Hedwig and the Angry Inch remains an effectively entertaining feature which stands out as a well crafted film and an effective directorial debut from John Cameron Mitchell.\nAlso, there is no denying the sense of style in Hedwig and the Angry Inch. With the scenery so accurately conveying a sense of various settings throughout the film but a production design which remains simple, Hedwig and the Angry Inch is a colourful film. The cinematography evokes the feel of a documentary at many times which adds to the dramatic effect of the intended legitimacy in the film while at other times the cinematography is used very atmospherically to create a sense of melancholy to reflect the emotional experiences of the titular protagonist. John Cameron Mitchell finds ways to effectively tie the stylish nature of the film into the narrative as director and writer, and he uses it all to surround himself which hypes of the character he plays. Luckily enough he plays it perfectly.\nJohn Cameron Mitchell is clearly a very complex man because there is nothing simple about a character like Hedwig Robinson. Effectively enough, John Cameron Mitchell manages to play her to the bone in every area with nothing but expertise. John Cameron Mitchell shows off his singing talents in Hedwig and the Angry Inch to really draw audiences in to the entertaining musical numbers, but more importantly he captures the intrigue of viewers with just how dedicated he is to the role. He captures the dramatic spirit of the character by conveying just how difficult it is to exist in a society which rejects the concept of accepting transgender women. He manages to really show just how difficult it is to live with such pressure and such complex psychology. John Cameron Mitchell captures the depth of his role and the spirit which transcends it to make Hedwig Robinson a rock star at the same time, easily going between the two personas without fear or struggles at transitioning. His performance is what really draws viewers in, and he directs himself through the material with incredible finesse which makes it one of the more memorable transgender character to be portrayed on the cinematic screen.\n\nSo thanks to John Cameron Mitchell's tenacious leading performance and powerful work as writer and director, Hedwig and the Angry Inch is an entertaining and touching musical film despite its narrative inconsistencies and short running time.",

Fun, weird, and inspiring. As far as movies about german failed rockstars with a botched sex changed operation goes this one is really good. I love the theme and story and the emotional journey that hedwig takes as she comes to discover what it really means to be whole and what defines your sexuality. Great music, great story, maybe some artistic decisions including changes to story and setting aren't the best but overall a very enjoyable rock classic.",

Hedwig tells us of how she met her first lover, an American soldier who ended up leaving her later. Hedwig later met Tommy. The two of them shared their love of rock music and performing. While Hedwig was already well experienced with music and performing live, she helped Tommy become one of America's most popular rock stars, Tommy Gnosis.\nAs Tommy is majorly popular, Hedwig created her own band that travels around America performing small gigs at restaurants and other small venues to try to make a name of themselves and so Hedwig may feel whole as who she feels she is, despite her angry inch.\nJohn Cameron Mitchell gives a hell of a performance and I cannot wait to see NPH take on the role on Broadway.\nHedwig and the Angry Inch, I give you a 100%.",
