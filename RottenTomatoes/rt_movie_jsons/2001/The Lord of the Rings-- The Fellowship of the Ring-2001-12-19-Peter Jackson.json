Throughout the years, I have seen all the cartoons, listened to the books on tape, played with the lead figures in the 1970s as an early teen, etc. Back in early and mid 1970's, there wasn't a ton of LOR imagery and art. It was mostly in your head. This was before the Dungeons and Dragons explosion. Peter Jackson did an excellent version of these books. The characters look just like you imagined as a child reading the books. The introduction of the female elf character, in my opinion, even enhanced the stories and was well acted. I wished Jackson had carried all this quality into The Hobbit series that he made a little too much like a fantasy video game that was all over the place in parts. But that said, these 3 LOR movies are excellent and anyone would be hard pressed to out do them for many, many years to come.",

When it comes to fans of the Middle-Earth series (both movies and books) there is one thing most of us can agree on, that being that Peter Jackson basically did just as much for J.R.R. Tolkien's stories as J.R.R. Tolkien himself. This movie has aged amazingly well in my opinion, the VFX & SFX both hold up today. FOTR is the perfect first act to a three-part story while telling a fantastic and well-fleshed-out story itself, it has the perfect mix of whimsical and dark fantasy. It handles nine lead characters beautifully without taking from the primary story at hand, it gives each of its leads a moment to shine and gives most of them complete individual story arcs. If you're a fan of the books who's never seen the movies, a fantasy movie fanatic who's never seen the movies, or even someone who's read the books and seen the movies it's worth watching (for the first time or a rewatch). This movie trilogy is one of those rare occasions where something that should've been impossible became a colossal success, this poster boy of the heroes' journey shows what can happen when you are passionate enough about something.",

It's long but dense and very entertaining, with just the right mix of action, wit, pathos, and grand spectacle. Director/co-writer Peter Jackson and his production team bring Tolkien's words to vivid life, immersing us in a Middle Earth that feels at once fantastical yet organic and earthy. The location shooting in Jackson's native New Zealand is often stunning. The cast sparkles across the board, from Viggo Mortensen's reluctant hero, to Elijah Wood's curious and brave Hobbit, to Christopher Lee's menacing turn as the evil wizard Saruman. Sean Bean, Orlando Bloom, a blustery John Rhys-Davies, and especially Sean Astin make great fellowship mates. Ian McKellen is just grand as the wise and weary Gandalf. But two of the best moments go to the women in this tale, Liv Tyler and the luminous Cate Blanchett. What sets this apart from other inferior fantasy fare is the gravitas of the story. Death isn't greeted with one-liners, but with fear and grief. Each loss in the journey is deeply felt. The victories--small and large--are thrilling. It's a sweeping epic, one that gets us engrossed and involved, and makes us anticipate the next chapter of this saga",

I'd never read any of Tolkien's books when I saw the film for the first time at the theatre and, now that I've read them, in retrospect I think being a neophyte to the mythology made my LOTR movie experience all the more miraculous.\n\nI loved The Two Towers and Return of the King almost as much as FOTR, but not quite, because seeing Fellowship for the first time was like taking a journey to a fabulous new place and meeting incredible new friends that you don't want to leave. I've never felt anything quite like what this epic evoked in me. It was akin to being a child again, with that tireless sense of wonder and enjoyment of each and every moment, maybe because as a child you are discovering your surroundings, and whatever age you are, when you watch the Fellowship of the Ring you are rendered in awe upon being introduced to the purity and beauty of Middle Earth and darkly enthralled by the majesty of Eisengard, Saruman, Sauron and all of their mighty malice. One of the things that makes this movie so special (and there are so many!) is that you fall in love not only with the \"good\" characters, but also with the \"evil\" ones. For example, Christopher Lee was amazing as Saruman, and I can't imagine the movie without him.\n\nSome films that might be comparable to the Lord of the Rings trilogy are: The Fifth Element, the Star Wars Trilogy parts IV, V and VI (forget the newer prequels), the Matrix trilogy (especially the first part), Interview with a Vampire, the Legend of Sleepy Hollow (with Johnny Depp), Logan's Run and The Island. They are all excellent movies and works of art that weave that movie magic that keeps you spellbound and entranced for the duration of their runtime.\n\nBut after seeing The Fellowship of the Ring, I knew I had found the movie by which I would judge all other movies. Based on J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved books, Peter Jackson has set a new standard in the industry of cinema, one that I honestly think has not and won't be surpassed, at least not in my lifetime, not even by PJ himself.\n\nIt is truly an instant classic that will stand the test of time and be loved by generations to come. God Bless Tolkien and Jackson and everyone involved in the conception and making of this film, for creating a world that is at my fingertips, only takes the touch of a button to go to whenever I want, and makes me forget everything else.\n\nThe LOTR Trilogy is undoubtedly MY precious, the non plus ultra of all movies!",
