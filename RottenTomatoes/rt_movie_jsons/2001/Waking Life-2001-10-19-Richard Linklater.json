    "summary": "Transcending the boundaries of technology and imagination, \"Waking Life\" is a revolutionary breakthrough in film animation. In \"Waking Life,\" Wiley Wiggins (\"Dazed and Confused\") travels through a series of encounters and observations in a world that may or may not be reality. It is this surreal existence, flourishing with endless ideas and possibilities, that ultimately leads to the question -- Are we sleep-walking through our waking state or wake-walking through our dreams?",

            "content": "\"Waking Life\" is an extraordinary masterpiece of a film that defies classification and challenges the very nature of what it means to be alive. Directed by Richard Linklater, this film is a stunning work of art that seamlessly blends animation and live-action footage to create a visual and philosophical feast for the senses.\n\nThe film follows a young man named Wiley Wiggins as he drifts through a series of dream-like encounters with various characters, all of whom offer unique perspectives on the nature of existence, consciousness, and reality itself. The film is a deep exploration of the human experience, with profound insights that will leave you pondering long after the credits have rolled.\n\nThe animation style of the film is truly breathtaking. Each frame is a work of art in its own right, with vibrant colors and complex visual patterns that capture the surreal nature of the dream world. The use of rotoscoping, a technique in which live-action footage is traced over and transformed into animation, adds an extra layer of depth and texture to the film.\n\nBut \"Waking Life\" is not just visually stunning; it's also a deeply philosophical work that explores some of the most fundamental questions of human existence. The film is filled with fascinating discussions about the nature of consciousness, the meaning of life, and the relationship between dreams and reality.\n\nOverall, \"Waking Life\" is an incredible cinematic achievement that will leave you both mesmerized and intellectually stimulated. It's a film that will stay with you long after you've watched it, and one that you'll find yourself returning to again and again to uncover new insights and revelations. Highly recommended for anyone who loves thought-provoking films that push the boundaries of what cinema can achieve.",

            "content": "Remember, since Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy portray the same characters in both, you're not done with Linklater's Before Trilogy until you watch Waking Life. \n\nIs Waking Life an imaginative look at the nature of reality, or Inception for philosophy majors? I think if you walk into this film with the expectation that all the debates about existence and time will rewrite your understanding of your own life, you run the risk of being flooded with word soup, nodding along to the dialogue while checking your watch, or completely checking out and dropping the film entirely. Instead, the best bet might not be to watch the film for the contents of the debates but for the conversations themselves, to get in touch with Linklater's ideas about the process of becoming self-aware and understanding your surroundings; it's not like everyone is going to relate to getting picked up at the station by a random stranger driving a car-boat. \n\nIt's easy to write off the content of the film as academic prattle (given that virtually the entire runtime is existential speeches), but I think that's mostly just out of boredom or becoming desensitized thanks to big budget action movies; if you're willing to give the film a chance the tiny little episodes each have their own unique identity, and the rotoscoped visuals (later to be reused in A Scanner Darkly to emulate the effects of drug addiction) give the film the dreamlike quality that suits a main character that is, well, in a dream. It might not open your third eye and allow you to achieve enlightenment, but it is one of the more interesting examples of a director trying to ask questions about life without coming off as totally pedantic or silly. (3.5/5)",

            "content": "Super perfundo on the early eve of your day\n\nThis is the interpretation that I choose, that many critics have overlooked. I propose that the theme of this movie is more about birth than death. \"Waking Life\", although based on the extremity of uncertainties, is in my eye, less than guaranteeing the prophecy of the end to our human spirit. It isn't even guessing that you'll die without knowing the grandness of our universe. It is quite simply telling you that you'll always be positive of your soul's origin, everything that will happen to you is a prescription of morality, with decreasing potency as distance increases, until the inevitably and infinitely mysterious unforeseeable end of action. The film, in my opinion, implies that we are witnessing the poetic birth of a soul into the sphere of life.\n\nAll in all, Linklater has broken the mold of film production. His reminiscent air of nostalgia for the loss of time as golden as spent, does justice to the robbers of the human spirit, as the emotional outlook that captures us all when we look into the eyes of a photo album and feel the burden of a succession of guilt over the advancement of dreams.",

            "content": "Waking Life is hit or miss. I know I just excoriated Holy Motors for not having a plot and I understand any perceived hypocrisy, but Waking Life is more of a surreal experience wherein you happen to run into every wayward, Gen X philosopher on your travels throughout Austin, TX connected by an engorging thread, whereas Holy Motors is a series of vignettes lacking any discernible connection or pertinent takeaways. The conversations and soliloquies are far more captivating and would've been similarly enjoyable, had the film been live-action. Instead, the animation is a potpourri of various artistic styles via rotoscope. The nameless run-ins include a wide range of \"characters\" including Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy (reprising their roles from Before Sunrise), Timothy \"Speed\" Levitch, Steven Soderbergh, Alex Jones, Charles Gunning, Kim Kirzan, and Richard Linklater himself, et al. Sure, there are lots of Gen X concerns over consumerism, which seems to have faded with the 2000s, but that aside it's hard not to find Gen X to be one of the better philosophical generations when it comes to purpose and our reality (whether addressing the collective or the individual), even if it comes off as pretentious. A plot does form here wherein the protag (Wiley Wiggins), becomes stuck in an Inception-like dream-loop and takes a more active role in questioning those he encounters in an effort to break the wheel. The final conversation, between the protag and Linklater himself, concerning Philip K. Dick and the Bible, was my favorite. I'm into movies and plays where people really just\u2026 talk. When I realized the form of this movie I was nervous that it'd feel like more of a Rolodex of Philosophy professors talking at you in a campus coffee shop, but there weren't any speakers I wanted to shut up. Like I said, it's hit or miss, but if you're interested in an hour and a half of existential, philosophical talks and mesmerizing animation, I can't recommend Waking Life enough.",

Completely mind blowing!!\n\nCan you imagine holding up a conversation with someone for almost 2 hours; non-stop? no way, you'd get bored, sleepy, hungry, or any other human need would emerge, regardless of how close this person is or how harmonized you two are. Well, Mr. Linklater puts you in that situation, and you don't feel bored, nor do you feel anything but drowning in \"his\" conversations.

You are in the dream, swerving with it, feeling out of breath while not actually moving or exerting any efforts.\n\nThe idea itself, while it may make you feel nervous or give you the feeling of being trapped (intentionally i believe!) is a total mind f**k.

Rather than being tied together by a plot or a small group of characters, the film is tied together by the existential conversations of its hundred unnamed characters.  As a result it feels too disjointed for my taste.  This film requires a lot of focus in order to wrap your mind around its high-brow philosophical concepts, especially since there is basically no reprieve from the constant flow of ideas.  The conversations will truly challenge your mind, but it's a lot to digest during a 100-minute movie.  The film is immediately recognizable from its surreal rotoscoping animation technique.  There is truly no other movie that looks like this one.  While the visual appeal is a strong point of the movie, there are definitely points where the film would work better as a book on tape so that you could focus on the concepts without being distracted by the images.

Life, Death, Freewill, Recorded History, Society, Politics, Behaviors.. you name it, Linklater covers it all in a span of 90 minutes. There's so much here, it's just too much to take in. It demands patience, intelligence and repeated viewings. Unfortunately, I think this will only be a one time experience for me. This film is astounding and absorbing in many of its parts, but it asks a lot of your mind to take. I think it was a great decision to animate this in vivid rotoscope, because without it, many audiences would get restless and annoyed. I really admire Linklater as a director, for challenging the way we watch movies, and the way we think about ourselves and others.

The acting is great in this and so is the writing. The conversations the characters talk about gives you a bit of perspective of what the character is like which rarely happens and more or less just shows you in most of the films. It never felt like they're talking out of their rear ends as they are connected to the film. People would say that it's very boring which I can see that as when it's getting close to the end, I was getting a bit bored and was waiting for it to end, but you would probably never get one of those experiences like Waking Life that tries to be different in terms of creative style and also make the boring topics, for most people as I know that there's some people that find these topics interesting in its own thing, quite investing.",

            "content": "Waking Life is something strange, but also something exhilarating in how it opens your mind. It demands every aspect of your attention and it makes your brain open in ways few films ever manage to do. At first, watching the film feels a bit disorienting, especially with such unusual animation and hearing the characters engage in their various discussions, but once you open your mind and let it explore what Waking Life has to offer, you will be in for something extraordinary and unlike anything you have or ever will see.\n\nThe story focuses on a young man who drifts in and out dreams, not knowing if he is ever truly awake, or dreaming still. During this strange odyssey, he engages, listens, and observes various colorful characters and how they discuss numerous topics like dreams vs. reality, existentialism, philosophy, politics, life, and several other things - each with their own strange animation to go along with them as he dives deep into such unknown territory. \n\nWhat makes the story so engaging is in how abstract it is. You never know what bizarre character or scenario you'll come across, but you'll always be eager to hear what the characters have to say next because they have A LOT to say about their topics. Though it can be confusing, it's never in a bad way, but rather, it mimics the enigmatic and elusive nature of dreams. Plus, with such a colorful cast of characters along the journey, it's certainly never boring.\n\nWhile most of the cast is comprised of unknowns, the cast as a whole is quite good, even though many of them have very brief roles before the main character finds his way to another conversation. They dive headfirst into the madness, bringing life to their unusual characters with a wide variety of emotions - subtle and intense. There is not one dull or weak performance.\n\nAs far as entertainment goes, this will depend on how much quirkiness you are willing to put up with from your films. For me, as someone who enjoys strange films, I found it to be endlessly entertaining and fascinating. It's a very cerebral and thought-provoking film bolstered by unusual animation, which itself will be polarizing for a viewer - you will either love it, or find it horrid to look at. The film opens the viewer up to a wide variety of discussions and it will be a long time before this film leaves you because it stimulates your brain so well. However, there is also a possibility that you will hate it and find it to be pretentious nonsense. \n\nIf you love animated films - and I mean animated films of all kinds, not just kid-oriented ones - Waking Life is a must-see. It's a real mind blower of a film. And if you hate it, at least give a second viewing before writing it off. I think it is a phenomenal film, and easily among the greatest animated films and films altogether that I've ever seen.",

Richard Linklater is such a consistently fascinating filmmaker; he keeps exploring complex philosophical territory in the most down-to-earth ways. The Before trilogy provides a fascinating reflection on time and relationships; though I haven't seen it yet, presumably his latest film Boyhood also does interesting things with time and the nature of human experience. Even his more mainstream films, like School of Rock, Bernie, and Me & Orson Welles, are all unique and quite enjoyable.  The film, from 2001, is perhaps his most obviously intellectualized; I can't think of many other films that feature prolonged discussions of Andre Bazin or say the word \"ontology\" so casually. \n\nSome people will find the movie frustrating; certainly it resembles few other films, either in style or content. The film's technique is the most immediately obvious distinguishing feature; it was created with an animated technique known as \"rotoscoping,\" in which the filmmaker first shoots live-action footage and animators later paint over it, either physically or digitally (in this case, digitally). The animation has a deliberately unstable, woozy feeling: characters' eyes seem to float off of their head and back, backgrounds shift around as if everything were at sea, and surreal little doodles appear and disappear without warning. The whole thing is meant to evoke the atmosphere of a dream, which is appropriate given that so much of the movie is explicitly about dreaming and might actually be taking place in a dream. As far as the \"story,\" such as it is, we get a nameless protagonist wandering around talking to an endless stream of people who all have intense and intricate thoughts on various philosophical and theoretical matters. A few of the characters are recognizable - Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy appear, possibly as alternate-universe versions of their Before Sunrise characters, and Linklater himself is in the film's penultimate scene. Mostly, though, the characters seem to be played by non-actors, and I suspect a few people are more or less playing themselves. The characters talk and talk about different matters, and the film never tries to tie it all together into a plot or coherent overall argument; instead, like a dream, it just sort of drifts from one thing to the next. It's the sort of movie you would need to watch a couple of times to really get to the bottom of; but after one viewing, I can definitely say that I enjoyed it, and found it to be possibly the most distinctive of all of Linklater's films (at least, out of the ones I've seen so far).",

I felt like I was briefly sitting in on a bunch of philosophy lectures, many of which just irritated me--either because they were absurd or because they were laced with meaningless intellectual mumbo-jumbo. Granted, some of the ideas were interesting and thought-provoking, but many were not, and regardless of the quality, the presentation of these ideas was too often soaked in academic arrogance and absurdity. There was simply too much unnecessary and useless complex terminology and figurative language that it just put me off more than it made me want to learn. \nI must stress that while I am not personally intensely interested in the intricacies of philosophy, I do believe that many philosophical ideas are interesting, thought-provoking, and worthy of discussion; however, this was not my experience with this movie. Overall, I felt that in their attempt to make an artsy, educational movie, they ended up with more of a pretentious lecture series that was often deliberately confusing and cryptic. \nThis movie epitomizes my distaste for BS deep philosophical discussions.

It's about a young man who wanders through a dream, unable to wake up, encountering multiple deep thinkers who pontificate about the meaning of life, the universe, and everything.\n\nIt's directed by Richard Linklater, who is quite the auteur when it comes to off-beat movies, and it's similar to the director's later film A Scanner Darkly (2005). Waking Life is rotoscope animated, and the result is truly stunning. Often, the tone of a scene is matched by the animation style, which does vary from scene to scene, be it a stark, angular setting or a wobbly, unsettled conversation. It's tough to overstate how technically exemplary this movie is; without the animation, perhaps, the film could seem unaccessible by those who dislike excessive talking in their films. Instead, the visual style complements the dialogue (often, monologue). Think of Waking Life as My Dinner with Andre, only with more characters and compelling art direction. This isn't just two dudes discussing life over dinner; it's practically an out-of-body experience for both the viewer and our protagonist.\n\nAmong those characters encountered in the movie are Celine (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) from Linklater's \"Before\" trilogy, activist Alex Jones, director Steven Soderbergh, Speed Levitch, actor Caveh Zahedi, composer Guy Forsyth, writer Kim Krizan, and Linklater himself. And did you know that in dreams, if you flip a light switch, nothing happens? That's how you know you're in a dream. Also, in dreams, our brains cannot accurately interpret digital numbers, so an alarm clock looks all weirdly disjointed. Sort of how we feel in a dream, I guess. Our protagonist, played by Wiley Wiggins, wakes up a few times from a dream, only to find he's in another dream. Some serious Inception going on there. He's experiencing lucid dreaming, where he can recognize faces and hold conversations at length and then remember it when he awakes, if that happens.\n\nThe discussions aren't just about dreams, though; topics include language, existentialism itself, conditioning of the human species, the length of an instant, and reincarnation. Linklater and his cohorts have a way of orating that doesn't come off as so much mumbo-jumbo, or as condescension, or as a lecture. Wondrous to behold, Waking Life is a pensive work of art.",

            "content": "Richard Linklater is back to his roots by making talkative, do-little experimental films about people rambling on about whatever, you know, because that's exactly what we've been hoping he would do. Yes, even though this came before Linklater's \"A Scanner Darkly\", it's pretty much a combination of that and \"Slacker\", which is totally bogus, because Linklater should have gone with \"Dazed and Confused\" if he was going animate any of his live-action films in this super-psychedelic fashion. Man, this film is kind of weird, and yet, the most interesting thing about it remains the fact that Linklater managed to figure out some way to make an animated film boring, which isn't really too surprising, because you're asking for trouble if you're mixing the cartoons that the kids are into with the over-the-top philosophical mumbo-jumbo that the... college kids are into. Let's be honest, folks, once you grow up, you don't have a whole lot of time to think about this stuff, and I figured once Linklater got out of college he wouldn't have time to come up with all the scholar ramblings that he ever so adorably tried so hard to impress us with in some of his early work. Of course, then again, a few years after this, he did \"School of Rock\", so he apparently really got into revisiting the old school days for a while in the early 2000s. Yeah, this film needs a serious case of Jack Black, although he looks enough like a panda in real life that if you turned him into a cartoon, he would always end up looking like Po from \"Kung-Fu Panda\", and that would surely lead to some jerk starting up some philosophical speech regarding panda endangerment or some junk. Whoever says that life would be more exciting if it was animated should probably see this film, and I guess I'm comfortable saying that, because event though this film is a little too much, it has a few things that might keep it going at times.\r\n\r\nA self-respecting, aggressively dry avant-garde feature, this film naturally underuses Glover Gill's score for fear of having some consistent liveliness or something, but when Gill's efforts do come into play, they prove to be worth waiting for, being themselves abstract, but in an effective way whose classical taste haunts as complimentary to atmosphere to the point of immersing you into the depths of the film, perhaps more so than visual style. I suppose the trippy animation style fits the strangeness of this very experimental film, but it hardly does much beyond exacerbate a sense of distance from humanity to substance, and yet, on the whole, the visual style of this film is commendable, at least in its sheer uniqueness, with a beautiful bounce to coloration and often hypnotic abstractionism to the structuring of imagery. The film is nothing if not stylish, and no matter how sloppy its narrative style is, visual style, in addition to the underexplored musical style excel, making for a technically distinguished and often even breathtaking affair that still has a tendency to place remarkable style over substance. Substance is indeed lacking in this overstylized and abstract project, but if there is a narrative, its uniqueness, alone, is intriguing, and it helps that subject matter dealing with the depths of human interaction, life, existentialism and philosophy has a value to it that is handled so wrong, yet could have been handled right. In all honesty, there are a number of times in which Richard Linklater really does handle this subject matter right, at least as screenwriter, getting a little pretentious, but generally sharp and audaciously thorough in exploring profound philosophical themes that, at least to those open to embracing convoluted ramblings of this nature, really are interesting, maybe even entertaining when Linklater plays with style in a slick enough fashion to sustain occasions of tight pace amid much slowness. I don't exactly address it too much, but I would fancy myself an intellectual who has great admiration for philosophy and extensive thought, so on that level, I'll go so far as to say that I have a great deal of respect for this film which is generally a borderline failure as entertainment, despite intellectual and aesthetic values that are rich enough to provide highlights, some of which give a glimpse of a stronger, more worthy vehicle of worthy themes. Of course, when it's all said and done, more than it tests your intellectual thoughtfulness, the film tests your patience, being yet another overblown misfire of an artistic license by Linklater that primarily squanders your time, and plenty of it.\r\n\r\nAt just over 100 minutes, the film isn't too long, but it is overlong, even in the context of an intentionally aimless, narratively thin and altogether odd structure, bloating filler and dragging many other elements out, but always doomed to be uneven, due to an exhausting amount of layers and segments, between which is rarely fluid transition. The film is all over the place, and reaches its ostensibly intentionally inconsistent beats ever so limply, yet a big reason why it's so uneven is because it barely tried to slow down in a way that allows you to soak up exposition, the lack of which distances you from the depth of characters so inconsequential that even Wiley Wiggins' nameless protagonist or avatar audience role is often abandoned for no sensible reason. As character-driven as this film's pseudo-narrative is, the characters, no matter how dynamic and about as well-portrayed as they can be by talents with little acting material to play upon, feel too much like no much more than mere vehicles for themes, with no real depth to get you dramatically involved into the substance through all of the style. Narrative overstylization betrays substance, and visual overstylization doesn't help, for although the animations and other forms of experimental visuals aesthetically impress, the active dehumanization to the animation further devalues depths that are shaken up enough by the aforementioned unfocused and uneven characterization, and when abstract happenings come into play in the form of anything from random visuals to sequences of avant-garde filler, they further thin a narrative that, as irony would have, is built upon style over substance. Basically a much more intellectually and stylistically experimental take on ideas behind, say, Richard Linklater's \"Slacker\", this film, as an exploration of strange human interactions and trippy philosophy, has no real narrative, with interesting themes, but too thin of an interpretation for the sake of investment that might be compensated for if the film wasn't so dull. I suppose the patient ought to find some entertainment value to the cleverly, if often pretentiously written chatter, but once you get too used to the for it to entertain, the film is more-or-less nothing if not boring, with a dryness that stiffens pacing which is messed up enough by uneven structuring and an unfocused non-narrative, and aggravates about as much as a sense of pride that looms too prominently throughout the final product. The film fulfills ambition in enough areas to make for an at least borderline decent watch that would have been if there was a charm to Linklater's efforts, but alas, Linklater's project feels more self-congratulatory than endearing in its ambition, and that's frustrating on a level that may not destroy the film, but certainly drives this misguided mess to the brink of contempt.\r\n\r\nWhen the dream is done, tasteful scoring and a uniquely remarkable visual style, if not refreshing subject matter that is often done justice by sharp highlights in thoughtful writing and direction provide glimpses of a stronger vehicle for intriguing subject matter, but under the pressure of draggy and uneven structuring, unfocused characterization and a dull dryness to the interpretation of a thin, overly strange narrative, intensified by a sense of pretense, Richard Linklater's \"Waking Life\" collapses to the brink of contempt as an overwrought experimental portrait on philosophical interactions within, and the thin line between dream and reality.\r\n\r\n2/5 - Weak",

Then a group of artists created 2D computer animation on top of every scene, exaggerating certain features in characters' faces, and taking liberties with the atmosphere's perspective.  It just looks crazy.  It's both dreamlike and sickening.  I love the basis of the story.  A young man is unable to escape his dreams and begins a search for himself in order to get back to waking life.  I was pumped with the anticipation of having my mind blown.  But mid-way through the movie I felt so lost.  Waking Life is filled with about 10 extensive, philosophical lectures which made the movie almost completely inaccessible for me.  I'm beginning to think Linklater had a couple drinks with some philosophy and psychology majors and let the cameras roll while they rattled off a bunch of quotes, book references, and theories.  Each scene seems to be devoid of any real idea.  But isn't that what makes it so surreal?  I don't know if Waking Life is genius, or just pretentious.  8/10 for that animation!

Really, one has to want to be engaged by the contemplative style, because the film does require work on the part of the viewer. However, it is one of the few films that does improve with multiple viewings, and should be watched just for the brilliant artistic choice. The rotoscope allows for a familiar, but unearthly feel, which Linklater also attempted with A Scanner Darkly. It has its high and low points, but it's just so thought provoking, and even if you don't agree with its opinion, it's cool with that. It would have a friendly discussion with you if it could talk back.

It's the film's thoughts and ideas that are so hilarious, that it makes you wonder why we make our lives so miserable, after all we are just living dreams.",

It has a lot of thought provoking ideas and conversations and if you feel it goes nowhere at least one could appreciate the cool artful approach of the animation.

'Waking Life' is so rich and full of ideas. I'm so glad that I chose to watch this, and I can't wait to watch it again - next time with someone else, as opposed to alone like I have done just now. Please, if you have the chance, watch this movie. I doubt you would regret it.",
