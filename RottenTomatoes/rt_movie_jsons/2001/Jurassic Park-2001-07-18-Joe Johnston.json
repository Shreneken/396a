The dinosaurs were better than ever and the more than competent cast, led by the always excellent Sam Neil, did a terrific job of bringing the various characters to life. I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Strongly recommended, 9/10.",

However, the plot feels rushed and lacks the depth and complexity of the previous Jurassic Park films.\n\nThe film's characters are not as well-developed as in previous films, and some of their motivations and actions feel contrived. Additionally, the movie relies heavily on cheap jump scares rather than building suspense through careful pacing and storytelling.\n\nDespite these flaws, the film still delivers on its promise of thrilling dinosaur action, and the visual effects are impressive. Fans of the Jurassic Park franchise will likely enjoy this installment, but it falls short of the high standards set by its predecessors.\n\nOverall, Jurassic Park 3 is a decent addition to the franchise, but it lacks the depth and innovation of the original film. While it may provide some excitement for dinosaur enthusiasts, it ultimately fails to live up to its potential.",

            "content": "Jurassic Park III, released in 2001 and directed by Joe Johnston, has often been overlooked and dismissed by critics as a mere cash-grab sequel to the popular Jurassic Park franchise. However, upon closer inspection, the film deserves more credit than it has been given.\n\nThe film follows Dr. Alan Grant, played by Sam Neill reprising his role from the first film, as he is persuaded to return to Isla Sorna, the site of the second dinosaur breeding facility, by a wealthy couple who are searching for their missing son. Along the way, they encounter various prehistoric creatures and must fight for their survival.\n\nAlthough the film lacks the groundbreaking special effects of the first two Jurassic Park films, it still manages to deliver some impressive action sequences and thrilling moments. The introduction of new dinosaur species, such as the Spinosaurus, adds to the excitement and intrigue of the film.\n\nMoreover, the film's focus on character development and relationships, particularly between Dr. Grant and the young boy he is trying to save, adds a layer of emotional depth to the story that was lacking in some of the previous films. The performances by the cast, including William H. Macy and T\u00e9a Leoni, are also notable and add to the film's overall quality.\n\nIn conclusion, while Jurassic Park III may not have achieved the same critical acclaim as its predecessors, it is a solid addition to the franchise that deserves more credit than it has been given. The film's focus on character development and relationships, along with its impressive action sequences and introduction of new dinosaur species, make it an entertaining and worthwhile entry in the series.",

            "content": "It's a bit better than I remember but not by much. The main weakness is the acting is just ok overall. Grant is the best thing and starts out good but as things progress he doesn't have as much to work with as most of his time is just spent running away from dinosaurs rather than any character development. The kid is decent also. Amanda is the worst character and is a borderline idiot doing DUMB actions throughout. (The megaphone, not locking the birdcage) Billy isn't much better and is dumb but also EXTRMELY forgettable. The rest are just ok. They don't really have any charm outside of Grant or chemistry besides Grant and the kid. The cinematography is decent with a strong moody atmosphere but also comes across as dull and lifeless as well. This movie would've probably benefitted from being done in black and white I feel. Also, quite a bit of the locale was already seen in the last one so it doesn't really do anything new there. The action scenes are the best part of this. They are good overall especially the plane scene. The special effects are pretty decent with not bad CGI and good practical. There are some dumb scenes and farfetched ones like the ending which felt more convenient than anything (Especially how did they get Billy which was probably cut). The music isn't bad but only because it reminds me of the first more often than giving this one an identity. The editing and pacing are decent also as this isn't very long, not bloated, and is more focused than the second one. I would say if your a die hard fan of Dinosaurs than see this and Lost World at least once to decide which one you like better. Personally this was slightly better for me though the Lost World which I'm more nostalgic for and my favorite part of any of the 2, the San Diego ending. This also BARELY got the 3.5 from me as well.",

The plot was lame and Sam Neal played the only character I cared about. This film again seriously suffered by not having all the original cast back. The film also felt the smallest in scale of all the movies. You could tell they filmed more inside a studio this time. That being said, it's still an enjoyable popcorn movie with good effects and some good action sequences. I've seen this one a bunch and still find it fun every now and then.

Lets start with the things i liked, my boy Sam Neill is back and gives a great performance, maybe a little nostalgia driven but i dont care. The VFX and production design are still so great and John WIlliams his score is still incredible. The movie has some cool action sequences and some bad once, i think the problem was the fact that there were way to many. So lets start with the bad, i didn't care a dam about anyone outside of Sam Neill, i even cared more about Laura Dern sitting at home, why was she just not in this movie. The editing in this movie is awfull, it takes everything that Steven Spielberg built and just cuts arround in it. The plot is just stupid, how did the studio green light this. I am not gonna lie and say that there was not at least a bit nostalgia for this entry in the Jurassic Park franchise, but at the end i just wanted it to be over. It really felt like the studio and writers had no idea's for this movie, the ending felt really rushed and that on a runtime of 1.30 hours is really bad. Overall it had some goods, but most of it was quite bad",

In part one\u00a0the cast\u00a0was spread out making the story big amongst the characters, the second part has a way bigger cast, an entire team to hunt Dino's, this time it was\u00a0scaled down, not only the cast but the run time of the movie aswell.

They even put Ellie into this movie and she doesn't even do anything. What were the writers thinking? The CGI is still mostly good, but I thought there are a few bad CGI moments, especially with the Ceratosaurus. But the biggest problem with this movie is the screenplay, which was still being written while they were filming which is just ridiculous. If you wanted this movie to be the culmination of the Jurassic Park trilogy, then you should've brought everyone back from the previous two movies and had them go on a big epic journey  across Isla Sorna together.

Next best is the bold decision of having the t-rex get got in favor of the Spinosaurus, which is a cool dino in and of itself. Also, I like that they had Alan mostly tricked into coming back onto the island since it wouldnt make sense for him to come back another way. And the kid in this, a dino nerd able to use his knowledge to survive this long, is a good approach. And I like utilizing Pterodactyls more meaningfully. But beyond that, this film is just a very brief foray into dodge dino attack simulator. William H. Macy is supposed to have an arc of going from weak stuffy emasculated man to a brave, capable hero, which is fine but you don't really buy it. Mrs. Kirby oscillattes between being gratingly annoying and unfathomably stupid (saying \"for what?\" in response to it's a bird cage). There's no real other human characters than obvious killcount feed (except for Grant's student that comes along that I entirely forgot lmaooo); there's no ethical or philosphical debate about dinos anymore, certainly no science fiction beyond saying Velociraptors are smart and social [which we knew]. The ending with the spinosaurus is kinda anticlimactic cause it just walks away instead of going raound the fire. The ending with the velociraptors is stupid because they want the woman to give the eggs back (why? they know she doens't have it, and she certainly hasn't acted like the alpha of the group), but then Alan uses the 3-d printed raptor skull to do a call to them (whY), then adjusts to do a call for help (WHY, you want them to leave, and they aren't going to think it's a call for help from somewhere else). Then they pick up the eggs and leave because of the helicopter sounds. And then they arrive on the beach and the full might of the military is on this island because of a hunch from Ellie Sattler about a few civilians she thinks MIGHT be on the island (she seemed very confused in that call from Grant). Then pterodactyls are flying off the island and that's framed as a GOOD thing? And why are they flying off now? Are they going to Nublar or the rest of the world? AHH. Dumb things, characters we don't care for, set pieces that sometimes are interesting but ultimtately aren't able to make up for any of the other shortcomings, no deeper themes, no real arc for our main man Grant. It's a small side story in the Jurassic Park mythos, and while it isn't the worst thing ever, it's not nearly as riveting as its 1993 ancestor.",

This fm really is just a showcase for action and set pieces really and the actual story isn't particularly great or well executed. It's not terrible though.\nThe CGI is very inconsistent in terms of quality and lots of experimenting was going on with coloring of the dinosaurs which is very hit and miss.

The spinosaurus attack scene is one of my favorite dinosaur action scenes in this whole franchise! Same with the pteranadon attack scene! This movie just overall is just a blast from start to finish!

This movie failed to execute a worth while adventure in the most spectacular way. I can't see where the 93 million dollars went, the Spinosaurus looks absolutely hideous. Some of the other dinosaurs don't look that bad. I also don't have any idea of the motivation how the same Spinosaurus  \"spawned\" near they main characters: 1. Right before they were going to leave the island. 2. As soon as they crashed a good at least a mile away from the last confrontation in the forest. 3. Right before going into the bird cage. 4. In the dam water. I honestly couldn't tell you why this dinosaur spawned near the main characters and literally went cereal killer on the main characters lol. It was like this dam dinosaur was wronged by one of the main characters and his/her favorite meal is human \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02.  In the first movie the T-Rex in Jurassic Park seemed like a believable monster this dam dinosaur was like  you took my food so I'm here to kill you today \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude02. The main dinosaur,  Spinosaurus, in this film was created just to chase after the main characters. When I saw the dinosaur the 3rd time right before the bird cage I started to die laughing because the dam Dino stared into the camera breaking the fourth wall and said to the characters time for you to run and scream... \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 speaking about screaming dam the mother didn't stop. Not to be rude but the first thing you do when you go to dinosaur island trying to see if your son is alive you take a megaphone and starting yelling \"Erik\".... \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude48 could we next time find a confident female lead character in a movie. I can't believe for a second that Erik was the kid of his two idiotic parents. Erik had to be Dr. Grant's kid because he was at least more intelligent than his stupid parents.

            "content": "This time, it's not just a walk in the park. The third installment in everyone's favorite dinosaur blockbuster franchise. Paleontologist Alan Grant from the first film has ended his relationship with his former partner Ellie Sattler, though they are still good friends. Dr. Grant now works with his new assistant Billy Brennan, who have recently made a fascinating discovery on raptors. However, they are facing a problem: they are running out of money for their research. Luckily, Paul and Amanda Kirby, a wealthy couple willing to offer them enough money to continue their research, if they give them an aerial tour of Isla Sorna. Grant and Billy reluctantly agree, despite Grant mentioning earlier in the film that he would never visit Site B. They then head off on an airplane to the island. However, their plane shortly crash-lands in the jungle, leaving Grant and the survivors stranded there. The Kirbys then reveal the real reason they brought Grant here: they are a middle-class divorced couple searching for their lost son Eric who crashed on the island a few weeks earlier. Grant is furious about being tricked, but soon learns they have bigger problems. InGen has been creating deadlier and advanced breeds of dinosaurs. This results in another battle for survival between man and nature. Jurassic Park 3 is not an astounding sequel. It lacks the magic and charm of Spielberg's film. And that's not just because the film feels like a network drama episode. The main problem with this movie is dumb human characters. The only likeable characters that really stood out to me were Alan Grant (obviously) and the Kirby kid, Eric. The rest of them weren't very interesting. The film spends way too much time on its boring characters instead of the giant dinosaurs, whom I wished to see get eaten. Especially the Kirby couple who are stereotypical and constantly arguing over their marriage and lives. Amanda was more annoying as she kept putting everyone in danger, thanks to her foolishness. The film is also basically just a chase scene. On more positive notes, the film is much better than The Lost World: Jurassic Park (my dearest apologies to Mr. Spielberg) as it just gets straight to the point where dinosaurs start eating people. I would also like to point out Grant's dream sequence where a raptor \"speaks\" to him was quite amusing to watch, despite its stupidity. Don Davis's score is suspenseful and tense, with elements of John Williams' original theme. Joe Johnston is definitely no Spielberg, but proves he is capable of directing an effective thrill ride that will leave you hanging on the seat in suspense.",

The plot is non-existent, through the action scenes can be fun, but the look of the film is pure TV movie. The bird-cage scene and the encounter with the raptors are all great, but aside from that, there's nothing worth watching here. Easily the worst of the franchise. | Grade: D+",

The movie gets boring and bland. The new big bad dinosaur known as the Spinosaurus just feels like a big slap to the face. This film separated the fanbase, spino fans and T Rex fans. They didn't even bother to make new music other than Paul and Amanda Kirby's theme which was not memorable at all. I've heard that they started filming with no script so that really explains a lot. Overall, this is a bad movie but quite enjoyable for those who like monster action.",

The second movie stated that Isla Sorna had no fences or compounds, but this movie pays no attention to logic and made stuff up reintroducing fences and compounds. Then, since the movie had no original material, it steals thrown out scenes from the first book and introduces them to the third movie. It is so bad that it makes up a dinosaur that kills the T-Rex with 0 explanation. That same mega dinosaur was able to headbutt its way through a reinforced 30\u2019 tall fence, but seconds later was inexplicably stopped by a 5\u2019 high sheet metal gate protecting the humans.

I would've preferred more of the movie to take place in the daytime and more panoramic establishing shots given the beautiful locations they chose for shooting, and they didn't rely enough on the animatronics as 2001-era CGI is not retrospectively as impressive as they seemed to think: the dinosaurs seemed less realistic here.

This movie may well be the worst movie ever made and I mean that with all due respect for the countless duds out there across the globe. It is hard to know where to begin. From the utterly absurd action scenes to the omnipresent spinosaurus to the world's physically fittest and mentally resilient main characters to the indestructible satellite phone to the unbelievably abysmal script, this movie was breathtakingly bad. It literally took my breath away on many occasions, leaving me in a state of winded incredulity. What further contributes to making the film's level so shockingly low is that it actually boasts a very high calibre cast who apparently either wrote their own cheque to appear or who signed on without even glancing at the script. Words cannot do this movie justice. If I had to give it a rating not out of 5 stars, but out of all the stars in the universe, it would still get less than one.",

            "content": "I never understood the hatred for Jurassic Park III, and I was glad to see when I returned to it this week, it was as enjoyable as I remembered. Considering the mess that was The Lost World, they needed to get the train back on the rails, and I think this movie accomplished that. Of course, none of the sequels are great, but that\u2019s because Jurassic Park isn\u2019t a movie that needed to be a franchise, so any sequelization is a stretch. However, if what you want from one of these films is some good dinosaur-vs-human action, then I think this movie delivers. Jurassic Park III gives good motivation for why these people are going to the island, and gets Sam Neill back into the franchise in a way that makes sense. I like that he never fully changed his ways and remains a bit of an odd individual whose devotion to his work has made it difficult to connect with people. The other characters are OK (in particular, William H. Macy who tried to do something interesting with what he was given,) but most of them are just there to scream, run for their lives, and maybe get eaten. I\u2019m desperately waiting for the first Jurassic Park movie that doesn\u2019t feel the need to shove kids into it, because they are always the worst aspect of these films. This was the closest we come, because about half the film has no sign of a child. Sure enough, the movie does get a bit more ridiculous and stupid once the boy arrives, but he doesn\u2019t do as much to make it annoying as others have in this series (at least he does no gymnastics.) The weakest aspect of Jurassic Park III is probably the CGI and practical effects. They don\u2019t look quite right, and lack the authentic appearance that Spielberg pulled off in the first film. It seems that Joe Johnston also wanted to play around with color a bit more in this film, so there\u2019s a lot of variable skin colors on the dinosaurs this time, and it can make them look artificial and cartoon-like. I can also admit that there\u2019s not a lot of great plot in this movie. Once the action gets started, there\u2019s not much more to it than running. Even so, I enjoy Jurassic Park III for what it is, and I think it holds up well.",

There is enough action, and chases to keep you intrigued. To me it has a little combination of the first two films.

But it was quite understandable since it is a good opportunity for Spinosaurus to be introduced to the world as it was recently being discovered and explored in paleontology world. But do not fret, there's still the element of suspense and thrill that we are used to Jurassic Park series especially with the Velociraptors scenes and being introduced flying Pterosaur scenes. It was nice gesture to bring Dr. Alan Grant back played again by Sam Neill and a few scenes of Dr. Ellie Sattler played again by Laura Dern to please us fans. What also makes it interesting were the additional characters are not annoying like from the previous characters of Jurassic Park 2. The story was entertaining and watchable despite there's a minor comic scene for me in the airplane crash attack scene.

            "content": "(This review contains spoilers from Jurassic Park III) \nThe Jurassic Park trilogy's ending was far less climactic then you would expect. The movie has a massive amount of wasted potential. They play with cool ideas like Dr. Allan Grant suffering from acute P.T.S.D. since his time on Isla Nublar that isn't brought back after being stranded on Isla Sorna. For some reason Billy has a 3D printer on a archeological dig site, and prints a Velociraptor larynx. Apparently the bones not only allow you to recreate a  larynx, but when you blow through it you can perfectly replicate all the subtleties and complexities of the Velociraptors speech. Allan defies his fear of the island after accepting a deal from Paul & Amanda Kirby. The Kirby's have offered him an obscene amount of money to fund his dig in exchange for his visual guide services from the safety of an airplane. Allan jumps on the opportunity without doing any investigation into the people he's meeting with, waiting for the check to clear, or telling anyone where he's going. After landing on the island against his will, Allan discovers that the Kirbys are actually looking for their son Erik who's been stranded. The parents loose their nerve and drive to find their son instantly after hearing some trees snap, and attempt to make a narrow escape only to hit a dinosaur. We are then treated to the best scene in the movie where the Spinosaurus is attacking the plane from the POV of the people inside. They leave the plane and run into a Tyrannosaurus eating. A fight ensues between the two colossal dinosaurs in which the Spinosaurus Egypticus reigns supreme, further establishing that it is an even bigger threat then the T-Rex. After getting to safety they debate splitting up like a Scooby-Doo gang. They then travel the woods and find some eggs in a nest out in the open, not hidden and unguarded waiting to be stepped on by one of the larger dinosaurs on the island. They then go into a building where they find a bunch of weird tubes with dinosaurs in them. While Mrs. Kirby is inspecting one that she apparently believes is a floating bust of a raptors head and upper shoulders when she sees it blink. We then get a decent scene of them fending off the raptor, at the end of which Allan pulls a Dr. Doolittle and manages to understand the distinction of a raptor attempting to call for help. After getting separated from the group Allan finds Erik, who has managed to survived. The Velociraptors somehow have not attempted to hunt him down like every other human they've encountered in the first to films. They havn't figured out how to get to him despite the original movies efforts to show the intelligence of these creatures. They havn't set up a trap for the kid like they show with Udesky. The Compsognathuses havn't followed and outnumbered him like they do to Dieter in Lost World. All of these amazing feats have been achieved because Erik has managed to live long enough after being marooned on the island to find, identify, bottle, and then strategically use Tyrannosaurus urine. He has been sustaining himself off a bounty of junk food he's found in a crashed vehicle in the middle of the woods. He recognizes Allan immediately and says that he's read both his and Malcolm's books. The character never does anything in the movie to show that this kid apparently is such a big fan of archeology that he's taken to reading science books far beyond his educational level.  After wondering the woods with Dr. Grant, Erik hears the ringtone from his father's phone. He begins running through the woods screaming. His parents hear him and run through the woods to find him. They reunite and Erik's dad tells him his phone was on Nash when he was eaten by the Spinosaurus during the plane attack. They then turn around to see the Spinosaurus who has managed to sneak up on them through trees without cracking them like it did at the beginning of the film. They at this point hear the phone going off... in its stomach... from across the field. They then manage to outrun the Spinosaurus and escape into a very tiny building that it could seemingly destroy. Allan then finds out Billy took Raptor eggs to help fund the dig, and says that the Raptors have been following them to get the eggs back. After that we get the best segment of the movie ; The Pteranodon cage. Eric gets snatched and taken to the babies where they begin to try and pick him apart. Billy uses the salvaged parachute he took from the crash site to swoop down and help Eric, but ends up getting swept down the river. They find a boat and start traveling down the river. They then again hear the phone ringing from the inside of a pile of feces on the shore, which has apparently survived the full digestive tract of the Spinosaurus despite it being meant to dissolve bones. They are approached by a Ceratosaurus which looked awesome, and are immediately left alone because they smell despite the Ceratosaurus being able to clearly see they are prey animals. Then they get back on the boat and the Spinosaurus, (which could apparently swim) attacks the boat and begins to sink it. We then get some really metal shots of them almost drowning while Allan calls Ellie for help, and the Spinosaurus in a lake of fire. After escaping they come into a clearing and are ambushed by the Velociraptors, which decide not to kill them and search them for the eggs. One of them nuzzles Mrs. Kirby and Allan of course is immediately able to interpret the raptors behavior for the third time in the film, and says that it thinks she has the eggs. She gives them back and Allan uses his Raptor wisperer powers. These intelligent animals have absolutely no concept of the way sound travels because they can't tell the difference between something far off in the woods where they run off to, or literally right in front of them. They then here a person through the clearing and run out onto the shore, where there is a man standing alone with a megaphone. Then Navy and the Marines, who were both waiting in underwater tanks for the guy with the megaphone to I guess swim to shore and investigate on his lonesome come onto the beach. Ellie convinced both the Navy and the Marines to come although the government previously refused to send help for Eric, and told the Kirbys to \"accept the inevitable.\" Then they get on a helicopter to find Billy, who's been found already. Billy then gives Allan back his hat, and then they all look out the window and see a flock of Pteranodons which doesn't seem to concern them in the slightest. Roll to credits\u2026 \nThe majority of the qualms I have with this film I acquired re-watching the movie as an adult. I believe this movie is still great to show your kids, and that they will have just as fun of an experience watching it as the first one. For me, not so much. One of the movies biggest flaws was that William H. Macy &  T\u00e9a Leoni were extremely annoying. They are constantly going on about their marriage problems no one cares about, and their relationship we're supposed to care about wasn't believable at all when they eventually work their problems out. The reason the movie ultimately fails is because of its overuse of CGI over practical effects, and its lack of respect for how grounded in realism the first two movies were. Looking back it's no wonder why Steven Spielberg didn't want anything to do with this movie.",

Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the characters. Also, Jurassic Park III lacks a legitimate climax - it sort of ends with a big, deus ex machina bang. This is in keeping with the film's overall poor structure. It doesn't have much of a beginning, a middle, or an ending. The movie vainly attempts to replicate the human relationships of the first two movies: a low-key romance between two adults (Grant and Sattler in Jurassic Park; Jeff Goldblum's Ian Malcolm and Julianne Moore's Sarah Harding in The Lost World) and a adult/child bonding (Grant and Hammond's grandchildren in Jurassic Park; Malcolm and his daughter in The Lost World) but fails because the characters are so thinly written.",

I mean one minute there's one man stood on a beach, the next there's half the US Navy. The action sequences are stupid, and they should have all died multiple times. At one point, instead of running from the danger, Dr. Alan Grant stands there in awe that raptors can communicate with each other... How surprising that animals communicate. Later on the raptors just stand in a circle rather than killing the people in front of them, and yet earlier they were trying to kill the characters. The raptor voice box tactic also makes no sense as it was used in front of them, so why would the raptors run off in a different direction? There are so many flawed plot points and when you compare this film to the original it is tragic. The visual effects aren't even as good as in the previous films as there seemed to be a greater reliance on CGI. Finally, the cinematography was bland, and the soundtrack wasn't as impressive.

            "content": "From two Michael Crichton's novels of Jurassic Park, Steven Spielberg decide to make those two movies based on his novels as if which are really fantastic. But now then that Joe Johnston had got the chance to direct Jurassic Park III, people had lost interest in this one. Okay, I'll get to that later. The third novel has not published and the filmmakers are going to do the film in a new way imaginable but the audience didn't like the film as a whole. Sam Neill is back as Alan Grant and this time he's been tricked by a divorced couple who wanted to find his son who is lost at Isla Sorna. What can I say about the third film? All I can say is the best thing about it is the Spinosaurus. I enjoyed the scenes with it like the first scene it attacks the Alan Grant and the others while destroying the plane and fighting the T-Rex and p***ing the audiences off with it by killing it. The story is very basic, it's really all about finding the divorced husband and wife's son and getting out of this place and that's really about it. Other people would think that the story is s**t when they first watched it and others have already seen it knows it's s**t, including my sister. It's really cheesy, I gotta tell ya. There are moments that don't really make sense like when Alan and the others hearing the satellite phone and the divorced couple had found their son and while they're heard the phone, they know it's the Spinosaurus. The phone is inside it's stomach. It's so f**king stupid! And there's another one where the Alan and the others heard the satellite phone again, it was in the Spinosaurus's s**t after it swallowed it and then s**ting it out. F**k me! And now let's get to the good stupid things about this movie. When Alan Grant is asleep, he's dreaming about a plane with no one in it and no one riding it and then the raptor is on it and saying his name going \"Alan.\" but you know it's only Alessandro Nivola's voice when he's waking him up. And now the ending where Alan Grant and the others are rescued by the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Navy and all of the sudden, Billy played by Alessandro Nivola who is known for his first film debut, Face/Off is still alive and injured after being attacked by the Pteranodons. I can how people are going through this experience with flaws that don't any goddamn sense and I think The Lost World: Jurassic Park is not as dumb as the third but the third had some stupid moments. I can only think that they're making a Jurassic World 3 with the same plot but didn't put any stupid moments in this. I hope. The CGI and special effects still look good to look at. It would have been fantastic if you're looking at the bonus features of how they made it. Jurassic Park III is not as good as the other two films, however I don't mind this one at all despite some silly moments in this, I still enjoyed the action sequences with the dinosaurs. This actually killed the franchise until Jurassic World came on screen which I will get to later but from now on, Jurassic Park III is a decent flick to look at and it is what it is for the most part.",

The natural green environment makes for a beautiful backdrop to Jurassic Park III. The CGI is better than The Lost World, but worse than Jurassic Park while all 3 look dated. In regards to the practical effects, Jurassic Park III is closer to the original.\n\nWhile Johnston better utilizes John Williams' Jurassic Park theme, the rest of the score is rather unremarkable. At least, we get a few magical moments that are still awe inspiring dinosaur reveals and scares. The jab at Spielberg's T-Rex in the start is shocking, cool, and ultimately lackluster as this group of heroes encounters much of the same scenarios as the first Jurassic Park does.\n\nHowever, there are some new elements to Jurassic Park III. Sam Neill's return is appreciated as he brings a much needed authenticity back to the franchise. William H. Macy is great for comedic relief. I also liked Alessandro Nivola's performance as Billy to add some heart. The birdcage set piece is neat especially surrounded by fog. Johnston certainly goes back to the science fiction genre with survival horror elements like the original Jurassic Park. \n\nOverall, Jurassic Park III is better than The Lost World, but never reaches the heights of Jurassic Park.",

As you guys may know, I loved the first Jurassic Park film I thought it was an excellent movie that was truly a masterpiece. The second film however was not a good movie, but it was a fun and enjoyable movie. But this movie, Jurassic Park III was terrible from start to finish. There was almost nothing in this movie that was at least decent everything was horrible. The acting was bad especially the acting by T\u00e9a Leoni. She was so dumb in this movie. The only actor who is good in his role is Sam Neil from the original Jurassic Park he\u2019s the only actor who is good. The directing by Joe Johnston is atrocious, and seeing his directing for his movie, I had a feeling while watching this movie that Marvel Studios really did not have any hopes for a good Captain America film because Joe Johnston was the director of Captain America: The First Avenger, but thankfully he did a good job with that movie. The CGI and special/visual effects are SO outdated, and really bad. Easily the worst CGI in a Jurassic Park Movie. The story itself is not so great. Just this whole movie is horrible. Nothing is right with this movie, the only thing that is good is like I said before Sam Neil but that\u2019s it. Afterwards, Jurassic Park III was a really bad movie.",

The special effects flow somewhat better than the last film, but none of the set pieces have the same visual flair as the first two movies.

It is an accomplished and entertaining film and does not overstay its welcome.In the hands of the capable but by no means Spielbergian director Joe Johnson, this JJ creates a tense, believable suspense thriller with the added benefit of dinosaurs.The special effects are up to par and still look amazing.\n\nThe story is slight. Sam Neil reprises his role of Dr. Grant, now minus his beautiful assistant Laura Dern, He once again gets hoodwinked into going into dino land for some filthy lucre promised by the power couple of William H. Macy (excellent as always) and Tea Leoni. After lying to him about their reason for dragging him down to islands off Costa Rica, they set out on an incredible journey to find their son, who is wandering around the island after being stranded in a hand gliding incident with his step father Ben. As the party of minor characters get served up and eaten as dino food, we go from one crisis to the next and one dino species to the next. There are no other villains in this particular romp but the monsters play the role admirably. Of course it is  incredible, but that's what you pay to see. Incredible monsters, looking real.\n\nWhile all of the key suspense scenes are well handled, they all end incredibly. If I ever go anywhere I want to take Sam Neil with me because when anything really bad happens, he is always rescued whether its from a group of hungry raptors, swooping pterodactyls or a huge T Rex.\n\nAll in all, it is very diverting if not much different, but that's what sequels like this provide. You go into the theatre knowing what you're going to get and either you get it or you don't. In this case, you get it right on the nose.",

Young, Laura Dern, Taylor Nichols, Mark Harelik, Julio Oscar Mechoso, and Sarah Danielle Madison\nDirected By: Joe Johnston\nReview\nThis time, it's not just a walk in the park!\nYou know a lot of Jurassic Park fans hate this entire in the series for many reasons and most I do understand but heres the thing, the second film is much worse and I actually like this one.\nIn need of funds for research, Dr. Alan Grant accepts a large sum of money to accompany Paul and Amanda Kirby on an aerial tour of the infamous Isla Sorna. It isn't long before all hell breaks loose and the stranded wayfarers must fight for survival as a host of new -- and even more deadly -- dinosaurs try to make snacks of them.\nThe movie was trying to be a serviceable fun sequel that was more traditional the book titled The Lost World unlike the last film. It had the raptors being able to communicate with each other, the parachute scene so as to why people say this worst then the second is very insulting.\nThe story is not Oscar worth, its not complex one either it's just a fun rescue mission. That's good it's plain and simple and makes for a fun film. The performances now, that's the bad part I mean most of the cast do fine I just didn't like the guy who played Billy( the guy in the parachute in the end I think that's what his name was) and the mother, she was really annoying. Joe Johnston has actually given me four movies I fairly enjoy and one that I love(Captain America: The First Avenger) the other films Honey I shrunk The Kids, Jumanji, and I do really like The Wolfman remake with Anthony Hopkins I think it's a very good and fun remake. He does a good job here as well.\nConsidering how much people hate this film I guess I'll say I hate myself for liking this movie and so I'm giving Jurassic Park III a three out of five.",

These movies have always been about the thrills more than the characters. The Lost World fought that and pandered too strongly to children, but this movie finds a reasonable balance. Early in the movie Dr. Grant from the first film remerges and needing money to continue his research. A newlywed couple wanting a guided air tour of the island bribes him into returning to the place that still gives him nightmares. The unimpressive story just serves as a lose framework to get people back onto the island of dinosaurs. The couple played by William H Macy and Tia Leoni feel forced. They are both good actors, but most of the time they just to run and scream. The special effects improve once again. Computer graphics made an enormous leap since the second movie, and it shows here. The motions of the animals are smooth and more bird-like, reflecting the evolving theories of the extinct animals. This movie features exciting airborne dinosaurs that are the best part of the movie. It introduces the Spinosaurus, which was an even larger predatorily dinosaur with more teeth than the Tyrannosaurus Rex. I wish more informative tidbits wove into the dialogue like the first movie, but these new creatures emerge without much time for explanation. Having the paleontology leader of the group sprinkle in more theories and information along the way makes the creatures more impressive. At least they do this some with Dr. Grant's fascination of how Raptors might have communicated with each other, but I want more of this. It is enjoyable entertainment, despite its lack of depth.",

Also making Grant and Ellie not be together in the end completely destroys the love story in Jurassic Park because every time anyone watches Jurassic Park now we already know that they don't end up together for no reason. The dinosaurs were cool to see again even though a lot of the cgi and animatronics pail in comparison to Jurassic Park and Lost World and the fight between Spinosaurus and T-rex is a bit underwhelming and should have been saved for the end.

Why?!? It just doesn't make sense.  But the Pterodactyl's were fun.  I liked the main cast, although the kid who played Erik left a little to be desired.  I also felt like it didn't really conclude the trilogy all that well. There was no real closer - just another movie about another encounter with the dinosaurs.  Also, there was so much with Sam's relationship to Ellie Satler - and then when you think they are going to follow up on that...the movie just ends.  \"But it was better than the previous one\" is pretty much sums this movie up.",

The plot to the movie is that two parents loose their child during a parachuting accident and the boy is on an island and they get \"Alan Grant\" portrayed by \"Sam Neill\" to help find this boy. The plot to the movie is okay, but this takes up only takes up 20 minutes of the movie, the rest is just people walking around the island. Also referred to as filler. The first scene in the movie makes no sense and is never explained in the movie. The most of the movie is boring. The end scene is horrible, it's supposed to look like a happy ending but it doesn't make sense.  The acting in this movie is okay; it's nothing too special. \"T\u00e8a Leoni\" is unlikeable. For example there is a scene where a dead body is found \"T\u00e8a Leoni's\" character just won't stop screaming after she's sees the body. In fact there is really no character except for \"Sam Neill\" who is enjoyable to watch.  The music in this movie is okay; there were only one or two scenes that the music was used well. The special effects in this movie are bad the C.G.I. is extremely noticeable. The action scenes in this movie are neither thrilling nor entertaining in any way at all. Some action scenes are laughably bad. The way the movie is filmed is bad. The scene where the dinosaur attacks the plane the editing is so bad it's hard to tell what's happening at all. If you are a person who enjoyed the first \"Jurassic Park\" then I recommend you don't watch \"Jurassic Park III\". \"Jurassic Park III\" has many problems green screen being noticeable, bad C.G.I., boring characters and some dumb action scenes. I give \"Jurassic Park III\" a 4/10.",

During my childhood it was nothing more perilous than a Saturday afternoon showing of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. Around the turn of this century it seems the thrill of the day became illegal paragliding off quarantined islands.

Yeah we do. We also remember the sorry Jeff Goldblum vehicle that followed so don't get cocky. \n \nJP3 begins with the same thin setup as the previous sequel. Sam Neill publicly swears never to go to the island, then immediately goes to the island, then becomes trapped on the island. The filmmakers wisely introduce an exciting dinosaur fight and chase at this point and, while I hate to admit it, all is forgiven.\n \nWe continue exploring Isla Sorna (again) as Tea Leoni and William H. Mustache search for their marooned son and rediscover a lost romance in the process. I'd imagine if they couldn't handle marriage in rural Oklahoma that being stuck on the most dangerous safari ever wouldn't help them patch things up. \n \nMuch like The Lost World this film moves the audience quickly between recurrent action sequences without any suspense or guess work involved. There are also considerable improvements; the dinosaur effects look much better than the last film and the actors bring some feeling of joy to the screen. Tea Leoni basically got paid to yell and run around a lot but it was better than Julianne Moore delivering every line as if she were reading a medical pamphlet.\n \nThere are no surprises here but a few thrilling action scenes that are worth your time. Jurassic Park 3 is a lather, rinse, repeat type of film but I walked away feeling cleaner than the last outing.",

The movie is also much darker than the first two which makes it a little more scary and entertaining but at the same time, there are just some bad things that bring the movie down. One bad thing is that there are too many things that don't make sense at all and some parts are just so boring. The movie's suspense isn't very good like the first two which can ruin the scary parts.

While there are a good amount of elements I disliked in this film, I thought I was going to enjoy it even less than I did. I set my expectations super low for a film I vaguely remember seeing around the time it was released, which means I haven't seen the film in roughly 14 years.\n\nJust like in The Lost World, I can't believe how idiotic some of the characters were in this film. In The Lost World it was the old man who was extremely dumb sending people into danger again after being responsible for the tragedy at Jurassic Park, and now Kirby is the idiot for tricking Dr. Grant and his sidekick Billy into helping him rescue his son on the second island on which InGen was creating dinosaurs. It is brave of him as a father, but all the arrangements he made were stupid - Dr. Grant is a dinosaur expert, not the head of a rescue squad, the \"mercenaries\" Kirby hired weren't really mercenaries, and of course everybody except Grant, Kirby and his family, and Billy, are killed.\n\nWhat doesn't make too much sense is that Kirby couldn't convince the U.S. embassy to help rescue his son, yet Ellie (Laura Dern) is able to convince the navy and marines to rescue Grant and everyone still alive on the island after one phone call from Grant.\n\nThis movie reminds me of a shorter version of Saving Private Ryan in a way, but these people are risking their lives for one boy, not one soldier, which creates a different emotional connection than Saving Private Ryan.\n\nThe quality of the film just doesn't seem to match up to the original 2 - the CGI is overused in this one and looks worse than the CGI of the first 2, and the robotic dinosaurs are utilized less, which kind of breaks the illusion of the movie. The writing is bad (by the way, what was Alexander Payne doing co-writing this movie? that was a strange credit to see) with dialogue about \"driving 5 miles under the speed limit\" intending to be meaningful (I'm not joking, it's that bad) and we lack dialogue as well as the theme of the ethics of recreating dinosaurs overall except for one instance when Grant says \"this is playing God,\" referring to what InGen was doing.\n\nThe movie held my interest at times, but it was a fairly bad 3rd installment for this movie franchise. Let's see if Jurassic World starring Chris Pratt will surprise me.",

            "content": "Jurassic Park III is an ok sequel that is still entertaining despite its flaws and being considered by critics as the weakest installment in the Jurassic Park series. This movie takes place four years after the events of The Lost World Jurassic Park where Dr. Alan Grant the survivor of the events from the first film is now living a peaceful life with a friend. But soon a young couple starts to convince him and his friend about visiting Isla Sorna where they're son has gone missing and as Alan Grant enters Isla Sorna with his friend and the couple, they are soon being hunted down by the dinosaurs that lurk in that area and Alan Grant must help the couple find their son and escape Isla Sorna as the dinosaurs start to hunt for them. Ok Jurassic Park III is an ok sequel more or less and despite that The Lost World Jurassic Park and this sequel suffers from a series of issues and flaws, the trilogy is entertaining to say the least. Ok let's get on with the review. Now like I said Jurassic Park III is an ok sequel despite everything what I said about it, and I know it is the weakest installment in the series but the film still has loads of impressive things that still made this movie a big hit. The good things about Jurassic Park III is that the movie is faster on pacing than its predecessors, the movie itself is quick and fast on pacing from start to finish and I think Joe Johnston did a cool job on how he made this film faster and quicker than the first two and there are no dull moments in several scenes of the film and it gives the film a good feel. The other highlights of this movie is the film's atmosphere and I love the use of thick fog in a couple of scenes in the film and it gives the film an organic feeling on both the outside and inside plus there are a couple of cool scenes in the film like the crazy Raptor sequence, Spinosaurus vs T-Rex and the intense Pterodactyl scene in the cage. But the film's true highlight is always the dinosaurs and the special effects used in the movie. I love how from the first film until this film the CGI and animatronics go to a completely amazing direction. And the boundaries on using CGI is seriously at the top. And the dinosaurs themselves look really neat and cool. Almost every dinosaur looks extremely realistic from start to finish and I would definitely say that the Jurassic Park films are one of the best movies in using special effects since the Poltergeist movies. Now the film seriously miss the spot and the film suffers from a series of flaws and there are more of it over its predecessor. One of the things I did not like about this movie is the film's weak plot, and seriously the movie suffers from a really weak plot thanks to the script the film could have been better if it weren't for the issues on the screenplay. The other things I didn't like about this film is that the movie lacks the sensitivity of the original but the worst thing about this movie is the soundtrack and I can't imagine why John Williams was replaced by a new composer and honest the soundtrack for this movie is nowhere as good as the ones that John Williams composed for the first two films. Ok now the acting for me is a hit and miss. The Only actors who I can praise for this movie is Sam Neill and Laura Dern who reprise their roles from the first film as Alan Grant and Ellie respectively. From the new casts only William H. Macy delivers an amazing performance while actress Tea Leoni delivers the worst and the most irritating performances on screen ever and hearing her shout is bad for the ears and her character was also a bit annoying in a couple of scenes. Director Joe Johnston did an ok job with his work on this movie and I think this is by far his weakest film to date compared to his other films over the years. And I think Joe Johnston couldn't understand the look of this film and the way he executed it was pretty bad but at least he knows how to handle everything in this movie even though Director Steven Spielberg and screenwriter David Koepp were not involve in making this film since Spielberg is executive producer on this film. Overall Jurassic Park III is an ok sequel and despite its flaws it is still an enjoyable film. This movie gets a 6/10.",

I'll gladly take this over the overly okay Lost World and the massive train wreck of terrible effects and writing known as Jurassic World.\n\nSo, if you're like me and you've heard nothing but bad things about this movie and curious to check it out, I'd say, find a decent copy online and give it a watch if ya have some time ya want to kill.\n\nNot a good movie.....but a better one than it could have been and a lot better than people give it credit for...",

What I liked about this is that it's short unlike The Lost World where that's 2 hours and 10 minutes and this is just an hour and a half. So even if you don't like it it's not that long. Story for this is dumb but it doesn't really matter that much because again this is a lot more enjoyable than The Lost World. William H. Macy's wife in this bugged me, all she did was scream.

The whole scene in the aviary is very unique and fun to watch as is are the many velociraptor scenes which is better than the boring dinosaur walk through in the lost world.

It's certainly the flimsiest plot in the series, but it is more simple than the previous installment. We don't get any bad company men or militarized forces. Instead, we get a stripped down cast of characters, which is nice. However, the film does feel the need to go bigger and better than before, so instead of any form of plot development other than escape, we basically follow these characters as they run from one set piece to the next. This isn't a horrible thing, as the set pieces are quite thrilling, but like I said, a thicker plot would've been nice. What is nice is that the film stops to have character development, but only when it comes naturally. That's a rarity in most cases with these films, as it is usually shoehorned in for the sake of it. Effects wise, the visual effects are significantly better than before, and there seems to be a lot more practical effects this time than in the previous installment, which is always welcome. As for the acting, everyone does fine and holds their own, with the exception of Alessandro Nivola as Billy, who is just really bad and grating. You almost wish something bad would happen to him. By the time the film ends, the viewer is left with a capper to a trilogy that couldn't quite hold up the legacy of the original, and it would stay that way for another fourteen years.",

However, I still enjoy it as a fun timewaster.  It's a guilty pleasure for sure.\nThe plot is super simple.  A kid named Eric goes parasailing with a friend near Site B from The Lost World which is still inhabited by dinosaurs.  They end up getting stranded there and Eric's parents Paul (William H. Macy) and Amanda (Tea Leoni), gather a rescue team to find him.  Among the rescue team unknowingly are Dr. Grant (Sam Neil) and his partner Billy.  They themselves get stranded and now must find Eric and get off the island while running from dinosaurs who want to eat them.\nThe main reason I enjoy this film is because Sam Neil returns as Dr. Grant who is my favorite character of the franchise.  Sam Neil I find to be one of the most underrated actors at least in American cinema.  It's a shame he doesn't get more work as he's one of my favorite actors. \nThe rest of the cast is pretty subpar.  This film probably sports the weakest cast of all the movies though Jurassic World comes at a close second.  The best character, by far, is Dr. Grant but he can't save the cast.  The only other notable characters here are Billy and Eric.  William H. Macy does a good job with what he has.  His character is really nothing but he has some entertaining bits.\nThe film looks good.  The effects are below the first two given that they got a different effects team but they're still pretty for the most part.  Though, some effects do look pretty dated like some of the animatronic effects for the Spinosaurus.  Besides that the setting and sets still look great and builds atmosphere.\nAbove all I found the film entertaining.  If you want a more philosophical film that the first two films had with the message of man tampering with nature then you won't find it here.  They through all that out in favor of just having a straightforward and entertaining survival flick.  For me it was fun despite some annoying characters, dumb plot threads, and a laundry list of things that make zero sense.\nOverall, I can see why so many hate this film.  I know it isn't good.  However, I enjoy it as a fun monster b-movie.  If you just want an entertaining monster movie to watch then you can give this look.  If you want something like the first two films than you will be disappointed.",

Don Davis music is really good, and it does have some of that \"Jurassic Park\" feeling. Joe Johnston's direction is okay, but just keeps missing on the boat. The special effects are similar to the second film, where some parts are dated as the rest are mostly good. Also, I which if this movie wasn't an hour in a half long so it can be more of a two hour adventure like the other films were. It is not the worst film of the series, but it is the weakest and I can watch it as a time waster. An okay movie, but definitely one of the weakest of the bunch.",

The script is much less convoluted than its predecessor and it's full of quotable lines. \n\nThere is a brilliant scene involving pterodactyls--which may very well be the highlight of the entire film, and one of the best scenes from the trilogy.\n\nJurassic Park III retains the mystery and surprise that has been so key to making this series enjoyable. And I've said it before, but John Williams' score is so fantastic. I get chills every time I hear that motif. The music provides such a peaceful contrast to the thrilling suspense going on at the same time--helping to underline the magnificence of these dinosaurs regardless of the specific circumstances that these characters have found themselves in.\n\nThe only thing that keeps me scratching my head is how the effects team can make these dinosaurs look so impressive, yet they can't perfect the green screen technology.\n\nEither way, this is a perfect denouement to a brilliant trilogy.\n\nTwizard Rating: 96",

Alan Grant has now gained notoriety for the events on John Hammond's island, which was made worse by the San Diego incident in The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997), but is largely ignored when it comes to actual dinosaur research, while Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) has now married a completely random character, and she returns in a smaller capacity merely for plot reasons later on in the movie. With his assistant Billy (Alessandro Nivola), Grant heads to Isla Sorna with the Kirby couple and, naturally, encounters trouble.\n\nIt's rather run-of-the-mill at this point; people go to one of the two dinosaur islands and bad things happen. While the first movie stuck fairly close to this survival formula, it was aided by amazing writing and equally amazing characters that did their parts in keeping the movie exciting, thrilling and fast paced. The formula began its wear and tear in The Lost World: Jurassic Park, as the amazing set of characters were replaced with lacklustre characters - except Ian Malcolm - and generally wore the structure thin. In Jurassic Park III, director Joe Johnston and the three writers are all just standing around with fossilized dinosaur bones and taking turns beating the formula into the same consistency as a steaming pile of T-Rex turd. Thankfully, Sam Neill is here to save the day as Dr. Alan Grant... and just like Jeff Goldblum's Ian Malcolm in the previous movie, the character's only function is as an exposition tool for the blandly written Kirby family and to the audience for the great looking dinosaurs that grace the screen.\n\nSince the infamous Velociraptors were largely underdeveloped in The Lost World: Jurassic Park, the presence of Grant in Jurassic Park III gives the species a shot at salvation, as the good palaeontologist more than willingly explains how the raptors are much more intelligent than originally believed. This gives a much needed depth and room to expand the formidable and agile dinosaurs, whilst effectively elevating them to the same threat level as the badass Spinosaurus - supposedly the largest of all known carnivorous dinosaurs -, which stalks Grant and the group throughout Jurassic Park III. Where the directing and script falls short immensely, Sam Neill's performance as Alan Grant and the menacing as never before dinosaurs help to sustain Jurassic Park III's mediocrity.",

So Dr. Grant (Sam Neill) has moved on since the events that occurred on Isla Nublar, and has vowed to never return, given that he's having PTSD flashbacks and all.  Little does he know that two parents (William H. Macy, T\u00e9a Leoni) have a ruse in store for him, as they will stop at nothing to recover their lost son who was last seen near the island.  Is there anybody out there that doesn't love dinosaurs, or at the very least think they are cool?  They are such awe-inspiring creatures that are so proportionately large, it boggles the mind to picture them roaming the Earth.  Jurassic Park III adds even more dinos to the mix, boasting beasts that put the T-Rex to shame.  This was the final preparation I had to make to ready myself for the Jurassic World release, having just received my first exposure to the second film, and having watched the original for the umpteenth time.  Jurassic Park III is not as good as the first one, but I think that goes without saying; if you were expecting something as great as the groundbreaking original, you're just being foolish.  I do think this is right on par with the second, though.  The Lost World has a better craft to it, and it is understandable why that is the case; it's still Steven Spielberg, who obviously has a leg up on technique and knowhow.  However, its biggest shortcoming was the story itself, as it tries so hard to ape the first one.  Where I appreciate Jurassic Park III is that it has the gall to try something different, and this installment pretty much can stand on its own.  There is much more comedy involved, which may turn some people off, but I welcomed it.  One thing I do also give the film credit for is that it feels like there is a dinosaur around every corner, and with new breeds that we've never seen before, it does add tension.  It's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, though, and the writing is probably the sloppiest of the series; everybody knows what they are getting into, so there's really not that A-grade level of effort placed forth.  Even though that does fall short, it wins you back with how abbreviated it is; it is the shortest film in the series by over 30 minutes, so it's already wrapping up before you have the opportunity to truly start to criticize it.

It seems like the only reason it's here is to show us death scenes and plot twists. The good news is, most action/adventure fans will love it, especially survival lovers. \nWhile I am not a fan of this third installment, I am proud of one thing. The naturalistic view of things. We get to see the pterodactyls fly in the air, herbivores eating in the sun, and even a dinosaur fight. Because of this, we feel like we are on a real dinosaur island. In fact, more like in the Jurassic Period. The first two films had these elements, but not as obvious and as well put as Jurassic Park III.\nWhile the film has good moments, it has flat out stupid ones. Prepare for spoilers. There is a scene where Alan Grant has a brief nightmare while sleeping in a plane ride. In the nightmare, he dreams of the pilots being gone, and the plane is crashing. Then, a Velociraptor is sitting in the seat next to him. The dinosaur literally speaks during this dream. Yeah. Should I laugh? Then, near the end of the film, we are led to believe that one of the main characters, Billy, is dead. At the final scene, he is revealed alive. The only time I've seen a moment like this work was in Jaws (1975).\nOverall, I don't like Jurassic Park III. While I was impressed with some of the visuals and dialogue, and of course, the dinosaurs, I didn't enjoy a large majority of it.",

This is very much an action-driven film, and as such, doesn't take time to focus on some of the fun, harmless dinosaurs.  The result is that \"Jurassic Park III\" lacks the fun of the original film.

He once again proves himself to be this franchise's more appealing lead over Jeff Goldblum.  The rest of the cast is under-developed and pretty expendable; I could leave 'em or take 'em.\n\nThough it does not quite reach the level of its classic predecessor, \"Jurassic Park III\" still manages to create plenty of scares and suspense.  No matter how many Jurassic Park films they make, one fact will always remain true; watching dinosaurs chase people never gets old.",

I think Jurassic Park 3 is highly underrated. I wouldn't call it good but it's not that bad. It's ok. The positives are the Spinosaurus, Allen Grant, the really smart Velociraptors, the T-rex, and the special effects. The Spinosaurus was really cool. In the movie and in real life it is much bigger than the overrated Tyrannosaurus. It can also swim and use its arms. Allen is really cool because you feel bad for him. He was lied to by Mr. and Mrs. Kirby so that he would be on the island to help find their son and he doesn't want to be there. The Velociraptors are smarter in JP3. They communicate more and strategize. It's very cool. I like that the T-rex was more of a cameo. It was featured in almost every movie with dinosaurs in the 20th century so it needed a brake. This also lead to a cool fight scene between it and Spinosaurus. And while the special effects aren't as good as the last 2, some parts are very well made. Now there are also definitely some negatives. Some of the acting can be stale at times, the story is very basic, there are some plot holes, and there aren't any big scenes with herbivores. Herbivores are shown but not in the spectacular sense that you get from the scene from the first one with Brachiosaurus walking in the big field. But on the other hand the movie never gets slow because there's always action on the screen. So I think it's ok and very underrated.",

At least this one is fun at times, the deaths are pretty brutal (and occur on screen), and the film actually has a good sense of adventure as well. It's good to see Laura Dern and Sam Neill return, and newcomer Trevor Morgan as Eric is actually pretty good. The rest of the characters are kind of bland, but are still likable.

Except this time only three people are killed, and all within twenty minutes of each other.  The rest is just a formulaic meditation on how much better things could have been.  It does have its moments though, and while Joe Johnston is certainly no Spielberg, he at least turns in a decent performance at portraying the dinosaurs as magnificent but frightening creatures.

The spinosaurus makes for a great new antagonist, and gives the T-Rex more than a run for its money.\n\nNow we have Sam Neill who is a welcome return to the franchise after Jeff Goldblum's less likable more cynical turn as the hero in Lost World.  The rest of the cast are made of respectable actors who do their job well.\n\nDespite Spielberg's absence as director who still served as producer, Joe Johnston handles this sequel with assurance and almost equal skill.

            "content": "Jurassic Park 3 is regarded by many as something of a disappointment and the worst film of the Jurassic Park franchise. But personally I think it receives too much negative criticism and is a definite improvement of its predecessor The Lost World. Joe Johnston has taken over directorial duties from Steven Spielberg and I think the majority had low expectations of this film because of this. However Spielberg was still involved as an executive producer.\n\nSam Neill is back! I think this films saving grace is the return of Dr. Alan Grant. Without him it would of been a flop like The Lost World. Sam Neill does his best to bring the franchise back to life and brings back the wonder and fascination of the original. The supporting cast however is awful and on a par with The Lost World. William H. Macy is great in Fargo and Magnolia, but his inclusion in Jurassic Park 3 didn't work for me. Then there's T\u00e9a Leoni who I can't stand and other bit part characters who aren't particularly well known. I was however very pleased with Laura Dern's brief return as Dr. Ellie Sattler.\n\nThe plot is wafer thin compared to the previous films and is set on Site B, the same island as in The Lost World. It looks a feels a lot different though. The film starts where we see a man and a boy parasailing over the island coast and they're boat is attacked by something unknown. They release themselves from the boat and glide into the island. As they are missing, the parents of the boy want to go to the island to rescue their son. The parents know the island is a restricted area and that no authorities can help them. So they pose as a wealthy couple who trick Alan Grant into being a tour guide as they fly over the island. They lie about having permission from the Costa Rican government and make Alan Grant an offer he cannot refuse. The couple acquire a team of mercenary experts and with Alan Grant go on their so called tour of the island pretending that they hope to see Dinosaurs.\n\nOn their arrival to the island, as the plane circles the couple say they want to land the plane. Alan Grant protests that its too dangerous to land and before he knows it he realises he's been tricked and lied to. After a series of unfortunate events involving the plain crashing, the group is stuck on the Island and the search begins for the missing boy. And apart from mid way through when the boy is actually found, not much else happens in terms of plot other than the group gradually moving towards the coast. But despite the lack of story telling, the film is well compensated with great action sequences and more best of all more Dinosaurs.\n\nWe see the Spinosaurus for the first time and the flying Pteranodon's also. Sadly the T-Rex is killed within minutes as it epically faces off against the Spinosaurus and looses. We then see the return of the raptors and they look more real than ever. The exciting set pieces continue as we see the Pteranodon's in a huge bird cage which is visually stunning. Next the Spinosaurus returns under water and destroys a boat and a crane in the films last big set piece. Last but not least the raptors return seeking their eggs that had been stolen by one of the characters, after a terrifyingly suspenseful face off with Sam Neill the film comes to a close as the group finally reaches the coast and the Marines and Navy arrive to rescue them.\n\nJurassic Park 3 is probably the scariest and most suspenseful of the franchise, apart from the first viewing of the original Jurassic Park when we'd all seen nothing like it before. Although the plot is simple, it makes sense as apposed to the mix ups in The Lost World. The scale doesn't feel as big as the first two films, but its still thoroughly enjoyable. The set pieces are so much fun but sadly the timing if them felt a bit disjointed. The first big sequence featuring the fight between the T-Rex and Spinosaurus I think would of been great as the films ending climax. Whereas the ending just suddenly comes to a halt. At times the films lacks those trademark Spielberg moments of the first two films but personally overall is more enjoyable than The Lost World, but still doesn't come close to the original.\n\nThe score is undoubtedly fantastic again and the tone and atmosphere of the film is dark, scarier and full of suspense. The animatronics are better than ever and the special effects are the best seen in the franchise yet. Sam Neill is great again Dr. Alan Grant and saves the film of its weak story. People are too negative of Jurassic Park 3 and the Lost World, but for all of their faults, there's no denying their epic amounts of enjoyment. For as long as these films keep being made, I'll pay to watch them and enjoy them for what they are... Dinosaurs. That's the bottom line, there's no other Dinosaur films and I can't believe its 12 years and counting that we've waited for a forth instalment. Jurassic Park 4 has recently been announced and personally I cannot wait. It will be interesting to see whether they continue the story of start fresh, but either way I can't wait.",

There are more details on the dinosaurs as a result, you'll notice some of the Raptors have whiskers on their heads and new markings on most of the creatures. There's a new dinosaur to rule them all and T-Rex gets shown up just so the audience is aware of this fact. Aside from those details, the rest of the story is what you'd expect. People get picked off one-by-one until they're rescued. Unfortunately, some of the characters we'd like to see meet an early end - don't.\n\nEither way, this is an enjoyable instalment in the series and I was surprised to find out it was released in 2001.

This third instalment goes to typical sequel territory: It tries to recreate some settings/shots of the first film, it goes for the \"bigger baddy\" clich\u00e9, it brings some familiar faces back, B movie level of acting, laughable scenes (not only the infamous dream sequence), the new characters are more than forgettable and have no personality whatsoever, the special effects look extremely dated- ironic don't you think?- , Joe Johnson\u00b4s directing is as generic as always, the most ridiculous script of the entire series, the story is pretty clich\u00e9 and generic, the pacing is so fast that you will stop to remember how you ended up in a scene, and this feels like the PG version of \"Jurassic Park\" due to the lack of intense/violent sequences. To be honest, there are only three elements that elevate this film a little: Sam Neil, the Pteranodons sequence, as they were the only dinosaur that Spielberg never gave their deserved moment; and that before you know it the film is over.\n\"Jurassic Park 3\" feels like a parody of the original. As a B movie it is serviceable but as an addition to the franchise, it is unnecessary, forgettable and laughable. There goes Spielberg, there goes this franchise\u00b4s magic (will see if \"Jurassic World\" proves me wrong but I really doubt it)",

Visually, you will most certainly notice that while the special FX are far more advanced than the first movie, you'll also probably feel as I did: that it wasn't impressive and it was over-used. The film relies too heavily on special FX and it drowns out the realism from the first two. This may also have to do with the fact that the film takes place a lot of the time during the day, whereas the previous installments used a lot of night sequences. Sure, there were some pretty moments, such as the scene by the river. Nevertheless, with all these effects, you start to feel like you're watching a movie from the SyFy channel and that wasn't a good thing at all. I guess this marks the beginning of the era when filmmakers decided to get lazy and turn movies mostly into special effects extravaganzas. \n\nAdditionally, I took up issue with the dinosaurs. Yeah, they looked cooler with their hip new color patterns instead of the simple mud-brown palette they were almost unilaterally assigned in the first two. My big issue is with the velociraptors.\n\nWe've known from the very first movie that raptors are extremely intelligent, agile, and astute problem solvers which, coupled with their basic predatory instinct, easily made them the scariest foes for the humans to face. I guess without the presence of humans on this particular site for all these years, we are supposed to get the idea that the raptors have become doubly intelligent. So instead of believable animals with intelligent hunting strategies, we get creatures that feel more like reptilian mobsters. They expertly break necks and camouflage themselves as science experiments in labs (i.e., the raptor holding perfectly still behind the glass before leaping out at them.) They are so smart that the humans running from them start to look like idiots as they scream and holler for each other in the middle of the jungle, presence of man-eating dinosaurs be damned. At least with the first one you got the idea that they were really intelligent problem-solvers but they were still animals. I'm surprised they didn't bust out in mocking laughter when Grant pulled out that instrument  that could mimic their calls. You can tell this was directed by someone else. \n\nAnd while I like Dr. Grant, he's honestly kind of boring on his own. Especially since the other characters on-screen aren't very interesting themselves. The last time we saw him he was with kids and his character kind of grew from that experience and spending time with them. Here, he leaves the movie the same way he was when we first saw him. The \"evolving\" is left to the Kirby family. \n\nIn short, if you really want to enjoy this movie do your best not to think about the first two. I hope the next one is better.",

            "content": "While I can't say that this film holds a candle to the first film on a storytelling level, it's at least here to do what it's supposed to do: be a fun film. And it gets to the point pretty fast and does so in a far more effective way than The Lost World: Jurassic Park. While that film was over two hours of whining environmentalists given far too much time to shoot their mouths off, this film at least understands that it's characters are not its strong point. And therefore, it doesn't waste too much time on them.\n\nBut with that... yeah... the characters are pretty lame. There's Tea Leoni and her scream that gets pretty old pretty fast. There's Sam Neil reprising his role as the reluctant Alan Grant, who seems far too easily swayed to return to the island for cash after his spiteful statements against it in the beginning. And there's Billy, played by Alessandro Nivola. And his character seems really bland and underdeveloped.\n\nThe story has a million holes in it, too. For example: why would any parents let their twelve year old child go on a trip anywhere near an island filled with dangerous dinosaurs? Why would there still be any need for paleontological digs if we could just create dinosaurs anytime? Doesn't that seem like wasted funding? Why can the biggest baddest predator of all time (Spinosaurus) kill a t-rex in seconds, yet not be able to catch five slow moving people? It's a jarringly porous script.\n\nStill, if you can get past these things that weigh the screenplay down, there are some terrifically exciting scenes involving some seriously amped up dinosaurs. This is especially apparent in the river scene towards the end of the film. I'll be perfectly honest: it's one of the most convincing monster attacks I've ever seen in a film. And most of it is animatronics, done by the sorely missed Stan Winston. To be fair, when you only have a cast of five people for most of your movie, you can see why they'd be quick to draw out these chase scenes. Otherwise, Spiney would've been allowed to live up to a much fuller potential. And he is quite the ferocious antagonist when allowed to be.\n\nI guess what it all comes down to is that the film simply had too much promise with what it was given to work with: small cast, the loss of the original writer (Micheal Crichton) and just how much it had to live up to. But take it for what it's worth. It's short, sweet and to the point. And it at the very least can passively entertain without overstaying it's welcome. It has that over the second film, which takes too much time on very blandly written characters. The film knows it's strong points and devotes far more time to them.",
