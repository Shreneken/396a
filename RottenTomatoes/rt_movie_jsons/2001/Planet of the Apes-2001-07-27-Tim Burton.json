    "summary": "Director Tim Burton (\"Batman\") reinvents one of the most acclaimed and beloved works of science fiction, Pierre Boulle's classic novel \"Planet of the Apes.\" Burton's \"Planet of the Apes\" begins with the famed original's premise -- a pilot finds himself in a world turned upside down after landing on a strange planet.",

            "content": "I don't really know what to say about this.....this is nothing compared to the 1968 Masterpiece. The acting isn't that good surprisingly. Mark Wahlberg has no chemistry with anyone really and the villain in this isn't good and is extremely forgettable. Some of the big apes are well designed but the small chimp looking ones are stupid. The humans are extremely forgettable and have no chemistry either and almost no backstory and are the definition of one dimensional. Even the friendly girl ape who I can't even remember her name was just ok. Paul Giamatti was terrible in this and completely miscast as the comedic relief. His character should've been cut completely. The biggest shortfall here is the dialogue is NO WHERE near as compelling and riveting as the first and can be very boring at times especially the part in the first half where they all have dinner and it reminds me of Coursant in Phantom Menace. The cinematography isn't bad but is one of the most frustrating parts watching this. you can tell there is lots of effort in the ape designs, sets, lots of practical effects that are well done and SHOULD WORK but they are weighed down by the stupid chimps jumping 10 feet, stupid ape noises/expressions, and during night scenes it is way too dark lots of times. The CGI is dated and average but 85% of this is practical so it's not a big deal. The ending is also sooooo dumb and bad. The music is boring and forgettable. The editing and pacing are not good either. This is clearly trying to be a Action/Adventure movie with Sci-Fi mixed in more than the first was a clever Sci-Fi Social commentary. This has NONE of the underlying messaging or thought provoking moments the original had that sets it apart from all others. It tries to focus more on the background of the apes and their backstories and society. But the dialogue isn't as riveting, and it loses focus on the humans and at the expense of giving the apes more backstory it doesn't give the humans hardly any. Heck for 30 minutes in the first half Mark Wahlberg just disappears into the background. This is sooooo boring to watch by the second half because of the boring characters, dumb villain, miscasting's, the lack of backstory of the humans, the dumb interjected chimp fighting moments, and the worst part the stupid ending. The plot twist of the monkeys on the ship they were testing evolving into the apes makes no sense either because were never given a reason how that happened. Also are you telling me the chimp police drive Ford Crown Victoria's meant for humans and mimic the Lincoln Memorial....it's so dumb and looks bad. The whole monkey he was chasing after at the start in the ship being their god is sooooo dumb as well. It has good parts to it but just never makes it work together in a cohesive way. Just watch the 1968 one. This is a insult.",

Gotta be frustrating for all involved that they were in a remake/reboot of 1968's 'Planet of the Apes' that wasn't the 2011 version. This one walked so that one could fly etc.\n\nSpeaking of flying, what the heck is with the high jumping apes in this? It looks so silly and doesn't add anything; a very odd choice. It is, though, a surprise that this film flopped given who got attached to it. Tim Burton as director, with the acting talents of Mark Wahlberg, Tim Roth, Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Clarke Duncan and Paul Giamatti. It's neat that Charlton Heston and Linda Harrison (stars of the original) made cameos, though.\n\nWahlberg feels a bit miscast, though Bonham Carter and Giamatti are solid; the latter particularly seemed to enjoy the role. The film does have a Burton edge to it, as expected, but this is one of his weaker films no doubt. Some other negatives, for me, include the make-up, esp. for General Thade, - I'm in the minority there - and the story's pacing.",

Mark Wahlberg does ok somewhat likeable but mostly bland which makes it hard to buy since he is the main hero.Tim Roth does a great performance as the antagonist Thade an ape general covered in terrifying makeup. Helena Bonham Carte also does a warm and powerful performance as a female ape who sides with Mark's character. The most disappointing is to see Estella warren in a character that does nothing other than look pretty and an ending that is clearly egregius in light of the original.",

The plot was confusing only in that it was illogical for the main spaceship not to have been pulled forward in time when the same electrical storm worked to send Wahlberg back where he came from.

The story is the same as the original, but this time, the humans can talk in this one. The ape that he sent in his timeline, turns out to be the king or the ruler of the planet, where they respected him. After the battle ended to where they accepted the humans, the man goes back to his timeline. This got confusing. General Thade is an ape that wanted to kill the man when he was there. After he came back to his timeline, he looks up at what appears to be the Lincoln Memorial, only to find that it is now a monument to General Thade, who had later escaped, also traveled back in time through the same electromagnetic storm and conquered humanity. Leo is descended upon by a swarm of police officers, firefighters, and news reporters, all of whom are apes. It seems they wanted to make a sequel of this, but I guess they haven't.",

Because the producers needed to shoehorn an ape into the opening scene of this pathetic attempt to cash in on the original franchise. Instead of good writing we get lavish special effects and instead of actors we get Marky Mark Wahlberg, proving once again that his acting abilities range from large biceps all the way to ripped abs. An actual cardboard cutout would have been equally as watchable. Marky is however perfect for the role - this soulless attempt to cash in is emblematic of his own acting capability, which is comparable to a mannequin filled with botox.\nThis garbage has no redeeming features, from appalling dialogue, stock characters and writing that was presumably done by the chimps themselves.\nThe producers probably thought putting Marky beside less evolved simians could possibly place his performance in a favorable light.

Like the original he is chased by the apes and rounded up with a group of primitive humans.  We see Burton's vision of Ape Planet, and the  film makers decided to go with make up and prosthetics instead of CGI, it was a good call as the CGI would not have been up to par in 2001, the new Planet of the Apes showed it was possible to make great CGI apes, but that is now, and this was then.  This film again suffers from a watered down and confusing social and philosophical commentary, the caste system is gone, gone is the conflict of race, nuclear war and religion.  Instead there are call backs to some of the other Ape films, with humans as pets etc.  The humans however primitive do not act that way so again there is some confusion, and the twist at the end is funnier than it is original, the movie lends itself to some silliness that has a B movie quality to it, so it is watchable, but is very much more inferior product.",

The action is dull and boring, colorless and uninventive. It's nothing that hasn't been seen before, and Burton has proven on numerous occasions that he can do far better.

This Planet of the Apes reboot brings little to nothing new to the series with a brutally dull outcome.\n\nLook, it's easier said than done.  Remakes and reboots have a lot of pressure and usually wind up being a waste of time.  But there was serious potential here.  With Tim Burton coming off a few solid films with Johnny Depp and box office success with Batman, you'd think he would have a grapple on what to do with the Apes franchise.  Sadly, it was the exact opposite.\n\nThe original 1968 classic was thought provoking and lead to a couple really well done sequels, but Burton's take is disappointingly more creepy and awkward than it is cerebral.  I'm sorry, but I just don't care for seeing Mark Wahlberg have a strange romantic relationship with a female ape.  Or, rather, an equally dull relationship with a human, played by Estella Warren.  No chemistry between the two, whatsoever.\n\nBut there are a few redeemable qualities surprisingly.  Instead of a massive Statue of Liberty reveal at the end, Burton makes a few middle act changes that actually benefit the story in the long run.  Having the very cause of the apes taking over earth being due to Wahlberg's mistake was interesting, but I'm just not sure it was earned.  Something else that wasn't earned is the entire third act.  Talk about an atrocious piece of mess, the third act tries to propose so many ideas and take twists and turns that it just all feels tiresome.  Unfortunately, by the time the big battle comes around, you just don't care.\n\nIt's easy to look at a film in hindsight and say it shouldn't have been made, but seriously, this Apes entry should not have been made.  It wasn't yet the time where visual effects offered up the opportunity to do great motion capture or picture perfect-looking Apes (Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, 2014) and using old make-up was the wrong choice.  It's nice for the 60's but using it in 2001 is a completely different entity.  But the main problem is that the characters and story are second to an attempt to build out impressive set pieces.  Tim Roth's one-note villain and the film's choice for romances make for one brutal viewing.\n\n+Some interesting subtle changes\n\n-Lack of reinvention\n\n-Awkward romances\n\n-No reason for 2001 to be the time for a remake\n\n4.6/10",

The make-up effects and the ape movements are outstanding and the whole look of the film is great. I like the way they have combined the ape species instead of compartmentalizing them. Oh but there is so much wrong with it. The story seems to be more like the book in the sense of the planet, but this script is dire and the plot so see-through. The acting isn't terrible though. The cast are doing what they can with a dire script. What brings this tumbling down is the ending. Just awful.

Also, the villain acts and looks obvious from the first second you see it, lacks the build-up that charmed the film series, Not-Zira and all females look unrealistic in comparison to their male and female 60's and 70's counterparts, forced romances, stupid villains, stereotypes like the dumb teen and those that shouldn't have existed by then like black guy 60's attitude in white's point of view, modernizing the apes too much and out of place, ripping the kiss and other elements from the 1968 original, sci-fi elements that do not belong to the franchise, and on top of all, a horrible ending that is only less worse than the second film. Still with so many cons, there were a few pros, the make-up (for the male apes) is outstanding, the music by the great Danny Elfman is powerful, and the action sequences are the least bad of the franchise (because the series doesn't belong to the action genre). But overall, this film is the second worst of the franchise, just behind Beneath.",

        {
            "content": "I went into Planet of the Apes with my standards set pretty low because as I learned from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Dark Shadows, Tim Burton is no mastermind of remakes and is better at sticking to his own original material. And since the film he's remaking is famous for having one of the most surprising plot twists in cinema history, the surprise isn't there anymore and the plot is obviously predictable, and for a man not skilled at making remakes to handle a story that's been told so that it seems fresh is a case of the blind leading the audience through what has been seen once and doesn't need to be seen again.\n\nAnd his faults as a director, the man who was supposed to bring this film to life make themselves apparent very soon. \nFor one thing in terms of poor storytelling, I don't think the first thing that Astronauts would do upon finding a deadly electromagnetic storm is to send an inexperienced monkey into it followed by an astronaut in to find the monkey. There's a certain sense of logic in storytelling which Tim Burton naturally fails to pick up on.\nNext, Tim Burton's poor direction makes Planet of the Apes into a Science fiction comedy B-movie with its apes being largely used to comedic extents in human situations, but it's not funny and not beneficial to the science fiction theme which renders it a double failure. Not to mention that combined with a crappy script which can't go 20 minutes without butchering the classic line \"Take your stinkin' paws off me you damned dirty ape!\" by paraphrasing it in a manner that can be deemed insulting to the original film. But even worse the crappy script repeatedly hits viewers over the head with its message about how Planet of the Apes is an allegory for slavery of black people, because it makes humans not just the pets of apes, but the chefs and maids too. Not to mention the fact that humans can all talk in this one which removes the concepts of human beings being animal slaves to apes and replaces them with being general slaves. This isn't convincing, because they're a bunch of f*cking monkeys! If you can't figure that put, Tim Burton, then what had this all been for?\nAnd lastly, the actual 2 seconds the film spends reminding us that this is supposedly set on another planet from Leo Davidson's perspective is a prime example of the half-baked writing that went into Planet of the Apes. If I was half baked I'd probably enjoy it more, but I believe in saying no to drugs as well as saying no when Tim Burton wants to remake a film. This should be a good enough reason why.\nAnd the cast emit a mixed response.\nMark Wahlberg uses a routine charm as a means of giving decent line delivery, but his physicality makes it look like he's taking too long to figure everything out, and for a supposedly intelligent astronaut he looks like he's on some mix of marijuana and cocaine which can't decide on making him to calm to worry or too stressed to act. He isn't presented with any sort of character at all, so he just does a routine Mark Wahlberg job. If not for the terrible direction, it would be a routine success. Alas, Tim Burton tries hard to make sure this is not the case.\nHelena Bonham Carter proves to be of no benefit to the cast in Planet of the Apes, because her single tone of human voice, her humane physicality  and unconvincing costume make her seem like she's just an attempt to make a female look like I without remembering that this is a film about Apes which she seems to have forgotten too. Planet of the Apes is one of her much lesser efforts as an actress.\nEstella Warren's only real benefit to Planet of the Apes is to make a presence similar to Raquel Welch's in One Million Years B.C. where she had few lines and the focus was on her visual appeal. This is the same case for Estella Warren who has few lines and is only really there to give the pre-pubescent male viewers a boner. She may have done a better job if she had more lines, but hen again based on her monotonous stare in Planet of the Apes and poor performance in the sports film Driven which was released the same year I wouldn't be surprised if this was a false assumption. She succeeds at looking good though.\n\nOn a more positive note for the cast, Although Paul Giamatti is unfortunately stuck in the part of playing a comedic orangutan, which isn't benefitting to the film, luckily, Paul Giamatti's skilled physicality make him a convincing ape and his line delivery is pretty good.\nMichael Clarke Duncan is a great ape in Planet of the Apes because his intimidating physical structure and iconic voice make him reminiscent of the ape played by John Huston in Battle for the Planet of the Apes, which was the high point of the film. Michael Clarke Duncan is a good casting choice and does a good job, making himself seem like a real badass villain.\nKris Kristofferson is a genial presence in Planet of the Apes because his classic heroic western persona and facial hair cause the filmmakers to decide to model him after Tarzan. This is cool, because it's Kris Kristofferson and it's just cool to see him active on screen again.\nTim Roth did a decent job too, capturing a sense of sadism and insanity.\nPlanet of the Apes features great visual effects which capture the true science fiction essence of the story, and the film editing and cinematography help combine to make sure that Planet of the Apes is some kind of technical achievement. Much of the time these technicals make Planet of the Apes reminiscent of 1960's science fiction adventure films but with upgraded visuals, and so there is some satisfying nostalgia involved in Planet of the Apes. The musical score is also good because although not that iconic, it's intense and atmospheric which makes it effective.\n\nBut despite some decent cast members and technical elements, Tim Burton's direction ultimately brings Planet of the Apes down, making it start up on an unsatisfying note and end on an even more unsatisfying one.",

Burton focuses way too much time on the apes and not enough working up interesting scenes for the humans.  Either way, both species suffer with having to say bad lines and fall into flat stereotypes.  At least the actors can't be blames for that.  The insanity and preposterousness continues to escalate to the final act until reaching the twist ending.  At that point, throwing your tv out the window and screaming \"F*** logic!\" wouldn't be very frowned upon.

            "content": "This new Planet of the Apes is one of those lazy remakes: it does everything it wants in a very rushed and simple way, and it does nothing that the 1968 original did right. I do wonder how Tim Burton could make such a mess out of the Planet of the Apes. I guess we can blame some of the writers, as two of them worked on another big lazy and rushed movie: Superman IV. But still, how come Burton thinks a script like this one could be the best for a remake of a classic? This is a big misfire, a letdown and a self-indulgent movie that cares little about its uneven tone and structure.\r\n\r\nWe have a great cast here, but surprise, there's Tim Burton and her Helena Bonham Carter, but not Johnny Depp. Instead we have Mark Wahlberg, who does a decent job, but his character barely has any emotional resonance, ultimately nothing compared to Taylor, played by Charlton Heston in the 1968 original. The rest of the cast is top-notch, but their characters have little to workout. It doesn't help that every single character uses pure exposition to tell their stories: they tell what happened, instead of why it happened. And the movie sadly has exposition as the mechanism to tell the whole movie. The story itself is nothing special, it's very simple and the twists at the end are weak and self-explanatory, but cryptic. It's like the movie is always trying to end as quickly as possible, but the thing that made the first movie so great is the build-up of every single part of the story, until we finally see the truth at the very end: all build up lead to that. Here, it's only to make the story end, no build-up, no intensions of leaving a lasting impression, no intensions of care the bit less about the original. It deftly destroys the legacy of the Apes. In the original, it made sense that the humans were slaves, they were dumb, and they couldn't even speak or think. Here, it doesn't make sense, as the humans can talk, can think, THEY EVEN CAN FIGHT AGAINST THESE APES! Seriously, how did the Apes conquer earth when the humans had all the weapons at their hands? That is dumb, insulting to our intelligence and an insult to the original. Plus, the Apes are also dumb too. Auch, that hurts. There's one scene, when the humans are escaping, we see a bunch of apes doing the stupidest things: about to have sex, one of them is using a wig, another one is putting flowers around him...man, it ridiculous and shameful, that IS a big insult for the original Planet of the Apes. Plus, the ending is very...mixed. So much going on and so little explained...many declares this ending as one of the most horrible, but i didn't find it that bad. Surely a sequel was planned at the time, and plus, after almost two hours of shitty things, what other kind of ending could you expect?\r\n\r\nAnd yet, I found this movie admirable. It does have some B-movie elements and nice visuals. I like B-movie elements and visuals. It's the same case with the Clash of the Titans remake: I like it because it does everything wrong, but in a semi-epic way. I liked that they make the Apes characters still the most interesting in the movie, I liked the fight at the end, I liked the tone they gave to this movie, I liked the sets, I liked the short and fast-paced story-telling, I liked those make-up techniques, even if the female apes look very unconvincing, I liked the score by Danny Elfman, I liked the environment of this movie, I liked how they wanted this to be an action packed movie, damn this movie is full of my most basic movie instincts. I recognize why the hate, I sort of do too, but I also love it because of that, it's a guilty pleasure to say the least.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes with the other Planet of the Apes movies, this one is the second worst; the first is Beneath the Planet of the Apes, which is a bigger misfire. I'm sure I will return to watch this crap over and over. Curse my likes for B-movie charms.\r\n\r\nOh, Tim Burton...man, you made Batman! What the hell happened?!\r\n\r\nHAPPY HOLDIAYS REVIEWS PART 20 (FINAL): Planet of the Apes (2001)",

The ape make-up has definitely advanced, as have the special effects, but it's just lost all the heart and soul that the original had, to the point that not even the action scenes could save it.

The 2001 Planet of the Apes is a collection of uninteresting storytelling and characters, boring action, and not fun to watch in any way for the most part.  Plain and simple skip the 2001 film and watch the 1968 film.",

This special effects spectacle looks great on screen, but lacks the character and intelligence of the original. As a result, APES was a commercial success, but a critical failure. Astronaut Leo Davidson is thrust through time to find himself trapped on a world ruled by apes. After a planned escape, Davidson becomes the unexpected hero in a human revolt against the apes! The only real hero in PLANET OF THE APES is seven-time Oscar winner Rick Baker for his phenomenal make-up designs, which bring the apes to life in a wide array of different shapes and sizes. The apes simply look incredible, but unfortunately, the appliances hinder the performances of the actors, and often cause them to stumble through their lines. This is not the case for Helena Bonham Carter, who prefers to whisper incoherently, or Tim Roth, who just spits his vile contempt for humanity like venom. Where screenwriter William Broyles Jr. makes his biggest mistake is in allowing all humans to have the capacity of speech, which completely destroys the impact of Davidson's arrival on the planet. There can be no questioning of ape ethics or breakdown in ape philosophy if the lead character is no different than the humans that already exist on the planet. Coupled with Mark Wahlberg's stagnant performance, PLANET OF THE APES misses the point entirely. What is left is an entertaining but empty space epic that will be long forgotten in the years to come. \n\n-Carl Manes\nI Like Horror Movies",

This was the first Planet of apes film that I have seen.\n\nNone really understood the climax- a lot of my friends complained that the film's climax was too sense less. They mostly did not like the idea of apes behaving as modern day humans. It means that Wahlberg traveled through dimensions in the space ship and  reached the future of the planet of apes where the apes developed that much intelligence that they live almost like our modern day man. The critics always have a habit of criticizing anything they didn't fully understand, that is what happened with Cloud Atlas. Blade Runner was a film made by Ridley Scott. Upon release the film received lots of flak from critics because they couldn't understand it. Now Blade Runner is one of the most cult followed and critically acclaimed classics. I do not expect this Planet of apes version to have such a grand fan base in the future, but people may understand that it is not entirely stupid.\n\nThe only problem that i felt here was that the film has some idiotic humour sense as in the case with the most senseless Burton made 'Mars Attacks' (1998). You could actually experience the helplessness of Mark Wahlberg's character. The special effects are good too.",

If his goal was to piss people off...it worked. But I must commend Burton for including an ending such as the one in his vision of Planet of the Apes. Whether people liked the ending or not, it was memorable and it left an impression. Also, it was well within Burton's character to have an ending like that....very Burtonesque.

            "content": "My original review did not due justice to my dislike for this remake of the 1968 classic, especially after seeing every film in the franchise. This film deserves a fierce critical bitch-slapping, and I intend to give it one. I have no problem with remakes, and I have enjoyed several notorious remakes...but not this one. I could not find it in my very forgiving nature to give this giant middle finger/piss stain of the franchise a pass. The film was pretty doomed from the start since not only does Tim Burton seem out of his element directing a film like this, but the studio had the audacity to hire complete hacks for writers to pen the script - two of whom were the same two people who penned the script for the infamous Superman IV: The Quest For Peace, I shit you not. The biggest problem of the film, is the storyline, which is a major problem since storytelling has been a very pivotal aspect of the series, even during some of the wackier entries like Battle For The Planet Of The Apes (Which I enjoy as a guilty pleasure, but it views like a high-class art house flick in comparison to this piece of crap). The storytelling in this film is an absolutely horrible disaster with no focus, virtually no character development, ham-fisted messages about the evils of war and racism, and conflicts that feel forced and pointless. I didn't give a shit about any of the characters and I didn't even know the names of most of them by the time the film was over. I also didn't enjoy whatsoever how the film completely butchered classic lines from the original film. When I heard these new lines, they sounded like a cross between nails on a chalkboard and Justin Bieber music simultaneously occurring.  The film also fails miserably to be salvaged as a trashy action flick in the tradition of Conquest Of The Planet Of The Apes and Battle For The Planet Of The Apes, but even both those films were far more intelligent in terms of plot. Compounding the horrible storyline and horrifically dull action scenes is the horrible acting, which is surprising considering the talented cast that was assembled, which includes a brief cameo from Charlton Heston (Who only stops by to piss all over his legacy and then die unceremoniously. What a great use of a cameo!). Despite three horrible areas of the film, I must compliment a few things. First, the special effects (Both makeup and CGI) were absolutely spectacular and stunning to look at. I also must compliment the people who built the set pieces because those also look fantastic and should have been used for a much better film. And, finally, Danny Elfman manages to put together a decent score (It's certainly not his best work, but it's good), which feels suitably epic (Too bad it was wasted on such a turd for a film). However, those are the only things I will praise about the film, because the rest of it is an atrocious mess that insults the franchise and can't even be salvaged as a standalone film. This is one of the worst sci-fi/fantasy films and one of the worst remakes I've ever seen. No wonder it killed the franchise for another ten years! Thankfully, the franchise seems to be back on track and hopefully we will never see another film like this to curse the franchise.",

For instance, the humans are not brain dead and can actually talk!  The film's strengths are in its action scenes as well as its ability to represent intelligent apes with little reliance on CGI.  Mark Wahlberg is in the early stages of becoming an action star, and Tim Roth plays a very convincing evil ape.  I actually prefer the ending of this one over the original.

As it stands, the film is fine for what it is, perhaps something of a letdown considering the classic nature of the tale and the high level of talent involved in the project. Planet of the Apes is a decent movie taken at face value, perhaps best watched when the memories of the original, and superior, Charlton Heston version have become but a blur to the imagination after an extended period of time in between viewings.",

Comparing the Mark Wahlberg's character to Charlton Heston's, we see straight away what Tim Burton's remake lacks, the depth, the intrigue and the emotion. Many have said the film has a B-Movie feel and I agree with that 100%, however, the film deserves some recognition for the fantastic work done in the make up department for the Apes and Tim Roth was one of the actors in the film that stood out as being decent. Some changes in the plot were unnecessary and drew away from what made the original special and the great reveal and plot twist at the end was somewhat lackluster and failed to raise any hairs on the back of my neck or create any interest. Compared to the original, which it always is, Tim Burton's remake is abysmal and never quite reaches the standard of an alright movie.",

The sets, costumes, and make-up are all remarkably good and help to enhance the film.  However, the film concludes with one of the most ridiculous, nonsensical \"twist\" endings in history.
