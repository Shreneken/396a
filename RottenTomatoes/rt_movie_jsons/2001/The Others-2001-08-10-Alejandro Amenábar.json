After that, more and more eye-catching developments occur, but all that remains after watching the movie is the long and tedious explanation of the setting at the beginning and the shocking final scene. The last scene is also a rip-off of \"The Sixth Sense\". 0/5",

            "content": "In this film, two children are confined to their house with the curtains closed, never leaving during the day and screaming whenever they see sunlight. This is a reference to my standard daily lifestyle during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIt's fairly easy to look at The Others and write it off as a relatively conventional Sixth Sense knockoff, padding for time until the script gets to a big twist, but that would be selling the film short. Nicole Kidman is a beast here, doggedly exploring the mystery surrounding the unexplained phenomena of her elaborate mansion with the exasperated urgency of a parent protecting their children but finding little to fight back against. Her motivations are straightforward but the depth of her dedication is not, and she plays well off of Fionnula Flanagan's Bertha, a newly arrived housekeeper with a polite yet increasingly secretive nature. A haunted house film that is empathetic yet light on jumpscare, director Alejandro Amen√°bar is largely successful at creating an atmosphere-driven film that leaves an appropriate amount of breadcrumbs to hint at the film's multiple twists, even if the rules of the universe must be bent slightly to accommodate them. \n\nMade effective by touching on natural human insecurities, such as a fear of the unknown and an inability to protect the ones that we love, The Others is well-put-together (if not totally original), well-shot, and solidly creepy. (3.5/5)",

Creepy and it isn't until the film is over that you put all the pieces together the more you think on it. The film approaches the genre with the less is more mentality, a welcome change of pace from most modern horror films, and is more atmospheric and creepy because of it. The film is supposed to take place right after World War II and makes for a good ghost story setting, leaving the isolated home more cut off from the outside world and modern convinces such as cell phones and computers. Overall, I liked the film a lot and while it deals with an extremely rare disease it makes it fit in well with the supernatural story that is the center of the story.",

Its also a film where I was very late to the party. I did spend a lot of the time trying to figure out what the secret was, ultimately to no avail, but I was always interested in where the story was going and what was happening to the characters. Nicole Kidman, a relative stranger to horror films, absolutely sells the terror and growing paranoia that she experiences, creeping round her massive house with a look that says ‚ÄòI may not survive this.' There's never any doubt that she fears for the safety for herself and her family and it was one of the films strongest elements. The mystery of the housekeepers and the house's true nature keeps you guessing, and the film perfectly demonstrates that you don't need jump scares and fake outs to unsettle an audience. We barely even see the things that torment our heroine and her family, and yet they're always a viable and constant threat. I can't say it's a new classic or that it set some kind of standard for films to come, but it's a film that knows how to keep its audience in suspense, develop its scenario, and that when it comes to revealing the spooky entities, less is always more.",

            "content": "A haunting depiction of motherly love.\n\nAlejandro Amenabar's supernatural psychological horror film The Others (2001) is a masterclass in filmmaking and acting. A modern horror classic for fans of The Sixth Sense, The Village, The Shining, Mulholland Drive, and A Ghost Story. Amenabar's writing is refreshingly heartfelt for a horror movie with a dramatic tale of love, grief, loss, isolation, paranoia, spirituality, and hope all centered as themes. You are constantly tense on edge waiting for a jump scare, but rather you are pleasantly gifted with scary situations and nerve-racking suspense instead. Amenabar's direction is stunning and focused on pulling emotions out of you, so that you feel both frightened and devastated during The Others' brief 101 minute run-time. He even composed the score for The Others to ensure a spooky atmosphere and unnerving vibe at all times.\n\nNicole Kidman's lead actress performance as Grace Stewart is riveting in one of her most powerful dramatic roles. Kidman cries, shrieks, and glares her way into your heart. You feel for her lonely woman stuck living with her frail children in her massive mansion. Kidman finds the heart of her character's pain and keeps you engaged with her impressive accent, stern attitude, and vulnerable portrayal. You have to see Kidman's poignant acting in The Others!\n\nFionnula Flanagan is outstanding as the supporting actress opposite Kidman in The Others named Mrs. Bertha Mills. Her kindly nanny, diligent house maid, and curious soul make for an endearing character that keeps you guessing. Flanagan is just as intriguing as Eric Sykes as Mr. Edmund Tuttle the strange gardener. Elaine Cassidy is pretty and upsetting as the mute girl Lydia in her subtle depictions of uncertainty and sorrow. All three of these supporting characters contribute to The Others' overall mystery.\n\nChristopher Eccleston gets a moving cameo as the post-traumatic stress disorder stricken husband to Kidman's Grace named Charles Stewart. His cold and broken portrayal of a soldier coming home from World War II a different man is striking and resonant. I am awe struck by his crying while Kidman is pouring her heart out to him during a sad confrontational scene.\n\nNotably, The Others features two incredibly strong and convincing child actors. Alakina Mann is fun, adorable, monstrous, mean, playful, and gripping as Kidman's daughter Anne Stewart. You are captivated by her careful performance that gives an honest portrayal of a young girl trying to cope with her mother's madness. Likewise, James Bentley is wonderful as Nicholas Stewart in all his childish fear and cowardly persona. Bentley is empathetic as such a young boy caught in a scary situation. You truly believe his character feels every line with an unsettling fear.\n\nJavier Aguirresarobe's cinematography is a stunning selection of dark moody faces and empty rooms. He captures the isolated, haunted feel in each shot. I love the way he frames Nicole Kidman's face in close-up shots, so that she feels both likable and strange in a dangerous ominous fashion. The use of dim natural lighting and slow panning shots is brilliantly effective at keeping The Others feeling frightful in the darkness. By the same note, Nacho Ruiz Capillas' editing is sleek and polished as The Others flows smoothly from room to room. His cuts are effortless and nicely paced, so that the audience may sit with these fascinating characters in their haunted house.\n\nFurthermore, Benjamin Fernandez' production design offers a rich home with lavish furnishings and classy style for a Gothic setting and moody vibe. Sonia Grande's costumes feel period accurate and neat to look at, especially all of Kidman's beautiful dresses. Her clothing choices make The Others feel strict, rigid, conservative, religious, and memorable.\n\nLastly, The Others has a massive twist ending that's telegraphed and alluded to early on and throughout the movie, so that you can believe in the fantastic finale. The Others is simply a magnificent drama with a sublime horror story core.",

            "content": "There hasn't been a genuinely chilling good old-fashioned haunted house story since 1963's Robert Wise classic, The Haunting. However, with the success of The Sixth Sense, the ground was set to produce horror films that would leave you looking over your shoulder in a dark room, What we have in The Others is a twist to a age-old ghost story which is thoughtful and unexpected.\n\nNicole Kidman plays Grace Stewart, a young woman waiting for her husband to return from the now ended, Second World War. She is isolated in a grand old mansion with her two sick yet playful children. Because they suffer from photo-sensitive skin condition, they are unable to be exposed to any kind of sunlight. In order to stop any harm coming to her children, the house must be in pitch darkness throughout the day. This sets the scene perfectly in terms of a ghost story. The house is empty, with no servants (They left in a hurry for no reason) and the story begins with the arrival of three new servants.\n\nThis is an intelligent thriller which does have some exceedingly spooky moments. The proceedings are aided immensely by the screen performance of Nicole Kidman, who establishes a convincing character embodying all the turmoil of the emotions as the hauntings begin to escalate. The two child actors also play good supporting roles that is believable and charming. Christopher Eccleston makes a welcomed appearance as the shell-shocked husband who returns abruptly.\n\nThe actual atmosphere created in this film echoes that of Robert Wise's work, with the use of disembodied sounds and threatening dark corners. The house is chilling, to say the least. It is empty and full of dusty attics that are ideal settings for ghost stories. The tension builds to a point where you might suspect a ghost to jump out at the characters that are alone in a room. It doesn't help when a ghost is described as a nightmarish old hag either! This is not a story with slimy bug-eyed monsters that suck out your brains but an intelligent study of what frightens people. It's simply the basics of a darkened old Victorian room that still has the timeless resonance to scare you witless. You might say that this is clich√©d but this is genuinely frightening stuff. This is also a story of the people who live in the house as well. The hauntings exacerbate the psychological stress of Grace's situation with her sick children and the new servants are not exactly sympathetic to her either.\n\nThe final mention goes to the conclusion of the story. It was unexpected for me and you have your suspicions but the film manages to flip them around completely. It's not a twist like in Sixth Sense which some managed to see coming from the onset of the movie.",

Amenabar's execution is brimmed with such panache that it uses concepts of mirage and lightings and such other tricky camera work to scare the bejesus out of the audience rather than relying upon typical hokum equations like creatures or benign art designing to enhance its intensity. \n\nThe malleable mythological tale with an updated version that actually warps us back to ancient times, is the key and the theme that fuels this poised and reserved tale that is too sincere to its mannerism. The background score is brilliant along with the jaw dropping cinematography, sharp sound effects and fine editing. The narrative is way too sharp than it seems and the primary reason to that is the awareness of the writer of the chemistry and the equation and each tiny characteristic of the characters. \n\nThis is not your average scoreboard mentality natured script, it runs on merit of bratty and rebellious kids against the overprotective emotions which will leave you shook on your seats. Kidman is the only performer in here that makes it all work and flaunts her potential to make you writhe on your seat by being on the same side of the coin as yours. \n\nEach mirror on screen, each ray of candlelight, each shady room and each painting, everything that Amenabar places on screen, he is fiddling with you subconsciously while we sit nervously and our fingers half eaten off as he narrates it. Kidman's stellar performance and Amenabar's finesse on execution and his jagged script are the high points of the feature. \n\nThe Others is a lot about us and that is how we are able to easily communicate with them, you'd want to find out who is singing.",

            "content": " **SPOILERS** There are times when I wish you could selectively wipe away memories, and that is particularly true when I go to watch a movie with any kind of surprise ending and I‚Äôve already had the surprise spoiled for me. I feel like nowadays just revealing that a movie has a twist at the end is a spoiler because it forces you to watch a movie differently, so I apologize to those who didn‚Äôt know that about The Others. In this case, not only did I know there was a twist, but I knew exactly what it involved. I‚Äôm sad to say that hurt my experience watching the movie a lot. However, to discuss that any further would require me to actually talk about the twist, so fair warning that I‚Äôll be spoiling the whole film and those who haven‚Äôt seen it should look away. **SERIOUSLY NOW, MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD** The atmosphere of the film is spooky. I thought the visuals were gorgeous and the way they used light-and-shadow to heighten the mood was great. The cast was superb, which allowed us to feel the horror with Nicole Kidman, while being creeped out by the mysterious older staff members. But, because I knew that they were all ghosts already, I had no fear. It dissolved all the tension when I faced the reality that there was no danger and nothing that could harm them. I can see how the movie would have been masterful at building up the drama right up until the end, and that revelation would be a gut punch for some people. However, because someone spoiled it long ago for me, I never got that sensation. Instead my journey through The Others was one of investigation. I was trying to piece together what exactly happened, and what the rules were of this afterlife. I didn‚Äôt feel like the film gave me enough concrete answers, so I was a disappointed. I also had trouble sympathizing with Nicole Kidman as the protagonist since I knew what she had done. It makes her an unpleasant main character, and not one I want to spend time worrying about through the whole movie. It‚Äôs too bad because I enjoy so many of the elements of this film, but it may have hinged too much on the twist for my taste. I can see what people enjoy in this movie, and I like how it put a new spin on a familiar type of horror film, but I wanted something more (or to have my memory wiped before watching.)",

Grace is an absolute nutter isn't she ? But then the story twists and turns a little and then I thought she might be a victim , I mean these servants ... But the story keeps twisting along nicely so that the script is one step ahead of the audience . There is a slight problem though if you're familiar to Amenabar's work , especially ABRE LOS OJOS and that is that he's a master of the shock twist ending and I thought with the appearance of Eccleston's Charles Stewart half way through the movie I had the story sussed . I actually did work out how he fitted into the story and was correct in guessing his fate but I never believed in what the twist ending was so well done Senor Amenabar \n\nThere is a problem with this type of story and THE OTHERS is no different in that respect - You can only enjoy the movie once since you know the shock twist at the end when you see it a second , third , fourth time and there's another very successful film ( No clues but you'll know the one I'm talking about after you see this ) that has the same idea which means comparison's are inevitable , but it's difficult to compare to one another . Certainly THE OTHERS has a more creepy atmosphere and probably a better pace and cast with special mention going to Alakina Mann as Anna who plays her role as a totally convincing horrid brat , nice to know Amenabar has resisted the temptation to portray the children as sugery sweet little cherubs which is often the case in Hollywood movies , you might not believe this but THE OTHERS in fact is a Spanish film",

With an honest script, that does not try to pass the leg, but knew how to make the catch with the viewer, Alejandro Amen√°bar does a good job, because the complete work of the film makes him intelligent and intriguing, although he creates several subplots, and does not explain any And with several repetitions of ideas that do not compromise the experience of the film, Alejandro Amen√°bar uses the soundtrack the way one has to use in a horror film, high, sharp and uncomfortable. \"The Others\" is a good suspense movie, tries to take advantage of a climate already seen in several other films, and an end that became fashionable in the 90s, but even so, it has many merits, and in a way, still surprises .",

Although it might seem like the repetitive story of a family moving to a haunted house, experiencing paranormal events, you later will come to realise that, in fact, it is not. The twist at the end will leave you speechless. It might be an old movie, but the way the story is presented is excellent. It is an excellent ghost movie, really frightening, although it does not have disturbing scene such as gore, therefore, it is safe to watch by people of all ages.",

Although the setup of this dark, intense \"ghost\" story is familiar, THE OTHERS surprisingly eschews all the cliches you would expect.  Sure, there are moments that do come across as creepy and the expected suspenseful buildups, but the end result is more of a heartbreaking psychological drama with supernatural elements as opposed to, say, a monster.  I won't give away anything else about the story, as this is one of those movies that has to be seen in order to get the full experience.  But THE OTHERS is about as abnormal as horror movies go; it's intelligent, emotionally charged, and has a surprise ending that will make one suspect they've just viewed a TWILIGHT ZONE half hour.  THE OTHERS is not heavy on visual effects, but instead relies on period settings and costumes.  The film is all the more effective because of that.  Nicole Kidman delivers a convincingly intense and simultaneously loving performance as the lead character, and the dynamic between her and her children is the primary reason that you'll be nailed to every second of this low-key shocker.",

The problem about it, is that when I first watched it, the film was on Netflix and then it expired, so I waited for the opportunity to watch The Others again. When Netflix surprisingly has the movie again, I was very excited to watch it again, and it still holds up very well. Nicole Kidman gives a memorable and emotional performance that you understand and feel sorry for her for what the character is going through. The kids are really good that I'm starting to realize that it's actually not that hard to find child actors that has the acting chops for it. The director also did the score for the movie which is nice to see that he knows how to set and sound up a creepy and unsettling vibe that fits in to this movie. The writing is well done and really makes this film investing despite the movie having a slow pace. The suspense and scares in this are effective in this that my heart was pounding a bit. It had a bit of a sense of humor which is actually kinda funny, and the build-up for what's happening is very strong and it makes you wonder what's going on. When it got the conclusion of the build-up, it's very surprising and it makes me happy that the movie shows that you can do the same twist ending that has been before, but do it in a different way that makes it shocking and refreshing at the same time. The Others is a very scary movie that has a great ghost story that is constructionally and creepily done well enough which makes the movie memorable.",

They live in a secluded, generally large home and start to hear and, sometimes, see intruders roaming their house, coincidentally right after the mother, Grace (Kidman), just hired a housemaid and two others. One thing leads to another that finally concludes with one of the better twist endings I've seen in some time.\n\nNow, with the plot synopsis out of the way, I can proudly say that I think that \"The Others\" is one of the BEST horror films of the 2000s (2000-2009). What I loved about the film is the great suspense. There aren't many things that are given away early, which in my opinion is mandatory for any horror movie to reach great suspicion. I must say, however, there are some parts in the film that don't seem like cliches, but definitely have a familiar feeling, especially the twist ending, which didn't really bother me since I really didn't see the twist coming. Overall, \"The Others\" is a brilliantly good looking movie with a great cast that I can truly call one of the better horror films of the 2000s. 7.4/10",

This film has got a lot of twists and thrills that are quite unlike most of the other films that I have seen, although I find it closely similar to The Sixth Sense. Nicole Kidman's performance is good and the ending of the film proves to be a satisfying twisty one. Although I don't approve of the film's direction, the scares are well constructed, but still it could have been as good as The Sixth Sense itself had the ending been made a bit more emotional.",

This 2001 thriller however, still gets its amount of praise, as it benefits from two strong assets. Number one, Nicole Kidman is fabulous in this movie. She plays the tormented and suffering Grace, a woman who is so unhappy and longing for her probably deceased husband, and a mother who is too hard on her children. Her portayal is not ground-breaking, nor is the film, but she delivers intensity when it is needed and she is the one in charge of leading us through the plot.\nNumber two, this film has a fabulous ending, and that's why people still like it today. The huge twist at the third act may not surprise you as much as it surprised audiences before however, but still, I didn't guess it, and its execution is brilliant.\nThe rest of the film is a mixed bag. The development is painfully slow, and while Amenabar is certainly talented at creating an eerie atmosphere, most of the tension come in spurts, and then we have overlong doses of dramatic sluggishness. The Others is too dense to do spooky effectively.\nI love a solid horror movie, as they are really hard to find. The genre can provide great stories, while always providing splurges of entertainment and suspense. The Others is not a solid horror movie, as it is not a horror film, or a thriller or a drama. The problem with The Others is that it doesn't know what it is.",

            "content": "Said to be a simple horror film with a chilling twist, The Others sounded like a horror film with an interesting concept.\n\nBut I found myself disappointed with The Others in the end. The main issue I found was the fact that it constantly deviated back and fourth between being a horror film and being a drama. The horror themes in the film were too low-key in comparison the drama that the story kept focused on, and yet it tried to be both films. The Others wants to be both a legitimate horror film and a complex psychological drama, but director Alejandro Amenabar fails to find the appropriate balance to make it work. The issue is that the film has the potential to be a great horror film involving the mysteries of a haunting, but the story is too focused on protagonist Grace Stewart dealing with the drama of being an isolated mother waiting for the return of her husband while she attempts to take care of her children. While The Others could have been an innovative horror film, it is too focused on the drama surrounding the character Grace Stewart who I was unable to sympathise for which left the film absent of being compelling in my opinion.\nAdmittedly, the fact that The Others makes an attempt to create thrills through an eerie atmosphere in a more classic film style is admirable considering that the age we live in is focused more on blood and gore to create shocks. And there are some moments where I found the film to be chilling thanks to Alejandro Amenabar's ability to create a genuine horror atmosphere. So his role as director is good, but I failed to find the story that interesting. It was less about the horror than it was about the melodrama, and if it was more focused on building a chilling atmosphere than it was on trying to make its protagonist a deep character then it could have been good. The mix between horror and drama pleased a lot of critics, but I found it to be quite on the contrary and it was like a soap opera mixed with elements of the supernatural. I'm not a fan of soap operas, so I was not a fan of The Others either. And I really just could not understand what angle Alejandro Amenabar was taking on the story or why he was doing it which left me confused at the film and particularly its ending.\nThe performances of Alakina Mann and James Bentley were good, but I had trouble sympathising for their characters because I found them so annoying. They were loud and obnoxious children, and even when their mother attacked them I failed to care. So one of the issues with The Others is that some of the characters alienated me from the film.\nThe Others has a very slow pace consistently, but if it was more of a legitimate horror film than I would have been able to tolerate that and take the time to enjoy things as they developed at a natural pace. But unfortunately, the fact that the film kept deviating between being a dramatic character study and a horror film threw me off and made the 104 minute experience of The Others feel a lot longer and a lot less entertaining. The entire experience was dull for me which is a shame because The Others could have been a great horror film about a haunting in a large house, and its setting was terrific. I mean the house that the main characters live in is a huge and old with a feeling of isolation and genuine fear in the air, and it is all captured with fine cinematography techniques against a musical score which is intense and eerie. So The Others had a serious amount of potential. But it could not transcend the fact that it was really a drama film at heart, and as a drama it is absent of elements that are all that much compelling leaves it as a poor quality film. The drama comes from the turmoil that a wife and mother faces as she attempts to protect her children and wait for the return of her husband, but it has been covered in many superior films and this example of the subject matter does not meld with the horror themes all that well. Frankly, if The Others did not have such an iconic twist ending there would be little to actually separate it from the many superior films that it is similar to. Yet even with it, The Others does not make much of an impact. If I watched the film from the start with full awareness of its twist ending, it would be a lot less of an experience than it is now, but I do have to give it credit for its originality in that regard.\nThe Others' most positive aspect aside from the atmosphere in the film is the terrific lead performance from Nicole Kidman. Although I didn't really find the character that compelling because I found the entire film to be rather melodramatic, Nicole Kidman's performance is a psychologically troubled wife and mother was terrific. She captured the part very well and held the screen with a lot of emotionally frailty from start to finish. Her voice articulation had her capturing her character's accent genuinely well and the pure power in her line delivery had a lot of strength to it. Nicole Kidman's leading performance in The Others manages to make the story feel more realistic than it is set up to, and if I knew the pains of being a mother or a wife then perhaps I would have enjoyed the film more. Nicole Kidman made me feel confident of that.\n\nBut despite Nicole Kidman's tense portrayal, The Others goes back and fourth between classical horror and melodrama without finding a balance or maintaining any consistent entertainment value to make it stand out, regardless of its clever plot twist.",

It was all the more terrifying just watching Nicole Kidman's acting, her firm parental style, her frightened, panicked style and the quiet mournful style.

I will try to speak as little of the plot as possible in this review so as to not spoil it for you if you have yet to watch it. If you have, then I implore to not reveal anything regarding the plot in the comments. So, here is what I think about The Others. \n\nThis is the premise of the story. Grace is a mother living in a huge mansion taking care of her two children, Nicholas and Anna, while her husband, Charles, is off fighting in World War II. Three new servants have arrived at their doorstep and the children claims that there are others in the house apart from them. Fearful for her pride and her faith, she chooses to deny the claim until strange things start happening to her. There are voices and noises and the mysterious new servants. All I can say after that is that the story culminates in plot twists, a satisfying climax, and a suitably emotional and conclusive ending. \n\nThis movie is one of those rare films that actually effectively and convincingly utilises plot twists apart from The Sixth Sense, The Empire Strikes Back, The Game, Fight Club, Psycho, A Beautiful Mind (it would be effective in this film if one does not have prior knowledge of the mathematician John Nash) and Shutter Island. The screenplay is pretty good with well-developed characters and bits of clues here and there to later explain the plot twists at the climax. For a horror movie, it was surprisingly nominated for Best Original Screenplay at the BAFTA Awards. The acting is also brilliant. Nicole Kidman performs strongly as the ever-in-denial and fretful mother, who is both a devout Christian and overly loving and protective to her children who are both hyper sensitive to light. Fionnula Flanagan as the mysterious yet somewhat amiable servant Bertha Mills also offers quite a performance. \n\nOn the technical side, visual effects are of course kept to a minimum here. One of the most notable aspects is the cinematography. Apart from capturing the rather dull and gloomy atmosphere of the English countryside, there are some interesting techniques used as well, such as the 90 degrees camera rotation across the room as the curtains are being drawn. The production design is quite exquisite as well, showing both the splendour and creepiness of a large and virtually empty English mansion. Director Alejandro Amenabar provides the music for his own movie and it is actually pretty good; sweeping and subtle at solemn moments and bone-chilling in those of terror. \n\nOverall, a surprisingly good take on the horror haunted house genre with effective plot twists and one which relies, not on gore and violence, or frightening imageries, but on atmosphere alone to creep.",

She plays Grace Stewart, a mother living in an old house with her two children who cannot be exposed to light and eventually become convinced that her home is haunted. Kidman performs really well in her role; she fully transforms in to that woman, in to the character written for her compared to how she is in real life, in the various interviews I've seen of her. It's interesting to me how Grace does not believe what her daughter is seeing but tells the daughter and the son about the Bible and the various punishments in hell; basically says the daughter is inventing stories but Grace is pretty much doing the same thing and doesn't realize it. Alakina Mann and James Bently are marvelous as her children, especially the boy who is so well dressed and adorable; his face at times convinces me that he is actually an adult in a child's body (not his personality, of course). There are a few other members of the house that I will not reveal. It's labeled as a psychological horror film, there isn't any bloodshed; it relies on a tight script, splendid performances, and good amount of suspense. I was initially hesitant to see it, because I am afraid to watch horror films alone (I do enjoy them), and it did give me a few chills, but wasn't really that scary. I am also suspicious of the film's logic concerning the rules of the living and dead seeing each other and other events that happen later on. I guess the only thing you can do is view it for what it is and enjoy it and not ponder why or why not certain things happened in a particular way. It's a good horror film, but its major plot changes are a little too predictable even if they are well narrated, acted, and directed.\n\n What would I give to see Alfred Hitchcock direct Nicole Kidman?",

Zwar ist die genretypische Effekthascherei allgegenw√§rtig, und bei n√§herer Betrachtung w√ºrden sicher Unmengen an Ungereimtheiten aufgedeckt werden k√∂nnen, aber The Others\" tut was er kann, und erreicht genau den Effekt auf den er abzielt.\n\nEs ist ein spannendes St√ºck Kino das uns pr√§sentiert wird, der Aufbau der Atmosph√§re geht stetig und stimmig von dannen, und ich bin dem Film sehr dankbar daf√ºr dass er auf Dummheiten wie Jump Cuts und Gore Szenen verzichtet. Stattdessen setzt Amenabar auf eine Mischung aus Beleuchtung, Soundeffekten und Atmosph√§re.\nAls kleines Gimmick, muss das Haus der Familie ganzt√§gig verdunkelt werden, da die Kinder an einer Art Sonnenallergie leiden. Welchen Effekt das auf die Lichtverh√§ltnisse hat muss ich glaube ich nicht weiter ausf√ºhren.\nDie Struktur des Films ist bemerkenswert. Nur wenige Horrorfilme (The Shining\" ist hier als prominenter Vertreter zu nennen) bem√ºhen sich so sehr Charaktere und Gegebenheiten zu erforschen bevor der eigentliche Horror beginnt. The Others\" ist, f√ºr die erste Viertelstunde zumindest, ein stinknormaler Kost√ºmfilm, ein Familiendrama √ºber eine Witwe und ihre Kinder nach Ende des 2. Weltkriegs. Erst nach und nach beginnen sich seltsame Dinge im Haus abzuspielen, und die Geschichte wird immer verworrener bis hin zum finalen Twist, der sowohl genial als auch genugtuend ist.\nAn dieser Stelle muss ich den Machern jedoch auch vorwerfen, dass es ab einem gewissen Punkt zu kryptisch und √ºberm√§√üig mysteri√∂s wird. Immer wieder wird die Aufl√∂sung nach hinten verschoben, ohne noch zus√§tzliches Material in den Plot hineinzubringen. Ich kann es partout nicht leiden, wenn ich mich manipuliert f√ºhle, und das war hier ganz eindeutig der Fall.\n\nNichtsdestotrotz, dies ist ein handwerklich ausgezeichneter Film mit einigen visuell herausragenden Szenen und einer der besten Kinderschauspielleistungen (in Person von Alakina Mann, die die Tochter spielt) die ich in letzter Zeit gesehen habe. Kidman wird von den Kindern in den Schatten gestellt, The Others\" ist trotzdem eine ihrer gelungeneren Bem√ºhungen.",

Nicole Kidman is solid as the woman who takes on three suspicious servants and the child actors who may or may not see ghosts (echoes of The Innocents here) are fine.  On subsequent viewings, once the story is fully revealed, perhaps things are a tad less gripping.  But true to the spirit of Open Your Eyes, things are not always what they seem.",

Strange sounds and odd occurences wrack the quiet halls of the house, leading the children to believe that it may be haunted by the spirits of the past. After reaching world renown with his brilliant psychological thriller OPEN YOUR EYES, Spanish director Alejandro Amen√°bar returns with this chilling take on Gothic Horror entitled THE OTHERS. Inspired by genre classics like Jack Clayton's THE INNOCENTS or James Whale's THE OLD DARK HOUSE, Amen√°bar allows himself plenty of time to build a steady growing suspense and oppressive mood. The director frequently winks at the audience through the character of Mrs. Mills, alluding to one of several plausible twist endings. Each of the cast members, including Nicole Kidman but especially the children, perform very well, and add to the playful ambiguity of the plot. The overall result is a tighly-drawn tension that will have audience members leaping out of their seats for the many surprise moments! A finely-crafted ghost story if ever there was one.",

With its roots going all the way back to the era of H.G Welles, gothic horror has taken the world of cinema by storm.  The horror genre has proved to be immensely popular, and The Others, directed by Alejandro Amen√É¬°bar and starring Nicole Kidman, doesn√¢(TM)t buck that trend.\n\n        The Others follows a mother and her two children, the children both being photosynthetic, meaning almost constant darkness, in a very large house shrouded in both mystery and fog.  It is with this very large house shrouded in both mystery and fog that an eerie mood is instantly unleashed.  You also quickly realise that it seems Alejandro Amen√É¬°bar is sticking to the rules of gothic horror: foggy setting, constant darkness, mysterious characters, a sense of isolation√¢¬¶ the list goes on.  So, with all these gothic horror features, the film felt all too familiar and rather unoriginal. \n\n        But the film takes a step away from gothic horror and towards psychological horror.  This is a smart move for me, because otherwise it feels like I√¢(TM)ve seen the film hundred times before.  But with this step into a more psychological horror, it stands out from the crowd. \n\n        It√¢(TM)s this psychological side that, I felt, made this film a lot scarier; that and three enchanting performances from the family, with none of them holding back on emotion or power.  But for me what really makes this film a success, is the spellbinding twist at the end that, while at first being hard to get to grips with, bolsters the film massively.\n\n        Scary, magnificently acted, wonderfully scripted, this film in my opinion is very good example of how to make a genuinely scary film, without silly effects or bloody violence; simply, a sense of fear and mystery and some powerful performances.",

This movie is particularly a horror british movie, and its the best british movie by the genre. Nicole Kidman has never looked lovely, her performance was very powerful and demanding, she was the powerhouse female of the movie. And the young actors were very talented as well, I thought they had the acting chops of a young Haley Joel Osment. Kidman's accent in the movie is very convincing as well, I never thought she had that british voice in her. The twist was very memorable and shocking at the same time, the scares were not only effecting but you felt them, the performances were superb (especially Nicole Kidman), the music was chilling, and for a movie that talks about brutal deaths in disturbing ways, I was glad the director used creepy images and the chill factor instead of gory images. Like \"The Woman in Black\", \"The Others' is one of the few best PG-13 horror movies that work in many effecting ways.",

            "content": "For some reason, when I see this film's title, I can help but feel as though \"Others\" is refering to minorities, though that's probably because this film is owned by just about every culture in the world. Yeah, more like \"The Other Side of the Border\" (I am so sorry, but I just couldn't resist), because it's American, French, Italian and, perhaps most of all, Spanish (Wait, didn't I just say Italian?), even though it's in English, features a cast of performers from English-speaking countires (Well, we do have a few Irish people, so I say that loosely) and takes place in Britain. Come on, Alejandro Amen√°bar, at least Luc Besson has the decency to set his English-speaking French films in France... sometimes. Oh wait, this film actually was shot in Madrid... and that's about all I can give it credit for, yet that didn't stop the Goyas from giving this film eight awards, including Best Film, while all of those poor, Spanish-speaking Spanish films of 2001 found themselves lost in the dust. Shoot, looking at the success of English-language cinema, at this point, I don't know if the foreigners are even watching their own films. Hey, at least the foreigners have decent taste in English-language films, because, I've got to say, this American-Italian-Spanish-French-Japanese-Australian-Klingon-Irish-German-whatever flick is an enjoyable one. Of course, for every point in this film that hits, there are plenty \"other\" points that don't so much.\r\n\r\nAlejandro Amen√°bar's screenplay is generally pretty decent, with what missteps there are within the script being reasonably few and far between, as well as not all that terribly intense to begin with, yet the fact of the matter is that the script does, in fact, make missteps, and ones that, while standing to be worse, still do some damage to the film, or at least the effectivness of the film's consistent level of seriousness. Whether it through some weak occasions in dialogue or through a couple of other somewhat improvable writing areas (I know xeroderma pigmentosa is a real thing, but may this film gets a touch carried away with its \"light allergy\" aspects), the film cheeses up a touch, and occasionally at reasonably crucial moments, thus leaving you to momentarily go a bit disengaged, if not just plain rather distanced, which isn't to say that the actual tightness of the flawed plotting doesn't assist in the final products' being rather distanced in the writing department at times. There are only a couple of small spots within Amen√°bar's script that are rather improvable, but what stands as most prominent and more detrimental to the film are faults in such more major writing aspects as story structure, for although this film manages to come up with enough of a reasonable amount of dynamicity to keep you going, there's only so much you can do with a story this minimalist before things begin to plummet into repetition that does quite a deal of damage to the steam and helps in keeping the film from taking off as much as it probably should. Of course, while this film does stand to pick up more often, it's not like things were ever intended to stay all that consistently juiced, as this story is, as I said, just so minimalist, and often too much so for its own good, having one setting and only so much bite to the plot, thus creating a basic story layout that doesn't stand a chance of hitting too terribly much, yet still stands to hit more sharply in execution than it ultimately does. There is immediate blandness within the film's concepts, but what really hurts this film the most is Alejandro Amen√°bar's keeping faithful, as director, to his script's blandness by drying up the film's atmosphere all too often at times, to where the moments without thrills and chills that stand as quite possibly most abundant find themselves renered much too slow, if not just plain, well, dull. The film isn't a total bore, but it is dry and limp, with atmospheric blandness to bring more to attention the story blandness, exacerbated by other writing missteps that cut at this project time and again, until the final emerges as rather underwhelming. Regardless of this, for every misstep, there is a strength, and while the strengths don't hit quite hard enough for the final product to, as a whole, hit with as much strength as it should, they still stand as firm enough to engage you through and through, or at least sell you on this world.\r\n\r\nSeeing as how this film's scope is quite limited, there's not really a whole lot of material for the art and production departments to work with, so don't go in expecting the piece of production-heavy spectacle that is such other 2001 films as \"Fellowship of the Ring\", but do expect the art direction and production designs to be buyable, as well as manipulative of the minimalist scope enough to supplement a sense of claustrophobia. The film doesn't always bite, yet there is generally a genuinely tight air of intrigue that brings this film to particular life, and is itself brought to life by both the art direction's and production design's aforementioned clever plays with the minimalism within the scope and the mostly pretty inspired and even fairly firm establishment of atmosphere by director Alejandro Amen√°bar. Amen√°bar's atmosphere is all too often perhaps a little bit too dry for its own good, but is never really bone-dry, having enough inspired kick to it to keep the slow spots from dulling out too tremendously, and when tensions really start to raise in the form of creepiness, or claustrophobia, or even all-out consequence, Amen√°bar drives the film under your skin and pulls you to the edge of your seat, engrossed and eager to see what is to happen next, if not actually a little bit shook up. Of course, with all of the chills and whatnot, this film is driven more by its substance than its simple horror aspects, and while the film's substance is structured and directed rather messily at times, on the whole, Amen√°bar, as both writer and director, draws quite a bit of depth and weigh from this reasonably promising concept for you to find yourself engaged by the characters and dramatic plot. It all comes down to a twist that, quite frankly, has been done time and again before, and really isn't too terribly hard to predict, but still bites nevertheless, going backed by enough weight and inspiration within Amen√°bar's storytelling for you to walk away with quite a fair bit to ponder about. Were Amen√°bar more inspired, both as writer and director, this film could have really compelled, yet as things stand, the writing and direction is generally decent, while the performances that also supplement the film's engagement value never cease to impress, for although there's really not too much for the performers to work with, most everyone is reasonably charismatic, with standouts including the young and believable Alakina Mann (Seriously, where in the world did she go?) and, of course, leading lady Nicole Kidman, whose emotionally inspired and also believable portrayal of a stern but fearful mother faced with bizarre forces that threaten her loved ones cuts through all of the unlikable traits within the Grace Stewart character, until only a compelling lead force is left standing. As I said, the rest of the film isn't quite as compelling as its lead's performance, yet such an engaging central character gets this film by quite a bit, and with resonance and intrigue pumping this film along further, the final product emerges still quite flawed, yet generally inspired enough to engage you through all of the missteps.\r\n\r\nOverall, the film hits its cheesy occasions, but is hurt more by what it doesn't hit in the writing department, failing to product enough story dynamicity to dismiss repetition, let alone obscure the bland, minimalist story structure that Alejandro Amen√°bar, as director, executes dryly, if not dully, enough for the final product to stand as improvable, yet not so much so that it's not ultimately more engaging than not, as the art direction and production designs do a fine job of establishing claustrophobia to supplement the intrigue brought to life by Alejandro Amen√°bar, who also draws a fair bit of dramatic resonance, complimented by a reasonably memorable twist and, most of all, the charismatic performances - the most memorable of which being by young Alakina Mann and compelling leading lady Nicole Kidman - that go into making \"The Others\" an enjoyable thriller, even with its shortcomings.\r\n\r\n2.5/5 - Fair",

The story is about Grace Stewart played by Nicole Kidman who has two children named Nicholas and Anne who suffer from photo-sensitivity so therefore they have to follow certain complex rules. The children have to wait for their father since he has gone to war as the movie is set in 1945. When Anne begins to see ghosts, she is scolded by Grace for telling fantasies and strange ideas and believes that the newly arrived family of servants are responsible but when she soon starts to investigate the house herself, she changes her mind only to believe that her house is haunted. The film itself takes us into a spiral sense that makes us keep on guessing what was happening for real and what was just in our mind through out the movie which is good. People say that old movies back then like The Haunting, House On Haunted Hill and Thirteen Ghosts perfected that art well this film raised the bar to beat. But here's the thing: The Sixth Sense remains my favourite ghost movie to this day and my third favourite horror movie as well because they took time to explain strongly on the ghosts and the main characters' weaknesses revealing a huge twisted connection that they both have in the end. The Others also did that which is why it ranks up to be equally as good as The Sixth Sense. Overall The Others is a spooky thriller that I will hopefully remember forever. The Others gets a decent 10/10.",
