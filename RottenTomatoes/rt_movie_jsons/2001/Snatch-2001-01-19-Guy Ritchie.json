            "content": "Funniest film I've seen in ages!\n\nBritish director Guy Ritchie's crime comedy Snatch (2000), humorously stylized as snatch., is an insane crime comedy joyride from the mind of British writer and director Guy Ritchie. The script is non-stop hilarity with a chaotic twist. The wild edits keep the pace briskly kinetic, if disjointed. \n\nThe editing is steeped in the 1990's with frantic fast cuts that may not age well for some, but I now find them exhilarating. They fit Guy Ritchie's electric style. The nonsensical, surrealistic style is straight out of Danny Boyle's Trainspotting mixed with David Fincher's Fight Club. Snatch is not the most original movie ever made, but man, Ritchie approaches crime comedy with a zeal for violence, robbery, fist fights, and fierce swearing. Snatch is totally astonishing.\n\nThe ridiculous names and deep accents are hard to follow, especially with such a large cast of characters, but you will actually have fun listening to this aural onslaught. I recommend just turning on the subtitles to catch every crazy name and witty line of dialogue. Composer John Murphy's score is intense and varied with a darker undertone as all the action unfolds on screen. I cannot honestly take off points for the old school rock and hip hop inspired soundtrack, nor the goofy edits. Snatch is a blast from start to finish.\n\nSnatch is the best thing Guy Ritchie has ever directed. I liked Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, but Snatch elevates things to new levels of absurd incompetence of criminal activity. Ritchie takes a massive cast including Jason Statham, Brad Pitt, Benicio del Toro, Rade Serbedzija, Dennis Farina, Vinnie Jones, among others to great effect. The wild personalities match well with these eccentric characters to multiply the insanity of Snatch. Everyone is a memorable, funny tough guy character. You are just taken in by the humor and vibe.\n\nJason Statham's suave tough guy boxing promoter Turkish is funny, especially as his luck gets worse and worse. I love Statham making fun of Stephen Graham screw-up Tommy. Dennis Farina's hyper jewel fence Cousin Avi is so excellent like Mike Reid's amiable jewel appraiser Doug the Head. Nicola and Teena Collins are really hot as Doug's twin daughters Alex and Susi. Their syncopated speech is a scream!\n\nBrad Pitt steals the film as romani boxer Mickey O'Neil. His indistinguishable Irish traveler accent is amazing stuff like his resilient boxing technique. Alan Ford's disgusting dog fighter, rigged boxing match promoter, and human feeding pig owner villain Brick Top is heinous and hilarious. He's ruthless, scary, and grotesque. Ford makes use of every second he's on screen. Sorcha Cusack is super protective and charming as Mickey's mother Mrs. O'Neil. I felt so bad for her after Mickey just wanted her to have a caravan. Jason Flemyng gets a neat cameo as the other romani man Darren.\n\nRobbie Gee's Vinny in constant disbelief is a riot like Lennie James' Sol always messing up is so funny. Ade's getaway driver Tyrone is a blast alongside them. They're all so fun together. Benicio del Toro's foolish robber and hopeless gambler Franky Four-Fingers is hysterical in Snatch. Rade \u0160erbed\u017eija's underhanded mad shooter Boris the Blade is excellent and intimidating.\n\nVinnie Jones delivers one of the best monologues ever as the scary headhunter Bullet Tooth Tony. He's imposing and hilarious, especially opposite the paranoid and raving Avi. Adam Fogerty's clumsy big boxer Gorgeous George is awesome opposite Brad Pitt. Ewen Bremner's hilarious cameo as Mullet as Vinnie Jones' Tony interrogates him is possibly the funniest scene here in Snatch.\n\nIn conclusion, I cannot recommend Snatch enough! It is a highly stylized, hilarious crime comedy. The violence and swearing is just a backdrop to brilliant comedic setups and absurd payoffs. Regardless of the hard to follow plot, thick accents, chaotic edits, and ludicrous names, I think anyone would still enjoy Snatch. You will laugh throughout the nutjob visual trip that is Snatch.",

They have a mission to sell diamonds, however there are many obstacles such as a character called Errol who will have them dead if they make a mistake. Errol likes to bet on boxing matches that are of course scripted. Turkish and Tommy find a gypsy called Mickey played by Brad Pitt. This is without a doubt my favourite performance from this actor. He is a boxer who is not afraid to get hit, but hits back hard. Two main characters propose to him that he would go down in the fourth round. Mickey knocks his opponent by accident in round 1. That causes chaos.\nThe movie has a gripping plot which consists of many threads. It is easy to get lost, but you get used to a fast-flowing action. We have two main characters Turkish and Tommy, they are brothers. They are also boxing promoters. Mickey is an Irish boxer, Errol is a gangster who has aggressive dogs that eat human beings. There are many characters to name in this movie, but I think that they are the most important ones. I think that It's a must watch if you want to have a good laugh and also if you're old enough.",

Its\n\nThe sheer cockiness of the characters was somewhat amusing in and of itself and, of course, it hardly goes without saying that visually there's a decent urban style aspect to it too. Some of the dialogue is amusing, such as one line which goes 'a boxing match? is there fighting involved?' hmm, I wonder(!) *doh*. Needless to say, such lines like that aside, the majority of the comedy is dark - it has quite a menacing feel to it, as you'd expect for a gritty British/English/London based gangster film. For a film of this type, I would recommend it, yes.",

My main issue with the film, however, is the giant array of characters that don't seem as fleshed out as they probably should have been.

Snatch suffers from all of these problems and more. There's practically no coherent plot at all; it's as if it was written on set whilst they were filming. The 'main characters' weren't really main characters, the robbers were too idiotic to even be robbers, the gypsy was somehow a world champion boxer, the Russian had bulletproof skin, and so on.

Part of the fun of a Guy Ritchie film is the dialogue, even if Turkish (Jason Statham) says his partner-in-crime's name, \"Tommy\" (Stephen Graham, who always seems to play a gangster or thug of some kind) more than any actual human would. Brad Pitt gives the best performance, whether his shirt is on or off, as Mickey, an \"Irish Traveller\" armed with the proclivity to knock-out his boxing opponent with a single punch. There are far too many characters to discuss, but I don't think any plot threads needed to be clipped. That being said, there is something missing in this movie that I can't put my finger on \u2014 I know that's not a good thing to put in a review, but I'm not being paid to write these things. Turkish as the narrator didn't take anything away for me, but I happen to enjoy this sort of English accent. Other directorial decisions worth mentioning were some of the freeze-frames \u2014 especially during fight scenes \u2014 and the quick-cuts for when \"Cousin Avi\" (Dennis Farina) was flying to and from London. I did find it ridiculous that \"Bullet Tooth\" Tony (Vinnie Jones) fires no less than six shots from a desert eagle (with NO kickback, mind you) into Boris (Rade \u0160erbed\u017eija) before finally killing him. The ending put a smile on my face, which is saying something considering my open hostility toward gypsies. Watch for the thrills, but be warned, you might start speaking in an accent like you'd just returned home from studying abroad.",

Tarantino does a similar thing to what Ritchie does here, yet for him, it all seems very real even when something witty is said. In Snatch, it feels forced, and planned. A film should not show that it has been planned, it should try to feel as organic as possible. This is the main area that this film falls behind on. However, It's a very fun picture to watch, and is very decently written, and the direction adds to the excitement. I like it, you probably will too.",

They play eccentric, sometimes unforgettable and sometimes bumbling characters, which really makes the movie feel alive. \nSnatch also has another signature trait of Ritchie's, which is that it tells a plot which interestingly interlocks a lot. It's quite similar to his previous Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998), although Snatch is much superior. It's a better and more polished twist to the precedent film. \nOverall, this is a very enjoyable, fun, stylish and violent enough crime/comedy. \nOverall, I really enjoyed Snatch. It's a classic.

You've got A-list stars in unusual roles (Brad Pitt as the near-incomprehensible \u2018pikey' boxer) and exactly the roles you'd expect them to play (Jason Statham as the collected boxing promoter), but the real stars are less prominent today: Alan Ford gives a genuinely great performance as intimidating and unpredictable gangster Brick Top and Vinnie Jones steals every scene he's in as Bullet-Tooth Tony.

To Ritchie's credit, when his brand of craziness works, it is really funny. The only saving grace for me is Hugh Grant's performance \u2013 he is hilarious as a paparazzi-type character who has his own objectives related to the marijuana business.

The wild edits keep the pace brisk, if disjointed. I wish the edits were less steeped in the 1990's as many have not aged well.The nonsensical, surrealistic style is straight out of Danny Boyle's Trainspotting mixed with David Fincher's Fight Club. Snatch is not the most original movie ever made, but man, it is so much fun.\n\nThe ridiculous names and deep accents are hard to follow, especially with such a large cast of characters, but you will actually have fun listening to this aural onslaught. John Murphy's score is intense and varied with a darker undertone as all the action unfolds on screen. I cannot honestly take off points for the old school rock and hip hop inspired soundtrack, nor the goofy edits. Snatch is a blast from start to finish.\n\nSnatch is the best thing Guy Ritchie has ever directed. He takes a massive cast including Jason Statham, Brad Pitt, Benicio del Toro, Rade Serbedzija, Dennis Farina, Vinnie Jones, among others to great effect. The wild personalities match well with these eccentric characters to multiple the insanity of Snatch. Everyone is a memorable, fun character. You are just taken in by the humor and vibe.\n\nI cannot recommend Snatch enough. It is a highly stylized, hilarious comedy. The violence and swearing is just a backdrop to brilliant comedic setups and payoffs. Regardless of the hard to follow plot, accents, edits, and names, I think anyone would still enjoy Snatch. You will laugh throughout the nuts visual trip that is Snatch.",

            "content": "I was literally on the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie; every single scene I found very riveting, every single character I was very interested in, and every joke, and one-liner hits the mark. But I kept wondering all the way through the movie if I really understand what's going on, and that's exactly the single issue I've with Snatch.\n\nIt has an unbelievably convoluted plot, and redundant characters. There are a lot of characters, which I really cared about each one of them, and every character, or rather every bunch of characters has their own sub-plot that's, for better or worse, miraculously intertwined with the very main plot.\n\nIt's quite puzzling that what I consider as a flaw is somehow resulted in, or caused by, a merit that was a main reason for keeping me captivated, hence a main reason for making me extremely love this movie. And the result is while it's impossible for me to ignore how confusing, and perplexing I found this movie, there are plenty of things that more than enough to make up for that.\n\nFirst things first, this movie is immensely enjoyable! there is no scene or moment that I felt the movie dragged even a little bit, and that's due Ritchie's brilliant direction, and twisting script. The very British humor here is at its finest. It's all thanks to the perfect comic timing that is at its very best, the quick-cut and comedic editing, and the genius use of the already killer soundtrack.\nYou also can see very obviously how Edgar Wright took, and developed this style, and made it his own.\n\nThe characters, aside from portrayed by a stellar cast, especially Brad Pitt who stole the show as the Gypsy, Mickey O'Neil who you can barely understand a single word he says, they play a major part of the humor. Guy Ritchie found a fine line for his characters between being sympathetic and blameworthy. Once you will find yourself root for a character, and at another time you will wish this character gets harm very badly for the sake of some laughs, because Ritchie made you know very well that when things go wrong for the characters it's never so serious, and you would get some laughs from what you would never expect.\n\nThe brisk dialogue serves the humor as well, but it also flesh out the characters. Many people think Guy Ritchie tried so hard to be like Tarantino, but I totally disagree with that opinion. Yes he used the dialogue that seems to add nothing to the story, and the non-linear storytelling, but he used them in his own way, and with his very exceptional style. The non-linear storytelling felt unnecessary, though.\n\nThe last reason why I can partially forgive the excessive number of characters and sub-plots is that when I reached the very end of the movie, I found that I was actually got the story easily, and understood almost everything. That being said, this, in itself, emphasizes that this movie is a bit hollow, and it displays many details that don't necessarily add to the main plot. Which I found crazy, just like the movie itself!\n\n(8/10)",

I also always appreciate films that portray the less sophisticated sides of England - one of the few things I liked about, say, Brothers Grimsby.\n\nBut the plot is difficult to follow and ultimately inconsequential, there is some very uncool language and regressive attitudes, and frankly even ugly camera work (though with typically 'badass' Ritchie editing).

            "content": "I love how calm and uneventful it was when the four Jewish guys were entering the building and then as soon as they got to the room, everything just exploded stylistically in sound and visuals - all over the top. I thought it was hilarious. This has Ocean's Eleven vibes written all over it. I love the style in which they introduce all the characters. It reminded me of a fun action-packed shooter game. I don't know anything about any of these characters, but I'm interested to see how all their stories are intertwined. \n\nJason Stratham has a surprisingly great sense of comedy, I wasn't really expecting that from him. I always thought of him as the typical action guy from movies like Transporter and Crank. Funny how Brick Top, the four-eyed mobster that deals in illegal boxing matches and dog fights, has a pig farm and has to deal with pig poop. He seems like a pretty despicable and terrible human being, ruthless as well. I thought that Doug the Head deciding to be Jewish because he thinks it'll help his diamond business out was the most ridiculously funny thing. I can barely understand anything of what Brad Pitt's character, Mickey, is saying, but my god look at those abs. I love how \u2018Golden Brown' by The Stranglers starts playing when Mickey knocks out Gorgeous George and then it continues to play when they show Tommy crying - that whole sequence was beautiful. This song has been following me everywhere for the past couple of days and all I can say is, \"Golden Brown texture like Sun, Lays me down with my mind she runs\". I absolutely love this song. I love how the Pikey's always throw in a dog with whatever deal they make lmao. \n\nThe characters in this movie are almost like cartoons or a caricaturization of a person, it's so good. I really hope Brick Top gets what's coming to him. I can't believe he burned down Mickey's mum's caravan while she was still asleep in it. The one scene where Bullet Tooth is at the pub explaining he has a Desert Eagle and goes to take a sip of his beer and then Ghost Town starts to play, almost seems like it was heavily inspired for the beginning of Shaun of the Dead. I had a feeling Mickey and the Pikey's were gonna have a plan of their own to get revenge for what Brick Top did and sure enough, they did. They even pulled it off brilliantly and cunningly. Brick Top's an idiot for thinking that Mickey wasn't going to have some sort of revenge plan cooked up. I guess he thought he was untouchable, serves him right. I love how they tied everything up really nicely at the end there. \n\nThe movie's very simple in it's approach with style, but it works fantastically since Guy Ritchie knew exactly what he wanted to do. It also helps that the pacing and editing are flawless. There's never a dull or boring moment, the movie glides along real nicely, especially given everything that's thrown at you. The soundtrack is top tier. Some of my favorite songs actually make it in the movie. It goes from Golden Brown to Ghost Town by The Specials. I mean come on, you can't get any better than that. And then they play Angel by Massive Attack later on and it pairs amazingly well with the scenes being shown. This movie's hilariously entertaining and fun. Very cleverly written and brilliantly crafted by Guy, this movie's brimming with life. A lot of the dialogue and lines are unforgettably quotable like, \"Got anything to declare?\", \"Yeah, don't go to England\". There was definitely a couple of things that reminded me of Edgar Wright's visual style that I loved seeing, like the fast cuts showing things in order and just the overall visual style of humor. Guy Ritchie's visual style is exhilarating, exciting and kinetic with movement. The only thing that kind of bothers me a bit about this movie, and a lot of movies that came out around the same time, is the muted colors. For some reason during that time, it was the trendy thing to do and I don't know why. But honestly, it doesn't take away from the movie at all. \n\nOverall, Snatch was an incredibly fun and wildly entertaining movie with plenty of depth in its characters and a banger story to boot. I'll be watching this one again for a good time and I'll definitely be recommending it to everyone.",

            "content": "I can't remember ever experiencing anything like what happened while I watched Snatch. I started out completely puzzled by the story and befuddled by who the characters were and how they fit together. But just as I was about to get a little irritated, suddenly stories started to intersect. Then the laughs started to flow, and I was catching onto what was happening. Out of nowhere, not only did I know and connect with all the characters, but I was fully invested in what would happen next. I just love the way that the story is told with a lot of separate little scenes that intersect, but you don't realize they are connected until you see it from all the different perspectives. The final scenes which bring everything full circle are the kind of moments that make me want to stand up and applaud even when I'm watching by myself on a DVD. Snatch is a really great script and is executed very well. I can see myself watching it again, now that I know the ending, and picking up on all kinds of little things I missed the first time. The cast is really great, and I was particularly surprised by Brad Pitt just disappearing into that accent to the point where I started to forget who I was watching. Guy Ritchie has a particular style/look to his films that I thought suited this story really well, although it threatens to be distracting in some cases. Perhaps the strangest choice was the narration over just a handful of the scenes with Jason Statham. Because of the fragmented way the story was told, it seemed odd to have only his scenes where we are given that narration to make sense of the story. It seems like they would have gone with full narration on all the stories, or none at all. It wasn't a big detriment to the film, but it was an unusual choice. Still, I quite loved watching Snatch, and would recommend it highly to others.",

            "content": "After stealing an 86-carat (17.2 g) diamond in a heist in Antwerp, Franky \"Four-Fingers\" (Benicio del Toro) goes to London to see diamond dealer Doug \"The Head\" (Mike Reid) on behalf of New York jeweler Abraham \"Cousin Avi\" Denovitz (Dennis Farina). One of the other robbers advises Franky to obtain a gun from ex-KGB agent Boris \"The Blade\" Yurinov (Rade erbedija). Unbeknownst to Franky, Boris and the robber are brothers and plan to steal the diamond from him before he can turn it over to Doug. Meanwhile, boxing promoter and slot machine shop owner Turkish (Jason Statham) convinces gangster \"Brick Top\" (Alan Ford) to put boxer \"Gorgeous George\" in a matchup against one of Brick Top's boxers. However, when Turkish sends his partner Tommy (Stephen Graham) and Gorgeous George to purchase a caravan from a group of Irish Travellers, George gets into a fight with Mickey O'Neil (Brad Pitt), a bare-knuckle boxing champion who badly injures George. Turkish convinces Mickey to replace George in his upcoming match by agreeing to purchase a new caravan for Mickey's mother. Brick Top agrees to the change on the condition that Mickey throws the fight in the fourth round. Boris gives Franky a revolver in exchange for a favour: Franky is to place a bet on Boris' behalf at Brick Top's bookies. Avi, knowing Franky has a gambling problem, flies to London with his bodyguard \"Rosebud\" to claim the diamond personally. Boris hires Vinny (Robbie Gee) and Sol (Lennie James), two small-time crooks, to rob Franky while he is at the bookies. The robbery goes awry and Sol, Vinny, and their driver Tyrone are caught on-camera, but manage to kidnap Franky.\nInstead of throwing the fight, Mickey knocks his opponent out with a single punch. Infuriated, Brick Top robs Turkish of his savings and demands that Mickey fight again, and lose this time. Meanwhile, Boris retrieves the diamond and murders Franky with a pistol. Brick Top tracks down Sol, Vinny, Tyrone, and their friend, Yardie \"Bad Boy\" Lincoln and plans on killing them for robbing his bookies. Sol bargains for their lives by promising Brick Top the stolen diamond, and is given 48 hours to retrieve it. Avi and Doug hire \"Bullet-Tooth\" Tony (Vinnie Jones) to help them find Franky. Things go from bad to worse and the plot thickens while the bunch of rag tag characters cross each other with violent results... \n\nGuy Ritchie\u00b4s \"Snatch\" was largely successful, both in critical response and financial gross, and has gone on to develop a devoted cult following. \"Snatch\" also appears on Empire magazine's 2008 poll of the 500 greatest movies of all time at number 466. While the film received mostly positive reviews, several reviewers commented negatively on perceived similarities in plot, character, setting, theme and style between \"Snatch\" and Ritchie's previous work, \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\". In his review, Roger Ebert, who gave the film two out of four stars, raised the question of \"What am I to say of 'Snatch', Ritchie's new film, which follows the 'Lock, Stock' formula so slavishly it could be like a new arrangement of the same song?\", and writing in the New York Times Elvis Mitchell commented that \"Mr. Ritchie seems to be stepping backward when he should be moving ahead\". Critics also argued that the movie was lacking in depth and substance; many reviewers appeared to agree with Ebert's comment that \"the movie is not boring, but it doesn't build and it doesn't arrive anywhere\". Movie Room Reviews gave the movie four stars and said \"there is no movie quite like it\". Yes, you can only agree to the fact that Guy Ritchie followed slavishly his crime comedy formula created with \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\" but I don\u00b4t see the big issue here. The formula worked in \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\" as in \"Snatch\" and as well in \"Rock N Rolla\". The dialogue is funny and rememberable, the story is filled with well known actors and strange characters (gotta love Brad Pitt\u00b4s Mickey O'Neil), the simple plotline is enriched with so many great situations and scenes, there\u00b4s plenty of great visual solutions and set ups and the soundtrack adds so much to the film. Yes, it a bit messy in the direction, there\u00b4s a bit too many characters, it\u00b4s very stereotypical and the story is more or less written in three lines. But, Ritchie manages to piece together the one-liners, sarcastic jokes, humour, twists and strange character's & events to something that is entertaining no matter what. \"Snatch\" is stylish, fast paced and has an interesting  take on the crime comedy genre. Trivia: The role of Brick Top was originally offered to Sean Connery. Connery liked the script and was curious to see \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\" (1998), so producer Matthew Vaughn hastily arranged a screening for him at extreme short notice. Connery duly turned up and watched the film, before emerging with his judgment: \"That is a good film\", he said, \"and (in a stage whisper) you're not going to be able to afford me.\"",

            "content": "The legacy of Quentin Tarantino was at its most illustrious in the mid-to-late '90s, when copycats and swag-jackers still didn't seem like such - then, his career was too young to make his filmmaking obsessions iconic in the way they are now.  And so rounds of movies similar in nature to his \"Pulp Fiction,\" such as Doug Liman's ingenious \"Go\" (1999) and Steven Soderbergh's indelible \"Out of Sight,\" set the stage for a cinematic land where sly comic thrillers with tangled plots and colorful characters could be more glowing in the eyes of the public than the Arnie moneymakers of the 1980s could ever be.\n\tOver the years, critics and audiences alike have noted that only one filmmaker has really emulated Tarantino's '90s with the same sort of ambitious spunk - he is, of course, Guy Ritchie, whose uncanny ability to squeeze laughs out of criminal buffoonery and whose deft balance of multiple characters and storylines has made him an icon in the grand scheme of renowned Generation X pulp. \n\tUnseen by me, his 1999 debut, \"Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels,\" has become a minor classic, seen as the best Tarantino wannabe of the decade simply because it strove for genuine caper jitters rather than stooping to rip-off filler like expected.  Its soundtrack and tonal vibrations made for chatter that suggested Quentin and Robert would be in for some major cinematic competition.\n\tSo before 2002's \"Swept Away\" shut down the buzz that surrounded his budding filmography, working as a widely panned vanity project featuring then-wife Madonna in a role that proved that she wasn't anything even resembling a decent actress, he furthered the fever that surrounded \"Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels\" with 2001's \"Snatch.\" A stylistically matching comic thriller characterized by a serpentine plot, truckloads of characters, and dialogue ready to burst with kooky comedic slickness, it never, for a second, lets us lose interest.\n\tThe story, though meant to be the sort of plot that seems complicated but somehow fuses together seamlessly, is supremely hard to follow, but that doesn't mean that the situations that arise aren't confidently set.  It involves a sought after diamond always ready to fall into the wrong hands, whether it be the palms of businessmen Turkish (Jason Statham) and Tommy (Stephen Graham), who are in the process of making a deal with a sadistic gang leader (Alan Ford), or Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro) and his dim-witted associates, who are employed under American jewel dealer Cousin Avi (Dennis Farina).\n\tHowever likable and funny it may be, \"Snatch\" has a difficult time tying its interweaving stories in the same breathless way Tarantino so easily can, with too many faces and names to really keep track of; without a Bruce Willis or Uma Thurman to act as heavyweight markers detonating where the story is going, it all feels rather aimless, even when it's inspired.  At least the performances, ranging from truly fearsome to fantastically funny (particularly Statham's smart-ass portrayal or Brad Pitt's almost incomprehensibly accented Mickey), keep us entertained, and at least Ritchie has a knack for natural comedy - we sometimes forget that we have no idea what's really happening.\n\tBut I am in awe of \"Snatch's\" inexhaustibility - Ritchie seems to have an immeasurable assembly line of criminal-based comedic scenarios to throw at us, and he's a writer, a director, with extraordinary enthusiasm for his craft.  So however flawed it is, \"Snatch\" is a great deal of fun, and Ritchie never lets us forget it.",

The characters are just as memorable as his debut movie, and Guy Ritchie still got the Quentin Tarantino snappy dialogue that has a lot of dark humor moments. The acting is great with highlights from Jason Statham, Vinnie Jones, Brad Pitt, Dennis Farina, and the dog who also gave some funny moments which makes it more funny with the situations that the dog had to go through. The plot is a bit out there and kind of feels like it's getting nowhere at times. It has a lot of style, more than his film debut which some people would think it's style over substance. Snatch may feel similar to Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, but it still has the same entertaining value and great writing.",

The comic tone is more risqu\u00c3\u00a9, confident and richly enjoyed than in the earlier film. The knowing macho heroics, pubwise patter, tongue in cheek ethnic comparisons, locations and designer violence are balanced with a showman's bravado, fending off offensiveness with neat reversals, little ironies and hyperbolic buffoonery.\u00c2\u00a0",

This movie is suppose to confuse you and it works and it's suppose to because that's whats it going for. But then it perfectly builds up to the grand end. I love the direction and it had a lot of similarities to sherlock and not fightclub as some people say. I loved every single character in it for try all had a different personality in it. Especially brad Pitts character and I think this is his best work. Guy Ritchie is probably one of my favorites and I have only seen 3 of his movies. Overall from the story to its acting this is a must see.",
