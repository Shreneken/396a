    "summary": "Police drama about a veteran officer who escorts a rookie on his first day with the LAPD's tough inner-city narcotics unit. \"Training Day\" is a blistering action drama that asks the audience to decide what is necessary, what is heroic and what crosses the line in the harrowing gray zone of fighting urban crime. Does law-abiding law enforcement come at the expense of justice and public safety? If so, do we demand safe streets at any cost?",

Denzel felt truly bone chilling in this, and I felt tons of empathy for Ethan Hawk's good cop character getting mixed up with Denzel.  The human emotions in here are quite believable.

With each encounter he shows us a different approach.  Hawke is mediocre as the white-bread rookie but Glenn and singers Macy Gray, Snoop Dog, and Dr. Dre make the most of small roles.

I kept waiting for a reason to change the opinion that the first act puts to you regarding him but it never came, there's never a point I cared for him and I assume I was supposed to... at least to some degree? Also, his issue is thrown at you in one scene and isn't really mentioned again until the end. I get the character, just not his arc.\n\nEthan Hawke is very good, too, in this, even if I kept hearing Tom Cruise when he spoke... You also have a load of now familiar faces involved, including Eva Mendes, Raymond Cruz, Cliff Curtis, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and Terry Crews. Quite an interesting cast list, that.\n\nLoved all of this, except the (still good) plot execution. Maybe that's just me though. From what I've seen, Washington's best performance so far.

Someone who took an oath to Protect & Serve. He is the embodiment of abuse of power, encapsulated in the lingering effects of hundreds of years of oppression, racial injustice and deposited into the inner city streets where we were regulated to dwell in with the expectation that we would eventually exterminate ourselves like primitive beasts. Who else to lead the beasts to slaughter but one of their own? Denzel Washington’s portrayal of Detective Alonzo Harris deserves the Oscar victory because we witnessed the greatest and probably most underrated performance in motion picture history. This was his Citizen Kane. If not your choice, it definitely, definitively and defiantly is mine as the greatest movie of my lifetime. Encore. -xAnderSpeaks ",

It is a rough film about a young rookie being thrown into the deep end with a crooked narcotics officer. I was not surprised at all by what the movie delivered on a thematic level, except for the shocking fact that I found myself enjoying it. Despite my aversion to gritty crime dramas, this one has something special that set it apart from others. There are a number of clever turns this movie takes which I didn’t see coming, and I wanted to applaud the writer and director for being so clever. It’s well-thought-out in almost every way, and takes you on a roller coaster of excitement. My one complaint about the plot is that I couldn’t piece together the value of bringing along the rookie for all of these things. Alonzo goes through a lot to put the right dominoes in place for this kid to be there, but it seems he could have pulled all this off the day before, without needing to worry about the new guy. Denzel Washington deserved the Oscar for this performance, because he fully embraces the villainous cop role. Some might say that it was such an evil character that he lacked any nuance, but I’d heartily disagree because he goes through stages where you think he can be trusted, or you think he is so likable that he might have a heart of gold underlying his schemes. Ethan Hawke was appropriately shaken and uncomfortable through most of the movie, and his transition into the final act was done quite well. Training Day is a movie that keeps moving at a breakneck pace, and rarely gives you time to relax. They might have stuffed an unreasonably large amount of activity into this one day, but I was willing to suspend my disbelief because the plot wouldn’t have worked if they went home at any point. Overall, while it’s not a genre I typically enjoy, Training Day rises above its genre and proves itself to be something special. I would like to watch it again now, knowing how all the pieces fall into place.",

His character arc is one of rule bending cop to out-and-out criminal with a badge. \n\nDr. Dre and Snoop Dog have minor roles but show they have acting chops as well. They join a talented supporting cast that help set the atmosphere of a Los Angeles you don't see on tourist maps. \n\nA few minor problems include the shoot out in broad daylight that seems to have zero consequences despite the fact they drive around in a car riddled with bullet holes. The Russian mob angle also seems like a convenient plot device tacked on to an otherwise solid storyline. \n\nAltogether a movie worth watching and watching again.

And while Ethan Hawke is undoubtedly very good, it's really Denzel Washington thats gives, which may possibly be, his most memorable and powerful, excellent performance, no wonder he won an Academy award for his act. Overall, this is an entertaining, suspenseful and gripping movie, and one of the best crime flicks of the 2000s. Recommended!!",

Dealing with systematic corruption in the police force, crime investigation, drug dealing, bribery, and ethics. Training Day is a visceral sprint into law enforcement. Training Day forces you right into the position of a rookie cop asking yourself what would you honestly do in the same situation. \n\nIt is brilliant due to David Ayer's clever and complex script alongside Fuqua's innovative and gritty direction. Training Day is timeless thanks to its commentary on police corruption and our contemporary police brutality problem. I think everyone needs to see Training Day.\n\nDenzel Washington is the real star as he comes across as the most real and selfish cop ever put on screen. His violence, anger, and ingenuity are met with his display of likability, experience, and results. Washington portrays a man of deeply held convictions that poses as a good cop to fool all those around him. Washington earned that Oscar for real. You will absolutely despise his character by the end.\n\nNotably, Ethan Hawke is the everyman rookie cop that we are meant to empathize with from the very first scene. We are along for the ride right by Hawke's side and he plays it wonderfully. From the naive well wisher that does not understand the streets to the honest cop that does the right thing, Hawke pulls off a very relatable performance in Training Day. He plays off of Washington's outgoing psychopath very convincingly down to the last. I like Hawke in Training Day quite a bit.\n\nI must mention there are so many neat cameo and supporting roles scattered throughout Training Day. From Scott Glenn, Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, Eva Mendes, and Terry Crews. Training Day's cast is wild. Everyone is realistic and feels a part of this horrid world of crime and corruption.\n\nIn all, Antoine Fuqua did a phenomenal job directing Training Day. It has aged well with the same intensity as when it first released in theaters. Training Day is still shocking and visceral down to the last moment. This is a brutal ride along for the books, but well worth the watch.",

Antonie Fuqua is in his A game and doesn't disappoint at any frame of the feature holding the audience with wide open eyes for 2 complete hours.

It's a defining performance by Washington and a breakthrough role for Hawke. The film is imbued with memorable quotes that have withstood the test of time, even all these years later. \"King Kong ain't got @#£% on me\" still resonates with me as one of these most memorable quotes. An all star cast, great action, accompanied by a series of moral dilemmas and an extremely satisfying ending make this a cult classic that has to be seen at least once. That being said, it has that rare quality in films that allows you to watch it multiple times yet still be entertained. Love this film. It has depth and doesn't shy away from exposing some dark truths in modern life. There are some subtleties there too that actually bypassed me on first viewing. For example, the newscaster's version of the events that unfolded around Alonso, at the end of the movie, provide a very interesting take on what actually took place and add further to the portrayal of a somewhat dubious policing department on an ethical level. Faultless and extremely enjoyable.",

            "content": "Much as 2001's \"Training Day\" goes to great lengths to create a gritty atmosphere that evokes an authentic, kitchen sink real sort of danger, I can't quite shake the feeling that not a thing about it is as pragmatic as director Antoine Fuqua might want you to believe.  (If only because it goes to zero to sixty so quickly that things start to seem more blatantly cinematic than menacingly street smart.)  But when its believability falters, its actors pick up the pieces and set their surroundings on fire, and since the film hardly finds a single moment not plagued by visceral danger, they're all \"Training Day\" has to convince us that in front of us is more than a bunch of lip-smacking tough talk.\n\tEthan Hawke, young and ambitious, stars as Jake Hoyt, an LAPD officer in the process of working his way up to the top of the narcotics sector of the conglomerate.  The film follows the twenty-four-period during which he's evaluated for possible promotion by Detective Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington), a highly respected narcotics commissioner.  Though Hoyt expects nothing more than a routine excursion, a few hours of perusing through the streets with a couple of forays into deep-rooted, down and dirty preparation, little can ready him for the living hell that is working alongside Harris.\n\tTo Harris, a successful officer must stoop to the levels of the criminals they're arresting - violence should always be one's first instinct, and thievery is a treat to be taken advantage of.  Consuming confiscated drugs are not out of the question.  \n\tMost in Hoyt's situation would perhaps instantaneously jump out of Harris's car in order to avoid getting themselves into a stew of a legal mess, but the former wants nothing more than to serve his community to the best of his ability.  If he has to wiggle around the constraints of his moral standards in order to do so, so be it.\n\tBut as the day treads along and Harris's detours into supposed crime fighting get increasingly hazardous and increasingly embedded in perilous self-interest, Hoyt cannot help himself from questioning if letting loose for the sake of building a career is really worth it - or if traveling down deep into the underbellies in which Harris commits most of his wrongdoings are good places to go for shady intrigue.\n\tThe film eventually explodes into a finale that serves as even more of an all-too-simple letdown a la \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" (only we're given the opposite of a life or death bromance).  But because all leading up to it is so scrumptiously savage, I can excuse screenwriter David Ayer's decision to move toward an easy-way-out wrap up.  It's more \"Sleuth\" than \"Dirty Harry,\" and conversation, ambience, and swagger are definitively more important than a story that sings in its naturalism.\n\tBut that's also my largest lament.  \"Training Day\" is too operatic for a movie that's supposed to essentially work as a near docudrama regarding police brutality and corruption.  Its biggest strength - and biggest weakness - is Alonzo Harris, who is played by Washington with astonishing intensity.  While a fascinating creation of bureaucratic evil, Harris proves to have the dimension of a 1960s Bond villain, all cackling maleficence without a trace of humanization.  The role is beautifully performed, but I much prefer Hawke's Hoyt, who's genuinely portrayed as a big-eyed hopeful way in over his head.\n\t\"Training Day\" flourishes, though, in creating a world so riddled with crime and hopelessness that the sneaking sensation of fear becomes a given.  In order to authenticate its setting, Fuqua insisted many of the movie's scenes be shot in the most treacherous streets of Los Angeles, and the inducing of a rough riding ghetto is lucid.  But because the material is more overwrought than snakily dangerous, we never forget that we're watching a movie and not a true crime explosion, and for a film so intent on making a statement, that's a fatal flaw.",

            "content": "What makes a good movie villain? An intimidating presence certainly helps, as does a solid motivation for their devious deeds. Perhaps they're seeking revenge for a past event in their life. Maybe they're hungry for power, and will stop at nothing to become supreme. Or maybe their just anarchists, plain and simple. But, most of all, a good villain is one that's believable, and one that anyone could become under certain circumstances.\n\nSuch is the distinguishing quality of Alonzo Harris, the main antagonist of Antoine Fuqua's Training Day. The complex relationship between Alonzo and Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) highlights why Alonzo is so utterly terrifying: Alonzo's actions constantly jump from being understandable in this grimy Los Angeles environment to being pushed beyond the line of morality. As Hoyt jumps from trusting Alonzo to not trusting him, we do the same. How can we side with someone profiting off of innocents, often with no regard to their lives? But he's a family man and an established cop: surely he's trustworthy. It's quite a fascinating dynamic that writer David Ayer has crafted up here.\n\nOf course, it helps that such a complex character has a talented actor like Denzel Washington behind him. In an Oscar winning performance, Washington goes full-on antagonist, a kind of performance we rarely see from him, and a quality that makes the character dynamic that much more effective. Perhaps he camps it up at times, but Washington's charisma is too infectious to be bothered by any campiness. Alongside him is one of the finest performances from Ethan Hawke. Hawke really sells the struggle of the rookie cop in over his head, and his transformation from rookie to hardened cop is a fantastic showcase for his acting chops.\n\nBehind the camera, Antoine Fuqua directs with an appropriate amount of grit and unrelenting tension. Every scene is wound like a guitar string: with nobody to truly trust, you're left with an increasing heart rate as you prepare for the inevitable snap. It's rare for a film to go from zero to sixty so quickly and keep that pace consistent throughout a two hour runtime, but Fuqua does it with impeccable ease. A quintessential crime thriller.",

We get to observe these two very different people (the idealistic Jake and the cynical Alonzo) laugh, argue, help, and betray each other over the course of a single day and it makes for a truly great character study.

The story does an excellent job of keeping you on your toes. I've seen this film so many times now and I get tensed up in so many scenes. You get so invested in the characters and story that you can't help but be tense. No spoilers, but this has one of the most intense climaxes of any film I've ever seen. The stakes, the emotion behind the characters, the acting, the screen direction, I'm surprised that this climax isn't studied in film schools. Although I recommend this film to everyone, It shouldn't be watched for the faint of heart. If you can't stand any violence or dark subject matter in your films, then this film can be a lot to handle. On the other hand, if you are interested in seeing good movies... YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE! In my Top 5 for sure!",

It is a rare occurrence for playing a negative role, but I think this might be one of his best performances. Ethan Hawke also does a good job portraying his character but it is tough to notice much when Washington is alongside him. The movie has a unique premise and a lot of different things happen. The movie builds up well and kept my interest. I found myself on the edge of my seat and anxiously waiting for what would happen next. It certainly isn't a conventional action movie as it has many big ideas. If you're a fan of Denzel Washington, you can't miss this one. ",

            "content": "Earning Denzel Washington his second Academy Award, Training Day sounded like an intense thriller. \n\nOne of the first scenes in Training Day depicts the chemistry between the main two characters. The first interaction between Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke says everything about the characters' position of power. Denzel Washington's commanding line delivery comes to him at a swift rate while his higher status signifies that he is the one calling the shots. Ethan Hawke on the other hand has to think about everything he says and how to word it, tripping over his language in the process. He projects a feeling of vulnerability which contrasts Denzel Washington's fearlessness. By clarifying the relationship between the main characters early on, Training Day immediately signifies their importance to the narrative. And by doing it with such rich dialogue, the scene flows along very smoothly. \nThis anchors a strong beginning for Training Day and isolates that characters are of key importance to the overall narrative. The characters are made to keep audiences captivated throughout the film and draw their attention away from some of the more formulaic aspects of the feature. It is worth noting that Training Day rises above the standard of the average crime thriller on the basis of its realism. In living up to its title, Training Day provides an accurate portrait of becoming a narc through capturing the intense nature of the street violence that comes with the job. Though the film is not a gun-toting action feature, Training Day finds ways to work realistic violence into the narrative without using the violence as a gimmick. It is used for key points in the character development and providing viewers a full perspective on the harsh reality of the job, helping to ensure the film maintains an intense atmosphere in its journey. Everything in Training Day carries a strong sense of style as the on-location scenery captures the gritty feeling of the crime world perfectly while the cinematography makes an effective use of intense close-ups during the slow burning scenes and wide-angled shots that help to contextualize the narrative. Antoine Fuqua's sense of style helps to keep Training Day engagin on a material level. And as the story develops onwards, we progressively see more of Alonzo Harris' corrupt activities and begin to clearly understand that he has something to hind. We are aware of some unsavoury intentions with his misuse of power which becomes more clear as the story goes on, but ultimately there are also a few issues in the credibility of the plotting which weakens the experience. \nWhen the result proves to be that he is simply collecting funds to pay off a hit from the Russian mob after killing one of their members, it really reflects poorly on the rest of the story. Not only does it prove to be a rather unsatisfactory twist, but it signifies that Alonzo Harris is not the fearless officer he claims to be as he is succesfully intimidated by someone. It's understandable that someone who takes such a carless approach to killing would be a coward at heart, but the way Training Day depicts this comes off as a little too simplistic. The errors in this plot point cobbled with the fact that everything in the film happens within a singular day which Alonzo Harris has been plotting out for a supposed week really proves hard to swallow. When the film comes to its conclusion and we see Alonzo Harris' neighbourhood no longer willing to submit to his demands despite the fact that we have little understanding of his status within the community outside of the assumption that he walks all over them as a collective group. Training Day has some strong characters but also relies on formula to carry itself while the gimmicks regarding the characters are a diversion. The extent of appreciation viewers find in the performances will determine just how much of a diversion, but it's hard to deny that much of the film follows a loose narrative. Since actual development towards the climax plays out predominantly in a series of sporadic plot points while everything around it exists mainly just to contextualize life on the streets, the overall development of the narrative is inconsistent due to its structure. At times, Training Day can't help but feel like an anthology narrative which is tied together by an exceedingly loose string. The film functions well for the quality of each individual scene, but the consclusion certifies that actual story development is not one of the film's stronger qualities.\nIt's strongest quality is undeniably the entire reason audiences came to see Training Day in the first place; the leading effort of Denzel Washington. Denzel Washington has built a career out of portraying heroes. These range from John W. Creasy in Man on Fire (2004) to the titular civil rights activist in Spike Lee's Malcolm X (1992). In Training Day, he goes completely against type and takes on the role of corrupt officer Alonzo Harris, taking on all kinds of different personas in the process. At first glimpse he is a man of intimidating status and high ranking who has a commanding tenacity over his words, and later he raises the stakes through becoming unpredictable in where he will draw the lines. As the story gets deeper into the motives of Alonzo Harris, we see a deeper and darker side of Denzel Washington than anyone could have predicted. Denzel Washington is striking for his pure unpredictability in Training Day, and every slight change in his character's mood is taken to the full extent by the actor's extensively focused talents. Everything the man says could very well be a lie, and trying to figure out the truth behind the character is one of the most engaging things about the film. Denzel Washington grasps his leading performance in Training Day with full force, being merciless with his manipulation of the character. The man even turns it around at the climactic ending where he reveals who the character really is beneath his badge and his gun, becoming raw in the process. Denzel Washington adds multiple dimensions to the character Alonzo Harris in Training Day, and he keeps up with the segmented narrative by making it work to the benefit of his versatility as an actor.\nEthan Hawke also battles to make an engaging presence, proving with excellence just how strongly he can hold his own up against Denzel Washington. Though submissive and naive at the start of the film, Ethan Hawke provides the audience perspective on the story as we view the events almost entirely through his eyes. He proves consistently intense as a police office, while effectively balancing the developed fear and anger within his character. The development of his relationship with Denzel Washington elicits some incredibly intense chemistry where the consistent changes in ther interaction test out how diverse Ethan Hawke can truly be. Luckily enough he is not only up to the challenge, but he absolutely hones the role. Ethan Hawke contributes one of the finest performances of his career to Training Day, and the level of gritty intensity in his most powerful moments are a true testament to the full power of the actor.\nSnoop Dogg's cameo is a perfectly convincing appearance as is Dr. Dre's, and the fact that the two hip-hop collaborators appear within the same film is strong fan service. Cliff Curtis also delivers a memorably intense scene where his raw antagonism makes a strong impact.\n\nTraining Day may have a rather segmented story structure which interferes with the overall feeling of development, but with Antoine Fuqua's brilliant sense of style and a pair of remarkable performances from Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke, the film delivers some powerfully engaging thrills.",

Denzel and Hawke have the chemistry to a standard that not many can provide so swiftly and with visceral meaning. Point to Avery for the script coming from a fast paced style with this happening and that happening keeps you entertained,and never to wonder when is this gonna end. Academys were in order for Denzel,and he rightfully won. He showed what a ruthless shady SOB can be with great intrigue and really showed what crooked means to a cop like him. This movie is well made,great performances,good story equals it to be a solid piece of filmmaking not great cinema. It cleared a way for Fuqua to see what he could do.",

This film is very original, because it's about a brutal cop tricking his partner into letting him get away with all of these illegal things. This film was a little slow, but was intense throughout.

It had a lot of violence, and brutality. It was intense throughout, and it was definitely a film that will give you a massive adrenaline rush. Especially during the last half hour. So brutal, and intense. \nDenzel Washington really stunned me with his performance, because he was so brutal, evil, and you just hate him so much. His entire plan to get all of the money, and to blackmail Jake was so evil, but intense. At first I thought that the movie was ok at the beginning, then it slowly got better, and the 2nd half of the film was so intense.\nEthan Hawke played the only person in the movie that wasn't a bad guy, but he just got manipulated by Denzel Washington, so he could be blackmailed into doing whatever he was told to do. He played a very intense role in this, that along with the terrific performance of Denzel Washington kept you on the edge of your seat the whole time.\nIn the end everything happens the way you wanted it too.

Not to say I had a negative feel about it going in, quite the opposite is true, but I had no idea how gritty, dirty, realistic and immersive this would be. Training Day offers some very intense, authentic drama with brilliant acting and actually does keep you on the edge of your seat. \n\nConsidering the main focus is the interplay between the main characters, you better make sure you have some great actors in the lead and some great dialogue and boy are they! Denzel Washington completely steals every single scene he is in, which is most of the film but it does deviate to other subplots every so often and people say it was a 'make up Oscar' and I don't really want to get into that because that makes it sound like he didn't deserve it. Ethan Hawke was pretty incredible also, he is in pretty much every single scene besides one right at the end and I honestly think he got robbed of an Oscar but Jim Broadbent needed his time to shine and it was a pretty powerful year for both acting categories but I digress. The dialogue is fast, witty, snappy and quite memorable. It makes it all the more compelling and intense.\n\nIt's a very smart story and does give some things for the audience to think about, while I personally don't think it really got as deep as it thought it was, or really gave a real insight to the whole of police corruption- and maybe that was the point or I just missed the point, but, again, like I said, it gives the audience something to think about and shows both sides. While Denzel's character is quite despicable, I do see where he was coming from and sometimes the things he has to do are the only way to get something done, even if it is totally wrong. \n\nI didn't really think the last act was weak, it fit the story quite well and didn't just come out of nowhere, it was built up over time and it felt real, while it isn't as strong as the acts before it; it works. I just wanted it to keep going, it's a showcase of great storytelling and powerful acting, I could see myself re watching this many times in the future and it is a modern classic.",

The dark, gritty cinematography really adds to the dark and shady tone of the film. \nBut, without a doubt, the brightest and most effective thing about this crime flick is the sensational performance of Denzel Washington. A portrayal of a man who  likes to get business done his way. He can shoot an innocent, lie to your face, and convince of anything, all while keeping his sly grin and amusing wit. \nEthan Hawke's Hoyt is also portrayed nicely, as the innocent rookie coming into a type of police work he doesn't wasn't to be apart of. Hawke and Denzel have wonderful chemistry and work of each other wonderfully.\nThis movie has enough humor, action, and entertaining dialogue, to where Denzel's amazing performance seems like another good thing about this movie; but it is so much more. Alonzo Harris makes this movie, he is it's backbone, and he doesn't disappoint.",

Hawke is superb as Jake, a man who goes from fresh-faced rookie to hardened cop in a pretty short amount of time. Washington won the Best Actor Oscar for this, and he totally deserved it.

This is a wonderfully shot film, drawing you into it's shady suburbs. For the first time in years, Los Angeles looks and feels like a real city and not just a main street full of skyscrapers. For all it's accuracy, I confess that some of the \"hood\" dialogue lost me (I'm a pasty white boy, can't help it!) and this marred the ending slightly, which did feel slightly contrived and hurried to fit the time frame.

Denzel is what everybody walks away from this movie talking about, and rightfully so.  From the very first moment he appears onscreen, you cannot take your eyes off him.  He makes you transfix on him with a dominating performance playing an evil, godless son of a bitch.   Up until this movie, Denzel had almost always played the likable protagonist; here, it is such a deviation, it's shocking, and the only other actor I've seen do it so effectively is Henry Fonda playing Frank in Once Upon a Time in the West.  There is a wholly engaging dynamic between him and Ethan Hawke, who is the avatar for the audience, and you keep second-guessing yourself on if Alonzo is the biggest piece of scum of the Earth, or simply showing a rookie how it really is.  There is a loss of innocence story being told parallel a downfall story of Scarface proportions, and the tension levels are through the roof with excellent pacing and a tight script (really, almost every single line Denzel delivers is quotable).  It's the only movie I've ever seen to effectively use rappers as actors, and it's one of my favorite movies.",

For example (spoiler alert) Denzel steals money from his best pal and cruelly executes him just so the greek tragedy is set up for the end.  Later, the whole hood, to a man, that Denzel controls conveniently turn against him, for no apparent reason, leading to his demise.  \n\nThen there are echos of other scenes from better movies such as the Godfather, Sonny Corleone's legendarily brutal machine gun execution which is recreated almost verbatim.  See if you can spot others.\n\nAll in all, a good way to spend two hours, provided you don't expect much originality.",

The story sounds so simple, but it was actually so brilliant and genius, because the film takes place on one day and shows the true nature of evil, and how corrupt a person can become.  The cast is probably the best part of the film, but when I say that I mostly mean Denzel Washington.  Denzel Washington plays one of the greatest and evil roles in film history, I mean at first he seems to be a little shaky but as the film goes on we realize that our protagonist has to work with a complete sociopath.

Harris has agreed to give Hoyt a shot at joining his team with a one-day ride-along during which Hoyt must prove his mettle. As the day wears on, however, it becomes increasingly clear to the greenhorn that his experienced mentor has blurred the line between right and wrong to an alarming degree, enforcing his own morally compromised code of ethics and street justice. \r\n\r\nAs he struggles with his conscience, an increasingly alarmed Hoyt begins to suspect that he's not really being given an audition at all; he's being set up as the fall guy in an elaborate scheme.\r\n\r\nDenzel Washington plays one of the most best villains of all time in a way that is so convincing that even we might feel this man ain't no bad.It shows the true stuff going on inside the LAPD.Very intense and the tensions between the two officers have been depicted neatly.\r\n\r\nHow Alonzo exploits ethan Hawke makes him do stuff ie really bad stuff is so amazingly shot that you will be entertained.The story is a pretty thin one and a predictable one.\r\n\r\nBut the sheer energy that Denzel actually gives to the character will make you clap for him!!\r\n\r\nSome scenes could have been made better like the one in which Ethan Hawke strips the medal off Denzel could have been better and made a bit more powerful.\r\n\r\nThe ending of the movie was a bit bizarre if they had changed that ending the movie would have been a great one!! Apart from that a movie that can keep you entertained all the way.\r\n\r\nOverall a slick watchable entertainer highly recommended for all denzel fans like me!\r\n\r\nMy rating:-7.6/10",

Training Day is a perfect film, and it's clear that this film struggles with a semi decent script. Denzel Washington's performance is what saves this picture from a being a total dud. Despite the fact that it's uneven, Training Day manages quite entertaining. I'm not saying that this is a good film, but it does have a few good, action packed moments. The dramatic elements thrown into the story barely work, and feel unnatural in the story's overall progression. I did enjoy the films ending, and Denzel Washington really brought it when this film could have been a total disaster. Training Day is worth watching, but its never excellent, and the rappers here such as Dr Dre and Snoop Dogg should stick to the music (not that its good music to begin with) as these two aren't fit to be actors. Though it lacks anything really thrilling, Training Day manages to be a decent time waster despite the fact that it's barely an average film. Like I said before, Denzel Washington saved this film from being a poor action drama, and it's because of his performance alone that this is a film that's watchable.",

In comparison Ethan Hawke has rarely been better, giving a much quieter but arguably more complex performance than his costar.

His ambition is crack down on bigger game like muggers, murderers, rapists and all other assorted weirdos plaguing the streets of Los Angeles. Thus he en-rolls in a training session with LAPD's finest narcotics detectives Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). During the process, young Jake learns more than he could chew when he discovers that detectives are not always prone to play-by-the-rules. Now he's in a position where he must decide if he wants to continue or if he wants to end it. \n\nThe script is very well researched and very easy to grasp at. The dialogue is fast and furious and can be very witty at times. The pace is at its most convenient and though the action is wild it still offers room for plenty of mind-numbing twists. The only real flaw is that it gives a negative view of how unlawful the more advanced law enforcers can be. Those alleged people who protect us from crime are no more criminal than the people they arrest. In many true story films like \"American Gangster\" (another film Washington was in) proves my point. \n\nDenzel Washington deserved his Oscar here as he takes direct command in this movie. Even in the scenes where he's only mentioned by name, he still makes his presence felt. Denzel who can play good guy roles to near perfection does something that few actors and actresses can do: take a u-turn to type-casting and play a more tyrannical character. Ethan Hawke is equally impressive as a cop who must have long restless nights wondering how did he get himself into this mess and how to get out of it or if there is a way out of it. Sadly the supporting cast are mostly underdeveloped fillers with really no depth. \n\nFor an action movie, the action is quite scarce. Most of the tense scenes are through the unsettling of Jake's inner conscious. The real story isn't about Jake's fight for what's right, but just the inner emotions that are screaming at Jake every moment he goes to work or training. You want thrill-seeking shooters rent \"Lethal Weapon\". The violent scenes are not for the squeamish and the gore is very believable. \n\nSure it has plenty of action for the action-junkie, but it's also a very intelligent film to back up on as well. The theme is who should you trust, your soul or your mind? With stunning action scenes and a believable premise, this has got to be the best heart-warming thriller that will leave you stunned for a long time.",

Now I finally have a chance to sit down and watch the whole thing through to the end and holy shit. Fuck this is a good movie, just when you think that you know what is going to happen, bitch think again. This is one of the few movies that I really liked Denzel Washington in. Just like Samuel Jackson, this man really know how to chew up the scene. This movie is two and a half hours long and I didn't even realize it until I looked at the back of the box. The plot is tricky in how simple it is because it has a lot of depth to it. A young cop is given a chance to join up with narc group and spends the day hanging out with the captain. As he shows him the ropes it becomes harder and harder to tell if what he is doing is right because of how he goes about things. The reason this works so well is because Denzel's character has such a powerful and charismatic personality that you can't help but really listen to him. Overall if you were like me and hadn't seen this shit yet, do it.",

Jake (Ethan Hawke) is a confused rookie who's experiencing his first day on the job with his new partner, Alonzo (Denzel).  Even though he's nervous and in over his head he keeps his wits about him throughout the experience, proving he's every bit as tough as Alonzo, who is undeniably the best part of the movie.  Denzel plays a complete madman who takes you on a psychotic ride that makes you feel as though you're in Jake's shoes the whole time.  It's impossible to figure him out.  Is he just a really good cop who knows how to play the system, or is he as crooked as they come?",

Denzel puts in a monster performance as a cop gone not just bad but damn near evil, it's no wonder he won the oscar. Ethan Hawke was great as well but when standing next to someone who's shining so bright it's hard to stand out. \n Throughout the film as the day unfolds Denzel's character subjects Hoyt to more and more shit that it's hard to believe that he'll make it to the end of the day, then the big reveal comes and it fucking mindbending that what you've been watching has been planned to the letter from the start. I liked all the cameos from music stars, none of which are terrible, and the fact that they used real gang locations and actual gang members from those areas.\n The fact that Denzel's character is such a cliche in ways of a dirty cop to begin with but as it goes on it becomes more apparent that he is the only cliche in the film and the way he views the gangs and the criminals is far from how it really is, the fact that they hate him because he hasn't earned respect and isn't honest about what he does but they are and respect Ethan Hawke's good cop character was one of the better parts of the whole film for me.

            "content": "Training Day is a US cop thriller starring Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke. Hawke plays cop Jake Hoyt who transfers from traffic duty to narcotics in the hope it holds the key to advancing his career. Jake unfortunately is being evaluated by Detective Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington), he has one day to prove to Alonzo he can handle narcotics. Training Day simply follows Hoyte over a 24 hour period. As the day progresses Hoyte realises that Alonzo doesn't care for rules, he uses drugs he confiscates, drinks on the job and uses violence and intimidation against offenders. Hoyte rebels against Alonzo's methods but he assures Hoyte it's the right thing to do and has financial benefits. Detective Harris also seems to be friendly with shady characters in the gang community along with the 'Three Wise Men' or his crooked superiors who he buys fake arrest warrants off of. Later in the day Hoyte meets Alonzo's team and it seems they are planning something big, Alonzo's debt to some Russian gangsters also comes to light. \r\n \r\n Training Day has some clever plot twists but also consists of quite average action sequences and acting. Denzel Washington won an Oscar for his performance as Detective Harris, I don't think his performance was outstanding but both he and Hawke give strong performances which help hold the film up. Other rolers in the film were filled by Eva Mendes who played Sara, Scott Glenn who played Roger and Tom Berenger who played Stan Gursky. A bit of shallow humour lightened the mood of the thriller which was a nice touch. The ending was a little disappointing and unnecessarily dragged out, it was, however gritty and brash.",

Harris gives Hoyt one simple task; accompany him on a one-day ride-along where he must prove himself worthy of enlistment. Now from this point on the movie maintains a steady level of immense entertainment. The most noteworthy aspect of this movie is Denzel Washington's Academy-Award Winning portrayal of Alonzo Harris; the rugged cop that has seemingly blurred the line between what is right and what isn't. His performance is as charismatic and imposing, as it is chilling and antagonizing. Every line that Washington delivered was either intensely funny or incredibly demented (but still funny). Which brings me to the script; \"The Fast And The Furious\" writer, David Ayer, delivers deeply provocative dialogue, as well as a compelling narrative that delves into some very insightful themes. The main theme of the movie, however, seems to be a blend of the \"Crime doesn't pay\" and \"Power corrupts\". So, in a sense, this story not only provides an incredibly accurate depiction of Inner-city LA, and exceedingly tense performances from its actors, but it may also serve as a cautionary tale - a cautionary tale that would not have been told sans the tremendous direction from Antoine Fuqua. Fuqua really did an impeccable job at delivering methodical, and aesthetic visuals. Fuqua also used his personal connections to access parts of LA that most people has never seen, in a sense, giving these parts of LA a voice. All in all, I found \"Training Day\" to be a steadily enjoyable film with great performances across the board, a wonderful story and script, and a solid direction. Remarkable.",

            "content": "I can definitely see why an African American film enthusiast might really dislike this movie seeing as how Denzel Washington had made a career out of playing dignified and mostly famous African Americans and THIS is what got him his Best Actor Oscar. It's like the Academy said Malcolm X? Bah, that's not how black people behave, pull out a Gat say nigga in every other sentence and behave in an illegal and immoral manner? THAT'S how black people behave. I however, realize the Academy Awards are silly and therefore this is one of my favorite movies. While the movie is entirely implausible its look at LA is gritty and damn near realistic as a result of Director Antoine Fuqua's actually directing it, in some of the worst areas of LA. We're talking The Jungles, Hoover Block and indeed Imperial Courts the first time Gangs had allowed a film to be made in the latter. The authentic on location shots and the passing glances from most likely random people in the streets in some of the bad areas add to Jake's feeling of being out of place while also enforcing Alonzo's feeling of just the opposite... But how successful is this movie of tapping into the urban scene, ultimately is it successful at gaining legitimacy in the street culture or does it come across as laughably misguided? Let's take a look my nigga. \r\n\r\nThis is one of those wonderful movies that narratively takes place in a 24 hour period and pulls it off shockingly well. Our protagonist is Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke who shows uncommon versatility and provides the perfect foil for Washington) a beat cop with aspirations of being a Narcotics Officer. However to achieve this lofty aspiration he must survive a trial by fire of sorts shadowing another Narcotics Officer for a day, Alonzo Harris (Washington who is fucking magnetic in this movie managing to in every other scene either attract or repel and being both incredibly likeable and a crazy asshole with a God complex). Jake is the type of honest cop that you read about in story books and unfortunately for him Harris has been under too long to the point the line between him and the thugs you encounter are heavily blurred not that he doesn't always have a bullshit explanation for his actions. We'll see him rob countless petty criminals but always let them go, rob the house of a gang leader's wife (Macy Gray who gets a little too into the hood rat role), and even stab a friend in the back in the worst possible way; all leaving Jake with the same question, What is right and what is wrong? Is he a sheep or a WOLF?\r\n\r\nThis movie may wish it was deeper than it actually is but the story is a tour de force of intriguing dialogue, sparse action and a story that while always sticking to the same line twists and turns a few times taking you along for the ride. As I'm sure you can tell from my description this movie could benefit heavily from a colorful and talented supporting cast but its lucky the movie's interesting enough and Hawke and Washington are damn good enough that it's not necessary because talent is hard to be found here. Macy Gray Snoop Dogg and Cliff Curtis have fun in their respective thug roles and I enjoyed the scenes with Scott Glenn in a particularly bad ass turn which is particularly masterful since he never leaves his arm chair except to answer the door. Everyone else is pretty unremarkable and some supporting cast members like Dr. Dre probably brought in solely to lend street credibility to the production should stick with their respective careers. I don't understand that a major point of debate in this film is the ending which a lot of people even those who liked everything else were not entirely impressed by because I quite enjoyed. I won't ruin to much but it's one of my favorite actions scenes of all time and shows Fuqua more than knows how to handle a gun fight. I particularly loved its use of long continuous cuts which made the scene all the more drawn out and therefore brutal and intense. And I love how they could have easily made Jake change in the 24 Hour period and commit the murder he had the opportunity too but he leaves with his grace intact which makes him one of my favorite and most respected characters of all time.\r\n\r\nIf you couldn't tell I loved this movie and I view it as one hundred percent a great work in film. It has an authentic LA Hood feel though I've never lived in one so I can't really confirm that and has two of the strongest characters in the declining genre of crime movies in the 21st Century. The settings and stories are riveting and seem to flow well throughout the movie even if it doesn't seem possible for all this too have occurred in a single day. You ultimately leave the movie thinking and unsure of how you feel about what just transpired and what it all means and for a \"Hood\" movie that's one hell of an accomplishment as the genre has suffered greatly in the past. It indulges in wickedness and immorality but ultimately must stick with the straight and narrow in order to effectively portray its message. Though in a closing thought giving Jake's perspective a green filter when he smokes weed was a little silly.",

L.A.P.D. detective Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) has the job of cleaning up those streets, but he does this with questionable methods. Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) has wanted to be a Narcotics officer, but in order to be accpeted he must go through 24 hours of training with a veteran officer, this being Harris. Jake soon finds that this job might not be for him as Harris' methods continue to get worse as the day goes on, and now Jake must struggle to find a way through this one training day.\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, before I saw training Day I honestly can say I wasn't expecting too much, but after it was over there was no doubt that this film did not live up to its potential. It actually had a somewhat creative plot, it at least wasn't your basic police drama. My biggest initial issue with the film was the fact that it is directed by Antoine Fuqua. I have only two of his films, Shooter and King Arthur. Shooter was okay and King Arthur made me never want to watch another one of his films again. But surprisingly enough his direction in Training Day is not terrible. There definitely were some useless scenes thrown in there, and there was not very much character development, which is something I really hate not to see in films. After all, if the characters are not developed then the audience does not actually feel for them, and if the audience does not feel for them it hardly matters what happens in the end. This was the case here, and to make it worse the ending was a huge disappointment.  If Antoine Fuqua did something right it was that he did at least make a somewhat thrilling film that keeps the audience interested. It looked as if Training Day was going to be a very good police drama that overcame its flaws, and even though it does, the ending really hurt the film. Like I said, Antoine Fuqua can, and has done a lot worse with his direction, but he had serious potential to bring home a great film here, and he didn't.\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Ayer was the screenwriter, another one I like to stay away from. All he seems to ever write are your basic mindless action films, and since the average movie goer often finds such great entertainment in those films, while I do not, they really just get on me nerves. Nowadays I will do my absolute best to stay away from action films, unless they come highly recommended. And even though this film is a large improvement from your average action flick, Ayer still did not have a very good screenplay. The dialogue was pretty bad, Denzel Washington's character had many cheesy lines, and Ethan Hawke's the same. Just your average annoying action flick.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut what set Training Day apart from most action movies? The acting, which is obvious. Before recently seeing this film I thought Russell Crowe was robbed from his deserving Oscar for his performance in A Beautiful Mind. However, after I saw this I can admit that I was very wrong. The Academy has had its goofs over the years, but this certainly was not one of them. Denzel Washington has always been a good actor, not one of my favorites because he always acts the exact same in every film, but there is no denying he has a gift in acting. However, from what I have seen I think this is his best performance. He played the part of the questionable and corrupt detective perfectly. And even as I have already expressed my displeasure with the ending, his acting in the climax was unbelievable. I really cannot say enough about his acting, except that even with the films many, many flaws, the acting saved it. I am by no means an Ethan Hawke. He has played in some excellent films, but for the most part him as an actor I don't really care for. That is, except for this film. His innocence was completely believable, and his character was perhaps the most believable out of the group. He was in every way deserving of his supporting actor nomination at the Oscars.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, Training Day is not like your average police drama, which should at least count for something. But its sloppy direction and not so great screenplay really hurt it by the end. I will admit despite the flaws it is certainly an at times thrilling, yet brutal film. Everything is shot very well, and it has a nice musical score to help it out. The acting was absolutely incredible. Denzel Washington gives a career performance (from what I have seen) and her definitely comes through playing the bad cop. Ethan Hawke is a fine surprise in this film, as he gives his best performance that I have seen. The largest downfall is as I have mentioned the ending, but if you can get past it the film is good. I would recommend it to action films fans, and everyone else watch it for the acting.",

The story sounds so simple, but it was actually so brilliant and genius, because the film takes place on one day and shows the true nature of evil, and how corrupt a person can become.  The cast is probably the best part of the film, but when I say that I mostly mean Denzel Washington.  Denzel Washington plays one of the greatest and evil roles in film history, I mean at first he seems to be a little shaky but as the film goes on we realize that our protagonist has to work with a complete sociopath.

            "content": "As first days on new jobs go - it doesn't get much tougher than this. Straight and narrow Ethan Hawke gets the opportunity to try-out for Denzel Washington's Narcotic Division in this gritty but absorbing tale. The heartlands of California's gang neighbourhoods are the hunting grounds for self-proclaimed 'wolf' Alonzo (Washington in an Oscar winning role), an officer who effectively runs the streets and bends the rules to satify his own status, serving up his own brand of justice and law. When a new officer named Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) is given the chance to earn a spot in his division, Alonzo revels in the role of both crazed enforcer and street-wise mentor.\n\nWashington's portrayal of Alonzo is fantastic. The character is funny, charming but equally dangerous and self-serving. Despite the good he professes to be doing - there's a sense of ego-feeding and a kind of vigilante dictatorship in force. That we still feel some empathy for this character through the unfolding, fateful day in the life, speaks volumes. A rare departure into villanous territory for Washington - but he really commands every second he's on screen. Hawke plays second fiddle - but does a good job as  an honest cop trying to make the most of his opportunity. There are several points when  Hoyt should and probably could walk - but is always reeled back in by Alonzo's justifications or challenges. You really feel like you've gone through everything with Hoyt at the end (even if things are maybe wrapped up a little too neatly).\n\nThe movie is economically paced - almost all of the time there is something happening - whether it's the great dynamic between Hoyt and Alonzo or the brewing elements of the plot that really come to a head towards the end, Training Day is a great film. The action is never too flashy, the dialogue and it's delivery is top-notch and there's not much really anything negative to say. The supporting roles are perferctly played - but  I would have liked to have seen more of the '3 wise men' as they are titled - and see more of influences or pressures that they exert. We also get a glimpse of Alonzo's life - but see very little of his background. These minor points do not take away from what is a very fine film.\n\nTraining Day is a day well spent.",

            "content": "My favourite Denzel Performance Ever...\r\nDenzel Washington has proven himself to be atop the elite for years.  Everything from The Hurricane, to American Gangster, and Malcolm X.  But I personally believe his best film was Training Day.  You can really tell he put his heart and soul into this performance, especially towards the end.  I haven't heard of the director Antoine Fuqua before this, but hey I personally think he did a pretty damn good job.  This is truly one of my favourite films of all time, for sure in my top 50.\r\n\r\nTraining Day follows rookie cop Jake Hoyt.  He joins Alonzo Harris and his narcotics crew for one day.  On paper, Alonzo is the best narc there is, he has been on top for 13 years, and believes he will never fall.  With a completely unorthodox style, Jake starts to think it is way more than he signed up for.  As the day progresses, Jake realizes that Alonzo's status is alot different then he expected.  Turns out Alonzo is as crooked as they get, and will do anything to protect himself...but what will Officer Hoyt do?\r\n\r\nThe acting is great, the story is amazing, the script is fricken awesome, and the directing is pretty good.  Something about this film makes me love it, mostly because of Denzel's rawness in it.  He is honestly bad ass!\r\nAs for Ethan Hawke, I think he did a very good job.  You would think I'd be paying attention to Washington the whole time, because of his performance, but I actually really liked Hawke's performance, and his character.  Although Denzel obviously stole the show, I think Ethan Hawke did a good job showing that he has talent, and Denzel isn't the only stand out here.  \r\nA special surprise is Eva Mendes.  You would not expect her to be in it, although for only a short time, it was still a pretty good bonus.  As she plays a Latina mother to Alonzo's kid.  \r\nOther appearances include, Snoop Dogg, Dr.  Dre, and Terry Cruze!  \r\n\r\nTraining Day is a must for any lover of crime films.  It is probably my second favourite cop film, behind The Departed. \r\n\r\nMy Rating For Training Day Is\r\n93%",

To me, a good actor is someone who just IS a character...if it isn't obvious that they are acting than they are doing a good job. That was the case with Washingon. He just was Alonzo. Every pantomime, every word, every glance was performed masterfully. Did Mr. Washington deserve his Oscar? Absolutely. 200%.

Although the plot is intense, a few twists and turns slows down the movie towards the middle of the film but the ending sums it all up from the bad timing. One scene I loved was when everyone in the neighborhood noticed how Alonzo was a bad guy and they turn on him by standing by Jake's side.

Alonzo steals drugs and money while cooperating with gangsters and drug dealers to elevate his business.

Washington is at first a caricature of a true human being, but as his brash and criminal element branches out, his cold heart becomes apparent, much like the fake persona serial killers use. Instead of just being a hate mongering cop on the backslide, he also manipulates a fellow officer (Hawke) into his ring of criminal activity. Hawke is clean in everything he does, from turning down drugs and money to saving a girl from being raped. He's a cowboy dressed all in white, no flaws about him, actually boring next to Washinton's daring role. Weaving throughout are gang relations, police brutality, drugs, armed robbery, and a reality that all the people that Washington's character, Alonzo, believes are under his thumb, actually hate the patronizing attitude he shows towards them. Between all the political incorrectness and unsubtle nuances, there is a message of honesty triumphing over all.",

The plot of Training Day is very intense, from trying drugs, investigating houses, and gang activity. Although the plot is intense, a few twists and turns slows down the movie towards the middle of the film but the ending sums it all up from the bad timing. One scene I loved was when everyone in the neighborhood noticed how Alonzo was a bad guy and they turn on him by standing by Jake's side. This scene is amazing because the audience is relieved and can predict Alonzo's future.

It's clear that Washington is putting Hawke through all sorts of hell, that is constantly causing him to question his morals and ethics. While Hoyt thinks their going through the routines of sniffing out drug sellers and kingpins, in all actuality, Washington is trying to pull off the perfect plan of quickly gathering all the money he can through various outlets, while covering his ass and utilizing a wide assortment of other corrupted cops in order to pay off the Russian mob for his mistakes. This would ultimately lead towards Hawke being his biggest tool of all. This movie more than lives up to its praise as it manages to be very thrilling and entertaining. There's also an impressive supporting cast that includes appearances by the likes of Scott Glenn, Tom Berenger, Harris Yulin, rappers Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg, Cliff Curtis, Macy Gray, Raymond J. Barry, and especially Eva Mendes (who we see ALL of top to bottom and boy is it glorious!) in her breakthrough role. Kudos to writer David Ayer who at that point that an impressive resume with established screenplays of U-571 and The Fast and the Furious, as well as director Antoine Fuqua who established himself as a serious director with Training Day after only doing music videos, wacky action flicks The Replacement Killers and Bait.

Though at first you'll actually like his character and whatever he says seems to make a lot of sense. Is this his best performance ever, and a reason to get an oscar? no, i've seen him do better, but he certainly makes the movie stand out. It must be said that all actors are perfectly cast, even snoop dog has a fitting decent (small) role. It loses some points at the end, losing much of the credebility and getting kind of messy.",

But, I didn't feel too much for some of the characters. That is however, except for Alonzo, who was a great villain. The story at times was great, but the ending was really disappointing and for the majority of the film, it feels like a standard Police Thriller. I know that a lot of people praise this film up and down, but it's not great.",

It was only the second such statue handed to a black male; only Sidney Poitier - for \"Lilies of the Field\" forty years earlier - came before. For that reason and performance alone, recommended viewing. \n\nIn Act I, it appears that 'training day' will be this 24 hours, the first day on-the-job for Ethan Hawke, newbie choir-boy come to the L.A. Narc Squad, filled with dreams of cleaning up Gotham's filthy streets. The training will be dealt out by Washington, of course, whom Hawke's admired from afar. \n\nSoon enough, Hawke learns Washington's not an object-to-idolize but rather a grizzled street warrior who easily walks both sides - no, all sides - of the law. As the film progresses, however, it becomes less and less clear who will end up the real trainee on this particular day. \n\nWashington's simply hypnotizing and fascinating to watch here, whether you buy into the twisty plot or not. Denzel's got the street and the system down cold, as cold as any character who has ever graced celluloid. And he works it well, cleverly fast-talking and fast-thinking his way through every opportunity and mishap, turning up win-wins for every player - except for those that respect the integrity of the law, as does Hawke. \n\nRECOMMENDATION: For the character and the performance that Washington delivers here, certainly one-spin recommended.",
