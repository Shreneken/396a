    "summary": "Royal Tenenbaum and his wife Etheline had three children and then they separated. All three children are extraordinary --- all geniuses. Virtually all memory of the brilliance of the young Tenenbaums was subsequently erased by two decades of betrayal, failure, and disaster. Most of this was generally considered to be their father's fault. \"The Royal Tenenbaums\" is the story of the family's sudden, unexpected reunion one recent winter.",

The characters are quirky and unique without becoming thinly veiled caricatures of real people. Above all else however, the tone that Anderson crafts here leaves one wondering whether they should laugh or cry. The powerful sense of sadness that permeates much of his work shines through here.\n\nA brilliant film about the nature of family and the human condition, a must watch.",

The story to the movie is of course about the Tenenbaum family who are all basically a family of geniuses. As the family get older they begin to drift apart even more then they were before, but when Royal, the father of the family announces that he's dying, the family all meet up again. The Royal Tenenbaums is of course a comedy, but it sure does have it's drama in it and even though I wouldn't say it was the most brilliant movie around as it's not really 'my type of movie,' it is recommended for those who want to see a different comedy as it will and does have it fans.",

Ben Stiller plays the anal retentive survivor of a wife's death in a plane crash and angriest of sons. Bill Murray plays Paltrow's estranged husband with subtle humor.

I feel like the reaction to this movie is a live-action representation to the emperor's new clothes. The only positive is that this film's star studded cast performed admirably, but Owen Wilson's screenplay doomed this movie from the very start. The cartoonish characters were not only unrelatable but somehow horribly boring and the plot was nonexistent. It would have been a terrible movie even if they didn't kill a beagle at the end of the movie to fulfil a cardboard cutout \"druggie\" character. To make things even worse, the children, who were witness to the brutal killing of their beloved pet, were completely unaffected. They had a \"memorial\" for the dog as an afterthought, but since the family replaced Buckley immediately with a Dalmatian (that for some reason the firefighters responding to the crash just SOLD TO A COMPLETE STRANGER) and he wasn't mourned at all I have to assume Wes Anderson is a complete psychopath for thinking that this passes for anything resembling human behavior. I hope, looking back, people will finally recognize this movie for what it is: a inexcusable waste of talent and a complete waste of time for anyone unfortunate enough to watch it.",

Everyone in the theater walked out in silence.\n\nWhat was wrong with the movie? Basically, there was nothing right with the movie. The characters were repulsive, the direction was erratic, the storyline moved ever-so-slowly, and the performers behaved as if they were all on tranquilizers. Presumably the people who found laughs in it considered things like incest and dogs being crushed to death in car accidents hilarious.\n\nI am at a loss as to what the movie's apologists saw in it.

As would be expected from Anderson, the movie is a visual wonder with a vibrant color palette and a camera that never seems to stop moving.

The soundtrack, acting performances & production design were all excellent but a ton of things rubbed me the wrong way. Too many decisions felt like they'd been made for no other purpose than adding to the endless list of \"quirks\" that the director seemed entirely too proud of, most notably the annoying decision to name Hackman's character Royal & not pronouncing Tenenbaum the way I'd been doing it in my head leading up to watching this. Wes did interviews citing several influences that not only had similar elements; entire subplots came from other work without much alteration, like the excessively talented children & the incest stuff. The purpose of the movie appeared to be to show Hackman being awful (including a scene of full-on racism) & then being forgiven for it rather than a more appropriate response. The characters were made so distinct from each other that at no point did it feel like they were a real family rather than a list of characters the director thought of & at no point did their arcs seem to merge into a cohesive story. They let multiple quality joke opportunities pass in order to provide deeply uninteresting dramatic scenes, leaving this an unfunny entry into the comedy genre. Using words like \"absurdist\" or \"ironic\" to describe the movie is fine by me but I don't personally think a movie trying so hard to be those two things can be considered successful. To me this was similar to fetish porn in that one can understand why it was made & how others found it appealing, but it was just very thoroughly not my cup of tea. I'm not out here kinkshaming though, so it gets a few stars from me!",

Royal is out of a home, and decides to fake sick so he can move in with his estranged wife, Etheline - an equally fantastic Angelica Houston. Their three adult children are now also living in the house for various reasons. The tale is not a simple one, but is told breezily and comfortingly in a way synonymous with Wes Anderson. Luke Wilson in particular stands out as Richie, and his emotional moment packs a gut punch that sticks with you. Fantastic music, direction and design (and soundtrack) decorate every frame, and Alec Baldwin's narration is perfect in setting the many tones of the film. Watching this is an adult in his late-thirties is a lot different than watching it as a young adult - there's a lot more to get and understand, but it's still an ultimately enjoyable work of art that stays in my mind.",

            "content": "A dreamy experience of heartwarming charm and real emotion.\n\nWes Anderson's indie comedy-drama The Royal Tenenbaums (2001) is a pleasant bit of escapism for anyone that needs a laugh or some sincerity. The Royal Tenenbaums may be Wes' best feature film. Wes Anderson's status as an American auteur and cinema icon are forever solidified with his third motion picture: The Royal Tenenbaums. It's gentle spirit, fast pace, dark subject matter, and earnest tackling of these issues make The Royal Tenenbaums timeless fun. Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson's script takes on family, expectations, disappointment, parenting, divorce, marriage, love, and death. The Royal Tenenbaums is approached with an irreverent, absurdist sense of humor that makes the film a blast to watch, but the dramatic segments hit hard making The Royal Tenenbaums Wes Anderson's most serious film to date despite the majority of it remaining fantastic comedy.\n\nDylan Tichenor's editing is so neat and fast that he effortlessly takes you across an entire family's 22 year journey in a brisk 110 minute movie. Karen Patch's costumes are iconic already from Gwyneth Paltrow's fur coat, striped mini-dress, and black eye-liner look to Gene Hackman's pink suit. Everyone in The Royal Tenenbaums looks hilarious or cool. Mark Mothersbaugh's score is magical for The Royal Tenenbaums. Combining folk rock, alternative rock, and indie rock sounds for a whimsical soundscape like every Wes Anderson picture. David Wasco and Carl Sprague's production design is killer with their cute New York house and apartment designs. Their use of bright primary colors fits Robert D. Yeoman's symmetrical framing and quaint wide shots for comedic value. All his close-up shots are intimate and striking as well.\n\nGene Hackman is phenomenal as Royal Tenenbaum. He flawlessly cons his family into allowing him to stick around, then genuinely gets to know each person and attempts to aid them with their problems. Gene Hackman elevates an already impressively crafted feature into a cult classic. He is funny in every scene with these little gestures and particular phrases, while also authentically finding his character's heartfelt core. The Royal Tenenbaums is honestly one of Gene Hackman's best performances in an already legendary career. He's very fun here.\n\nAnjelica Huston is excellent as a nurturing mother learning to love again. Danny Glover is fun and likable as her new lover. Ben Stiller is outstanding as a grieving widower and overprotective father with no forgiveness for his own. Gwyneth Paltrow hypnotizes you every scene with her natural beauty and alluring emo aesthetic. Her dour mood is a fun shift in tone as she steals every scene she's in as far as I'm concerned. Luke Wilson is devastating in one of his best acting roles, while Owen Wilson hams it up as a drug addicted novelist and part-time cowboy. Andrew Wilson cameos as Gwyneth's relation within a hilarious axe scene.\n\nBill Murray is likable as Gwyneth's older husband. His disappointment and frustration are particularly funny, while also being naturally sad about everything. Seymour Cassel has a fun cameo as a hotel worker and medical enthusiast. Dipak and Kumar Pallana have great cameos like in Bottle Rocket and Rushmore.\n\nI should mention that I really enjoyed Alec Baldwin's straightlaced narration. His voice tenderly contributes to The Royal Tenenbaums' moving tone. Additionally, if you listen in closely, you can hear Wes Anderson himself voice the first tennis match commentator.\n\nIn all, The Royal Tenenbaums has persisted as an indie film classic with good reason. It is miraculously well crafted with cute direction, fun performances, sweet music, and genuine heart. I love The Royal Tenenbaums and would happily recommend it for anyone that wants to smile.",

Not only are likable characters crucial for most films, they're essential to Wes's. These characters' quirkiness, unlike in all other Andersen films, is not charming or endearing. \n\nThe central premise is that the Tenenbaums¬†are, basically, the Incandenza family from Infinite Jest (There's even a tennis prodigy connection), albeit less remarkable and more messed up. Or, at least, messed up in a different way.\n\nRoyal Tenenbaum himself, the patriarch and central figure to the story, is written to be insufferable. The problem with unlikable characters is that I do not enjoy watching them because they are unlikable. Unfortunately, Royal gets the most screentime.\n\nThe rest of the family inherited his personality flaws, and it doesn't outweigh their redeeming distinct character traits. Following their hamfisted journey to reconstruct the family felt like a chore gone awry.\n\nSecondly: there is a bizarre lack of signature Wes Andersen-y shots. I won't rattle off what qualities a Wes Andersen-y, shot has, but film lacked them. Or, at least, they were too subtle to be remarkable.\n\nIn summation, this doesn't feel like a Wes Andersen film, and that's bad. In an ensemble piece, the characters are unlikable and uncharming and the cinematography lacked the director's signature, lovable style. Therefore, I did not like or love this film.",

Wes Anderson; the director, as always, is excellent in his work on execution and the primary reason it always works is his awareness of the vision that he wishes to implement on screen. The performance is of course, amazingly done because of such a great cast especially Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Gwyneth Paltrow and Gene Hackman.

Yet, I dare you to watch the first few minutes of this film, and tell me it could have been made by anyone else. This is someone who, much like Edgar Wright with editing, and Tarantino with dialogue, has something so distinct and unique about his approach to filmmaking that you can't miss it. And by no means is his style a gimmick, in any way. The story of 'The Royal Tenenbaums' is sweet and quirky - indeed like most of Anderson's filmography - and were it made by anyone else the end product would have turned out fine, but likely wouldn't have been anything more than that. With Anderson at the helm, however, he elevates this material to more than it has any right to be. The little nuances, the great direction, the beautiful cinematography - along with the typical bevy of great performances his work always has - allow him to make something we've seen before feel wholly original. And if that isn't talent, I don't know what is.",

A treat! \nAlthough, I wonder, does a Wes Anderson movie always require that the characters stay so static?

But it's years down the road, I'm more knowledgeable about movies now, and my tastes have broadened. Plus I've seen some other Wes Anderson movies, and I get him now, and understand what to expect out of his stuff. \n\nThe problem...I'm wrong, I don't get Wes Anderson at all. His humor continues to be flat for me. His style, while meticulously detailed in every single visual, does nothing for me. His movies feel like they are capturing the lives of an alien race that has tried to emulate life on Earth but they still haven't quite mastered human behavior yet. Most of the performances are emotionless and expressionless, so it's dreadfully hard to care about anyone in the film. But I never know, with Wes Anderson's films, if he's aiming to impact me in any kind of emotional way or if he just wants to show me a pretty picture. \n\nEvery once in awhile one of the better actors in The Royal Tenenbaums (like Gene Hackman or Bill Murray) will slide some acting past Anderson's sterilization and I get my hopes up...\"maybe we'll have a real scene here!\" But hopes are quickly dashed when the camera flips back to Gwyneth Paltrow or a Wilson. There was a point about 30 minutes into the movie when I began clock-watching. The movie is not painful to watch, I just lack any investment in the characters or their story, so I get bored.

            "content": "A family portrait both melancholic and anarchic, the meticulous brushstrokes on display in writer-director Wes Anderson's Royal Tenenbaums present an auteur at the top of his game and the most entertaining and heartfelt filmic example yet of that old cinema chestnut: having one dysfunctional family under one roof for one last time. As a film reviewer, there's always a deep-seeded debate within one's psyche to concede that a particular filmmaker has made a better film than your personal favorite. For example, Quentin Tarantino's Jackie Brown still makes an astounding personal connection that this reviewer can only partly explain, the sometimes comedic '70s throwback caper having become this critic's go-to QT flick...even though Pulp Fiction and Inglourious Basterds remain, from top to bottom, more powerful, better directed, and better written notches on the writer-director's CV. Also, Steven Soderbergh won over the consensus of critics with Sex Lies and Videotape, won over the consensus of the Academy with Traffic, and won over the consensus of filmgoers with Ocean Eleven, but super slick and sexy slice of noir Out of Sight is the only Soderbergh film to chart on this reviewer's Top 10 list. The same dilemma rears its head with Anderson. Sure, he has made smarter comedies (the coming-of-age riotous-of-passage Rushmore), all-around better films (the decades-spanning sometime dramedy The Grand Budapest Hotel), more ambitious star-studded experiments (the stop motion-animated adult cartoon The Fantastic Mr. Fox), and even a more depressive family coming together (tear-soaked road comedy Darjeeling Limited), but notice that his Royal effort proves to be a convergence of all of these oft-kilter tropes and it all works so brilliantly. Everything - from the screenplay, set design, casting, soundtrack, and locations - serve as an integral cog in the world-building wheel of this fantastic and, at the time, funereal story about the undying bonds of family. Even beset with terminal cynicism and sarcasm, the idiosyncrasy-filled miscreants falling from the Tenenbaum family tree ultimately don't fail each other despite overwhelming odds and inklings. \n\nIn this R-rated comedy, an estranged family of former child prodigies reunites when their father announces he is terminally ill.\n\nTBS's Conan produced a spoof of Anderson's work that presents a Star Wars audition reel as if it had been written and directed by the man himself. Han Solo becomes a card-carrying member of an eccentric club who makes precocious-sounding lists with bullet points like \"Kill Greedo\" and rides along in the sidecar of a motorcycle driven by Chewbacca--all soundtracked by Barouche string-plucking that sounds right out of Mark Mothersbaugh's (W.A.'s longtime composer) playbook. It nails Anderson's quirky trademarks perfectly. Ironically, The Royal Tenenbaums - though it boasts many of the same Andersonian tropes as its predecessor, Rushmore - didn't make the auteur parody-worthy at the time. No, that honor fell on the follow-up, the oftentimes surrealistic but always indulgent The Life Aquatic starring Steve Zissou. Before Life Aquatic, all of the writer-director's films worked so well because, even though they immersed you in his very eccentric world, they always kept one foot in reality. Though very watchable, Life Aquatic keeps its head in the clouds (or under the sea, in this case) and never once attempts to get a reality check. On the other hand, Tenenbaums maintains this balance exceptionally well. Sure, it's hard to relate to the prodigies in question on the exterior of things (having an affair with an adopted sister seems bonkers), but their inner turmoil hits home again and again (the need to be loved and fear of exclusion drove the couple to it). Letter-perfect casting, of course, is the crucial element. From the titular Royal (Tenebaums rivals even The French Connection so far as Gene Hackman's best performance) to an old stand-by in a supporting role (Bill Murray as a cuckolded doctor gives a deadpan masterclass). The synergy that Anderson created here was so in-synch that it took 13 years to equal this triumph so far as world-building to complete perfection. Anderson's personal best, The Grand Budapest Hotel actually dealt with royalty. The Tenenbaums, however, remains purely Royal despite no claims on aristocracy.      \n\nBottom line: Family Valued",

There's an occasional moment of stoicism in certain characters, namely Gwyneth Paltrow's Margot, but unlike in Anderson's other films, this stoicism actually fits the characters and their development. Anderson has created a huge ensemble of characters, and they all have solid character arcs that are each relatable and sympathetic in their own way. It certainly helps that the cast is full of strong actors, many of which are Wes Anderson regulars, that allow for each character to be distinct and impactful. The real standout here is Gene Hackman, who really steals each scene he's in and leaves you completely invested in his estranged father figure of a character. Anderson certainly brings his quirky camerawork and visual style to this one, but it's not as grating as it is in his recent efforts, and it ends up fitting the film nicely. Wes Anderson's most serious film is certainly one of his more refined efforts.",

            "content": "The Royal Tenenbaums is Wes Anderson's masterpiece. As much as I admire and enjoy some of the man's other films, this 2001 gem is unequivocally his most satisfying work to date. It's easy to simply label it a quirky family dramedy, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. The Royal Tenenbaums is a look at three prodigy children dealing with the difficult truth that their lives are disappointments. It's the ultimate portrait of unfulfillment, as almost every character in Anderson's pitch-perfect ensemble is suffering in some way.\n\nThe patriarch of this clan is Royal (Gene Hackman). He's estranged from the rest of the Tenenbaums for a seemingly endless number of reasons. Etheline (Anjelica Huston), Royal's ex-wife (unofficially), is in a relationship with Henry Sherman (Danny Glover), a kind widower, who's ready to take the next step with Etheline. This incenses Royal, who returns to tell Etheline he's dying of stomach cancer and needs a place where he can live out his last six weeks. Of course, he's fine, but after six weeks with Etheline, he's certain he'll have won her back.\n\nUpon learning their father is dying, the Tenenbaum children return home. Chaz (Ben Stiller), a former financial wizard, is the oldest and deeply resents his father for taking advantage of his money as a minor. He's also a widower and is insanely overprotective of his two sons, Ari (Grant Rosenmeyer) and Uzi (Jonah Meyerson). Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) was adopted by Royal and Etheline and was an accomplished playwright before she ran away from home to find her real parents and ended up marrying a psychologist, Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray). Ritchie (Luke Wilson), the youngest Tenenbaum child, was a tennis star before having a meltdown on the court, which derailed his career. He's in love with his adopted sister, and it was her marriage that caused his meltdown. He's spent the last several years sailing around the world to forget his troubles. The only person he stays in contact with is his childhood best friend, and unofficial Tenenbaum son, the author Eli Cash (Owen Wilson).\n\nWith everyone under one roof-including the family butler, Pagoda (Kumar Pallana)-hijinks ensue. It's scenes like the one in which Royal spends the afternoon getting into trouble around the city with Ari and Uzi that ground The Royal Tenenbaums in comedic territory. But there's a lot more going on. Some of these people-particularly the three Tenenbaum children-have troubles that cut deep. Their demons drive the action; As Royal tries to reconnect with them, they must decide whether they want to forgive and move on or keep carrying these Royal-inflicted chips on their shoulders.\n\nAnderson's writing is mostly spot-on. The world he creates is appropriately strange, but unlike, say, The Life Aquatic, this one isn't completely beyond the realm of what's possible. Royal is perhaps Anderson's best character, and Gene Hackman gives what might be his best performance. Ben Stiller isn't quite as good as he would be playing it straight nine years later in Greenberg, but he hints at having chops stronger than those necessary to play Derek Zoolander and Greg Focker. Gwyneth Paltrow and Luke Wilson are also exceptional. They're the two most openly depressed individuals, and the way they mix this myopic sadness with doses of humanity and vulnerability (especially Wilson as Ritchie) is masterful.\n\nMost filmmakers, I'm sure, would kill to have a film like The Royal Tenenbaums to their name. It's one of the best the last decade in film had to offer, showing us the honest truth of expectations not met mixed in with wonderful humor, and that's saying nothing of Anderson's typically top-notch production values. It's clear Anderson's style of filmmaking isn't for everyone, but even if he's the antithesis of what you're looking for in a movie, The Royal Tenenbaums should offer you something. And for Anderson marks like myself, this is your heaven.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/royal-tenenbaums-review/",

As silly as this movie is, there actually is a good plot that comes with it.  All the actors seem to be out of there usual element in this film, playing different and obscure characters than you are used to seeing them play.  This film introduced me to Wes Anderson and I have since enjoyed just about all of his work since watching this.

The movie is shot in much more Anderson style than Rushmore is with his quick cuts, great attention to detail in every tight frame, and multiple angles and depth.  The cast consists of some of my favorite actors (Gene Hackman, Bill Murray, Gwyneth Paltrow), and the performances are fantastic.  A lot of information is divulged early and takes a little while to disseminate, but once you grasp each characters idiosyncrasies and motives, the film really gets into a flow.  Gene Hackman pulls off the sleezy manipulator very convincingly, and the rest of the characters are very well constructed and portrayed.  The narration, scene descriptions, and chapter breaks are all nice touches that add to the quirkiness, and the movie stays pretty even-keel throughout - even after Luke Wilson's big move - until the last 1/4.  This film is certainly not as light-hearted as Moonrise Kingdom or even Bottle Rocket, but this film has deeper undertones and deals with more palatable personal issues (and personal discovery) than some of his other films.

We are confined, instead of exploring the world he has created in this movie, to explore merely one house. \nYet, this brings me to another point. Because of the lack of a wild setting, Anderson is focusing more on the characters development. This lends a certain nuance to every actor's style in this movie. Much more than his other movies, these nuances seem to add to a sense of broader meaning, Anderson's take on a dysfunctional family.",

Accompanied by a great soundtrack, Wes Anderson's signature style is prominent here. The vibe of what seems to be a highly stylized New York is one of the many factors that will make The Royal Tenenbaums a particularly memorably film. It addresses the idea of families who are out of touch are often brought back together via tragedy, which can, in the end, make them stronger than ever.",

            "content": "If anyone has seen a Wes Anderson film, it's an experience you're not likely to forget in a hurry. The characters are just the little bit left of centre, the plot is just a little strange and the script is just a little bit completely insane. And this is his masterpiece.¬†\n\nThe Royal Tenenbaums documents the lives of three \"highly gifted\" children and their family, extending to their friend and neighbour Eli, to-be stepfather Henry, brother-in-law Raleigh, Raleigh's test subject Dudley, the family butler Pagoda and other assorted \"family\" members.¬†\n\nThe first thing to know about Wes Anderson's film is that it is, very definitely, Wes Anderson's film. Despite the powerhouse ensemble, Anderson's vision is clearly visible throughout the whole picture, both in his direction and in his script. His peculiar framing techniques, notably the ridiculously wide shots which include only the subject head and shoulders, aren't used to intentionally distract, rather to point out the subtle absurdity of the situation. His fluid style extends to glimpses of cinema verite style but is more controlled than the shaky cam we see more of today. He is able to transition from formalist to realist in a heartbeat and the thought behind every shot is palpable. In other words, this, especially in terms of direction, is a hell of a film. He is also able to add moments of humour or extra emotion to a scene simply by moving the camera a few degrees. The way he keeps the scene emotionlessly static during a few more heartrending scenes is restraint at its finest. And despite the obscure angles and strange framing, this is one of the overriding factors in the film: restraint. Rather than point out every little thing or make sure there's a close-up for the audience's sake, Anderson trusts his audience enough to let them figure it out for themselves. This makes multiple viewings not only a must but a joy as deeper and deeper levels of meaning and humour become apparent each time.¬†\n\nThe same can be said of the script. After each viewing, new jokes make themselves known, new levels of emotion can be discovered. Anderson's bone-dry deadpan in many situation works to great avail, especially in the humour side of things. Anderson also makes a very important distinction in his film: many of the moments may seem absurd, even surreal, but none of them ever excced the limitations of the possible. Each situation or moment is plausible in light of the characters which makes it all the more hilarious. Anderson's script is, first and foremost, a comedy and he is able to wring humour out of the most banal of situations, whether it's finding a javalina or walking into a closet. Secondly, though, it is a drama, and Wes is able to add in some truly beautiful moments as well as emotionally harrowing. Don't be surprised if you find yourself laughing and crying at the same time, at the same thing. Richie's bathroom sequence is one of the most amazing in the film and the ending is a beautiful example of indie weirdness with true emotion. Anderson's ability to juggle such a variety of complex relationships is truly commendable as well. He never relies on cliche or uses the obvious setup, despite having a huge interlocking network of characters on hand. Chas' fractured relationship with Royal together with his slowly devolving mental state is beautifully executed and pays off brilliantly.¬†\n\nDespite the director's prowess and the incredible script, a lot of the film relies on the cast. Thankfully, everyone seems to have decided to save their best performances for this film. Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow and Luke Wilson play the three children and are each amazing in their portrayals. Ben Stiller, especially, shows a maturity of performance and depth that you won't find in the likes of Zoolander, as well as finding the humour in every situation. In many ways he is the straight man to a lot of the cast, especially his father. Speaking of whom, Gene Hackman plays Royal, the eccentric/borderline insane patriach of the Tenenbaums. Estranged from his wife and childre, Royal is running out of money and so takes to deception to win his way back into the family. Hackman's performance in the film is one of those that you only get once every ten years. He is at once loveable and detestable, sympathetic and despicable and so much larger than the screen he's on. He brings an air of gravitas to the role which makes him believable and enigmatic. It's a brilliant performance which combines a keen comedic sense with a bombastic disposition and he pulls it off without a single bum note. Gwyneth Paltrow's performance is strangely restrained, lacking the charming smile which has gained her fans worldwide, trading it in for an almost bored quality where everything is unnecessary and a chore to get through. Even though she has a long line of fantastic films, her performance here is so beautifully measured, this may be her best. Luke Wilson's Richie is fantastic as well, though he doesn't have the emotional moment which many of the other roles are afforded. Where Hackman's deception finally gives way to true emotion, Stiller's rage gives way to breaking down and Paltrow's disconnection gives way to feelings, Wilson's zen-like attitude doesn't give way, visibly, to any specific emotion. Despite his \"needle in the hay\" scene having great impact emotionally, his detached sensibility stays intact, outwardly, throughout everything. This makes his performance all the more impressive as the emotion which occassionally leaks out speaks volumes as to what's going on underneath. It's a tribute to his performance that we are able to see this happening at all. The rest of the cast turn in fantastic supporting roles, especially Bill Murray and Anjelica Huston. Owen Wilson also turns a great performance, as does Danny Glover. The ensemble nature of the film means that each performance has its own specific nuance which can be appreciated more and more on repeat viewings.¬†\n\nAnderson's use of music in the film is fantastically diverse and inventive to a fault. Beginning with the Mutato Muzika Orchestra's version of Hey Jude, the songs become more eclectic as the film goes on, but not for the sake of being diverse in itself. Each song works within the crux of the scene, adding emotion and atmosphere equally. Soundtrack standouts include Needle in the Hay by Elliot Smith and Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard by Paul Simon.¬†\n\nThe Royal Tenenbaums is beautifully planned, designed and executed and only gets better after repeat viewings. Having Alec Baldwin as a narrator doesn't hurt either.¬†\n\nDefining Scene:¬†\nIt's a toss up between the bathroom scene and the ending montage but I'm going to say the ending for sheer emotional weight.",

            "content": "With Wes Anderson directing and Gene Hackman in a Golden Globe Award winning role, The Royal Tennenbaums sounded like a stylish feature.\n\nThe general style that Wes Anderson uses to approach The Royal Tennenbaums seems very similar to the one he used on his 2014 multiple Academy Award nominated film The Grand Budapest Hotel, only with less absurdity this time around. The story is a lot more down to earth although without an absence of darker themes. Although I didn't find the film to be perfect, The Royal Tennenbaums is clearly a step in the right direction for Wes Anderson. But the story just didn't end up doing the job for me. It may have been eccentric and stylish at the time of its release in 2002, but considering how far Wes Anderson has come since The Royal Tennenbaums the film seems largely like an experimental feature and a good one too, but I didn't exactly feel like it ended up doing the job for me.\nThere are so many characters in The Royal Tennenbaums who all have their own stories to tell. Because of that, the film unfolds in the manner of many subplots occuring one after the other. Since all of them have their own absurdist nature, it makes the somewhat scattered narrative structure even more difficult to swallow. I've been able to embrace Wes Anderson films before, but it's difficult to tell where he wants the absurdity to lie in The Royal Tennenbaums because the subject matter is grim yet the film is light in nature and therefore fails to have any really effective dramatic moments. There are times where it could have done so, but I felt like it failed to follow up on them. The large collection of characters in The Royal Tennenbaums resulted in an inconsistent rate of success with me because I was intrigued by some of them while not so much interested in others. And since they all measured up with fairly equal amounts of screen time aside from the protagonist Royal Tennenbaum, the structure of the film is equal even though the general sense of entertainment value can be hit and miss. For me, there was more misses than hits because the limited capabilities of the story failed match up to the style of the film yet I was already very familiar with that style through Wes Anderson's later works. There may be nostalgia in The Royal Tennenbaums, but his sense of style cannot overcome the inconsistent storytelling success in the film even if there is a general sense of charm going on in the film.\nWhile the stories in The Royal Tennenbaums may not be structured perfectly, the screenplay in the feature is rich with strong dialogue and some intriguing characters to boot. This gives the film some sense of value beneath its style, but the fact is that The Royal Tennenbaums will always stand out more for its absurdist nature and the way that it is depicted. With stylish cinematography, Wes Anderson gives The Royal Tennenbaums a really eccentric feel to it. With quick but gentle editing of the many strange situations and variety of beautiful scenery in the film as well as a nice soundtrack , The Royal Tennenbaums reveals itself as an effective treat on the eyes and the ears without deviating too far from being somewhat realistic even if the story is of a very absurd nature.\nThe atmosphere in the film felt rather strange in a way. At times there was a lighthearted sense of joy which covered the main feel of the film while at many other moments there was a sense of drama which didn't exactly work too well with the absurdist themes because on a certain level they just clashed and left things feeling somewhat strange. I liked some parts of the themes in The Royal Tennenbaums but the tone felt inconsistent to me, never exactly resting on being light or dark and therefore not maximising the comic potential of it all. Like The Royal Tennenbaums, I never really knew how to feel.\nStill, the one thing that is undeniably an asset in The Royal Tennenbaums is the ensemble cast.\nGene Hackman's performance is a really great change of pace for the actor. The Two Time Academy Award winning legend delivers such an offbeat and eccentric role in The Royal Tennenbaums where he restricts himself mainly to how he delivers his lines instead of his physical actions, and in a role much different to his legendary dramatic efforts, Gene Hackman delivers a touching and simple yet charismatic performance as Royal Tennenbaum. He makes a likable figure out of his character even if some of his approaches to situations are not precisely the most healthy. He always has a likable demeanour to him and his interactions with all the other cast members create strong chemistry. Gene Hackman's leading performance in The Royal Tennenbaums is his final great performance and one of his most gentle and restrained, and he manages to grasp Wes Anderson's distinctive tone and intergrate it into his character which reveals that he is the ideal lead actor to be working with the director.\nWhile none of the other cast members stand out like Gene Hackman, the supporting cast remain a talented bunch.\nBen Stiller's energy easily matches the mood of the film, and the same goes for Owen Wilson and Bill Murray who is always a welcomn presence in a Wes Anderson feature. Danny Glover is good to see active, Anjelica Huston is strong in conveying her introverted nature and Gwyneth Paltrow follows in her footsteps with a rather dark nature to her and a strong chemsitry with Luke Wilson.\n\nSo The Royal Tennenbaums shows the strongly stylish nature of Wes Anderson's directorial style and the cast are all on board with him without problem, but the scattered story and surplus of characters makes it a challenge to keep up with and the overall development doesn't feel great.",

            "content": "Review In A Nutshell:\n\nI have seen countless films about family and the dysfunction that arises when relationships and personalities are mismatched. Noah Baumbach's The Squid and the Whale was a recently seen example of a film that captures the honesty of parental dysfunction and separation. Wes Anderson's The Royal Tenenbaums may not even show half of that honesty, but it does something much more difficult. It blends in the quirkiness and hilarity of a typical Anderson film and mixes it with a story that is fuelled by genuine emotional problems and vulnerability that none of Anderson's films have been able to achieve.\n\nThe film acts as the dawn of Wes Anderson's signature style, where its large cast of characters are accompanied by a star-studded ensemble cast, production and technical designs that shape the director's visionary world, and a premise that either attempts to be ambitious in its storytelling or its themes. With each film, starting from his debut, he has gained much more confidence in achieving his true vision; showing less fear in incorporating unorthodox influences in shaping the characters and their world. The Royal Tenenbaums may not be Anderson's most inspiring of works, as compared to The Grand Budapest Hotel and Moonrise Kingdom, this film is quite tame; but as I have said neither of his films have achieved the emotional grandiose that this film was able to bring. Watching not only Wes, but also Owen Wilson grow as a writer from Bottle Rocket was an amazing journey; when both collaborate, they create ambitious stories with a sense of balance. It's like as if Wilson keeps Anderson in track and ensures that the characters are given the same amount of respect as the world and tone that he is creating. Anderson's last two films, Moonrise and Budapest, have been examples of escapist films that do not actually carry a hefty amount of characterisation, or at least Anderson's prominent facade has covered them to the point where we end up forgetting that we are watching humans and not cartoon characters.\n\nThe Royal Tenenbaums starts off by giving the audience a brief history of the family, showing their successes and pitfalls. It shows at the end of this recount, each of the family members√¢(TM) lives 22 years later, exposing the emotional damage that characters carry, which many are rooted from the fracture of their parents√¢(TM) marriage. Each family member resents their father, Royal, due to the criticising and self-absorbed nature of his personality; I immediately found this relatable as I suffer circumstances in my daily life, but not to the extent that Anderson has given to his characters. The film's driving moment shortly comes with Royal stating to his wife, Etheline, that he is \"dying\" in a matter of weeks and that he needs to be with his family again during this process. I found this premise to be immediately empathetic as I feel strong towards the idea of a man trying to keep or reunite his family together, regardless of the flaws that he inherently carries. It sounds so serious on the way I describe it, but in actuality, Anderson has made quite a hilarious film with its emotional storyline. I simply chose to acknowledge the serious emotional depth that the director has given to the story, as it is something I am extremely fond of.\n\nThe film does not place all of its eggs on one basket of course, the film also spends an equal amount of time fleshing out each member of the cast, especially in regards to Royal's three children; Chas, Margot and Richie. There are subplots that linger behind the core storyline, that enrich the personalities of its characters. Margot in particular was the most fascinating, with Anderson giving a brief segments midway in the film that describes an exhaustive history of her troubled adventures, developed vices and sexual partners. It also helps that her relationship with her father is the most complex and most damaged, out of the three; there were actually multiple moments where I cannot help but sympathise for her instead of Royal, despite him being the film's central protagonist. Richie's character is the film's most grounded character, there is very little about him that we could actually say is quirky, aside from maybe his romantic relationship and choice of subjects for painting. His character provides the darkest elements of the film, and without that contribution to the story, this film wouldn't have any dire stakes that could actually further damage the foundations of the family. There is a scene about an hour into the film, where he does something drastic; that genuinely one of the scariest moments I have ever seen in a film, something about it felt so real and it contrasts so heavily with its mostly chirpy tone and atmosphere. Chas on the other hand is Anderson's more typical of characters, featuring a difficult father-son relationship that is also inherent in all of Anderson's other films; but at least here, he intertwines it with his relationship to other members of the family, rather than it standing on its own.\n\nCharacters outside the core family are mainly used as added members in pushing the film's complications, but thankfully Anderson and Wilson do not write these characters in a shallow, one-dimensional note, they actually feel fleshed out and through that we are able to care about their own problems, even just for a little.\n\nThe film overall acts as a metaphor of the famous families that live among us, with the general public thinking that they live a peaceful, happy, and wonderful life, and people cannot help but feel envious towards them. True, these people did gain success from their talented abilities, but they only developed these abilities due to the suffering they had to endure. Artists and entrepreneurs only finds success when their emotional and psychological foundations are rocky; they are determined to smooth out the groundwork through their financial and artistic profits, but in reality they only end up acting as facades and that these type of issues could only be remedied when properly confronted; and all it takes is one person from that family to do something about it.\n\nThe Royal Tenenbaums carry the traditional camera work that is present in his previous film, Rushmore; but now it is more prominent than before, with its use of wide lenses, fast pull-ins and pull-outs, zipping tilts and pans, and shots that are even more symmetrical. These are the core visual trademarks of a Wes Anderson/Robert Yeoman film, without these that essence would be lost and the humour that they try to create would most likely not be as effective. Mark Mothersbaugh comes back to do the score once again, and this time along with Anderson's overall vision, it has grown from his previous film. With each film, it seems that his score becomes more sophisticated in order to keep up with Anderson and Wilson's ambitious stories and characters. He was able to bring that emotional impact into his music that is needed in order to sell the relationships and vulnerabilities of its characters. The soundtrack also has gone through some improvements, also showing a sense of sophistication to the styles and popularity to Anderson's choices. The soundtrack now incorporates legendary artists like The Clash, The Beatles, Bob Dylan and Paul Simon, but what truly stood out was the inclusion of Nico; whom which I have personal attachments with due to her debut solo album and her collaboration with one of my favourite bands of all time The Velvet Underground. Nico songs like These Days and Fairest of the Seasons were used so well, elevating the scene's emotional ambiance and providing a sense of elegance to the visuals.\n\nLike with any Wes Anderson film, the cast does a wonderful job in inhabiting their characters; and whilst under Anderson's direction, we are able to see sides of these actors that we never thought existed. Who knew Gene Hackman and Gwyneth Paltrow would work so well in an Anderson film? Speaking of Hackman, he was a damn revelation in this film. It showed another side of the actor that I was not familiar with; I have always connected him with his legendary dark, gritty and serious roles like in Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation. Though the actor has been seen in light works including The Birdcage and Superman, but they don't even come close to what he has brought as Royal Tenenbaum. I could have this review run for another nine paragraphs if you want me to dissect each and every other cast member in this film, but that would have been unnecessary as I have similar feelings towards all of them. Each actor or actresses brings so much to their performances, despite the light and comedic nature of their roles.\n\nThe Royal Tenenbaums is a one of a kind film for writers Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson, exposing more of emotion and pain into their characters, elevating them from the cartoon tendencies that Anderson normally brings to his films. Very few capture the essence of the drama in family dysfunction, even fewer do it with the sense of artistry that Wes Anderson brings to the film.",

It's got enough quirk for two films, which is exactly the films problem -\nthe storytelling feels chopped and unsmooth after too much calcuated eccentricities in the characters. In writing, it's taught you cut the overflowery language in favor of more subtle \nwriting devices like inference and letting the reader learn the characters through reflection on them. The Royal Tenebaum film scribbles each characters personality trait right on their clothings\n and this makes for a less fun experience, not to mention there are few characters to actually grapple on to. Royal Tenenbaum being one, and Chas' sons as well, even if they are minor characters.\nMargot remains interesting, but is never explained fully. The characters are built to be this way by Wes Anderson via his auteur style, but when the story never gets off the ground like Moonrise Kingdom, then\nhaving flat characters is a gamble, and in this case, one that never fully pays off. Regardless, Wes Anderson's style is unique enough to warrant a watch, even if it never takes off, it doesn't look half bad running off the ground.",

The performance of Gene Hackman is terrific, complimented perfectly by the name-brand cast around him.  This is a marvelous film.",

Some characters were interesting, but somehow Anderson manages to make them dislikable and cut off most emotional attachment he had built up. And yet most the other characters were downright disikable the entire length of the movie (especially Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson's characters). The color palette and directorial prowess make it very easy to watch, but the script keeps you from getting invested or having nearly as much fun as so many other Wes Anderson films manage to be. 3.5/5",

Everydetail in his films is hyper-stylized and affected in a way utterly unique, which I guess is the point, which makes his films suck in a manner and to a level only his movies can suck.  I especially hate how he takes great actors and reduces them to a collection of quirk-laden caricatures who mug through the movie in a manner which makes Cary Elwes' pantomime act in \"The Princess Bride\" look utterly real by comparison.  I don't understand how people like his movies in the least, but there are actually people out there who have said this one (and others in his catalogue) changed their lives.  How?  Did they get a new haircut? Change cigarette brands?  I would rather watch every Transformer movie back to back than watch another Wes Anderson film. His filmmaking is the embodiment of much that is wrong with hip, upper class \"White\" culture.    He may be a nice guy, if he is I like that.  It would be wrong to have anything against him as a human being.  I'd just like him to try a different profession.",

The set designs are typically genius, and the cast and acting is top-notch, but the main problem with this movie lies within it's story. It's all over the place, and has pacing issues. Worst of all, in my opinion, is how it becomes needlessly dark during the 75 minute mark. Wes Anderson is way out of his depth during this twenty minutes of relentlessly graphic suicide attempts and hospitalizations. Although I believe he can include such topics in his films and that he has every right to, it simply does not go well with this film's cheerful, lackadaisical aesthetic. This is the same problem I have with THE LIFE AQUATIC; it's pleasant and charming until all of a sudden, it's ridiculously dark and cruel for no reason other than pure pretentiousness. I love Wes Anderson's films and am one of his biggest fans, but this one does not have high replay value and is not one of my favorites.",

It's comedy relies on the sustained joke that all of these characters have their own odd personalities and obsessions. This wears thin pretty quickly and there are hardly any actual jokes in it. The themes of depression, death, obsession and broken down relationships does not leave much room for humour; therefore, this represents rather a dull affair than an enjoyable comedy.",

This director exerts an unmistakable cinematic style and reveals great attention to detail in all aspects that might influence the mise-en-scene and the expressive quality of the movie, scenery, sound, camera and editing work, cinematography, soundtrack, costumes and even the acting are all conditioned by the formal etiquette of the direction, technical virtuosity serving a somewhat baroque aesthetical sensibility that might not be to everyone's taste. Manneristic Cinema is how the work of this American director has been described. I find it a very appealing style and I think it has great potential to be interestingly developed in future works. Very funny and interesting the way that Wes carves his characters, not being exactly caricatures they have somewhat restricted behavioral patterns and eccentricity, yet they display a certain degree of complexity and this brings out psychological and emotional nuances that escape perception in many other films, but enhance the dramatic and comic effect of Wes Cinema. Artificial or not, the characters make perfect sense the way they are, that's the way they have to be. This film genre is not usually very interesting to me, but Wes Anderson stylized and bittersweet comedy offered me moments of pleasure and was music for my eyes (and ears), the only thing that I didn't care for was the story itself, Wes style and writing works very well to develop these humorous family tales, but it still seemed redundant to me, perhaps a good platform of cinematic experimentation for those starting out. \"The Royal Tenenbaums\" is worth a watch for those who enjoy these witty and tender comedies, Wes style fits like a glove in this genre and enriches it with a different cinematic quality.",

Wes Anderson has a distinctive directing style, one that is absolutely unique and engaging. I've seen quite a few of his films, and The Royal Tenenbaums is one of his best, and it boasts some great performances matched with an engaging storyline. Anderson fans will surely enjoy this, and like I've, it's one of his best movies and he displays his skills perfectly here. With this film, Wes Anderson seems to be even more confident behind the camera, and therefore he tells a more thought out and memorable storyline. Anderson is a great filmmaker, and he deserves more praise than what he gets, and film lovers should appreciate his work for what it is. What I mean by that is that many people won't even take a glance at his work, and easily dismiss it because of the somewhat eccentric way he makes his movies. I think it's a great shame because his films are very original, and each one becomes even more thought out than the previous one. The Royal Tenenbaums is a fine drama comedy that showcases the talents of a unique and original filmmaker perfectly. With Wes Anderson, you never know what type of film you'll get, but there will always be his signature style of having whimsical characters stuck in bizarre situations with each movie. That's what makes work worth seeing, and if you're not familiar with his work, this is a perfect place to start, along with Moonrise Kingdom.

            "content": "*THE OFFICIAL CUTLER SEAL OF APPROVAL* \n*THE OFFICIAL BETTER THAN JUNO SEAL*\n*THE OFFICIAL BEST FILM OF THE 2000 DECADE*\n\nWes Anderson's The Royal Tenebaums has some very outstanding things going on in it.  Anderson's first film \"Bottle Rocket\" opened to critical acclaim, but I wasn't impressed at all.  Then, I watched his second film called \"Rushmore\", which was another disappointment.  Both would be given a 4/10 and 3/10, respectively.  I guess this is proof of the old saying, \"Third time's the charm.\" because the Royal Tenenbaums is not only my favorite Wes Anderson film-his career went on an upward slope from here-but it's one of my favorite films of all time.  It is often labelled as a comedy, but I prefer to think of it as a drama....a very, very dark drama.  A talent like Anderson's reminds me of another director-Spike Jonze.  \n\nSo what is the Royal Tenenbaums about?  Well, it's about a man named-well-Royal Tenenbaum, played by Gene Hackman.  He was (HINT: Was) a very successful lawyer with 3 children and a wife.  His three children are Chas (Ben Stiller), Richie (Luke Wilson), and Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow).  Chas and Richie are the biological children of Royal while Margot is adopted.  Well, Royal abandons his family and everyone is an a**hole to each other.  Richie and Margot have a secret relationship with each other (Is that incest, or not?), but Margot is unhappily married to Bill Murray's character (forgot his name).  Chas is stingy with money and has two weird looking sons.  And Royal's wife, Etheline (played by Anjelica Huston), is engaged to Henry Sherman (played by the-one-the-only Danny Glover).  Owen Wilson pops up in and around a couple of times, but he's more of the comic relief.  \n\nThe Royal Tenenbaums is very funny.  I know I'm contradicting what I said in the first paragraph, but it is super hilarious.  It has excellent lines, such as \"Is it dark?\" \"Of Course it's dark.  It's a suicide note.\"  Okay, that doesn't seem funny when written down, but it's handled well in the film.  The script is amazing, even though it does the most overrated form of telling a story: Narration.  But that's the thing!  Everything works in this film.  Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson deserved an Oscar that year (Not sure who won for screenplay in '02), but who even cares about the Oscar's anymore?  This year, they were apparently the least watched TV program of the year.  That makes me smile with delight. \n\nAlso, this film is excellently acted.  The entire cast was on fire.  Owen Wilson may get trashed on for his recent films, like the Internship.  However, the guy has a genuine sense of comedy.  Plus, I guess everyone chose to forget about Midnight in Paris, but that's just the mindless masses.  Ben Stiller, who I don't like as a comedian, is amazing here.  He's hilarious, often doing his weird, awkward comedy style, but that works here too.  Danny Glover doesn't even need to be praised.  He's practically perfect here.  Luke Wilson provides some funny lines, and he had the hardest role to pull off, considering the one scene I don't want to spoil.  However, it was probably my favorite scene in cinema history.  Gwyneth Paltrow plays the role she was born to play: a bitch.  I guess it  wasn't acting considering she really is one, so I will always find a way to put her down.  Matter of fact, she is the reason I can't give this film a 10/10.  She's just.....annoying.  Anjelica Huston provides a sweet role as mother Tenenbaum.  She deserves every amount of praise as Wilson, considering it was another tough role.  Then, who could forget Gene Hackman's performance as Royal Tenenbaum.  I could go on and on about his performance, but I really have a time limit.  In short, it's amazing, if not spectacular.  Whoever did the casting for this film deserves a cookie!  \n\nOverall, the R. Tenenbaums has some outstanding things going on in it.  Wes Anderson proves he's no joke, even though he did direct Darjeerling Limited.  I would give that a 4.5/10.  But here he made an absolute classic.  It's expertly acted, has one of the greatest screenplays written (Yes, it might be better than Tarantino's Pulp Fiction), and is well executed.  Everything about this film is near perfect.  If only Gwyneth Paltrow was given a lesser role or maybe no role at all, this would be my favorite film of all time, dethroning Before Sunrise.  Unfortunately, while the casting director did a great job, he/she messed up one character.  However, that's a minor complaint because this is my second favorite film of all time.\n\n9.5/10",

Also Fantastic Mr. Fox slips way ahead of both of them. I am not far into his filmography, but I like where I am going. \n\nVisually, Tenenbaums is a painting. The detail in production design is extraordinary. Every color and prop has its place. \n\nThe characters are so well presented you can't help but know what they are thinking at any given moment.

Featuring a bevy of actors who would continue to work for Anderson throughout the rest of his movies (as well as Bill Murray and Owen Wilson, two mainstays that perfectly capture the mood and insanity of Anderson's stories), this movie stands on its own as a critical (and general) audience favorite. 5/5 Uninterestingly enough, I feel this was Anderson's artistic peak, as I can't say I've enjoyed any of his movies since this one as much as I did the trifecta of his first three: Bottle Rocket, Rushmore, and this unique achievement of artistry.

Although it may be categorized as comedy, it is more dramatic than humorous. It does pack some pretty good laughs though. I would recommend it.",

The movie has a great cast with the like's of Bill Murray , Gene Hackman, Owen Wilson, Gwyneth Paltrow , and Luke Wilson who all give wonderful performances. If you do not like Anderson's offbeat humor( which I Do) there still are some hilarious lough out loud moments. The story is brilliantly written by Anderson and is perfectly narrated by Baldwin. One thing I liked about the movie is Royal and all the Tenenbaum children and relatives have their own story to add to the main plot, so you never get bored with the movie. I highly recommend this movie and all the other Anderson films. If you have to see one film by Wes Anderson, Rushmore or this is the one (I prefer this film).",

Royal, Ethel, and Henry are all very relatable and do have interesting story arcs that teach each of them something, and i love the message that this movie has.

Quirky, sad, funny, dark and light, TRT is a ride that many filmgoers will appreciate, though the story does not have much of a real structure, replaced rather by ever-expanding branches of relationships, family drama and arguments. It is the classic Anderson \"storybook\" style of narration matched with the quiet, depressing dialogues with dry witty undertone that give TRT it's distinct character. All the performances are good, but for me it's Hackman and Stiller who steal the show, the latter of which proving to be an exceptional dramatic actor in this work.

            "content": "Something happens in that moment when Margot Tenenbaum (Gwyneth Paltrow) steps off the Green Line bus and the soft strum of Nico's \"These Days\" flutters.  Light suddenly fills her space, and time drags as she comes back to Richie (Luke Wilson), the brother she hasn't seen in years.  Each step feels eternal and Richie watches unmoving, his impassive gaze telling us far more than any dialogue or exposition.  It's a towering moment, showing us a director with, among many, many other talents, the ability to construct beautiful cinema.  Character, setting, light, sound, time; all just elements that Wes Anderson has blended to a moment glancing at perfection.  It can take your breath away.\n\nThe Royal Tenenbaums, like Salinger's Glasses, are a family past their prime.  Their childhood genius, once renowned, has long since been swept under the carpet to be replaced by dysfunction far more intriguing.  The siblings have parted and the tarnish on the family name is too thick to clear.  It is only when the estranged father, Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) has nowhere else to go that the family find themselves, for perhaps the first time, resembling something nuclear.  All under the same roof, the Tenenbaums have little choice but to attempt some sort of cohesion, taking as roundabout a way as they possibly can to forgiveness, to acceptance, to a future not clinging to the past.\n\nWes Anderson is a bag of tricks kind of director, using elements like soundtrack and color and symmetry to impose his own aesthetic.  While there's no denying his talent, it's his consistency that can split opinion.  Some feel he's too wrapped up in his own style to breach the upper echelon, others think him progressive.  I happen to be one of the latter, but that's not apropos to my point, which is this: aside from everything else, aside from the tricks and the vintage clothing shop tableau and the (phenomenal) soundtracks, Wes Anderson is simply a great writer.  I'll admit that he does himself a disservice shrouding his story in so much prettiness.  The face value of this film is considerable and by it's very nature, writing tends to go unnoticed.  But in digging beneath the surface of Royal Tenenbaums, you find such well-written dialogue, such well-constructed scenes, that from that point onward it's nearly all you can see.  I would describe this writing as graceful both because it seems to work so effortlessly and because it doesn't do all the work.  This is the mark of a strong writer; the ability to let not only dialogue have it's time, but silence as well.  In another moment of brilliance, Anderson finds Margot and Richie lying together on a cot, in a tent he constructed within the Tenenbaum home.  This is a key plot point and an especially difficult scene to navigate for it's content, but Anderson thrives, letting brief dialogue and reticence work together, conveying much more than five minutes of pure conversation.\n\nLet's return to his other abilities as a director though, shall we?  Clearly he's obsessed with symmetry, often placing subjects in the center of a frame and allowing the empty space, much like the things left unsaid, to work.  He's kind of a portrait cinematographer with how often his characters are facing the camera, as can be seen in the beautiful title sequence of this film.  And the color, oh the color.  Wes Anderson plays in palettes like any other artist, giving everything a treatment that leaves it somehow both antique and endlessly cared for.  The Tenenbaum home is a beautiful hodge podge of portraits, paintings, found items and color.  Which leads me to yet another quality very few directors can claim to rival: the attention to detail.  It's nothing short of astonishing how far he goes in setting a scene, from the Margot portraits by young Richie to the bizarre paintings on Eli Cash's (Owen Wilson) walls to the battered Taxis roaming the streets.  It could easily be called overstated, but there's something about this obsessive detail that shows you how much this director cares.  Nothing is too much, and that, to me, is very refreshing.\n\nIn my opinion, this is Wes Anderson's best film (Fantastic Mr. Fox a close second).  His work occasionally suffers when Wes lets the bright and shiny parts get away from him.  It can let the more important stuff fall by the wayside and leave us more impressed with his style than his substance.  The Royal Tenenbaums is his best work because the balance never tips in one direction.  The look is there in abundance, that Wes Anderson polish that has become so familiar, but the story and the characters are first and foremost, as they should be.  And with this harmony, Wes Anderson has constructed a film I'll be watching for many years to come.",

The movie has a great story and great narration by Alec Baldwin. The movie tells about how Royal Tenenbaum fakes dying to reunite with his wife and three prodigal children.

            "content": "Undeniably Wes Anderson's masterpiece, \"The Royal Tenebaums\" achieves everything little thing it sets out to do, and instead of being excessively busy, it always hits the right note.  Many of Anderson's films have fell flat. in my opinion.  Some of them are almost TOO whimsical, while others focus on characters that are nothing more than a cartoon of a person.  But this time, every single shot rings pitch-perfect.  Anderson, who by this time knew exactly what he was capable of, hits the right balance-- while creating eccentric characters (such as Owen Wilson's \"cowboy\" Eli Cash, or Ben Stiller's jump-suited Chas Tenenbaum), and putting us into a world that belongs in a comic book, Anderson and writing partner, Wilson, flesh out a simple scenario and make it consistently witty and interesting, something most dysfunctional family dramas can never do.  This film is usually billed as a comedy, but instead we're led to an offbeat drama where anything whimsical or exaggerated is like a backdrop.  We're so intently focused on these characters, none of whom are cut-outs, and soon enough we end up caring in some way or another, regardless of any decision they've made.  The writing is so brilliant that it's easy to see everyone's perspective-- it shows how much at that time Anderson and Wilson had really matured from their \"Rushmore\" days.  \"The Royal Tenenbaums\" may feature a star-studded-- if not star-FILLED cast-- but the names aren't the only thing that makes this film so excellent.  This is a brilliant movie that should be seen.  Highly recommended.",

It presents, in a utmost funny way, how burnt out child prodigies struggle to communicate with each other, unraveling all their hidden desires and fears.

The main ingredient here that I think just elevates this into the realm of greatness is, of course, Gene Hackman, in a Golden Globe winning role as Royal. He should have at least been nominated for an Oscar, in my opinion.

Bill Murray should've had more screen time but is great on screen, to be honest it's hard to praise everyone as they are all equally good, it's one of the finest performances in a comedy drama for a long time.

All of the characters are likeable and really interesting in their own ways, my favorite ones being Gene Hackman and Ben Stiller. Both Wilson brothers give some of their strongest performances as well as Ben Stiller and the rest of the cast, but the best performance in the movie definitely comes from Gene Hackman as the father that let his kids down for not being there for them.

Arguably Anderson's most popular movie, The Royal Tenenbaums focuses on a family for which extraordinariness is the ordinary, eccentricity the everyday, and Anderson's whimsicality and colorfulness in direction vividly reflects the Tenenbaum family's characteristics. With popping visuals, creative editing, and imaginative characters, the movie provides lots of fun to be had, though some, as in the case of yours truly, may not be overly impressed by one thing in particular: the surprising lack of laughs Anderson is known to have produced in his audience with enviable ease. Compared to Anderson's other movies, especially The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, The Royal Tenenbaums is not nearly as funny, and the off-the-wall comedy feels at times too off-the-wall, if not forced and pretentious, but then again, humor is subjective.",

And if The Royal Tenenbaums is anything to go on, I've really been missing out.\n\nI think this might be the flagship film in a subgenre of comedy I've dubbed \"intelligent comedy.\" The comedy is misplaced, sometimes dark, most of it is never spoken, that is its in the scenery and cinematography, and chuckle inducing at best in lieu of laugh out loud. It may not be to all tastes, and you won't like everything you see, but if you're in the mood to watch a clever, quirky, funny movie, and not lose yourself in stifling laughter, this film hits the nail on the head.\n\nThere is an essence of considerable time and money put into this film. Describing the unique nature of this film is difficult to explain without overusing using the word quirky. Wes Anderson's directing style reminds me of Paul Thomas Anderson's (no relation) directing style if that means anything to you. He captures dysfunctional characters in their natural habitat excellently. It's a brilliantly successful blend of tongue-in-cheek comedy and drama that come together sublimely.\n\nAs with movies that are painstakingly well put together, at best it'll beguile its adherents, but it will never wow them because there's no risk. This isn't really a criticism, more of an insight into how my mind works. Most comedies have intermittent periods of intense hilarity with down time in between. This film is less intense, but keeps the humor consistent throughout the whole film. What I'm trying to say is, on average, this is one the best comedies out there.",

The quirky family has a lot of character in it, doing a lot to help separate all of the characters. As I said earlier, the script is very funny at times, and has a lot of heart to its comedy, and the dramatic bits are genuinely dramatic. It√¢(TM)s nothing that will make you cry, but the drama is, like the comedy, played with a lot of heart to it. A lot of this heart seems to come from the well-placed soundtrack and timing of a lot of what happens. There is not too much else that i can say about it. The large cast pays off well, and does a lot to separate themselves so that you get to know them, the soundtrack is good, the script is done well, and overall, the film just has heart and quirk, which all help the film.",

The Royal Tenenbaums came off of his success with Rushmore and the little seen Bottle Rocket, so this is his first time with such a large cast and a bit more scope and production value at his disposal. It certainly doesn't go to waste either. The cast is perfect, even Ben Stiller, who I'm not much of a fan of on-screen. Everyone does good work in this film, and the story is very charming and off-beat. Just look at the cast: there's Gene Hackman, Danny Glover, Anjelica Huston, Bill Murray, Luke Wilson, Owen Wilson, Gwyneth Paltrow and Ben Stiller. It was kind of underappreciated when it was first released, not totally, but enough to notice. I think in the years since, especially after The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou and the revival of a lot of the cast from this movie in that movie, I think it has grown in stature a bit. It's not his best, but that's like trying to pick a favorite child anyway. All of his films are great and they manage to nevert disappoint, especially this one.",

The film follows the Tenenbaums, a family of prodigies that fell on hard times but comes together when their father, Royal, is given 6 weeks to live.  The cast that Anderson has put together is phenomenal; Gene Hackman, Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow, Luke Wilson, Owen Wilson, and Bill Murray.  All the characters have richness and depth to them, making the story all the more captivating.  And the comedy is just so clever and sly, that it's hard not to be taken in.  The Royal Tenenbaums is a smart and fun character drama that's immensely entertaining.",

I found The Royal Tennenbaums to be a bit too dry and clever for its own good, but for the most part I enjoyed its witty script and talented cast. The film is something of a mess, but it's a mess that is worth watching at least once.",

I didn't find it as funny as Anderson's sophomore bout 'Rushmore', but the Tenenbaums exceed that film with its melancholic punch and emotional relevance.

Now, that being said, that isn't actually a bad thing. Yes, very quirky, and at times quite funny, but mostly, what this movie has is heart. An amazing ensemble cast led by Gene Hackman, all the acting performances in this movie are top notch. Anjelica Huston and Danny Glover can always be relied on for great performances. Ben Stiller and the Wilson brothers took this chance to stray away from the normal types of comedies they do, and they did a fantastic job. Gwyneth Paltrow was almost unrecognizable, as Margot, the character who does not crack a smile the entire film. I'm not even kidding. Also, the visual style is really cool. It is obvious that Anderson wanted it to look like the family was all stuck in the 70s-a time when all the kids were at their best. Overall, I really enjoyed this movie, that is yes, a little quirky and eccentric, but one that movie lovers should not miss",

This film is often considered a comedy, but don't go in to this movie expecting a lot of laughs, but rather a broad range of emotions that could leave you laughing and tearing up at the same time. Tenenbaums is a much more serious endeavor than anderson's previous two films, and it carries much deeper themes and more tragic characters, which makes the ultimate catharsis that much more rewarding. One more note, the symbolism in this movie is superb but requires multiple viewings to catch all of it. Conclusion: if you appreciate films and/or have a quirky sense of humor, then you will certainly enjoy this film",

It s hard to tell what it is since on a technical point everything is very well made with a fine screenplay and acting .Its perhaps the way the feeling has been described.Somehow the character doesn't relate enough to us which is different from what he did in Rushmore.Further the story itself seems too light in the way it is told even though it remain well made and pleasant.

            "content": "Director Wes Anderson and his longtime writing partner and friend Owen Wilson follow up Bottle Rocket, and Rushmore with this offbeat comedy about a dysfunctional family reunion. The Royal Tenenbaums is very similar to Anderson's previous two movies. The only difference is that he does everything he had accomplished in his two other movies even better in this one. The Royal Tenenbaums is Wes Anderson best movie.\r\n\r\nRoyal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) was an extremely successful attorney who had three children with his wife Etheline (Anjelica Huston), she is an archaeologist. Each of the Tenenbaum kids was pretty much a genius: Chas (Ben Stiller) made a killing as a child investor. Richie (Luke Wilson) was a junior tennis champ and a three time U.S. Nationals winner. The adopted Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) was a playwright who won a 50,000 dollar Braverman Grant in the ninth grade. When Royal abruptly left his family however, it was the beginning of two decades of betrayal and epic failure that would scar the Tenenbaums for the rest of there life's. Their past loathing are bitterly held against Royal when he suddenly reappears, claiming to have six weeks to live. He strongly desire's to reconnect with his now broken family. Typically Royal's story is a sham, but his presence and sincere desire for absolution soon have a very strong effect on the Tenenbaums, who are each dealing with thwarted desires and relationships. Among them are Richie's lifelong love for Margot, who's unhappily married to Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray). There is also Etheline's eccentric engagement to Henry Sherman (Danny Glover), he wishes to marry her. One other character is Eli Cash (Owen Wilson), he lived across the street from the Tenenbaum's and became like part of the family. Eli writes very successful western books that get very bad reviews.\r\n\r\nThis movie didn't look like much to me. I went in with very low expectations, I was surprised by how good it actually turned out to be. Like I said, this is an offbeat comedy. Anderson specializes in that type of movies. The movie is just brilliant, at the center of this movie we get a character study. The character study is well executed, and excellently thought out. Every single character is developed extremely well, and it's shown in a very clever way. The movie begins on a high note. It starts with an introduction of all of the characters, this was a major highlight of the movie. I also enjoy how the movie is divided into chapters. It gives everything a nice touch, they structure it kind of like a book. Alec Baldwin does the narration, they could not have picked a better actor for this job. Just like in other Anderson movies, there is a very large attention to detail, even though the main attention is being focused on the characters. The costume design and art direction is specific throughout. A good example is the house they all live in. The house could have been a character all on it's own, there are tons of pictures everywhere, and specific character identifying settings. Now for the cast.\r\n\r\nLuke Wilson shines brilliantly here by giving one of his best performances. Luke Wilson plays a dark character, and he just plays him to perfection. Gwyneth Paltrow was good too, her character was very mysterious. I do believe this is Ben Stiller's finest preference as well. Stiller is a little out of his comfort zone, here he plays a more serious role rather than his comedic roles. The standout performance though is from Gene Hackman. Hackman is just simply fantastic. Anjelica Houston, Owen Wilson, Danny Glover, and Bill Murray also turn in some strong supporting performances as well. This movie has so many great actors, and they all pull there own weight. Everyone is great., I have one minor complaint though. I do wish we got a little more of Bill Murray.\r\n\r\nThis is a Wes Anderson movie, so you know you are going to get an amazing soundtrack. The score mixes Classic Rock/Pop with Mark Mothersbaugh's quirky score. It just works really well. This movie is not your average silly comedy. The movie can be extremely funny at times, but it can also get very serious at times. The Royal Tenenbaums is a very intelligent black comedy that is artfully made.",

            "content": "If anyone has seen a Wes Anderson film, it's an experience you're not likely to forget in a hurry. The characters are just the little bit left of centre, the plot is just a little strange and the script is just a little bit completely insane. And this is his masterpiece.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Tenenbaums documents the lives of three \"highly gifted\" children and their family, extending to their friend and neighbour Eli, to-be stepfather Henry, brother-in-law Raleigh, Raleigh's test subject Dudley, the family butler Pagoda and other assorted \"family\" members.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to know about Wes Anderson's film is that it is, very definitely, Wes Anderson's film. Despite the powerhouse ensemble, Anderson's vision is clearly visible throughout the whole picture, both in his direction and in his script. His peculiar framing techniques, notably the ridiculously wide shots which include only the subject head and shoulders, aren't used to intentionally distract, rather to point out the subtle absurdity of the situation. His fluid style extends to glimpses of cinema verite style but is more controlled than the shaky cam we see more of today. He is able to transition from formalist to realist in a heartbeat and the thought behind every shot is palpable. In other words, this, especially in terms of direction, is a hell of a film. He is also able to add moments of humour or extra emotion to a scene simply by moving the camera a few degrees. The way he keeps the scene emotionlessly static during a few more heartrending scenes is restraint at its finest. And despite the obscure angles and strange framing, this is one of the overriding factors in the film: restraint. Rather than point out every little thing or make sure there's a close-up for the audience's sake, Anderson trusts his audience enough to let them figure it out for themselves. This makes multiple viewings not only a must but a joy as deeper and deeper levels of meaning and humour become apparent each time.\r\n\r\nThe same can be said of the script. After each viewing, new jokes make themselves known, new levels of emotion can be discovered. Anderson's bone-dry deadpan in many situation works to great avail, especially in the humour side of things. Anderson also makes a very important distinction in his film: many of the moments may seem absurd, even surreal, but none of them ever excced the limitations of the possible. Each situation or moment is plausible in light of the characters which makes it all the more hilarious. Anderson's script is, first and foremost, a comedy and he is able to wring humour out of the most banal of situations, whether it's finding a javalina or walking into a closet. Secondly, though, it is a drama, and Wes is able to add in some truly beautiful moments as well as emotionally harrowing. Don't be surprised if you find yourself laughing and crying at the same time, at the same thing. Richie's bathroom sequence is one of the most amazing in the film and the ending is a beautiful example of indie weirdness with true emotion. Anderson's ability to juggle such a variety of complex relationships is truly commendable as well. He never relies on cliche or uses the obvious setup, despite having a huge interlocking network of characters on hand. Chas' fractured relationship with Royal together with his slowly devolving mental state is beautifully executed and pays off brilliantly.\r\n\r\nDespite the director's prowess and the incredible script, a lot of the film relies on the cast. Thankfully, everyone seems to have decided to save their best performances for this film. Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow and Luke Wilson play the three children and are each amazing in their portrayals. Ben Stiller, especially, shows a maturity of performance and depth that you won't find in the likes of Zoolander, as well as finding the humour in every situation. In many ways he is the straight man to a lot of the cast, especially his father. Speaking of whom, Gene Hackman plays Royal, the eccentric/borderline insane patriach of the Tenenbaums. Estranged from his wife and childre, Royal is running out of money and so takes to deception to win his way back into the family. Hackman's performance in the film is one of those that you only get once every ten years. He is at once loveable and detestable, sympathetic and despicable and so much larger than the screen he's on. He brings an air of gravitas to the role which makes him believable and enigmatic. It's a brilliant performance which combines a keen comedic sense with a bombastic disposition and he pulls it off without a single bum note. Gwyneth Paltrow's performance is strangely restrained, lacking the charming smile which has gained her fans worldwide, trading it in for an almost bored quality where everything is unnecessary and a chore to get through. Even though she has a long line of fantastic films, her performance here is so beautifully measured, this may be her best. Luke Wilson's Richie is fantastic as well, though he doesn't have the emotional moment which many of the other roles are afforded. Where Hackman's deception finally gives way to true emotion, Stiller's rage gives way to breaking down and Paltrow's disconnection gives way to feelings, Wilson's zen-like attitude doesn't give way, visibly, to any specific emotion. Despite his \"needle in the hay\" scene having great impact emotionally, his detached sensibility stays intact, outwardly, throughout everything. This makes his performance all the more impressive as the emotion which occassionally leaks out speaks volumes as to what's going on underneath. It's a tribute to his performance that we are able to see this happening at all. The rest of the cast turn in fantastic supporting roles, especially Bill Murray and Anjelica Huston. Owen Wilson also turns a great performance, as does Danny Glover. The ensemble nature of the film means that each performance has its own specific nuance which can be appreciated more and more on repeat viewings. \r\n\r\nAnderson's use of music in the film is fantastically diverse and inventive to a fault. Beginning with the Mutato Muzika Orchestra's version of Hey Jude, the songs become more eclectic as the film goes on, but not for the sake of being diverse in itself. Each song works within the crux of the scene, adding emotion and atmosphere equally. Soundtrack standouts include Needle in the Hay by Elliot Smith and Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard by Paul Simon.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Tenenbaums is beautifully planned, designed and executed and only gets better after repeat viewings. Having Alec Baldwin as a narrator doesn't hurt either.\r\n\r\nDefining Scene:\r\nIt's a toss up between the bathroom scene and the ending montage but I'm going to say the ending for sheer emotional weight.\r\n\r\nQuotes:\r\nHow long have you been a smoker?\r\n22 years...\r\nI think you should quit.\r\n\r\nWhere's that red one gonna go?\r\n\r\nYou've made a cuckold of me my dear. Again.\r\n\r\nHow come he gets to do that?\r\nHe's depressed.\r\nSo am I!\r\nSo are you what?\r\n\r\nEveryone's against me.\r\nIt's your fault man.\r\nI know but dammit, I want this family to love me. How much money you got?\r\nI don't have.\r\nWhat? You're broke? How are we gonna pay for this room?\r\n\r\nHe has the cancer.\r\n\r\nThat's just one man's opinion!\r\n\r\nFour minutes, forty-eight seconds. We're all dead. Burned to a crisp.\r\n\r\nWhat did you say?\r\nHmm? I didn't say anything.\r\nWhen? Right now?\r\n\r\nShe's balling Eli Cash.\r\n\r\nMargot said you told her I was in love with her.\r\nWhy would she tell you that when I specifically asked her not to? \r\nI might ask you the same thing.\r\nYes, and rightfully so.\r\n\r\nAnybody interested in grabbing a couple of burgers and hittin' the cemetery?",

            "content": "3 and a half Stars\n\nDirector Wes Anderson and his longtime writing partner and friend Owen Wilson follow up Bottle Rocket, and Rushmore with this offbeat comedy about a dysfunctional family reunion. The Royal Tenenbaums is very similar to Anderson's previous two movies. The only difference is that he does everything he had accomplished in his two other movies even better in this one. The Royal Tenenbaums is Wes Anderson best movie.\n\nRoyal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) was an extremely successful attorney who had three children with his wife Etheline (Anjelica Huston), she is an archaeologist. Each of the Tenenbaum kids was pretty much a genius: Chas (Ben Stiller) made a killing as a child investor. Richie (Luke Wilson) was a junior tennis champ and a three time U.S. Nationals winner. The adopted Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) was a playwright who won a 50,000 dollar Braverman Grant in the ninth grade. When Royal abruptly left his family however, it was the beginning of two decades of betrayal and epic failure that would scar the Tenenbaums for the rest of there life's. Their past loathing are bitterly held against Royal when he suddenly reappears, claiming to have six weeks to live. He strongly desire's to reconnect with his now broken family. Typically Royal's story is a sham, but his presence and sincere desire for absolution soon have a very strong effect on the Tenenbaums, who are each dealing with thwarted desires and relationships. Among them are Richie's lifelong love for Margot, who's unhappily married to Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray). There is also Etheline's eccentric engagement to Henry Sherman (Danny Glover), he wishes to marry her. One other character is Eli Cash (Owen Wilson), he lived across the street from the Tenenbaum's and became like part of the family. Eli writes very successful western books that get very bad reviews.\n\nThis movie didn't look like much to me. I went in with very low expectations, I was surprised by how good it actually turned out to be. Like I said, this is an offbeat comedy. Anderson specializes in that type of movies. The movie is just brilliant, at the center of this movie we get a character study. The character study is well executed, and excellently thought out. Every single character is developed extremely well, and it's shown in a very clever way. The movie begins on a high note. It starts with an introduction of all of the characters, this was a major highlight of the movie. I also enjoy how the movie is divided into chapters. It gives everything a nice touch, they structure it kind of like a book. Alec Baldwin does the narration, they could not have picked a better actor for this job. Just like in other Anderson movies, there is a very large attention to detail, even though the main attention is being focused on the characters. The costume design and art direction is specific throughout. A good example is the house they all live in. The house could have been a character all on it's own, there are tons of pictures everywhere, and specific character identifying settings. Now for the cast.\n\n Luke Wilson shines brilliantly here by giving one of his best performances. Luke Wilson plays a dark character, and he just plays him to perfection. Gwyneth Paltrow was good too, her character was very mysterious. I do believe this is Ben Stiller's finest preference as well. Stiller is a little out of his comfort zone, here he plays  a more serious role rather than his comedic roles. The standout performance though is from Gene Hackman. Hackman is just simply fantastic. Anjelica Houston, Owen Wilson, Danny Glover, and Bill Murray also turn in some strong supporting performances as well. This movie has so many great actors, and they all pull there own weight. Everyone is great., I have one minor complaint though. I do wish we got a little more of Bill Murray.\n\nThis is a Wes Anderson movie, so you know you are going to get an amazing soundtrack. The score mixes Classic Rock/Pop with Mark Mothersbaugh's quirky score. It just works really well. This movie is not your average silly comedy. The movie can be extremely funny at times, but it can also get very serious at times. The Royal Tenenbaums is a very intelligent black comedy that is artfully made.",

            "content": "I guess I'm in the minority when I say I don't like this one. I don't quite get the draw. The story seems more like a loosely connected series of events, with no central arc to motivate them. Well, I guess you might call it an arc, but it's a very weak one.\n\nSo, if the drama side doesn't work, it must be the comedy that brings all the love, right? But I didn't see a whole lot of that either. Yes there were some great laugh-out-loud moments, but very few and far between (I'd say maybe 4-5 in the whole movie) and the characters were far too serious for me to lighten up about it anyway.\n\nI found almost all the characters to be unlikeable. Danny Glover's was the closest to being likeable. Perhaps because there are too many characters and not enough time to truly explore them so as to make them endearing.\n\nThe story progression seems to be very stop-and-go. And it gets overly dark.\n\nAs one of his earlier works, I found the camera direction to be slightly below average as well.\n\nAnd the music is a very mixed bag.\n\nI've seen this movie 3 times in my life, and I still don't get why it's so loved. I'll try again in a few years. Also noteworthy, The Life Aquatic is my favourite comedy movie of all time, while THAT movie is universally panned. Sure it has it's flaws, too, but still... Weird.",
