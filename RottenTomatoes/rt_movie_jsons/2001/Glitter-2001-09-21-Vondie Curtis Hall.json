Additionally besides Mariah the acting is not bad at all it actually has a pretty decent cast and it is a good cult classic or a good movie to watch if you if you think the movie is going to be bad but its ok/ or mid",

They probably should've delayed the release when 9/11 happened as audiences would surely have seen it as tone deaf, though it would only have helped a little bit. The acting was honestly fine with Beesley doing his level best to channel Marky Mark and Howard is always good. Mariah wasn't exceptionally bad, though it was clear she wouldn't go on to a career like J-Lo's. The soundtrack was fine, particularly if you're a fan of the genre (I am not). The thing I did hate was that an extremely successful singer wanted so badly to make this movie in the first place as it gave me the impression that she wished she'd endured greater hardship in launching her career so that she could be more proud of it when in reality her dad was rich and she married the head of her record label. They had a scene of a singing prostitute, heavily implying it was her mom, but then ended the movie with a bizarrely saccharine reuniting that took away my suspension of disbelief. There are several movies from 2001 that were worse than this, though - it didn't deserve all the hate it got.",

A nobody becomes famous, all of the stuff that comes with fame, and the person who found her dies, a big song at the end...  I was pleasantly surprised with Mariah's acting. I love her speaking voice, very sultry. Her opposite's, \"Dice\" (stupidest name ever) had the worst accent ever. It was as if he was from an Italian mob. I did not understand his character, bad boy with a big heart? I had no attachment to him, whatsoever. Eric Benet would had been a better lead. The camera loved Eric, for the little bits he was there. The beginning of the movie for some reason reminded me of a bad Michael Jackson video, you know, the overdone ones that are obviously developing a victimized mentality for the main person. For the record, Mariah never acted like a victim in the film. I like the use of a few songs that were not her's. I wasn't crazy about the songs from the movie. The use of Lead the Way was not as emotionally intense as it could had been. Whoever wrote the script lost use of that song. It could had been sung by her to her man, drawing us into their relationship more possibly. The two ladies who played the backup dancers were very charming and funny. The three ladies together played well off each other. I know this is supposed to be a \"bad\" movie, but I couldn't quit watching it. Congrats to Mariah on her acting and really holding her own. ",

Occasionally, I see a chunk of cinematic debris that strikes so many wrong chords that I can't figure out how the project was greenlighted in the first place. This is one of those incidents. Glitter lacks anything resembling a sparkle, and, as a movie star, Mariah Carey is the equivalent of a black hole.",

Seriously?). The acting wasn't bad, and while I wish a better job was done with the music, I really have seen worse. I honestly think it would have did better as a television film rather than one to hit theatres. Between 9/11, and the fact that too many people were ragging on Mariah Carey at the time, it really didn't have any hope in the box office. But honestly, in my opinion, not a bad movie.

However formulaic it might have been, the critics were unnecessarily harsh as the movie didn't warrant such low ratings!  I have watched movies in my lifetime that possessed minimal redeeming qualities and/or were painful to sit through, and _Glitter_  did not fall in this category as far I'm concerned...  Is this an Academy award-winning film?  No, but it certainly didn't deserve to be classified as one of the worst movies ever...   I don't think the title of movie was a compelling one; however, the vocal prowess of Mariah Carey is undeniable as she showcased her musical talent quite effectively, especially during Billiie's sold-out concert performance!   I just loved the opening duet between Biillie and her mother and remember being extremely disappointed that it wasn't part of the purchased soundtrack...  I thought that Mariah emoted a longing for her mother and desire to reconnect with her quite convincingly... In fact, this element of the storyline really resonated with me so deeply that tears were streaming down my face during the final scene of the movie!     If you approach the movie with an open and receptive mindset, you might find be able to appreciate the semi-autobiographical nature of the script, Mariah's extraordinarily magical voice and the 80s club-themed music inserted throughout the film, which was just as entertaining as the first time I saw this movie!",

            "content": "If I can sit down to watch a musical and just laugh (unintentionally), I think Glitter will be it.\n\nThe story of a gifted young singer, Billie Frank (Mariah Carey), who overcomes a turbulent childhood and struggles to find her true identity and voice. During her childhood, Billie is abandoned by her drug-addicted mother and is remanded to an orphanage. Years later, Billie is discovered by charismatic, irresistible \"bad boy\" DJ Julian Dice (Max Beesley) who hears her demo and, floored by her talent, gets her a record deal. She soon falls for him and he becomes her partner, producer and lover. With Dice, she begins an exciting but often volatile and precarious journey as she struggles through her personal and professional life, riding the roller coaster to superstardom. However, conflicts with Dice hold her back and she ultimately must begin to escape his influence and find her own style.\n\nIt is so rare that a movie like Glitter fails on every level-- from the acting, to the writing, to the directing, to.... well, you name it. Everything in Glitter is so amateur that makes me think that this should went straight to VH1, MTV, or maybe Lifetime-- expect I think that those channels have better acting, writing, and direction than Glitter. Not only was the movie amateur, it is also cliched. Watching it was thinking \"WOW, I have seen this before but in better movies.\"\n\nThe romance between Carey and Beesley is so unbelievable that I didn't see them as a couple. Not only is it unbelievable but it is very implausible. I really didn't care nor buy their romance as the movie went on.\n\nThe acting in Glitter is so bad that it makes the acting in Showgirls look good by comparison. However, Showgirls is so bad it's good. However, Glitter on the other hand is not. But, I will say that to Glitter's credit, you can not watch the film by yourself. However, it does not mean that it's so bad it's good.\n\nThe best thing about this film called Glitter is obviously when Carey is singing. Everyone is or was dumping on the soundtrack but it wasn't that bad to be honest. However, it was not a perfect or \"oh my god, I have to buy this soundtrack and put it on my iTunes.\" When Carey sings, it is amazing to hear. And the music is decent to hear too.\n\nGlitter is so bad that Carey herself had a meltdown. She apparently blamed the 9/11 attacks when the movie came out. Truth be told, the film failed critically and financially, having a 7% on Rotten Tomatoes and earning back about 4 million over its 22 million (I think). Come on, lets be honest here, we all know the truth. The truth is that Glitter sucks on every level-- with the exception of the music and Carey singing. I understand that it wasn't Mariah's fault that the movie failed. However, I think that she should stick to singing or maybe sticking to supporting roles like her role in the movie Precious (which is a better movie or maybe a better step for Ms. Carey).\n\nIf you want to watch a musical and be entertain, Glitter isn't it. However, if you want to laugh and have a drinking game then you knock yourself out (what I meant about that is you should watch it if you are drunk. Other than that, you should skip this dud and watch some Mariah Carey music videos instead. Oh, did I forget to mention that this film is set in the 80s for no reason. Wow, filmmakers, you really tried it.",

            "content": "This is the 11th film I reviewed and the first to literally give me a headache. A lot of the critics who have reviewed this film use the word Clich\u00e9 a lot and understandably so. \"Glitter\" is not only formulaic, but also has horrible acting and  dreadful writing. So.. let's dive into this worthless excuse for a film. I think it's necessary to take your headache medicine first before you go on reading this review. \n\nThe story in \"Glitter\" is very simple. A singer named Billie Frank (Mariah Carey) is trying to make it in the music industry with the help of her dumb ass boyfriend named Julian Dice (Max Beesley) and some support from her equally annoying friends. And.... that's it. Billie faces no real obstacles or challenges to get to her goal. All she does is get into these pointless arguments with her producer and boyfriend Dice. Also I need to mention Julian Dice is probably one of the most annoying and idiotic characters I ever seen. To put it simply, he himself is a clich\u00e9d and stereotypical idiot. He starts out very supportive of Billie, but as soon as she starts getting famous (what a shock) he starts to get really jealous. This is of course following that stereotypical story formula of the boyfriend not being really famous and somehow his girlfriend gets all the attention. If that weren't enough, Billie and Dice get into these pointless arguments that I really didn't care about. Simply because the both of them were acting more like children than adults. I won't go too much into Billie's friends Roxanne and Louise because they have no real point in the film besides being really lame comic relief. \n\nOf course, the acting in this film is down right terrible, but sometimes has unintentional comedy. I mean whenever Mariah Carey tries to \"act\" serious, I started laughing. I laughed because I knew she wasn't really taking this role seriously. She was mainly playing herself and it clearly shows. Again, Max Beesley's character was horrible in every sense of the word.  He's poorly acted and frankly whenever he was on screen I wanted to punch him in the face. I also found strange Terrence Howard was in this film, I mean I am not sure how great an actor he really is but surely he must be better than this. \n\nEven though this film was nominated for 6 Razzie Awards, it only won one. Of course, Mariah Carey won Worst Actress. I do think the award  is well deserved, but I really would've liked Max Beesley to have won Worst Supporting Actor. Not only was his character annoying and stupid to no end, but his acting was particularly bad here. I might even say this movie should've won Worst Picture, then again I haven't seen \"Freddy Got Fingered\". \n\nTo finally end this review, there is only one word to describe this film. It's the same word I used when I reviewed Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star... pointless. We all know what this film was, a vehicle for Mariah Carey to become an actress. Obviously, this vehicle ran out of gas very quickly. The film is clich\u00e9d, the acting is truly awful with unintentional comedy, the story has no surprises and there really is on direction or writing talent. Take my Advice, stay away from this picture. After reviewing this movie, I only have one question... why is this movie even called \"Glitter\"?",

            "content": "It's incredibly hard to view 'Glitter' objectively given the facts that it was a huge Box Office bomb and that also the leading lady who was supposed to prove she was not only a singer but a an actor too, despite being mentally ill at its release. Now I'm not saying that this review is completely un-biased, after all, I'd been brought up on a healthy diet of Mariah Carey, but I did rent this movie a few weeks ago (it being not released to cinema) due to pure curiosity.\n\nThe multi-octave song-bird's film vehicle (originally titled 'All That Glitters... a much better name I think) opens with in the early 1960's, in an all-black bar with a woman (Valarie Pettiford) singing a jazz/blues number before introducing her young daughter, Billie Frank (Isobel Gomes), to the semi-interested audience and the two launch into a duet which wows the crowd. Cut to the next few shots where Billie's mother tries to get money from Billie's father, before giving her up to an adoption agency.\n\nFast-foward to the bright and bouncy 1980's where all-grown-up Billie (the aforementioned Carey) is dancing in a club with her two best friends Louise and Roxy (Da Brat and Tia Texada), who are soon offered as back-up singing gig for no-talent, good-looking up-and-comer Sylk. Needing the money, the 3 take the job, and the producer finds Mariah's... er... Billie's voice completely spellbinding - and chooses to use her voice instead of the God-awful voice that the main singer is belting out.\n\nA recording of a song entitled \"All My Life\" is handed to a Club DJ - DJ Dice to be exact (British actor Max Beesley who puts on a 'wigga' accent - sometimes really good, other times really bad) who plays it and instantly falls in love with the vocals. Upon discovering that the vocal used is in fact Billie's he instantly wants to be her producer (of course her beautiful looks have nothing to do with it!). So, makes a deal with her old producer Timothy (Terrence Howard) to take the gorgeous Billie and her back-up singing, loud-mouthed friends and take them under his wing - for the reasonable (!) price of ONLY $100,000! So the Dice & Billie end up becoming good friends and record a song, \"I Didn't Mean To Turn You On\", and it is played for music executives, and before you can change the butt groove in your seat, Billie is signed to a major record label.\n\nOf course, the road to musical superstardom is not an easy one and Billie has several troubles - the video director for her first single \"Loverboy\" wants her to parade around in nothing but a piece of string (Billie minds, Mariah wouldn't) and there's also the little problem of her undeniable attraction to Dice. The two become an item and she even moves into Dice's modern, typically New York apartment. Billie's first single unsurprisingly tops the U.S. chart - for ten weeks, at which point the record company are eager to release her first album which they want full control over - p***ing off both Billie and Dice.\n\nOur star-crossed 80's lovers start fighting as her career begins to blossom. She's invited to all the right parties and invited to guest on all the right talk shows - a dream she's had for many years, but amist all of the amazing goings-on, her two best friends are seeing less and less of her and Dice is becoming a drag - she even has to bail him out of jail before an appearance on a show. The two have a massive fight, leading Billie to move out (and Girl Power-ly slap his face). Her attempts at tracking down her addicted biological mother fail as the adoption agency have lost contact with her. Also during this time, she records a single with pop singer Rafael (Halle Berry's musician hubby Eric Ben\u00e9t). The duet, titled \"Want You\" is another number one for Billie, and her biggest dream is about to come true - she's about to play at Madison Square Garden.\n\nThe day of the concert arrives and Billie returns to Dice's apartment to find him not there. Unfortunately Billie's day won't exactly go as planned - it seems, achieving your dreams sometimes means that you'll lose the ones you love. And with that, I won't go into the final minutes' in detail, but I'll just say that is very emotional.\n\nSo that's the story, but were the performances any good? Well yes and no. Mariah Carey (although despite what you've no doubt heard) is a promising actress. Her acting isn't brilliant (yet) - there are times when you feel she goes overboard (especially in the emotional bits). I've found that her most convincing scenes (and therefore best ones) are where she gets angry. Her stereotypical best friends are good too and add a needed comical element. Beesley as DJ Dice is good, although he sometimes seems very fake. Anyone else worth noticing is probably OK.\n\nThe soundtrack is brilliant. Carey's 9th studio album is a pop/r&b LP with great recordings. From the pumping 80's tracks (Last Night A DJ Saved My Life, Didn't Mean To Turn You On, All My Life) to the gorgeous Mariah-like ballads (Lead The Way, Reflections and especially Never Too Far) plus the Eric duet 'Want You' and the Ja Rule infected 'If We' - it's just as good as her previous efforts.\n\nOverall, 'Glitter' IS a film that the troubled songbird should be proud of. It is a drama, though - and watch that, don't think it'll be laugh-a-minute. It's emotional, passionate and with Carey in the lead - it's one rollercoaster ride you'll like at the time and will leave you wanting more. Recommended definitely... Go Mariah!",
