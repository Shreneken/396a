I also really liked the colors of the monsters and their personalities. My personal favorite was Sully, who not only succeeded at the Monsters University (also a great movie) but also succeeded in changing the social implications at the scream factory. I have never been more proud of two friends like Sully and Mike Wazowski.",

            "content": "My dear readers, it is with a heavy heart that I must express my disdain for the recent move picture known as Monsters, Inc. While I had hoped to enjoy a lighthearted and funny tale of monsters and mayhem, I found myself deeply troubled by the implications of the film's central premise.\nFor those not familiar with the picture, it concerns a corporation that captures and stores monsters within massive pods in order to turn them into consumer products. This may sound like a harmless enough enterprise, but one must consider the broader implications of such a practice.\nIndeed, what happens to these monsters once they are captured? Do they simply exist in captivity until they are processed and sold off to the highest bidder? Or does the company commit other atrocities upon the creatures, either by way of experimentation or outright abuse?\nThese are the troubling questions that the film fails to address, and I fear that children will be exposed to such disturbing notions as they watch this motion picture. Thus, I would implore parents to shield their young ones from the dangers of this motion picture, and to encourage them to find more constructive ways to spend their time.\nI would also ask that the Church take steps to educate families on the importance of viewing wholesome films that are free of questionable or immoral premises. There is a need for greater oversight and accountability in the area of moviemaking, lest we allow ourselves to be lulled into complacency by the seductive allure of entertainment.",

The animation was truly excellent, with colourful and engaging backgrounds, and no stiff movements as far as I could see. I wasn't hugely keen on the song playing over the end credits, but compared to the overall goodness of the film, that is such a minor criticism, and it is fair to say that people have different tastes in music. The script was very, very funny, particularly with the character Roz. The voice talents were fantastic, John Goodman and Billy Crystal were brilliant as Sulley and Mike, Steve Buschemi clearly has a lot of seedy fun as Randall, Jennifer Tilly is wonderfully innocent as Mike's girlfriend, and the late James Coburn is wholly convincing as Waternoose. And I loved the character of Boo, she was so cute, and I loved the ending, people complained it was overly-sentimental but I thought it was so sweet. The story, as is always the case with Pixar films is highly original and charming, and doesn't drag at all. Overall, a wonderful film, truly entertaining and a must-see, and if you are starting to lose faith in Disney and their countless sequels, this is perfect for you. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox.",

The story here is great and the relationship between Sully and Boo, the young human girl, is the heart of the film. Randell, the antagonist, is voiced well by Steve Buscemi and is a threatening presence throughout the film. The very last scene of the movie always leaves me with the warm-fuzzies.

            "content": "My first ever exposure to Monsters, Inc. was when we had gone to McDonald's and I got a Mike Wazowski toy. I was really scared of it, and my sister used to often scare me with it. Little did I know that Mike is supposed to be the comic relief of the movie. Later on I saw the trailer, and eventually the whole movie. And now I can say with a guarantee that Monsters Inc is one of the better Disney movies. Sure there are some things I didn't like (which I will talk about later) but other than those things, this is absolutely perfect.\nOne thing I really like about Pixar is that they always take one thing we like from our lives and then expand it into a full blown story. You play with toys? There's Toy Story. You like fishes and the ocean? There's Finding Nemo. You like cars? There's...well, Cars. So similarly over here we were all afraid of monsters coming into our rooms when we were sleeping alone as kids, and that's what this movie is based on. Unlike the conventional monsters who want to kill us, these monsters are working for a power company who just use children's screams for powering up their world.\nThe story revolves around Sullivan and his best friend Mike Wazowski, who work at Monsters, Inc. Sully is a professional scarer while Mike collects the screams from the children. However, there is one rule that the monsters must abide by - children should not learn about their world otherwise they will no longer be scared and the monster world will run out of energy. Things go down very badly when Mike and Sully find out that Sully accidentally brought a little girl named Boo back to their world. Meanwhile Randall, the second best scarer and Sully's rival, is making a scream extractor which will help him extract the most screams and make him the best employee.\nThe movie is twenty years old and still the world shown here is very dynamic even by today's standards. The third act where Sully, Mike, Boo and Randall are jumping from one door to another was very cool. The animation is also very good, especially the fact that every single hair on Sully's body is distinguishable, and all the pores on Randall's body can be seen. The comic timing is also great, like the part where Randall says, \"Say hello to my scream extractor!\" and Mike immediately says \"Hello.\". And also the part where Sully thinks Boo got crushed so he faints just as the emotional music starts playing.\nNow like I said, there are a couple of things I didn't like in this movie, which is what stopped me from giving it a perfect score. First of all I really liked Randall. He was my favourite character in the whole movie. He looks cool, his superpowers are admirable and he's stronger than he looks. But he still loses to humans. First with Boo, who is literally a child who can't even speak. And then by grown humans who beat him with a broom in the end. It would have been better if he got stuck in the middle of nowhere like he made Sully and Mike do so. And the second thing is the part where they are in Nepal. That was boring to say the least.\nMonsters, Inc. is one of those movies that can be enjoyed by both children and adults. It is very rare for a Disney movie to be that way nowadays, so it can be revisited back even today. Like I said, its animation has aged very well, which is why it is so much fun to watch it without feeling something is off. And it has a sequel too, something it took me too long to learn about. I really liked it compared to most movies Disney has been making nowadays.",

So yeah, I just don't feel like spelling it out, but I am. This is movie is basically perfect in ever way possible. Going off the Toy Story 2 review, this has the comedy down, the great characters, and the emotion. Man does this movie have emotion! However, this movie starts the trend of the ending being the most emotional moment of the movie. Of course, this is one of the best examples of that. If I really had to find something to complain about (just because it's a movie review and you have to talk about something negative), it's that Mike can be a little bit too much of a jerk sometimes, but he's really funny, so he can get away with it. He's definitely less annoying then someone like Mr Potato Head in the first Toy Story, far from it. So yeah, if you haven't seen this one, shame on you! Go to Disney+ and watch it now! It's currently the best Pixar movie I have reviewed so far, and it probably is one of the best ones Pixar has ever made!",

In fact they were the highlight of the the film for me and gave actually the best emotional moments out of the entire film. However the funniest thing in the movie is actually Mike Wasouski. Billy Crystal's performance just give so much energy to the character. However the one problem that I have with the movie is the villain Randal. I just didn't find him that interesting. However even though he's not as interesting to me he does provide some funny moments as well. However with all that being said there is a twist villain that is much better and can be really interesting for the movie. Monsters, Inc was really fun and enjoyable to watch, with fun characters and with a surprisingly engaging story. 9/10",

            "content": "The best computer animated film of them all, and the most adult\nUntil now I couldn't bring myself to believe that computer animation was the equal of either stop motion animation or hand-drawn animation. All computer animated films looked a little (usually more than a little) too sterile, many were animated poorly (\"Antz\", \"Shrek\", \"Final Fantasy\"), and even the single unqualified success (\"Toy Story 2\") provided little evidence that a computer animated film COULD reach the heights other kinds of animation could. \"Toy Story 2\" had flawless character animation, but nothing as inspired as the best in \"Tarzan\" (released the same year, although I could have chosen almost any other Disney cartoon to make my point); effective art direction, but nothing to match \"Fantasia\" or \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\". And I thought that \"Toy Story 2\" was as good as the art was ever going to get.\n\nI was wrong. This is far better. And what's more, there's no sense whatever that the script (an unusually rich and uninhibited script) is bumping up against the limits of what the medium will allow. It's now been proven that computer animation CAN be just as good as any other kind. Whether it will be allowed to be in future is another question, but for now, I'm hopeful. What we have here is computer animation's first ENTIRELY unalloyed artistic delight, with every character gracefully and characteristically animated, every virtual set just right and pleasing to look at, and an eye-tickling mastery of colour, light and shade that I thought would forever elude CGI artists.\n\nIt's not fair to judge anything good as \"Monsters, Inc.\" as though it were a children's movie, but I can't resist comparing it with \"Shrek\" - which emphatically IS a children's movie. \"Monsters, inc.\" is admittedly ABOUT children, in a sort of a way. The inhabitants of Monstropolis rely on children's screams for their energy, and the central story is kicked off when one of the monsters accidentally brings a small child (which he calls \"Boo\") into the city. But we never see things from her point of view. We see things from the point of view of the monsters, who are all adults - and who, like most adults, see children as frightening, almost incomprehensible members of another species. And they ARE. To be sure, Wazowski comes to feel strong affection for Boo, but she never becomes more than a humanoid pet (which is not to demean the relationship). This is a story about adults looking at childhood from the outside.\n\n\"Shrek\", of course, is a children's movie through and through. Its attention span is short, it has an unthinking mean streak, and children will have a whale of a time watching the central characters (the bigger they are, the more fun it is) act childishly and make poo-poo jokes. \"Monsters, Inc.\" has too much genuine wit, characters too rich, a world with too much depth, and a story at once too coherent and too complicated, to be PRIMARILY a film for children. This is not to say children won't like it. Maybe they will. (Who can say?) Here's the bonus: if they DO like it, it will (unlike \"Shrek\") actually have a beneficial effect. It will make them less frightened of the dark.",

Pete Docter took on the role of director, being his first gig as a director for a major production, while Andrew Stanton, John Lasseter & Darla K. Anderson produced.\n\nMonsters Inc. was a very well told story. The narrative didn't just focus on scaring; It had a few sub plots, of friendship and maturing, but Andrew Stanton, Jill Culton, Jeff Pidgeon, Ralph Eggleston & Daniel Gerson balanced every subplot so well, that it flowed just right with the story. The writers stood true to the G rating, and kept everything pretty sane, with a lot of well rounded comedic tone.\n\nJohn Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton & Joe Ranft, designed these extremely detailed & creative looking characters, with their own personalities, sounds, and appearance. Mike is one of main protagonist, who plays the smart guy, while Michael \"Sulley\" Sullivan, who is our other protagonist, is like the Tom Brady of Monsters Incorporated. Mike & Sulley have this tremendous chemistry, you can only really dream to have with a friend/co-worker. For someone who didn't have much to say, that we can really understand, Boo tests Mike & Sulley's friendship to different levels! Her character is so cute and charming, carrying a lot of weight for someone who couldn't sit still during voice recordings. Steve Buscemi does a great job as the voice of Randall, but he isn't the smartest of the villain bunch. If you really watch what he does, he's pretty oblivious, and his outcome is pretty pathetic, but comedic gold on our end.\n\nNeedless to say, the animations were beautiful, with great detail, and textures. The score and music by Randy Newman was fantastic. It was so much fun, that it won an Academy Award for Best Music, Original Song.\n\nOverall, Monsters Inc. belongs at the top of the pack, because of all the heart, and wit put into this film.",

(2001) is 92 minutes of laughter from a movie about monsters and scares. Docter's direction is phenomenal as he lets you into his imaginative world of monsters frightening children to harvest their fear screams for renewable energy. It's a great premise and Docter's writing alongside Andrew Stanton is super funny, completely original, and really engaging. You will laugh and maybe even tear up by the end. Jim Stewart and Robert Grahamjones' editing is really slick with a fast paced set of cuts to tear through the story. Monsters, Inc. is easily in Pixar's top 5 films out of their dozens of animated pictures.\n\nHarley Jessup and Bob Pauley's production design is really cute with an industrial factory setting set next to a quaint monster city that all feel cozy and lived in. Tia W. Kratter and Dominique Louis' art direction is so pretty with all the fuzzy purples, blues, and pinks with a pastel tone to everything. Jon Childress Farmer's set decoration is comfy, cute, and full of Pixar Easter eggs and neat jazz themes in many rooms. Randy Newman's score is gentle jazz and heartwarming classical passages with the other composer Andrew Page. I really love Newman's jazz stuff for Monsters, Inc.\n\nYou are really watching Monsters, Inc. for the spectacular, star-studded vocal talents, who all play their part with a wonderful warmth and apt skillfulness. John Goodman delivers one of cinema's most heartwarming performances with just his nice tender voice as James P. Sullivan. His massive blue and purple dotted fuzzy monster Sulley is so sweet and affectionate. Goodman makes his lovable monster into a fatherly figure for the little girl Boo, voiced by an adorable Mary Gibbs, endearing himself to a generation.\n\nLikewise, Billy Crystal is a riot as the flippant and outrageous green ball goblin guy named Michael Wazowski. Mike Wazowski is witty with Crystal's iconic sense of humor, while also being endearing for his devotion to his cute medusa girlfriend Celia Mae, voiced by the sweet sounding Jennifer Tilly. Steve Buscemi joins his The Big Lebowski co-star Goodman as Buscemi voices the chameleon villain Randall Boggs. His selfish goals for adoration and greed make the vicious Randall a fearsome antagonist. You never know when he'll appear.\n\nJames Coburn brings his deep gravelly toned voice as the imposing crab boss of Monsters, Inc. named Henry J. Waternoose III. Bob Peterson does such a funny voice for the perpetually unimpressed clerk Roz. John Ratzenberger is too funny as the cheerful Yeti. Frank Oz cameos as Randall's little red minion Fungus with his wonderful Fozzy Bear type voice. Bonnie Hunt also has a cute cameo as the scare instructor Flint.\n\nIn all, Monsters, Inc. works wonders and holds up both in its groundbreakingly detailed computer animation, unique concept, hilarious script, moody music, and killer voice cast.",

Memorable characters, funny smart dialogue and they have a big heart. They succeeded in creating a new world here. An interesting one. I've always liked Monsters and horror. So its interesting to see all these monster designs. It's a great concept for a story. Harvesting screams from scared children to produce clean energy for the Monster world. Lots of quirky stuff. Small things like Mike the green ball cyclops putting in his contact lens. There are a fair number of subtle adult jokes to enjoy. The Villains are great. Very memorable and menacing. They go together well. Sully is such a loveable character with a big heart. Mike is more pragmatic but also has a good heart really. I believe them as friends working together. Its actually fairly quotable too. \"There is nothing more toxic, more dangerous then a Human child. A single touch could kill you!\" I like to use that one when little kids sneeze or cough on me. Little biohazards that they are. Lol. The voice acting here is fun. \"2319! We have a 2319!\" \nThe CDA hysteria is just hilarious.

            "content": "Pixar followed up the improbably fantastic Toy Story 2 (1999) with this huge hit which was one of many 2001 animated films targeted towards children that dominated the box office that year. It was not quite enough to win Best Animated Feature at the Academy Awards as it lost the award to Shrek (2001) which was considered so clever and witty at the time. I would argue that this film has held up better than that one in part due to the fact that it's sequel Monsters University (2013) was much better than the better forgotten sequels to Shrek. Adults and children will find something to appreciate in this film.\n\nIn the city of Monstropolis the screams of children are used as a power source and Monsters Inc. is the largest business that deals in extracting the screams. They send monsters into children's rooms at night through a complicated system involving doors stored in the factory and James \"Sully\" Sullivan, John Goodman, is the most successful scarer of all time. He is assisted by the smart but diminutive in stature Mike Wazowski, Billy Crystal, who balances his commitment to his girlfriend Celia Mae, Jennifer Tilly, with his responsibilities at work. Their lives are thrown into disarray when a little girl, Boo, Mary Gibbs, escapes from her door and the two are forced to become father figures to her while hiding her from their employer Henry J. Waternoose III, James Coburn, who has sinister intentions. When their actions are discovered they are banished but by working together they are able to uncover a conspiracy hidden by their employers. They face off with nemesis Randall Boggs, Steve Buscemi, who seeks to prevent them from keeping Boo alive so that she can safely return home.\n\nThe film's plot is relatively simple when you get beyond the complications of the process used to extract screams from the children and so that leaves the film open to explore it's characters. The first thirty minutes of the film are brilliant as we set up the close friendship between Wazowski and Sullivan and the differences between them as individuals perfectly. One is the masculine ideal as he is physically capable to the point of being scary and the other is short, has often been overlooked in favor of his friend but has a great deal of chutzpah. The spirited voice performances of Goodman and Crystal, both well cast, inform us of the characters personalities immediately as Goodman is massive but underneath his physical appearance he is a real softie while Crystal's typical fast talking style is put to good use. We like both of these monsters and feel that we know their bond intimately so it makes the heavy on plot, light on character development remainder of the film acceptable.\n\nThe animation style has not aged particularly well but it still has it's charms as Mae's hair looks as kinetic as it did in 2001. This should not bother children as I have found they are more interested in characters and an emotionally fulfilling arc than big budget spectacles.",

You, of course, also have Boo (Mary Gibbs) who is simply adorable.\n\nEverything else from the plot to the animation is fantastic, too - I have no faults with this film.

Very good and quotable dialogue. Good and steady editing. Very good music that fits really nicely with the film. Very good story and premise but with monsters. Very good comedy mainly from Mike Wazowski voiced by Billy Crystal. The film can also be quiet emotional toward the end. The film is also really enjoyable and fun to watch.

This movie is about two monsters, Sully, the best scarer out there, and Mike, his best friend and scare technician. In order to power their cities, the monsters have to go into the human world and scare children to collect scream energy, their only source of power. And when a child, whom monsters think are toxic, from the human world enters into the monster world and causes all sorts of mischief. I recommend you watch this film if you want an adventure full of drama and comedy.\n\n       With John Goodman, the voice of Sully, you know you're getting quality voice acting and just quality acting in general. His other roles are proof of this such as his role in 10 Cloverfield Lane(2016) and Argo(2012). He has been nominated for five golden globes and won one as well, nine primetime emmys and won one of those as well, and a myriad of other nominations and awards for his acting. His character, Sully, is the best scarer in the business and is really scary according to their society's norms, but is still a big old softie.\n\n       As well as having Steve Buscemi, Randall(the main villain) you know that you're gonna get a lot of laughs with his unique voice and methods of acting. He has acted in great films such as Fargo(1996) and Reservoir dogs(1992). Buscemi has been a nominee for a golden globe three times and won one, and nominated for six primetime emmys and won one as well, and a large amount of other nominations and awards for his acting. His character Randall is the second best scarer and is tired of feeling second best and uses his power and vindictive nature to stir up trouble.\n\n       With such a great cast of actors and crew members, as well as animation that was incredibly advanced for its time, \u00e2The Pixar crew has lovingly refashioned the R-rated fraternity comedy into a G-rated adventure that kindergarteners, frat brothers, and tired parents can all enjoy equally and without reservation\u00e2?(Chen). This movie can be enjoyed by all without any reparations for what happens.\n\nCitations\nChen, Sandie Angulo. \u00e2Monsters University - Movie Review.\u00e2?

Of course me and my friends watched it and quoted from it, it's just so much fun. I have no idea what my favourite character in the film is. I was actually thinking about the two major characters Sulley and Mike but to me I like Sulley. He's the one who found the child named Boo in the monster world and be friends with her. Mike Wazowski is funny too. Those two are voiced by John Goodman and Billy Crystal. I remember the video game of it called Monsters, Inc. Scare Island and I absolutely loved it. I actually do love the soundtrack of it as well and it has great graphics. Just to clarify, I think the game is actually a prequel game to Monsters, Inc. and if you think Monsters University is a prequel to Monsters, Inc., think again. After the stories of Monsters University, Mike and Sulley try to get a job at Monsters, Inc. by going to Scare Island in order to train to become top scarers to scare children. And after that happened, the actual movie happened. In the movie the two monsters Sulley and Mike are top scarers in the Monsters, Inc. factory and if a human is in the monster world they can get toxic on them which includes clothes and touch. I think the film is re-released in 3-D in 2012 after The Lion King in 2011. I think Beauty and the Beast did that too. I think they did that just so they can get the general audience loving it again. What can I say about the animation? Well, technically I don't. Because everything here is just absolutely spectacular. I know I said that in all animated films I reviewed but this one is so colourful. It has some creative colourful characters and when I say creative, I mean, the colours on the monsters are beautifully made and unbelievably crafted. There's also bloopers in the end credits much like A Bugs Life and Toy Story 2. I even liked the blooper which Mike and Sulley did is \"Put that thing back where it came from or so help me.\" One in the film and two in the end credits.",

Movies like Monsters, Inc prove that Pixar is undoubtedly and deservedly the true champion of animation going forward. This movie is amazing, it looks great, the acting is superb and the story is unique. Billy Crystal IS Mike Wazowski, an ocular monster who makes up for his lack of size or fear inducing anything by being alongside the greatest scarer Monster City has ever seen, Sully. This dynamic duo are so great together and the movie flows beautifully through them. The subtext of an energy crisis because children are not as frightened of monsters as much as they used to be and the fact that energy is required by the ever increasing population is a great way to showcase this issue in a unique and fun loving way. This movie also has the funniest and possibly most gruesome fake death scene in movie history with the garbage compactor sequence where Sully believes Boo is being crushed and dismembered and ends with the heartbreaking look on Sully's face as he holds in his arms what he believes to be Boo's remains in garbage cube form. This is a movie no collection is complete without and even the prequel, Monsters University, adds to the narrative of these two characters and a couple others and must be enjoyed alongside this soon to be classic.",

When somethings we can't stand to see when our scares are only for work when other scares we don't take personally. \n\nWhen what we don't normally get to see from a closer scope we see why we are seen as monsters when what others see in their innocent eyes is what gives us guilt when it's not real to us but real to them that we see it's wrong. When we see an alternative when outdated practices we need to see more laughs when it's much more fulfilling. When what we see we don't always miss when it's unmeaningful work, to come everyday to something's we can see when it's much more fulfilling.\n\nWhen what we can't see let out, we see no need for a paper trail, when we don't see recording such events is important.",

            "content": "This is a good movie if you like movies about the city of Monstropolis in the monster world is powered by energy from the screams of human children. At the Monsters, Inc. factory, skilled monsters employed as \"scarers\" venture into the human world to scare children and harvest their screams, through doors that activate portals to the children's bedroom closets. It is considered dangerous work, as human children are believed to be \"toxic\". Energy production is falling because children are becoming less easily scared, and company chairman, Henry J. Waternoose, is determined to find a solution. James P. \"Sulley\" Sullivan is the organization's top scarer, but his chief rival Randall Boggs is close behind.\n\nOne day, Sulley discovers that Randall has left a door activated on the scare floor and a small girl has entered the factory. After several failed attempts to put her back, Sulley conceals her and takes her out of the factory. He interrupts his best friend Mike Wazowski's date with his girlfriend, Celia, at a sushi restaurant, and chaos erupts when the child is discovered. Sulley and Mike manage to escape with the child before the Child Detection Agency (CDA) quarantines the restaurant. They soon discover that she is not really toxic after all; Sulley grows attached to her and calls her \"Boo,\" while Mike is just anxious to be rid of her.\n\nWhen they smuggle her back into the factory disguised as a baby monster in an attempt to send her home, Randall discovers her and tries to kidnap her, but he mistakenly kidnaps Mike instead. He straps Mike to a large machine called \"The Scream Extractor,\" which he intends to use to revolutionize the scaring industry and solve the monster world's energy problems by forcefully extracting screams from kidnapped human children. Before Randall can use the machine on Mike, Sulley intervenes and reports Randall to Waternoose. Waternoose, secretly in league with Randall, instead exiles Mike and Sulley to the Himalayas. The two are taken in by a Yeti, who tells them about a nearby village which Sulley realizes he can use to return to the factory. Sulley prepares to leave, but Mike refuses to go with him. Meanwhile, Randall is preparing to use the Scream Extractor on Boo, but Sulley arrives and saves her. Randall and Sulley fight, and after Mike returns and the two reconcile, they overpower Randall, take Boo, and flee.\n\nRandall pursues them to the door vault, and a wild chase ensues among the millions of doors as they move in and out of the storage vault on rails to the factory floor. Boo's laughter causes all the doors to activate, allowing the monsters to pass in and out of the human world. Randall attempts to kill Sulley, but Boo overcomes her fear and attacks him. Sulley and Mike trap Randall in the human world, where two residents at a trailer park mistake him for an alligator and beat him with a shovel. Sulley and Mike then trick Waternoose into revealing his plot with Randall, while Mike secretly records the entire conversation for the CDA to view. The CDA arrests Waternoose, while Sulley and Mike say goodbye to Boo and return her home before her door is shredded to prevent any more contact with her.\n\nWith the factory temporarily shut down, Sulley is named the new CEO of Monsters, Inc. Under his leadership, the energy crisis is solved by harvesting children's laughter instead of screams, as laughter has been found to be much more potent. Mike takes Sulley aside, revealing he has rebuilt Boo's door and only needs one final piece, which Sulley took as a memento. Sulley enters and joyfully reunites with Boo. Wonderful successor to the previous Monsters Elementary in 1902.",

            "content": "Monsters Inc (2001) - Is a very imaginative movie with a concept that I would say is brilliant. This would be the first film to be helmed by Pete Doctor and it definitely shows. I remembered loving this movie as a kid and admittedly even deep down in my heart I still love the movie as an adult.\nThe Concept is possibly one of the best if not the best idea Pixar has ever came up with. The world building is incredible as it takes the idea of monsters scaring children and makes an entire world around it. It's amazing the way they got creative with establishing the way Monsters Incorporated functions and the creative reason why monsters need to scare children. The actual narrative itself does play on with the movies ideas while adding some laugh out loud humor and some surprising deep messages about the acceptance of fatherhood and economic decline. I could go on and on about the creativity of this movie but overall it's some of Pixar's best world building. \nThe Characters are casted perfectly and all of them are just irresistible in all the right ways. Sully is loveable and really sympathetic when it comes to protecting Boo and making sure she's safe. Mike is comedic powerhouse and gets a lot of big laughs Thanks to Billy Cyrstal's voice work. His relationship with Sully is really genuine and can be put to the test in certain parts of the movie. Boo might be a little distracting sometimes, but she really is cute and she does serve a more important purpose in the movie later on. Randall, being one of the antagonists really does go all out with his sinisterness and I can tell that Steve Buscemi had a blast voicing the character. Mr Waternoose is probably the most tragic character I've ever come across. I would go into why but it would give away spoilers. I will say that he's one of those characters that meant well even if he was doing the wrong thing and I felt so sorry for him in the end. The rest of the characters can have their moments of standing out (Especially Roz) and they contribute as much as they can when they interact with the main characters.\nThe Animation really brings all the creativity to life and it sucks us into a whole new world for us to explore. One thing that was really cool is how in the beginning they start with a very upbeat 2D sequence. It's a very creative way to open the movie and the animation plays along perfectly with the music. The environments are just amazing to look at and they show off every creative aspect from the quiet streets of Monstropolis, to the epic size and scale of Monster incorporated's door vault. The design of the monsters are very creative and some of the little details like sully's fur are very impressive.\nThe Music was for the fourth time by Randy Newman. The Upbeat Jazz music really gives the movie an identity and it adds on to the movies style in a lot of scenes. A lot of the other music uses the soft violin melodies to let the heartfelt scenes play out. The movie's theme works greatly when played with the 2D animated opening and it really is irresistible to listen to. Even the song at the end credits \"If I didn't have you\" is a great representation of the relationship between Mike and Sully.\nSometimes I do tend to forgot how much I used to love this movie. Although some of Pixar's other films might have left slightly bigger impacts I still have a special place in my heart for this movie. It has a very imaginative concept, lovable characters, Amazing animation and a very upbeat music score. It was one of the first Pixar movies i've ever scene and it introduced me to one of the best animation studios in the business. (A)",

The film boasts a simple yet clever concept as monsters are depicted as regular people who scare children as part of their job since it powers electricity in their world. The characters are, as one would come to expect from a Pixar film,memorable with Billy Crystal and John Goodman being perfect for the vocal roles of Mike and Sulley, respectively. Considering that this is the most memorable film for both Goodman and Crystal to date, that's saying a lot. Steve Buscemi also seems to be having fun voicing Randall, who's oddly entertaining in a way. Note that I can't, at the moment, favourably compare him to a role in one of the movies that the Coen brothers directed. Maybe next time, Fargo. The film also is pretty charming and sweet. There's also this sequence set in a door vault and you can tell the animators worked really hard on it so that we can be amazed by it. An irresistible animation classic regardless of your age.",

            "content": "This is probably my favorite Pixar movie, and animated movie for that matter, other than possibly Up. It is imaginative, creative, funny, entertaining, and fun. I'll start with the concept. It's probably Pixar's most clever concept to date, other than Inside Out. The idea that the monsters in your closets and under your beds are not forces of evil, but rather just average everyday 9-5 office workers who scare to collect the energy of human screams is incredibly innovative and creative. Too many films stop there, though -- they have a cool concept, but the movie itself doesn't deliver. Monsters, Inc. more than delivers on its concept though. Enter Mike and Sulley, two buddies who work at Monsters, Inc. The chemistry between them is great, Mike is hilarious, and every moment with the two of them onscreen is filled to the brim with energy. \nThen the plot begins, which, given the concept, was probably the best plot they could possibly think of: a kid escapes out into the monster world. Sulley finds her, brings her home, and the next day he and Mike try to put her back in her door. Sulley begins to develop a relationship though, which is handled very nicely -- it takes time to develop, and feels genuine. \nBy the end of the movie, my favorite sequence, they find themselves riding one of the many millions of doors through a giant warehouse in the factory. This is where the concept is extended to its creative extreme; it starts with the simple idea that maybe monsters scare you as part of their job, and by the end, we're allowed the visual of the millions of different doors stored in the factory. The chase scene at the end is very fun and entertaining, but what is best about it is the concept their dealing with, enhancing its creative energy. There is a chase scene after the door scene that is very cleverly organized as well, that I like just a much -- most of the fun of that scene is derived from the way everything comes together.\nThen of course there's the touching ending between Sulley and Boo. Most Pixar movies lay their emotional, poignant themes and sequences on pretty heavily (Toy Story 2 & 3, Finding Nemo, Up, Inside Out, to name a few), but in this one, it's kind of subtle, and I like that. They give you just enough to emotionally connect with characters, and what I love most about it is how genuine it feels -- they've taken time to establish these characters and their relationships, so it doesn't feel forced. Their relationship is both a neat idea on paper, and heartwarming to watch. \nOn top of my main points for loving this movie, this is probably Pixar's funniest movie. I know there's people who can't stand Mike, but I find myself laughing at everything that comes out of his mouth. God knows Pixar has had comical relief characters that become more annoying than funny -- believe me, I've seen the Cars movies. But then there are characters like Mike and Dory, who don't overdo it at least for me, and end up becoming one of the most charming aspects of the film. The movie isn't too long, which is very admirable in a kid's movie, and builds tension perfectly to climax. I've seen this movie many, many, times, and it is always enjoyable and entertaining. This is one of my top 20 favorite films of all time, not because it does anything huge, but merely because of its charm, style, fun, creativity, and entertainment. This is one of the most underrated Pixar movies, usually considered to be the worst of the \"good ones\" (meaning not A Bug's Life, Cars, Cars 2, Brave, Monsters University, and the Good Dinosaur), which is a shame because it truly is a wonderful film.",

John Goodman and Billy Crystal carry most of the heavy-lifting as Mike and Sulley, blue collar creatures with an easy, free-flowing rapport, but three-year-old Mary Gibbs threatens to steal the scene every time she gets the chance with her adorable almost-words and penetrating good cheer. Exceedingly well-balanced, with the kind of imagination that keeps mouths gaping and so much heart, even the boogeyman might have to fight back a tear or two.

Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) and roommate James P. Sullivan (John Goodman) work together everyday at Monsters, Inc.; the world's largest power company. When Mike makes reservations to go on a date with girlfriend, Celia (Jennifer Tilly), Sully goes to fill out Mike's paperwork and stumbles across a door. Naturally he opens it to see if there are any monsters in there before he sends it back, but he finds out that no one is in there. When he leaves he discovers a human child; the first human child that Monstropolis has ever seen. Humans are toxic to monsters, so this is not to be taken lightly. The rest of the movie is full of humor, seriousness, and a whole lot of screaming. Monsters, Inc. presents itself well with humorous lines, and a cast that really put the movie together. On the other hand, there are a lot of characters in the movie that have just one or two lines, while the rest of the movie is based on the same four characters. The movie also has a lot of scenes that seem to last forever, with no real direction. Overall, I give this movie five out of five stars. Bring the kids, grab your candy and get ready for a lot of laughs.",

I'm sure you know what the best part of the film is, the relationship between Sully and Boo watching it develop is incredibly touching and tear-jerking but there is a lot of comedy in and around it too. Pixar cater for adults as well as kids beautifully like they always do.",

In fact, I'm far from alone in putting this film right up with the previous Toy Story ventures, as I believe it packs the same level of brilliant charm, exciting moments and great characters - as well as even more beautiful visuals - to build a properly enjoyable film for the whole family.\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: It never delves particularly deep into it's ideas, but keeping in mind what it's trying to be, it really does excel.\nVERDICT: Much like the previous Toy Stories, 'Monsters Inc' succeeds exactly where it wants to - building charming emotions, swooping joys, and the occasional serious idea alongside.",

Crystal portrays Mike Wazowski hilariously and Goodman does some good enough seriousness (as well as some humor) with Sully. This was a good childhood classic of mine as well. The doors leading into the human world electronically I think is an interesting idea. The scene near the end with every single door in one place was a scene I really liked when I was younger.

But what makes this movie so great is debatable between the plot, the development of the characters, and the soundtrack.\n\nMonsters Inc. gave a plot to its audience that helped children sleep soundly at night. The plot of Monsters Inc. shows two friends who are presented with a problem that not only gives them a new friend but tests their own friendship. The movie allows a new point of veiw and shows us that a monster world isn't much different than our own.\n\nDisney has always been able to make relatable characters, but with Sully and Mike, the two leading roles of Monsters Inc., even the adults could relate. Sully and Mike were the two best friends and co-workers, figuring out their daily problems one step at a time. Sully the alpha of the pair, fluffy and warm hearted, and Mike the managing under dog who always forgets to turn in his paper work. These two become loved for bravery and heroism.\n\nI believe that one of the most important thing to any film is its soundtrack, with the right music a film can jerk tears. From the jazzy theme song that brings smiles to people everywhere when heard to the motivational music playing as Sully flys through doors carrying Boo. The theme song to Monsters Inc. is recognized as a happy tune and that really reflects the movie itself.",

The characters were loveable and memorable; my favourite has got to be Sulley. Monsters, Inc is about the monster world which is seperate from the human world and monster world of Monstropolis is powered by screams of children. At the Monsters, Inc factory, scarers venture into children's bedrooms and scare them in order to collect their screams. This is considered to be a dangerous task as children are considered to be toxic. The factory is going under as children are becoming harder to scare. The chairman Henry J Waternoose (James Coburn) relies on his top Scarer, James P Sullivan aka Sulley (John Goodman) who lives with his assistant and fellow worker Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal). One day when Sulley is working late, one of the doors is left often and a child ventures into the factory. Sulley learns that the child isn't toxic and he quickly grows attached to her, naming the girl Boo. Mike and Sulley embark on a mission to get Boo home safely.\r\n\r\nMonsters, Inc is a good natured film with fun and imaginative characters. Monsters Inc I'm sorry to say isn't as good as Shrek, but like Shrek it's got heart and some valuable lessons. I think I last saw Monsters, Inc when I was nine or ten, when it first came out so it was refreshing watching it after so many years, this time as an adult. Films like Monster's, Inc always bring out the inner kid in me. Monster's Inc is also humorous, even for adults. I found, Roz (voiced by Bob Peterson), the slug like monster was hilarious! I love films like these, they always make me feel like a kid again. Sulley is just adorable, on of my favourite animated characters of all time and the ending made me want to blub. Monsters, Inc is unforgettable. Definitely worth watching no matter what you age is.\r\n\r\nGrade: A",

This movie explores that and tells it from a monster's point of view and what would happen if a child ventured into their world. \n\nI love the creativity they put into Monster's Inc. The part of the movie where Mike asks Sully for some \"odorant\" and Sully gives him \"wet dog\" odorant and tells him to \"stink it up.\" That is just one of many creative things they took from our world and translated it to monsters point of view, it's just so brilliant. \n\nAll the characters in here are lovable and great.

            "content": "Like the TOY STORY films, I knew about MONSTERS, INC. for as long as I can remember. Granted, I didn't really watch it that much as a little kid, mainly because I remember being absolutely horrified by some of the imagery. But I do remember a lot from it. Also, if you didn't know, this was the first Pixar film not to be directed by long-time Disney animator John Lasseter, but by storyboard artist Pete Docter. So it was a pretty risky move to hire a screenwriter for their fourth film. Could Pete Docter direct a good Pixar movie?\n\nYes he could, I loved MONSTERS, INC. and I still do. Like any great animated film, it has a fun and original story with a really creative setup, entertaining and memorable characters with their own unique designs, a lot of great jokes, and has a lot of heart to it. It's not an entirely original concept, we've seen the idea of monsters scaring children and have them return to their own world of monsters as if it's some sort of job. But they have this creative way on why they do this, the screams that the children give off harness the energy that powers the monsters' city. It's also pretty funny that they make the monsters think children are extremely toxic, ironically making the monsters terrified of innocent children.\n\nOur two main characters, Mike and Sulley, are very enjoyable and perfectly voiced by Billy Crystal and John Goodman. The chemistry between them work off really well, I genuinely feel they have a strong friendship. People seem to have real mixed feelings for the little girl, Boo. Some find her absolutely adorable and some find her really annoying, and I can see both sides of that. Personally, I find her absolutely adorable. The relationship with Boo and Sulley is the heart of the film. I love how the bond between them grows as the film progresses. And when they eventually had to separate at the end, it's a very sad but touching departure because you really feel something for them. Pretty much anything with these three characters are great.\n\nThe villains, on the other hand, aren't all that interesting or even enjoyable, at least when comparing them with the protagonists. I like the designs on them, but their characters are pretty under-developed. Randall is the typical jealous villain who just wants to be the best of the best. Mr. Waternoose doesn't want the company to go out of business, but he should know that he's obviously not doing the right thing to stop it from happening. There really isn't a whole lot to these characters, you could've made them diabolical and a lot more enjoyable.\n\nThis film also throws in a lot of humor using many forms of comedy, and for the most part it delivers, which by definition makes this the funniest out of all the Pixar films. It's humor that both kids and adults can enjoy, even though a lot of the humor is kind of childish. The animation is also really well done. The unique designs on the monsters really stand out and makes each character much more memorable. The textures on some of them look amazing. Take a look at Sulley's fur, the details are unbelievable, you could practically see every individual hair on him. And the way they animate the scene where they go through all these doors makes the climax a ton of fun to watch. It's like being in an amusement park ride.\n\nEven though I don't think MONSTERS, INC. is among the greatest Pixar films, I still love it. The concept is very creative, the comedy in it really works, most of the characters are very entertaining, and the animation still looks really good. That's more than enough to recommend.\n\nGrade: A-",

            "content": "In the aftermath of my lukewarm review of The Incredibles, someone asked me what I would consider the great PIXAR film. I didn't want to give an immediate response without revisiting all the titles I had loved the first time round, before my critical faculties had developed to their current level. But until such a point in time, Monsters, Inc. is a very good candidate, being a truly great children's film with all the hallmarks of what makes PIXAR great.\n\nAll the best PIXAR films have a simple but engaging premise, from which an entire world can be constructed. With Toy Story 1 & 2, it was that your toys are alive and will miss you when you're not there. What could just be a gimmick was expanded out into a fascinating, complex and heart-warming story about childhood, jealousy, rejection and the fear of being abandoned. PIXAR have always been very good storytellers, laying the proper foundations of a world in which memorable characters can flourish.\n\nWith Monsters, Inc., the premise is equally straightforward: there are monsters in your wardrobe (closet if you will), but they are more afraid of you than you are of them, and they rely on you to function. From this idea is built up the entire system of the factory for harnessing children's screams, the means by which monsters can travel to our world, the hierarchies within the workplace, and the central comic conceit of a child who escapes into the monster world and isn't afraid of Sully or Mike.\n\nEven in this set-up, Monsters, Inc. presents itself as a really great twist on monster stories, giving insight into the nature and purpose of monsters in our childhood and culture. It's a film about children learning to grow up and face their fears: either the monsters simply cease to be scary (as happens early on, when a door is shredded), or the children end up actively laughing at them, which the monsters eventually embrace. The discovery later in the film that laughter is more powerful than scares reinforces this message about standing up to your fears and overcoming them. It also ties in with one of PIXAR's overarching themes, namely coming to terms with the people we love growing up.\n\nThere is also a neat little role reversal in the film regarding the choice of monsters. The employees at Monsters, Inc. are assigned to a specific child to extract the most possible scares out of a given subject. Rather than the children creating the monsters, as manifestations of their fears and uncertainties, the monsters are tailored for them in the hope that their fears might manifest themselves. This approach within the fictional universe is complimentary with PIXAR's notions of creativity: their films have broad appeal but they are built around emotions and feelings that children will respond to, rather than asking them to respond to something they know nothing about.\n\nOn an entirely different level, Monsters, Inc. is also a film about good business practices. The prosperity of the company is directly in proportion to the quality of life enjoyed by its employees. At the start of the film, everyone is working flat out to avert an energy crisis and the management keep complaining when anyone falls short. They even resort to underhand tactics to achieve their goal, rather than thinking the problem through with their employees at the heart. In contrast, Sully's management decisions, from the new energy source to the brighter colours in the workplace, make dealing with the daily grind a lot more fun.\n\nThere are a lot of wonderful touches to the visual world of Monsters, Inc. which reinforce the business angle to it. Mike and Sully's world has a lot of blue-collar qualities, from the helmets to the metal lunchboxes, but unlike The Incredibles, it doesn't feel like these adult characteristics are being forced upon a younger audience. The paperwork conversations are structured much better and take up less time than the insurance conversations in Brad Bird's film: not only are they shorter but they are not an integral part of the story. We get a sense of how Monsters, Inc. works as a company without Pete Docter having to labour over details at the expense of his characters.\n\nWhile Docter needn't labour in his storytelling, there are a number of nice references to monster movies buried in Monsters, Inc., reinforcing our impression of PIXAR as a thorough team who are passionate and well-researched. The restaurant at which Mike and Celia eat is called Harryhausen's, after Ray Harryhausen, the great stop-motion animator and special effects pioneer. Celia's hair is reminiscent of the Gorgons in the Greek Myths, in which Harryhausen dabbled at the peak of his career. There are also several little nods to other PIXAR works in Sully's last scene with Boo: she hands him a Jesse doll from Toy Story 2, the ball from the PIXAR logo and a clown fish (Finding Nemo was in production at this time).\n\nEven if you don't pick up on all the film's deeper themes or references to other works, Monsters, Inc. is still a great piece of storytelling and a really funny family comedy. While Mike and Sully haven't become quite as indelible as Woody and Buzz, they still make a great double act with believable characterisations and great physicality. John Goodman's lugubrious delivery is beautifully balanced out by Billy Crystal's fast-paced dialogue, and unlike many Dreamworks productions it feels like the famous faces are playing characters rather than just letting loose with their own distinctive shtick.\n\nAlongside the main pairing, there are a number of really good performances in the supporting cast. Jennifer Tilly is very good as Celia, her gravelly voice capturing the harsher side of the character while being suitably smitten with her \"googly bear\". Steve Buscemi is well-cast as the villainous Randall, with the role playing to the same slippery, scheming quality that he brought to Fargo or Reservoir Dogs. James Coburn, in his final performance, balances the mentor-like role he has to Sully with all the ruthlessness and frustration surrounding his position. Best of all, however, is Mary Gibbs, who is simply adorable as Boo. Gibbs was only two-and-a-half she was cast, and was so restless that the recording staff had to follow her around with a microphone.\n\nMost of the humour in Monsters, Inc. is visual, but it's superbly timed and really quite inventive. The scenes involving the CDA are wonderfully over-the-top, parodying any number of scenes in thrillers where a SWAT team must invade a building and remove a threat. Many of the best gags are throwaways, like the jelly-like monster slipping through the grating in the street, or Randall's multiple colour-changes when Boo is bashing him over the head. There's also some good dry humour between Roz and Mike regarding his paperwork, and when Crystal is required to improvise, it's a lot funnier than his stuff in The Princess Bride.\n\nWhile Monsters, Inc. isn't primarily an action film, it does have several good set-pieces which will keep children entertained. The door chase sequence is to some extent a one-upping of the luggage chase at the end of Toy Story 2, but it's still executed in a very neat way with good editing. Similarly the scenes with the Abominable Snowman (voiced by Toy Story alumnus John Ratzenberger) results in a decent slice of action with a solid punchline. Neither of these scenes are particularly ground-breaking, but they do punctuate the slower, sadder moments.\n\nMonsters, Inc. is also noteworthy for the visual leaps it made, for CG animation in general and for PIXAR'S aesthetic in particular. The film utilised a new animation programme called Fitz to accurately produce the appearance and movements of Sully's hair, including the correct amounts of shadowing on different parts of his fur. Without these innovations, Docter's subsequent film Up would not have looked half as inviting. Ironically, the title sequence feels like a product of 1960s Disney, being reminiscent of 101 Dalmatians in both its pacing and design.\n\nMonsters, Inc. is a great and funny family comedy which still holds up really well after both 12 years and its recent prequel. While its technical innovations can be marvelled at in hindsight, its real achievements lie in its beautifully crafted story, great characters, memorable performances and the nuanced ideas that these raise together. While it's not quite up to the high standard of Toy Story 2 or Finding Nemo, it remains one of PIXAR's finest achievements.",

And of course the villain is Steve Buscemi. The voice actors are great and so is the story. Its the fear that we have all felt growing up. The monster in the closet. But what happens when we view the fear from the other side? Well this movie is just great, its filled with moments for both kids and adults and gets better with each watching. Its one of those feel good moments that transport you back to when you were a child having your parents checking the closet for monsters every night before you went to sleep. Certainly a flick that should belong in everyone's collection.",

            "content": "We know they are Best Friends, but how did they meet? We get a new adventure with Mike and Sully, but not how we know them. This time we are going into their past and joining them for College. Mike Wazowski has dreamed of being a screamer since his elementary school visited, and he is old enough to attend Monster University (MU) and pursue his dream of being a scarer. Quickly things fail to go as planned for him, and he loses his spot in the scaring school because of an arrogant big wig named James P. Sullivan. Enemies since they met, Mike and Sullivan have to learn to get along and win their spot back in the scaring school. Watch and enjoy the journey of how Mike and Sullivan went from enemies to the amazing scare team we met back in 2001.\n\nMany sequels fail to make us go back to that day we watched the original for the first time. They miss the mark almost every time, but for the first time in a long time, I think that's not the case. Monster's University redeemed sequels for the time being. I was a bit nervous about the movie before its release in theatres since Disney bought out Pixar, but I was really impressed with MU. It felt like the same people made it that made the original which i think is an important aspect when your audience is now in their late teens and early 20s. I loved the fact that the writers and animators made references back to the original.\n\n\nThe movie remains light and fun for the majority of it. While at the same time, the movie really touches on the realism of a friendship. It shows the struggle between being friends and being honest. Mike and Sully struggle through having a real relationship and afraid of hurting each other. There is a strong sense of work ethic and consequences for wrong doing. \nWhile it may not be the best movie out there, I thoroughly enjoyed it, and it stayed very true to its true nature. It strikes your heart at the core and brings the five-year-old out in everyone. This is one of the hottest movies from the summer of 2013, and in my book, it'll be hot for a long time to come.",

I thought the monsters where of little imagination, there was a very predictable plot with obviously laughter replacing being scared which was clear after 30 minutes, a somewhat complicated idea of screams creating energie/ the whole door-thing, etc. Furthermore, when the kid arrived, it was all a bit 'chasing the small girl' way too much, making this movie to have a sort of childish 'monster versus baby' look and feel. Yes, of course Pixar and Disney did, once again, a great job animating the movie, but it's nowhere near as exiting or as good as many other classics such as Finding Nemo or Toy Story. It didn't suck, but it wasn't great either.",

            "content": "After loads of complaints that animated films as Toy Story, Toy Story 2, and Chicken Run didn't get nominated for Best Picture, the Academy created the Best Animated Feature to respect the world of animation. The first three nominees for the award were Pixar's Monsters Inc., DreamWorks's Shrek, and Nickelodeon's Jimmy Neutron. While Shrek was the big winner, the true winner in my perspective goes to Monsters Inc. Being their fourth feature, after Toy Story, A Bugs Life, and Toy Story 2, Pixar started to hit the home run in CGI animation.\r\n\r\nThe film takes place in an imaginary monster world where the monsters believe that human children are toxic and due to this, their electricity is powered by children's screams. Employees at the corporation Monsters Inc. are responsible for scaring the kids and collecting their screams. But as the times change, kids are less scared, causing a \"scream shortage\" in the monster world. In these times, the top scarer, James P. Sullivan, or Sully for short, and one-eyed assistant Mike, are dedicated to keeping their world alive. When a human child named Boo makes it out into the monster world, Mike and Sully realize that humans are not toxic at all, and they then have to risk their lives to get Boo back into her world before she ends up in the wrong hands, such as the Child Detection Agency (kind of like the CIA for monsters) or the sneaky rival competitor Randall.\r\n\r\nIf you look at all the films Pixar's ever made, and ranked them all, Monsters Inc. is a bit divided on the list. Some say that the film is one of Pixar's all-time best, while others but it near the bottom of the list, claiming they liked it, but not as strong as other Pixar greats. If you asked me where I ranked Monsters Inc. on the Pixar list, I would put the film in the middle of the list. Why? While the film is certainly no Toy Story, the film is still an impressive, funny, and sometimes heartfelt Pixar offering.\r\n\r\nI was really impressed with the story behind this film. The idea that monsters are afraid of children and believe they're toxic was a hilarious idea on Pixar's part. Because of this, this is a great film to make kids not scared of monsters in their closets or under their beds. Like what Jim Henson succeeded with in the Muppet monsters, Pixar helped make many like monsters, including myself as a kid.\r\n\r\nThe animation, like any other Pixar film, is fantastic. While some moments, like A Bugs Life, seem dated nowadays, such as Randall's reappearing scenes (he's a monster that can turn invisible), the film still pulls me in to the incredible monster world. Sully's fur is drawn incredibly well and the designs for Mike's green skin is spine-tingling awesome. Even more impressive are the action sequences, including a climax involving closet doors. It's very impressive. \r\n\r\nMonsters Inc. is one of Pixar's many comedies, and it's certainly very funny. Besides the idea of monsters being scared of kids, the slapstick comedy from the Mike character is very hilarious, especially if your a young kid, and for adults, there's loads of hilarious jokes that kids won't be able to get, including a reference to Ray Harryhausen and a very funny joke about dodgeball towards the end of the film.\r\n\r\nAnother positive aspect is Randy Newman's score, which is another strong score from the Pixar regular. Besides a fantastic score that's pretty exciting, Newman writes the traditional song he puts in his films, this one being \"If I Didn't Have You\", performed by lead voice actors Billy Crystal and John Goodman, and like his personal best song, \"You've Got a Friend in Me\", the song has a very strong message while having a super catchy tune.\r\n\r\nI was also impressed with the characters and voice acting in the film. John Goodman voices Sully, and was a perfect choice, especially in moments of scenes with him and the child. Billy Crystal voices Mike, and is also  a perfect choice. The film succeeds best with the two actors appearing in CG on screen together. The film perfectly defines strong and long-lasting friendship of the two characters in a hilarious and meaningful way. Mary Gibbs voices the child Boo, and is a cute kid. Nuff said. Steve Buscemi voices the villainous monster Randall and is funny while very menacing. Legendary puppeteer and Mr. Yoda himself voices Randall's assistant Fungus, and provides a memorable appearance. Jennifer Tilly voices Mike's girlfriend Celia, the Monsters Inc. receptionist, and is pretty funny in her scenes. Veteran actor James Coburn, in one of his final roles, voices the crab-like CEO Waternoose, and was another perfect choice. Pixar worker Bob Peterson voices the ugly paperfiling monster Roz, and is very hilarious. And last but not least, Pixar's \"good luck charm\" John Ratzenburger makes a cameo role as the \"Abominable Snowman\", and his small role is a huge highlight in the film.\r\n\r\nIt may not be one Pixar's greatest films, such as Toy Story or The Incredibles, but Monsters Inc. is a visually wonderful, hilarious, heartfelt, and satisfying Pixar film. The voice casting is the high point in the film, and this film clearly deserved to win Best Animated Feature over Shrek. While I haven't seen the prequel yet, Monsters University, I hope that Pixar brings these beloved characters back with a bang like they did with the Toy Story characters in Toy Story 3.\r\n\r\n\"Monsters Incorporated. We scare... because we care.\"",

They honestly really find their groove with this picture, Toy Story 2 showed us how well written their screenplays can be, but we all knew how stunning the animation could be from the original Toy Story. Monsters Inc. though, shows us how poignant of a message Pixar can send to adults, this film deals with themes of corporate corruption and freedom, which are problems that our industrial society face everyday. And these are very mature themes for an animated film, themes that children won't really understand, but nonetheless, they will love its awesome visuals and Pixar's trademark witty comedy. Adults however, will be awestruck by its ability to make you laugh, provoke your thoughts, and most of all, charm you. Also, the voice acting by Billy Crystal and John Goodman is terrific, which makes this film even more enjoyable. I'd say Monsters Inc. is a very innovative film that anyone can enjoy, and is almost as good as the best of Pixar's films.",

Whoever didn't fall in love with Boo upon first introduction, is either heartless or a robot. And furthermore the relationship that develops between Sully and Boo is absolutely touching, while the dynamic of Mike and Sully's relationship is complex and anything but uninteresting.

On its own it is a good film to take your children to, but by Pixar standards I find the film to very average.  I have seen Pixar at their best with the Incredibles, Finding Nemo, Wall-E, and the Toy Story trilogy.  Compared to those films, in my humble opinion, this film does not measure up.\nThe thing that I liked the best about this film is the concept.  The concept is that the monster world is powered by scream energy.  Monsters use manufactured doors as windows to the human world and scare children which give the monsters their energy.  I find that a great concept.  I also like that scaring is more of a business and it has this corporate aspect.  The concept itself is not new, but this film does give its own spin on it.  There is a lot that they could do with such a good set-up.  \nHowever, what they ultimately do with it is underwhelming.  One of the big issues I have with this film is the story.  The story is very clich\u00e9 and not very interesting.  The story is that a little human girl comes into the monster world and our heroes Mike (Billy Crystal) and Sullivan (John Goodman) have to protect her from the villains and get her back to the human world.  Along the way the girl and our heroes (particularly Sullivan) form a bond and realize that humans are not so evil.  I have seen this story before, and I knew what was going to happen ultimately.  \nThe villains were not that interesting either.  The villain Randall (Steve Buscemi) I found to be more annoying than threatening.  He is just a one-dimensional bad guy.  I did not feel much tension or urgency regarding their ultimate goal.  The final showdown at the end was, to be honest, kind of boring.  It was not that exciting to me and I felt no tension.  The last act of Monsters University I thought was done much better.  In fact I thought Monsters University as a whole was better than this film despite that film being quite clich\u00e9 as well.  I just found it more enjoyable.\nThere are many good things about the film.  I did like Mike and Sullivan.  I found that they did have chemistry together and they can be quite funny, especially Mike.  The humor is fine, but not Pixar's best.  I found that the funniest parts were during the third act.  The kids should be very entertained.  The animation is great and it still holds up today.  I did not see it in 3D when it came out last year so I cannot comment on that.  As I mentioned earlier I do really like the concept.\nOverall, most people will really enjoy this movie.  The reason why I am being hard on it is because I thought it was average by Pixar standards.  I have seen Pixar at its greatest and this was not their greatest.  However, you should still enjoy yourself.  The children should love it.",

            "content": "This was only Pixar's fourth film but you wouldn't think it, the visuals on display here are pretty much top of their game even by today's standards. What is so perfect about this particular film is like 'Toy Story' the premise is incredibly simple and derives from everybodies childhood. This is what makes 'Monsters' and the Buzz Lightyear adventures so utterly perfect, they touch on everybody's memories, no one can say they can't relate.\n\nThink about it, the plot is so damn simple its genius! monsters that supposedly live in your closet, that's it! Everybody knows of those deep dark places that brought a sense of dread when you were a sprog, under the bed, behind the curtains, in the cupboard, the closet, in the attic or cellar etc...\n\nThe way this simple idea is fleshed out I like very much, admittedly I may have gone a different route by not using such a factory line based company idea for the monster setup. That's the one thing I didn't really get on with here, I didn't really enjoy the harsh metal surroundings the monsters live in, seemed to cold and sterile, almost alien not monster, kinda too me out of the moment.\n\nVisually its epic, in some aspects, others its more standard, the character of Sulley easily being the most impressive thing going with that blue fur of his (mega merchandise planning of plush toy sales there methinks). I only wish they had stayed a bit more spooky n kooky with the monster world instead of that rather bland clean direction, and 'Monstropolis' which merely looked like a regular US city! what a waste! man I had some ideas for that.\n\nLikewise the characters went from excellent to meh for me. Of course the main two guys are perfect and their voices are pitch perfectly performed by Crystal and Goodman. Other monster creations are nice but lacked the same kind of horror element. Randall (brilliantly voiced by Buscemi) for instance is just a lizard/chameleon whilst Celia Mae seemed to merely be 'Medusa' which was rather unimaginative. There also seemed to be too many generic looking characters if you ask me, blobs and tentacles etc...I would of loved Tim Burton's angle on this.\n\nGotta be honest I also felt like I was shoved out of the moment when the plot introduced 'Boo' the human child. Now I know this is the basis for the entire plot and it is for the younger generation of course but I just thought the whole thing went way too schmaltzy. The little kid was disgustingly cute to point where I really disliked the character and wanted to vomit.\n\nTowards the end as we hit the finale the film does tend to go into a frenzy of fast paced action, it does get a wee bit too frenetic and hysterical as the characters are bounding through door after door. Again its a nice idea but kinda goes a bit too far and takes you out of the moment, you feel tired just watching it.\n\nI think this film is definitely aimed more for the kids, sounds dumb I know but some of these CGI flicks are more universal and can be enjoyed by all ages. This film is the same in that sense but I think its much more kiddie orientated especially with the sweet relationship that builds between Boo and Sulley and the heartfelt ending. I did expect a bit more sarcasm from Crystal with his character but he seemed reigned in a bit to me, clearly a sign its more for the kids this time.",

            "content": "As a teenager I was fascinated by the ideas demonstrated in this monster culture and I loved the diversity of monsters. I think the sheer size of the special features on the DVD helped that.\n\nMike and Sulley do make a good conflicting duo in size and personality. It works for the most part, especially when they have to decide what to do with the girl. I do like Sulley's affection for the kid. Mike can get really annoying at times but he can be fun at other times.\n\nBoo is more of a MacGuffin than a character, though they almost perfectly portray what a 3 year old kid would look and act like. Except... well... I still find it difficult that a kid isn't afraid of all the monsters but at the same time, kids are stupid like that. \n\nThe two villains aren't much. While Randall is violent and smart, he isn't complex and not very interesting. Waternoose does have more character and I do like how he deceives the audience by appearing nice at first, like a real capitalist! I also love how these two move, their animal movements are perfect for identifying them as monsters.\n\nThe irony of the story is an ok idea but I think the story needed more depth. Though at times the story does get too complex as well, like with the factory and romance of the Cyclopes, the scare record, the CIA hazmat people, the Yeti voiced by Ham- there is no reason to care for these parts. Many minor characters do have their moments but not enough to leave a mark, yet also they don't overstay their welcome. \n\nBut I do love the MUSIC and the colors of the film. The tone is lively while being calm for the dramatic moments. I love the jazz, I love the intro theme, it has its moments.\n\nAnd for those who are asking, I am not interested in the sequel AT ALL.",

It's gorgeously animated with a wonderful display of colors throughout, something critics have criticized a little bit in their other films like 'Wall-E\". The voice work is also top notch, with every actor sinking their teeth into the roles and getting lost in the story. Sometimes big name actors distract from the film, but Billy Crystal and John Goodman are fantastic and have excellent rapport. The story is a little simplistic, but the execution is once again what shines. There are so many memorable characters and lines and the world they have created for these monsters is very creative. This is just another example of the kind of films that puts Pixar ahead of everyone else in the genre. It's not quite on the level of some of their more sophisticated work, but Monsters, Inc. is more than worthy of the Pixar name. It's great entertainment for kids and adults.",

Goodman and Crystal are terrific together and even though this is an animated film, their roles as Sully and Mike have to be one of their performances in their career as they made their on-screen alter ego more than just cartoon characters, but real and genuine characters that we care about throughout the film.",

Adults love the film for Billy Crystal's special brand of comedic performance, the picturesque settings, and the camaraderie between Sully and Mike while they try to get the little girl back through her closet door before any of the other monsters find out.

            "content": "Three dimensional film has become a huge trend in modern cinema and one that paves the way for a slew of major rereleases that exploit the graphical effect to boost their box office earnings - Disney launched into this trait with The Lion King 3D at the end of 2011 which, despite being nearly two decades old, managed to top $150 million worldwide - making it a roaring success even without it's $750 million earnings from previous releases. After Beauty and the Beast hit UK cinemas last year, now comes the first Pixar flick to make use of this trending attribute - Monsters, Inc.\n\nMonsters, Inc. takes place within the fictional city of Monstropolis, where best friends Mike (Billy Crystal) and Sulley (John Goodman) work at the eponymous factory to provide global power through scaring children. Though scaring is an easy feat, it's made clear by the CEO Henry Waternoose (James Coburn) that a single human touch is fatal - making the sudden appearance of a little girl in the factory a shock poor Sulley and force him and Mike to return her to her rightful door before their ruthless rival Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi) or the governing Child Detection Agency can stop them.\n\nPixar's 2001 hit proved to be an innovation for both the company and computer animation in general, with a higher focus on lead animators per character and the immensely tricky task of realistic fur rendering to bring protagonist Sulley to life through CGI. The end result, even twelve years later, is nothing short of stunning - Monsters, Inc. is a colourful and exceptionally beautiful film with fluent animation, fantastic lighting and some impressive visual effects. It's hardly different with the 3D effect, which never hurls any surprises at you and ends up being a conservative creator of depth. Half the time I felt like I was watching a brilliant film with sunglasses on.\n\nThe cast is mint, with stars Billy Crystal and John Goodman injecting a lot of humour into our main characters (especially the former) and Buscemi portraying a comedic yet cunning villain in the form of Randall Boggs. The late James Coburn also delivers an excellent if short role - I could go on all day about this but the simple fact remains that Monsters, Inc. contains some of the best voice acting in a Pixar hit. Randy Newman also composes a beautiful soundtrack, packed with emotional enrichment and an equal level of memorability. Dare I say, it makes me, er herm, randy. That's disgusting, I apologize.\n\nThough this 3D release is gratuitous and lacking novelty (proven by it's disappointing box office run), Monsters, Inc. remains an exceptional film from beginning to end with tons of charm, emotion and visual splendour  You won't be blown away by the tacked on effect and it may not be worth the investment to some, but even getting to relive it's glory on the big screen yet again is a delightful treat in itself.",

The main story is that Monsters Inc has a child on the loose and Sully and Mike encounter it and try to get it back home. The sophisticated imagery of Monster Inc is absolutely stunning to look at and very few movies have done that with CGI. I love the scene where they are riding on the doors and you see hundreds of thousands of doors. I love the movie. But the 3D was horrible. Only one part was very good 3D. But the tralier for Escape From Planet Earth had better 3D in it then this! But overall, I love it.\n\n2D Version: 92/100 A-\n3D Only: 45/100 D+",

Luckily for Pixar-lovers, Monsters Inc. most definitely did not buck that trend.\n\n        The Top Scarer, James P Sullivan, and his Scare Assistant, Mike Wazowski, work at Monsters Inc., \u00e2the largest scream factory in Monstropolis\u00e2?, who donate the main power source in the Monster world; screams!  But whilst they scare the children, the children scare them, causing absolute carnage when an innocent little girl wanders into their world.\n\n        The plot that we all know and so many love, Monsters Inc. captured the hearts of thousands people across our world.  That\u00e2(TM)s down to the kooky collection of very imaginative and masterfully animated characters.  From one eye to at least ten, from giant talking slugs to giant talking spider type things, Pixar\u00e2(TM)s wonderfully creative minds have once again created a group of lovable and hilarious characters.  They provide us with slapstick laughs to smart references about Big Foot, from the jazzy opening to the heartfelt ending.\n\n        Not only that, but the storyline is wonderfully woven.  For example the pair are banished from the Monster world and into ours, where they meet the Abominable Snowman.  Also, a somehow heart-pounding chase takes place that winds smoothly through Monsters Inc.\u00e2(TM)s many doors, leading into Earth\u00e2(TM)s most beautiful locations and landmarks. \n\n        However for me, the wonderful connection between Sulley and the girl nicknamed Boo is the deal breaker, the heart-warming bond and care that Sulley shows for the girl is immensely uplifting.  And finally, the animation; you cannot help but watch in awe as every single hair on Sulley\u00e2(TM)s body is magnificently animated, whishing in the wind as he runs trying to save Boo (spoilers) and every bud on Randall\u00e2(TM)s body is perfectly tuned as he whooshes in and out of visibility.\n\n        Taking everything into account, you cannot wrong this film.  The only negative that I can find is that the (very) young audience may struggle to take full grasp of this film.  But other than that this film is simply astounding; funny, charming and beautifully animated, Monsters Inc. not only trumps its astounding Pixar predecessors, but also makes a serious claim as my favourite animated film of all time.",

            "content": "In the world of Monsters, the creatures scare children for energy to run their power.  Things get interesting when a small child from our world crosses over.  Monsters, Inc. is an exceptional animated adventure.  Originally released in 2001, the animation, by Pixar of course, holds up well and is eye-popping.  There are some nice laughs and fun moments and it's got a nice bit of action for an animated film.  The story is smart and interesting and puts a fresh new spin on the monster-kid storyline.  The monsters being afraid of the little girl is a nice touch as well.  There's a nice message here as well and while it might be a bit complicated for the target audience at times, they'll still have fun.  The great voice cast stars John Goodman as James Sullivan or Sulley, the number one scarer in the monster world, Billy Crystal as Mike Wazowski, Sulley's buddy who is basically a monster version of Crystal himself, Mary Gibbs as Boo, the little girl who enters their world through her closet, Steve Buscemi as the chameleon-like Randall, the slimy villain who has different ideas for Boo, James Coburn as Henry J. Waternoose, their boss, and Jennifer Tilly as Celia, Mike's girlfriend.  Also look for a few hidden gems, or five-legged goats in Boo's room!  This film is very popular and was made into a ride at Disney's California Adventure and also an interactive comedy show in the Magic Kingdom.  The prequel, Monsters University, will be released next summer.  While it's not Pixar's best, Monster, Inc has a sweet story and should entertain audiences of all ages.\r\n\r\nGets A-List Rating of: A-List Approved!\r\n\r\nYoutube: youtube.com/Wesida515\r\nFacebook: facebook.com/westroopalist\r\nTwitter: @WesAlist",
