    "summary": "It's the summer of 1983, and precocious 17-year-old Elio Perlman is spending the days with his family at their 17th-century villa in Lombardy, Italy. He soon meets Oliver, a handsome doctoral student who's working as an intern for Elio's father. Amid the sun-drenched splendor of their surroundings, Elio and Oliver discover the heady beauty of awakening desire over the course of a summer that will alter their lives forever.",

Oliver is as despicable as he is in this movie and in real life. At least he played a role true to himself? The age gap is problematic and you know what? I'm gonna say it. I don't care that the culture and laws might be different in Italy. They're 17 and 24 and it's gross. Not only that, but Elio and Oliver only want one thing and it's so boring.",

            "content": "Not to single out this particular premise, but films revolving around gay couples have been terrific over the last decade or so. There was a spark when 2005's Brokeback Mountain was released, which eventually brought us to foreign films like Blue Is the Warmest Colour being nominated for a Golden Globe or Moonlight winning best picture at the Oscars. Call Me by Your Name is the latest film to probably receive many nominations in the coming months, and believe me, the praise is not false. Being a fan of 2015's A Bigger Splash, I was looking forward to Luca Guadagnino's follow-up feature film, and I believe this to be an improvement in the best ways. Exploring the hardships of life and what it means to just kick back and relax every now and then, Call Me by Your Name is a film that's been sticking with me since my viewing of it. While it admittedly won't be able to draw in everyone to the theatres, here is why I believe this to be a fantastic, award-worthy picture.\n\nWritten by James Ivory and directed by Luca Guadagnino, Call Me by Your Name follows a family that lets Oliver, an older graduate student, live in their home for the summer. While this is a common thing, what's not too common is that Elio, their son, will eventually grow romantic feelings toward this man, convincing him to become his lover for the summer. From the age gap between them and having to hide it from the family, their situation isn't an easy one, nor will it be for some audience members, but it really is a wonderful story. This is easily a story that could've stirred up controversy if it hadn't been done with taste, and because of how it was made, I just couldn't take my eyes off the screen. This was made entirely possible by the incredibly devoted performances by Timothée Chalamet and Armie Hammer.\n\nHammer has had his ups and downs through the years, appearing in Oscar-winning films as well as some of the worst films of the year, so his performance here was the most shocking to me. Yes, he's been talent in nearly everything he's been in, but he really gave his all in this performance and I honestly don't think he'll ever be better than he was in Call Me by Your Name. On the other hand, young Chalamet has a very bright future ahead of him. Being a relatively new actor, his chemistry with Hammer was impeccably astounding. Their relationship took a while to grow on me, but once it completely won me over, I found myself wondering if there was anything to really complain about.\n\nIf I had to complain about anything, it would be in its extreme pressure to try your patience. There are very long sequences of silence, making you relax and take in either a romantic moment or the scenery around them, which I also found poetic at the same time, so I actually have trouble coming up with issues, but I have to admit that I did find the movie slow at times. Yes, it's meant to be slow, which is why that complaint isn't exactly valid, but I just have to be honest.\n\nIn the end, this is a truly remarkable piece of dramatic filmmaking and there are some very memorable scenes that keep replaying themselves in my head. One scene in particular that involves Elio and his father Mr. Perlman (played magnificently by Michael Stuhlbarg) toward the end had me in tears. From the brilliantly written screenplay, to the poetic cinematography, to the terrifically calm direction, Call Me by Your Name isn't a movie that I would send the average moviegoer out to see, but if you're a hardcore film fan, I think you'll end up loving this movie.",

            "content": "Timotheé Chalamet and Armie Hammer star in Luca Guadagnino's moving adaptation of Andre Aciman's bestselling novel. Dazzling performances and ravishing visuals propel ‘Call Me by Your Name' into its place as one of 2017's best films.\n\nTimotheé Chalamet stars as Elio, an artistic 17-year-old who spends his summer in the picturesque landscapes of Northern Italy, transcribing music and hanging out with his friends. Being on the cusp of adulthood, Elio also spends his days flirting with his friend Marzia (Esther Garrel) and experiencing love for the first time. His mundane routine is interrupted when American student Oliver (played by Armie Hammer) arrives to work with Elio's father (‘A Serious Man star Michael Stuhlbarg). As the summer progresses, Elio and Oliver form a fervent love, developing a passionate bond that will forever impact their lives.\n\nAmerican singer/songwriter Sufjan Stevens composed two original songs (‘Mystery of Love' and ‘Visions of Gideon') and provides a remix of his own song ‘Futile Devices'. Stevens' music accompanies a variety of songs ranging from classical music pieces to 80s pop songs. The mix of musical genres effortlessly compliments Sayombhu Mukdeeprom's cinematography that echoes the visuals of Joe Wright's 2007 drama ‘Atonement'. Luca Guadagnino miraculously brings together first-class filmmaking to create a delicate, yet heart-breaking story with a poetic story at its centre.\n\nTimotheé Chalamet and Armie Hammer bring their A games to ‘Call Me by Your Name', both providing Oscar-worthy performances fuelled by intense chemistry between them. Chalamet's performance encompasses Elio's intelligence and artistic flair, while Hammer brings Oliver's suave and breezy persona to the screen. Michael Stuhlbarg gives a wonderful performance as does Amira Casar and Esther Garrel. Stuhlbarg's standout moment comes when he gives a touching monologue to Elio after Oliver's departure and ‘to make yourself feel nothing so as to not feel anything' is a waste. However, Chalamet proves himself as a talented performer during the final scene as the credits roll beside him. His performance is a mix of discovering yourself and being a teenager, while also discovering love and how it feels. Both of which tie into some of ‘Call Me by Your Name's complex themes of heartbreak, identity and coming-of-age.\n\n‘Call Me by Your Name' delves into intricate themes like the joy of love and with it the pain of loneliness that comes when you are without your significant other. The film also quite obviously explores themes of sexuality, and covers Elio's journey of self-discovery, an example being the infamous peach scene. Most likely unbeknownst to most of the film's audience is the fact that ‘Call Me by Your Name' is the final instalment in Luca Guadagnino's Desire trilogy. The triad of films is also comprised of 2009's ‘I Am Love', starring Tilda Swinton and 2015's ‘A Bigger Splash', starring Ralph Fiennes, Dakota Johnson, and Matthias Schoenaerts alongside Swinton.\n\nLuca Guadagnino brings a passionate love story to the screen bound alongside a delicate coming of age tale. Brilliant craftmanship and a remarkable screenplay by James Ivory, come together to create a mesmerising viewing experience. The film is an elegant adaptation of Andre Aciman's novel, and it's uncommon to find a film as delicate as this one. Chalamet and Hammer give career-defining performances, never faltering across the 130-minute runtime.",

This movie is about basically a child molester, because he was a grown adult, having sexual relations with a child. And then, at the end of the day that the was so into this man that he was having sexual and inside of fruit. So at the end of the day, I'm not quite sure exactly how I truly feel about this movie, but I think this moving is something to touch on as an adult and realize that this is not great. But also, the only thing that I can rate is Timothée Chalamet's performance as this character, though was over the top and he did a wonderful job for trying something that I would not have been comfortable doing.",

The languid pacing suits the setting of a summer in in 1980s Italy and there are some lovely, deliberate and detailed touches in its symbolism, making it quite lovely in its commentary on the emotions of first love.",

            "content": "What in my opinion is wrong with \"Call Me By Your Name\" directed by Luca Guadagnino is the age of the actor Armie Hammer (in his 30s when shooting the movie), because he plays the role of a 24 year old boy, Oliver, having an affair with the 17 year old Elio (Timothée Chalamet): by no means Hammer can look like a 24 year old person, he just looks like a 30+ year old man, and this gives the story a creepy turn, as if a very conscious adult pedophile was grooming his new, innocent victim, with the even creepier approval of the minor's parents (the father's speech would have sounded magnificent instead if we had the right ages on the screen). \nI doubt that director Luca Guadagnino didn't have any 24 year old actor (or looking like one) available, so I really don't know what to make of this otherwise gorgeously made movie: an attempt to normalising pedophilia? \nTwo actors looking like the novel indicated would have told the story of a genuine summer love; the way the movie looks instead doesn't feel right. With a different actor, I would have given 5 stars.\nHaving said that, Timothée Chalamet is exquisite. The ending scene with the close-up on his face while the music of Sufjan Stevens goes on is just sheer perfection. \nNote for the American audience: don't be shocked by the lack of moral disapproval from Italian movie-goers: in Italy the age of consent is 14.",

He's in a position of power. Romanticizing this is effed up. Just because it's a gay relationship doesn't make it okay.",

            "content": "This is a somewhat nostalgic (its set in 1983), fairly laid back feeling film, set during a summer holiday in Italy. The setting is lovely - it's only described as 'somewhere in Northern Italy' and there's some relatively thoughtful dialogue present, although there are some scenes when the characters don't talk too often. I also enjoyed the classical/instrumental music often played in the background, which gives it a somewhat dream-like/floaty feel or sense. I particularly liked the light piano tunes, which had a bit of an ethereal sense to them at times. The characters seem very thoughtful and it's quite an atmospheric film. I would recommend it, yes.",

            "content": "The whole thing feels like a hazy daydream. A sun soaked Italian villa and town filled with beautiful people in swim wear 70% of the time...who wouldn't want to fuck everyone? So much of it feels surreal, but in the right ways. Timothee Chalomet and Armie Hammer both are naturally actors that are tough to like for me (for VERY different reasons mind you), but their work in Call Me By Your Name is pretty undeniably great. Much of the conflict in the movie is implied. It's legitimate conflict at that - acceptance of homosexuality in the 80s was obviously very different than it is now - but the amount to which this is only implied had sort of had a reverse effect on me where it seemed like the movie was overconsumed with what boiled down to \"rich white people problems.\" That coupled with Elio's (Chalomet) surprisingly indulgent and accepting family simply turns this into a summer romance movie. A very good summer romance movie...but something I truly only have so much patience for. Sufjan Stevens' music that's included is a great analog for the movie. Sufjan's music is great albeit being fairly twee. So unless I'm really there for it in the moment, there's only so much I can endure without grumbling to myself \"Okay, come on guy.\"",
