Maybe it is more difficult to understand for anyone who does not understand all the subtext, the recreation of an epoch of a distinctive neighborhood of Mexico City (colonia Roma), an upscale \"barrio\", where social classes do not collide, but eventually merge, beyond barriers (language, class, education, etc), to create the new post-modern Mexico of our time.",

Pour qui aime le cinéma à l'ancienne, plus statique et soucieux du détail, Roma est un régal. L'absence de couleurs apporte un cachet artistique à l'œuvre, et focalise l'attention du téléspectateur sur la forme des décors et le jeu des acteurs. \n\nSur ce sujet, Yalitza Aparicio, que je ne connaissais pas avant de voir ce film, crève l'écran. Son interprétation, pourtant avare en lignes de dialogue, transmet tout par le visage ; c'est encore plus impressionnant lors de la scène de l'accouchement, qui, en plus de déchirer le cœur, montre tout le spectre de ses émotions.",

I liked the characters, the way they interacted, particularly the childrens enthusiasm, that made me smile.\n\nThis film contains both sadness and hope, at different times. At times the camerawork was quite floaty and could almost make you dizzy as it panned around a large communal area and at other times, the camera appears to be hidden at the back of the room or place the scene is set in, as if the characters are being spied on. It concentrates on both families and community - in some scenes, we see some quite pretty landscape panoramas and in others we're peering out at domestic settings. There are some interesting lines of dialogue, such as 'remember, the mind is the motor for the physical'. Its quite a thought provoking watch and I found it quite tense and gripping towards the end.\n\nI'd certainly say its a memorable film - if your keen on world cinema then its well worth a watch, in my opinion.",

            "content": "\"Roma's\" opening scenes cover a woman cleaning religiously, soapy water splashing over dirty tiles draw your attention to the somewhat mysterious scene. The viewer is immediately drawn to Cleo, the servant of a wealthy family in Mexico City. Alfonso Cuaron's masterpiece \"Roma\" is further elevated by his choice of stars, no household names and yet viewers can not seem to turn away from the film. This being an autobiography of the director's life, we can see the story take flight by the quality of his scenes and the unfolding of the story.\n\"Roma\" the title of the film is the name of the neighborhood where wealthy families live in Mexico City. Cleo, who is the servant of a wealthy family, seems to be a bigger part of the family dynamic than her title gives her credit for. Although Cleo does the cleaning, takes care of the children and much more, she has a special role in this family acting as the glue that keeps Senor Sofia from falling apart. Alfonso Cuaron highlights the mixing of races as we can see Cleo switch back and forth between her indigenous tongue and Spanish and the different lives these two groups live in Mexico. One of the most telling scenes of this economic divide happens when Cleo goes to her village in Oaxaca. We see the dark difference, no comfort, no warmth and no hope.\nMartinez-Avila \n\"Roma\" takes place during a tumultuous period in Mexico, with political unrest, student protest and government retaliation with a paramilitary group called Los Halcones. We can see Cleo caught in the middle of this uproar during a period of her life that is undoubtedly the hardest. The harsh truth of a mother facing a pregnancy alone and a father that wants nothing to do with the child he created leaves Cleo with a plethora of emotion and uncertainty. As Senora Teresa and Cleo stand in a baby furniture store out of the window we can see the beginning of a riot which inevitably makes it inside where we see a young man get shot. The director does a fantastic job capturing the dark and gritty scenes with overwhelming authenticity.\n\"Roma\" captures the everyday hardships that women face on both sides of the spectrum  regardless of societal standing. Filmed in complete black and white could have some viewers lose interest but Alfonso Cuaron immaculate directing evokes so many emotions through that simple color. The way the scenes are filmed gives the viewers the sense of being there with the characters and witnessing them experience the joy and sadness of life. From the movie's calm highs to roaring lows we witness Cleo's emotional innocence get introduced to the hard realities of life, with a fearless protagonist who seems could break down at any moment shows the strength of women and their perseverance. \nOne of the most emotional scenes I have watched in a while is when Cleo is standing in the baby furniture store and witnesses someone get murdered which induces her into labor. We can see the camera look down at her feet and then the sudden realization of a mass protest going on outside along with the urgency to make it to the hospital. With the viewer's emotions jumping from excitement to fright and urgency we can see them driving through traffic to hospital packed with injured protesters. Cleo is still not sure how to feel about her baby. The director Alfonso Cuaron takes us through an emotional roller coaster with a sense that there is no bearing on how or what can happen in this film.\nMartinez-Avila \nIn the film \"Roma\" we can see the intertwining of circumstance affect all classes equally regardless of financial standing. We see Senora Sofia sob hysterically over a failed marriage which is followed by her husband's car leaving their family home. The director gives no context at the time to why she is so distraught and Cuaron seems to flawlessly showcase this trait throughout the movie. Viewers are given small bits and pieces of the plot to only see them play out later in the film which adds to the immense anticipation that leaves us gripping the edge of our seat. A directing masterpiece that was certainly ruminating in the director's head for years seems to flawlessly unfold for the viewer's pleasure. \nIn the end we are left with a heartwarming scene of the family huddled up with Cleo in the center finally revealing all of the immense pain she has been harboring this whole time. \"Roma\" takes death, failed marriage, absent fathers and unveils the truths of unconditional love. We can see a relationship grow through the struggles of everyday life, Cleo the housekeeper becomes an irreplaceable piece of her family. The closing scenes leave us with a plethora of questions, but with a sense that Cleo will be just fine.",

            "content": "Have a lot of admiration for Alfonso Cuaron as a director. Also really like to love almost all of his films (having been mixed on 'Great Expectations'), though 'Gravity' is one of those more appreciate than love divisive films that also boasted some of the best cinematography and direction of that year. Of his previous films am especially fond of 'Children of Men' and 'A Little Princess' (the film that introduced me to his work and is a personal favourite) in their own way for different reasons.\n\nWas really excited in seeing 'Roma', with talks of it being one of the highlights of 2018, one of Cuaron's best films and trusted friends saying how emotional it was and especially praising the cinematography, direction and sound mixing. Nothing was going to stop me from seeing 'Roma' with the praise being as high as that, despite the (from personal opinion) rather condescending detractors being quite vocal, including making ignorant and off-base paid reviews allegations that says more about themselves than it says those they're criticising. After seeing 'Roma', and this is a genuine opinion here, am going to join those praising the film. Praise that 'Roma' deserves every ounce of and more. One of my favourite films of 2018 definitely, and it has been a variable year so that is saying quite a bit, and quite possibly Cuaron's best film.\n\n'Roma', being a semi-autobiographical film, is Cuaron at his most personal, both the writing and the direction. One of the main reasons why 'Roma' did such a lot for me was the emotion, with such brutal thought-provoking realism and poignant, without being over-sentimental, pathos it was the film that connected with me the most emotionally. It also was him at his most thought-provoking and there was no sugar-coating, in fact what was also admirable was the not holding anything back pulls no punches approach. It depicted real life situations and struggles and in a way that was relatable and hard not to get nostalgic or moved over.\n\nThe pacing has been criticised for being slow, it is deliberate but personally was caught up in the emotion and the compelling realism of the very personal story-telling to care. Plus since when has a film being slow ever always being a bad thing? It only is a problem when there's no reason to be and with the subject to me it came over that the deliberate pace for 'Roma' was not an accidental choice. Sure, finding its rhythm is not immediate but it is very rewarding when stuck with (rather than stopping watching after a ridiculously short period of time and then bragging about doing it). The script is sincere and thoughtful, not written or delivered heavy-handedly.\n\nNow we get onto what is especially great about 'Roma'. It is a visually stunning film, have not seen cinematography this amazing, varied or clever in a long time and it complements the evocative setting and the strikingly effortless and atmospheric lighting so brilliantly one is truly immersed. Another major star is Cuaron's direction, showing a visual master of his craft and a person clearly passionate and in love with the story he's telling. Both wholly deserving of major awards attention. Same with the sound-mixing which has all three of the qualities that the cinematography has been described has, so appropriate to the mood and enhances it in a way that few other films this year have done so well. As well as the astonishing and very moving breakthrough lead performance from Yalitza Aparicio, as the most compellingly real and rootable character in a film full of them and strong performances.\n\nIn conclusion, absolutely loved it. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Roma is a film that takes you to Mexico in the seventies. With a very simple script, this movie addresses very controversial issues, such as racial discrimination, family violence, injustice, and the deep social gap that exists in Mexico.\n\nSummary:\nThe film \"ROMA\" tells a year-long story in the life of a wealthy family in Mexico in the 70s. The family is composed of Sofia who is the matriarch of the family, her husband Antonio who is a doctor and never is at home, Teresa the mother of Sofia, and four children. They live in an upper-middle-class neighborhood located in Mexico City called Roma, the reason for the title of the movie.\n\nThe story in this film is told from the point of view of the servicewoman, Cleo, who not only cleans the house but takes care of the children of this family. Cleo is a girl from a minority indigenous group who speaks an unusual dialect, and this is why she is undervalued and relegated to household cleaning tasks.\n\nSofia discovers her husband's infidelity and decides to end their marriage, causing a great impact in the lives of everyone in her home that is dealing with their challenges. Cleo has just discovered that she is pregnant, but her boyfriend Fermin decides not to take responsibility for his son and abandons Cleo. These events cause the gap of social differences to be broken. Cleo, with a broken heart, finds refuge in Sofia and her family, who are dealing with the same feelings of confusion, disappointment, sadness, and anger.\n\nAnalysis:\nThis film shows us the social problems in the lives of Mexicans, problems such as insecurity, racism, classism, patriarchy, and family violence. At the same time, it pays tribute to those women like Cleo, who lovingly raised other people's families, despite the social role to which they were confined.\n\nThrough the eyes and experiences of Cleo in simple things such as going to the grocery store, or going to the movies with her boyfriend, it is shown to us the events that shook Mexico City in those turbulent years, including the massacre of students known as the \"Corpus Christi massacre\".\nIn the film, we can see how the role of servant is limited to people of indigenous origin. Despite receiving payment for her services, Cleo's role as a servicewoman is more like the role of a slave who is confined to domestic work due to the lack of opportunities for her ethnic origin.\n\nThe film shows the predominant role of Antonio in the home. When Antonio comes home after work, the whole family puts themselves at his service and tries to please him with every word and action. These scenes clearly show Sofía's role at her home; her role is limited to raising their children and taking care of the well-being of her husband.\n\nThe scene in which Fermín tries to hit Cleo in her stomach, knowing that she is pregnant, is another clear example of the violence and sexism that exists in many Mexican homes.\n\nThe history in ROMA is fictional, but it has something of an autobiographical story. Director Alfonso Cuarón draws inspiration from his childhood to paint a realistic and emotional portrait of domestic conflicts and social hierarchies during the political turmoil of the 1970s. The director showed us that there are many injustices in the daily life of Mexican society; however, many of those injustices\n\nThe film has many particularities that are worth noting. In the first place, it is recorded in black and white which gives it a nostalgic character of the 70s, the time in which the story takes place. The movie is shot in Spanish but includes dialogue subtitled in Mixteco, an indigenous language from the Mexican state of Oaxaca. As an interesting fact, two of the protagonists belong to this community, making their debut as actresses.\n\nCritique/ recommendation:\nI was very surprised by the simplicity of the film and the plot.\nIn Mexico, this film was not well received, and I think the reason is that the scenes in the film are what we see every day in our lives. It is a story that all Mexicans know and that we have seen thousands of times in thousands of versions. However, there are the shots, the vision with which the scenes are presented that makes this film artistic. Every detail is studied and has a special meaning.\n\nEven when the story itself is not a milestone, the beauty of the images and the aesthetics of the sounds makes this movie unforgettable. Roma is the film that everyone must watch to understand the most common challenges in Mexican society. I recommend this movie with 5 stars.",

Set in early 1970s Mexico, it tells the story of Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio), a beloved maid who tends to the needs of a wealthy couple navigating their way through a separation and their four children.  It's as simple as that.  Where the film shines is in the presentation, high-lighted by beautiful black and white cinematography, the camera slowly and artfully panning and tracking its way through the lives of the family as they interact with Cleo.  There are also a handful of deeply emotional scenes (the birth of Cleo's baby, the attempted rescue of the drowning children, etc…) that will haunt to viewer long after the film has ended.",
