What makes it most noteworthy, however, is its performances. Christian Bale, in particular, is excellent in the leading role and it is surprising that he did not convert his Oscar nomination into a win for his work there.",

Christian Bale gives a pretty good performance, not the best of his career, but certainly decent. Amy Adams gives a good performance as well, but i expected a bit more from her character. The best part of this movie was Steve Carell his laugh, i died of his laugh. The hair and make-up departement did an incredible job, transforming Christian Bale into Dick. The screenplay is decent, the story is quite interesting, but some of the creative decisions are bad. By the end of the movie you have seen the whole system of nature, frame frames and some bad editing, which takes you out of the movie. Overall an interesting story, but quite bad creative decisions.",

It doesn't give us enough insight into Cheney's origin story to be a true biopic - it seems like only the pieces that could be gleaned from press clippings.  It is for SURE a hit piece on Cheney and more generally the baby Bush administration.  This is a shame, because I think a 'what went on behind closed doors' film would have been interesting and educational.  Instead, you can't tell what really happened because you don't know how much is biased.  I don't disagree that all of the morons should be in jail for sedition, but I don't know enough about what went on to regurgitate a cohesive narrative.  Then there are these weird lapses into fantasy that totally don't mesh with a serious narrative.\nI suppose if you just don't like Bush and Cheney and want a quasi-whimsical fantasy, this would be a great film to watch.  Rockwell and Bale turn in some pretty good performances.",

I love Bale's portrayal of Cheney as an overachieving loser that manages to become the deFacto \"most powerful person on Earth\".  Amy Adams is great as his wife.   Steve Carrell terrific as Rumsfeld.  I loved looking at Washington DC politics, from Nixon to Bush 43 and beyond; albeit through a specific lens.   While this is clearly not pro-Cheney I do appreciate the view of him as a family man and his predominant protection of his daughter on LGBTQIA issues.   The Direction and Cinematography are great.   The humor is high.   The drama is appropriate because of the circumstances surrounding 9/11.  I liked this a lot.",

While the performances are typically really good as the main entertaining highlight defining its value, the initially predicted discomforting nature is secondarily a political revelation, thoroughly and mindfully reflective \u2013 without really going deep on certain aspects otherwise it would stray, in satirical form by believable accuracy that focuses on one man's representational sole focus of gaining power and demonstrates what it does \u2013 and it unfortunately continues with point proven through its conclusive summary.

He enables two open-ended, unwinnable wars and a regime of offshore torture sites. When he shoots an acquaintance on a hunting trip, the war and torture tsar wins a televised apology from his victim.

Christian Bale delivers an outstanding performance as the most powerful vice president in American history, and perhaps the darkest shadow behind the throne in a century. Every mannerism and tic of Dick Cheney is replicated in an eerie fashion, including the cold glare of hard steel eyes. \nThe rest of the star studded cast delivers very effectively, recreating iconic figures that shaped the bridge between American centuries of rise and fall, and to this day impact our lives in ways we can and cannot imagine. \nVice is absolutely essential viewing for anyone interested in studying inflection points of history, where a series of determined decisions can lay the tone for a century to come. Trump did not fall out of the sky, he rose from the ashes of the Cheney administration. The ground work was well laid in the form of alternative facts, subversion of law and order and unilateral decision making. The concept of the all powerful, unassailable unitary executive is now the modus operandi of many an aspiring dictator all over the world, the age of democracy is ending. I lived through those precedent shattering days and well remember the internal fear. \nMore insidious is the results of the lies - a destabilized middle east and the resulting geopolitical aftershocks reverberating in Yemen and Ukraine; a collapsing climate with a brutal outlook for most of humanity; a demolished series of walls between executive, judiciary and legislative leading to utter injustice and chaos. \nThis ongoing century of American decline can be traced back to Vice and its depicted decisions, setting the course of the world for a new era.",

In addition, Vice works as a great introduction to the politics within the White House during the George Bush administration. Vice does come off as a very one-sided argument though, which I can see many people posing it at a propaganda film, but the events are not portrayed in a manner unfair to Dick Cheney. They present the information as it occurred and as things happened during that time, and they even remark on it in the end of the movie.

Bale really sinks into the role of Cheney, but Amy Adams equally so as his wife, Lynne, shown to be interesting and dynamic in her own right.

Infact the tone of the acting is comic throughout but there are no real jokes.

With \u2018Vice', McKay does the same thing tone-wise that he did with \u2018The Big Short': apply an unusually light tone to a period in history that was anything but; whilst that worked with the latter film, it doesn't always work here. \u2018Vice' seems to be more focused on entertaining than anything else and, as such, ends up being a rather superficial look at a period in US history that significantly changed the way the Western world works (for the worse) and the man who, arguably and according to this film, was behind it all. Sure, it's pretty entertaining with a few flashes of brilliance, but despite that, you can't help but feel that it's a bit too serious of a topic and the negative effects too lasting not to have dug a bit deeper.",

Christian bale deserves an Oscar for this role. I've never seen him so different before , maybe Batman but man he was phenomenal in this movie. Another stand out is Steve carrel.

Some of the parallels to the Trump administration are a bit too on-the-nose, but far from inaccurate. Bale's performance was solid and clearly was the result of considerable dedication, though it descends into overacting at points; despite the periodic criticism that he receives each time he dives into method acting to take his body to some physical extreme, the critical approval never seems to be far behind.

One would be wrong.  The writing is atrocious, the editing is clunky and, by the time the end credits begin to roll, it feels like a movie with an identity crisis.  Listed as a biography, a drama and a comedy, \"Vice\" never really seems to find any foothold in any one of those genres.  If anything, the movie feels like a liberally-slanted satirical biography that tries too hard to dramatic and funny.  The drama is underwhelming, and the comedy feels forced.\n\nThe lilies among the thorns, though, are the brilliant performances of Bale (Dick Cheney), Carell (Donald Rumsfeld) and Rockwell (George W. Bush).  Not unexpectedly, these three truly captured the spirits of the roles they portrayed, with Bale turning in an astounding performance that tops all his previous efforts.  Were it not for the awful editing of the film, Bale's performance could easily make you forget that he's NOT Dick Cheney.  The physical and vocal transformation into the much more public Cheney that we're used to seeing is spot-on, and reminds us, once again, of Bale's acting excellence.\n\nUltimately, though, the cast just can't save the film from itself, making it fall well short of my all-time \"Must See Again!\" movie list.",

            "content": "\"I will not apologize for keeping this country safe\" is a line the Dick Cheney character says near the end of Adam McKay's new movie Vice. According to the film this phrase is how Richard Bruce Cheney justified his actions throughout his career in Washington. Now I am not here to talk about his politics or how his actions affected America. I am just here to judge this as a stand alone piece of work.\n\nAs I said earlier Vice is Directed by one of my all time favorite directors in Adam McKay. If you are unfamiliar he is a former SNL writer has directed Anchorman, Talladega Nights, Step Brothers, The Other Guys and The Big Short before this. The Big Short is the one we are going to focus on though, because it seems McKay starting honing his new style during that film. His style is so different and interesting because it involves a ton of cutting back and forth between scenes; however it also involves him creating scenarios where narrators explain complex ideas in Layman's terms. The latter made the Big Short and Vice much easier to follow for people who may not follow the financial and political worlds in depth. He brings that style to Vice in very effective ways and it makes the movie very enjoyable to follow.\n\nEven though he is such a private guy (as the movie jokingly points out) we get to see a good mix of Cheney's early life in Wyoming and then his later political life in Washington DC. He is portrayed as a master maneuverer and someone who knew how to find power in any way possible. I will say there are times the movie drags and a couple cuts that just feel unnecessary.\n\nStarring in this is one of the All Timers in Christian Bale. He is probably the best actor in the world right now since Daniel Day Lewis says he's retired. Bale transforms into Cheney unlike anything I have seen since the aforementioned Day Lewis became Lincoln. He looks like him, talks like him, and just makes you believe everything he did on screen Cheney did in real life. Bale is so damn good in this movie he is absolutely in the Pantheon of greatest actors in History and is my front runner for this years Oscar.\n\nHis partner in crime (take this one of two ways) in the movie is Donald Rumsfeld played by Steve Carell (in a much different role than Welcome to Marwen). He gets to basically act like an ass all movie while portraying a man who surprisingly kept positions of power for a long time. There is an interesting dichotomy of apprentice and master with him and Cheney throughout the movie that is fun to watch. Of course Sam Rockwell is great playing an especially goofy George W. Bush, he gets to put on a southern accent and smile at Christian Bale's grimace.\n\nThe last performance to highlight is the always great Amy Adams. Every time she is in a something she just brings it, one of the more reliable actors out there. She has a good mix of understanding and intensity this movie that would be hard to match for any other actress (god damn I sound like an asshole).\n\n*A Couple other Tidbits:\n\n- Tyler Perry (A long way from Madea movies) give some stirring work in only a few scenes as Colin Powell.\n\n- Watching Cheney turn on his daughter was heart wrenching (not a spoiler it happened in real life).\n\n- A Condoleezza Rice character gets a line or two in this, thats fun.\n\nThere will of course be people upset with how the Republican party is portrayed throughout the movie. If people can separate themselves from that and just enjoy, they might find this is one of this years gems. I really hope McKay continues to make movies like this.\n\nJuice Rating:\n84/100",

A 130 minute film about the 2008 housing crisis should have been a snooze fest, but thanks to great performances, a ballsy, energetic script and a directorial style that seemed to make up the rules as it went along, it was electric. So I had high hopes for this, a 130 minute film about George W. Bush's monotone vice president. And I wonder whether it was those high hopes that scuppered my enjoyment a little. It's a good film, with good performances, anchored by a fantastic performance by Christian Bale (he's very often very good isn't he?). But the same energetic, scattershot approach as The Big Short somehow fails to elicit the same enjoyment. Maybe it's because it doesn't have the surprise factor? Maybe it's because it doesn't have the benefit of multiple story strands? Whatever the reason, there's only flashes of brilliance in an otherwise rote story. The narrator played too big a role for me, which took me away from the proceedings. Apparently there were other scenes (including a musical number) that Adam McKay took out of the film to give it a more serious tone. I don't really understand the thinking behind that. It's already a film that does some crazy things, so why not shoot for the moon, like your previous film did, and go all out? Use the absurdity of your approach to make serious points about serious things. There's plenty of straightforward films out there already.",

But overall it's just watchable. The movie just feels a little hollow, probably because there wasn't a central theme running throughout the movie. The best part about the movie is definitely the performances, Christian Bale, Amy Adams and Sam Rockwell give off really great performances along with Steve Carell doing an alright job. Overall, Vice passes the time and it has some memorable performances and plot elements, but it's not enough to be great.",

For any of those who only heard about this movie thanks to the Oscars, just know that everything that was said about this movie was a complete lie. For example, many times during the ceremony, announcers claimed that Vice shreaded the usual structure of biopics. This is true for the last half of the movie. The first half is hardly structured in a unique way. The second half of the movie, though, is. However, you'll have wished that it wasn't because it completely goes off the rails. First things first, the movie does this weird thing where rather than looking at big things during the Bush presidency and how Cheney was involved-- what was literally advertised in all the trailers and marketing--the movie instead decides to have Christian Bale make a dick joke and then montage through Enron, most of the Middle East, etc. There are only three things looked at: the concept of the Unitary Executive, 9/11, and the Invasion of Iraq. The movie then sloppily transitions to Cheney's life after the Bush Presidency. He ditches his lesbian daughter to help his other daughter win a local election and then does an interview where he oddly breaks the fourth wall and tells the audience that he did everything he did because he's the only one willing to do what's necessary. At this point of the movie, I realized that the movie's greatest problem was that it lacked any message. The last ten minutes convey the idea that Cheney was willing to do whatever it took to win and to keep Americans safe. However, those same ideas don't show up anywhere else in the movie. Christian Bale and Amy Adams give good performances, but it's just not enough to save this mess. Easily the most disappointing movie of 2018. \n\n3/10",

The direction by Adam McVay was really good, using a lot of visual similes and metaphores and the editing put them all togheter with perfect timing, making some of them highly momorable. Unfortunately it's not all perfect. In fact the biggest problem was the missing sense of the movie, not because is something cerebral but because it raises a question: \"what was the point of doing this film?\". I'm not from the US so I'm not into the American politics and its propaganda, which I felt was the main aspect of the movie. Because otherwise is a film about the cruelty of human beings, in particular of Dick Cheney, but if the message wanted to be this one there could be other numerous better subjects to base a film on. In conclusion I liked the film, and particular its direction that was unique but at the end of the day it gave me nothing, except for the fact that Dick Cheney was a very ruthless man.",

            "content": "This will surely go down as one of the strangest Best Picture nominees of all time as it didn't receive a positive critical reception, deservedly, but I suppose liberal politics mean more to Hollywood than the quality of the film itself. With talent like Jesse Plemons and Amy Adams on-screen I was hoping for some great acting and although I'm not a fan of this new phase of Adam McKay's career I was hoping for some interesting political commentary. It's approach is definitely better than most films about controversial politicians like The Iron Lady (2011) which chooses to neither praise nor criticize Margaret Thatcher for the political decisions she made. Vice is most definitely an attack on Dick Cheney and that point of view allows for a decent argument to be structured and clear characters to be molded and displayed to an audience who may or may not agree with the message of the film.\n\nMcKay employs the same winking at the camera style used in The Big Short (2015) with almost every character breaking the fourth wall, celebrity cameos, sardonic voiceover, a fake ending and an entire scene delivered in iambic pentameter. His subject is Dick Cheney, Christian Bale, who he views as an evil, power-hungry politician who is responsible for most of the political turmoil in the United States during the 21st Century. Along for the ride are hapless politician George W. Bush, Sam Rockwell, his Lady Macbeth-esque wife Lynne, Amy Adams and the mentor that he eventually succeeds Donald Rumsfeld, Steve Carell. Voiceover is heard throughout the film from Kurt, Jesse Plemons, who has his real identity revealed in a particularly irritating scene.\n\nI mentioned my only praise of the film in the opening paragraph because beyond it's clear political intentions there is nothing of merit in this film. It's utterly smug in the way it delivers it's various \u00e2~jokes' but unfortunately none of them are particularly funny. Even the breaking the fourth wall moments didn't feel playful or special it just seemed like McKay was far too impressed with his own abilities as a filmmaker. It was almost like watching a Jean-Luc Godard film where it's impossible to divorce what little substance the film has with the pretension of it's director. As previously mentioned I am usually really impressed by any performance that Adams gives from Enchanted (2007) to Nocturnal Animals (2016) but here she was just sort of meh. If I wanted a great Lady Macbeth I would watch Erszebet Kutvolgyi and don't get me started on the Shakespearean scene.\n\nThe film is very, very obvious in that the word \"Power\" is said in an extremely serious tone by nearly every character in the film in every scene and the film's uncomplicated thesis is summed up within the first ten minutes of the film. Dick Cheney wants power at all costs because\u00e2\u00a6.he wants power. Yes he was a drunk disappointment and we are lead to believe that he wanted power in any form but all of the reasonings are either clich\u00c3 (C) or nonsensical. A film like Secret Honor (1984) actually spends time pondering why Richard Nixon had such a voracious appetite for power and his backstory and outside influences on him are delved into fully. Vice avoids any nuance and all elements of Cheney's personal life are dealt with gracelessly as his difficult relationship with his homosexual daughter Mary, Alison Pill, is exploited.\n\nIf you are a liberal angry at your fellow Americans for having elected politicians like Dick Cheney and Donald Trump this film will be able to get you fired up and angry at what you may see as an unjust political situation. Personally, I felt isolated at times because I don't feel any burning rage at Cheney being a non-American and the fact that the film often got caught on what felt like personal grievance removed a certain shine from it. The waste of talent is staggering and I hope that Adams and Bale can team up again in a film as entertaining and funny as American Hustle (2013). Hopefully the Academy can let go of Adam McKay because if he produces another film this middling and unfortunately poorly made it would be ridiculous to nominate it for Best Picture.",

He nails all the little ticks and mannerisms of Cheney in each scene. The acting across the board is strong. Amy Adams (Lynne Vincent Cheney) might be at her best alongside Bale in her career (American Hustle, The Fighter) and that was the case again here. Sam Rockwell (George W. Bush) is a show stealer in a limited role as the former President. Steve Carell (Donald Rumsfeld) is also great. Obviously, the makeup effects in this are fantastic. There's a reason that department was Oscar nominated. The film is mostly well written, with interesting scenes and sharp dialogue among the characters. It gives a very interesting look in how one man rose through the ranks of the political world and how much influence Cheney had on a lot of things.\n\nWeaknesses: Adam McKay often beats us over the head with the message of the movie. There are times when he tries too hard to showcase something, as if he doesn't trust his audience's ability to understand it all. Often, there are parts of the story that feel kind of dull. That causes some pacing issues and the two hour runtime ends up feeling closer to 2.5 hours. \n\nOverall: I can see this being polarizing. While I'm not as invested in the political agenda, I found this to be an entertaining film that deserves a ton of praise for the work of its actors.",

Vice is a decent biographical comedy drama film which follows Vice President Dick Cheney (Christian Bale) from his earlier years in 1969 when he dropped out of Yale from alcoholism to interning during the Nixon Administration. Working his way up in the office from Secretary of Defense to being a Vice President in the 2000 Presidential election. This film may not be for everyone. I am not into politics. Adam McKay\u2019s direction on handling this biographical film about Dick Cheney does feel quite uneven. Yes, he is trying to adapt the story onto the big screen while keeping fresh and have some comical moments of trying to light up the mood. Which it works, I did enjoy some parts of the film. It does leave the movie feeling a little odd in the end. The film is narrated by Kurt (Jesse Plemons) who is a normal American civilian which has an impact and connection when it comes to the climax of the film. The movie does break the fourth wall barrier to explain to the audience about the whole situation with Dick Cheney. If it is good or bad information being given, all comes down to how the individual audience would take it. Christian Bale did great as Dick Cheney. His physical performance of gaining weight for the role and changing his hair appearance. His acting was great. Amy Adams was also good playing Lynne Cheney. Steve Carrell was also good as Donald Rumsfield. Sam Rockwell playing George W. Bush was also good. Adam McKay does a great job in handling a film with a serious topic that can easily create a controversy. He tries to make it understandable for audience who are into politics or not. I still enjoyed his other drama film The Big Short more. Overall, Vice is a fair film. The performances are great. Adam McKay\u2019s direction did seem a little off balance with trying to be funny in a serious topic. ",

Illegitimate-son-as-organ-donor would have been plausible, but the implication was never addressed again in the movie, nor was it substantiated.  A human heart donor for Cheney was explicitly shown, despite fact that Cheney received an artificial heart.\n\nThe scenes depicting 9/11 fail to address Norman Mineta's testimony to Congress concerning Cheney ordering an Airman not to deviate from orders not to intercept a missile heading toward the Pentagon.\n\nScenes depicting Cheney as a drunk are highly derivative and mostly untrue.  The creators of the movie, \"W.\" could not have done a better job of cloning their own movie.\n\nToward the end of the movie, there is some sort of absurd implication that everything bad that ever happened in the world, even after the end of the Bush administration, somehow stemmed from Cheney's Vice Presidency, from wildfires to the opioid crisis.\n\nThe transposition of news coverage and commercial advertising from the 9/11 era added a splendid dynamic, a dark sort of nostalgia.  This was perhaps the greatest... and only... triumph of Vice.  Charitably a 3/10 for effort, taken down to a 1.5/10 because of the jab at Trump supporters in the post-credit scene.\n\nIt begs the question: If Cheney is the ultimate evil in the world, what is the need to associate him with Trump?  And if vice versa, then why make a movie about Cheney when Cheney has already been covered in other movies such as, \"W?\"  Why not make a Trump movie instead?\n\nThose involved with the making of this movie seek to draw a neat line connecting Nixon, Cheney, and Trump, despite the fact that there is none.  To suggest otherwise is pure sophistry.  If the problems of the world were so easy to divine, they would have been solved once and for all long ago.\n\nVice is by its own admission partisan, and it is the height of arrogance to believe that 'hanging a lantern' on its partisanship (as it does in the final scene) negates that fact.\n\nP.S. 'ne'er-do-well' does not mean what the writer seems to think it means.  Really, what kind of script-writer seeks to \"translate\" a term STILL IN USAGE TO THIS DAY so that it can be understood by the lowest common denominator?

The first half though was just crap; McKay just kept shifting us back and forth, here and there, while skimping through history without adding anything much to it. I felt that the point where Rumsfeld shuts the door on Cheney after he asks \"What do we believe?\" epitomizes exactly how I felt about the first half: it was an essay film that didn't know what it was trying to say. The second half though, was surprisingly excellent. Maybe it was my disgust towards hearing such history for the first time, and I admit that may have influenced my rating, but damn is McKay a savage on some of those fantastic metaphors. I'm not a Shakespeare guy, so I didn't like that bit, but the mid-credits and then the freeze zooming into Bush as a fish ready to be baited by Cheney was spot on! And that scene at the restaurant! My goodness was that darn amazing. But it was the ending twist on the narrator and the pan on Cheney's old heart, only for his self-centered legacy to continued by his daughter, that smacked me in the face, finally convincing me to forgive McKay for the awful first half. Such a realization of the heavy personal consequences of Cheney's actions, juxtaposed with the way the government had treated it as a game, was to me a powerful and highly timeless message that was very well communicated. Credits as well to Bale, who was electrifying especially in that final scene, where he somehow humanizes Cheney while still portraying him as a bastard. Really liked Carell and Rockwell as well.",

            "content": "Dick Cheney\u00e2(TM)s apprenticeship during Nixon, Ford and Reagan, private sector exodus during Carter and Clinton and ascent to nearly unlimited power as Bush Jr\u00e2(TM)s running mate / handler. It\u00e2(TM)s hopeless to argue that this film doesn\u00e2(TM)t have an agenda - the trailers alone should have made that abundantly clear - and it makes no effort to hide or balance that essential bias. Cheney is played as a man who values nothing beyond personal gain, even going so far as to ask \u00e2what should I believe in\u00e2? during an informal chat early in his career. He\u00e2(TM)s less transparent later on, as his understanding of political gamesmanship improves, and by the time he\u00e2(TM)s asked to join the GOP ticket in 2000, he can ask for the moon.\n\nBasically, we\u00e2(TM)re watching the birth of a hardened super-villain without the inconvenience of actually breaking any laws. Or, I suppose, of being caught for doing so. That\u00e2(TM)s serious subject matter, but the tone varies unexpectedly from grim and straight to playful and silly. Often several times in one scene, which makes for a somewhat confusing viewing experience. It can\u00e2(TM)t decide between hammering an important point and nailing a ripe punchline, valiantly tries to accomplish both and rarely succeeds at either. A gimmicky narrative style and ambitious use of jump cuts further muddy those waters.\n\nThe acting follows suit. Some scenes are rich and effective, Christian Bale becoming the lead role in more than just a physical sense, while others just... don\u00e2(TM)t work? Steve Carrell\u00e2(TM)s casting as Donald Rumsfeld is a good example; a take that could have really come together, but plays instead like a weird mix of his better-known parts in The Office and Anchorman. It\u00e2(TM)s an entertaining film and an important story, with a few hooks that almost sink in, but struggles with tonal inconsistency and an inner conflict that\u00e2(TM)s never completely resolved.",

Yet, as with typical leftist tactics, the movie's writers flip the script and tell the exact opposite of what actually happens to make the liberals look like the good guys. What a straw man fallacy.

            "content": "\u00ef\u00bf 1/2I want you to be my Vice.\u00ef\u00bf 1/2?\n\nComedic writer-director Adam McKay tries, and fails, to bring the same energy and insight from his Oscar nominated examination of the 2008 financial crisis, The Big Short, to the most notorious vice president since Aaron Burr. Vice is the story of the rise to power of Dick Cheney and how he changed the executive branch\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s use of power forever and for the worse. The film opens with a title card informing the audience that this is an attempt to tell the story of the most secretive figure in recent American political history which is a difficult thing to try. It\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s not a good sign when before the movie even begins it apologizes for itself.\n\nChristian Bale plays Dick Cheney and we see him first as an aimless drunk in Wyoming in the 1960\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s that, spurred on by his wife Lynne (Amy Adams), cleans up his act and becomes the right-hand man of Donald Rumsfeld (Steve Carell) during the Nixon and Ford presidencies. Watching him enjoy his quiet accumulation of power and the satisfaction and status it brings during the 70\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s and 80\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s is the most interesting segment of the movie. Once the film hits the W. Bush years when Cheney acted behind the scenes to increase his own personal power and wealth Vice should hit its stride, but instead it goes on autopilot and plays like a tired collection of Cheney\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s greatest hits. Vice is very angry at Dick Cheney and condemns him plenty for his actions but that is like picking low hanging, blatantly obvious fruit.\n\nChristian Bale is great as Dick Cheney. The strength of his performance is, naturally, from his skills and talent as an actor, not just from the makeup he is under and the weight he gained for the role. He speaks with that low growl I remember so well from the W. Bush years and imitates perfectly the small laugh and smile Cheney would sometimes let slip. Cheney was not much of a public speaker or campaigner so his wife Lynne steps up and rallies people to her husband\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s cause. This is where Amy Adams gets to step out from the bland role of \u00ef\u00bf 1/2wife of a biopic subject\u00ef\u00bf 1/2? to be an active player and interesting character. Bale is nominated for Best Actor and that is no surprise. Amy Adams has earned a Best Supporting Actress nomination, but she played essentially the same character, and played her better, in The Master. Sam Rockwell, in full goofball mode, plays George W. Bush and though he's barely in the movie, Rockwell has picked up a Supporting Actor nomination. \n\nThe life of Cheney is narrated by Jesse Plemons playing an average American and Iraq War veteran who says he\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s related to Dick Cheney... in a way. When we find out how he\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s related to Cheney it causes cringes and eye rolls. In The Big Short McKay used a hyperactive and self-aware filmmaking style to excite and engage the audience about a pretty boring and convoluted subject: the stock market and investment banking. He used cameos from stars like Anthony Bourdain and Selena Gomez to explain complex financial ideas and practices using clever and easy to understand metaphors. There is nothing complicated about how Cheney grows and abuses power. He asks a lawyer if what he wants to do is okay. The lawyer says yes. There\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s nothing hard to follow there but McKay has the narrator hold our hands through it anyway.\n\nCheney\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s final actions in the movie are meant to play like a final heartless betrayal signifying that he is beyond all hope of redemption, but Vice never presented him as someone with anywhere to fall from. That would only happen with a movie that attempted insight into its subject\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s emotions and motivations and even dared us to sympathize with the unlikeable main character. In Nixon, Oliver Stone built up audience sympathies for Nixon and then let him squander and betray those sympathies making his fall all the more tragic even though you rooted for him to fail. With Nixon, Stone posed the question: What does it profit a man to gain the world if he loses his soul? (this Bible quote actually appears at the beginning of that film). In Vice, McKay forgot to ask any questions, attempt any insight, or speculate on motivations. This movie has only one message: this Dick Cheney is one bad dude. If you were born before the year 2000, you don\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t need a movie to tell you that.",

Just like The Big Short, Adam McKay once again blends real-life events with hilarious satire and it works extremely well. The film does a great job of showing us an important moment in history and the man responsible for it. I personally found Vice absolutely hilarious as it often breaks the fourth wall and directly addresses the audience allowing for the audience members to really be their own characters in the film. There was one moment in the middle of the film that I couldn't stop laughing at and I'm so surprised that they were able to do that. It is incredibly funny, super meta and absurd.\n\nChristian Bale absolutely nails the character of Dick Cheney, he is resilient, backstabbing, and ruthlessly ambitious. I almost forgot Bale was playing him until there was a flashback where you could tell that it was him. I was that absorbed in his performance. It is, by far, Bale's best performance. He completely transforms into Dick Cheney. Steve Carell and Amy Adams also give stand out performances. Jesse Plemons has a role in the film which is brilliant and extremely humorous.\n\nMcKay took so many risks making this film. So many things happen that you would never expect in a biopic just for the sake of comedy and I loved it. The editing is incredibly energetic - some of the most ambitious editing being utilized for an incredibly unique narrative structure. This definitely isn't your standard biopic. I love when filmmakers stray away from the standard and break conventions, McKay definitely did just that.\n\nVice definitely isn't a film for everyone (as shown by the mixed reception). The film\u00e2(TM)s highly ambitious narrative structure and editing will turn a lot of people off, and there is absolutely no subtlety, which I personally loved. I really enjoyed McKay\u00e2(TM)s unique approach to the story. Oh, and by the way, the last line of the film is literally \"I can't wait to see the new fast and furious movie that looks lit\" (No I'm not joking)...",

            "content": "Four years ago, Adam McKay made one of the most entertaining and educational films about the economy and the explosion of the great American real estate bubble with The big short. With agile and pop culture language, the director simply explained how some broke down and others profited greatly in the American mortgage crisis. In short, there was a bunch of hawks who caught a chance and went hunting. \"Vice\" follows the same model of language, narrative, and premise. The only difference is that it does not have the same humor. Perhaps there is a slight irony here, another there, but it was really impossible to portray the life of what must have been the most active vice president of American history with humor.\n\n\"Vice\" is the story of a man who was no one and who became the powerful vice president of George W. Bush's government (2001-2009). The film is pitiless with Dick Cheney (a Christian Bale in a state where there are no adjectives to praise him). In the first part, it portrays Cheney like a failure, alcoholic and mediocre student. In the remainder of the film, Cheney is an opportunist who knew how to ride the sealed horse of history and lead himself to the highest echelons of American government with an extremely conservative thought, without measuring any consequences and trampling whoever he wants to be on the ridge of power. And definitely this portrait could not being different.\n\nCheney was for a long time almost a ghost, but the film compacts with and confirms the hypothesis that he was the iron arm of the Bush administration (Sam Rockwell). It was up to him, with a series of maneuvers and counting on the active participation of coreligionists in various instances of power, to stretch US legislation to the utmost to start groundless wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. All with the consent of a weak and almost servile president to Cheney's wishes and who did all the will to have him side on the plate when running for the presidency with Democrat Al Gore.\n\nNarrated by an American soldier, which was a good part of the film, \"Vice\" shows how a mediocre person who had everything to become an irrelevant human being, ended up grabbing an opportunity to do an internship in the US Congress and stuck to right people in power. The first was Donald Rumsfeld (Steve Carrell), Gerald Ford's former chief of staff who also held positions in the Nixon administration and became the Secretary of Defense for the Bush administration.\n\nThe film gives the impression that Cheney was, in fact, an invisible leader to the public of a whole generation of Republicans and the voice of the American conservatives against the \"advances\" implemented by the Democrats who, by the way, occupied the White House. In the case, since Cheney emerged on the political scene, the only presidents from the democrat party were Jimmy Carter and Bil Clinton, who commanded the White House for 12 years. The Republican presidents were four - Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George Bush and George W. Bush - commanding the White House for a total of 23 years. Barack Obama has come to represent the end of the Cheney generation, now 78 years old. But by then much damage was done.\n\nIn fact, the peak of Cheney's power was when he held the vice presidency. Cargo that as the film shows, he only accepted after studying on how to turn it from something he considered insignificant to powerful and without any kind of surveillance. At the same time, it demanded then-candidate Bush the right to take care of a number of strategic areas for the American government, such as energy and the military.\n\nCheney saw the opportunity, as the movie jokes, to become a Galactus, the devourer of worlds in Marvel's comic books. This is how he did it. With the conviction that he was doing the right thing, and the best of Bale's performance is the demonstration of this conviction so real and crystal clear, Cheney turned the world into a worse place by starting a war in Afghanistan against Al-Qaeda to hunt down Osama Bin Laden. But the Bush administration's so-called War on Terror was not enough to win the support of the American population. It took a palatable target for the people. A country with borders and a leader.\n\nIt was in this way that Cheney united the useful to the pleasing, the desire to remove Saddam Hussein from power, and began a war in Iraq with false information and manipulation of news that convinced even the press and the world's leading leaders. In return, what Cheney gained was the direct responsibility for the creation of one of the largest terrorist organizations in the world: the Isis.\n\n\"Vice\" is relentless, didactic and has a cast of actors who only brighten the film further. Bale is a monster in the lead role, but Amy Adams is not far behind making Cheney's wife, Lynne. And there are Steve Carrell and Sam Rockwell very well, as well as actors in smaller roles who have successfully incorporated Mckay's idea of storytelling based on connections with pop culture and agile and light language, even though at various times the film get nauseous.",

The movie is surprisingly lighthearted and gives a do-not-take-me-seriously feel. This is rather ironic given how impactful the decisions and actions of the political figures are. I have not watched a lot of Adam McKay's works, only the Anchorman films. But the way this movie progresses and how the different scenes are cut together actually really reminded me of the Anchorman films. Static images thrown in between moving scenes parallels the one-liners that the Anchorman films are known for. Overall, I highly recommend watching this movie.",

It was truly masterful, and I would barely believe it was him if I didn\u2019t know better. There were some other strong performances as well, but none that were quite as astounding as Bale. The movie takes a look at the history of Cheney\u2019s entire political career from his early days as an aide for Donald Rumsfeld to his years serving as Vice President, but presents it with the same kind of tongue-in-cheek style that Adam McKay used for The Big Short. While I\u2019m no expert, it certainly feels like they approached their research for this film from the standpoint of Dick Cheney being the devil incarnate and made sure they compiled as much evidence as they could find to support that fact. When you walk out of this film the lesson you are left with is that Dick Cheney and his cohorts are responsible for every awful thing in our country today, and we are at risk of future cataclysmic disaster because of him as well. While I\u2019m not a political person, and would never claim to know enough about the inner workings of the government to disagree with what is presented in Vice, it\u2019s the complete lack of subtlety in Adam McKay\u2019s film that bothers me the most. In one scene they give an example of the way Cheney had the ability to propose ridiculous ideas and make them seem reasonable. They present this with a fake conversation where he suggests that the president and his staff walk out on the White House lawn, drop their pants, and twirl their penises around for the media. That\u2019s what watching Vice felt like to me. It was Adam McKay flashing the nation with all the junk he could find about the Bush-Cheney administration, with as much brashness and boldness as he could muster. There were some funny moments and I definitely laughed a few times, particularly when he exaggerated reality or played with the traditions of film-making. Sadly, the film felt too mean-spirited to be convincing or informative. And just to drill that point home, there\u2019s a scene during the end credits that presents anyone who takes issue with what is presented in the film as a violent mad-man unwilling to listen to facts.",

The film is accurate in character development and its script-pleasing artifacts are very different, few habitual, but at one point end up weighing in the rhythm of the long, but end up containing a good part of a long republican political history in just two hours , its weight is normal and the assembly devices serve to relieve it, although in practice this does not work as well.\nTechnically, the feature uses a lot of montage and dictation, leaving everything more frenetic and appropriating several analogies that fit very well, in addition to an excellent sense of humor but not always visible, \"Vice\" can tire many viewers, but those who have already been hooked for their bait, will remain glazed until the end, it is worth highlighting also for the editing and sound mixing that is magnificent, another point that is splendid is their makeup, Bale is unrecognizable, Amy Adams is old, everything is very faithful to the original cartoons and work very well in the film, we already have a guaranteed Oscar here.\nThe film was very acclaimed for its performances, but in fact, Chtistian Bale is great, aggravating his voice and giving a unique weight the same, every time that Dick speaks, it is not in vain, everything has a very strong weight, we owe this to the Bale's vocal work that also gives us a change of physique that goes far beyond makeup, showing a commitment to acting, and finally, his mannerisms, his posture, even the way the protagonist moves his glasses has an air maleficent of wisdom, manipulation and intelligence, is a firm and robust performance, caricature but undoubtedly reliable and accurate. In addition, Amy Adams is well, makes a fundamental character, with much depth and dramatic charge, but its indication to the oscar was exaggerated.\n\"Vice\" finally fulfills his role, is a good movie, addictive, funny, dramatic with depth, script, direction and acting, with some problems is true, abuse of editing and confusing explanation of facts, assertion of events that do not are proven and bar forcing, but we can not fail to see that it is a fiction based on real events, nothing more, but certainly is one of the highlights of 2019.",

If McKay was succinct and accessible before, he seems more superficial and a little simplistic here. Structured like a conventional biopic, but with humourous, surreal even, interjections and tomfoolery to liven up the proceedings while casting aspersions on events and people, the film remains an effective and alarming portrayal of Cheney as a master manipulator, whether against Donald Rumsfeld (an impressive Steve Carrell) or running rings around George W. Bush (a reliable Sam Rockwell who got the nomination that Carrell should have). Vanishing into the roles of the Cheneys, with the aid of subtle yet convincing make-up, Christian Bale and Amy Adams's nuanced, almost humanizing, performances gallantly resist the temptation to simply vilify them as the devil, despite Bale citing Satan as his inspiration in his Golden Globe acceptance speech. However something seems amiss, as this film doesn't feel as sharp or as entertaining as The Big Short. As a result of Cheney's secretive nature and his seemingly very effective removal of any revealing, if not incriminating, records, the film is left with conjectures, suppositions and speculations, and ends up feeling like a condensed run-through of Cheney's career in PowerPoint form. Nevertheless, as a history lesson dressed up as entertainment, Vice is well made, thoughtful and relevant for our times, and scarily ends on a cautionary note that Cheney might not be the worst we will endure in our lifetime.",

            "content": "Paving the way for a biopic of Trump as a Mafia mobster Vice takes a scurrilous and deeply disturbing look at Dick Cheney's personal and political life. Never quite sure whether it's an expose with a human heart, a black comedy of manners or just a simple character assignation Vice rambles on through Dick Cheney's life in roughly chronological order (his early life and DUIs are often in flashback), but there isn't much of that. We also get a seemingly random character who comments on Dick Cheney's life and whose importance does emerge at the end of the film, but in an awkward weird sort of way. \nAwkward and weird could summarise it all - both the film and Cheney. That he was a slick and ruthless political operator is never in doubt and is clearly demonstrated. The only man who outdoes him in smooth, vile self political interest is the vile and oily Donald Rumsfield, who is prone to loud guffaws of dismissive laugher at Cheney  whenever Cheney tries to proffer a decent, or  half-way decent, excuse for what they are doing and why.\n\nIt is suggested that Cheney manipulates his way to unprecedented power as a vice-president. It is in keeping with the strangely dislocated feel of the film to mention now one of the funniest scenes is when a supremely well acted George. W. Bush tries to persuade him to be his running mate with BBQ chicken sauce dripping down his chin.\n \nOne reason to watch this film is for Christian Bale's masterful portrayal of Cheney at different ages - always convincing, almost human you  might think. \n\nDick Cheney patriot or villain? There is no doubt that the film portrays him as a villain and as someone who used his power to support the unsupportable e.g. the torture of enemy combatants, the maintenance of the fiction that Saddam Hussein had WMD and was linked with Al- Qaeda. Another point of view to take from the film might be that American politicians of this calibre and rank are eternally distanced from any of the realities of life and play out their fantasies much like Kevin Spacey in House of Cards. It's not a comforting thought and this is not a comforting film.",

I assumed this movie would be another Hollywood hit job on the right, and it was. I thought at least my leftist girlfriend would like it, but she was ready to leave 10 minutes in - and we should have. \n\nIs it asking too much for an ounce of cleverness, humor, or entertainment like Saturday Night Live? Even the narrator, we discover, is Chenney's heart donor and pissed off that Chenney says \"my new heart\" instead of some other guy's heart. Really? The dead heart donor is mad? Have you ever heard anyone refer to their donor organ as \"John Doe's heart\"?\n\nI don't believe for a minute that most of the academy voters actually watched and voted it best picture - ideology over aesthetics again.\n\nIf you hated Bush/Chenney, then you have a chance of liking this film. I didn't have much of an opinion about Dick Chenney before this movie and not much more afterward. He's a quiet man by nature which we're warned through the ominous epigram: \n\n\"Beware the quiet man. For while others speak, he watches. And while others act, he plans. And when they finally rest...he strikes.\"\n\nAll of the speculation was fully disclaimed in text at the very beginning of the film, \"but we fucking tried\", so that makes it ok to have every speculation be negative.\n\nI'm sure when Hollywood makes Obama's movie, they'll have him eating fried chicken with a piece hanging from his mouth and a scene where he gargles for 20 seconds and spits into the sink.\n\nAll that said, however, the makeup artists were amazing! Christian Bale was amazing in both appearance and intonation. I didn't even recognize Sam Rockwell as George W Bush - what a ringer!\n\nSo the 1/2 star is for the makeup, but I'd like my money and 2.5 hours back.

The director takes a unique, clever, witty approach in telling the story because otherwise you'd just have a story of mindless ambition on the part of all the key players and thoughtlessness for anyone else on the planet except themselves and their greed.  And we've seen that story many times in history.  So the brilliantly talented director almost takes a whimsical approach to this age old avarice and selfishness of the ones that stumbled into power.  Great movie making and depiction of human nature.",

I had no real prior knowledge of Cheney and his activities and I\u00e2(TM)m British so I came at the film with a very open mind. All I can say is that the editing and writing on this film is utterly exceptional and even though at points in the film it feels slightly odd or doesn\u00e2(TM)t particularly make sense within a couple of minutes you fully understand what the editing is trying to portray and is truly great storytelling albeit not particularly traditional. Everything is made clear by the end of the film and by the end you will understand some scenes which previously may not have made sense. The cinematography is delightful and the hair and makeup styling is magnificent they did an incredible job on all the cast members who aged. The score was very good also. And finally Christian Bale is genuinely incredible his performance is utterly brilliant and if he doesn\u00e2(TM)t win an Oscar I will be disgusted he is a true master of method acting and the actual acting as a whole truly brilliant.Amy Adams, Steve Carrel and Sam Rockwell are all exceptional and all Oscar worthy in my opinion or atleast  Oscar nomination worthy, obviously Carrel didn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)t receive one but he was terrific non the less. This film has received mixed reviews however I advise people to go into the film open minded and don\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)t look at it from a political perspective. I also say that wait until the end until you judge the film and lastly the film isn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)t conventional and is quirky and different but that\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s why it\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s genuinely so good.",

Vice was better, but still didn't entertain me as it meant to. The film is often clever and biting but also frequently smug, one-sided and too snaky for its own good. Christian Bale's dedicated performance is the main reason to watch it, as the man always commits 100% to his roles and brings to life whatever character he is playing. His movements, his tonal inflections, the habit of drawing a breath before he speaks, his almost constantly tilted head, he knows Cheney inside and out. There's some great supporting payers toom including Amy Adams, Sam Rockwell and Steve Carrell among others, but overall the film is too scattershot to consistently hit its targets. It's use of a non-linear timeline doesn't improve the story, as it takes away from the message of Cheney's incremental rise to power. It does show just how remarkable an unremarkable person can become, through a combination of luck, resourcefulness and a few underhanded tactics, and I applaud it for telling a story most would rarely have considered. It's quite an achievement, but the movie itself rarely reaches the level greatness that its hero fought hard to attain.",

Using the 'fourth wall' breaking techniques he provided in The Big Short, McKay breaks down Cheney's career in a stop start manner. The approach is not as successful because Cheney is not at all funny. He is as serious and evil as it gets in US politics. From Nixon to W, Cheney was at the centre of the Republican right and went completely power crazed post 9-11.\n\nThe film is a polemic and McKay obviously has it in for Cheney for a host of good reasons.

            "content": "The story of America's most infamous vice president, wager of the War on Terror Dick Cheney, is approached with bold satire here by writer-director Adam McKay. Vice acknowledges from the beginning the secretive nature of Dick Cheney and how conjecture is perhaps needed to colour in the edges. Nevertheless, this is a ferociously entertaining film, that lampoons its subject with flashy comedy and stylistic gags. Christian Bale leads as Cheney, caked in impressive makeup. Beneath the prosthetics, however, Bale delivers a stand-out performance, deadly in its quietness and oozing with callous bureaucracy (the actor thanking Satan for inspiration in his Golden Globe acceptance speech is not unfounded). We watch the events of Cheney's life unfold; his unexpected rise from delinquency to vice presidency is told in a biopic that is pleasingly unconventional. Vice is narrated almost like a staid Michael Moore documentary, but is also unfailingly nihilistic, combining the grounded political history within amusing gags. Similarities can be made with McKay's previous film, The Big Short, which also approaches its weighty subject with a cynical mockery that you can't help but grin at. The deeper impact of this film is certainly undermined by the comedy (which at points is almost too light hearted), but Vice still gives a telling nod to the state of politics today without losing its biting humour.\nVice breezes nicely through a sizeable run time, snapping from frame to frame with a manic energy. The structural choices are somewhat zany, but usually add to the film's eccentricity. McKay's writing is unfocused at points and the narrative is far from tight-knit, though this is never at the expense of entertainment. Fourth wall breaks and a memorable scene where the characters break into Shakespearean iambic pentameter are just examples from a film that is wonderfully weird, yet never to the point of ridiculousness. Stylistic ticks like these are less ubiquitous in a final act that relies just a little too much on narration. \nThough Vice is carried by Christian Bale, Amy Adams looms with stony determination as the Lady Macbeth-esque Lynne and Steve Carrell's Donald Rumsfeld is as slimy as he is energetic (Sam Rockwell's Oscar-nominated George W Bush, in contrast, feels a little bit Saturday Night Live). Nicholas' Britell's score is luscious and pacey and Greig Fraser's cinematography is as slick as it is shocking (shots of Cheney's comfortable White House meetings snap unsettlingly quickly to flashes of the brutal torture he authorises). \nVice is not perfect, its wackiness occasionally verging on messiness, but it remains a fervid and clever biopic, that uncovers the career of one of America's most reticent yet power hungry politicians with delightfully bruising derision.",

In the post credit scene is shown a meta language where the characters know they are in a movie and still use an irony of the \"uncle of the pav\u00e9\", speaking of Fast and Furious, even being mediocre I liked a little.",

A great missed oppurtunity to end on a shot that actually means something, Cheney's exsposed heart. I don't know what it means yet, but thats up to the director to imply. But i was happy wiht the eventual final scene they went with. This film is very similar to The Big Short stylisticly, but th eproblem is that film took place over a year or so. this film takes place over fifty years, so the snappy cuts to real footage has to be narrated by a hamfisted liberal who comes off as plain cringewothy. Instead of following a linear timeline, the film decides to hop back and forth for no appparent reason. Many parreles could have been drawn to earlier points in his life, but perhaps they could be done a bit more subtly. As I previouslt mentioned, most if not all jokes in this film fall flatter than an ironing board, espiaclly the one where they preface the film by saying \"We did a pretty bad job and made amy assumptions but pwease don't blame us, it was weewe haaard\"",

But when one turns out to be a hit-piece for one of the most reviled men to set foot in the oval office, you should pay attention, even if the final result is somewhat flawed. Vice tells the story of Dick Cheney and how he became one of the most powerful men in Washington for decades. It's not flattering and is ABSOLUTELY written from a liberal standpoint. (Surprise, surprise.) Oh sure, there are humanizing moments and Vice does present him as a human being who gambled, made mistakes, and cared about the welfare of his family. But it makes no apology in telling you that Cheney is guilty in helping to create the gigantic cesspit that is American public life today. (Oh, and it points the finger directly at the audience and implicates their complacence in helping to create that nightmare.)\n\nNow let's talk about the tone of Vice. It's framed mostly as a dark comedy with absurd cutaways and a tone that is often farcical. \"Breaking the fourth wall\" is a term everyone says these days in the aftermath of Deadpool, but to put it simply there is NO FOURTH WALL in this film. The entire movie is direct satire and will go to insane lengths to remind you that it is. And I think that's what damaged Vice in the eyes of many critics. I think they wanted a more conventional biopic and found the humor and awkward moments irritating. The director, Adam McKay is largely responsible for its comedic bent, as one look at his filmography would quickly explain. Abstract, non-sequitur humor is kind of his shtick. That being said, the fragmented nature of Vice did irritate me especially during the second half. Many scenes felt obligatory or like small vignettes and didn't flow together well.\n\nWhile Christian Bale and Amy Adams as the Cheney's seems at first glance to be bad casting, they really own it. Bale gets his tics, his speech patterns, and his signature coldness down pat. And yes, his physical transformation represents the kind of commitment actors rarely bother with anymore. Adams likewise plays against her femme-fatale type as a cold and square Lady Macbeth, who is less sympathetic than her infamous husband. Steve Carell is quite entertaining as a loose cannon version of Donald Rumsfeld, and Sam Rockwell doesn't quite look like \"Dubya,\" but he certainly sounded like him and I wished he was onscreen more often.\n\nOverall, Vice is an entertaining, albeit preachy political satire that features fine performances and a few good jokes. It was certainly more diverting than one would expect and on occasion I like to have expectations subverted, if it results in something worthwhile. I think it warrants an investigation.",

The contrast of the dark humor and scathing political satire compared to the corruption and power-thirst of US political leaders was undoubtedly a fine line to tread in this film\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s production, but this balancing act was expertly-handled by writer and director McKay.\n\nIn addition to the notable acting performances, another remarkably strong aspect of this film was the surgical precision of editor Hank Corwin. Full of montages, time\njumps, and flashbacks, Corwin had to bring his A game, and did nothing less.\n\nAs for the musical score, Nicholas Britell, (who has been busy working on other other projects such as \u00ef\u00bf 1/2If Beale Street Could Talk\u00ef\u00bf 1/2\u00c2?), brings a fittingly unconventional sound to the table that aligns with the film\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s tone.\n\nGreg Fraser\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s cinematography engrosses the audience in the emotions of the actors on-screen, with intimate close-ups and symbolic shots that represent the situations of the characters on deeper levels.\n\nRounding things out, the production design crew, led by Patrice Vermette, admirably created realistic sets that flowed with the story as it progressed through the years. The hair and makeup department performed equally as impressively, as did costume designer Susan Matheson.\n\nEach and every single group of the cast and crew did their due part to bring together the masterpiece that is \u00ef\u00bf 1/2Vice.\u00ef\u00bf 1/2\u00c2? This one is definitely on my personal short list for Best Picture as the Oscar race is nearly coming to a close.\n\n \n\nGrade: A",

It may look like a pro-Republican biography, and cleverly, it is only a very critical movie that supports some of the most controversial conspiracy theories, such as 9/11, based on some infamous facts and figures.

This film references a Marvel comics character, it references Shakespeare, it has a narrator who's part is more significant than you think, it even has a fake-out ending after the first 50 minutes.

This film is designed to make the audience angry, but perhaps to a fault (although there were only 5 other people in my screening). This film is definitely not pulling its punches in how it portrays and criticizes Dick Cheney and the state of modern U.S. politics (from the perspectives of both the politicians and the populace).

On a personal note, I\u2019ve never thought it fair that Cheney lives while he\u2019s personally responsible for so many deaths (he is the Hitler/Stalin of the US), and this movie shows that; there is no justice in the world, just men like Cheney and us chatel :(",

            "content": "Known for directing comedies like Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, Step Brothers, and The Other Guys (just to name a few), Adam McKay has been taking a slight deviation from his old style. Having recently directed the acclaimed film The Big Short, his comedy met his drama and formed a mesh that a lot of viewers loved. Personally, I wasn't a huge fan of his previous film, so I was a little hesitant on Vice. With that said, Vice is surprisingly one of the best movies that 2018 had to offer. I love when biopics have the freedom of not taking itself too seriously. Yes, there are some very touchy subjects sprinkled throughout the course of this movie, but I had a blast watching it. Aside from awards shows, I don't hear many people talking about this movie, which is a shame, because it's fantastic.\n\nMaybe I just wasn't all that invested in politics enough to know this story, but I found myself very surprised throughout the course of this movie, mainly due to the core focus on Dick Cheney. Vice follows Cheney's rise to power in a very quiet fashion. Having never once been elected President of the United States, his impact on the government was huge. Being an insider who went from bringing people coffee to pretty much running the show for George W. Bush during his Presidency, this story was ripe for exploration. George W. Bush felt obligated to run for President, which in turn made him need a knowledgeable and ambitious person to help him along the way. There are many ways this story could've fallen apart as a feature film, but due to the talent involved, Vice is one of the best of the year.\n\nFrom Christian Bale delivering a stellar, dedicated performance as always, to Sam Rockwell delivering an offbeat and likable performance as George W. Bush, to the likes of Amy Adams and Steve Carell who've always been likable, Vice is littered with terrific performances. Those performances are expected by these people, but I do believe Adam McKay has something to do with that. Whether it's in his older comedies or his recent dramas, he knows where each of his performer's strengths are and showcases them first and foremost. Even in the slower moments of the film, I found myself incredibly engaged, due to the fact that these performances felt so real. Not only do these performances make this a better film, but this is a screenplay that impressed me quite a bit as well.\n\nHaving also been written by Adam McKay, he clearly knew the story he wanted to tell from start to finish. He chose the most interesting period in Dick Cheney's life and went with it. From incredibly weird and interesting choices in terms of where the story starts and stops throughout the course of the movie, I was kind of amazed at how a few scenes didn't crash and burn. Some audiences may find certain choices very strange, but I thought they were experiments that paid off. I can't wait to see what he comes up with as his next project.\n\nIn the end, Vice is the kind of film that would jump at the opportunity to be nominated for numerous awards, but it's also one that deserves the recognition it's receiving. Many of the critics seem to be mixed on this particular film, but that actually shocks me. From weird (in a good way) editing choices to bizarre songs choices, Vice is a movie that meshes a lot of elements together to form a film that feels more like an experiment than a finished product, but that experiment just worked for me in nearly every way. I loved watching Vice and I highly recommend it.",

Whatever - there are many laugh-out-loud moments for me.  It must have been very tempting to call this movie Dick - but I guess there's already an American politics movie called Dick - so Vice.  I'll go 7.8 out of 10 for this.",

There is so much material that is simply guessed and written to sound like a cheesy comic book villain conference instead of trying to sound anything like actual history. This is a story that needs to be told in a truthful way and it rather focused on pouring gasoline on the fire of an already divisive nation by grasping at any straw possible to make Republicans look bad. It's not about Republicans vs. Democrats, its that anyone can be bad given the right amount of opportunity and power, and as a nation, we need to come together to solve this instead of picking sides and shouting we're right and they're wrong. We have to find some way to come together and this does not encourage that.",

While I enjoyed 2005's \"W.\" a bit more this is still a good watch for anyone who has a interest in this era of American Polotics.\nThe humor can be off putting at times and the film does drag in spots but overall its at least worth a watch.\nMy Full Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxf1njyZzyY&t=5s",

A fleshy, sneering Christian Bale skillfully takes us on Cheney's odyssey through the halls of power, from his days as a Nixon-era Capitol Hill intern to his oil grab as Dubya's manipulative, opportunistic (and forever unapologetic) second-in-command.  There's some humor, sure, but given what Cheney conned his boss into doing--in Iraq and elsewhere--hardly enough to turn the film into what could truly be called a comedy.  With Amy Adams as Cheney's flint-hard wife, Lynne, who rescued him from his misspent youth and helped him find his cojones; Steve Carell as a grinning and goofy but no less dangerous Donald Rumsfeld; and Sam Rockwell as the borderline clueless Bush the Younger.  A well-made movie with some awfully clever touches--and, sadly, unmistakable echoes of our current political climate--but an Oscar-worthy masterpiece? No.",

We all know Bush was a puppet, and certainly by now that we went to war unnecessarily based on a lie they concocted linking Saddam to Iraq and nuclear WMD.  They get into that and other atrocities Cheney authorized.  In fact if you're a Republican who voted for George W this movie will either be a revelation or you'll simply get up and walk out.  This is for all the Democrats out there who have been mad as hell about what Cheney did (regarding torture, destabilization of the Middle East, Halliburton etc.) for years.  He certainly laid the groundwork for Trump.  Bale's portrayal is spot-on, and Adams, Carell and Rockwell--all great performances.  Overall Vice gets your blood boiling (if it wasn't already) but there are a few problems with some parts (like the heart transplant for one example).  Still worth watching for the performances, even if it's not 100% accurate.",

I myself have read Cheney's auto-biography as well as many presidential books as that part of America is my own passion. So to be clear I have preference to movies such as this especially when the acting of Adams, Bale and Carrel are amazing. Yet unlike Oliver Stone's Nixon or W the film does not offer a humanity to Cheney. He is a storm of power with little if and or no loyalties. This lack of humanity is at the very core of the film as it suggests that one man alone controlled the world through the ignorance, loyalty or fear of those around him. Sadly it's the fear of you dear Americans that this film is trying to tap into. When voters are straddled to slogans and finger pointing it easily proves the message of this film. It also makes sense of this day and age when Presidents like Trump and Obama who have no governing political experience followed George Bush.",

A mistake so blatant and so obvious that I immediately whipped out my phone to check the running length for the movie I knew I was now about to have to sit through in its entirety. \"Vice\" is also one of the few instances in which a major motion picture release begged the question of \"couldn't this have just been released on Netflix?,\" as there is nothing about this movie that doesn't feel like a painfully quirky mocku-docu-drama for the YouTube crowd. There is no substance, no weight, and absolutely no point to any of it.\n\nTo call this movie biased and non-objective is an understatement. \"Vice\" is so heavy handed and so obtuse in its narrative that it makes Michael Moore seem subtle and compassionate in comparison, and the very trailers for this film suggest an intelligence and linear plots that fail to materialize in the overall actual program. (Looking forward to seeing a lot of Sam Rockwell? Seem like George W. would be a prime character? Prepare to be sorely disappointed.) Even the usually-welcomed presence of Amy Adams seems unnecessary, as almost every aspect of the \"Mrs. Cheney\" character comes across as dull and dead-eyed. This is not due to any fault in Amy Adam's ability, she's merely been given an old egg and told to make it hatch.\n\nI give this movie 1 and 1/2 stars - a full 1 of which belongs just to Christian Bale, who honestly did a fantastic job disappearing into the role. His performance is surprisingly magnificent, which is saying a lot for me as I am not by any means a Christian Bale fan. Unfortunately, no performance by any actor would merit suffering through this awkward abortion of a hipster film-student movie. The only half a star can be shared by Sam Rockwell and Amy Adams, who must have only accepted their parts to pay off some kind of hidden Hollywood gambling debt.",

Just like McKay\u2019s pervious film, The Big Short, Vice is told in a docudrama style with real footage to enhance the utterly frightening & macabre story of Dick Cheney\u2019s rise to be the most ruthless & unapologetic Vice President in US history. The film follows Dick Chaney (Christian Bale) from his party days in college & sloppy lummox days after prompting the ultimatum that his wife Lynne (Amy Adams) gives him after he receives a DUI. Chaney takes it to heart & begins a steady climb in politics beginning as an intern & cultivating a instructive & profitable friendship with Donald Rumsfeld (Steve Carell) which leads to great success in the public & private sectors. By the time then Governor George Bush (Sam Rockwell) approaches him to be Vice President, Chaney is already extremely skilled at ruthlessly acquiring power & position and brokers a deal with Bush which will grant him uncommon decision-making authority & control which he does not hesitate to wield. This impressive all-star cast also features Tyler Perry as Colin Powell, Alison Pill as Mary Cheney, & Lily Rabe as Liz Cheney but Vice totally belongs to Christian Bale, who gives a scary good performance as Dick Cheney. The physical transformation that Bale makes from one character to another, the massive weight loss he did for The Machinist, to buffing up for The Dark Knight trilogy & 40 pounds gain to play Dick Cheney is impressive. It was deeply disturbing to witness the total disregard for the constitution & laws supposedly governing this county by the elected officials & no less disturbing to witness the ruthless betrayal of family as well. Vice was nominated for six Golden Globe awards: Best Picture, Best Director & Best Screenplay (Adam McKay,) as well as Best Supporting Actress (Amy Adams,) Best Supporting Actor (Sam Rockwell.) Christian Bale took home the Golden Globe for Best Actor. SEE THIS FILM.",

            "content": "My spouse and I went to see Vice last night, as we both enjoy history. The previews made the movie appear to be somewhat comedic, which also appealed to us. Sadly, we were disappointed on both counts. This movie is a slow-moving piece of political propaganda that utilizes overt emotional manipulation to couch carefully selected and presented facts such that they appear to be a complete picture of the circumstances surrounding the rise of the Bush-Cheney White House. \n\nWhat I liked about the movie: There were a couple of rather funny scenes, although they were extremely short. The inclusion of \"focus group\" scenes depicting the means by which words were selected for use in advertising, debate in Congress, and speech writing definitely added to the quality of the finished product. These were among the best scenes in the movie, in my opinion. And the actors were well chosen and did a reasonable job with the script, particularly Christian Bale as Cheney.\n\nWhat I did not like: The characters were pretty much flat cartoon versions of the people they were supposed to present. There was no character development whatsoever. No one changed. No one learned anything (with the exception of Cheney when he realized that drinking and carousing was going to lead his wife to leave him). While the sweeping facts in the movie are accurate, the writer started with a preconceived notion of who he wanted Cheney to be, then selected the facts he thought supported that and scripted around them to present the message. This fictionalizes the characters without making the fiction clear and apparent, which means that Mr. McKay is essentially deceiving his audience with intent. Critical events like Desert Storm (during which time Cheney served admirably as Secretary of Defense) are glossed over with barely a mention. McKay's script requires Cheney to be a virtual unknown hidden man, despite the fact that he was actually well-known in political circles. He was, perhaps, not so much a household name as Colin Powell during the 90s, but he was far better known than the movie portrays.\n\nThe lack of any presentation of underlying political philosophy in Cheney's, Rumsfeld's, and Bush's drive to power is inaccurate. It completely ignores the neoconservative movement that was an extremely active and influential subculture of the time. It also contributes to the lack of character development. The only incentive presented for all their effort and financial investment is a desire for power. And while the executive theory was a major philosophical concept of the time, the use of power merely because it is there to be used is a poorly utilized  and inaccurate plot point here.\n\nThe thing I disliked most about the movie is that the points presented were couched in an emotionally manipulating format. For instance, the narrator of the movie is the man whose heart Cheney received in a transplant. The man negatively comments later in the movie that Cheney calls the heart \"my new heart.\" The impression given is that Cheney doesn't care about the life that was lost in the process of saving his. But transplant recipients are not normally given any information about the donors. At the point of the transplant, that did become Cheney's \"new heart.\" An (admittedly generalized) comparison is the purchase of a used car. It is no longer someone else's \"old car,\" but is now the current owner's \"new (to me) car.' They probably won't go about to seek out information about the former owner. They will go on with the things in their lives. Which is pretty much what Cheney has done. Presenting the happy family scenes and the soldier scenes to depict the life of the donor manipulates the viewer into seeing Cheney as heartless and uncaring about the person whose heart he has, as though an unfair and heartrending sacrifice was made for an undeserving lout. I go to movies to be entertained and sometimes informed, not to be manipulated. I resented that deeply.\n\nPerhaps the most telling scene in the movie is the bonus scene at the end of the credits. In the final focus group, one (very conservative) member comments that the movie is a liberal propaganda piece. Another responds that the movie only contains facts. A floor-rolling fist fight between the two characters then ensues, while the other members of the focus group go on with their unrelated conversations. Honestly, this was my favorite scene in the movie, because it portrayed fairly well the way politics plays out in everyday modern life.\n\nOverall, the movie deserves one star for the final scene and for Christian Bale's adaptation of Cheney's speech patterns and mannerisms. But the weaknesses of the plot, the historical inaccuracies, the lack of character development, and the emotional manipulation lead me to grant it no more than that. That movie was a couple of hours of my life I won't get back, sadly.",

            "content": "Vice Review: Vice is the story of Dick Cheney, Christian Bale, and the events leading up to his term as Vice President. I was excited to see this movie because they gave it a comedic route and also all of the actors and actresses in it. When the reviews came out they were very mixed, even getting a bad score by audiences on Rotten Tomatoes. Don\u2019t listen to those reviews, this is a pretty good movie. I thought it brought some great insight and new information to the story that was very interesting. Christian Bale was amazing as Dick Cheney. Bale won the Golden Globe this past Sunday for this role in the Best Actor Comedy/Musical category. He captured him perfectly and with the makeup he looked exactly like him. Amy Adams as Lynne Cheney was also really good. She was nominated for Best Supporting Actress and is a lock for the nominations for the Oscars. Though she probably won\u2019t win, she\u2019s my second choice. Adam McKay did very well writing and directing. His last movie, The Big Short, was also a big contender for the 2016 academy awards. He had an interesting approach to the movie giving it narration, which I\u2019ll get back to in a second, and making it very comedic with the editing style. The editing for his movies, done by Hank Corwin, is always so strange and unique. At the very beginning there were a few sentences on the screen saying how it was a true story but \u201cDick Cheney is a secretive man\u201d and those sentences were the best opening lines of a movie I\u2019ve seen in a while. There was an editing choice done halfway through the movie that I thought was hilarious. Usually a film has three acts to it, but it was more split into two big acts with three small ones within the two. That sounds confusing but it makes sense to me. The narration in the movie, done by Jesse Plemons, was good and had an interesting turn towards the end. I loved it and I think most will. The score for the film was good, as it made the shortlist for the Oscars. I loved the makeup and hairstyling, which probably will win the award. For problems I felt the split between acts was a little weird but that\u2019s because of the story since it didn\u2019t focus on him being Vice President till later. I thought it kind of slowed down more on the second half too. This isn\u2019t a big problem but the title sequence felt too late for me but not many will care about it. The movie was also a little bit long but there was a lot to get in. Overall I thought Vice was a much better film than what people said. A lot of negative reviews came from Republicans so if you fit that criteria I guess be warned if you get offended by these kinds of things. Since this was the film that scored the most Golden Globe nominations this year and you\u2019re into award winning movies, I would check this out. My Grade: B",

Bale is outstanding as Cheney and Amy Adams is equally good as his wife Lynne. McKay fills the film with good performances from Steve Carell as Donald Rumsfeld to Sam Rockwell as Bush.

On humor, it is very hard to beat McKay, weaving out the too-much-political jibber-jabber into a nail biting drama is his first and foremost job, that he makes sure he excels at. There are husbandry gags so witty and hilarious that it mocks the genre itself, when felt to divert the shady or speculative part of the plot to a big extravagant of puppet (literally!), he uses a theme of equivalency medium to communicate on layman terms.\n\nLike when Bale schemes his way up with banal theories of puppets in White House or an eerie homage to Shakespeare or a climatic first act that is nailed down to the credits. McKay's ferocious commitment and confident on his script, is what illuminates it on a much larger scale. The political climate which the film is dipped into isn't just left to inspire or create awareness for the current political climate control, but as an individual persona that Bale is cloaked of, fiddles on where to draw the margin of good or bad as a singular being.\n\nAs far as the structure is concerned, it is pretty much basics, Bale climbs his way up to the ladder by pushing off one or two and being challenged ethically before he ends up losing not only himself but things much more precious to him. The narration is not only meticulous but also funny and fresh to follow, in fact, it may resemble somewhat to Stone's Any Given Sunday, but fortunately the humorisc editing and direction tactics helps McKay stay on the safer side of the coin. Bale being hyped by the media and fans for his bizarre physical transformation clears out any speculations of his choice in our minds within first few minutes.\n\nHis depressed, overly thought out and dodgy character that he maps out on screen, has a perspective of his own. He seems more Chaney than Chaney himself. Plastering a half grin on his face and speaking with less opened mouth as much as possible, he may not be able to melt you down but he sure can ooze power to a point where you might start getting afraid of him. And the characters that writhes around him, including Carell as the sort-of-mentor role has very little do along with Rockwell as the Bush, who too is a victim of a similar infection.\n\nThe only challenging and competitive character against Bale is Adams as the backbone of his, has done an amazing work as his supporter. What the film fumbles upon is having the ability to transact from one sequence to another, there is no flow to the storytelling, no matter how hard McKay convinces you with his camera work. One of the best bit of the film is the narrator whose mysterious appearances keeps you intrigued into this one big speech. Vice should have been a general phenomenon, instead it is Bale's film, from head to toe.",

I actually saw it twice so I thought I'd give this film a shot. I really which I had skipped it. \n\nThis film is what is wrong with the country today. It is not historical or accurate at all, it is intentionally divisive. It is made by someone who clearly deeply hates Republican so much he made an intellectually dishonest movie for people filled with so much hate - which (you would have to ask their shrink) they have decided to focus on anything Republican . The premise of the film is that all Republican politicians are power hungry sociopaths - honestly I would more or less agree with that... but it makes it clear that ONLY Republican politicians are power hungry. \nThere is a scene where Carter moves into the White House and puts up solar panels, then 4 years later Reagan moves into the white house and on day 1 takes them all down. First in 1976 when Carter put them up, all the scientist were in agreement that the Earth was cooling and we were headed towards an ice age. Carter put up the solar panels because of issues with the Middle East and high gas prices... nothing to do with global warming/climate change - but the film implies that was the reason. \nAt the same point in the film, and I can't recall the exact quite from the narrator, but he say Reagan got elected because Republicans discovered a niche in going after the WHITE conservative vote. In 1980 when Reagan was running, 80% of the population was white, 11 percent black and 9 percent other races. To say that Republicans in 1980 \"discovered\" the white vote was ridiculous and intellectually dishonest. \nThen here we have a movie that is about Dick Cheney yet there are many jabs at Trump in 2019... why? Even a photo of Trump holding piles of cash. Why? The movie is about Cheney. \n\nThis movie is for people who are drinking the Kool-aid from politicians, in this case the Democrats. This movie is pure propaganda to fire up the base for 2020. This is not a historical movie. Honestly I feel sorry for anyone who loved or liked this movie. Wake up! \nI will close with repeating I am not a fan of Cheney or Bush. I'm a fan of good historical movies. This is not one.",

I know several who refuse to see Vice solely because it's about Cheney, and then there is a segment who refuse saying it's a left wing, bleeding heart liberal, (along with several other nice accolades), overblown, piece crap. Crazy thing is, it IS based on facts.  As was the case with the turmoil before and after the election of our current... president, facts are accessible to those without a blatant political agenda at all costs, and especially for those who seek it. Then, that's always the hard part; findung that small segment who steps out to verify those things they sense are fake simply by logic and/or awareness of events. That aside, this film demonstrates why I have been a long time fan of Christian Bale, his incredible ability to BE the person portrayed, as well as Brad Pitt one of the producers, whi has long championed the reasons to know the truth.

Of course, I hadn't. I had a bunch of SPAM email, lots of Trump and football hot takes on my Twitter feed, and one text from a friend replying to a question I had asked three hours prior. Obviously I am a very popular and important person. Being the polite and considerate friend that I am, I replied to her text and apologized for the slow response, explaining that I had been at the movies. When my friend asked if I liked the movie, I . . . didn't know. \n\nIt wasn't that I didn't have anything to say about Vice. I had a LOT to say about Vice (obviously, I'm writing a review about it now). There are plenty of movies that after seeing I leave the theater with a shrug, barely remembering them a few hours after the credits roll. That is definitely not Vice. The problem wasn't the movie, it was the question. Did I like it? I didn't know then and still don't exactly know now if I \"liked\" Vice. I sure as hell didn't enjoy it. It was far from a fun and pleasurable experience. I have never left a movie early but I spent most of Vice seething, pondering how much trouble I would get in if I threw my $9.00 bucket of cola at the screen and stormed out in a cloud of profanity. When I saw Spiderman: Into The Spiderverse last week, I wanted it to never end. I would have been happy to spend weeks in that beautiful animated universe, web swinging with Miles and mumbling along to songs we don't quite know the lyrics to. But during Vice? All I wanted was to get out, to get away from that miserable world where greedy, amoral, power hungry leaders can enrich themselves and their friends by lying to the American people and getting hundreds of thousands of people killed. \n\nAfter two hours and twelve minutes of seething, the credits rolled and I breathed a sigh of relief, walking out of that miserable and terrifying world right back into . . . that miserable and terrifying world. So no, friend who's name I won't post on the internet, I did not \"like\" Vice. Not at all. I lived through the Bush/Cheney administration and would strongly prefer to keep those memories where they belong: repressed. But the fact I had such a miserable time in that theater is a testament to how well made and effective Vice is. If I had enjoyed a movie about Dick Cheney, something would have been very wrong, either with the movie or with me. \n\nFive stars for making me feel something. Minus a half star for what it made me feel. F*** you Adam McKay. F*** you Dick Cheney. Now if you'll excuse me I'm going to go see Spiderverse again before I need to go the hospital.",

Note that not one single Republican in the movie was characterized as honorable except Colin Powell.  The war in Iraq was portrayed as some loose conspiracy with corporate America rather than the confusion and decision complexity that the Bush Administration faced in the fearful times after 9/11 when we were still trying to understand who the enemy was and how to fight him.  Saddam had caused a war with Iran that left 1 million people dead. He had invaded his neighbors.  He had gassed tens of thousands of his own people after the U.S. failed to control Iraq after the first war/. He was a psychopath and a bullly who like others such as HItler never stop until they are stopped.  The intelligence about his actions was crude, often second hand and confusing.  In that environment, the Bush Administration chose to invade. What if the intelligence had been correct and the U.S. filed  to invade?  What if Saddam giving $25,000 to the families of suicide bombers had resulted in massive casualties inside the U.S.? Why does Hollywood tell the same old story with the same old demonizing of their political opposition (conservatives, GOP, corporations) instead of a far more intelligent compelling story of trying to make life and death decisions in the fog of war?\nIt sure looks like a lack of creative talent and artistic film-making and political bias.

But I'll say this much; \"Vice's\" biggest drawback may be the fact that it doesn't really wish to seek an audience other than the one it'll most assuredly pocket. The movie is a bit of a political finger-wagging towards those in favor of or even ambivalent towards the figures depicted. Still, Bale's evocation is nothing short of astounding, and it is good to get some kind of take nowadays, instead of the watered down, apolitical cardboard we'd get from a more mainstream version of this material.

It works for the most part, but I will say near the last third of the film it definitely loses some of it's pacing becoming a bit of a slog. The movie stars Christian Bale in an incredible transformation as Vice President Dick Cheney. Bale embodies the character and nails his mannerisms and voice. He went all out Christian Bale on this one and gained a ton of weight as well nailing the physical look. The film goes over Cheney's beginnings from dropping out of Yale, to his start in politics working as an assistant to Donald Rumsfeld (Steve Carell), to his rise in politics and then finally as Vice President during George W. Bush's (Sam Rockwell) Presidential run. The movie definitely paints Cheney as a target the whole time and while it does have lots of facts I tried looking at it as non biased as I could and even I know it definitely changed a few things up such as conversations (which they admit during the movie no one would know what they were saying) and spicing up some events. It definitely paints Cheney as the powerhouse during his time as VP and the crazy amount of stuff that went down under that administration. It's a film that won't be for everyone, but I found it unique (I especially liked the 4th wall breaking it does several times) and I think Bale's performance alone is worth the ticket price!",

I have heard it being sold as a comedy and/or drama and/or satire. I admit up front I am not the best audience for a satire but if there was any it went over my head.\n\nThere is nothing funny about this movie that shows how our country was manipulated and is still paying the price today. While a lot of this may be new or a history lesson to anyone under 30 most of it will be familiar to anyone older.\n\nTurning to the positives the actors all play to their strengths starting with Christian Bale who disappears into Dick Cheney not only with makeup, costume, and adding 45 pounds to his frame but in how he holds himself, talks and walks. As his wife Lynne, if she was really such a strong figure in his life, the woman behind the man who directs all that he does, Amy Adams is strong and both are good enough to make it believable that they would quote Shakespeare in bed!\n\nThe only time I laughed was a very short cameo Alfred Molina has as a waiter in an upscale restaurant telling the power players the 5-6 'specials' such as Guantanamo Bay. Tyler Perry as Colin Powell is almost unrecognizable while Steve Carell as Donald Rumsfeld shows how adaptable people playing the Washington game are. Alison Pill, as the Cheney's lesbian married daughter has the full support of her father while Lily Rabe as her sister doesn't. There are many others in the cast playing famous, infamous and unknown people but the standout performance is by Sam Rockwell as George W. Bush who, in his weakness let Lynne and Dick Cheney run the country.\n\n\"Vice\", even with a stellar cast, is not worth the 132 minutes it lasts or whatever the admission price costs!\n\n(SPOILER)\n\nOh wait!!! Maybe the satire is the phony ending an hour into the movie?",

            "content": "Pretty enjoyable, very funny, but doesn't tell us anything new\n\nOstensibly a biopic of former Vice President Dick Cheney (Christian Bale), Adam McKay's Vice argues that he was actually the de facto President, with George W. Bush (Sam Rockwell) taking a back seat, particularly in the globally crucial years from 2001-2003. Much as was the case with BlacKkKlansman (2018), Vice has one eye on the here and now, using Cheney's story as a vehicle to examine the current political climate in the US. However, although there are individual moments of brilliance, the film doesn't actually have a huge amount to say.\n\nBeginning in Wyoming in 1963 as a young Cheney is arrested for drunk driving for the second time, the film then cuts to the Presidential Emergency Operations Center in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, as Cheney orders the shooting down of any suspicious commercial airliners, despite Bush not signing off on such an order. How he got from the first point to the second is the film's main focus.\n\nPresented as devoid of ideology, with a Zelig-esque ability to alter his mannerisms, McKay's Cheney has no interest in attaining power so as to influence policy or stimulate ideological change, he is obsessed only with power-for-power's sake. One telling scene sees him ask Donald Rusmfeld (Steve Carrell), \"what do we believe?\", only to be met with laughter. He's also portrayed as a mercenary; a chilling scene sees him give his daughter Liz (Lily Rabe) permission to condemn gay marriage, despite his other daughter, Mary (Alison Pill), being married to a woman.\n\nAs with The Big Short (2015), Vice is aesthetically audacious, cut by Hank Corwin in a similar manner to the \"horizontal editing\" Oliver Stone pioneered in his 90s films. For example, as Chaney attempts to manipulate Bush into agreeing to give him more power, there are intercepts of fly-fishing. In another scene, when he first learns of the Unitary Executive Theory, there is a shot of a lion bringing down a gazelle.\n\nAlso similar to The Big Short is the film's irreverent tone. A particularly sardonic scene comes about an hour in, as the film shows Cheney turning down Bush when he asks him to be his running mate in 2000. At this point, the legend explains that Cheney had chosen family over politics, and that he happily lived out his days in Wyoming. As the Cheneys gather around a family barbeque, triumphant music swells, and the closing credits start to roll, only for the movie to interrupt itself, pointing out that that's not what happened. It's a very meta technique, and one which mocks feel-good biopics. Another very funny scene sees Cheney and his wife Lynne (Amy Adams) speaking in iambic pentameter after the narrator points out, \"we can't just snap into a Shakespearean soliloquy that dramatises every feeling and emotion.\" In another scene, a waiter reads from a menu that features various forms of Cheney-endorsed torture. A hilarious mid-credit scene sees a focus group descend into chaos when a conservative calls a liberal a \"libtard\", prompting a mass brawl, whilst two young girls ignore it so as to speculate about the new Fast & the Furious film. \n\nFor all that, however, Vice isn't a patch on The Big Short, for a number of reasons. For example, whereas in The Big Short, the self-reflexive Tristram Shandy-style narrative structure worked to the film's advantage, providing a way into the complex story, here it has the exact opposite effect, oftentimes distracting from McKay's thematic concerns. \n\nThe most egregious problem is that the film fails to give any kind of psychological verisimilitude to Cheney, depicting his various deeds without offering much in terms of motivations. Is he simply an opportunist? Is he an evil megalomaniac fuelled by a deeper purpose, and if so, what purpose, and how? Could it all really have been about power? The film's Cheney is ultimately unknowable, and that makes his acts more excusable.\n\nCheney pressured the CIA to find non-existent links between Al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein so as to justify an illegal invasion of Iraq. He oversaw the public relations campaign to build popular support for the war. He encouraged the torture of terror suspects all the while denying it was torture. He was responsible for the worst strategic blunder in US history, the growth of a domestic surveillance state, the dictatorialisation of the office of the President, and the deaths of 4,000 American troops and at least 100,000 Iraqi civilians. Positing him as a man who was power-mad and little else, Vice remains always on the outside, never managing to open the door and expose his actual inner workings. The comedy and structural experimentation make it entertaining, but it tells us very little about Cheney that we didn't already know. Strip away the artifice, and you'll find it doesn't have a huge amount to say, and rather than exposing Cheney's dark soul, the film argues that he doesn't have one. And that is a far less interesting thesis.",

            "content": "December 25, 2018\n\nHospital technician: \"Dick Cheney-great American.\"\n\nDirector Adam McKay: \"Well, it's complicated.\"\n\nThis exchange took place as McKay was having a stent put in after suffering a heart attack. It was during the production of McKay's \"Vice,\" and just like the subject of his film-former Vice President Dick Cheney-McKay essentially knew when his heart attack was coming. He couldn't catch his breath and he felt queasy in his stomach. Dick Cheney felt this way often enough that he could give his family and staff members ample heads up that another attack was coming. \"Better get the car ready,\" he'd say.\n\nIt's a shame \"Vice\" itself isn't as amusing or interesting as this ironic anecdote, because I've no doubt Cheney is indeed a complicated man (what human isn't?), and any attempt to make a biopic about him would surely be a challenging yet exciting feat for any filmmaker. In fact, McKay's film opens with the subtitle, \"The following is based on a true story. Or as true as it can be given that Dick Cheney is known as one of the most secretive leaders in history. We did our f***ing best.\"\n\nUnfortunately, McKay's best isn't good enough, at least not here. He's certainly a gifted storyteller, and there are moments in \"Vice\" when you think it will break out of its shell and have the audacity to transform into something other than a typical \"political figure biopic.\" But such moments are short-lived and the movie spends most of its time being a mere manifestation of the thoughts and opinions of the liberal choir to whom McKay and his team are obviously preaching. Yes, there are some interesting tidbits peppered throughout and we leave the theater feeling as though we learned a few new things about the enigmatic Cheney, but it ultimately doesn't challenge or really play with what we already thought about him going in.\n\nThis is disappointing news to report, especially given the caliber of talent in front of and behind the camera. Christian Bale, who was so memorable in McKay's semi-overlooked (and much more compelling) \"The Big Short,\" is almost unrecognizable and uncanny in the way he looks, speaks and carries himself like the real Dick Cheney. He certainly did his homework in terms of getting Cheney's posture, mannerisms and body language down, and the film's makeup team must also be applauded for making it seem like Cheney volunteered to play himself on-screen. \n\nIt's an impressive and convincing physical recreation to be sure, but while it's one thing to nail the look of a man, it's another, more important thing to reveal the heart of him and expose his inner soul and motivations, and McKay's screenplay and storytelling strategies don't quite get the job done. \n\nThat's not to say the film lacks good intentions or that it doesn't have an interesting agenda, which are to shed some light on just how the towering, mysterious Cheney, through sheer determination, calculated conversations, and sometimes the sacrificing of his own family and health, was able to wield his command to make the office of the Vice President of the United States more than just a thankless, symbolic job. It also wants to show just how far-reaching the ramifications of Cheney's decisions were and continue to be, which many viewers, including myself, might have never considered.\n\nBut if the intentions of \"Vice\" are bold and ambitious, the means by which it carries them out are conventional by comparison. Sure, the film has a definitive attitude and dark sense of humor throughout, but overall it adheres too rigidly to the traditional biopic structure. This makes it frustrating to watch because there are a few inspired scenes that go against the grain and make us believe the film will stray from its typical path and really mold itself into something special. These moments excite us and catch us off guard, but they're also transitory, and when the film comes back down to Earth, we feel let down by its unrealized possibilities.  \n\nAppropriately, the vision I have for the way \"Vice\" operates is the same way a young Dick Cheney drives drunk in 1963, swerving off and on a country road in Wyoming, where he and his high school sweetheart, and future wife, Lynne (Amy Adams), grew up. Lynne makes it clear to Dick she'll leave him if she has to bail him out of jail a third time for drunkenness (this is after he got kicked out of Yale), and this scares Dick straight. By 1969 he's no longer swerving off the road but instead working as intern at the White House during the Nixon administration, reporting to none other than Chief of Staff Donald Rumsfeld (an over-the-top Steve Carrell, who makes Rumsfeld too much of a caricature).\n\nFrom this point on, \"Vice\" more or less continues on a straight path not unlike the one Cheney set himself on, going through the standard biopic motions of summarizing the major events and positions he held during his 40-year political and private-sector careers. An unnamed narrator (Jesse Plemons), a veteran of the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars, gives us the play by play as Cheney gets his own stint as Chief of Staff under Gerald Ford (Bill Camp); serves as Secretary of Defense under George H.W. Bush (John Hillner), who made him a key overseer of Operation Desert Storm; becomes Chairman and CEO of Halliburton, the oft-ill-though-of oil company; and eventually Vice President to George W. Bush (Sam Rockwell).\n\nThe film purports this last position only happened because Cheney demanded certain provisos be in order that would essentially make him the puppet master of the second Bush administration, virtually without any oversight, which he surreptitiously fine-tuned with the help of his legal counsel David Addington (Don McManus) and Chief of Staff Scooter Libby (Justin Kirk), not to mention the loosely defined unitary executive theory. \n\nAll of these are sequences are inherently interesting, I suppose, and they're presented and performed serviceably, but I wanted \"Vice\" to keep swerving off the road like Cheney did back in his youth, because the few times it does, it shows some real potential as a risky, compelling dramedy instead of just an adequate biography. \n\nTake, for instance, a moment about a third of the way through, when the movie pretends to be over. The credits roll and everything, and the film gives us the false hope Cheney's career ended after George H.W. Bush lost the 1992 presidential election to Bill Clinton. We figure the film might hit a stride and break in its ways to become more inventive and experimental with its presentation. The same goes for a scene featuring Alfred Molina as a waiter in an upscale D.C. restaurant, where Cheney and his cohorts order devious compromises of the U.S. Constitution off the menu without thinking twice about them (\"We'll have one of everything.\"). There's also a bizarre exchange between Dick and Lynne as they lay in bed and suddenly speak like two characters in a Shakespeare drama plotting something sinister.\n\nBut these moments prove to be just temporary gags before the film returns to its more familiar territory and continues as a straightforward account of the major headlines and left-wing conspiracy theories surrounding Cheney, including his viewing the 9/11 attacks as an \"opportunity\" to seize control of Iraq, which he jumpstarted by claiming Saddam Hussein had links to Al-Qaeda and possessed weapons of mass destruction; or deliberately leaking Valerie Plame's identity as an undercover CIA agent because her journalist husband, Joseph C. Wilson, wrote an op-ed piece stating his doubts that Iraq purchased uranium from Niger; and Cheney accidentally shooting Harry Whittington on a hunting trip. If you watched the news at all during Cheney's time in office, these events will simply ring in your head as, \"Oh yeah, I remember that.\"\n\nBy the end, \"Vice\" suggests that just about every major domestic, international, humanity crisis, social injustice, etc. issue we face today is linked, in some way, shape or form, to Cheney's past decisions and policies, from the rise of ISIS to the deaths of fleeing refugees. And while I don't deny his choices played some key role in their existence, the way the film presents them makes it feel scrambled and jarring. Our impression is that McKay has allowed himself to get carried away with his mission to expose this guy for who he is and is trying to cram everything in just so he can get his liberal point across, as if this was his only shot to do so. But this overeager strategy dilutes the film's effect and it loses focus. At the same time, we lose interest.\n\nWhat's interesting is that Bale has said he wanted to find the humanity in Cheney, to get away from the idea that he's \"all villain,\" and that even abhorrent people like him can still make wonderful company. But the film doesn't take that approach. Instead, it leans completely to the left, which is a shame, because a neutral position would have made Cheney a more interesting filmic character and demystified him as a looming political figure. And while do see some of his humanity, as when he tells his youngest daughter, Mary (Allison Pill), that \"We will accept you no matter what,\" when she tells him and Lynne she's a lesbian, the film makes it a point to show he went back on this promise when his eldest daughter, Liz (Lily Rabe), made a bid for Wyoming senator and refuses to support same-sex marriage. I realize this really happened, but the film's biased position comes across too heavily and doesn't allow enough time to show or even suggest that perhaps Cheney really struggled with his decisions. It doesn't entertain the possibility that he wasn't always so hasty and impulsive just to maintain power. Its strict point of view limits our engagement with the material.\n\nFor me, \"Vice\" ultimately accomplished too little in its attempt to tell me something new about Dick Cheney that I didn't already assume, and I've a feeling most viewers of my liberal persuasion will feel the same way, while those on the other end of the spectrum will see it as just another attack from the left. This makes us wonder what the value of the film is and has us asking, why see it? Despite McKay and his cast's valiant efforts, I can't provide a good answer. Oddly enough, after reading Cheney's autobiography, McKay thought to himself, \"This is a guy who has really done everything he can to not have a movie made about him.\" Perhaps he should have heeded that thought more and moved on to another project.",

Although I loved The Big Short and Adam McKay's dynamic filming style, I think many in the audience (including myself) were sitting, patiently waiting for the film to arrive at a point. To me, the ultimate conclusion was that Dick Cheney was an ambitious, but power-hungry and flawed person who's goals and political tendencies hurt the country in immeasurable ways. Perhaps McKay's frequent shift to the \"Unitary Executive Theory\" and dramatization of meetings with VP's counsel and soon-to-be Justice Scalia seemed to be an airing-out of McKay's grievances with conservative views about executive power and conservatism, as a whole. Given those dramatized interviews and pre-film warning label on accuracy, it almost looked like we were watching a Democratic Socialists of America political ad for 75% of the movie. However, toward the end, it seemed as though the film finally arrived at the point. Good movie but expected a little more of a serious biopic and/or assessment of Cheney's life, like The Big Short was an honest and somewhat-satirical postmortem of the 2008 financial crisis.",

            "content": "Pulling the strings.  So this is the unsung story of Dick Chaney (Christian Bale), the Vice President during the George W. Bush administration.  It tells his quiet rise to power, and how he ultimately positioned himself to be in a role that was more powerful than the President himself.  I deeply respect the work that Adam McKay is now doing; he spent the better part of his career directing Will Ferrell comedies (for better or worse), and now that he has paid his dues, he wants to tell these real life stories that lift the veil on ugliness that some would rather have forgotten.  Much like The Big Short, he has once again put together all the pieces to make a movie that is going to take home a lot of nominations and awards.  Now I went in well-aware that this may be a movie that will leave you feeling some kind of way, and it did not disappoint.  It is currently a very tense political climate in the United States, and I feel like this movie exists for all the people out there getting rose-colored glasses for the Bush administration, viewing them as the good old days because so many processes are broken right now.  Those days really shouldn't be idolized when you look at what was really going on, and that is what Vice is all about.  These are really some unflattering parts presented, and it ends up being an actor's movie; there is nothing sexy about any of these pudgy roles, but all of the actors commit and breathe a whole lot of life into the story.  Christian Bale is such an extreme actor, and while I bet it was probably a good time gaining weight for a role for a change of pace for this total transformation, he still puts in the work learning all of the mannerisms of a real life character.  Much like Frank Langella in Frost/Nixon, he doesn't look like a dead ringer, but he gets so much right that he completely becomes the person.  All of the details that you hope to get from an Oscar contender are present, and this is most definitely in the upper echelon of movies of the year.  I think that the editing is particularly great and noteworthy, and it completely makes its point, showing just how slimy this got.  The only small issue I take with this is the same that I had with The Big Short: it is sold as a comedy, but it is about a subject matter that really isn't funny.  It is pretty hysterical whenever Chaney has a heart attack, but other than that, this is a mostly serious story about a snake in the grass.  It is still something that you absolutely need to watch if you enjoy watching award contenders.",

The liberties taken with fact, legal theory and interpretation are stretched so thin that at multiple moments incorrect and blatantly biased information is not only relayed through the characters, but actually put forth in text format for the viewers.  Viewers hoping for a Big Short round two will find instead a highly colorized and thinly veiled mini-series that is propaganda in all but name (and even there draws close), with actual no-joke subliminal messaging included.  \nGreat acting, particularly from Bale and Carell, shines in this film... and was the main reason the two loudly complaining individuals in front of us did not walk out... and the makeup team deserves fifteen Oscars.  On the other hand, the usually great Amy Adams is given little to work with from the script, and many of the supporting cast barely rise beyond an SNL skit.  \nPerhaps one can forgive some of the travesty in Vice when remembering that, like Inglorious Bastards, it is not a documentary.

It's interesting because of the style employed, somewhat similar to director Adam Mckay's The Big Short. You get narration from Jesse Plemons, in a surprising role, and Naomi Watts uncredited, as the film traces Cheney's rise from college drop out to the man behind president George W Bush, who is portrayed as very un-presidential by Sam Rockwell, around the time of the 9/11 attack on New York. It doesn't have the same impact as The Big Short and isn't as tight but if the story is true (I don't follow American politics) then the man is a genius. There are some amusing scenes, a fake mid movie credits scene, and the narrations aren't bad. Performance wise, Bale has proven to be quite a shape shifter over the years and appears to have Cheney's look pretty close, it's an excellent cast including Amy Adams and Steve Carrell, and if Bush was actually like Rockwell's portrayal then you've got to wonder how he could ever be president, even as a puppet for Cheney.

            "content": "The most telling moment in \"Vice\" occurs early on.  After landing an internship in Congress and falling under the spell of Donald Rumsfeld (Steve Carell), Dick Cheney (Christian Bale) plaintively inquires of his mentor, \"... but what do we believe?\"  The implication that Cheney has no belief system of his own is jarring; that Rumsfeld's response is to laugh hysterically and slam the door in Cheney's face is even more devastating.  We are forewarned that this is a film about gaining and using power.\n\nThe film follows the ascent of Dick Cheney from his low point in 1963  - a Yale dropout who has dissolved into a drunken laborer stringing telephone wire in Wyoming.  In short order, Cheney is whipped into shape by his wife Lynne (Amy Adams).  After securing his internship, Cheney works himself into positions in the Nixon and Ford administrations.  He then serves five terms as Wyoming's single congressman (1979-1989) before becoming Secretary of Defense for George H.W. Bush (1989-1993) and eventually Vice President under George W. Bush.\n\nWhat's absent from this film is any theory, or even speculation, about what motivates Cheney and his drive for power.  By the time, Cheney has become Secretary of Defense, he has fully embraced a Hobbesian world view - all people are selfish and self-serving, best ruled by an absolute monarch (which explains his obsession with \"the unitary executive\").  But there's no real discussion about how he arrived at this perspective.  After informing the viewer in the opening credits that, because of Cheney's secretive nature, the film is filled with speculation, writer/director Adam McKay fails to address Cheney's internal motivation in any meaningful way.  That Cheney is so unapologetic for his decisions in the film's final scene makes this lack of exploration a glaring oversight.\n\n\"Vice\" is a scathing take-down of the man who brought us the war in Iraq.  McKay's further explanation of how incestuously the core characters are intertwined (Antonin Scalia, Rumsfeld's evolving roles) is illuminating.  And along the way, there are theatrical flourishes that make this movie soar.  The alternative life scenario for Cheney in the middle of film, accompanied by its own closing credits is priceless.  Jesse Plemmons (excellent in the 2015 installment of the \"Fargo\" TV series) as narrator adds exposition and acerbic commentary that provide impetus to the story.  For those who loved the rhythm and texture of \"The Big Short\" (one of McKay's earlier writer/director efforts), there are some similarly inspired digressions, although none rise to the excellence of Margot Robbie in a bubble bath, drinking champagne and explaining the financial  underpinnings of subprime mortgages.\n\nThe cast is first-rate, although many seem to have been cast primarily for their visual similarity to the person they portray.  Bale, as usual, fully immerses in his character, taking on an eerie physical similarity to Cheney and spot-on delivery of Cheney's speech pattern.  Carell's Rumsfeld is convincingly charming, profane and amoral.  Sam Rockwell (George W. Bush) is simply amazing - dynamically conveying W's impulsive, erratic, \"oh, wow!\" world view.  Tyler Perry as Colin Powell is the only truly curious choice.\n\nOne wonders about the intended audience for \"Vice.\"  Most adults have a general familiarity with Cheney.  Those who already hold W. and Cheney in disdain will simply have their views reinforced - although some of the details in this movie may cause them to foam at the mouth.  The film is so brutally unflattering that it will alienate those on the political right.  However, in a world of \"fake news\" and \"alternative facts,\" it's nice to explore characters who can be so transparently, unabashedly wrong.",

Bale and Amy Adams, as Dick's wife, Lynn Cheney, are the only actors who appear to take their roles seriously.

Several other casting decisions were made for fame appeal and are let downs, including Sam Rockwell's George W, Steve Carrell's Don Rumsfeld. For my money, most egregiously Tyler Perry as Colin Powell in the United Nations feels like his character addressing StarFleet Academy. When the lights come up, director Adam McKay's film leaves us to ponder many what-ifs. While this educational fourth wall breaking style was perfect in 2015's The Big Short (also with Bale), here it takes my eye off the subject, executive branch power,  and puts it on the director's insecurity. McKay knows that recent political history is an intellectual exercise that most would prefer to avoid in their entertainment time, and unfortunately he lets us know that he knows. The movie is a little dispiriting, not so much in execution as in saying that the emperor's movers and shakers doesn't believe in anything.  If so, what is the point?",

His previous film, the glorious The Big Short, skewered big business and finance. This one goes after Washington politics and more specifically the odious Dick Cheney, who is most famous for being Vice President in the Bush administration. Christian Bale is truly transformative as Cheney, a quite remarkable performance. We follow Cheney from his reckless days in Wyoming through to his introduction to Washington in the Nixon and Ford administrations. We also get a sense of his lifelong relationship with his devoted and strong wife Lynne (Amy Adams). This is all very well handled and we do get a sense of Cheney the man. However that sense is that Cheney was really in it for the sake of power and not much else. He seemed devoid of essential humanity. I do wish through there was more time spent on his Vice Presidency. There is a good set up on how he basically contrived to run the country and not Bush. But it all feels a little rushed and scatter shot. I do feel feel the film lacks in the editing department giving us chunks of information but maybe not cobbled together in the best possible way. It is entertaining though and also illuminating. Just felt like it could have gone from good to great.

And this is something that 'Vice' suffers from greatly. Sure, there is a strong thesis to this film that somewhat holds it all together but the individual segments often feel way too brief and unexplored to fully express the drama. \n\nAll of this being said, if I have to watch a movie that suffers from my usual biopic issues I want it to be a movie directed with Adam McKay's creative flair and a cast as good as the one assembled here. The combination of these two elements help 'Vice' overcome the biopic shortcomings and into something that I genuinely really enjoyed watching. Bale is just insanely uncanny and brilliant as Cheney and has some stunning support with Adams, Carrell, and a truly excellent Sam Rockwell next to him. \n\nIn a perfect world this cast would have been utilized for a TV series exploring Cheney's life in more detail but instead this is a highly entertaining CliffsNotes version of modern American history.",

At its climax, it attempts to slip one by the average audience member, albeit less tactfully, by flashing us with images of migrant children at our nations border and the California wildfires peppered between dramatic bombings of Iraq. Only one of those is related in any direct way to former Vice President Dick Cheney, the protagonist/antagonist of the film. This was the most outrageous moment of the film, aside from McKay momentarily assaulting us with blurry close-up shots of people's eyes, which can be attributed to his flashy style. Aside from those complaints, I quite liked the film.\n\tMcKay makes me laugh, and somehow manages to make me think more deeply about ruthless pragmatism at the same time. He also makes me think about how the most seemingly inconsequential and uninteresting bureaucracies can destroy lives; how government tyranny can permeate under our noses; how executive authority has changed over the recent decades; and how a monumental tragedy can create an existential crisis that changes the way millions of people think about the world. The most poignant of moments was in the finale, when President Bush, portrayed by Sam Rockwell, shakes his leg in anxiety as he announces our invasion of Iraq to the nation. The film then cuts to someone shaking their leg in fear with their family as the bombs begin to fall. \n\tThe acting is incredible, and Christian Bale looks uncannily similar to Dick Cheney, as he masterfully captures the mannerisms of an almost ghostly figure to people younger than 25 years old. I would wager that 95% of people my age do not even know who Dick Cheney is. They should see this movie, and I am confident they will at least be entertained, and maybe they will look up more information on who this man is. Hopefully, they will reach the same conclusions as I did; that Dick Cheney set in motion a horrific response to a horrific act. At the end of the movie, Cheney breaks the fourth wall and tells the audience his justification, without apology, for his actions. There are certainly monsters in this world, and they should be dealt with. However, there are many signs that point to Cheney being one of them.\n\tThis brings me to the central question the film poses, and this may have been unintentional, but nonetheless, it was apparent to me. At what point is pragmatism immoral, and will the inevitable progression of governmental power in the name of pragmatism eventually lead to tyranny? This film says it already has, and makes the claim it will become worse. I think both sides of our current political bareknuckle fight can agree that the endless expansion of executive authority has already damaged our reputation as a country, has caused death and destruction, and will lead to more tragedy. Even though Dick Cheney probably does care about his family more than his political dynasty and George W. Bush is certainly more than just a bumbling idiot, I think Vice poses important questions that we should all strive to answer.",

It suffers from an obvious bias from a liberal director to purposely portray the central figure, Dick Cheney, as some sort  of Darth Vader. For example, he uses dark colored backgrounds frequently when filming Cheney yet shows footage of Obama's first swearing in ceremony in bright colors with a smiling Obama. The film plays as a pseudo documentary. The only thing that is missing is Michael Moore.\n\nThe first half of the movie which depicted Cheney's early years as a young man and his subsequent marriage and struggles was very interesting. The second half when he actually becomes the VP to George W. Bush was actually kind of boring. I'm sure McKay meant for this part to be the meat of the film with the War on Iraq but I found it uninteresting and somewhat boring because we've already heard this stuff, e.g., there were no weapons of mass destruction found in Iraq, the war was unwarranted, etc. \n\nIn a Christmas movie season full of so many mediocre and bad films,  e.g.Holmes and Watson, I was hoping this would be that one gem since it had Christian Bale. But even he couldn't lift this film from mediocrity. I think with a different director it may have done better but the reality is that aside from Cheney's time  as VP during 9/11 and the Gulf War, he has lead a fairly typical life. \n\nUltimately, the movie suffers from not being an honest biopic but instead a thinly veiled anti-Republican propaganda film.",

But man, this movie really disappointed me and I can't quite put my finger on why. I think it mostly has to do with the disparate styles and cuts and flashback and fast-forwards. There were serious moments that would be punctuated by a completely out-of-place social commentary, break-the-4th-wall scene that totally took me out of the movie. I had no problem walking out of this movie twice to quickly go to the bathroom. The acting, however, was SO GOOD. With the exception of Steve Carell, who sounds like he's playing himself, Christian Bale and Amy Adams deliver tour de force performances. Alas, this was probably my biggest disappointment of the year.",

My military career spanned the Bush-Cheney Administration and Iraq war and I'm glad this movie was made and the details of their actions have been documented in this film since most people won't do the additional research as I have to know that this is spot-on. This movie is very much worth seeing and provides plenty of entertainment while informing individuals how power was abused, taxes were wasted, and many lives were impacted and will continue to be impacted for years.

Obviously scenes such as Lynne and Dick in the bedroom quoting to each other are fabricated and I thought quite funny. There is plenty of tongue-in-cheek humor. The acting is excellent and Bale should be nominated for his performance. I enjoyed the references to Roger Ailes, Alito, Rumsfeld, FOX, Norquist, Rove, etc. The movie shows a darkness inside the White House led by Cheney in a quiet but intentional way - self-driven to be in power. The movie hits on how the conservatives changed their messaging to use the phrase \u201cdeath tax\u201d to get Americans to want to get rid of the inheritance tax which in reality affected only the wealthy Americans. Also nailed the Iraq War under false pretense etc. Hit the torture issue as well. Also touched on the fact Zarkowi went back to Iraq after the war and started the Isis group. The W administration (Cheney) is responsible for ISIS. The conservatives tried to blame O for this. The director inserted a number of interesting visuals, cuts and perspectives, etc. I found the movie wildly entertaining.

He IS Cheney. Amy Adams gave a credible performance as Lynne Cheney who was as ambitious as Dick Cheney, maybe more so. The actor who played George W. Bush sounded and sometimes looked like him. It was uncanny.

The US campaign in Iraq was an unmitigated disaster - we entered the war on bogus information, were lied to about its justification had no strategy for peace and the resulting mess helped give rise to ISIS while enriched companies such as Halliburton.

I found the script, acting, editing, music all very good with plenty of entertaining twists. There's also scads of toe-curling, inside-the-Beltway villainous political machinations to make you laugh and shudder at the same time. In the end we see how Cheney's power lust, misbegotten patriotism and ultimately tragic, even sympathetic career helped greatly advance the darker side of our national actions. To envelop that in a film with humor and tell it coherently is worthy. Bale, Rockwell, Carell and Adams were all well cast. A romp, and a horror show, and a history lesson, a reminder to give a damn as a citizen and vote... and a great escape. Glad I went.",

I loved the camera work (especially the times Bale is filmed at an angle that makes him look menacing) and the editing is stellar.

I was hoping to see a smart satire about a figure that hasn't been explored. The continual wink-wink/nod-nod cheesiness combined with its arrogant self-satisfaction gets in the way of that story.

The attempt to connect Cheney to Trump with sub conscious background imagery is laughable and a cute attempt at brainwashing.

After seeing this film, I can now say that I still know nothing. The only thing this film does is make it seem that Dick Cheney is directly responsible for all the problems that have plagued the United States for the past 20 years, like the creation of ISIS. This film takes us deep into the thoughts and private conversations of Dick Cheney and paints him, and any right leaning person or organization, as either evil or power crazed and after very little research done by myself I have been able to find that many of these scenes were untrue as people who were apart of these events have spoken up about the inaccuracies of this movie. As I am looking at the past works of Adam McKay, I see mostly comedies which is no surprise to me as evident by his comical and completely disrespectful portrayal of George W. Bush, a Yale educated man, as an unintelligent man who is thought down upon by even his father. The only redeeming quality of this film was in the acting which I will say was superb, especially from Christian Bale. The thing that worries me the most about this film is that my generation will be so naive as to take all the ideas that this film tries to broadcast as factual and be brainwashed into having this skewed perception of Dick Cheney and the George W. Bush administration, which I know was far from perfect but was not the epitome of almost pure evil as this film leads one to believe.",

While the timeline can be as erratic as the behavior of the younger Mr. Cheney, and whether totally factual or not, the storyline is as spellbinding as the casts' performance.

The unique structure of the film, the way the story is laid out from start to finish, done flawlessly only the way Adam McKay can do it. Of course it is a satirical biopic from McKay, so there are plenty hilariously crafted moments. But there's also excellent drama, very informative but as with The Big Short, this script is also a lot of fun, careful not to throw information at the audience in a boring way. \n\nLet's talk about the man of the hour here, Christian Bale. Another complete transformation from him, he absolutely loses himself in this role and it's amazing to see. Everything from the hair and makeup, to the raw essence and seriousness of Dick Cheney that he perfectly captures, this is another stunning performance by Christian Bale. There's such a great task here for Bale, with the film spanning from the 1960s Nixon Administration, Cheney's career as Congressman in the 1970s, CEO of Halliburton during the Clinton Administration, into the September 11th attacks and the War on Terror. Once again, Bale chose to change his weight during principal photography to match these different eras of Dick Cheney's life, instead of using prosthetics. Amy Adams as Lynne Cheney is absolutely fantastic; the two actors share an amazing Shakespearean scene I don't want to spoil, but it is hilarious! Sam Rockwell as George W. Bush is fine, but for me, not Best Supporting Actor-worthy this time around. To my surprise, Tyler Perry as Colin Powell gave a much stronger supporting performance which really isn't being talked about. I say definitely give this one a shot, if not for the history lesson, then at least for Bale's transformation.",

He even pokes fun at this in the mid-credits scene by throwing in a gag about how Trump supporters would hate the film and having the conservative in the panel attack a liberal panelist in the focus group. I guess the director thought if he was the first to make the self-deprecating joke that everyone would just laugh it off and forget about it. \n\nThis movie reels you in to get you interested and trusting, and then tells you what you should believe in the end. When Bale (as Cheney) broke the fourth wall and addressed the audience directly about how he had to be ruthless in order to protect America, an older woman next to me in the theater said \"evil asshole\" out loud, as if Dick Cheney actually said those words.\n\nThe film mixes fact with opinion and hearsay, but presents itself as fact.

Steve Carell is especially good as Donald Rumsfeld.\n\nThe narrative is told much in the same style as McKay's The Big Short, but frankly not done as well, and tonally not really appropriate for this story. The movie shows events from Dick Cheney's life before he was VP--failing out of Yale, becoming a downwardly mobile drunk, cleaning up his act, graduating from State U, interning with Rumsfeld, working in the Nixon, then Ford White House. While interesting, McKay doesn't quite connect the dots. We don't ever really learn what makes Dick Cheney tick. We don't learn anything we didn't already know about him.\n\nI find it interesting Hollywood seems to have come to a consensus Republicans are evil, while Democrats are basically good. While I went in knowing this would be a one-sided picture (I don't really think there are two sides to Dick Cheney), I'm not sure it's fair to place all of America's current ills at Cheney's feet. So what was the point of this movie? Was it to demonstrate the dangers of allowing a cynical opportunist into the White House? (Is there an obvious parallel I'm missing here?)",

            "content": "Christian Bale has transformed MANY times for a movie--lost weight for \"The Machinist\" put it back on for \"Batman Begins\", then there is Patrick Bateman from \"American Psycho\" and of course when he played the little boy Jim in Steven Spielberg's classic \"Empire of the Sun\". The guy is an ACTOR. This is his very best role, I think. I don't think he transforms for other movies like he does for this one. And, as the picture moves on, he becomes more and more Dick Cheney, it is brilliant to watch and worth the price of the ticket just to see him do it. \nIn contrast to this \"Tour de Force\" of a performance, this is LESS a STORY and more of a DOCU-DRAMA based on LIBERAL assumptions and attacks that were all to common from the left-wing media during Bush's administration. Big on assumptions, but not on FACTS. The film even warns you of this at the very beginning \"we did our fucking best\", as though that's a consolation, be it a very heavy-handed and arrogant one. The core controlling-idea of the movie seems to be that Cheney discovered there was very little oversight over the Vice President written into US law, and so he worked around that and behind that in all ways that he could. But, the film also suggests that George Bush had literally NO ROLE in his presidency AT ALL, because it was all Cheney. This, I find too crazy to actually believe. I remember those times with every liberal shill on TV shouting \"War for oil! War for oil!\" but no one was actually allowed into Iraq to harvest any of it after the fact. And, the real facts of that war, as we can see now, both in Iraq and Afghanistan were that those wars were created to feed the bottom line of the military industrial complex. A topic the News Media has refused to investigate, and one that this film only seems to lightly, ever so gently touch upon. Companies like Boeing, Raytheon, Northrup Grumman, Kellen Brown and Root, and others made a killing. And, where are all the good liberals to uncover THAT collusion?? Oh, but Cheney is a bad guy, he did this all by himself, he had no help. Yeah. Sure. Whatever. I'm not buying it. \nI loved Adam McKay's 2015 movie \"The Big Short\", but this movie seems \"short\" on story, instead employing cutaways (which distract), dark humor (which is actually funny), and liberal propaganda (which is all too obvious) in order to sell it's grand thesis. And, it comes off exactly how McKay has come off on Television in recent years: Smug, Arrogant, Dismissive, Devoid of Relevant Facts, and Bloated. Yes, I just said he was fat, just like his movie. You can cut 30 minutes out of this screed, and it's the same \"liberal argument\" as we started out with in 2006. \nIf you are fan of Bale, watch it for his transformation. If you are expecting a good story, wait for it on Home Video. It'll be a \"Streaming\" pile of horse shit.",

More people need to know about the war criminal that is Dick Cheney. The problem with this movie is that it can\u2019t function as a proper drama and a good movie, and is at best a heavily biased documentary. The best movies in this genre are the ones that leave you thinking and reflecting, with the nuances and proper dramatic dialogue that provide an objectivity to the story and leave the audience to decide for themselves what is right and what is wrong. This movie doesn\u2019t do that. It instead talks at you for over two hours like a script derived completely from a Wikipedia article. Expository dialogue is good in small doses, but this movie uses it every five minutes, which completely takes me out of it and leaves me a bit bored. The Big Short worked so well because it could function as a drama and a captivating movie, even with scenes of expository dialogue. To make matters worse, the movie explicitly tells you how bad of a person Cheney is. Now, I personally think he is, but a movie about Hitler doesn\u2019t explicitly tell you that he was a bad person; his actions speak for themselves (he\u2019s not as bad as Hitler but you get my point). Case and point: we don\u2019t need a scene of Cheney talking to his wife from Macbeth to see the symbolism of someone corrupted by power. Worst of all, it gave me no reason to care about what was happening. It didn\u2019t inspire me and mostly just reaffirmed my belief that Cheney is a bad guy. There was a lot of potential for this movie and that\u2019s why I was so disappointed by it. I was imagining this movie being the call to action for voters everywhere, but it left me kinda bored. I\u2019ll give it a 2.5 for the acting.",

But ultimately it fails to come together as a movie or as a story at all, jumping around from anecdote to anecdote, so many cutaways it felt like a family guy episode, and then ending abruptly without seeming to have made any point one way or another. It didn\u2019t humanize or dimensionalize him or the events surrounding his life, it just regurgitates the facts in a fun way. The tone is also an issue because it will go from straight comedy to a dramatic shot of innocent civilians in Afghanistan getting blown to pieces. At the end, I\u2019m still not sure whether we are meant to be awed by Cheney\u2019s frank underwood-esque machinations or horrified by them.

Tons of people appreciate and respect this provocatively profound polemic...and I feel the current rating is not reflecting that. We know what sort of trolls, acolytes are giving this film bad ratings.\n\nThis film explores the unitary executive theory being exploited and abused more so than any other feature film in American history ( excluding documentaries). \n\nVice is didactic, intelligent, and deeply unsettling because it analyzes some hardcore truths. Christian Bales give the best performance of his career. Amy Adams also gives a masterclass sensational display of acting. The entire ensemble was impressive. Adam McKay is one of the most prolific directors of our time and I hope he receives an Oscar nomination for directing and writing. Vice has more substance and complexity than 80% of the acclaimed movies released in 2018. It would probably take numerous analytical essays for me to properly dissect the movie with adequacy. \n\nThis is an incredible film.

            "content": "Fascinating in all its inhumanity.\n\nAdam McKay's political biopic Vice (2018) is not as humorous as you might expect, but rather a damning testament to the pervasive effect Vice President Dick Cheney has had on American politics over the course of his lengthy career. Vice proposes the idea that Cheney had planned his political ascension to power long before he ever worked alongside President George W. Bush. I was initially worried that Vice might glorify or sympathize with Cheney, but McKay put my fears to rest. Vice depicts Cheney in a very clear and unflattering light as the most manipulative man to ever step foot into U.S. politics.\n\nMcKay's direction is steady for dramatic scenes, while erratic for the transitions and comedic moments. This is both riveting and keeps you on your feet while watching Vice and also got on my nerves. The direction is simultaneously impressive and annoying. The editing in particular is so interesting in how documentary footage and pictures are spliced in with the reenactments from the cast. This is very visually stimulating and kept me engaged throughout Vice as we see the consequences of Cheney's actions and choices.\n\nI do think most audiences will be confused by these editing choices as the stylistic choices can feel jarring, especially since the story is being told out of chronological order. Time skips around to get to what McKay wants you to understand about Cheney rather than just tell his life story.\n\nThe score is really beautiful and gives Vice a serious tone and a thrilling ambiance to set the mood down a dark path. The atrocities committed and ordered by Dick Cheney are set to gorgeous orchestration and that somehow fits Cheney's entire vibe aptly.\n\nChristian Bale transforms himself into the fat monster that is Dick Cheney. Bale unquestioningly imitates Cheney's vocal quality, slow speed, and biting tongue that Cheney speak with always. His mannerisms seem entirely Cheney's and not his own. Vice is a powerhouse performance of Bale becoming a loathsome man.\n\nAmy Adams is perfect as Lynne Cheney. Adams takes on her strong specific voice and powerful tone. Adams does not shy away from portraying Lynne as ambitious, callous, and tough as it seems likely that she was exactly all that and more.\n\nSteve Carell is hilarious and ghastly as Donald Rumsfeld. Sam Rockwell is hilarious and accurate as the oblivious idiotic puppet that was George W. Bush. Rockwell is great opposite Cheney in each scene, but McKay underused Rockwell certainly.\n\nOverall, Vice will be remembered for an accurate portrayal with its unorthodox style of presentation. Using Jesse Plemons as a narrator was interesting for context and perspective too. Vice is absolutely intriguing and fascinating for all its unique stylized choices. Not all work, but I found Vice riveting all the same.",

Bush (Sam Rockwell) where Cheney redefined the VP role as a defacto second president. This is the story of his 60 years shaping the annuls of political power.\n\nIf you have one reason to watch Vice, it's the staggering performance by Bale (Hostiles). As is custom, the man completely transforms himself into his subject, gaining weight, building muscle in his neck to simulate the Cheney shoulder hunch, and going unrecognizable in startling older age makeup. He doesn't just look the spitting image of Dick Cheney but he sounds like him too, exhibiting his cadences and mannerisms, and fully inhabiting the man every second he's onscreen. It's a compelling, captivating turn that ranks up there with Bale's best. He's beyond great but strangely nobody else is. Amy Adams (Arrival) plays Lynne Cheney, Dick's wife and shrewd political partner, and her worst acting moment is her introductory scene where she lays into the young Cheney. It's like an audition where the actor is hitting the wrong notes too strongly. Adams regains herself as the film carries on but never has a standout scene. Nobody else other than Bale is given the material to stand out. Rockwell (Three Billboards) and Carell (Beautiful Boy) are enjoyable and aided by impressive makeup, especially old Rumsfeld, but they're given one note to play. Their roles become more impression than performance and both men drop out of the movie for long periods of time. The next best actor might by Tyler Perry (Gone Girl) as Colin Powell, and maybe that's because Perry is used to brokering nonsense with his own array of nonsensical characters. He's already the weary adult.\n\nThe meta interludes and fourth wall breaks that helped The Big Short succeed conversely are part of the problem with Vice. Most Americans know a decent amount about the Iraq War and its documented fallout, so there's less need to have celebrities interject and explain complex scenarios and institutions (the absence of Margot Robbie in a bubble bath will always be felt). The narration by Jesse Plemons (Game Night) doesn't feel necessary, and his ordinary identity becomes a guessing game for most of the film, trying to link him with Cheney. I was thinking he would be an Iraq War soldier and get killed later on, that way establishing a stand-in for the thousands of men and women who are no longer walking this Earth as a direct result of Cheney's misguided action. Nope. When his identity is finally revealed you'll go, \"Oh,\" and that's it. Because he wasn't really a character, he was a narrative device and one that didn't stand for anything larger. The visual metaphors can also be very, very obvious. There are consistent cuts to Cheney fly-fishing in a river, meant to evoke him luring others into his desired machinations. Even the end credits feature fly-fishing imagery, in case you had forgotten about this enduring metaphor. The conclusion literally involves a heart being removed and the sequence cut along a more figurative betrayal, and you can feel McKay vigorously pointing at the screen and yelling, \"See, it's because he's heartless, get it? Do you get it?\" We get it. The documentary-style and comedic techniques that allowed The Big Short to be as entertaining and accessible, and one of the best films of 2015, are paradoxically the things that seem at odds with Vice.\n\nThe meta breaks are meant to provide a degree of comedy to the picture, which is generally absent comedy otherwise, unless you count the rise of Cheney's reign as the darkest of comedies. I suppose Cheney's nonchalant recognition of his heart attacks (he's had five) could be a potential comedic lifeline if you're being generous. One second we're told people don't speak in Shakespearean soliloquies in real life, and the next second the Cheneys are talking in Shakespearean verse. When it looks like the Cheneys will drop out of public office to spare their gay daughter Mary (Alison Pill) the inevitable storm of harassment, the movie has a fake-out end credit sequence to sum up their hypothetical lives. To demonstrate Cheney's knack for making the most ridiculous statement sound statesmen, he recommends that the Oval Office team put miniature beards on a part of their anatomy and perform an adult puppet show, which draws solemn nods of approval from the others. It's a joke that feels too glib, like the intended point is being lost by the lewd nature of the comedic aside. The only meta aspect that feels earned is the final one, where Cheney turns to the camera and directly addresses the audience, acknowledging he can feel their contempt but refuses to apologize for his actions in order to keep people safe. Because he's having the final say, because he's offering a rebuff to his movie, it feels more earned and fitting, and it would have had even more power if it were the only break in the movie rather than the last. It's hard to call this a comedy; it's more an incredulous indictment looking for its mob.\n\nI honestly think a straightforward biopic might have been the better route for Cheney. The first half of the film is more interesting and successful because it is the more illuminating half. I never knew that Lynne Cheney's father likely killed her mother. That's a pretty bold charge on behalf of the filmmakers. The early Cheney years are the moments the majority of Americans don't know about, whereas the later years have been well documented by a slew of hard-hitting documentaries, books, and journalistic exposes. There are whole movies about topics like the Valerie Plame leaking (Fair Game), the mounting mistakes after the invasion of Iraq (No End in Sight), the administration's policy on torture (Taxi to the Dark Side, Standard Operating Procedure), the drumbeat to the war and snuffing out of critical journalism (Shock and Awe, Lions for Lambs), the missing WMDs (Green Zone, Body of Lies), the Bush deferment memos (Truth), the long-term consequences for those servicemen who survive (The Hurt Locker, The Messenger, Stop-Loss, Last Flag Flying, In the Valley of Elah, American Sniper, Thank You For Your Service) and anything that Michael Moore sets his sights on. This list is not exhaustive by any means. Because of that the film seems to become a rudimentary montage once the Iraq War kicks off, sprinting through the rest as an intended tableau of hubris as Cheney's star and influence falls. I would rather have learned more about Cheney's early years in the Nixon, Ford, and H.W. Bush administrations and gleaned more personal insights into the man before he becomes this shadowy, mythic figure that seems downright Machiavellian in his control of government. It's interesting to watch Cheney and his cohorts plot their unchecked executive power behind the back of President Bush, but then what?\n\nIt's the \"then what?\" question I keep revisiting with McKay's film, trying to figure out the larger intended message, themes, and dire warnings. I feel like because of the expanse of time covered, and the meta quirks applied, that the film too often feels like it's just scratching the surface of Cheney, providing a slight gloss to a political caricature. The biggest takeaway is the slippery slope of the \"unitary executive theory,\" a term you'll hear often, that basically follows Nixon's own words: \"If the president does it, it's not illegal.\" This questionable interpretation of Article II of the Constitution gives the president powers that approach a monarch, which seems antithetical the Founders' intents. McKay warns that any president could take advantage of this theory to do whatever he or she (sad trombone noise... sigh) desires. This is clearly meant to draw a line right to President Trump, but it's not like the 45th president needs sketchy legal cover to do his misdeeds. The idea that the Justice Department memos would be a lurking danger is quaint. A bad man with power is not going to look for the rules to allow him or her to break them. The idea that a president could be above the law is also a legally specious argument and one I don't believe our courts would readily back, even with the \"unitary executive theory\" (at least I hope so). With that in mind, Vice becomes a cautionary tale about the expenditure of power but lacks the adequate follow-through.\n\nVice is a tricky biopic for a tricky subject and I wonder if it would have worked better being stripped of its prankster, meta interjections and tricks. It's a condemnation of Dick Cheney but it doesn't feel like it goes far enough if McKay's eventual thesis is that the current world problems began, or were grossly exacerbated, by the actions of Cheney. Climate change warnings going unheeded, ISIS formations going ignored, the generational consequences for unsettling the Middle East, and laying the foundation for an authoritarian strongman to be an acceptable political position for millions of Americans. These charges are clearly intended to be a denunciation of Cheney's legacy, but the end results play out somewhat differently, like a slap on the wrist. I think Dick Cheney could even watch this movie and nod in appreciation. That seems like a mistake. McKay is still a talented writer and filmmaker that knows how to keep his movie flowing and entertaining, buoyed by an outstanding performance from Bale. It's a movie with great components but seems to clumsily get in its own way with its presentation. If you're going to expose Dick Cheney as a heinous manipulator of power that has wrecked havoc for billions, then maybe you don't want to dilute your message.\n\nNate's Grade: B-",

            "content": "Adam McKay's Vice is a scatterbrain slingshot at the Vice President of Dick Cheney, tracing the ethos of its own caricatured, straw-man creation. By previously focusing on a concern for suffering, The Big Short masked McKay's lack of interest in ideological reasoning. Comparatively, Vice is motivated not by concern but by sheer hatred. Its rage-induced howl distorts its train of thought into an aimless assault on an amalgam of conservative iconography (from Reagan and Scalia to the Heritage Foundation and Fox News).\n\nRegardless of one's political position, liberalism and conservatism both come from a honorable tradition rooted in a desire to address human concerns (albeit in different ways under different preconceptions of existence). This unutterable notion (rendered as such by modern passions) is rejected in the prevailing belief that one's ideological opposite is motivated by an intrinsic desire to hurt others (as shown with the characters of Vice conversing as if harm of innocence is the first priority of their business). While malicious intent can clearly be found among those in both ideological camps, one must first understand principles before maliciousness can be identified as a differentiating exacting motivation separate from principle.\n\nMcKay's analysis of Dick Cheney cannot make that differentiation with the evidence being the hysterical laugh by Donald Rumsfeld to Dick Cheney's inquiry to their actual beliefs being uniformly associated with anyone having anything to do with conservative politics. This causes its satire to sink under its own weight while also depriving a wider audience of the needed critiques of the Bush/Cheney era iteration of conservatism and Republican Party politics. As McKay's sneering muckraking veers into speculative distortions steeped in disdain rather than hard facts, he exposes his ignorance to the conservative rebuke of the Bush/Cheney era iteration by the Trump era's populist isolationism. As such, McKay's film is a frenzied sermon to the unhinged converted who quite interestingly didn't see much to laugh about in the theater in large part due to the fact that given McKay's premises, why would this ever be a laughing matter?\n\nThe unfiltered, jittery narrative form of Vice may find some center in Christian Bale's calculated grotesquery and dramatic reprieve from Steve Carell's foolhardiness but is too loathing of its subject to understand it well enough to realize its totality. Rather than the expansive conversation that The Big Short was, Vice is the Vice Presidential companion to W. if Oliver Stone had a tenth of the creative mastery he had when similarly crafted his distorted revisionist tale JFK. In any event, always remember that McKay's emotion is the enemy of his truth.",

It is a little slower paced of a movie, but the way he frames every scene has such gusto that you can't take your eyes off the screen.\n\nOther than the brilliant script the main thing to note in this movie is the perfect casting. Christian Bale and Amy Adams teaming up again, this time as Dick and Lynne Cheney further prove they should team up in every movie together. Christian Bale is so believable as Dick Cheney that you suddenly forget that you are even watching Bale at all. Then you have Steve Carell as Donald Rumsfeld, Sam Rockwell as George W. Bush, Tyler Perry as Colin Powell, Naomi Watts, Lily Rabe, Jesse Plemons (in a role that I did NOT see coming), and plenty more.\n\nThere is a fantastic scene between Lynne and Dick where Plemons' character narrating notes - that we wouldn't know what they actually would have said in this certain moment, but he images it would be something quite Shakespearian. Then Lynne and Dick start talking like they are in Macbeth. Their chemistry is just fantastic and you get to see how much Lynne stepped up, and her ambitions and reservations with going into this political world.\n\nAs much as this movie paints Cheney as a villain, McKay still gave him depth and compassionate moments, and showing all of his health troubles. You really see how this man became the most powerful VP that we have ever had in the history of the U.S. Presidency and how scary that is because it is all true. We have lived it.\n\nThis movie is definitely not for everyone but I really enjoyed it. There is a funny after credits scene that shows how divided our country is, and the quote above is exactly what you should be asking yourself at the end of the movie. So, what do we believe?",

            "content": "Doing what is right is boring. Following the rules is boring. Doing what is wrong is entertaining. Bending and breaking the rules is amusing. Movies should not be made about politicians, but given most politicians don't do the right thing rather often and tend to break and bend the rules to fit their own needs and agenda as frequently as they see fit it is no surprise there are plenty of television shows and movies based around and on political figures. There is a brief scene in Adam McKay's latest film, Vice, based around the life of Vice President Dick Cheney where he is teaching one of his daughter's how to fish and she asks if the trick of baiting the fish with a live worm is right or wrong-you know, morally. Cheney replies that, \"It's not right or wrong, it's just fishing.\" His daughter admits to not wanting to hurt the worm, but her father summarizes his justification for the sport by stating, \"You find out what they want and you use it to catch them. The family gets to eat.\" It is with this perspective that Cheney seemed to approach his political career as well-it also exemplifies how every single line and aspect of McKay's film is integral to the portrait the writer and filmmaker is painting. \"It's not right or wrong, it's just what needs to be done.\" What McKay is really exploring through Vice though, is this idea of how does a man go on to become who he is? The film describes life as being a series of events that contain certain moments that are so delicate, that they are akin to a stack of teacups with a saucer in between each where-at any moment-one could fall in any direction and change the course of the future forever. Unfortunately, there's no way to know the future and which way things will fall, but while McKay is keen to note that Cheney more or less fell into the roles he would eventually allow to define the purpose of his life largely due to the involvement of his wife, what he seems particularly interested in dissecting is how Cheney came to view the job of serving the country and how he interpreted that responsibility as it becomes very clear that Cheney and his staff were experts at interpreting things strictly in the way they wanted and in what would benefit their cause best. What McKay is truly attempting to do is bring about a case concerning how Cheney had his hands in so many pies, either for reasons of his own agenda or for what he truly thought was best for the country (it's hard to tell from one issue to the next), and that the result of these meddling's effectively changed the course of history. McKay wants the viewer to not only read that tagline that could easily be misconstrued as a piece of hyperbole and understand it, but to grasp it and take to heart; to truly understand the ramifications of this single man's actions in determining the fate of millions upon millions of other people's lives.\n\nread the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com",

Great acting, especially by Bale. Carell is excellent. Adams is great. The score is fantastic. The structure yields many wonderful surprises. How RT critics could not pretty much all love this film is shocking. If someone said it had a 99 percent rating, I would never question it. The film contains some of the most creative and ground-breaking moments I've ever seen. I don't want to spoil anything, but just go see for yourself. I had not wanted to see this at first, but I'm glad I did. I learned so much I never knew. It's a must see for anyone interested in politics and the state of our world today.",

            "content": "Vice advertises based on a true story or trying as best as they could to pull back the veil on a notoriously private man. Dick Cheney is portrayed here with Christian Bale donning his look and assuming the clipped, monotone way of speaking. Amy Adams plays the driving force of this film as Lynn Cheney. Sam Rockwell performs his best George W. Bush impersonation.\n \nThere is a certain wonder I had about the reality of the movie's claims when you know how closed off Dick Cheney could be to the media. You will find an entertaining piece on his life and triumphs while curiously pondering whether he actually did these things. There are many claims in this film and it may be a situation where we never know. However, Bale completely becomes Cheney and ceases to be Bale in this picture. The makeup does not do justice to what he brings to the character with his mannerisms and clipped way of speaking.\n\nAmy Adams is unquestionably tied to his success as Dick seems to wander aimlessly without her anchoring him. Sam Rockwell is the perfect George W making you believe he knew the man himself to portray him so well. George W. Bush gets a reputation for being a stooge and he is portrayed as such despite evidence to the contrary. Again, the filmmakers did admit they may have taken liberties with the story.\n \nThere are many moments of brilliance sprinkled in this movie such as a Shakespearean dialogue between Dick and Lynn. This was one of the best moments I have seen in a movie showing the range of the two actors and the talent of the director to write such a scene. I had prior knowledge of this scene otherwise it would be easy to believe this was actually written by Shakespeare at one point. Other moments include visual metaphors where you may miss them if you blinked.\n \nDespite the moments of brilliance, the director can sometimes get too fascinated with his own intelligence. Sometimes, scenes are introduced which are more of a distraction than serving to enhance the story. I felt he did not appreciate the ability of the audience to pick up on the finer workings of politics and he uses creative techniques to drive it home although we already perceived what was going on.\n \nI loved a lot of his decisions and there were ideas I have never seen in a movie before but he included too many deviations in this film. I feel his previous movie was subtler in the message and had the right mix of his creative flourishes. There were times I was annoyed and wanted him to get back to the story. His creativity is impressive but needed to be reeled in some spots in the movie because they did not hit the notes he was expecting.\n\nA problem with this movie is the handling of Dick Cheney by pushing so hard on making him seem a bad man. It is true he performed a lot of heinous acts and probably a lot more actions we will never know about. There was not much balance to his story making him utterly unlikable. Not all characters have to be likable but they should also be given more balance. More focus regarding if he was good or bad would make the movie a more interesting take. My personal preference is the grey areas and the audience is allowed more freedom to decide on the morality of a character but that's my interest.\nVice is still a well made film posing more questions than it answers about a mystery of a man. The director clearly has a talent for simplifying complex subjects in innovative and entertaining ways. I looked forward to this movie given the cast and the previous effort by Adam McKay was brilliant. Where I believe he lost his way with this film was not trusting the intelligence of the audience and using the movie as more of a blunt instrument to hammer home the damage Dick Cheney had done. I was still enlightened and was thoroughly entertained watching Bale assume a devilish charm playing this oft disliked vice president. There was a lot of brilliance in this picture but the message was not as streamlined as I would like. Writing and the acting make this film worth watching and I enjoyed being challenged in a way most films shy away from.",

This film is interesting all the way through and the comedic edge it has makes it entertaining to watch. McKay utilizes the same style he used for 2015's \"The Big Short\" and for the most part, it works for this story. The actors involved all do an amazing job and Christian Bale has made the best actor race even more heated. His portrayal of Dick Cheney is riveting, unsettling, and unforgettable. The movie does choose to tell the story out of order, which at times doesn't feel necessary. I also felt the film came off as a bit one-sided here and there, but I think that is also inevitable for a film of this nature. Overall, the film is a sharply written and superbly acted political commentary that has a lot to say and is unnervingly relevant.",
