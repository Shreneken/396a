            "content": "5 years later this ends being pretty misguided but relatively harmless The plot is notoriously difficult to explain being it's based on the book by Madeleine L'Engle Director Ava Duvernay helms a large cast starring Storm Reid, Reese Witherspoon, Oprah Winfrey, Mindy Kaling, Chris Pine, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Zach Galafanakis, Michael Pena, and Rowan Blanchard in fantasy/sci-fi story of family Meg's parents are eager to explore more of the universe and traveling to other parts of it; of course her father has been doubted by everyone so he decides to venture on his own tapping into the right frequency But he ends up going missing in between dimensions trying to make his discovery after a year 3 magical witches Mrs. Which, Mrs. Whatsit, and Mrs. Who then offer to take Meg, her brother, and friend Calvin to look for him and they come across other worldly things like sentient flowers, flying leaves, and an evil entity called the IT that feeds off beings' negative energy Meg has to learn to open her mind and be more trusting to herself battling her insecurities in the process The movie is good, not great, felt very rushed and a lot of those scenes in the trailer were missing I think the biggest issue is that the book is full of more Christian themes which maybe explains why this movie was so limited and they didn't want to step on anyone's toes It does have a clear cut allegory about the evils of communism and conformity But there are some effective emotional moments, interesting visuals, some interesting concepts, and it has a great slew of actors Aside from Pine and Reid who nail their roles perfectly everyone else feels like they're in a completely different movie In order to be great it's not enough to be right, finding out all the universe's secrets cannot measure how much love we have in our hearts, we don't have to be desperate to matter in the universe This movie might still stand out as one of those trippy movies kids can look back on making them think Won't hold much for adults though for all the trippyness involved I do like the fantasy element as well as the actors but the narrative is clumsy",

Reese Witherspoon turns into a giant floating leaf. Oprah spends half the time floating around as a giant in the background. There's just a lot that doesn't make sense. Also, the CGI hurts my eyes.

The problem comes in with the conflict of camera work, atmosphere and concept design, meaning it has no clear distinction as to what it wants to be. It's filmed like a scientific drama, but tries to have a sort of magic and cosmos feel and it doesn't work because the visual lacks atmosphere and has a lot of handheld operation. To me, it feels like the director couldn't handle the weight of the project and simply tried to get the shots done in time. The hinting at technical scientific theories is weak and brushed under the carpet, even though it's for kids it still felt weak. Disney has seemed to lost their master filmmakers who were disciplined in all aspects of filmmaking. And if I have to hear the double name \"Charles-Wallace\" one more time I'll go crazy.",

I really like the special effects, I think they look terrific throughout.\n\nOnto the cast. Storm Reid does a respectable job as Meg, her performance arguably gets better as things progress - which is the opposite to the film overall. Chris Pine is underused in his role, but the casting of Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon and Mindy Kaling is good - Zach Galifianakis too. I didn't actually find Deric McCabe's character, Charles Wallace, annoying like most seemingly did.\n\nSurprised to see that this has a low rating across the board. I've never read the Madeleine L'Engle novel so perhaps that has something to do with it? I do agree the writing isn't necessarily great either.

Se que a muchas personas tal ves no les llamo la atencion pero puedo asegurarles que no pertenezco a ese grupo, la trama que posee esta pelicula es perfecta y es lo que mas amé de esta pelicula no encuentro la palabra perfecta para describir esta pelicula en un todo, pero gracias a todos los que hicieron posible esta pelicula, espero encontrar peliculas tan hermosas como esta, aunque se que como esta no habra otra. Mis sinceros agradecimientos.",

It has pretty great casting in my opinion, and had amazing visuals and a really sweet clear message at it's core. But what I don't like about this movie, though, is the fact that it seems like a bit of cash grab, ya know? Like they were a little more focused on the money aspect, and less on the actual storytelling. Like, I don't like a lot of Meg's lines, or just her general vibe throughout the movie to be honest, even though the actress portraying her had so much potential. I loved the guy playing Calvin, I think he did a great job and they brought to life a very unique vision of him, which I really loved. I just wish we had more time with him, because he kind of seems like 'just along for the ride', even though he is so much deeper in the book. The only real character development we get from him is his dad, and that one line from the It. I also really loved Charles Wallace, and he's to be honest the only main character besides the Mrs', that has no actual faults. The casting was perfect, he had good dialogue, he was likable just like he was in the book. Mr and Mrs Murray were okay, I guess, we didn't get too much time with them so they don't even matter that much. Also, I think the Veronica role was just shoved in movie to make it so they have another well-known star in there. All in all, it just seems a little lazily put together, but had SO MUCH potential. I loved their take on this universe and story, it had such a unique signature to it, but with the lazy writing and some lazy shots here and there, it kind of didn't go all of the way that it needed to. I kind of wish they did, because then we get to see how they bring the rest of the series to life, which would be really cool to see. But what can I say, it's disney.",

It had a profound effect on me. 40 years later I still can't see subdivisions without thinking about the scene from the book where they are standing on the hill on Camazotz looking down at the houses and all the houses look exactly the same. Sameness became a dirty word for me. The book made me value those things that made me different. I would guess that maybe 20% of the movie comes from the book. The rest was created, written for the movie. I wanted to love the movie. But the drastic rewriting of the story made it impossible at the end. I've watched movies that had nothing to do with the original source: Robert Downing Jr. in Sherlock for instance. It has very little to do with the Conan Doyle version of Sherlock but it's fun as heck to watch. The changes made between L'Engle's book and the movie make no sense. They weaken the story. Mrs. Whatsit would never have kicked Meg in the book, why did they have her do it in the movie? Thirty minutes into the film and I found myself hating Mrs. Whatsit. At one point in the book there is an intense struggle between Charles Wallace and a certain entity, but in the movie he just instantly yields. Why? It goes against everything that Charles Wallace was/is. Over and over the movie rewrites the book to it's own detriment. By the end I was bitterly disappointed, angry, and frustrated. Loved the actors, except maybe Charles Wallace. My advice, go read the book.",

But Duverny has no understanding of how to shoot fantasy, at first coming across awkwardly against the urban backdrop and then later in a soulless void of green screen with flat plates of actors and vistas with no grounding or relevance. Wrinkle has a stodgy  story with no relatable sense of logic; typically, although cliche, these kinds of fantasy kids films end up portraying the fantasy elements as connected to the grief or fear of the child as they grow up. This film just throws colourful nonsense at us willy billy with no explanation of the logic and no way of connecting to any of it. One imagines that if this were a 2D animated Ghibli film it would be spectacular and appropriate, but like this it ironically seems lifeless and disconnected and pointless. \nIt's twists and turns are predictable and the action is turgid. The way characters meet and the plot moves on are utterly contrived, it's disappointing really. \nIt's not a terrible film, and sometimes with the dramatic elements it can actually be quite stirring and emotional, it's just mostly a film that misses the mark in every department.",

Loneliness, heartbreak from the mother (from Meg hearing her cry every night), Who, Whatsit, and Which appeared at NIGHT - with the door flying open in the storm, not all \"glittery and sunshine and smiles\" like it's an ordinary day.  It does not have munchkins singing about the \"Yellow Brick Road\", and this looks like it is set up to be that way. The story has foreboding in every word Whatsit, Who and Which speak! The time should be spent when Meg tries to recover from the Tesseract, and the creatures has long arms, more like an octopus, not a green video game Princess that looks like a Sea Monkey you buy from the back of a comic!! Children express themselves with abandonment, not \"whispers\"!!!  UPLIFTING voices, even in fear! The director had the kids speak so monotone, it became boring very quickly! I mean, who cares about the kids before they even get to the \"village\"??? And, OPRAH - what happened to that great actress that had us in the palm of your hand when you were in the Color Purple?  Your delivery was so..... FLAT!!!!!  Who cares if you are \"looking for a man who is lost in the universe?\"  It seemed like you just wanted to go \"around the corner\" and you would find him! This is a story that can make you shudder, and feel some trepidation and fear, only to have such a showdown with \"IT\" that never materialized here! I mean, what's the matter with you, Director????  Don't YOU have the imagination and wonder and thrill of discovery that a child has???  TAKE THAT AND PUT IT OUT ON THE SCREEN!!! There should be the 'introductory scene\" of the village with the children bouncing the balls in tandem, and the permeating \"thud thud thud\" of the rhythm of the  bouncing ball, that slowly creeps into the pulsing vein in Charles Wallace's head when he and \"IT\" confront the other kids!!!!

Storm Reid, especially, is mature in her acting ability, employing finer nuances of powerful emotion in her performance. Oprah Winfrey, however, is there for name power only. She is not an actor and it shows throughout her uninspired, pandering performance. The story is, itself, inspiring and beautiful with obvious Judaeo-Christian symbolism throughout with such ideas as overcoming adversity, even evil - as well as obeying God's commands, relying upon inspiration, and turning weaknesses into strengths. Religious symbolism includes effective archetypes of the godhead and the devil, Adam & Eve, the forbidden fruit of the tree of The Knowledge of Good and Evil, the Garden of Eden and the fallen earth (I could go on) are all throughout and well used within the story. These concepts are simplified and woven into the story in a way that a full grasp of them is not necessary to appreciate the over-arching theme of good versus evil and one can enjoy the movie even if the symbolism is missed. This movie isn't polished enough to warrant a sequel. Most of the story retelling and acting is just okay - leaving the beauty solely in the hands of the over-arching story itself: which beauty, thankfuly, remains intact. A good movie to watch at home, especially with the family due to it's positive moral themes.",

Reese Witherspoon on the other hand, overacted, too loud, too much all around.  Mindy Kaling was dull also, seems I seen her on the cooking network.

The little girl was OK, but she needs to be on Disney Channel for a while get some experience before taking on a movie roll.

It reminds me of when a kid has a project and they wait to do it until the night before it’s due. This film has plot lines that come and go. There is a whole montage of like I think it was supposedly be the darkness in the world. That plot line disappears. Then there’s this bully and like there’s no real reason she doesn’t like the girl (please bare with me the film is so bad I forgot all the names) and then the rest of the movie she isn’t mentioned until the end for no reason. The CGI in this movie is so rushed I could do it in iMovie. The acting is mediocre at best (I understand they are kids but have you seen E.T). Here’s the one good part of the film. Chris Pine. Let’s get this straight, his plot line and relationships aren’t good but his beard is awesome and it seems like he’s the only person who knew how to act in the film. This is the problem. Disney doesn’t want to make anything new. They give a ton of money to new directors hoping they will make something good. This is the same with the new nutcracker and with Artemis fowl. Disney needs to get back with their creativity and make new animated movies not remakes or giving loans to make crap like this they can succeed. The only thing making them money is the properties they bought. Disney films have been going downhill but this was a cheap and dark turn for Disney.",

I don't understand why this movie is rated badly. Yeah Oprah is in it and she's terrible, but honestly I couldn't stop crying the entire film. It's extremely metaphoric and aligns with my spiritual identity exactly.  I felt connected to the idea that love is our most important emotion and the idea of finding your true self through personal strife. I think people have taken this movie literally and missed the deep underlying point. It had my daughter and me in tears because the things they handle in the film are very real for us (abandonment, obsession with work to the point of losing family, selfishness, mistrust of others, etc.) If you are Buddhist, this movie will speak to you as it did to me.

This makes sense. They are told to ask flowers where their father is. Weird, but sure, fine. The flowers say something in flower language, so Mrs. Whatsit turns into a giant flying lettuce leaf and carries the kids away. Oh, they must be going to find the father. A kid falls off and is caught by the flowers. Then they teleport to a completely different place. Wait...what? Why were we flying on the lettuce, if not to find the father? This kind of stuff happens repeatedly. Things that don't seem to drive the story forward, or they do, but we don't understand how or why.\n\nThere are parts of this movie that seem like they have to have been pulled directly from the book, because the writing is so atrocious on screen.

I'm not usually the person who complains when movies deviate from the books, as I can almost always enjoy each for their own merits. But in this case, it felt like they took the bare bones of the book and turned it into a falsely bright and goody-goody story that simply didn't do justice to the original in any fashion. Also, I'm a fan of diversity. I usually don't mind at all when directors take liberties with the source material in order to offer diverse characters. But this was...overkill. It felt like someone (the director? Disney?) was trying to make a point of checking as many cultural/ethnic boxes as possible, even changing Charles Wallace to an adopted child in order to (it felt to me) include yet another diverse character. Don't get me wrong, the little boy who played Charles Wallace was brilliant. But on top of everything else, it just felt contrived. Overall, the movie was far too floofy and sugary, like the director was afraid the source story wasn't good enough or wouldn't be appealing enough to kids and adults (never mind it's been an award-winning, bestselling classic for decades). So it had to be prettied up and made to appear visually bright and colorful and magical, like the inside of a candy store. For me...it fell flat and I came away from it thinking it was one of the worst movies I've seen in a good long time. And I think I would have felt that way even if I had never read the book.",

            "content": "SPOILERS BELOW. \n\nI didn't love the old movie as much as the book and this new remake wasn't what I wanted in a movie about this book either but I understand why they did what they did. \n\nFirst of all THERE ARE SPOILERS here so don't read from here on out if u want to watch it fresh with no spoilers and want surprises. If u I ant to want it and get angry, read the book. Wait a week. Read it again. Refer to the book often to fact check before watching it so you have it all in your head. And honestly I think he first movie was worse in comparison to the new one so if u really want to enjoy this one, watch them both so you will like Disney's new one more. Continuing on now. \n\nThe book was amazing. I've read it perhaps six times in thirty years and don't remember but I may have done a report on it once and probably discussed the book often with other readers and peers so keep it in mind during my review. Also I have read all the books and have about decent memory if not total understandIng of the series as well so some things missing irritate me. That's a big problem I have with the new movie as well that colors my perspective. I also have a strong belief in keeping true to the original book and series when making a movie and can see reasoning as to why things were cut for production and time reasons but I don't like them and this also colors my perspective. But I will try to be fair. Here goes. \n\nSo a lot was cut out or barely mentioned from the book in the new movie. The Jenkins arc was barely referenced and and not touched upon at all. That sucks. Time was probably the main reason, and that goes for a lot of my gripes. \n\nThe movie had hardly no impact or reference for this being a battle for Charles Wallace's \"soul\" or being forced to conform to society or remain an individual. Time again probably and maybe it was too deep for a Disney movie. Disney probably didn't want the artraction of meg and Calvin as a focal point due to their ages I'd guess. I dont think Charles Wallace was adopted in the book, but it made some sense for the tension of the IT controlled kid to play into his attitude to the Dad. I'll attribute that to creative license I guess. But I think it also lessens the love of meg to Charles Wallace and that isn't my feelings of an adopted kid being loved less or anything, certainly not according to my believes or anything in my life, I'm just assuming it wasn't done to help explain the dialogue used in the movie. Opinion only as I said. \n\nI don't remember the dog being in any scenes but my kid said it was there somewhere so it probably wasn't but had no impact on me watching it and so time probably was the reason as we'll as the big boy being integral so there u go. Think it wasn't called fortinbras in the book and I vaguely remember hearing someone say FORT early on so okay whatever. Calvin's one or two lines about his home life in response to meg talking about why who used Calvin know about not being accepted everywhere and maybe he was only looked at as a jock to me felt overlooked and mentioned briefly as a nod to what was actually pretty important to his character background and thus making him more important to being in the film at all. Without that backstory or such I just saw him as being hungry a couple times and pretty useless in the movie except to play as a foil to meg in showing they shouldn't stay and conform on the planet with the mustached guy. Sigh. May as well have taken him completely ouT of the film without all that. Like they basically did with Jenkins. Jenkins is super important in my opinion to the story as his arc with meg and Charles giving them backstory and how they don't really fit in at school but it was all basically cut.  Time probably was the reason and they chose to focus on the rescue. \n\nI thought Charles was basically a recluse and mute at school in the book. Don't remember him going off like the movie had him do. I'll give it to them because it made him more attractive on screen as a good little brother and defensive of his family which made his turn against his dad when the it controlled him more impactful on the screen so I get it even though i like the book setup much more. And the teachers knowing Charles was gifted I thought was important to tell the audience in the movie since they cut out all the family interaction really so o understand it if not agree with the choice. \n\nI don't remember seeing the twins at all. Which in addition to all the stuff that was cut from the movie that was in the book makes me strongly believe that they have absolutely no plans on doing the other books as movies. They are sort of inportant in other books, and what interactions and dialogue that wasn't in the movie about a lot of these things make doing the sequels harder without laying the groundwork now. I really think that they should have committed more and done this as a multipart miniseries of maybe five or six hours and done it to scale and really fleshed out the entire book. If Disney got the rights just to make money on a single movie and ignore the rest, then all the cuts make sense. So in my jaded opinion they did this as a money grab and edited it down to what was integral in their timeframe and ignored the rest or made just passing reference to parts that the book used to help tell the entire story. I truly believe they just wanted to make money on a single movie and cut way too much. As a whole the book should really be told in its entirety. \n\nThe special effects were good. Disney I think threw too much music into the score and at times it needed to be lower in volume so the dialogue was more distinct. In some cases the inpactfulness of a scene and the essential dialogue and acting was reduced by loud music and scoring. \n\nThe story was really dumbed down for the audience, and maybe that is because it was aimed at kids and not people who know the book. He wanted to entertain and not have kids ask parents questions during the film. I'm guessing that in that vein they accomplished their goal and that wasn't meant to insult any kids or their intelligence. I feel that the book was aimed at perhaps a sixteen year old kid up to an adult in their twenties. This movie I feel was aimed at kids from ten to sixteen and if they are on the younger side obviously to be watched with their parents. Purely an opinion. I haven't any idea on how bright kids are now or what their level of understanding is. I'm going by ages of kids from my era. I am about forty years old to give you a reference point. Again, no insult intended to anyone's intelligence level is intended. I am guessing. And obviously this is a Disney movie I assume is aimed at a younger demographic. I feel they only just barely touched on meg and her faults and acceptance or embracing of such and honestly the focus of her love for (or of if u prefer) Charles Wallace was obviously there but not as impactful as in the book. Either by design or not I am not sure. It didn't seem like the major focal point or epiphany as the book intended in my opinion, because I'd think that Disney would beat you over the head with it in a movie. I appreciated it not being in a way that obviously pandered to me, but it did seem underwhelming in comparison to the book. And I don't know if I like their choice or not. \n\nIf I'm remembering correctly, meg was at l set at one point in the book \"lost\" or being taken over by the IT and she needed to be brought back into \"herself\" for lack of a better term.  All I can find in the movie that is sort of like this is when her dad is trying to bring her back or wake her up whatever the hell was going on there. As I recall in the book, she needed to recite chemistry or math problems or something GROUNDED IN SCIENCE and her brain and memory and knowledge to recover her being. That didn't happen here. Her dad basically just called her name and shook her or something and she was back. Then he was going to leave her again (after saying minutes earlier I'd never leave you and then said he never meant to be gone so long but that has nothing to do with his original choice to actually leave her and now he's doing it again which i chuckled at after pausing the movie to point this out to my family as we were all watching it together and after thinking about it since then has made me angrier at the illogic and poor wording.). Well, the only thing close to the recovery of megs core being from the book is ironically how the IT got control of Charles Wallace in the movie. Reciting the two times table. Which is mathematics. Which in the book is a major part of what makes meg a standout if not as a student but an intelligent girl. It sort of fits the narrative the movie shows as an obvious logical pattern. The bouncing balls the kids do in the driveways and the houses and identical mothers speaking in unison. I get it. Anyone watching the movie has figured out this obvious connection. So maybe I'm not remembering the book perfectly because I was sure meg was amazing at math and reciting facts about such was how she was recovered in the book. Maybe it was chemistry which is basically just math in the number of electrons to join elements together or maybe it was her calculating pi or an equation which is not repeating or something that would stand out as a pattern but I'm pretty sure math was involved as a few of the questions either Calvin or her dad or Charles Wallace used to bring her back. And I think it happened twice actually. But the movie didn't use anything to bring her back. That pissed me off. \n\nNow I am almost CERTAIN there was not even a mention of a farandolae (excuse the spelling if it's off) with a name that had to bury or root itself and grow or something and it was actually inside Charles Wallace and it was the one deciding factor that would determine if he was going to go good or bad, conform or stay individual, etc. He had a name too. Now it HAS BEEN several years since I read any of the books at all so I'm going off a memory of at least a dozen years here. Maybe I'm wrong and this is from a later book. But I am pretty sure it's from WRINKLE and it was a major part of the story.  Why was this cut?  Time?  Didn't want to scare or confuse kids?  Keep focus of movie on rescuing Dad?  Too deep into science or sci-fi?  Any or all. Whatever the reason, I feel this was a tremendous loss. Didn't Megan's love of the farandolae youngster rescue him and help him root and win the battle and he helped them later?  This whole adventure near the end seemed to take place on a planet. I thought the \"planet\" was a short stay like a weigh station to rest up and return to the battle later when they met up with the witches again and then the entire time after was inside Charles Wallace. Was the dad inside Charles Wallace?  Not sure I remember if they rescued their dad from inside him or what in the book, but they did seem to simplify all this to not confuse the audience (I still believe it's mainly aimed at kids anyway) and removed even more science from this story. \n\nThere's more I didn't like. I truly hated a great deal of things in the film that were either changed, dumbed down, barely referenced, or missing completely that were in the book. And this stuff happens. I get that doing this movie in full like the book would probably take twice as long. I get it. Maybe even five hours. People won't sit for that in a theater. And probably not kids. Got u. Disney HAS A NETWORK.  Maybe multiple ones I don't know. Channels. They could easily have shot this into five or so hours and cut it up into a miniseries. Show it an hour a day for five days. Or three episodes of two apiece I dunno. They could have done this I mean they have the distribution and can release a two disc set for sale as well as showing it over a couple days and advertise  it I mean they have the money airtime network distribution...they have the means. Why sacrifice so much to throw out another two hour movie and cut so much and adapt it for such a different audience???\n\nIt is an injustice to those of us that wanted to see the book fleshed out and done fully. I think they cut way too much story, arcs, and dumbed it down for a different target demographic than what the book was originally intended. For a two hour fantasy movie, I guess it was okay. They made money. I think lots of it. But this wasn't what I could or should have been and they left a lot more money on the table for future use. The other books. A longer movie replacing this also fills more airtime and builds the watching audience up begging for more. Sequels on the other books. And they could ALWAYS cut down the original long version I'd have preferred and adapted it into this film or even reshot it. Hell they could have animated this into a cartoon later or done it with the ducks like they did with the old Christmas special or even the (non-Disney) chipmunks go to the movies series they used to adapt famous movies. \n\nThere were several options to utilize with their VAST RESOURCES that would have been superior to this movie version and they could have banked on what I listed above as spinoffs or the like AFTER doing this film. Which I'm sure they won't do. I assume they own the rights now to the book and likely the series. Why not start off with a long true to story version that's longer and uses everything in the first book and leaving the seeds for the others later down the line?  Like I said they could edit and shorten it to make a second version close to what they made, and even gone animated even for it. As is, they made a movie that is based on a good book and honestly in my opinion this was a one and done with absolutely no thought to the rest of the books. It's not as deep as the book, it's in my opinion dumbed down and devoid of the science and math and several plot points and story arcs that are needed for later, and all I see is a very base version of what could have been excellent. \n\nI described this movie to my family before we watched it to  never ending story, narnia (which I never read or saw,) with some science and sci-fi aspects like sliders and star trek. I was just throwing things out that they were familiar with to give an idea mind you. That's not what we watched. This was devoid of science, plot points and story arcs, the characters were much less deep with less background and detail, and it was to me honestly aimed at young children.  There was nothing really that parents and kids could sit down with and explain afterwards or even during, certainly nothing to prompt multiple viewings to take specific note of dialogue to look deeper into the characters, and t was almost totally based on the power of love as well as accepting ones faults and loving yourself despite them. Not because of them. Not because your faults make u unique and working towards betting yourself because now you know what they are, which honestly is where I figured they would end up like an old afternoon special tv show on the weekends on abc which I think Disney owns that channel anyway, but it's a block of a couple hours that doesn't make one think nearly as much as the book and is missing way too much. \n\nThis is an opinion. I don't proclaim to be a master of knowing everything about all the books or even the one book this was based on. I admit I haven't read them in years. I haven't watched the original movie in years. My memory is not perfect. And again, I don't mean to criticize anyone that enjoyed this version, the prior one, nor the books. I don't mean to come across as condescending or insulting younger viewers when I say this was aimed at a younger demographic of kids or that it was dumbed down. It was fine. It was entertaining. The special effects were good and the dialogue from what I remember had important lines I think were unchanged or slightly perhaps, and maybe some was completely new or out of order or context, whatever. This is solely my opinion. And it was a good movie. I just think it wasn't aimed at the same group of people the book was, the movie was missing a lot of stuff that I as a child and also now as an adult kept me guessing, forced me to think more, and want to read the other books. This movie was less than the book, and I don't want to rewatch it to find more clues I may have missed and I certainly don't want to learn about science after watching it because it was much more about fantasy and not science or sci-fi. It was fine. I think it could have been awesome. Whatever was added to the production by visually watching it was hampered by what I could not find in the movie that was in the book. And I truly feel they wasted future opportunities by removing so much. And I understand that they had to fit it into a movie and cut things. But...did they have to really?  It probably did well and made money. Maybe a true to book version while much longer may not have done as welll. Probably not. But adults like me who read even only that book were not satisfied and wanted more. They could shorten it later and edit another version like this one. Animate it. Put the long one on tv as a miniseries or something and if not shorten it for theatrical release then reshoot it and use the long version to promote it in theaters or on dvd. \n\nNever ending story was superior as a film for theaters in my opinion. Forget the story aspect...that's subjective...but the  defects even for the time in my opinion were great and both films sort of were told the same way and ended the same way generally speaking. Feel good at the end. Both were fantasy and not about science. The book had more science, and many more things as I said before that were not in the movie. Was there a neverendinn story book before the film?  Maybe. I don't know. Really I don't. If there was maybe the same sort of cuts were made there. But if know there were two sequels of movies to it and if there were three books or more written before the film maybe some people said the same things then. If so then maybe the two sequel movies have nothing to do with the original books of ther was a series written prior. But I do know that this new movie left no reason for me to wait for another film. There were no hints or seeds left to entice me. \n\nMy kids saw never ending story less than a year ago.  Loved it. I said there was a sequel. They demanded I go get it. I said there were actually three altogether. We got them all and watched them as a marathon. Y s we saw the original and then the next two straight through despite seeIf the first the day before.  \n\nWe just watched the new wrinkle movie last night. Liked it. I said I think there's an older version of it and maybe they'll do a sequel. They didn't care. And I agree. There's nothing making us want to see what's next. What did they not touch on. We all feel like we saw it all. So a two hour movie. I spent about half an hour explaining what else should have been in there, since I read the book. They are fighting over who gets to read it first. I found my original copy from I think sixth grade or so. Now two of them are reading my two copies. And the others are having them all read it together, ON THEIR OWN AS SIBLINGS AND THEIR FRIENDS ARE OVER TO NOW SPEND ANOTHER NIGHT HERE not watching tv or movi s or computer or on phones or whatever. They are reading two books, one of which is my copy from like 1990 or something. And they keep coming up to me to ask me science stuff like is a farandolae real in science. Believe it or not they didn't run to their phone and google it. I started writing this post two hours ago in between making dinner and they have been running in here to ask me stuff about the book since. They did rewatch the movie just before because I have to return it to Redbox in a few hours. They are much more enthusiastic in their reading and questions than watching the movie. The second viewing earlier today they kept pausing to ask me things I had mentioned happened in the book last night. So this last one took almost an extra hour. They are two boys at six and seven, and six girls from five to sixteen. The older ones are reading aloud in turns. One is pouring through the second copy and Is now rereading it cause she is sure she missed something. Like I did years ago. Bless them. \n\nI whispered to the oldest that there are three (I think) after this one. Wind in the door and swiftly tilting planet, I forget the other. I do have a copy of each. She's demanding to see them now. I said u have to finish for the little ones first. Now the twenty year old girl had come home for a few days wondering why all these kids are reading. I just told her it's a wrinkle in time. She smiled and said I remember u let me read that a few years ago it was awesome. I said yeah they saw the new movie last night and now again today. She asked if  T was better than the old movie version I said yeah but the book is better. She is on her way to renew the redbox or return and redo it for another day but only reluctantly cause I said yeah I'll let let them read the sequels later. A twenty year old young woman in college studying animation and art. Her eyes went wide and she ran to my office and found the other titles and took them with her to renew the Redbox. She doesn't want the kids to ruin them or read them first. And she can bang out maybe 400 pages in six hours but I did mention that if u remember honey this is the book that makes u hunt back and figure stuff out u missed. Well at l art for me and for her then. She smirked and said yeah but I'll redo the movie watch it and then start the second book. She has to look up which is next I don't remember. But she is going to finish number two and then be on three when the young ones start 2. \n\nNow I have to point out here I didn't think they'd all stay interested. And they're are bathroom breaks and snacks and dinner and such going on here. But far as I can tell they watched last night. We talked about it hat was missing. They rewatched the movie. Honestly they don't care about the first movie even though I have it on vhs. Yeah. VHS. And they are about id guess fifty pages from finishing wrinkle the book. This has been about seven hours straight now of ALL KIDS and they aren't alll mine mind u sleepover and such staying with a wrinkle in time. And now the other kid just finished rereading it and wants the next which te daughter has renewing the Redbox. Uh oh. Well keeping this many kids caring about this on their own for so long is ridiculous. Just saying. Hey maybe a longer movie with ALL THE STUFF from the original book would HAVE MADE MORE SENSE. \n\nSorry this turned into such a long post. It started out with me wanting a longer better film. In the meantime as I started this turned into everyone in the house loving what the original story is. And I guess I'm not alone as in the hours since I started typing this everyone here won't let it go. And it isn't the movie. Thanks",

Worst of all the source material was mutilated beyond recognition. I sincerely apologize to the late Madeleine L'engle because I know disney won't although they really should. All I can say is that everyone involved in this movie should hang their heads in shame and subsequently resign from ever being near another movie.  disney should stay far away from subject matter that involves brain activity and just stick to their usual mass marketing paint by numbers mind numbing crap like another 5000 marvel and star wars films.

            "content": "Just... ugh.\n\nI tried to watch this movie and judge it on its own merits rather than compare it to the book I read dozens and dozens of times as a child.  To be fair, it's utterly visually stunning, which is what earned it the additional half star in this review.  But beyond that, it's an overblown yet weak plot line.  Problems that didn't need to exist in the first place are given intense focus only to have a simplistic solution.  Meg's (Storm Reid) awkwardness is forced and never really fleshed out beyond some mean girls teasing her about her father being gone.  The scene where the kids get to Camazotz and are told \"don't let anything split you up\", but then Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe) is immediately separated from them is a giant, gaping plot contradiction.  I know this movie was lauded for casting women of color in the leading roles, but in this venue it loses the impact it could have made.  And the final message of \"no Meg, it was all about you\" is trite and disjointed, suitable for something other than a story witih a science fiction core.\n\nNow, to compare it to the book, it failied.  Miserably and utterly failed.  To start, the setting is completely off.  This is supposed to take place in a small town in New England where gossip and narrow-mindedness reign supreme, not the suburbs of Los Angeles.  Reese Witherspoon's portrayal of Mrs. Whatsit is completely WRONG.  She is critical and harsh where in the book, Mrs. Whatsit is loving, kind, and sweet.  I would have rather seen Witherspoon switch places with Winfrey, since Mrs. Which is supposed to be the harsh, cold one of the trio.  In the book, Camazotz is all about conformity.  The scene of the children with the balls is (mostly) correct, but from there they go into a faceless city and then enter Central central.  The beach scene just indicates to me that Ava DuVernay didn't understand the nature of Camazotz, or the natures of either the man with the red eyes OR Charles Wallace.  What's even more unfortunate is that Calvin (Levi Miller) is brought along for \"his diplomacy\" which the movie then never even attempts to use.  That's not even mentioning how badly his character has been watered down.  In the books, Calvin is beaten *because* he gets high grades and is incredibly intelligent, far more so than his half-dozen brothers and sisters.  He comes across Meg and Charles Wallace as he's trying to escape a household full of anger and stress.  This movie turns him into nothing more than just another kid with an overbearing, authoritative father yelling at him for getting \"ok\" grades.  And in the book, Meg doesn't just throw a ball at another girl, she punches the nose of a boy twice her size.  To me, that would have been much more empowering and indicative of standing up to a bully.\n\nI don't expect any movie to be a true representation of the book.  The only one I've found that came close was \"The Shawshank Redemption\".  But this was nothing more than some fanciful excuse to use big names in a lot of CGI while only maybe touching base with the book now and then.  There have got to be scores of other pre-teen books they could have used, they didn't have to ruin one of my childhood favorites.",

            "content": "- A Wrinkle in Time sparkles with fresh life and girl power -\n\nTime for another full disclosure: I've been worried about whether A Wrinkle in Time was going to be good.\n\nAll the ingredients were right. I'm a sold-out fangirl for director Ava DuVernay (Selma, 13TH). I adore that finally, FINALLY a major fantasy novel adaptation stars people of color. And of course, I always get jazzed about a new book-to-movie adventure!\n\nBut there was much to make me nervous. As much as I love Ava, she'd never made a kids movie before. Disney has quite the reputation for throwing money at big, splashy, colorful projects that turn out to be empty and frankly headache-inducing. Not to mention it's hard to turn a beloved book into a movie that everyone actually thinks is good!\n\nSo I got my ticket and tried to measure my expectations.\n\nAnd you know? A Wrinkle in Time is weird. It's surprising. Some scenes are big and splashy, and some are shockingly intimate. Right now it's actually scoring pretty low on review sites like IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes. But screw those guys. I liked it.\n\nFrom the moment that Mrs. Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon, Home Again), garbed beautifully in stolen bedsheets, flashed her eyes, proclaimed \"Wild nights are my glory!\" and ran into the stormy evening, I was sold.\n\nA quick recap for the new kids: A Wrinkle in Time is a kids book written in the 1950's about a girl named Meg Murray, her family, and the neighbor boy Calvin. It's a great romp about dimensions colliding in a fight for good and evil. The kids must team up with new supernatural friends to traverse galaxies and rescue Meg's father, a great scientist, who has been trapped by an evil power. It nearly didn't get published because it was so odd - and I love that the movie carries that same spirit.\n\nIt's humorous and self-aware at unexpected moments. The brother-sister team played by Storm Reid (12 Years a Slave) as Meg and Deric McCabe (Stephanie) as Charles Wallace are so charming and fresh, but more complex than your average kid characters. The grand, celestial beings called \"The Mrs.'s\" - played by Witherspoon, Mindy Kaling (Why Not Me?), and Oprah Winfrey (The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks) aren't just powerful and majestic. They are quirky, funny, and irreverent (just like they are in the boooooook!).\n\nIn fact, the movie goes for interesting, gutsy contradictions. I'm not used to the sight of warriors dressed in avant garde gowns and glittery makeup. I don't typically find movies where the hero discovers victory in her faults, instead of her strengths. And I certainly don't often watch kids stories where parents and their children square up so openly and brazenly about their vulnerabilities and hurts.\n\nTruthfully, this movie would never have been created in another era. For the first time, a Black woman stands at the helm of a $100+ million live-action project. And as she always does, Ms. DuVernay \"demand[ed] inclusiveness,\" according to Witherspoon, leading to diversity in both the cast and the crew.\n\nToday is a day to be excited as movies led by Black women become runaway box-office hits. 2018 is a year to be proud of the slow fade of girl-characters in movies who look to their male companions and ask (wide eyed) \"What do we do now?\" Not Meg. And not in Ava's movies.\n\nA Wrinkle in Time does have its weak points, for sure. Some melodrama can definitely be found coming from certain corners. Jennifer Lee (Frozen) and Jeff Stockwell's (Bridge to Terabithia) script, while strong in parts, sometimes fumbles. And, in the way of adaptations, the movie does sacrifice some important content from the book. But oh, Ava is so loving with her camera. The way she shoots her beloved cast takes the movie a step above what the script alone could have done.\n\nThere's no doubt that the people who made A Wrinkle in Time had a deep tenderness for their project, and for the novel itself. So many lines and homages are straight from the book, and watching it actually gave me the same feeling I got from reading it. The same kind of laughs and squirms, the same magical, empowering goodness.\n\nTake your kid, your buddy, your mom, or even just yourself to see this movie. Because this is one kids movie truly made with enough heart, wonder, and delight to rise above its faults. Just like Meg.\n\n----------\n\nThis review was first published on Narrative Muse, http://www.narrativemuse.co/movies/a-wrinkle-in-time, and was written by Debbie Holloway.

Unfortunately the story is disjointed and leaves too much unexplained, and Reese Witherspoon's sickeningly sweet Miss What'sit comes across as so insincere, you start to wonder if she is on the evil side. With it's commentary on social norms, violence, and religion this is hardly a family flick. Extremely disturbing visuals and emotionally traumatic dialogue make this film that was advertised as a family fun adventure fall extremely flat in my personal opinion. To summarize I've rarely watched a family film with a great cast and been left feeling this gross. I gave one star for Chris Pine in his role as the father, he was brilliant as always the rest of the actors were victims of bad script. Spare yourselves.",

Her scientist father (Chris Pine) has been missing for some time, and three mysterious beings appear to assist her in traveling through time and space to recover him.  Now I know how dearly some people hold this book to their hearts.  I am not in that camp because I've never read it.  Maybe I chose something else off of the required summer reading list, or maybe I was just sick that week.  The one thing I did hear people say about this is that it is unfilmable.  This obviously didn't stop Disney from trying... twice.  I am of the mindset that not everything calls for a cinematic interpretation, and even without reading the book, I think this would have been far better off left on the page.  Now given that I do keep my ear to the ground about movies that get released, I was naturally prepared for this to be a train wreck.  I never want to have a bad time with a movie, so I tried to approach this with an open mind.  It was very apparent very early on that everything about this falls flat, and I am struggling to come up with nice things to say about A Wrinkle in Time.  This is a story that is supposed to fill you with wonder.  That never once happens here, and it just ends up being bland fantasy.  The script is pretty weak all things considered, and I had an awfully difficult time giving this my undivided attention at home where I could be making a better use of my time.  None of the actors are ever able to sell it despite earnest efforts, and this has everything to do with the story requiring the child actors do most of the heavy lifting.  I think Storm Reid does have potential, and she is certainly leaps and bounds above the other two lead kids, but she can only do so much with her limited experience.  There is nothing about this movie that gels together with cohesion.  The science behind it all seems to work or not work depending on when the script calls for it, and it really just ends up being an adult looking at children saying, \"that will/won't work right now\".  When that is the forward movement of the story, you can just poke holes in every contrived plot point.  Whenever I started to get into this, I got yanked back out by some pop song that they are trying to sell, and A Wrinkle in Time is as botched as advertised.",

This  movie is so far from how I envisioned the story from reading the book when it first came out - yeah, I'm that old. \n\nMaybe how you picture \"A Wrinkle in Time\" depends on how old you were when you read it, and when. \n\nThis was a book of its time. Even being 8 years old, I knew that part of the shadow of darkness was communism. We had civil defense drills and a missile crises, and we all KNEW that the worst evil we could think of was having the US turn into a Soviet state. Or be like East Germany. Or China. Or Cuba.\n\n No freedom of thought or action, a \"big brother\" (IT) overseeing all of us all the time, and having to comply and conform totally. And no religion allowed (we were told to bury our Bibles to hide them). So that was Camozotz for me - a world like our own - not a magic planet with tornadoes and folding-up houses - that had given in to the darkness of totalitarianism. Where you couldn't be different - have faults like Meg - or love your family - or worship a higher being. It was a scary time - could there be a Mrs. Who or Which or Whatsit to help keep away the darkness? I actually pictured part of the book in black and white - that was what television was, right? - and re-read the book again when a few years later I saw Richard Burton's movie (black & white) of \"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\". East Berlin = death and darkness.\n\nSo....what to make of the recent \"A Wrinkle in Time\" movie? It's sure pretty - and the message to be yourself and appreciate what you are because you're wonderfully unique - can't hurt. But the movie's just too bright and bouncy and fluffy - like cotton candy. The Mrs.s? In our world they were ugly witch stereotypes (to contrast to their latter gloriousness) - and you had to battle HARD and maybe suffer to fight the darkness - and it was Meg's offering of unconditional love for Charles Wallace - as awful as he was - that saved them -NOT Meg concentrating on how much she was loved - though the statement that Mrs. Whatsit didn't love her was IT's mistake. \n\nFor me, this movie ISN'T \"A Wrinkle in Time\" - it's a feel-good, positive message to kids movie, and an opportunity to travel the universe with some dang beautiful ladies.",

I didn’t see Oprah as Mrs. Which I saw her as Oprah Winfrey who decided to play dress up.) 2. The jokes in the movie were cringe worthy.

Like give me some space to see the surroundings.) 5. Why is the camera shaking and it’s not a sinister scene??? 6. The CGI was over 9,000!!! (The CGI overpowered the whole movie.) Now let’s list all the good things in A Wrinkle In Time 1. That sandwich in Kamizats looked good. (that’s why I put at least a half star on this movie.)

It's clear that 10 times more effort, and cash, has been spent on the special effect than the script and the story. The entire enterprise, while looking incredible, is clumsily plotted and emotionally ineffectual. Ava DuVernay hammers in the sentimental moments but does very little to make us care about the characters, and seems more concerned with getting us to the next flashy set piece than creating an interesting story. To be fair, there's not a lot you could do with a script this cliched and banal, featuring a tonne of bland platitudes and uninteresting conflicts. The story is utterly nonsensical, and the rules seem to be made up as the film go along, and even though it doesn't have enough time to make the characters engaging, it does have enough time to turn to Reese Witherspoon into a Pokémon and have her fly around a planet for several minutes. It should be noted that nothing is accomplished while on this planet, and they then travel a place to consult a character who advises them where to go next. Shouldn't that have been the first place they went? It's best not to think too hard about it; the filmmakers clearly didn't, and I'm not even remotely surprised that it flopped at the box office. It's all well and good having your movie celebrate diversity and equality, but if your film fails then your message will fail, and A Wrinkle In Time has nothing to say that a million other movies hasn't said already.",

However, despite the eye-catching gazes and genuine sense of otherworldly surrealism that perpetuates the hearts and minds of all audiences, it's neither a great film within itself, nor is it a great adaptation. This doesn't just account to how many liberties were taken in the adaptation process, but more within the overall story itself. It's perfectly elaborate scale and heart-warming messages kind of want to offer more than what was briefly glimpsed at or even explored in the overall narrative that would have benefited the overarching style of this film willing to be both faithful to it's source material counterpart and creative piece of family-friendly Disney-esque surreal cinema. Thus the overall film offers a decent viewing experience for it's moral/themes and sense of adventure, but doesn't fulfill the greater aspect of it's ambitions nor it's tremendous world-building mechanics to really be very measurable to it's source material counterpart. Recommended with caution nonetheless, especially to those within it's target audience.",

Reese Witherspoon's Mrs. Whatsit is perhaps the most whimsical, but apart from her, the lack of subtlety leaves much to be desired from older audiences. Perhaps the least subtle aspect of the film is OPRAH as Mrs.Which, whose literal gigantic presence on screen only serves to magnify the silliness of worshiping at the altar of OPRAH.  The visuals are wonderful, and the acting by most everyone is very good (despite the characters not having that much to do in the movie).

This film, however, does the opposite--it removes the best parts of the book and keeps the most weak parts, adding to the weakness and even dragging it out.\n\nYou know the \"happy medium\" that has been pretty universally terrible in every version? Well the actor himself is thankfully more tolerable here but I hope you enjoy watching people struggle to stand on one foot for half an hour (this scene drags on and onnnnnn). Similarly, the magical creature ride on the first planet they get to... in the book at least they had a reason for the ride, to see the darkness and watch light literally fight it off giving you further insight into what sort of wonderous creatures the 3 lady's are and how important the battle is... in the film that is ALL gone and you're left with less than stellar CGI with our characters stupidly grinning in \"wonder\", omg, how magical! Except we're flying for no reason. And there's an action sequence because we were dumb, and that's REALLY what I wanted to see-- Our characters (who are all supposed to be extremely smart) doing STUPID things.\n\nI'm going to have to bullet point the rest of this because I have so many complaints:\n\n* The witches are introduced and are stunning and beautiful the entire film. This is a problem because they're supposed to be seen as quirky homeless-types at the start (the sort of person you might genuinely be concerned your 7 year old is talking to) which makes their later glory/wisdom all the more surprising and meaningful.\n* Talking/moving flowers. Puke.\n* Calvin is useless in this film. The actor does fine (though all he really has to do is smile and praise our protagonist at weird moments). I would have cut film Calvin entirely, he contributes nothing plot-wise or theme-wise.\n* Meg is not portrayed as actually smart, she's just a normal high schooler dealing with the stereotypical high school bully problems. Charles Wallace isn't smart either--but they TALK about how smart he is and we see him drawing so that must mean he's smart, right?! No, that just means he likes doodling like every other kid.\n* Bouncing ball Camazotz  scene: not terrible, actually. But it could have been a lot more unnerving and creepy. It was way too short and transitioned into my next complaint--\n* Beach scene. What the actual heck. Charles Wallace just gets brainwashed... because. Why not  In the book he gets taken control of because he CHOOSES to go to IT, his hubris and feelings of superiority gets the best of him and leads to his downfall. So much more interesting than \"number number, okay, I'm bad now for no reason.\"\n* Meg and her father. I admit that I loved the scene of them reuniting, that was well acted and sweet. But god almighty the movie deliberately chose not to address him leaving Charles Wallace behind and Meg being furious at him because of it. In fact, Meg isn't given a moment of bravery and sacrifice CHOOSING to return alone to try and save her brother, instead she just screams and refuses to get whisked away in the first place. Look, I get time restrictions and all but couldn't you have cut 10 minutes of rock balancing and green creature flying to actually give our characters a meaningful arc?\n\nIn this movie people are special just because people say they are, not because they actually say or do anything special. The whole time I watched it I just cringed or groaned. Heck, I'll even say that the crappy tv movie was better than this one because at LEAST they got some of the arcs right (and I can forgive some bad effects since they obviously didn't have the money).",

            "content": "Disney's latest live-action outing is a dimension-traversing trip that centres on troubled 13-year-old Meg (Storm Reid), as she journeys into the unknown to find her scientist father (Chris Pine) who disappeared four years earlier. Joined by her precocious whizz-kid brother Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe) and cute-guy-next-door Calvin (Levi Miller), our headstrong but vulnerable protagonist must confront both evil otherworldly forces and her own life-blocking emotions. Aiming to be accessible for younger audiences, the core message - internal growth is impossible without self-belief - is hardly new, but, despite a completely on-the-nose delivery, it's also effective. The connective tissue isn't always the best (the less time spent thinking about plot machinations the better), though there's no shortage of thrills and wonder, or heart wrenching payoffs, in the numerous high-concept set pieces. There are parts of this movie that are unintentionally silly and a few of director Ava DuVerney's stylistic choices are dubious (over-sized Oprah Winfrey? standard black-tentacle incarnation of 'evil'?), yet enough goodwill is generated elsewhere to forgive these missteps. DuVerney doesn't hide her influences either, family classics such as Avatar and Wizard of Oz are obvious touchstones whilst more adult-leaning masterpieces like 2001: A Space Odyssey and even The Exorcist (\"Charles Wallace is not at home right now\") provide inspiration. Reid is an absolute gem in the lead role too, equally convincing in her self-destructive stubbornness to detach from the world as she is in the gradual shift to valuing her strengths, weaknesses and everything in between. She feels right at home sharing the big screen with Hollywood veterans such as Reese Witherspoon and Oprah Winfrey, who, along with comedian Mindy Kaling, play an amusing trio of peculiar beings that guide our heroes on their trek. Ambitious to a fault, A Wrinkle in Time is a family-friendly fantasy saga that wears its heart on its sleeve whilst delivering a visually wondrous, if occasionally scatty, rollercoaster ride.",

Oprah can't act to save her life, but her performance is Oscar-worthy compared to Mindy Kaling's, which has all the dynamic expression of a wet log.  The director somehow even managed to drag all the personality out of Zach Galifianakis.

It is certainly important to go in with a child's wonder, as some of the gaps or character traits are not as explained/fleshed out as in some other movies.

A Wrinkle in Time is very ambitious and harbours a grand scope with a story that explores the unseen parts of the universe. Unfortunately the execution isn't great and it doesn't leave behind a whole lot to be enjoyed. The plot follows young Meg (Storm Reid) who after the disappearance of her father (Chris Pine) is visited by three mystical beings and embarks on an adventure through the universe to find him. The scope of the story is very large whilst also remaining focused on a small group of characters so despite the fact that it misses beats a lot of the time there is stuff in here I did like. The visuals are a definite strong point, very crisp and clear, and Meg's story actually does have a fair amount of heart and emotion going for it and it helps in offering something to keep you awake. But the negatives heavily outweigh the positives so even when it exhibits good things it still feels held back by everything else. \n\n\n\nI'll begin with the characters because where I loved Meg's personal journey through the film and her overall development, I wasn't really invested in any of the other characters aside from how they help Meg grow into her own. The path she takes through here is very engaging and its a journey all about family, love, and accepting who you are on the inside and out so her story individual story has a strong message to it. The relationship with her younger brother and her missing father is a well executed dynamic here and gives the film a lot of heart and a couple of strong emotional scenes you genuinely care about. But all of the other characters don't really have any individual arcs or growth, more or less the people they are at the outset is who they are when the credits roll. They serve their role in strengthening Meg's character but there wasn't really anything about them to latch onto. Her younger brother Charles Wallace played by very well by Deric McCabe is the most engaging of the rest of the cast but that's due to his very unique 'out there' personality being quite the opposite to everyone else in here. The three beings played by Reese Witherspoon, Mindy Kaling, and Oprah Winfrey are fine, I didn't really enjoy watching them specifically but they bother me that much. They're vessels used to drive the plot forward and say motivational things to Meg, so they're there but they're not interesting characters. \n\nAnd then there's Calvin, Levi Miller's character whose name I had to look up and whose overall purpose in this story is pretty non-existent. He kind of just shows up at one point and joins the adventure but we don't know who he is and it's almost as if Meg doesn't know really who he is but he sticks around anyway. His character just feels so damn forced into this story like he was shoved in just for some sort of cliché romantic angle because he doesn't really do anything. And I've got nothing against Levi's performance, I feel like he plays the character as he has been instructed it's just that there isn't a place in the story for him which is why he just floats around. The rest of the performances are all very fine, Chris Pine and Gugu Mbatha-Raw included, it's just the writing of these characters and the way they do or don't play into the story which is very subpar. \n\n\n\nThe overall story and physical journey the characters take through the universe fails to be engaging at almost any moment. As I mentioned, aside from Meg's personal story there's nothing of value to really grasp onto. The pacing is completely out of whack, the initial setup moves so fast it's hard to follow and leads to further issues, then later on large chunks of the film slow down to where it occasionally becomes a bit of a bore. The biggest problem stemming from the opening act being so rushed is a lot of the character decisions and reactions to certain events don't come across as very genuine, like the writers have just had characters accept certain things that I'd expect one would be questioning profusely. It also begins at a point where it feels like there's a lot of missing information, especially with Charles Wallace whose journey is already underway when Meg's story begins, some of this becomes clearer with time but it's all still a bit iffy. So many sequences just drag on and slow the film down drastically. For instance, one location they visit where they meet a character played by Zach Galifianakis is eternally boring, the film screeches to a halt and it takes a bit to break out of that lull which is a shame. There is an antagonistic presence in here as is expected, but I still don't understand it and exactly what or why or how it is. I won't go into detail about it to withhold spoilers but it's just weirdly conveyed. \n\n\n\nSo in the end, Ava DuVernay's first venture into the world of big budget fantasy adventures hasn't really gone to plan but she does some good things in here and she's more than proven her talents as a director in the past so I'm looking forward to her next project. Storm Reid is the strongest link in here and her performance brings a tonne of heart and emotion and beauty to the story where no-one else really does to the same level. Her growth over time is one of only things about the story I could grab onto and enjoy following, but despite it being good it's not enough to hold up the rest of the film. The performances are all fine and the visuals exceptional but with the lacklustre story and characters it's hard to really recommend the movie. As a casual watch I feel there might be just enough in here that a family audience can enjoy but don't expect that exciting of a fantasy adventure. \n\n4/10",

That's often noticed in scenes which feature conversations between characters. I felt if I was watching documentary or something, and that made me so confused and I really felt uneasy. \n\nThere are tons of plot holes and unexplained things from the get-go to the end of the movie. But most of the nonsensical things happened to be related to the character of Charles Wallace. Charles Wallace is a very bizarre character. This character and everything related to it don't make any sense ,alas, Charles Wallace is really a big deal in the story and its messy plot. To add insult to injury, the child who played this character, Deric McCabe, is a very bad actor; for a big part of the movie he was trying to act like a cool sweet young kid, but he is not, then we see him overacting. I wonder if this character, Charles Wallace, is also poorly written in the novel? \n\nMrs. Which, Whatsit, and Who characters have many cringe-worthy moments, and I blame no one but the director, Ava DuVernay, and maybe also Mindy Kaling (Mr. Who) who I should blame; what an annoying character and infuriating performance from Mindy Kaling!\n\nI don't have so much to say about Zach Galifianakis or Peña's performances, but I didn't neither like their characters.\n\nI think Storm Reid who played Meg, the protagonist, did a really god job. But the only performance that I can really praise is Chris Pine as Meg's father; he is great and due to his performance, the dramatic and the emotional value, which I didn't get, became slightly better. \n\nThere are very few scenes where the CGI was okay, but, in general, it's weak and cartoonish, and that's due to the bad green screen that is glaringly obvious.\n\nI liked the comprehensive concept of the evil as an antagonist, but what we got from it in the third act was disgraceful! I really suffered while watching this act with all its dull and illogical twists.\n\nI'm very disappointed! I haven't watched many movies that have been released this year, but this is definitely one of the worst.\n\nFrom now on I'll call this movie A Wrinkle in Logic!\n\n(4/10)",

            "content": "The cinematic relationship within an adaptation between a book and a film tends to attract spectators to the film before knowing there's already a book at the first thought. Should I read the book before seeing the film to see whether or not it's a faithful adaptation? Or just go straight to the film and read the book another time? It should be based on the level of your own anticipation towards the upcoming film that you may like to see in the theaters before reading the book.\n\n\"The Martian\" provided an interesting narrative while \"Wonder\" showed a heartening promise, and both films apparently proved to be subconsciously faithful without reading the book. Then there's Disney's latest dive into the fantasy genre as a new film form of imagination that's based off from the pages being transformed under Disney's magical hypnosis effect. \"A Wrinkle in Time\" was earlier compelling, along with a nice set of announced cast, by a possible mysterious concept that may be concerning time travel. But after seeing the film, after being compelled to check out the book a week prior, it may have been a different experience below the initial expectations.\n\nThe story focuses on a young girl named Meg Murry, who been dealing with the disappearance of her father Dr. Alex Murry for five years since he somehow discovered a new planet. Her wandering little brother Charles Wallace meets the mysterious astral travelers Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who and Mrs. Which; then the two siblings, joined by Meg's classmate Calvin, got put into a dangerous journey to bring back their father under the travelers' guidance. It would take the kids' bravery to get through a planet that possesses the universe's evil soul, while the siblings' bond will be put into an eventual test along the way.\n\nFrom what I grasped after the first viewing, \"A Wrinkle in Time\" is rather complex to the meaningful soul mainly by the abrupt folds in the narrative flow, lacking any smoothness for the characters and the overall approach. It's another of those attempts made by Disney to be ambitious only to occasionally falter when created a visionary void with not much to fill the rest for balance that's relied on to the writing and the cast. The descriptive and emotional human soul noticeably provides repetitive moments for the heroine's understanding of the surrounding circumstance with communicated lines that tried to go beyond, only to turn out to be awkward writing.\n\nThanks to the writing, it had affected the nicely-selected cast's somewhat squandered talents, but not their charms when putting literal-balanced energy into their characters. Respectively portraying the astral travelers, Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon and Mindy Kaling did their best to guide through a fantasy scale while radiating pleasantness in their known presence. Chris Pine energetically performed fine when setting the idea up and trying to put it all to rest. The main, most-energetic spotlight goes to the young stars Levi Miller and breakthroughs Storm Reid and Deric McCabe as they venture throughout the given flow and gave it their best than the veteran actors, though still part of the unbalancing. Simply put, the appealing cast performed decently at the film's average.\n\nDirector Ava DuVernay's intention with this project besides going into the adaptation and having fun along with the rest of the cast is to express a message about diversity and female empowerment, with Jennifer Lee from \"Frozen\" as one of the writers. She did that nicely well amid the visionary void through the characterization under her own spin, especially when providing an insightful understanding as a moral pinch of social commentary salt - hence the meaningfulness. Accompanying that approach next to the characters, along with occasional unique style, is the elegantly fitting music that seems to express the encouraging spirit that composer Ramin Djawadi didn't need to heighten.\n\nSo yeah \"A Wrinkle in Time\" may be questioned regarding its faithfulness to the unread source material as it would take another viewing then a reading of the book to fully grasp it. But as of the first viewing, despite not really being engaging as hoped, it's a decent film for visual entertainment with a subtext in the veins as part of the celebrated soul in reflection form. How flawed it may be at the front with qualities to enjoyably appreciate, it's more important that the cast and production crew had fun doing the project. Otherwise if they didn't, it would be a bad movie. (B)",

But for me it looked like a perfect illustration of what has been happening in our world politically over the last couple of years. There were a few more poignant moments in the film. But, unfortunately, just moments. And there was just one character that felt alive - Charles Wallace. He made me cry real tears. Little Deric McCabe outacted a bunch of grownups, some of whom are Oscar winners. Reese Witherspoon, whom I loved in so many different roles, was just all Legally Blonde here. Poor Mindy Kahling was reduced to smiling and saying words that weren't even her character's own. Oprah was being Oprah - no more, no less. Chris Pine was stuck in a permanent state of angst. And Zack Galifianakis made an attempt to liven up his character, but was quickly subdued into a state of permanent soulfulness. It is so sad to see all these great performers acting as if they were making a photo shoot for the movie, not the movie itself. Or better yet - one of those fake rides they have at Universal Studios. In fact, much of the film felt as if they were already thinking about a ride as they were making it. My 9 year old liked it. Hopefully it will make him want to read the book.

And the worst part is that to make up for those losses, they added in exactly what you wouldn’t expect... Meg trying to balance on a rock for 20 minutes. It was also extremely choppy, moving from scene to scene in a weird and unnecessary way, and focused way too much on the sights and emotional moments to the point that it took away from the whole plot and adventurous spirit the book had. And please, do not get me started with the acting. Instead, I think the words “Unexplainably Bad” can easily make my point.

Messages were twisted, sub plots were overly brief and messages were shallow at best. Disney had all the resources to make this great and they failed. Major disappointment. Worst movie I've seen in a while. Two scary for little kids(demonic possession, child abandonment) No explanation of science, no explanation of title other than a 3 second animation. Terrible attempt at scientific justification for flying was \"lift\" and for getting picked up and thrown by a tornado - \"physics\".  Writers might have attempted to involve a real scientist for the writing. Also these writers should be given an award for worst writing ever. This movie could join \"The Room\" as a cult classic for how bad it is.  Looks like the glitter budget was bigger than the  writing, editing, and directing budgets combined based on the product.",

Visually, this movie had many well-designed scenes and effects.  And from an overall narrative perspective, I felt there was a lot of emphasis placed on making sure the viewer could sympathize with Meg's difficult teenage life.  Therein lies the crux of the movie.  The CGI spectacles and science jargon are really just background material to highlight what \"A Wrinkle in Time\" is really about - the power of love and accepting oneself to make a difference in the world (not about whether girls can do science too or any other mis-guided view of this movie).  Where I get a little hung up on this movie is trying to nail down who is the target audience.  Clearly teenagers, teenage girls, and people who read the original novel are the intended audience; but the spectacle level of this movie seems like it is aiming to reach a broader audience.  I just don't think the casual moviegoer will get much out of the high-minded physics concepts or the fantastical elements which seem oriented toward younger viewers.  And younger viewers are likely to be disturbed by the actions of Charles Wallace and The It at many points in the back half of this movie.  To be honest, the movie reminded me of a mashup between movies such as Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, Interstellar, and Spy Kids.  As one who formerly read this book I got a fair amount of enjoyment from the movie based on fun character interactions, the inclusion of key elements from the novel, beautiful imagery, and several touching thematic moments which spoke even to me as an adult.  I highly recommend this movie for anyone looking for a movie that explores new worlds, anyone who read the novel, and anyone who enjoys young adult themed books or movies.  For everyone else, check it out for a matinee or rent it later.",

The direction and special effects provide a world unlike any other. This is sure to be a watch for sci-fi fans.\nThe story follows Meg Murry (Storm Reid), a genial teen who is the daughter of famed scientist Alex Murry (Chris Pine). After her father disappears, she goes through a period of insecurity and despair. Four years later, a group of primordial celestial beings - Mrs. Which (Oprah Winfrey), Mrs. Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon) and Mrs. Who (Mindy Kaling) visit Earth to help Meg find her father. Meg's brother Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe) and friend Calvin (Levi Miller) also join the quest to find Alex. However, Meg is also brought in to help fight the \"It\", an entity of darkness that threatens to destroy people's happiness. \nStorm Reid, as Meg, excellently presents her inner struggle to be happy and accept herself and this adds a unique element to the story. As the movie progresses, she slowly rises beyond her doubts to become better. Chris Pine, as Alex, delivers an ardent love for science in his character and, while much of his character is witnessed before he disappears, the rest of his scenes add a performance filled with remorse. Deric McCabe, as Charles Wallace, is my favorite character due to his charismatic performance - full of comic relief. Levi Miller, as Calvin, encompasses a respectful companion who seems to be rather enamored by Meg. Oprah Winfrey, as Mrs. Which, is a wise mentor for Meg who guides her throughout her journey. Reese Witherspoon, as Mrs. Whatsit, is the least wise of the three celestial beings, but she provides a kind companion. Mindy Kaling, as Mrs. Who, represents an encyclopedia of character teeming with knowledge.\nAva DuVernay incredibly directs the movie, as you feel as if you are a part of the world through her use of word building to convey a story. My favorite scene is the resolution to the main conflict, as it feels like an appropriate conclusion. My problem with the movie is that is unevenly paced, with the first half of the movie following generic clichés, despite a great first 10 minutes. But the movie gets running as soon as the second half begins, going into uncharted territory unlike any other movie. I also feel that the scenes for Alex and some other plot points are limited, resulting in a few disjointed, convoluted narrative at times and that could throw off some audience members. \nThe message of the movie is about believing in yourself and accepting who you are. I give this film 3.5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 6 to 18. \n\nreviewed by arjun N., kids first! film critic. for more reviews by youth, visit kidsfirst dot org.",

My rating does not reflect the controversies with the book, but just the movie itself. A Wrinkle in Time over foreshadowed the future, and there was no surprise that I was looking for. I can see how some people can connect with the Mrs.'s, but I personally felt relieved when they left the screen. As weird as it may seem, I and many others struggled to connect with the lead characters, despite their similarities to many other people. \n\nIn all, connections were lacking, the theme of the story was an extremely non-risky move, and the rest of the departments in the film struggled to make such a poor idea good. I hope that we can somehow move such amazing resources in the industry to work on stories that we can all enjoy.",

Meg her Brother and Friend go off on an adventure through time and space to try and find her father.\nThis is a visually stunning film sometimes and then sometimes it is also fairly horrible looking. There is no escaping it, some of the special effects and green-screen are extremely noticeable and they're not quite as impressive as I think this film thinks they are; especially for a Disney production.\nThere are some very touching scenes most of them involving Meg's family, you really do feel a sense of warmth in their household and when her father disappears you feel for character. \nBut from the first act to the third act the story is such a jumbled mess, it felt like the movie was missing something after the touching opening. That was the human touch, after the first act the film was just really a lot of Wow sequences that didn't really land.\nWhen it comes to the Children leading the film all three give good performances for the most part, Storm Reid who plays Meg is fairly good in the movie especially in some of the more emotional scenes, she doesn't really show a lot of surprise when the awe-inspiring moments are happening before her eyes which was a little strange, but she is very good as an awkward young girl who is not comfortable with her own self yet.\nHer younger brother Charles Wallace started off strong then a lot of focus was on his character neither the end and sadly this is where he fell off.\nBut the over reliance of the younger cast pushes a lot of them to one side, some of them just get one or two scenes in the movie which was incredibly disappointing to see.\nI think there's a chance that kids today will see this movie and it will be there Hook, Hook was critically pan by critics in 1991, but kids from that era love it.

Purists will pounce, often rightly, if the movie fails to stay true to the book. This is the crux A Wrinkle in Time finds itself in, and although it has the ingredients for a great movie, the best it ends up being is a good enough movie.\n\nPeople remember the sense of wonder and imagination the novel inspired in them the most, so naturally, that area is A Wrinkle in Time's strongest suit. Director Ava DuVernay does a commendable job visualizing the majestic worlds of the book. While each scene is shot in a real environment, like the redwood forests of California, the more fantastical elements are recreated through CGI. The CGI blends in perfectly with the live action. Unfortunately, it's also up to the audience to imagine where the characters are, as the editing sometimes loses track of them. On a more subtle level, the costume and makeup design convey the otherworldly nature of the adult characters by changing ever so slightly as the movie goes on. What really impressed me, however, was how the characters are framed. Instinctively, you can tell how they are feeling or whether they are good or bad based on how they're positioned in relation to the camera.\n\nAlthough the movie does a good job adapting that wonder, it's attempt at adapting the story itself is a little more mixed. Personally, I thought the book's dialogue was clunky, particularly in the beginning. For the most part, the script updates the 50 year old dialogue, so the characters speak more like modern audiences. Granted, Charles Wallace still gets called Charles Wallace every single time another character addresses him, but what are you going to do about that? The beginning also spends more time depicting the lives of the Murray family and explores their characters, which makes the decision to cut out Aunt Beast's scene later in the film so puzzling. Given that A Wrinkle in Time has trouble pinning down its pacing for most of the movie, it makes sense to maintain the climaxes' momentum by streamlining it into a single scene, but in doing so, the movie loses a key opportunity to delve into its characters and make their story arcs resonate with the audience. It doesn't help that the themes are sanitized of their religious undertones. On the other hand, the message of diversity that takes their place is laudable. Which is a shame, because DuVernay is a talented director, and Storm Reid shows potential as a child actor. Ultimately, though, A Wrinkle in Time is an OK movie when it could have been a great one.",

She's shut herself out from others and other kids and adults don't show her much sympathy.\n\tBut soon three magical women show up and they tell Meg that her father discovered a new way to travel to places that are a long way away.  However he gets stuck in that  stuck in that distant place for the past four years.  \n\tMeg and her brother, Charles - along with a friend, Calvin, rush off to a strange and far away land to find and rescue him.\n\tOn the first stop in their journey, the women tell our heroes about a creature called \"the It\" (note: not Pennywise).  This dark mass of ... stuff threatens to turn humanity against itself using mind control and persuasion.\n\tBut Meg isn't leaving without her father - even if she has to face her greatest fears and take on her biggest challenges.\n\nSCORING\nMain Characters\n\tThese three are okay.  I like Meg a lot because she really has trouble keeping it together after daddy vanishes.  But the other two felt really bland in comparison.  I would've like a better explanation as to why Calvin comes along on this trip.  SCORE: 6\n\nSupporting Cast\n\tThe three magical ladies have some flair to them - but they're only good in short bits before they get annoying.  Good thing they bow out of the film early and let the kids shine.  SCORE: 8\n\nPlot\n\tThis film would've been better without the action sequences - like the tornado scene or the beach scene.  And some of the tests really don't make sense - like the taste the sandwiches test.  SCORE: 3\n\nOriginality\n\tThis film has the making of an interesting twist on a sci-fi, psychological movie, but some parts just felt flat - like when Meg finds her father.  SCORE: 5\n\nViolence Factor\n\tThe last scene has Meg getting physically beat up by the It.  It would've been better just to keep it all in her head.  SCORE: 4\n\nOther Moral Issues\n\tThis film is supposed to talk about overcoming your fears - but the message just doesn't resonate because the tests they go through don't really test them very much.  SCORE: 5\n\nFinal Score (out of 60): 31\t\t% Score: 51.67%\n\tThe book's always better than the movie, but this one needed to spend less time with the visuals and more time developing the conflicts between the characters - and the It.",

A Wrinkle in Time is definitely a sight to behold. Throughout the film, the audience is treated to a visual spectacle with panoramic grandeur. At times, the film shines through to deliver to us the message of accepting oneself regardless of what flaws we think we may have and using that power of self worth to overcome the obstacles in life. The film, however, ends up trying too hard to convey that message and it doesn't help having the 3 celestial beings dressed up the way they are with all that makeup which adds a layer of campiness to movie that otherwise wants to be taken seriously. The acting is distracting during certain key moments along with clunky dialogue.

A carefully reading of the same text might evoke vastly different reactions depending on the readers state of mind and life experience. The same applies to this movie, the creative team had to take a text that explodes in your imagination and define it to set of images and sounds. That will always disappoint some people, because that interpretation might be vastly different than yours. So this is post modern film based on a mortality tale. Will this film be seen in ten years as the definitive portrayal of the book, no. This film might inspire many bright young minds to make great films in the future. I liked it.

The mere fact that this past weekend saw the first time 2 movies with 2 directors of color top the box office is astonishing and inspiring. It's long overdue, and should be lauded. On that note, A Wrinkle in Time is a film that ends up being of far more importance than it does a film that will please most. To say the least, it's a mess.\n\nI walked out of the theater trying to quantify what this film felt like, and I think to me, it's a Disney Channel Original Movie with the budget of your typical summer blockbuster. The budget of a little over 100 million is actually historic, for giving the first black woman a budget that high to direct a film. But that's not even necessarily the problem with the film. The problem lies with the screenplay and perhaps partially DuVernay's direction.\n\nI've never read the book, nor had the interest to, but I have to imagine there was an easier way to adapt this book than the result we got. The story revolves around Meg, who's father has gone missing for years, as she tries to travel through time and space with a few strange beings, her brother, and a new friend from school. Perhaps some audiences, mostly on the younger side, will connect to the story of reconnection and family, but the execution is mind-bogglingly silly.\n\nThere are particular story choices in the 3rd act that are laughably out of place, and even a few blatant mistakes in directing that I never truly could grasp how they got past the editing room. If this were to have come out when I was younger, perhaps it's something I could connect with. But a well-performed and semi-visually impressive film isn't enough to surpass all of the frustrating mistakes in the script and direction.\n\n4.0/10",

The film does a good job in emphasizing family connections and love, and a decent job of making \"faults\" an acceptable aspect of one's self. For kids, it is visually appealing and has some thrill. All that said, something didn't quite come together...it sought to be visually stunning, but wasn't inspiring at the same time, which seems to miss the mark. No matter what, this is an incredible performance by Storm Reid! Reese was expectedly quirky and Oprah maternal/grandmaternal, if not only because she and Storm could--by appearances alone--well be related. Deric McCabe is endearing and believable as a precocious Charles Wallace. All in all, see it, but if will be a movie you see only once or twice. Better in the theater than at home.",

The visuals were spectacular; from the costumes to the hair to the makeup to the beautiful images of flowers and greeny. It was just visually stunning. I liked the fact that this movie really focused on believing in yourself and being a warrior in your life. It's a message that everyone needs to hear nowadays. The only downsides to me was the beginning of the movie cause it was a tad slow and I did not like the little girl's brother. He was just way too annoying to me but overall, it was really good film.

There is not a single character that I did not hate within five minutes of their introduction. I laughed at the big villain moment because I am not intimidated by five year olds. Itd a movie that attempts to be inspiring and insightful when it has nothing more to say than 'The hippies were right, love solves all the worlds problems'. I can't recommend it on the visuals because the only good visual effects scene was at the end of the movie and the rest of them look like they were done by interns. I can't recommend this movie to parents because the moral of the story - if you can call it that - is that if you just love hard enough, Daddy will come back and the bullies at school will be nice to you.\n\nFor the love of God, capital G divine one-and-only God, do not take a child to see this mpvie. No child deserves to have this inflicted on them. No child needs even the barest hint of the thought that they can make Daddy come back or make solve other complex real-world issues just by loving at it hard enough, because if yiu convince a kid that and loving at it doesn't work, wellI guess that means you didn't love Daddy enough/I guess you're just not loving enough to be treated with basic human respect.\n\nI have a habit of being hyperbolic and exaggerating to make things more amusing but here, now, for thebfirst time in my life I am genuinely just this pissed off at something.

Let’s start with the positives. Oprah, for what she was in during the movie, she did a good job. Same goes with Chris Pine. The movie was mostly visually stunning and had great costumes and hairstyling. Now let’s go into the negatives. The movie was so jumbled around that it couldn’t keep a steady plot. Things would just happen out of nowhere and what bugged me was that characters were just fine with it. None of the characters were too surprised with what happened in the movie. The acting wasn’t that good either. It’s hard with kids so you most of the time shouldn’t have the highest expectations. There was this one kid. He played the character Charles Wallace. My god was he horrible. He was by far the worst part of the film. They really needed to work with his character. There were also some stuff in the trailer that weren’t in the movie which isn’t a good thing in my opinion. There were random pop songs that were placed at totally random parts and weren’t needed. The first half of the first act was good, then it started to get worse and worse. The third act of the movie to me wasn’t good. It was nothing exciting and didn’t catch my attention. I got bored during some parts of the movie. I can’t say the movie was absolutely terrible, but I can’t say I liked it. It was mainly a Disney cash grab that failed at the box office. If you want to see it, go ahead, but don’t expect too much. My Grade: C-",

I found this movie vitriol to the soul, leading me to suicidal and self-harming thoughts. These emotions were brought up by the fact that the main characters did not smack lips. The result of missing the interlocked lips, i concluded a lower rating i would perceive that this movie is deserving of.\nI am in deep aungish and am in search of a mental hospital or family theripist close to the area around the tesserae due to the deep wounds cut in my flesh from the film.

If this was an original story/screenplay and NOT based on a classic, it never would have been made by a mainstream studio.",

So I have to be honest when I say that I was very much let down by this film. Don’t get me wrong, visually it was beautiful and it was definitely moving at times. But that was not enough to make up for what it lacked. Which in my opinion was focus on the overall story as well as context. There just seemed to be a lot missing from the narrative and at times certain things felt glossed over. And that is coming from someone who has never read the book. So I can only imagine how others might feel. Overall this wasn’t a bad film, however the more it sits with me the more I find things to complain about. So I’ll stop here and say don’t just take my word for it, see it and decide for yourselves. Rating: 4/10",

But a terrible screenplay and atrocious editing basically ruin the film (the last scene is a glacially-paced torture of cringe-worthy treacle). They made numerous ill-considered decisions about the narrative that weaken most of the characters in ways that seemed to me completely unnecessary, and - the greatest sin of all, to my mind - they simply do not appear to have trusted the book. And there is too much straight up exposition where one or two hints would suffice. The film's version of the story was flat... it lacked the depth, awe, reverence, humanity, compassion, and \"true-ness\" in the characters' reactions to the supernatural/spiritual forces they encounter that permeated L'Engle's story. The word \"universe\" is thrown about constantly but instead the focus is tight and myopic; not universal at all. I'm so disappointed. I feel like it would have been better if it were not made.",

But where Tomorrowland was simply misguided, Wrinkle... is a straight-up disaster.

Unfortunately, this engaging young actress can't quite right this time-traveling ship. The rest of the oddly-casted actors certainly don't help. Galifianakis plays a god-like being doing modern, self-aware schtick for some reason (\"I like earthtones.\"); Witherspoon's comic-relief is more annoyingly repetitve than funny; brilliant ad-libber Kaling is forced into delivering constant platitudes; and deus-ex-Oprah leans into stoicism instead of inspiration. \nThese obnoxious side-characters disappear eventually, and the film gets better for it, with potent descriptions of the evil \"It\" and some great, creepy suburban set-pieces. But it's really too late at that point. So much has gone wrong in so many ways (clunky editing, awful exposition, abrasive music, unearned emotions, prescription drug commercial graphics, ill-timed humor, laughable performances, etc), blame must be placed on normally stellar director DuVernay (Selma) for how unwieldy the final product feels.

The storytelling is largely visual as the exposition heavy novel gets heavily streamlined in the opening scenes, creating confusion for those who are not familiar at all with the book. Still, the film adaptation won't work on everyone, as its optimistic and thoroughly cheesy hearted spectacle might annoy viewers looking for sophisticated fantasy.

The special effects are stunning and groundbreaking.  Where the film falls short is on two levels.  First, it takes too many liberties with the source material.  With its religious undertones in the book, the film disregards all of those elements that helped drive the story and characters to the climatic end.  Second, it is a film with hesitation.  It tries to be somewhat true to the original source material while trying to update it for the modern audience.  It leads to some moments being awkward and unpolished.  If you want to see a well polished film, that is faithful to it's source material, then I would not watch this film",

            "content": "A Wrinkle in Time (3 out of 5 stars). A Wrinkle in Time a fantasy adventure film that is visually beautiful and stunning to look at if you can get by with a plot that seems hallow. I never read the book; I am coming from a fresh perspective on this film. And it is not Disney's worse film like Tomorrowland. The performances were emotional and inspirational. The visual effects were great. But the plot seems thin when you think about it after it is over. It is one of those films that you see once and may not enjoy the experience again. The plot follows Meg (Storm Reid) after years with the disappearance of her father Dr. Alex (Chris Pine). When he was working on something new that can transport a person between space and time to another universe. Meg's younger adoptive brother Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe) is a genius and has been speaking to Mrs. Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon). Mrs. Whatsit tries to recruit Meg, Charles, and her friend Calvin (Levi Miller) to go on a journey to another planet to search for her missing father. What worked great with A Wrinkle in Time? The film's visual effects were spectacular. Meg meets the three ladies Mrs. Who (Mindy Kaling), Mrs. Which (Oprah Winfrey), and Mrs. Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon) and they go to a beautiful planet, were the flowers speak to each other. They fly through a sky from a mystical transformed creature. Then, they travel to a rocky balanced setting, were they meet Zach Galifianakis's character. Then, to a dark place called the it, were all the dark negative energy lies upon. It is a fun adventure to see these beautiful visual effects. Which is also the weakness of this film as well. When the film relies on visuals over storytelling. Storm Reid did perfect with her performance. You grow to like her character. Levi Miller was also okay as well that has an attraction to Meg. Chris Pine was good as her father for the brief moments that he is on screen. Reese Witherspoon and Mindy Kaling were great as well. What did not work with A Wrinkle in Time? Like I said above, the film relying on visuals over storytelling. The movie is all visual effects and there may be scenes were it is overdone. But the plot is thin. It is about a father's passion in discovering new planets in different universes. And the voyage to the unknown. When Meg goes traveling to one visual fest set piece to another. Meeting new characters and getting a lead to another new setting. There is not much of a story when characters are just traveling to another eye candy visual set piece. There is a theme of love in the film. But does poorly on trying to execute a story. Also, I feel like Oprah Winfrey, Deric McCabe, and Michael Pena's performances were just dull. Winfrey as Mrs. Which did not have any depth with the character. Deric McCabe did decent as a genius kid. Michael Pena as Red was just terrible. Overall, A Wrinkle in Time is a fair film. The visual effects are spectacular but overwhelming. The plot is thin and forgettable. Storm Reid was great and some decent performances from the supporting cast. Otherwise, I will recommend the film as a rental unless you are a fan of the book or want to see some stunning visuals on the big screen.",

            "content": "A Wrinkle in Time is based on a beloved children's classic published in 1961. It's directed by Ava DuVernay, who was responsible for Selma, one of the best films of 2014. There's a reason that Marvel offered her the directing gig for Black Panther. This film has big names, a big budget, and big talent behind the camera with a focus on upping the inclusion at the Mouse House... so why is the movie so unfortunately awful? A Wrinkle in Time is one of the worst experiences I've had in a theater. I was so thoroughly unattached that I started questioning how something this bad was so beloved for decades by different generations of, what I must now assume, children with terrible taste.\n\nMeg (Storm Reid) is a teenager still dealing with the pain and anger from the four-year disappearance of her father, Mr. Murry (Chris Pine). He was a scientist trying to discover a new form of space-time travel powered by... love, I think. Mrs. Murry (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) is stuck trying to rear he troublesome daughter and Meg's adopted little brother, Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe). Then one day they and Meg's crush, Calvin (Levi Miller), are visited by a trio of strange, powerful (aliens? witches? fairies? spirits?) women: Mrs. Which (Oprah Winfrey), Mrs. Who (Mindy Kaling), and Mrs. Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon). They inform Meg and company that they know where her father is. They must travel the universe to save him, battle the source of negativity, The It (no relation to Stephen King), and maybe learn a thing or two about accepting one's true self, faults and all.\n\nOprah as Dragonball Z?\n\nA Wrinkle in Time is simultaneously over complicated and meaninglessly shallow. I was baffled throughout the entirely of its near two-hour running time trying to make sense of anything. The story felt like it was written by computer that had been programmed with the scraps of genre storytelling as an exercise. There is no real internal logic that holds everything together, which makes every moment feel arbitrary. The story also lacks another vital aspect every fantasy movie needs - clarity. The goal is for the kids to find and rescue Mr. Murry, but every step leading to this goal feels unclear. Scene-to-scene, moment-to-moment, you don't have any clue how what they are doing will lead them any closer to achieving this goal. Every scene just asserts itself, and then something happens, and then something else happens, and then it's done. Hey one minute the kids are going to talk with flowers because, for whatever reason, they're the little gossips of the plant world. Then Mrs. Whatsit turns into a plant mantis goddess giant. Then the kids hop on her back and fly, and then fly on her while she's also flying, and then one kid falls off, so whoops, but the gossipy plants catch him. And then none of that matters. Even the villain is a nebulous concept of negativity designed to link up with a character's personal journey. There's a plot insofar as stuff happens and then it doesn't. The rules of this universe are never properly established. Anything is just anything in this movie. The final planet, where they do indeed find Mr. Murry, could just have easily been their first stop. If a fantasy movie doesn't properly orient the audience to its world and rules, it's only a matter of time before that same audience checks out, frustrated and uninterested.\n\nAfterwards, I did something I hardly ever do and ventured to read the Wikipedia summary to discover what was in the original story by author Madeline L'Engle. Surely the screenwriters must have butchered this oft-touted children's classic. To my surprise, the summary of the book is pretty close to what ends up in DuVernay's film, with some slight modernizing and name changing (I wonder why DuVernay might not have wanted the Big Evil Source of All Negativity to be called \"The Black Thing.\" Hmmm.). I think maybe the book was never good but was liked by kids, and then they remembered it being better and passed it along to their kids, and so on and so on, until somebody finally runs screaming through the streets, trying to get everyone to realize the harsh reality.\n\nAnother factor that doesn't seem developed or helpful or fulfilling are the three magical beings played by Oprah, Mindy Kaling, and Reese Witherspoon. It feels like they're more award show hosts constantly changing their wardrobes than characters. They offer very Oprah-like self-help platitudes about acceptance, courage, and self-actualization. I felt sympathy for each actress being wasted, in particular Kaling, who speaks only in quotes and a plethora of reaction shots where she practices a wise expression. Witherspoon is definitely overdoing it and Oprah has settled into being talk show Oprah. They felt like rejects from a discarded Alice in Wonderland movie but with less personality. I think you could cut all three out of the film completely. The only meaningful way these three characters impact the plot is as expositional devices, but even that is whimsical nonsense.\n\nSpeaking of exposition, oh boy is this script really bad when it comes to dialogue. There's an early scene that exists purely to inform the audience about the Murry children and to be eavesdropped upon by Charles Wallace (that name deserves to belong to a tax attorney or a serial killer). \"She's smart but hasn't been the same since her dad left,\" says one teacher. \"Yeah, but that little brother of hers, he's got potential but he sure is weird.\" The conversation feels painfully inauthentic and transparent. Don't these teachers have other students of equal interest at the school to discuss? The Murry children's father disappeared four years ago and they're still talking about them this sloppily? The final film is stuffed with these moments, with characters transparently telling the each other who they are or how they should feel at all times. The pointless romantic sidekick, Calvin, is literally introduced as coming over and saying, \"Hey I sorta know you from school, and I felt like I should be here,\" as if he could feel the screenplay calling him. Also, Meg just happens to live next door to her chief bully in school, who is still bullying her every day for whatever reason. It's been four freaking years since her father left, and apparently this still offends this girl on a daily basis? Most of the dialogue made me wince.\n\nIt will sound mean but we need to talk about the bad child acting in A Wrinkle in Time. In the modern age, after Room, It, and The Florida Project in particular, there really is no excuse for bad child acting. If you cannot feature quality child actors, you aren't looking hard enough or that may be a fault of the director's own abilities. McCabe (Stephanie) is, in particular, a bad choice to carry much of the movie's emotional climax at the end. He even gets possessed by the Bad Negative Force and must channel menace. It comes across more like a petulant child throwing a temper tantrum in a store. Much of the conclusion hinges on tight close-ups of McCabe bellowing. It's unfortunate for everyone. Reid (12 Years a Slave) fares a little better but is relatively inexpressive, going even beyond the general withdrawn nature of her character. Miller's (Pan) character serves no purpose. He offers no skill or breakthrough for the plot. He is just there, blank-faced, and providing PG-rated prepubescent romantic tension. Or perhaps Meg really needs to hear the strong encouragement from the voice of an attractive white male in order to finally personally succeed?\n\nDuVernay's direction has some nice, sweeping visuals but the movie as a whole feels far more awkward and misapplied with its budget. Some of the special effects are shockingly shoddy for this kind of major release from Disney. The fantasy worlds feel like holdovers from other fantasy movies with little memorable distinction. There is one effective moment visually that stands supreme, and that's when the trio encounter a suburban neighborhood populated with Children of the Damned-style kids all bouncing balls in sync. Their individual mothers come out and march in the same eerie synchronicity, and it's the best-conceived and executed piece in the film. It's also one of the few sequences where the editing is a benefit. The editing is conspicuously poor. Early on, when Mrs. Whatsit had first introduced herself, every cut failed to match, every camera movement created a disconnect of space, and it generally felt off. It didn't get better from there. When you notice the editing, unless you're in a Scorsese or Aranofsky movie, it's a bad sign.\n\nIn many ways, this film reminds me of the misguided, flabbergasting, and fascinating failed passion project that was 2014's A Winter's Tale. I could dissect that movie and its multitudinous of wrong-ness for hours. With A Wrinkle in Time, I just wanted to leave. I wanted to enjoy the movie and root for DuVernay being given the reins of a major studio film. I loved Selma and diversity behind the camera is hard to come by in Hollywood, let alone a woman of color given this sort of platform. Sadly, it feels like DuVernay wasn't quite ready. A Wrinkle in Time gave me nothing to engage with early on. I didn't care about the characters, the plot felt like it was being made up as it went, the rules were unclear, the dialogue was inauthentic, there was no sense of momentum, and when it does accidentally stumble into something slightly interesting, it quickly moves along again. It's about the power of love overcoming the power of negativity. I don't know whom this movie is for. Children will be bored. Adults will shrug. This movie doesn't work on a fundamental level and it left me bored. I closed my eyes and dreamed of a better movie but it never came to be. My dear father, who had the misfortune of enduring this experience with me, turned to me during the end credits and said, \"I am now going to treat you... by taking you far away from this movie.\" It's that bad, folks.\n\nNate's Grade: D",

Visually stunning and full of childhood magic, it loses any grit and reality the book had with completely flat characters. I love that every child could see themselves in this movie, but after being so excited from the day I heard this movie was being made, I was deeply, deeply disappointed. Disney, step up your game..",

I love Oprah, but I was not a fan of giant Oprah, much better to be the same size of the other Ms.  The costumes were eye-popping, could be an Oscar nomination for those! The kids were great, all the actors were great, but it tried to be too dazzling and lost some connection. Still worth seeing, imho, if you're a fan of the book but not necessarily a purist as there are some changes.",
