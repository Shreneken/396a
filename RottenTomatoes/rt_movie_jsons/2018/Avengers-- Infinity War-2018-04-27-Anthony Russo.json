He is well written just like all the other Characters and also just the entire Movie. We can understand his point of view, doesn't mean we agree, but we understand why he thinks the way he does and this is what makes him so perfect, he is dangerous charismatic and traceable.\nThe action and CGI are incredibly good. Acting is great like in most Marvel Movies. The Jokes hit and so do the emotional scenes. \nALSO the score is not from this world.\nThis is just a Masterpiece and definitely worth to watch it over and over again. \nSpoiler: \nSmart decision to let the „bad guy\" win and let us the audience loose a lot of our favorite characters.",

They switch to different characters constantly and yet the audience stays hooked throughout. And the ending where the heroes don't win is by far something that has never been done before, at least in a live-action superhero movie at this scale. And it isn't just the fact that they lost, but how they lost. Each hero was at their prime, yet this villain, who is clearly delusional and evil yet the audience can still understand their motive, is able to tear down each of them so easily.

I still remember once going again with someone who hasn't watched any of these movies and that person actually told me how great and emotional it was. Sometimes we so built on nostalgia that we refuse to even admit something is as great as StarWars, Lord of the rings and even Harry Potter, because let's face it, The atmosphere I have experienced for Infinity war and End Game was far beyond greater than the experience I have had with The Last Jedi and Rise of Skywalker, during Infinity War I have heard gasps, shocks and laughs far more emotion than the TLJ and Skywalker, especially by the ending.\n\nThis movie is actually an event because onthis movie is actually an event because one thing happen after another, before we can process one thing another thing happens.

The sound effects is absolutely amazing, especially with the first time they came in New York, the sound made that scene seem so real and when Thanos arrived at Wakanda, the sound made my heart beat in anticipation.

Do you think I will give it a low rating after Loki's death shocked me? When moment Bruce saw Tony after years it made me so happy, when Gamora was sacrificed I was so sad, when Captain America and Thor arrived I cheered, when Starlord ruined everything I was literally angry, and when all blimped I was in shock especially with Peter Parker...this movie is emotionally impactinge thing happen after another, before we can process one thing another thing happens.

But that doesn't mean this film is perfect their are some problems their are too many jokes in the movie you have a joke like every 5 minutes which begins to get annoying I also didn't like how Captain America wasn't in the movie that much besides that cool entrance he gets when he runs into Wanda & Vision he doesn't really do anything.  Now that's all the complaints I have now to get onto the good stuff. This film features every character we have met up to this point that's including both faction which are The Avengers & The Guardians Of The Galaxy seeing these characters all meet for the first time & interact is exciting. Thanos is the best character in the movie & to this day he is still the best MCU villain not just because he is a super strong obstacle our heroes must defeat but because his motivations & philosophy can be seen as a good thing sure the way he does things are bad but he is doing it to make the universe better which can make some see him as a anti hero instead of a full on villain. And finally let me discuss the amazing ending this film has something the other films were missing which are stakes usually when you watch a MCU movie you can easily relax since the heroes will defeat the villain around the final act & no one will die in the movie but here you can't expect that because Thanos wins & half of our heroes get erased from existence it's a beautiful scene where their is nothing to distract us from the horror we are witnessing our heroes are defeated scattered across the galaxy & to add the cherry on top it ends with Thanos smiling which is a reference to the comic where the ending was different in the comic he is smiling because he lost where here he is smiling that he accomplished his mission with the end credits just being a simple black screen with text no flashy post credit scene to pull us out of the experience like in all the other MCU movies.",

The final battle leading up to it is one of Marvel's finest, with so many earned, satisfying moments. Infinity War's only flaw is that the camera work takes little risks, and I wish they could have used some expressive shots. But that's such a small issue (more of a nitpick really), that it's almost not worth typing.

He may be the villain, but you can see his conviction, sadness, cruelty, and surprising humility in his face. He is the main character. So, this is pretty much a Thanos movie. Thanos is almost like a twisted monk in that he truly believes that he is going to save the universe through his actions. But he is truly a walking conundrum, for he desired to save the universe by destroying half of its population. I understand that he was motivated by his trauma of losing his homeworld, but it's strange how he is compassionate on a collective level, but very callous and imperious in terms of his interactions with others. So, definitely one of Brolin's best performances. Otherwise, my favorite characters in the film were Gamora, Dr. Strange, Wanda Maximoff, and Peter Parker. It's a movie that both entertains you and makes you think. One of the best MCU stories released.",

That's not necessarily an issue in itself, but sometimes their actions are forgettable, so you have to remind yourself what they're even doing. There's a big focus on the Guardians of the Galaxy which I like, but they definitely get a lot of screen time compared to other Avenger veterans. Tom Holland and RDJ have great chemistry. Their characters work very well together. CGI can he kind of hit or miss depending on the scene.

            "content": "Have found myself liking or loving a lot of Marvel's previous work, while finding a few faults with most. It is very easy on the most part to see why they are highly regarded critically, though those more critical of their work have raised criticisms that can be agreed with by me.\n\nLoved the first 'Avengers' film, while 'Age of Ultron' was more problematic and generally a lesser Marvel effort though still having a good deal to admire. 'Infinity War' for me was the best one, or the one enjoyed most. Would also go far to say it's one of Marvel's overall best, and a perfect example of how to do a superhero film and how to balance a large cast of characters and a lot going on. Can totally see why it has been so positively reviewed and it deserves the positive hype from personal opinion, though would hesitate in calling it flawless or one of the best films ever.\n\nMore could have been done with the very end, which felt like it ended a little too suddenly without resolving everything to full effect. It may very well have been leaving room for a follow-up, but to me it's always been dangerous somewhat to do that just in case a follow-up doesn't happen.\n\nScarlett Johansson also has far too little to do, with too short screen-time. Black Widow is the only character to me who felt underdeveloped and Johansson struggles to do much with it.\n\nHowever, the rest of the cast are spot on. A big shout out goes to Josh Brolin, who makes for a menacing and melancholic Thanos. Speaking of Thanos, Marvel have tended to underwhelm with their villains, underwriting them and giving them vague or inconsistent motivations. Thanos is easily one of the best Marvel villains along with Hela, one of the most interesting and of surprising complexity where he is a threat but one can see his point of view.\n\nRobert Downey Jnr, Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth are also standouts of a near-uniformly great all-star cast. There are a lot of characters here, but somehow on the most part it didn't feel like there were too many (a big danger with films with many characters and a trap fallen into quite a lot). They hold a lot of intrigue and manage not to be too sided and true to character.\n\nLikewise, the story is very eventful with a busy main story and several subplots. Yet it didn't feel sprawling and managed to make sense and never lose engagement. Basically it's a non-stop thrill-ride and tautly paced, with some reveals that leaves one gasping, twists that genuinely shock, rousing entrances and some of the finest action sequences of any Marvel film or any film recently, that are truly exciting and big in scale without being too noisy or exhausting. The climax is truly epic, in scale, spectacle, thrills and emotion.\n\n'Avengers: Infinity War' hugely impresses in the script too, with snappy banter, hilarious quips (along with 'Thor: Ragnarok' this is one of the funniest Marvel films, Thor has the best of it), tension and an emotional poignancy not seen to this extent or as strongly in Marvel films. It's all intelligently handled and the humour didn't feel misplaced or inappropriate to me, this is a Marvel film that delivers on the spectacle and thrills while also having brains and heart.\n\nMarvel never disappoints when it comes to the production values. 'Avengers: Infinity War' is not an exception. It's beautifully and atmospherically designed, slickly filmed and edited and the special effects, not overused or abused, are some of the most extravagant and spectacular for any film seen recently. It's tightly directed and dynamically and rousingly scored.\n\nOverall, an excellent film and one of my standout viewings of all the films seen so far from the first half, and overall, of 2018. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

He has a rational motivation for wiping out half the universe, and has the courage of his convictions. He shows humanity, despite being a giant, purple space monster. The ending, however, did not resonate as much as it should have. With half the MCU heroes being wiped out (though none of the ones who signed a four-film contract and leaving only about 70 Avengers for the next film), the audience should have been devastated.

Another extremely positive point is that, even though the film is long, there is not a moment when you disconnect, as the jokes are balanced, the dialogues are not tiring and the story is captivating. The film is an explosion of emotions, especially for fans.\n\nHonestly, I dont see any major downsides in the film. Everything fits perfectly. Not only that, but its a movie that manages to stand on its own, although its always better to watch the previous movies for a better experience.",

            "content": "This film was so highly anticipated that it seems like the creators felt like failure was impossible, and so over hyped after-the-fact that nobody wants to point out the obvious flaws.\nNow, if I decided to delve into every issue I had with the film, we'd be here all day, so I'll focus on my biggest gripes. These two things are crucial to get right if you want to make a quality film, especially a superhero film and ESPECIALLY one this ambitious. You can't sacrifice the basics.\nThe script, and the villain.\nThe script was cringe worthy from the very beginning. You could tell the actors were doing their best with what they were given, but unfortunately their efforts couldn't salvage it. Many lines and scenes felt superfluous and doused in gravitas without any substance to speak of, leaving me wondering if I was missing something. It seems like it would be difficult to make your characters sound like they're being over dramatic when the stakes are half the lives in the universe, but somehow this script succeeds.\nHowever, my absolute biggest gripe of the film was the flimsy, unsympathetic, one-dimensional and frustratingly melodramatic villain, Thanos. Now, I know for a fact that Marvel knows how to write a quality villain. You've got sympathetic characters that, under certain circumstances, you may actually find yourself rooting for like Helmut Zemo, Eric Killmonger, Ava Starr and (more recently) Black Widow's adaptation of Taskmaster. There are charismatic, campy villains that sacrifice relatability for entertainment value like Hela, Mysterio and (more recently) Agatha Harkness. There are tragic villains that compellingly surrendered to the lemons life gave them like Loki and (more recently) Wenwu. Even most of Marvel's villains who are just straight-up psychopaths have a fleshed-out motivation, like a lust for power or money (Ulysses Klau), revenge (Aldrich Killian, Ivan Vanko), or zealotry (Ronan, Kaecilius) to support and strengthen their character\nThanos has exactly none of those things. Maybe he'd be sympathetic if we knew more about him, but we don't. He's not charismatic, tragic or relatable. As a matter of fact, he has no clear motivation for his actions whatsoever, making the melodrama of his speech pattern unearned, incredibly grating and frankly hard to watch. I have no idea what gets him out of bed in the morning or what happened in his life to get him to this point. Maybe he's more fleshed out in the comic books, but if your movie has required reading in order to enjoy it, I'm sorry, you're doing something wrong.\nThis conundrum is further emphasized by the fact that his end goal doesn't make sense, and there are about a million alternative solutions available to the wielder of the infinity gauntlet to the problem of overpopulation that don't include genociding half of all life, yet he seems stuck on it for absolutely no reason.\nA good superhero movie is made or broken by the quality of the villain, and the whiny, superficial antagonist here was incredibly immersion-breaking. I didn't believe him. To me, he felt like nothing more than an overpowered, psychopathic, petulant child.\nOverall, I have to say, I expected a lot more from Marvel. The plot felt rushed and the interactions of the characters that don't typically interact felt clunky, lazily written, and at times felt like entirely different characters than the ones I've come to love.\nI genuinely don't understand how so many people claim to love this film so much. It was, simply, terrible.",

The actions of each character are completely justified, Thanos as the main antagonist is perfect, the reasons for which he acts are given and he gives more richness to the film.\nAnyway, you can not stay without seeing Infinity War, it is a good movie but I think it was enough for more, that if, this does not prevent you from enjoying it at all.",

Hamuru 8 parçaya ayırıp parçaların her birini güzelce yuvarlayın. Tezgahı ya da başka bir düz zemini bolca unlayarak hamurları tek tek açın. Tereyağını eritip hamurların üstlerine gezdirin. Hamurları dıştan içe doğru sararak rulolar yapın. Ruloları kendi etraflarında spiral olarak sarıp 10 dakika kadar dinlendirin. Dinlenen hamurları yeniden tabak büyüklüğünde açın. Tereyağını eritip içine suyu ve tuzu ekleyin. Yeniden donmaması için kısık ateşte bekletin. Hamurların her iki tarafını da yapışmaz tavada iyice pişirdikten sonra üzerine yağlı sudan sürün.

            "content": "Avengers: Infinity War is the fourth big group movie of the MCU, but it takes the big group concept to a whole new level with it's massive cast of characters. Basically every big actor in the MCU (with the exception of a few) is in this movie, making it a true culmination movie and appropriately so as its release year of 2018 marks 10 years of the MCU. Considering how many actors are in this movie, it manages to not squander any of them and give many of them moments to shine and funny lines. The movie has some of the most hilarious one-liners of the whole MCU, and is sure to give viewers a lot of laughs along the way. The film also raises the stakes to the highest they've been in any Marvel movie ever, which grips people with anxiety and doubt the whole way through and never lets them go. The action hits and rises above the standard set by its two predecessors by giving us fight sequences with a much bigger scale than anything seen in the previous two Avengers movies. Thanos is a much better villain than Ultron was because while his execution of his goals isn't great, his goals themselves aren't necessarily bad, giving us a villain who is multidimensional and complex and actually dealing with real world problems. This calls into question the meaning behind the Avengers conflict with him and whether or not there were other methods by which the conflict could've been resolved or Thanos could've achieved his goals. But even more, Thanos is an incredibly powerful being and one who could actually achieve his goals despite having to face the Avengers, which differentiates him from other compelling MCU villains. He is a threat that the Avengers haven't had to deal with so far and are not fully prepared for. Thanos manages to achieve his goals at the end, making him only the second in the MCU to do so and remain alive, Zemo being the previous one. This makes Infinity War's end truly emotional for fans of the characters and the characters themselves and creates a huge cliffhanger for its sequel. While there are certainly things Infinity War could done a better job of addressing, the movie redeems the Avengers franchise from Age of Ultron and should leave viewers satisfied yet wanting more as the credits roll.",

This 'God complex' he's become obsessed with has driven him to these insane measures due taking extremist viewpoints on finite resources within all the  planets across the galaxy. Any attempt to reason with him would obviously fall on deaf ears as he's also in this to wield the power that will allow him to execute the 'command' (snapping of his fingers with the gauntlet) that will reduce the universal population by 50%. No solitary person should have control of this type of power, yet it is a brilliant script for this movie and well executed with maximum tension until the very end of the film. The CGI work is very well done also,",

            "content": "It was only after the release of Infinity War that I got interest in MCU. Before that I wasn't very much into superhero movies. So a couple of months after this movie released, I skimmed through all the MCU movies from Iron Man to Black Panther. I didn't put much focus into watching them all, since most of them were just following one pattern. Iron Man? A guy gets superpowers, beats the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and saves the day. Captain America? A guy gets superpowers, beats the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and saves the day. Thor? A guy \"loses\" and then gets superpowers, beats the bad guy and saves the day. Even in The Avengers and Age of Ultron it's just \"now all those guys come together, beat the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and save the day\". But Avengers: Infinity War is very much different.\n\nThe movie begins from where the post credit scene of Thor: Ragnarok ended. Loki dies in the very beginning of the movie while he was trying to unsuccessfully deceive Thanos. This clearly shows that this movie really means business. It's not afraid of killing off the characters we have grown to like in all these years. Thor's hammer has broken so he gets a Mjolnir. Meanwhile Iron Man's team faces Thanos in yet another very brutal attack. Captain America's team is able to get out of their imprisonment after the events of Captain America: Civil War. And in spite of having a huge threat looming before them, Captain America and Iron Man still feel guilty of what happened between them previously.\n\nThanos is undoubtedly the biggest threat to have ever been shown in any Marvel movie, MCU or otherwise. Unlike the comics where he's just simping behind Death to show how many people he can kill, this time he actually has a motivation. And that motivation is so powerful he is even ready to sacrifice his own daughter for it. He has fought for many years to find the Infinity Stones, and there is no way that he will sacrifice his lifetime work over morals or ethics. Concepts like humanity, empathy, conscience don't hold him back anymore, as he was brought up by the Eternals and in spite of being treated as one of them, he chose to part ways. Mortals don't matter to him anymore. His ambition does.\n\nEvery scene from this movie is shot very well. The story, the colour palette, the choreography, the costumes, the score, everything is absolutely perfect. The only part I had a problem with earlier was when Starlord learnt about Thanos having killed Gamora and then he punches Thanos till he wakes up and is stopped. But later on I realised that Starlord has always been an emotional crybaby, and this kind of a behaviour is absolutely suited on him. He cannot be expected to think rationally, considering his track record in both the previous Guardians of the Galaxy movies.\n\nAnd finally in the end when Thanos snapped his finger, half the universe was gone. Even though we did know that they are all going to come back, the emotions that were conveyed by the characters clearly gave signs that something bad will surely happen in the end. I won't be getting into the spoilers because I want to keep this review spoiler free. So if you haven't seen it yet, don't just see who all disappear. Notice how they react when they disappear.\n\nAvengers: Infinity War is the kind of the Avengers movie I always wanted to see. I really don't like how The Avengers and Age of Ultron have aged so terribly (just like Joss Whedon's credibility lol) because of how campy they look by today's standards. Sure they did hold their legacy back then, but Infinity War will hold it for decades. It's the best MCU movie of all time.",

            "content": "Finally! After binging the previous 18, I've reached what are indisputably the best of the Avengers movies.\n\nAnd why are these last Avengers movies so great? Because they took the time to build the characters and worlds they inhabit over 10 years and 18 … freaking … movies.\n\nThe first Avengers movie impressed me mostly because of the fantastic job Joss Whedon (🤮 ) did in bringing six larger than life characters together with the requisite tension and witty dialogue, while delivering non-stop action.\n\nWhat the Russo brothers were able to achieve in Infinity War is frankly astounding. They did what the first Avengers movie did but with 21 of the main heroes which includes Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Black Widow, Hulk, Vision, Scarlet Witch, War Machine, Falcon, Star-Lord, Rocket Raccoon, Groot, Gamora, Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Doctor Strange, Spider-Man, Winter Soldier, Black Panther, and Nick Fury.\n\nThis doesn't include the excellent supporting characters of Wong, Heimdall, Okoye, Shuri, M'Baku, Eitiri, and Maria Hill.\n\nEvery scene that brings these characters together, especially those that haven't met each other before (Iron Man and Doctor Strange, Thor and Star Lord, etc.), or those that haven't seen each other in a while (Captain America and Winter Soldier), gave me goosebumps. All the personalities from their respective films are the same (Drax is still hilarious: \"Die blanket of death!\" after getting smothered by Doctor Strange's cape).\n\nThanos is probably the best villain in the MCU, toppling Loki. Josh Brolin does a great job making him a brutal and mildly sympathetic villain.\n\nAnd the number of locations they bring us to in all of its (4K HDR) glory is just insane: Earth (New York, Wakanda, etc.), Knowhere (Reality Stone), Vormir (Soul Stone), Zen-Whobiri (Gamora's home planet), Titan (Thanos' home planet), and Nidavellir (dwarven \"smith\" planet).\n\n100% of the credit can't be given to the Russo's. The writing, producing, special effects, and frankly all the teams involved deserve huge kudos.\n\nThe finale is essentially the last hour of the film. While it helps to have a $350-$400 million budget, it takes a perfect storm of all these teams working to pull it off. Multi-location action and drama.\n\nAnd the bitter ending after the snap. What really got to me here was T'Challa/Black Panther reaching out to Okoye and says \"This is no place to die\" then turns to dust. With Chadwick Boseman's passing that scene is just too real.\n\nJust wow.",

It's a great ride.\n\nLike 'Captain America: Civil War' did, 'Avengers: Infinity War' does an incredible job at juggling the gargantuan number of characters. It's ridiculous, but totally awesome, how many faces we see appear again. I thought they got the screen time for all, more or less, down to a T. Not an easy job, that.\n\nSpeaking of the cast, it's Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth and Josh Brolin who stand out most in my memory. Them three are excellent, especially the latter. Away from those lot, it's very cool to see all the other worlds - including from 'Doctor Strange' and 'Guardians of the Galaxy' - come together into one film. As for new additions, there aren't many - Peter Dinklage being the pick.\n\nThere are many references that I had already become aware of just via the internet, so it was quite amusing seeing them all unfold here and there. The effects looked great to me, as they have basically all the way up until this point of the MCU. The comedy is good again, also.\n\nNeedless to say, I can't wait to see 'Avengers: Endgame'!",

The film has the most varied set of locations I've ever seen in a film (We go from gothic spaceship to New York City to colourful spaceship to African paradise to mythic sun to barren wasteland) and the quick pacing makes the film very rewatchable. The huge, planet shattering finale is a true eye popper, and Josh Brolin as Thanos is defiantly the best Marvel Villian. Tom Holland as Spider Man and.Chris Hemsworth as Thor are always great, and the Dark tone is matched by a truckload of mostly funny jokes (there's a few misses). The runtime is justified, and the film serves as a guide to how massive cast films should be made. | Rating: A",

The sheer scale of it... The nostalgia, too, because we grew up watching these movies. We've been watching these characters on our screens for years. We've seen them grow and develop. I honestly think we will never get a series of interconnected movies like this in our lifetime. Who could even do it? DC tried and it didn't really work out. They were behind and they rushed it. They have a couple of good movies, but not like Marvel. And there's also the superhero fatigue to keep in mind. Maybe Disney could do this with Star Wars. There are also the X-Men movies. But I digress... \n\nI've seen the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe multiple times. I love all of the movies. They're very good as a standalone. But they're even better when you take into account the shared universe element. I genuinely believe Avengers: Endgame is peak superhero genre. It's the apex. We will never get a more epic superhero movie than that in our lifetimes. Maybe Marvel will hard-reboot everything in like 50 years, who knows... This has been an incredible journey. And I know Marvel will keep making movies, but I think it can only go downhill from Endgame.

Of course visually the film was magnificent but now 2 years on reading \"reviews\" and \"interviews\" and why we did this, that and the other (Poor Groot) I just didn't like THIS ending.

He doesn't quip like Ultron, he doesn't do evil stuff just to because he's a bad guy he does it because he has his own purpose of doing things. Thanos is the main character of this movie which makes sense considering the fact that we didn't know him that well in the past. His motivation is actually pretty compelling argument that could be talked about for a pretty good while. Thanos stoled the show every time he appears on screen. He literally demands your attention and you honestly have no choice but to listen to him and hear what he has to say. Even when you don't agree with his plan you still want to listen to him because he's that good of a villain. This movie is nothing but purely great and the only problem that I have with it is the scene where Thor gets his axe. It does feel long and could drag the film but even at that I still kinda enjoyed it because I am curious to see how Storm Breaker was made and I do find it interesting that Thor's hammer was made here as well. Also this film does go all over the place, however considering the fact that you're searching for cosmic stones you really have no choice but to do that. All in all this movie was dope. I can't recommend this enough. 10/10",

But rewatching it recently i realized that this movie is less about the plot and charecter archs but more about the action and all these charecters we have scene throughout the last ten years all teaming up and fighting against 1 man, 1 evil. And i think the derection the film went following Thanos was brilliant. Because having all of these charecters team up a massive cast its just not easy to make all these charecters feel like one team with each getting enough screen time. But following Thanos the bad guy getting all the stones just made it work out perfectly. Sure the snap did not have the effect on me like on others because i knew there would be a sequel it still sets up a the next story so well with such i stakes.

            "content": "AVENGERS INFINITY WAR sees Thanos (exquisitely performed by a regal Josh Brolin) finally being fully fleshed out as a character. In a way, he is the main focus of the film, and even managed to both make me tear up, and even made a certain amount of sense in his motivations. Like all great villains, he doesn't see himself as one, but instead as a saviour. He just has this conviction that living beings are overabundant and are slowly destroying the World, and that true peace can only be achieved by the elimination of at least half of them. I have to admit that there are days where I feel pretty much like he does.\n\nMost of the superheroes that populates the MCU appear in INFINITY WAR, with the notable exception of HAWKEYE and ANT-MAN (who I believe may end up in the sequel, because there WILL BE a sequel, judging from the decisively open-handed, shocking ending. ) and Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie, as well as the majority of the Asgardians who were aboard the spaceship at the end of THOR:RAGNAROK, are suspiciously absent. Have they fled before the attack by Thanos' brood that opens the film? Will their whereabouts be revealed in the sequel? Stay tuned.\n\nThis deluge of characters could feel overwhelming, but directors Anthony and Joseph Russo, who had demonstrated their uncanny ability to handle an enormous super-powered ensemble cast and outstanding action set pieces in their previous MCU entry, CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR, are in top form, accumulating show-stopping moments in a veritable orgy of mostly stunning special effects (Some of the CGI characters left me cold, but nothing to really take me out of the film.). There is little room for character development, although it can be argued that this feels very much like a season cliffhanger on TV. The character work had been done in the preceding season, so to speak, the same way we have seen those heroes evolve through 18 movies so far. By this point, we know them and their interactions clearly, leaving room for the villain of the piece to take centre stage.\n\nThis is not to say we don't get the now essential quips and character quirks, making new alliances entertaining and fun (Thor's team-up with The Guardians of the Galaxy is rife with humorous moments, for instance, making good use of Chris Hemsworth's talent for deadpan and Chris Pratt's natural braggadocio.), adding welcome moments of levity in an overall pretty grim premise.\n\nFans like me will rejoice in seeing Thor reacquire somewhat more traditional regalia, bringing him closer to his classic look than the one he sported in RAGNAROK. And isolated moments like the simply superb first appearance of Captain America (now having abandoned his star-spangled costume for a darker outfit, reflecting the disillusion he experienced after the end of CIVIL WAR), or his exhilarating race towards certain doom side by side with the Black Panther on the plains of Wakanda, are pieces of geek perfection.\n\nIs this the best Marvel movie? I wouldn't venture to go there. But there is no denying it is the most ambitious. Writer Warren Ellis has an interesting way to see it;\n\n''It is not a movie. It is a brand manifestation that wants to have prolonged, eager and reasonably skilled cultural sex with you. It wants your experience with its content™ to be satisfying and it hopes you are pleased enough to return for further interaction with the Brand. This is a very 21C thing. I like it for that alone, to be honest.''\n\nHe may have a point. In a sense, this isn't quite a movie. Not in the way we are used to experience them. Most films would try to at least be somewhat palatable or easy to digest for the uninitiated. This sensory overload of a motion picture caters strictly to the fans. A bright, loud shiny reward for the viewers who sat through the 18 previous films of the MCU, and who will keep sitting patiently through myriads of credit scenes for a glimpse at the promise of super-powered silver screen antics in the near future.\n\nIt exists as a gigantic cinematic anomaly, both wildly popular yet undeniably hermetic. One can hope that Hollywood doesn't attempt to learn the wrong lesson from its success, as it often does. Its success is not explained by the ridiculous amount of characters, or by its relentless succession of action sequences that ties together a somewhat fragile plot. It is not in the colorful cavalcade of CGI wizardry that fills the Imax sized screen to capacity.\n\nINFINITY WAR triumphs by expertly exploiting love for characters we have seen evolve on the silver screen over the span of the last 10 years, and for whom a vast majority of the viewers have shared a vested passion since Jack Kirby and Stan Lee decided to revive superheroes all the way back in 1961. It thrives on this affection that has spanned thousands of story lines, tons of ink, incalculable amount of coffee, and nearly 60 years of super-powered escapism.\n\nIt lives and prospers because it elevates its source material, both making it current while respecting its humble pop culture roots.\n\nTo paraphrase Gowan, Marvel movies are a strange animal I've got to follow.",

This is one of those Marvel films that anyone can enjoy, while the Russo Brothers also brilliantly utilizes all that we've learned in the past MCU films, to create the most cohesive, emotional, and high octane, story yet! The Russo Brothers utilized some of the best tones the MCU has set, to really enhance the emotion and tention in every scene. They put a great deal of heart into this film, but sometimes it got cut thin by the over abundance of jokes, that Marvel seems to think is necessary, every opportunity there is. The Russo Brothers had both hands on the wheel at all times, setting this fast, yet brisk pace, incorporating countless memorable scenes! There wasn't a scene that goes under appreciated, adding in tremendous risk, from the most menacing villain yet, but at times, it can feel a little clunky with the scene placement.\n\nWith this still being a story-based film, the characters moved the story really well, being the driving force of the film! While having all of these characters on screen at once, it's impossible to balance everyone equally, but the Russo Brothers were able to create so many amazing character moments, to get you really invested into what's going on, and not so much, what they missed. Even though they can step on their own toes at times, creating some inconsistencies and plot gaps, they still did a good job of understanding where these characters come from, and used them to their strengths. The cast as a whole does a great job, displaying seamless chemistry, even from some of the side and new characters.\n\nThe screenplay by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely, was very good overall. There are a lot more high points to the writing than bad, but there are still some forceful pieces of dialogue and jokes at times. Markus and McFeely have had their hands in most of these films, creating some hit or miss screenplays, but they put on their best work here.\n\nSo far, Infinity War undoubtedly has the best action sequences of the saga. The Russo Brothers crafted so many high octane action scenes, backed up by some amazing stunt work. The effects were done pretty well for the most part, but there are some points where you can tell they got lazy, and didn't completely polish things up as well as they could've.\n\nOverall, Infinity War is THE BEST film of the Infinity Saga, bringing these films to new heights!",

After Avengers 1, it seemed like Joss Whedon was the only one who could pull such a big team up film off. But Avengers: Infinity War takes it to the next level and incorporates 24 different heroes introduced in their own movies or franchises and manages to balance all the characters perfectly, so none of them feel unnecessary. It never feels overloaded, and every character has something to do. This was the movie that had been built up in the MCU for 10 years, and it certainly did not disappoint. Thanos is not just the best MCU villain, but one of the best comic book villains ever. This movie made the right decision by making Thanos the protagonist, not the antagonist. This is about Thanos and his mission to bring balance to all of life by eliminating half of it. While many may argue about overpopulation motivation being untrue in real life, it doesn't matter, as this movie is not trying to be a movie like Black Panther or the Winter Soldier. Thanos has a compelling motivation and we see exactly why he does what he does even though we don't agree with him. And he is menacing enough to pose a great threat to our heroes, as he defeated them more than anyone ever had before. Thanos winning at the end is one of the biggest surprises I've had. Seeing half of our beloved heroes that we've known for a while fade into dust is so shocking, and we feel the pain of the survivors, especially when Tony sees Peter Parker fade to dust in his arms. This movie redeemed made Gamora and interesting character and expanded Thor's amazing arc from Ragnarok. It also has amazing entrances from Captain America and Thor.

O personagem é humanizado desde o principio, apresentando um mistério, junto a uma calmaria que vem através da filosofia em determinados momentos. Isso já é o suficiente para desconstruir aquela famosa imagem do vilão forte, mas sem cérebro, ou louco e sem juízo - aqui fica claro o quão calculista e estrategista ele é. Ao derrotar todos facilmente, poupar a vida daqueles que não é necessário matar, e até ter uma ideia que az sentido a principio, mesmo sendo insana, já faz com que ele consiga uma certa admiração por parte do publico.\n\nA edição do filme é espetacular. Chega um momento onde tudo está acontecendo simultaneamente, e nada parece ser desperdiçado: na realidade, é tão bem montado que o filme parece durar uma hora. A obra é genuinamente engraçada, e sabe separar isso da atmosfera de uma maneira muito eficiente, já que a quebra vem em momentos inteligentes e aceitáveis. As cenas do Bruce falando com o Hulk são demasiadamente exageradas, mas nada que estrague a experiencia. Por outro lado, algumas são tão memoráveis que, além de virar memes, te fazem dar risada mesmo vendo pela quinta vez. \n\nA fotografia é belíssima. A OST segue o padrão de qualidade, mas com um claro destaque na que se refere ao vilão, que casa muito bem com seu perfil. Algo que não posso deixar de mencionar é o tempo de tela bem administrado, dando a sensação de que não fala ninguém - o que é um trabalho muito difícil num projeto com tal magnitude.",

            "content": "As a person who dies for consistency, Infinity War... didn't meet this standard. There were things that annoyed me such as the power stone blowing up an entire planet in Guardians of the Galaxy yet Thanos being incapable of doing this with four stones. Even if the power stone would've destroyed the time stone, Thanos could've just used the space stone to paralyse Dr. Strange and protect him from the blast and then force him to give up the stone. There were so many plot holes in this film; it could've been better. There were eye-pleasing action scenes, yet most of these were illogical to say the least and again full of plot holes such as the extreme variations in the power of Scarlet Witch, and given the number of superheroes with their various powers there was so much that could've been done but wasn't due to plot armour, and it's clear this was made for the cinema and not real life. Nevertheless, I don't care. I tried to love this movie at first but I then realised I was overestimating how awesome it was because I had been excited about it for five years since Age of Ultron, and I desperately wanted it to live up to my expectations. Thor was cool but he was an absolute plot device to subvert expectations and it did not fit with the previous rules that Ragnarok lay out for his powers, which was the far more interesting storyline. I tried to love this movie but something just didn't fit. I spent some time thinking about which parts didn't fit, and then I realised the only inconsistency in the MCU was this film. It is better than Dark World and Age of Ultron, but I don't enjoy movies unless they make sense given the premise and the laws the movies lay out for it, and that was what annoyed me. Despite having a few comedic relief scenes, the jokes aren't nearly as funny as I remembered. There were a few other things that bugged me, such as Robert Downy Jr's CGI suit looking very much like it was made of plastic in the New York scene. Gamora's death was sad, but almost every other death in this movie was severely inconsequential due to the obviousness of the storyline. This movie's plotline would've been amongst the most intriguing in a time when the Internet didn't exist and you could view which actors would be playing whom in the movie. Alas, now you can, and the effect is ruined because you know the characters will come back in the next movie like nothing happened. Don't use Ragnarok as a switchover storyline so you can give Thor a new axe- that should've waited a few movies - and certainly don't imply that such an axe can kill a being with all six Infinity Stones while its ancestor was crushed in the fist of a being less powerful. Thanos has all six Finity Stones, which can do absolutely anything your heart desires when you use them all together (which makes me wonder why one needs to snap their fingers at all) yet can't manipulate the laws of nature so he can fly and make himself worthy? I don't have the answer to this, but the inconsistencies and contradictions were so numerous it made it hard for my logic-seeking brain to enjoy this movie as much as I would've liked. The stones shouldn't have been aquired until much later in the movie, and during that time I would've liked it to be clearly shown what each stone does. We never got to see such a thorough thing from the time and soul stone. It seems that used on their own the stones do no more than give you strong superpowers, so unless you can give some consistent basis for how they work, such as using up the holder's energy, which it doesn't do considering how the stones were used as plot easy-win devices in previous movies, it kind of undermines the name \"Infinity\", doesn't it? 3 stars.",

And this is one of the funniest movies in the MCU and in my opinion surprising because it doesn't really seem like a funny movie. There is one scene that shows Thor's humanity and it is sad because he tells every traumatic thing that has happened to him since Thor. There is another scene that shows Dr. Strange knowing the future and it is pretty sad because he knows everything that happens in Endgame.\n\nOne thing that Marvel always gets right is the CGI they do such a good job at the Suits and the background in some planets looks so lifelike and Thanos the skin and the wrinkles on his forehead look so lifelike I'm surprised they made it look like that. Like I said in the previous reviews the acting is pretty solid in the MCU and I think they do a pretty good job in this movie and it has some of the best acting in the MCU, also the voice work for Rocket Raccoon is very good. Like I've said in the previous reviews to the score in each movie and especially this one is very good and the score really elevates so many scenes in this movie it just makes it so much better than it already is. The sound design in the blast and the infinity stones and all of the sound effects sound amazing in each movie and none of the movies really disappoint in the technical category. When Thanos snaps it is so sad because we lose beloved characters and it kinda a twist on the normal narrative in them winning in this movie they don't win and it is a very big twist. They do a good job of transferring tones for Thor in the MCU from funny to serious because of his loss and some people don't like the version of Thor in Endgame but I think it makes sense because of loss and guilt. This movie has some of the best action scenes in the whole MCU and they look so cool. The ending is very sad again because they just keep losing against this mad titan and they never win. Overall I absolutely loved this movie would recommend it to anyone.\n💯%",

            "content": "People naturally seek entertainment that fill the need for adventure and excitement, explains why comic movies became so popular.  They naturally fit the genre: heroes and villains, some with fantastic powers, told in a grandiose scale.  They are like modern version of myths from the past: from Gilgamesh to the Greek Gods.  In today's society with video games and technology in the mainstream, it's not just diehard fans consume this type of media.  Few exemplify this phenomenon like Avengers: Infinity War.  There were other comic book movies prior to this one, but none as successful.  \n\tOne of the creators were Stan Lee, who was famous for his comic book heroes such as Spider Man, which had its own movie franchise under Sony.  In 2008, Marvel Studios released a film titled: Iron Man, starting Robert Downey Jr.  It was the first film of over 23 films to start the Marvel Cinematic Universe.  These movies introduced heroes and villains; some heroes had trilogies. Ultimately, all the story arcs came together to a conclusion, which ‘Infinity War' is part one of two.  I have chosen to review the first film of the two-part conclusion, because it was the more interesting movie.  There were prior Avengers movies that brought a handful of heroes to the same screen, but Infinity War had quite a challenge to meet. There were over a dozen heroes to splint screen time and present a coherent story, and finally we get to see Thanos as the main villain.  \n\tThe Russo brothers directed this movie with Producer Kevin Feige at the helm, and they wrote a coherent movie despite the tremendous number pieces to cobble together.  The movie opens with the villain Thanos reveals himself, briefly there is brutal hand-to-hand action with the Hulk, showing Thanos' raw strength with the Hulk's easy defeat.  Thor revealed tearful emotion with the death of his brother Loki at the hand of Thanos.  \n\tThor came a long away from his original debut in 2011.  He was once arguably the most boring character, he was essentially one dimensional, he is depicted as proud and arrogant.  Although there is some change in his character through humility and willingness to sacrifice in the first movie, the depiction was a bit ham-fisted.  The second movie was even worse, where the character seems to just fight the bad guy and save another day.  The third movie was an interesting one, Ragnarok, changed the tone to an action-comedy, which played to the over-the-top absurdity of the movies we are used to watching.  In Infinity War, Thor is depicted as a King that lost its people, out for revenge.  His loss is enormous, and this is compounded by his experiences in the previous movie with the loss of his father and home world.  One of the best character development of the series.  \n\tBy contrast the Vision and the Scarlet Witch is far less developed. To be fair, they were minor characters with no movie of their own.  In this movie, they are suddenly a couple, trying to carve their own, normal life.  This wouldn't be an issue if they stayed as minor characters in the background beating up henchmen, but they play an important part at the end of this movie.  Creators squandered an opportunity to make an emotionally impactful moment for the audience.  They should have invested more with the characters or chose a different arc altogether for the climatic seen where Thanos turns back time to ultimately collect all six Infinity Stones.  \n\tMusic was produced by Alan Silverstri, who composed the score for The Avengers, and returned for the Infinity War.  The cinematic score was appropriate to the epic scale, and it brought back the iconic \"Avengers' Theme.\"  What stood out of course is the visuals, no doubt a movie of this scale would have the budget to create top notch visuals, but certain details need to be pointed out.  Transformation of actor Josh Brolin to Thanos is very subtle, it shows how far CGI effects come along since the early days.  The character has wrinkles, faded scars, even pores on screen.  Under certain lighting, it looks like flesh, perhaps made of rubber, but looks and almost feels like physical presence.  The CGI also aides in the action, from Thanos pulling a piece of the moon and to the explosions and graphic vistas are beautiful.  When are heroes and Thanos face-off on the fallen planet, the background is a space opera painting, in its dark orange hue.   \n\tFinally, the movie was a success by the strength of the actor to bring the main character to life.  I believe the main character is the villain, Thanos.  Josh Brolin played a complex character, whom had a twisted logic to his universe destroying plans.  Although he seemingly has no empathy to the billions he kills, but he does express guilt at times.  Particularly when he must sacrifice his adopted daughter, Gamora.  I was surprised by the scene; I didn't expect this kind of emotionality from this character.  He also seems cold, calculating, logical.  An example of complete control, which makes him a fierce opponent.  But here we can see a person who is torn by the choice he must make, certainly he made the same decision to kill before, but this time it affects him personally.  Is he shedding a tear for his daughter and himself or is he realizing the cost of this decisions he made before, and the suffering he caused others? \n\tMost of the movie follows a familiar arc, heroes find problem, seek to fix problem, finds a solution, and defeats the villain.  Thor even forges a new weapon and gain new level of power, classic tale of hero and weapon cliché.  However, this movie turns the expectations on its head.  Toward the very end, Thor buries his axe into the chest of Thanos, here we think that the villain is defeated.  But with a snap of his fingers, Thanos wins.  He escapes into the cloud and the heroes are left to watch as friends and loved ones fade away.  The bad guy wins.  \n\tThese are examples why Avengers Infinity War is not just another comic book movie.  The movie invokes questions like why he did this or that, you question the motives of the characters, rather than just watch them do it.  This movie is an excellent example of what a comic book movie could be, and worth your time to watch.",

As someone who had been following the MCU since its infancy, I was overjoyed at how all the heroes meshed so well together to face their most formidable foe to date. I felt that the Russo brothers selected the best groups of heroes to team up and found the chemistry between these rag-tag groups was off the charts. RDJ and Benedict Cumberbatch's deft interplay was especially entertaining as they vied for title of best Sherlock in the MCU. Their performances were especially impressive given the sheer amount of visual effects used throughout the film. And the visual effects, by the way, were absolutely tremendous. From the magnificent Dr. Strange and Thanos duel on Titan to the gorgeously rendered and realistic details of Thanos' being, Infinity War truly outshone all other Marvel movies as the most breathtaking work of cinema produced for any superhero movie. Josh Brolin's performance was excellent and lent a lot of humanity and sympathy to a character many saw as a psychopathic monger before this film. The choice to have Thanos' plan be one of perceived necessity and inevitability, instead of the hatred and resentment of Endgame's Thanos, truly lent an emotional weight to the character and his motivations. The ending of the film was also spectacular (if not just for the memes it spawned) and 'the dusting' remains one of the most emotionally impactful endings in superhero film history. Even if all those characters returned, it represented a monumental defeat for the Avengers and a beautifully dark ending that I have re-watched time and time again. Overall, this is the best MCU film and one of the best superhero films ever made.",

Josh Brllin does a good job of portraying him, he does what he can, but there was never one single time where I was intimated or in awe of Thanos. That and also the fact that there were just too many characters! The plot jumped around so much that every emotional beat was given hardly any time to resonate. But the best part of the movie, and the reason it's #22 on my list and not #23, is the ending. The ending was spectacular, with the dusting of the Avengers.

While Thor and Dr. Strange get some decent arcs, the villain is the only great character in the film. However, my biggest problem with the film is the story. With such an ambitious setup, you would think the film has a vast story. Instead, they have a person-goes-on-a-quest-for-a-valuable-object story that happens to be on a large scale with many characters. This can be done well like in Star Wars, but this film is sadly lacking any real story elements to make the action and characters compelling.

Wants more ethnic people critiquing her movies. So, where do white people fall into the \"ethnic\" part.  It's a diverse race.  It's of little wonder her co-stars couldn't stand her. (Please watch the interviews) Also used the movie as a platform to air her personal views on white men and also managed to irritate her colleagues. \nLook at the salaries of these actors.  They have increased yet again.\nExample:\nRobert Downey Jr. Served time in prison. Possession of weed, cocaine and heroin on multiple occasion and one possession of a pistol, whilst speeding whilst under the influence of drugs.\nAny average person wouldn't be allowed to travel, reputation in tatters no money. Interesting.  Also, if you make the smallest inference to his past during an interview he'll depart rather quickly in surprise.  \nFickle world.",

            "content": "Infinity war has to be one of the greatest science fiction movies of all time. Warning there could be some extreme bias in this. The movie to me didn’t seem like it would ever happen remembering back to when Thanos first appeared in 2012. Although the movie did not quite reach the hype it was built towards it is still quite the masterpiece. This movie is absolutely jam packed and to the naked eye could appear to be very mindless action filled science fiction nonsense. But in terms of superhero movies Marvel movies are very thoughtful in every piece of dialogue and interactions seen within their movies. Characters actually are complicated and interesting and not as shallow as many blockbuster movies make their characters. The complexities they exhibit allow for anyone going to the theater to identify with one of them if not all of them. Characters not only exhibit uniqueness but exhibit the very flaws that make us human. In other words they are not perfect and make mistakes that could impact others. Such as Thor’s selfishness in seeking revenge against Thanos, he cost half the universe. Or in Peter Quills grief he caused them to not get the gauntlet from Thanos. Along with the absolutely essential story Thanos is given within this film that makes this giant purple cgi being actually believable as something that thinks feels and breathes. Not only that but it is not mindless evilness that makes Thanos a villain. It is complex in that he does what he believes in his big ego he is a savior. Many could even argue he is the hero of the story. They give Thanos many facets and complexities within the already packed film and that in itself is an achievement. This movie has an enormous number of characters and every second of time a character has spent on screen is not wasted. Every section in which characters interact or a character and the reflects helps move the plot forward and it’s absolutely beautiful in the way that it accomplishes this. It fits together perfectly almost like a shirt that was baggy on you last year. That’s where this movie does struggle a little bit in that there isn’t much time to develop arcs for characters and give them development and may feel rushed. It can be so fast moving at some points it’s hard to catch a breath while watching it. Most of the film despite this does a pretty good job of developing characters and relieves the pressure of a jam packed film with comedy. It ends on a perfect note that either leaves the audience devastated or seeking more or both. Every little bit of this film connects and interacts with one another making a beautifully done story and action sci-fi film. ",

And, SPOILER ALERT, they give Thanos exactly what he wants, basically handing him gems he's searching for. When anyone suggests that they hide, run, try to figure out a plan, or do anything pro-active, they all have some mumbly sort of excuse why they shouldn't. So, they basically just do stupid things to continue the plot. I wish the writers took a little more time to construct a plot in which the heroes at least tried to use their minds. They had me rooting for Thanos. After 40 minutes of The Avengers' Three Stooges imitations, I really saw Thanos' point of view. Besides that, its a fun romp around Universe.",

Thor has the best story arc in this film as he is suffering from the (SPOILER) death of Loki at the beginning and the fact that he is out for revenge so he needs a \"Thanos killing\" weapon..... Stormbreaker. Plus his entrance into Wakanda... is a YES moment, will also gives you chills. The banter between Tony and Dr. Strange is great to see throughout the film.

It's not pretty - I mean, it IS pretty visual effects-wise they pulled no punches (especially the motion capture of Josh Brolin as Thanos), but there's a lot crammed into Infinity War and I think it's the best it could be. First off, it should really be labelled as Part 1, because this is not a full story. This movie ends at Act Two and you just have to wait for Endgame for the rest. There's no part of you that expects what happens at the end to stay final, so it takes a bit of that drama away. That being said, the film is typical Marvel fun - seeing all of our heroes meet up and interact is fun. Some are drastically under-utilised (our friends in Wakanda) and some are at their absolute best - Chris Hemsworth plays Thor at his lowest so well and still with his boyish charm and perfect comic timing. Highlights  were Dave Bautista as Drax and Pom Klementieff as Mantis, Paul Brittany as Vision and Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda were a lovely little port in the storm, and even Thanos, himself, has a dramatic calm. Thanos is a villain you don't agree with, but his calm self-assured martyrdom makes you think about his position more than most baddies. Infinity War can not be viewed as a stand-alone film, but for the fans the only disappointment is that you have to wait for Endgame to know how it all truly ends. ",

Thanos is mortal so this would have worked, if not for the reality stone. The plot hole comes in around 1 hour 50 minutes in.

            "content": "Avengers Infinity war was the most watched movie in 2018, because let's be honest, everyone saw this movie, and apparently everyone liked me, personally, when I left the cinema I felt confused in the sense that I had to ask the question \"Did I like it?\" The truth to answer this question I had to see it again, maybe not at the cinema, but I did it at home, I analyzed it and came to the conclusion that if I liked it, but that does not mean that I loved it, I simply prefer movies as the first of \"Avengers\", \"Ironman\" or even \"The Winter Soldier\".\n\nWell, if you're a marvel fan, before you explode in anger, I want to remind you that I'm not saying that the movie is bad, I'm just saying it's not the best. Why? It's simple, the movie is very complicated, such as that they could beat Thanos very easily, like cutting off his arm with the portals of Dr. Strange, or that Dr. Strange does the infinite cycle as he did with Doormamu, well I think it is written like this, but that does not matter, the point is that if Doormamu a million-year-old celestial being got bored, Thanos by logic, simple would also get bored and agree to its terms, but the movie is not very complicated and they make complex plans so that in the end one of them spoils him (Star-lord), or that the film is complicated more also with that sub-plot of Thor in search of a magical dwarf to make his ax, and the problem is here, at Thor Ragnarok we were taught that Thor is not the god of hammers, but that this is the god of thunder, therefore he does not need a weapon to defeat his enemies, but here the film is overlooked, and contradicts herself by telling us that Thor alone It is going to be able to defeat Thanos with that Ax, which, as I said, contradicts what they told us in Ragnarok, or that of the end that everyone vanishes, I wonder \"Am I supposed to get sad for them? The answer is no, because it is more than predictable that they would return, seriously the people who cry with it, make me sad.\nNow I'm going to talk about how good this movie has and I want to start by saying that it's just great to see all the mcu superheroes together in a movie, which I have to recognize the writers and directors that for a movie with so many characters did not not bad, to tell the truth unlike other marvel movies, this one has a good villain, that would be Thanos, that has an interesting story, and a justifiable reason, that if you analyze it logically the true villains of the movie specifically the avengers , to avoid the salvation of the universe, to tell the truth the battles are good, the action is entertaining, and maybe previously I said yes, it is very predictable that the characters that disappeared will come back, but if there were some that did die of Truth like Loki and Vision, I hope they do well and leave them dead. I dare to say that the best of this movie is its ending with the winning villain, something we had never seen in a marvel movie. Personally I would have liked more is that this would have been the last film of the mcu, nothing like an unexpected ending with the villain won and with half of the population \"dead\", but I would only add something else at the end, to give an end to each character that survived, for example a scene that Tony Stark stays in the lost space forever, the heroes of the earth admitting that Thanos was right, or something like that I loved, because apart marvel was done doing the favor to close with a flourish, because the movies that have been released after this one are simply not good, \"Captain Marvel\" is the typical original movie, with an annoying protagonist and the movie ends up being boring, Ant-Man and the Wasp It is more of the same, with a villain with silly motives, many things that lack meaning, excess of humor, the movie is very bad, Avengers Endgame is not bad, but neither stands out in any way, the hour of time is boring rid to, and you already talk about this movie in a separate review, and we get to the last movie that Marvel has taken out that it would be Spider-Man Away from home and this movie is bad, the plot is more than predictable, the villain has again a silly and repetitive motive, excess of humor, love is silly and forced, Spider-Man is a fool in this movie, please enlighten me and please tell me what this movie is good about, because everyone I know love that movie.\nWell back to the topic Infinity War is one of the great events in the history of superhero movies and I am not sure if it is correct to say of cinema in general, with great battles, with one or another thing that does not make much sense, but a good Villain, this movie earns its 7/10.",

Marvel really chose well inviting the Russo brothers back to direct probably the biggest comic book movie ever in terms of scale, they translated their success of Cap 2 and 3 onto a far wider spectrum of characters and locations without losing the same kind of tone the MCU had set up over the preceding 10 years, and the writing as well was just outstanding; they managed to make Thanos the central character in an Avengers movie, whilst not taking the focus too heavily off of the Avengers, despite them essentially being a supporting cast. More than that though, they made Thanos compelling and multi-layered, you can almost empathise with his motivations, despite the misguided manner in which he executes them, and the expectation subversion in the end just makes for a truly great piece of tragic storytelling, leaving us crushed yet simultaneously satisfied and wanting more. Visually the whole film is utterly gorgeous, all of the shots in space and on other planets are all individually distinct, and feel like separate entities to the more familiar setting of Earth, Vormir in particular is utterly breathtaking. And my god does Alan Silvestri know how to write an amazing score, manages to get you pumped, break your heart and make you fear the worst in equal measure, how he didn't get an Oscar nod for this film I will never know! If you're not a die hard Marvel fan there may be elements of the film that'd be slightly lost on you initially, such as who Thanos is, or what happened at the beginning with the Asgardian ship, what Xandar is, how the infinity stones have been woven into the universe, etc, but actually for the most part I don't think you would be completely lost, even if this was your first MCU film, as I feel it does just enough to give new viewers enough information, whilst not boring those of us who had seen the prior 18 films with details with which we were already very familiar. I am still quite surprised that critics are so torn with this film, and I feel like the simple truth is they're spending too long judging it as a standalone movie, which really isn't the point of the film, it had a lot of buildup over 10 years, and also set us up for more, two more films were impliedly the end-credits scene alone. For me whilst Endgame is far more discernible as a three-act epic, Infinity War I feel is a better film in spite of what the critics say, it just has better general pacing, it doesn't slow down too much yet at the same time manages to keep in control despite the gargantuan number of characters in play, and the cliché dodge at the end really makes it stand out amongst other entries in the MCU.",

Then the heroes try to fix all and save the people who could die in the war, the heroes join forces then start the team work but this is more than war; they can show us the world in a different way to see everything, like how the humans are ending with all of our nature, with all what we want and we believe in a past that it will be forever, but that`s only the start of this, the heroes try to save what we know, I think that the message it`s really clear and we have to take care about the world, we have stop to think only in war, stop to think in bad choices, and start to make the change.\nFor the kids it is going to be really interesting and appropriate, in my opinion everybody has to see this movie to understand the good action, the soundtrack makes you feel in the story and you are going to feel a really hero after see this amazing movie.

Prior to and during the viewing of this film, I can't shake this feeling that this whole movie simply revolves around the Thanos snap. And everything has to fall in line no matter how irrational or illogical it may sound in retrospect. So for no apparent reason, bruce banner suddenly can't turn into hulk. And for no apparent reason, Doctor Strange suddenly forgot that he could just rewind time when Thanos has the upper hand.\n\nI dunno. Maybe I didn't read the original comics or story because it's way before my time. Maybe all of it makes perfect sense in the original script. But it certainly didn't make any sense in the movie. All of it seems like all set in motion to create this clash between the heroes and the god-like Thanos. At the cost of sensibility. And stripped of the thrill of that final clash, since the movie is clearly building up to the snap, this movie is nothing but a lot of flares and grunting. Pardon my language, I think I could say the same for some pornography, but at least there'd be some action in it.",

Sad to not see Hawkeye or Ant-Man in here, but the movie is able to balance out every character and give them their deserved time before the biggest shock of all time at the end.  To top it all off, Thanos is the perfect villain and he is far better than Endgame's Thanos.  The one here is basically the protagonist if you watch it from his POV.  ",

This movie downplayed Thanos to just an ordinary villain rather than the ultimate enemy to all sentient races like for example; Thanos was a Deviant of supreme power with a vast amount of knowledge, possessor of the cosmic cube and is culmination of Marvel's magic characters. He also has an obsession with death and even the physical manifestation of death to the point of wiping out half the universe to gain her affections.

These characters are also all pitted against mirrors of the MCU, matching powers of the villains and heroes is a great touch. The movie, while making a small amount of jokes, hit each one on the head. While the jokes are few, the witty banter between similar characters provide for wonderful interactions and introductions. The fight scenes are epic and the adventure of Thor provides from a good break away from the other two plots. Each plot has a different setting which allows for great contrast in background between blacks, oranges, and greens. Overall good action packed movie.",

A product of its own ambition, the only real fault of the film is the sheer number of characters, arcs, and many other things going on at once that make it difficult to fully appreciate how detailed and payed off McFeely and Markus' writing, as well as the Russo brothers' directing, really are. \nThough a big enough chunk of its enormous cast of thirty plus characters don't get their due, many favorites like Captain America and Black Panther included, a bigger percentage do, often even improving upon their solo movies. Doctor Strange, Iron Man (RDJ acts circles around everyone), Vision and Wanda's love story, and particularly Thor excel against the film's appropriately dark, somber tone. But it's the brilliant use of Thanos (a tip-top Josh Brolin) as the film's protagonist, along with rejuvenated motivations for the Mad Titan's spiritual quest for balance, that really seal the deal.",

The only drawback to this film, for me, was that your enjoyment of it will be highly dependant on how many of the main marvel films you have seen previously. You may not be as moved as you thought you were going to be if you go into this thinking it will just be an epic action movie, its heavily dependant on the ongoing plot of the franchise. 4.5/5.",

Thanos is a great villain, he probably ranks in the top five best in the MCU, I just wanted to point that out. So, a cool premise, but there was so much going on in each scene that your mind won't get a break; it was kind of a small clusterfuck. Since there was just so much shit going on, there were some characters who got enough screen time and some with little. The action was good as usual, with some well-choreographed scenes and visual effects. There were some funny scenes that were actually funny so that was nice, but I never got a heart-warming scene like some movies. Since this is technically a \"Part 1\" it ends with a cliffhanger that leaves you both anxious and a little confused. I do give the movie credit, there were some parts that made me raise my eyebrows, but disappointingly not jaw-dropping. So, I'm just going to stop it here, this will be too long of if I keep talking about it. Overall, it's a solid entry in the MCU but not without its flaws. I still enjoyed it anyway, I never looked at my watch due to boredom or curiosity. That being said, I'm excited for Avengers 4 and very curious on how they'll end it.",

The first scene in the movie is the best. Even with just a silhouette, he appears stronger than anyone in that scene and then what he does.\nSecond best scene would be the Forge Stormbreaker scene. Beautifully done to show where Mjolnir was forged and how Thor gets his new weapon.\nAnd the scene where Stark is losing Spidey (Holland).\nWakanda scenes are good and enjoyable.\nRest of the scenes are done well.\nNow, the quibbles. Story needs to be more robust, and/or a bit of tweaking. I know, I know, everybody is a screenwriter, so I won't mention any story ideas which I do have. But basically its Thanos' quest for the infinity stones and what he does with it.\nGive him something to worry about..\nAlso, some of the jokes may come at the wrong time... After Peter Quill and group found Thor, don't have him joke around.. he just lost everything.. Thor opens up to Rocket, but not until a few scenes later..\nI can go on and on.. but hey, everybody is a critic.\nBottom line.. good and enjoyable movie..",

Plus everybody loves when they collide movies and shows. So of course, everyone wants to see all the heroes get together. Also this one isn't focused on the avengers winning all the fights they makes this one realistic. When I say that I mean they heroes can't win every time right?  \n\nLike I said everybody loves seeing all the heroes work together in one epic movie, Im sure you've seen the other avengers and marvel movies. So you should know Thor, his brother loki and their enemy Thanos who they are trying to stop in this movie.  We have all the big legues like iron man, hulk , captain America, spider man, even the black panther made an entrance in this film. We got our comedian characters like groot, rocket, drax, peter (star lord) gamora and lets not forget nebula. Then we have Dr. Strange he is one of the holder of the infinity stone The whole point of this movie is them working together to try to stop the almighty thanos.  \n\nRight from the jump they throw you in the mix where thanos hijacks thors ship and tried to take one of the stones he need to be the most powerful villain. That's when Dr.strange knew thanos was coming to earth. Even thanos children are powerful they had iron man and all the avengers trying to fight them off. It isnt even all action there's cute scenes like when gamora and star lord start forming a romantic relationship. That's not the only memorable scene for gamora, she was the one to shank thanos thinking she finished it even though it was hard for her because thanos was the one to look after her. There are just so many curve balls that they throw at you. One epic part was when thors hammer broke and groot made a handle for him and he did some major damage and it saved his life.  \n\nOf course, in every movie there will be things you don't necessarily like. In this one there wasn't much because it's a great movie but after all they did to fight him off they still didn't succeed I mean I get they have to lose some time but come on, everyone was in. That's the thing I like though how great they work together. It shows you sometimes you must make sacrifices for the greater good. They aren't people just trying to save the world they turned into a family , Its just a great mix.  \n\nNow this is why I loved the movie because its not just action there's other themes all mixed In.  I hope after reading this you watch the movie. I left out so many great scenes you should really find out how it ends. You wont regret it",

Thanos is brilliant, and Brolin's voice and demeanor was a perfect choice for the character.  The performances are solid throughout, and most characters capitalize on their opportunities to make an impact on the audience.\n\nThis film is emotionally poignant, exciting, and truly unique.

The visual effects are amazing that easily bring out the light on its over-blown budget. The action that is on display was enticing and epic. Plus, Josh Brolin absolutely nails it as Thanos. Creating the most intimidating and complex villain this cinematic universe has ever seen. However, this movie is way too overstuffed. There's too many characters to keep track of, and all of the different plot points don't really flow well together. Also the ending at the end was the absolute worst. Killing off many characters without setting up the final chapter is just mean and filled with greedy ambition. A lame way to force everyone to watch Endgame, as you kind of know how its going to end. It does deserve positive credit, but not a lot of love and critical acclaim.",

The challenge with films like this is the emotional connection can spread thin. On that front I think the action sequences help but would have preferred a bit more favor to strong dialogue over pure action especially for second or third viewings of what is a solid film. The only other thing is I am not a fan of are two or three part films made for the sake of purely milking the masses. I am not yet convinced that this story and the conclusion could not have been told better as a single film especially given the length of just one of them.
