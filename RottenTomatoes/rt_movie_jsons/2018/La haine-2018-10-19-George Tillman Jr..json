The uneasy balance between these worlds is soon shattered when she witnesses the fatal shooting of her childhood best friend at the hands of a police officer. Facing pressure from all sides of the community, Starr must find her voice and decide to stand up for what's right.",

            "content": "Performances and writing for this film were done very well. The movie is very interesting. Film depicts what is happening in the USA consistently showing a girl coming to illogical conclusions about the murder of a friend by a cop. Instead of focusing on the faults of her murdered friend and her own community, she rather blame white people and police. Illogical racial paranoia takes over and she alienates herself from her white friends. Thus, nothing becomes better for anyone. Which depicts real life. This movie needs to be seen by all.",

Everyone in this film did a fantastic job when it came to dialogue and acting. It's almost like the Director knew how to grab us and have tons of feel through the movie. To be honest this legitimately felt like I was watching a Spike Lee movie with how realistic and true this film is.",

But as a movie, it isn't that good. I would say it's pretty average, however, the book is a great alternative and for someone who read the book first if you're thinking about watching the movie, read the book. The movie leaves out a lot of the book's important scenes and changes the ending pretty drastically. However, the movie has good morals but is pretty unrealistic, so read the book and if you think you'll like the movie then just watch it.",

The movie was the best when it was tackling subjects about all sides of police brutality and how others think they know what people are going through when they really don't. It made me think more about how I approach considering what other races have been through. \nThe movie does fall into a lot of problems that other young adult movies do. It felt very cheesy in some scenes when there was genuine emotion that was supposed to be felt. The acting was just okay and I feel if it was elevated a few degrees more than the movie would had as big of an impact as the creators were hoping. The film isn't bad at all but doesn't tao into too many new areas as far as young adult innovation goes. I had some moments during this film where I really did feel strong emotions and a deep understanding for what the characters were going through but they were often cut too quick. If the movie could have paced itself a little differently and really made us hold onto moments longer like when Khalil di d it would have done more for me. The highschools rama aspects had an extra little element in them with the focus being on racial equality but characters emotional moments didn't have quite the punch I would've hoped for. \nOverall this is a very enjoyable movie and one that I think everyone should watch. It makes you think more about important issues that a lot of people have become far too polarized on.",

The reason I gave this movie 4 stars are, the subject matter, the way it is portrayed and shown. This movie had truly my hamsters spinning and drew me in from start to finish. When I first started to watch the beginning, I almost changed channel because I felt it was just another movie that used \"racism\" as a reason to be. But I quickly changed my mind and was drawn in within the first few mins and in the end, was happy I did so. This was a \"Powerful and vulnerable\" movie at the same time. Meaning that it was powerful in showing the truth in our times and in the same instant, showing how vulnerable the black community is in regards to prejudice and all it entails. If I was to continue my critique of this movie, I'd end up writing a book instead of a review. So, I'll just say and encourage everyone/anyone to watch this movie as it is well worth your time. And I guaranty you, that it will leave you thinking on many many issues that you've heard and/or witnessed in your lifetime from Rosa Parks, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr and all others who tried to eradicate racism in their own way, from Abraham Lincoln and everyone else in between up to this day.",

            "content": "The YA movie has been a much more prominent form of a film over the last decade or so. We have had the boom of the Nicholas Sparks' book adaptations, featuring young people in love, which had started majorly with the release of the Notebook in 2004. Combined that with the sub-genre of YA with Post-Apocalyptic world stories, kicking that craze off with the release of The Hunger Games in 2012, starring Jennifer Lawrence. The Hunger Games was such a huge success, that sequels followed, which tied with their source material and a handful of franchises that based their plots around young, predominately teenager characters in life or death situations in a dystopian world, such as The Maze Runner and Divergent franchises.\n\nThe YA genre is certainly not original and has over time covered different types of stories centred on ‘Young Adults', but the question is whether any filmmaker or writer can bring anything fresh to the table. The film in question is this movie starring Amandla Stenberg, who had also starred in a post-apocalyptic YA film called The Darkest Minds, so she is in familiar territory. Based on a novel by Angie Thomas, the film stars Amandla Stenberg as Starr Carter, a young black girl who lives in a poor neighbourhood but attends an upper-class school, sent by her parents (played by Regina Hall and Russell Hornsby).\n\nHer parents have a clear radical past and her dad enforces on his family to believe in themselves and stay tough in a cruel, hating world, which stays within Starr. When she attends a party, she bumps into an old friend Kahlil, and gunfire is drawn, and the party members disperse. Kahlil drives her back home only to be pulled over by a police officer who assuming Kahlil carried a weapon, open fires and kills him, leaving Starr to look on in horror. The family are told the policeman won't be charged unjustifiably pending an investigation, Starr understandably becomes appalled and confused at this injustice.\n\nWhile mourning the loss of her friend, Starr and her family's life spiral completely out of control, as the media and outraged citizens of the black community turn Kahlil's death into a call to arms. Her school life is affected as her fellow classmates use his death as an opportunity to protest in order to skip class for that reason only. There is a subplot involving her uncle (played by Anthony Mackie), a gang lord who want to hurt her family after she reveals her family's past to a news presenter and so her dad dangerously slips further and further back into the world he once occupied in order to protect his family from harm's way. Starr tries desperately to cope with her grief and the ensuing madness around her, as she finally decides after all what she knows is right and has to say.\n\nThe film and, it's source material deal with heavy and topical subject matter, and to approach this story from the perspective of a young teenager is interesting but also important; a lot of what happens not just here and, in the world, today, influences younger people and shapes their lives. First and fore-most Amandla Stenberg is just amazing in the role, she brings a mature but powerful and subdued performance that vastly dominate the proceedings. What we know from her world point is clear from her portrayal as Starr and effectively shows us the anguish and confusion that her character goes through, as it seems like the whole world is against her.\n\nRegina Hall and Russell Hornsby are also very good here, never giving in to over-acting or melodramatic gestures that might hinder the film. The film tells this story but never at the expense of great characterisation or subtlety. I think it is an important film that should be seen by not just young people on their own but with their families with which could generate important conversations. The message is timely, relevant and never feels the need to look down on young people or needing to wander into a melodramatic contrivance to make its point. It isn't an easy film to watch nor should it be, George Tillman Jr. the director, who has experience tackling young demographic aimed material before, most notably the Nicholas Sparks adaptation of The Longest Ride and it's to his credit that he understands the message of the source material, and has a confident hand to get great performances out of his cast very well.\n\nThe film proves there is life to be had in the YA genre and room to tell engaging stories for younger people that are effective, raw and honest and acts as a befitting swan-song to screenwriter Audrey Wells.",

With his fourteenth feature, director George Tillman Jr. crafted an astonishing adaptation of Angie Thomas' best-selling YA novel. Using captivating cinematography, Tillman Jr. draws viewers into the world of an African-American teenager coping with a tragic loss. From intimate close-ups to stunning establishing shots, the cinematography keeps viewers immersed in the film's suburban setting. Audrey Wells' screenplay is also spectacular, and expertly uses voice-over narration to place viewers into the perspective of a grieving black teenager. In terms of acting, the entire ensemble is at the top of its game. Amandla Stenberg delivers a star-making performance as Starr Carter. With riveting expressions, she conveys the curiosity, determination and righteous anger of a black teenager that fights racial injustice in her town. The supporting cast, which includes the heartbreaking Russell Hornby, is also excellent and worthy of recognition. Although \"The Hate U Give\" is undeniably unforgettable, ultimately it is not a flawless film. Its story is slightly conventional, and follows the clichés of the genre. Moreover, it builds to a heavy-handed conclusion that sugarcoats the realities of racism. Nevertheless, fans of the beloved book will definitely enjoy \"The Hate U Give\" and so will movie-goers seeking enlightening entertainment. In the wake of the recent Black Lives Matter Movement, it's a timely reminder of the never-ending wars against racial injustice that African-Americans continue to fight today.",

As I read the book in days and watched the movie right after, it was fresh in my memory. \n\nI felt the book worked better not because books are always better than adaptations but because the dialogues and narration was really strong but in movie significant changes in every scene, bigger or small made it entirely different. It's a rare adaptation which has same scenes, characters, and story but rewritten with new dialogues made it bit different. \n\nPeople who loved the book, should like the movie too but people looking for others (cops) point of view this movie or book is not about that it's about a point of view which rarely gets to be seen or read.",

Star lives in Garden Heights which is not such a good community, but attends a private school which is predominantly white. At the beginning of the movie Starr witnessed her best friend being shot and killed by a police officer. Starr has to decide if she should stand up and tell her story. \n    It touches on a very controversial topic, the shootings of unarmed African American men by law enforcement. If you watch the news you would know that the media tends to completely avoid these topics or to sugar coat them. Whether you believe that law enforcement has their reasons for these actions or not, this movie will give you a different perspective. This movie sheds light on this issue and gives people a chance to educate themselves on this topic. This movie can be compared to many real life situations that involved unarmed African Americans and law enforcement; Trayvon Martin, Micheal Brown Jr., Eric Graner, and, Korryn Gaines.\n    This movie also confronts issues that interracial couples may face. Starr lives a completely different life as her boyfriend Chris. Chris is a wealthy white boy that goes to the same private school as Starr. Despite Starr's worries about what people might think, Chris does not care. Starr learns how to trust Chris and lets him get to know the real Starr. Interracial couples face many questions like \"What will my family think?\" which is a problem Starr faced in the movie and overcame.\n    All though the movie is about a very serious topic it still has some humorous elements. One scene could be heart wrenching and the next could be amusing. This movie does a good job at balancing these emotions. From the beginning of the movie till the end you develop a connection with the characters.",

What's especially impressive is the movie's capacity to skewer liberal racism and crap like 'all lives matter' without resorting to straw men. It shows us that the oft-quoted call to 'speak truth to power' is easy and relatively uncostly for the privileged (like me); it's somewhat more painful and expensive for those who suffer under's power's heel.

In the movie,The Hate U Give, discusses how often we individuals are victims who are afraid to speak because if you snitch you put others lives in danger, but if you dont speak your truth then becomes hidden. Tupac said that we fall victims of our own minds. Tupac believed that the condition we live in is not because we want to be this way but because we have a choice. We fall victims of our own minds because the conditions we live in sets us up to failure. A lot of times people get caught up in the struggle and fail to find a way out\n\nThere are movie scenes that demonstrate Tupacs belief. Starr had to turn in the king lord to save her family. Starr had to testify at her friend that was murdered by the police at the court hearing. Starr had a chance to a better way of life because she had a choice. Starr had a chance to speak out during a community protest as a star witness to his friends death. Starr defended herself when she said no to violence as she protected her youngest brother from being shot. Starr biggest conflict was to admit that it was a mistake to say that the police were not the blame for what had happened to her \n\nI was an active advocate in a chapter of black lives matter on its campus? I no longer belong to a chapter after 2012. I wanted to get involved after being overwhelmed with unarmed boys dying in the news. I became more aware that it could happen to anyone, even me. Trayvon Martin and Micheal Brown story shocked me because of how they died and how it happened at their age being so young high school students. The people involved, victims of families or the victims themselves who are apart of the movement to speak in behalf to those who cant.",

            "content": "The film The Hate U Give, directed by George Tillman Jr., is a must-watch, call-to-action film that will bring tears and smiles to any audience. \n\nThis film depicts the life of the young girl, Starr (Amandla Stenberg) and how she finds her voice and her purpose after having watched her childhood friend Khalil (Algee Smith) get shot and killed by a cop, who is referred to as 115 throughout the film (Drew Starkey). This movie features so many three-dimensional characters, to a point that you almost forget each character is only a role in a movie, like Starr's white boyfriend who serves as her lover, protector, and biggest conflict. And even though The Hate U Give is such a soul-bearing film, there are still moments of laughter and wholesome family moments.\n\nMy favorite part of this film is the scene when gets into an altercation with her \"friend\" Hailey (Sabrina Carpenter). Starr pulls a brush out of Hailey's book bag and asks if it looks like a weapon. Then, she waves the brush around as if she is holding a weapon and yells at Hailey to get down on the ground before she shoots her with the brush. At this point, Hailey is on the ground crying. This scene alone directly speaks towards the talent of both actresses, Sabrina's character looks so devastated and scarred, and she only communicates these emotions through subtle body language. Amandla's character is fueled by so much rage, and she directly shows this anger through the way she's recklessly waving around her \"weapon\".\n\nThe Hate U Give is very relatable to every audience in every aspect. Frank Fleming, without a doubt, makes each and every outfit not only appropriate for the modern setting, but also appropriate for the personality of each character. Season Kent controls the audience's mood swings from one scene to the next with an amazing soundtrack that I even downloaded.\n\nThere is no scene or part of this film that I did not enjoy. However, I did feel some strong feelings when Starr is told that after she gives her testimony, that officer 115 was not indicted for the murder of Khalil.  \n\nI give this film 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to18, as well as adults. This film is available now in theaters so look for it. \n\nReviewed by Raquel Y., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews by youth, visit kidsfirst dot org. ",

The story is about a black teenage girl named Starr who is torn between two worlds - her rich, white private school and her poor, black neighborhood - who witnesses the shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a white police officer.  It's more than timely and is utterly, terribly relevant.  As such, this is a film that needed to be good, and it's all the more disappointing that it isn't. I wonder if all the positive critical reviews are based more on the importance of the content rather than the quality of the film - in an effort to support the subject of the film, they have overlooked its many flaws.  I think the news/opinion website The Root said it best with their article entitled \"The Hate U Give isn't a very good movie and it's very hard to say that out loud\".  The entire movie is preachy and shamefully emotionally manipulative.  The actual shooting scene is genuinely tense and emotional and smacks of realism, but everything that happens after that feels as cheeseball as an afterschool special.  It's not the fault of the actors, all the performances are solid (especially Amandla Stenberg in the lead role); it's the writing.  This movie was adapted from a YA novel, and you feel it every step of the way; the film reduces its charged subject matter into clumsy YA melodrama.  I laughed out loud several times... and this is not the kind of movie you want your audience to laugh at.  Beyond the melodrama, the movie compartmentalizes incredibly complicated issues, reducing them to basic \"black vs white\" and \"blacklivesmatter\" vs \"bluelivesmatter\" constructs.  If only it were that simple!  There is no nuance here, and the film's reliance on standard movie tropes and character stereotypes is catastrophic to the film's message.  The two environments that Starr has to switch between are extreme ends of opposite poles: her neighborhood is a dingy, drug- and crime-ridden wasteland while her school is a shiny and pristine paradise.  Similarly, the white kids at her school are vapid and empty-headed, completely oblivious of current social/racial issues (all while appropriating the hell out of black culture); the cops are racist bigots on power trips (even the black ones); Starr's family and friends from her neighborhood are the good-guy underdogs struggling to rise above their oppression.  People just don't fall into such neat, clearly defined categories. I appreciate that this is a rare film that is told from the perspective of black protagonists - we absolutely need more of these movies, but not ones that minimize the complexity of these issues and shoehorn all their characters into unrealistic dichotomies. Most things in life are not so literally black and white, and this movie didn't have to be, either.  My fear is that this film does more to divide the races than unite them.  This is an important story that needed to be told, but it deserved a better workup than this.",

The story was illogical at points. The climatic scene of the toddler holding the weapon was just ridiculous. The fake deepness of connecting everything to a Tupac quote. I'm not one who wants to scrub all poor representations of black characters from the media, because black people caught in tragic circumstances and systemic oppression do exist. And they deserve to have their stories told as well. But this was just some comical representation of what people think oppressed black people's lives are like.

The uneasy balance between these worlds is shattered when Starr witnesses the fatal shooting of her childhood best friend Khalil at the hands of a police officer. Now, facing pressures from all sides of the community, Starr must find her voice and stand up for what's right. THE HATE U GIVE is based on the critically acclaimed New York Times bestseller by Angie Thomas and stars Amandla Stenberg as Starr, with Russell Hornsby, Regina Hall, Common, Anthony Mackie and Issa Rae.\n\nThis is one of those films where the trailers made it look kinda bad, admittedly. It's a YA adaptation and we know the track record for those films. Unfortunately, they're not the hottest. While this film faces its problems, it's not doubt an extremely powerful film that allowed me to enter into a world that I don't completely understand and get to experience it. It was something that hit me emotionally and for that, I really commend this film. \n\nWhat's best about this film is the story and how much it means to society today. The story was well written, although kind of cheesy at times. I think the voice-over and some of the moments in this film weren't the best executed, but they were overcome by some of the otherwise brilliant moments throughout. \n\nThe acting in this film is really what sold me. The main cast was phenomenal and their characters were just as strong. There was a lot of emotional weight to each one and the characters were very developed.\n\nIn the end, \"The Hate U Give\" had my emotions running high. It's something that I think is valuable to watch, especially in today's world. This is one of the more memorable ones of 2018.",

The beginning wasâ¦good. Characters are introduced as you meet the Carter family for the first time. It definitely could have been better, however. I felt it dragged on for slightly too long, but at the same time I understand director George Tillman Jr.  was going for an emotional connection. While it couldâ(TM)ve been better, it is solid enough of a start to get you into the movie.\n\nCharacters: 10\nThe film revolves around Starr and her family. Each family member contributes to the overall dynamic of the story. You can see how Starr is shaped by her strong father Maverick (Russell Hornsby) who is all about standing up for whatâ(TM)s right and protecting the family at all costs. Her mother Lisa (Regina Hall) just wants Starr to have a better life than herself growing up. Starr recognizes that and tries to embrace it, but also feels guilty while doing so. It was therapeutic watching Starr evolve into a woman after feeling so powerless in the earlygoings of the film. All of these characters, even those outside of the Carter family, have depth and add value to the story.\n\nCinematography/Visuals: 10\n\nConflict: 10\n\nGenre: 8\n\nMemorability: 10\nThe Hate U Give is packed with twists and turns that you donâ(TM)t expect or see coming. It really is a small world that we live in, too small to go around hating each other. The film succeeds by showing us just how small this world is. There are a number of memorable scenes that remain etched in my brain long after watching the movie. Itâ(TM)s one of those films that stays with you, leaving you with cause for much thought.\n\nPace: 9\nThere were a few spots where the build-up was a bit slow, but itâ(TM)s not a major issue that impacts the movie as a whole. This goes back to what I was mentioning in the beginning. Not perfect, but Iâ(TM)m not sure how much I would have done differently than Tillman Jr. For the most part, the movie is highly entertaining and has a consistent flow.\n\nPlot: 10\n\nResolution: 10\nEnded just the way it should, not with some fairytale conclusion, but reality. Thank God for justice, but the movie leaves us with the full understanding that there is still work yet to be done. Very strong messaging.\n\nOverall: 95\nThe Hate U Give is not your typical race war movie as it pushes for peace in coexistence and challenges the ideas of self-identification. The dynamics involved here are truly interesting as you see a black vs. white vs. hood life going on and what happens when lines cross. With a solid cast and story, it is not a surprise that this is one of my favorite films of 2018.",

The centre of the story is Starr who, along with her siblings, has been raised to be strong and proud of their blackness. They live in a black ghetto area of a large American city. From a young age they are taught lessons on how to stay safe from not only their neighbourhood but the white powers that be, namely the police. To further their safety they are sent to a predominantly white school. So Starr and her brothers get to exist in two worlds. When Starr's best friend is shot and killed without cause by a policeman it sets off a powerful story of racial politics and deadly consequences. The mainly young cast is mostly excellent and it's an important film in these days of discrimination. But the main fault I found is that it is often heavy handed, some of the writing lacks nuance and is instructional rather than informative. Points are rammed home rather than happen naturally. Still it has a certain innate power and a passionate heart that makes for an enjoyable if flawed film.",

It does go over some powerful concept of black lives matter. With people wanting Starr to come out with the truth to reveal that they are living under fear when it comes to a police officer. That they are mistreated. The pressure is on Starr when she is threatened by a drug dealer known as King (Anthony Mackie) which Khalil use to work for him. He wants Starr to keep it quiet about what happened that night. While her supportive father Maverick (Russell Hornsby) is hoping she sticks up for her people. And her boyfriend Chris (K.J. Apa) is trying to be they're for her but she keeps putting him at a distant. It does have its emotional powerful story. With Starr feeling like she is divided with going to a high privilege school Williamson. While she hides the truth from her friends that she lives in a rough black neighborhood Garden Heights. With a growing rampage towards the officer that shot Khalil and the crowd trying to protest for justice. Starr feeling like the weight of the world is on her. After witnessing her friend die, being threatened by a drug dealer, and her friend's loyalties are tested with the officer shooting. Amandla Stenberg delivered a good performance as Starr. Regina Hall, Russell Hornsby, and Common delivered a good performance. Anthony Mackie was decent as King. K.J. Apa was good as Chris, and trying to connect with Starr when she is trying to be distant. One thing I did not like about the film is it was lacking the depth of Starr's past. She is still struggling emotionally about losing her childhood friend. And it was only briefly shown. Overall, The Hate U Give is a good film. It has a powerful story. The cast is good.

Haven't seen such  a moving movie in a long time. Great acting especially by the lead girl. Saw it twice and initially had the same chills I had when I watched Boyz n the Hood and Menace to Society many years ago because it was so real and raw.\n\nMy 14 yr old loved the book and movie equally, so good job since books are usually better than the film.\n\nDefinitely worth watching at least once - even if you can't relate...",

            "content": "In a world packed with opinions shaped by media; News, social media, YouTube, etc. it can be hard to find an opinion that you feel has the evidence to back it up. The movie The Hate You Give directed by George Tillman Jr. is filled with opinions and views, some different but many the same. While all of the opinions presented are valid, the main view from Starr's perspective is overpowering and has great evidence to back it up. While the views of her uncle, a black police officer along with a man at a protest trying to get the protesters to calm down, are very poorly supported. Unfortunately, this can lead people to look at law enforcement as the enemy, as Starr played by Amandla Stenberg has a hard time understanding their views. This makes the movie a bit unrealistic because the poorly supported opinions do have good evidence to back them up outside of the movie. However, if you are able to acknowledge both sides, there is a great message that can definitely change the world.\n\tThe movie starts off with Starr introducing her community that she very regularly sees. Later on, Starr and childhood friend Khalil played by Algee Smith drive home from a party that was too dangerous to be at. Driving home, Khalil is pulled over for not using a turning signal. When he steps out of the car, he reaches back in to get a brush and see if his friend is ok. Starr tells him to follow the cops instructions so that both of them are safe. The cop ends up shooting him in fear of him reaching in the car for a gun. This makes Starr fight for justice for her friend who was killed right in front of her. Throughout her journey for justice, she encounters racism, drugs, family issues, and high school. She also has two \"personalities\" one at school and one at home. During the movie, she transitions between having these different personalities to only one that she is very happy with and shows her true self.\nThis movie includes a really great story that many people can relate to today. This is what makes it so empowering, the problems the characters face are problems people watching the movie might have faced too. So if you go to watch this breathtaking movie, keep the message in mind, whether you agree or disagree, acknowledge it, and try to understand it. That also goes for the less acknowledged opinions that are represented in the movie like those of Starr's uncle and the man trying to get people to calm down at a protest.

I'll give the movie 5/5 stars because it tells a story and has a lot of meaning to it. You might be wondering who the main characters are the main characters are Starr, Sekinai, Mavrik, King, Seven, Chris, and Khalil. This story is about Starrs black friend who got shot by a white police officer. The rest of the is about how Starr fights back against racism and cruelty against the black community.  My opinion on this movie is it a very powerful movie with a sense of humor and a good theme. Also, it's a positive rating!.",

Well if you do this movie is great for you although there is a book about it I'm talking about the movie. The Hate U Give simply known as THUG is about a 16-year-old girl called Starr with two râ(TM)s she experience racial conflict and police brutality by officer 115. The officer 115 put 3 bullets in Khalil (Starr's first kiss and best friend). Khalil got shot 3 times for not giving a signal to get on the road. When Starr was younger she also experienced the same thing with her other best friend, her other best friend got shot by gang members. From here the movie was pretty depressing but Starr is trying her best to speak up for Khalil. She is having problems with friends and her boyfriend (who is white) after this because they don't know that she is the witness. This movie has some comedy and some drama mostly every teen need in a movie like if it were a reality show. This movie is mostly recommended to people who are mature about police brutality and racial conflict there are some jokes that might throw you off but so far the movie is terrific!",

Another main idea was that there are very little opportunities for good pay for the citizens of Garden Heights. Once the opportunities are gone, they need money and are forced to get it through unlawful ways such as selling drugs for the King Lords. They conveyed there message well, and the acting was very strong towards the end of the movie. That was my opinion of The Hate U Give.",

There is no doubt that it is tone perfect and evergreen in theme, but at the same time, for a good chunk of the film it doesn't quite leap at you.\n\nIt is strong and powerful, but it's a bit on the nose. The Hate U Give echos reality, and whether it's a work of fiction or not, it feels like a story that definitely exists for real in this world.\n\nWhich is where the film shines. There are many a scene that sucker punches you, and makes you realise that this is the way people are, and there's good and bad. There's one particular scene that wonderfully illustrates how those who say they care on the outside of the truth of it all don't really get it at all. The sympathisers that still don't quite realise that there's more to the problems with race and society than just a hashtag.\n\nThe Hate U Give captures you from the beginning, showing how from a young age, kids in the world of the movie - and that world in real life - have to know that this is how things are, and those things are shitty. It's fucked up that they have to truly follow instructions to the letter to stay alive in this world.\n\nThe themes are strong. They resonate, they open eyes, they don't back away from the fact that this is how it is. And we need change. \n\nAs an overall film, though, it doesn't light a fire as well as it could. Maybe it's the pacing, maybe it's the acting, there's just some missing link in The Hate U Give, which is disappointing. It pleasantly surprises coming off the trailer, but it does still feel like a young adult version of a really great film, and instead it's just a really good film.",

Amandla Stenberg gives an incredible lead performance, full of raw intensity and emotional gravitas. The films primary target is police brutality, but it also manages to tackle the tough family dynamic, the damage caused by a life of crime, gang violence and the thin line between peaceful protest and all-out anarchy, but never feels bloated or overloaded. The film keeps the focus on its lead and the trauma she goes through, keeping her secret not only from the general public, but also from her nearest and dearest. When it finally gets out, chaos is unleashed, and she quickly finds herself at the forefront of a mission for justice. The movie might be a little too simplistic in its depictions of race relations and discrimination at times, but that didn't stop it from containing some of the most emotional moments I see on screen this year. But far from being a sentimental slog, it contains plenty of levity too, revealing the characters through their love of life and desire to live it. Keep an eye on the cast and crew, and hopefully they'll bring us more films like this in the near future.",

I cried several times, so the emotion was still on target.  Life in the ghettto appeared to be marred by contradictions; people were both the perpetrators of as well as the victims of violence.  Having been involved with some BLM protests here in Atlanta, I wish they had included the sheer NUMBER of activists we used to get in the streets to reflect the movement's size, but I suppose they needed to keep things small enough to fit in a studio.

            "content": "I agree with the commenter, Wessede Barrett, 100%. This movie provided a very poor depiction of the issues black communities face in their relationship with the police force, and of white-black relations in general. There were too many unnecessary subplots that were introduced but never concluded. It seemed like the director/producer of the film wanted to tackle a number of really complex themes with this movie, but failed to elaborate on any one theme fully. While watching the movie, I felt that the scenarios the characters encountered were all very unrealistic and unlikely to ever happen. I am a black woman, and quite honestly, while watching the film, I completely understood why her friend was shot by the officer. I think he was demonstrating extremely erratic behavior the entire time he was dealing with the officer. And grabbing for anything out of your car window (especially at night when it's hard to see clearly) after being asked to not move, would incite an unsettling feeling in any officer. I mean, really, who decides to take this moment during a traffic stop to tend to personal grooming?? Really?? It honestly made me feel like his shooting was a little justified. \n\nAnd Starr focusing in the interview on the fact that her friend was affiliated with the largest drug organization in town made me feel like she was personally responsible for the officer walking free of charges. His drug dealing had absolutely nothing to do why he was shot. But it then gave the jury complete justification for her friend's murder. And it also led to another unnecessary subplot of her family now at war with the big-time drug lords. She never needed to mention the King Lords, and that whole feud between her and the drug lords would have been completely avoided. Why blur out your face, instead of just not mentioning the King Lords? They had absolutely nothing to do with her friend's shooting, and that helped in no way in indicting the officer.\n\nThen the film tried to depict her white friend as a racist. When in all actuality, based off of Starr's interview where she completely painted her friend out as one of the most powerful drug lords in town, her friend was pretty justified in thinking that the cop was \"just doing his job\". I actually felt bad for her white friend. Yea, she liked trying to \"act black\" in order to fit in, but her not understanding the injustice in shooting a person who she was led to believe was a known dangerous drug dealer was entirely as a result of Starr's horrible interview. \n\nThis movie just felt like it was a film made by a highschool multimedia student. It was all over the place. It was unrealistic. It just made no sense. I still don't understand who gave who hate. The title and running theme of the movie is The Hate U Give (Little Infants F***s Everyone - T.H.U.G.L.I.F.E). But I don't understand who the film thought was responsible for giving the hate, and to which little infants they gave it out, or how it F***ed everyone. The message was essentially nonexistent, or just inconsistent. It seemed to condone the shooting, yet at the same time not. Claim things were racist that weren't.\n\nIt was just really frustrating because lower income communities of color could really benefit from a powerful film that truly depicts the internal conflicts and complexities that do face us in our everyday lives and when it comes to dealing with racist police. But this film was far from that. This film was a disaster. And I honestly feel that it did more harm than good... dressing a very justifiable shooting as a racist one. Now any white people (or anyone for that matter) that watch this film and who may be unfamiliar with actual racist shootings that are NOT justifiable in any way (which happen way too often) will feel like the victim must have been acting sporadically like the boy in the movie. Making it that much more difficult for us to bridge the gap of misunderstanding amongst different races. So disappointed.",

            "content": "A conversation starter.  This is the story about a young African-American high schooler named Starr (Amandla Stenberg).  She attends a predominately white high school, but lives in an impoverished black neighborhood.  When her black friend is gunned down by a police officer during a traffic stop while she is mere feet away in the passenger seat, her life is irrevocably changed.  Now this is based on an acclaimed novel that I had only heard about.  I knew about the subject matter, and it is absolutely in an important one, so I wanted to do my part to support this while it was still in theaters.  Well, I am going to support it even a step further, because this material is so strong, I went ahead and downloaded the audio book onto my phone so I can delve even deeper into this story.  Now I know that this hasn't performing all that well at the box office, just barely making its budget back, but it isn't too difficult to see why.  When you hear about what this is about, you automatically think you're going to be walking into a feel bad movie, which is just about the last thing that people looking for escapism want to see.  Well, I prefer it when the movies that I watch actually have a message, and this is some pretty timely social commentary.  The Hate U Give is topical, and it is saying all of the things that usually are left unsaid; we see so much racism every day in this country, but it is rare that somebody actually calls it out like it is.  Why do black parents need to explain to their preteen children how to interact with a police officer if they get pulled over?  It isn't that this is a normal talk that they want to have with their children.  It is the society that we live in, and yeah, it is more than messed up.  Change has been long overdue, and I feel that movies and books that bring attention to a wide of group as possible are performing an invaluable service.  As far as the movie itself goes, you should see it.  I don't think it is perfect, and while this will likely make the cut for my Best of the Year list, it will likely rank around the middle to bottom. I feel like the direction is a little flat; that is not to say that it has any glaring problems, I just feel like there isn't a lot of flair that bumps it up to that next level.  Still, the material itself is the star, and it shines a spotlight brightly at a conversation that demands to be had.  If you aren't going to listen, who will?",

The questions raised in here are rhetoric and doesn't make you think twice. Yes, it is ethically unstable and has morale conflicts for you to ponder about, but again that too are filled in on the usual shoes. And addition to that, what's intriguing is how fair it is. The perspective is three dimensional, the limelight spots on both the stage and the audience.\n\nIt has captured the apt depiction of the current generation's lifestyle. The references, the vocab, the music, the slangs and the abbreviations, the research done by the makers is undoubtedly plausible. Even the preachings among the subsequent generations passing their legacies have updated their way of conveying the message. The stories that a father tells his children to get their attention, the route itself has changed and these are the real gems of the feature.\n\nThis is the place where the writers are completely honest with you and they have given themselves this space at each aspects to keep the audience tangled and the story more grounded and practical. The performance is another strong aspect of the tale. Not only does it demand it, but is delivered aplenty in here especially by the protagonist Stenberg who is the trump card of this tale that carries it off all on her shoulder. She is surprisingly good on melting down and sparkling up, but the silent pitches that are essential is where she sweeps away the charm. Supporting her thoroughly lies a great cast like Hall, Hornsby and Mackie whose underdog character often steals the show.\n\nIt is a sensitive subject to explore upon and the narration is very well aware of that. The structure of the script and the editing of the feature allows you to walk the balanced line. The aftermath or the repercussions that such an incident cause is calculated in detail and the magnitude of it communicates fluently with the audience because of the brilliant execution by Tillman Jr. Each emotion creates a long lasting impact because it has an essence of grit and intolerability that elevates as the clock ticks. Despite of having such a taboo subject the makers never manipulates the viewers to draw out the emotions, the storyline is kept prior to any other thing.\n\nBy the last act arrives, you are put on a stand by the makers to judge upon it and stand on a definite answer and this is the kind of storytelling we need more; unbiased and non-provocative. The argumentative conversations, both sides of the points kept on the table, narrative monologues, jaggedly projected humane nature and stellar performances, is what fuels this tale for two hours. The Hate U Give is the infomercial that the makers gives us, and fortunately this endorsement isn't sponsored by anyone; it has a stamp credible like the law itself.",

The film opens up with a black father named Maverick explaining to his 2 young children what they should do in a situation if they are ever stopped by a cop. This opening alone is fantastic and gives the audience a unique perspective for someone to understand the fear and the dynamic of what it means to be a person of color and have fear for your life over something as minimal as being pulled over by a police officer. The film itself is extremely well directed and written, Amandla Stendberg gives a wonderful performance as Starr Carter, her charming presence and innocence to a harsh and cruel reality is phenomenal and completely Oscar Worthy. The film touches on an extremely delicate social issue regarding unarmed black people being shot and killed by police officers. Star is given a ride home from her childhood friend Khalil but he is pulled over by a police officer, the officer initially seems patient and quiet but Khalil tests his patience by questioning his reasoning for stopping him. Starr has been prepared for this situation her entire life so she knows the danger Khalil can put them both in but Khalil continues to dismiss her fears. The officer asks Khalil to step out of the car and keep his hands where he can see them as the officer goes back to the car to run his information. Khalil then reaches into the car for his hairbrush not taking the situation seriously but is quickly shot when the officer mistakes the brush for a gun much to Starr's horror. Many questions come into play here for many viewers, Why doesn't Khalil just cooperate? Why didn't he listen to Starr? Why didn't he keep his hands in view of the officer? Why didn't the officer give Khalil a warning when he saw thought he had a weapon? Would the officer have reacted this way with someone who was white? All these questions are never given a clear answer, does that mean the police officer was racist? Not necessarily, he was doing his job and told Khalil to keep his hands where he can keep them, and this is happening during the night so maybe he couldn't see the brush clearly. Did Khalil deserve to die because he didn't listen though? Absolutely not, he's a kid who got stopped for something minimal like failing to signal, how was he supposed to know something like this was going to happen? The film could easily come across as biased to many but the film does give us a police officer's perspective and the fear one may have when performing their duty. In a world where many are split based on politics, race, sexuality, etc. It's nice to see a film that offers a unique perspective on an issue many are horrified by that we as a society have grown accustomed to seeing more often as time goes by.",

Starr has dual personas, the girl from the hood who will fight for what is right and who had the 'talk' when she was young about the inevitable 'law' confrontations to come. Then there's the Starr who goes to private school, paid for by her hood based parents who want the best for her. Here, Starr is non reactionary and very placid. But one night her 2 lives start to collide when her childhood friend is shot by a twitchy police officer. This brings out the hood girl in Starr and she breaks her cover to fight for what is right and appears on TV. This angers the local gangster. You need to watch to find out why. \n\nThe Hate U Give takes a personalised, minimal violence, storytelling route through aspiration, tragedy, and revelation as one line dominates the movie. It apparently comes from TuPac - T.H.U.G.L.I.F.E: The Hate U Give Little Infants F^@£s Everything. A message delivered succinctly when a small child holds a gun and is ready to fire it. \nA wonderful film that shows the pain of hood life without resorting to excessive violence, instead showing a story of human emotion.",

Amandla Stenburg is still a lousy, dull, and painfully uncharismatic actress, she is just the icing on the shit cake. These type of movies have been done to death! Movies about racism towards black people from white people have passed their time and are super old, cliched, cheap, sappy, and tiring! \nOf course many people are going to be sad over that! Movies about racism are annoyingly old and dull already! Can't Hollywood be more original and a lot less political for once? The white cop who shot the black man was actually justified if you have common sense. The cop strictly told him not to enter in the car cause he was still investigating a hit-and-run or investigating the car for illegal drugs something like that, but the idiot black man just ignores him and reaches his hand in the car door despite being cautiously told not to touch the car and/or get inside, so the white cop shoots the stupid black man for disobeying after he specifically warned by him not to do it. \n So now after that scene, the movie whole movie becomes a trainwreck and a big bore fest. The rest of the stupid movie tries to make the police officer seem guilty despite him not doing anything wrong and only acting on basic protocol. The family of the black man who was shot by the white policeman all grieve over him and then they try testifying against the white cop and making him feel guilty despite the fact that it wasn't really his fault. This movie is nothing but overrated, pretentious anti-white SJW propaganda garbage! The Hate U Give is not emotional, it's just pretentious bullshit!\n\nRating: 2/10",

There were so many elements that were left out that made me feel like this was almost a different story from the one in the novel. If I watched the movie by itself I would like it, but when I compare it to the deep dive that is the novel it just feels surface and shallow. I waited for half of the movie to meet DeVante and he never showed up!!! He was a huge part of the book! I thought the character Chris was cast poorly, but that could just be because he didn't fit the picture in my head. The ending is COMPLETELY different and what the heck happened with Iesha? They just didn't give us the details that made the story so great. I hope this helps my students see that movies and books are usually worlds apart and very few are able to move from the screen to the page without losing some of what made them such beautiful stories to begin with. I am glad it is getting good reviews and that people are watching it because it is important, it just strayed too far from the book for me.",

However, despite a strong narrative and solid performances, the filmmaking is sometimes a little too afterschool special-esque for my liking, there's a few eye-roll worthy lines thrown in and some pretty heavy-handed rhetoric to counter some of the attempts at objectivity. Most of the scenes are shot competently but not interestingly, often the movie feels like it lacks dimension, actual physical space since so many shots come straight on. There's a lot of voiceover in typical YA fashion that could've been transformed into something more appealing for a visual medium as well, Amandla Stenberg manages to overcome this largely with a standout performance, but she shouldn't have had to. Overall, it's still a worthwhile and dare I say important film. Just wish there was more style to go with the substance.",

Without a doubt, this is one of the most powerful movies I've ever seen and it will leave you thinking. There is so much more I want to say about this movie but I'll just let y'all watch it for yourselves.",

Sadly, because of who she is, she probably won't get any Oscar recognition for her performance.\n\nStenberg plays Starr Carter, a Black girl who in the evenings and weekends spends time in the ghetto living with her parents, brother and half-brother while during the week goes to a private, white, elite school where she feels she is 'Starr 2\" to avoid being stereotyped.\n\nOne night she is at a party and a friend, a boy, Khalil, played by Algee Smith, she has known since childhood offers to drive her home. Within 10 minutes Khalil, a black boy, who fails to signal when switching lanes is pulled over by a white policeman and when he reaches for a hairbrush is shot. Starr, handcuffed, watches her friend bleed out and die.\n\nMany people have heard about 'the talk' black parents have to have with their children, they have seen television newscasts and read accounts of many black kids being shot by while police with the former dying and the latter not paying any price for what they have done.\n\nThis is a film that shows what the talk is about, what black kids and families go through and have to face. It takes us behind the newscasts we see and hear. Audrey Wells wrote the screenplay based on the book by Angie Thomas takes us into the mind of a young black girl, Starr, and allows us to see exactly how she is affected by not only those around her but by life.\n\nWe meet her father Maverick (Russell Hornsby) an ex-convict, who has opened his own store and early in the film gives the 'talk, to his 3 kids explaining what to do not if but when they are stopped by the police. His wife Lisa (Regina Hall) loves her husband and sees him through the bad times in his life and is now they embarrass their children by expressing their love to each other.\n\nMaverick's brother, Carlos (Common) is a policeman and in talks with his niece Starr explains what a policeman goes through when he stops a black person as well as a white person.  We live what Starr goes through when threatened by a drug dealer named King (Anthony Mackie) because her telling the grand jury convened regarding whether to charge the policeman who killed her friend can get him into trouble and when an activist and lawyer, played by Issa Rae, guides her through that grand jury happenings and Starr's conflict about whether to tell the truth or keep silent.\n\nThis and much more, such as Starr having a white boyfriend, gets us inside her head about all that she is involved in and around her. Amanda Stenberg's Starr lets us into the mind of a black teenager while the screenplay and the director, George Tillman, Jr., takes us behind the headlines, the lead stories and shows us what really happens.\n\n\"The Hate U Give\" is a must-see for many reasons including a performance by Amanda Stenberg that will be for her to beat and a movie that shows us that think we know it all know very little about other people.",

This is a GREAT movie and a learning moment that could truly change your perspective on those you see as strangers. TO ALL: GO ENJOY A POWERFUL STORY!",

Sorry for toying with your emotions. But, I am in a mix of emotions coming out of this movie. My eyes may be a bit swollen so obviously no video review. I went through a mix of emotions with the main character. Most of the movie is through her eyes. A teen growing up in the hood going to a private school. Learning how to be two different people for both of her worlds. Not sure who she can show her true self to. Not sure, which is her true self. Coming of age is hard, but coming of age with this character - let us just say you reach all new levels of vulnerability. The acting by this young actress is truly amazing. The directing and writing... all I can say is bravo. If you watch this movie and you don't get it, maybe you just need to pay attention. Reach out and try to understand. Not saying everything is so black and white, brown or blue... But the hate you show around you, reaches our youth. Learn to be better, learn to show our youth better.

That whittles down her Harry Potter threesome to one (another had been killed by gang violence years before). So a 17 year old girl has more cause to feel PTSD than most war veterans. Starr's dad is a former associate of the local head gangster, played by the terribly menacing Anthony Mackie. Starr's success at life so far is a tribute to her grit and intellect.\nI'll mention two extraordinary things about this film. One was a show-stopping scene as Starr questions her uncle, who's a cop, played by Common. She wants to understand the double-standard applied by police, when pulling over people of color, versus a hypothetical white guy in a Mercedes. She doesn't get the answer from him that she expects - he's internalized the fear of black men that white cops have. Her fury is stoked in that moment. \nSecondly, I was impressed all over again, despite what I already knew on the subject, about the universality of a series of books and movies about the private school education of British wizards and witches.",

            "content": "\"The Hate U Give\" is one of 2018's most memorable, intense, and thought-provoking films. From the moment this film began, I was invested in the story and the characters. The film is very well acted and Amandla Stenberg does an outstanding job in the lead role. The story explores countless themes about modern-day racism, social issues, activism, and more. Usually, films that focus on young people can come off as cheesy or over the top but this one tended to be more on the realistic side. The story isn't designed to be easy to watch, but it is important for everyone to experience it. It is exceptionally relevant to many problems today. I was emotionally invested and felt on the edge of my seat for a majority of this movie because it constantly felt like anything could happen next. If I were to nitpick, I would say the film might be just a little bit too long, but honestly, it's not enough for me to lower my rating of the film. Overall, this film is an unforgettable one that will stay with me for a very long time and I think it might be one of the most masterfully handled films of the young adult genre.",
