It felt quite authentic, although I suppose I wouldn't necessarily know how such people live their lives. I found it endearing how the younger members helped each other out. \n\nThere is some funny dialogue - in an amusing way, rather than especially laugh out loud. I found myself feeling quite sorry for some people, due to their circumstances. It is surprisingly thoughtful, I suppose. Overall I thought this was a very warm and charming film, which I'd recommend, especially to fans of Japanese films. I really liked the under stated nature it has. Ultimately, its a film about family love. I'd also say its quite a symbolic film.\n\nI should note that there are sexual scenes present, so its not suitable for everyone - its rated 15 in the UK, for reference.",

            "content": "What if Fagin and the Artful Dodger set up a lighthearted criminal gang in early 21st century Japan and also there was a lot of gut-punching family drama?\n\nThere's quite a lot to unpack in Shoplifters; it's a drama about imperfect and often self-serving characters who find themselves pulled back and forth between self-interest and a love for others, about living lives that are valid and real despite hardship and complicated circumstances, and about the strength of interpersonal connections that go beyond simple blood relations.  Hirokazu Kore-eda does an excellent job of making the audience feel at home in the cramped family quarters, sharing in the camaraderie and misfortune in equal measure, stripping away concerns about morality in favor of practicality, and leaving his ensemble cast to discover where the emotional chips will fall in such circumstances. Realistic, poignant, and featuring both solid performances and a very good soundtrack, Shoplifters feels a bit like Oliver Twist meets Ozu.\n\nAmong recent Palme d'Or winners, this drama with its wealth of emotional complexity certainly feels among the more deserving.

Also like Parasite, it shows what this family must resort to in order to survive. And while there is a little bit of scheming — mainly concerning grandma's (Kirin Kiki) pension checks and a strange relationship she has with her late husband's son from an affair — the Shibata family operates a much more working-class and petty crime hustle. As the title says, shoplifting is the main source of material goods, which Shota (Kairi Jō) and Osamu (Lily Franky) carry out with a signal system — Osamu also works in construction until he is injured on the job (and doesn't receive unemployment). Nobuyo (Sakura Ando) works in an industrial laundry service and Aki (Mayu Matsuoka) works in a \"hostess club\" — think prostitution-lite. Early on, this multi-generational family adopts (not legally, of course, it's basically kidnapping) Juri (Miyu Sasaki), a little girl whose parents criminally neglect her. What makes Shoplifters so enjoyable is the dynamic of the members, the little victories they score, their bond, and, precisely peeled back, layer by layer, that everything on the surface isn't quite what it seems. Grandma is a gem and it kinda sucks what ultimately happens to her, although, I couldn't help but think it's exactly what she would've done in their situation. The scene of Shota falling from the bridge and the orange spillage thereafter was just beautiful filmmaking. The film also offers probably the most tender moment in sex work I've ever seen on-screen. The conclusions for each character were logical and touching, however, Juri's ending will not make you feel good.",

They both work menial jobs but supplement their income by shoplifting, mainly with their 'son' Shota. There is also a sister in the family and soon a very young girl who they take in from an abusive family. The shoplifting in question only serves a small part of the film. The film gently meanders along with lovely scenes inside their modest home and trips to the beach. There is not much plot but a whole lot of great character development. It expertly studies the meaning of family. That is, it's not always biological but rather a family can exist via need and circumstance.

It is difficult to say something that does not work in the film, showing that family is much more than blood connections and with strong social criticism.

With his latest feature, Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Koreeda has crafted a mesmerizing movie about poverty in Japan. It's the filmmaker's first attempt to humanize the lives of a shoplifting family, but he pulls it off seamlessly. Using captivating cinematography, Koreeda draws viewers into the world of a close-knit family of scammers. From intimate close-ups to stunning establishing shots, the cinematography keeps viewers immersed in the movie. In terms of acting, the entire ensemble is at the top of its game. Lily Franky delivers a fantastic performance as a guilty father that encourages his kids to steal for a living. With riveting expressions, Franky captures the fear, desperation and humanism of a father that makes tough choices to survive. The supporting cast, which includes standout child actors, is also worthy of recognition. Although \"Shoplifters\" is an undeniably unforgettable family drama, ultimately it is not a flawless film. If there's a minor drawback to the movie, it suffers from a slow pace. Due to its slow pacing, it is one of those films that may not appeal towards mainstream audiences. Nevertheless, fans of Hirokazu Koreeda's previous films will definitely enjoy \"Shoplifters\" and so will movie-goers interested in Japanese Cinema. At a time when foreign films are rarely recognized in Hollywood, it's a momentous reminder that stories from Japan deserve to be seen and heard.",

Early on they reluctantly take in a young neighbor being abused by her mother and her mother's boyfriend. She's called \"Yuri,\" which may or may not be her name. Indeed, none of the family members may be who they seem. There's a temptation to whisper to one's movie-going partner, \"Now is she the mother? Is he her son?\" \nIt turns out this confusion is at the heart of acclaimed Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda's Palme d'Or-winning portrait of Tokyo's underclass, eking out a communal living in the wealthy metropolis.\n\nThe \"family's\" means of making money are all suspect or tenuous. The grandmother taps the welfare state by pretending she's the only one living in the subsidized home now housing six people, and she takes money off her husband's son by a second marriage by playing the grieving widow whose husband was stolen by another woman. The mother loses her low-level job as an ironer in a factory because of the family's vulnerability. The younger woman works – seemingly without guilt – in a peep-show. The father (an intense and affecting Lily Franky) shoplifts. He's also taught Shota, the adolescent, how to shoplift. \"What else do I have to teach him?\" he says. And Shota tells his new friend Yuri (Miyu Sasaki) that only children who aren't taught at home go to school. Despite their perilous state, the group has its pleasures, including crowding onto their tiny back porch to listen to fireworks they can't see, a metaphor for their off-the-grid life.\n\n\nThe fabric that holds the group together starts unravelling when Shota (portrayed with emotional nuance by Jyo Kairi) is shamed by a shop owner as he begins to teach Yuri the trade. The fraying, and in the process, the revealing, of the family relationships occurs swiftly and shockingly, leaving the audience to ponder the meaning of this extraordinary family and its relationship to blood, poverty, petty crime, guilt, money and love.\n\nDon't miss this film.",

They steal to survive and they crew of three ladies and a man with a son is about to grow. They take a cute little girl. She is not treated right in her original family so they feel that's an OK act. She seem to like her new world. The gang is never bad or horrible. They are quite nice, if you can cope the stealing.\n\nThis is a film that show you social realism - as always with Koreeda. It especially reminds me of the great \"Nobody Knows\". Empathy and care are all over here. Thought provoking and a beautiful film at the same time. \"What makes a family?\" was the question Koreeda asked himself before making this film and you truly can tell he wants to put some thoughts in your head around that exact matter. It's rather slow but it's many lovely scenes here. The story is developing perfectly and the two hours seem like a perfect lenght. The acting is very good and the total production is fine.\n\nPalme d'Or winner, Oscar nominated and for many known as the directors best film.

It should be a crime that people make spoiler trailers. I mean I came in knowing that they would be in jail and that the mother couldn't give birth! Pretty much half of the ending already, which means I definitely didn't enjoy this movie as much as I would have if I was forced into it not knowing a thing. Still though, I must say I definitely found this movie an enriching experience. The first 90 minutes are slow, but for me it was a meditation of sorts, just like with Roma. It opens up bit by bit about the circumstances that this family faces and their secrets, which come on full blast in the final 30 minutes. And I think its themes are some of the most thought-provoking and well-executed all year. You feel so much for this family and see the genuine warmth behind them, even under the dark criminals society and the media portrays them as. They steal things and ultimately even try to leave the boy, but you can tell just how much they regret their decision and are humanly connected. So ultimately, what is ethically or morally correct? Can we ever say that their actions are justified? Are laws really in place to do what is \"best\" for society? What exactly defines a parent and the love they give? These are themes I've been constantly pondering on after watching this film, and that is testament to what Kore-eda's marvelous direction has done. I must also praise the cast. This is one of the best ensembles I've seen. No one really stands out, because they're all in it together, and that's exactly what makes the familial connection they portray so believable and impactful. Credits as well to the two children, who were perfect casting choices. Adding on I also want to praise the magnificent score, a part of so many beautiful scenes like the beach scene and the ending, not to mention many other amazing scenes like the bonfire scene and the final scene with Yuri. \n\nSo I've been raving about this movie, but why does it only get 3 stars? Firstly, thank the spoilers. Pretty sure it would've at least been a 4/5 had I not had a hint of what was to come. And secondly, I didn't quite buy the boy trying to protect the girl from getting caught. I didn't take the danger was that great. That kinda ruined it for me, but overall still a deeply affecting and fully masterful film.",

He said that when a film is in competition for a prize, there must be consensus among the jury for it to win, so usually the most \"middle of the road\" entries win. While I have a less glamorous idea of what constitutes a middle of the road film, by Cannes Film Festival quality a more apt descriptor would be \"d'Or-bait\" for this year's winner, Hirokazu Kore-eda's Shoplifters. That's not really meant as a dig at the movie, it's just that I can see why it won and why I wasn't blown away by it.\n\nAmong this year's Academy Award nominees for best foreign picture, Shoplifters has plenty to compete with as well. By most accounts, Roma is a masterpiece of humanism and realism while Cold War is a smoky cool Eastern bloc romance, but outside of cinephile circles I hear a lot grumbling about how they're all boring, overlong, or unengaging. It comes as no surprise that many who appreciate the more energetic side of the movie spectrum have reacted this way, but what was a bit bothersome to me was how underwhelming Shoplifters ultimately proved to be.\n\nOf course it impressed the Frenchies as the film is totally cine-literate. There's a fairly overt reference to the opening scene of Godard's Contempt, and what poverty-stricken family drama doesn't by definition owe a great debt to The 400 Blows? There's plenty of diffused kinetic action and deliberately avoided spectacle to boot. But aside from some smiles, a little laughter, and one particularly touching scene, I couldn't help but feel a little...well...robbed. Here I was expecting a game-changer, and all I got was a well made film. As always, I should have governed my hype better.\n\nThe film concerns a makeshift family living in a hovel somewhere in Tokyo. They are grifters, shoplifters, and of ill-repute and they all love each other very much. Each has escaped or been stolen from their real families, in a sense \"shoplifted\" themselves from abuse, neglect, loveless relationships, and all the negativity that can come with the responsibility and obligations of a dysfunctional family. Much of the run time is dedicated to developing the characters and understanding who they are through their actions as opposed to overtly stating traits and backstory. In this sense it is fully realized and welcomes you in to their lives as they try to get by on their schemes and street smarts. Its substance far outweighs its style, and there's no score whatsoever, which makes for a perplexing watch in my book. Unfortunately, there's just not a lot to be visually enamored with past the performances and script. I can't say I was totally sold on it, but I can respect how it accomplishes its intent.

            "content": "What a movie. Recently I've warmed up to foreign films. I never can tell if they're actually good actors since I'm reading most of the time, but when I get a great story that's the winners for me. Shoplifters takes place in Japan and follows a group of criminals that steal in order to survive. We have a man named Osamu (Lily Frankly) a day laborer who is sort of the father figure for the younger people, Nobuyo (Sakura Ando) who is Osamu's wife and also works, Aki (Mayu Matsuoka) a younger lady that has dropped out of college and has a bit of a troubled life to herself, Shota (Jyo Kairi) a young boy that Osamu found alone in a car and has somewhat become his adopted son and then there's Hatsue (Kirin Kiki) a much older lady that is getting pension from her deceased husband and has the whole crew living with them. None of them in a way are technically related, but they have a system where they get through life and for the most part are doing ok. One night Osamu and Shota find a young girl named Yuri (Miyu Sasaki) locked outside of her home. They bring her over for dinner, but when they attempt to return her to her home they find out she's being abused, so the family adopts her as on of their own. They're poor, but the strength of the \"family\" is that they really truly love one another and through their hardships it's a theme that's shown throughout the movie. You don't get to usually choose your family, but this film shows that when you can it can literally be the most beautiful thing in the world. I thoroughly enjoyed this one and I enjoyed the performances and loved the pacing of it all. It's full of a lot of heart and there's a lot of really touching moments here. I can't recommend this one enough. Definitely, give it a look!",

It looks and sounds like real life, with real people doing real things in the real world. The screenplay might be rambling and vague at times, and there's a good 20 minutes you could cut out of the runtime, but it's a tale told with earnesty and dignity. It doesn't try and lampshade what the family are doing, and acknowledges that stealing is wrong, but allows us to understand for ourselves why they do it. It's driven purely by economic circumstance. It's the same with them taking in the little girl. It's wrong for them to do it, but they carefully consider the circumstances and determine the act, to their best judgement, to be the right thing to do. Some of the choices they make, especially towards the end, are at best baffling and at worst downright awful, but we also know that they're struggling every day to keep their heads above the water, and if they need to do something to survive, they'll do it. It's well acted, tightly directed and mostly unpredictable, except one-character death that is so blatantly signposted that you'd have to be asleep to miss it. It's not especially rewatchable, but its more than deserving of its praise, accolades and international recognition.",

And the result is one long satisfying stay. You feel like a guest entering his world and he welcomes you with open arms. He is a host that respects the boundaries and sculpts the antics accordingly. To be honest, his film is split into only two acts. It all starts with Yuri (Muyi Sasaki) accepting the house as a guest and the response she gets from each member of the house. Picking out a string of an equation of each member of the family with her, the act spirals out series of sequences that brick by brick constructs a suave strong bonding in the risky yet overprotective house.\n\nAnd on the other side, the second act, is completely opposite, it deconstructs those already established rumors, with the help of the clues spread around in its first act, and the fire catches slowly and poetically. The characters start questioning things that we- the audience- have been questioning from the first frame, and this connection has its own merits, it feels incredibly cathartic to dance in sync with the characters. Aki played by Mayu Matsuoka has the strongest role to portray, particularly since she is away from all the razzle dazzle that this family goes through.\n\nAnd yet spiritually she finds the same mirror to confront herself in. Her bonding with her grandmother that isn't actually explored thoroughly in the film is actually subjected to Sasaki's character that is in her initial stages of this grand welcome of the family; a masterstroke by the writer. Osamu (Lily Franky) and Shota (Jyo Kairi), the core relationship of the film pins down the fragility of the responsibility that a teacher or an idol carries but personally I loved his equation with Aki (Sakura Ando) as it never fully conjures the screen.\n\nThere is a lot that they have been through and evidently a lot we have to catch up with, the decision maker and the hard worker and the nature versus nurture, these improvements raised in early stages makes it more shady and juicy. And Ando as a protective guardian to this family has performed majestically, her confessional scenes- and there are plenty- can reason out of the room, the moment when she finally accepts Sasaki as her daughter and burns her clothes, is one of the best scene of the film.\n\nIt projects not only her willful right and the command over the spirit but also her confident to be a parent; a powerful scene sincerely fabricated by equally powerful performance. Koreeda's world is actually too diplomatic to be cinematic, yet his meticulous script that glorifies tiny characteristics of the scenario, brings out an exhilarating experience from us. This is a sort of script that thrives upon various elements, collecting them like coins, Koreeda is on a sprint for a marathon where at the end of the line, these Shoplifters are more humans even though less civilized.",

            "content": "We know very well that poor families suffer winter more than any other, yearning, whilst their bones splinter, the warm breeze of a summer morning. We know, as well, that when the sun and humidity arrive, these same families perspire and suffocate, seeking shade and shelter among deteriorated housing units that, paradoxically, end up amplifying the feeling of asphyxia. It is, of course, the triumph of the will of the paupers, who offer in exchange for a truce, without hesitating, the gradual mutilation of all sensual refinement that demands indistinctly a certain temperance; we are talking about the most quotidian representation of the conquest of physical resistance, facing the warning of all contraindications. If is decided to present such a story on the big screen, there is no denying that it'd be considered a universal one. However, the fact that it is located between those coordinates does not ensure, by default, that it will come to fruition succesfully. Addressing a colossal challenge like this, demands a distinguished sensitivity in the narrative disposition of its script and, necessarily, an impeccable direction; that is, the satisfactory achievement of an intricate project that demonstrates full mastery in the use and handling of specific audiovisual poetics. But how far can this poetics go? Possibly, as far as what was achieved by Hirokazu Kore-eda in his latest film. Shoplifters (2018), or Manbiki Kazoku (? ? ? ??), which translates directly to Shoplifting Family, is a jewel of hylemorphic cohesion, a risky gamble, which adds to the endless debate on the human question. It is about the film technique at the service of an impossible story, as impossible as life and the contradictions that abound in the heart of our modern societies.\nWith the new motion picture of Kore-eda, we are witnessing a story of extreme delicacy, which makes us forget at times, through characters so fascinatingly portrayed, either by their singular histrionic charm or by the unstoppable dynamics of the acting ensemble, that the best intentions are always measured by their consequences and collateral damages. What is trully problematic comes from the careful consideration of the principles of its characters, particularly those presented by the ones who are adults (Lily Franky, Andô Sakura, Kiki Kirin), because, even though condemned socially, they raise a lot of questions about our own conception of what exactly does a family is and mean. This is, possibly, the most lethal weapon that Kore-eda has to tear the hearts of his audience. We will return later on this point.\nTo sum up, the winner of the Palme d'Or 2018, tells the story of a family of low-level crooks. Initially, that of a couple of thieves: firstly, a middle-aged man, Osamu Shibata (brilliantly played by Lily Franky), who has developed a fugacious shoplifting technique with his son Shota (Jyo Kairi), as exquisitely demonstrates the inaugural scene, and the second, his partner, Nobuyo Shibata (Andô Sakura), who steals valuables from the garments that the clients of the hotel, where she's employed, send to the laundry. This couple lives with Nobuyo's sister, Aki (Matsuoka Mayu), who contributes to the family cause by working -with the sweat of her body- in a tempered-futuristic-japanese-style sex-service establishment (MVM, murderer of virgin men). They coexist at the home of Grandma Hatsue (Kiki Kirin), mother of both women. The old lady, with full awareness of the conduct of her family, takes care and supports the household through the government checks received due the pension of her late husband. Albeit affective and patient, from the beginning we are allowed to see that the old woman reserves something that others do not know (parapraxis as self-disclosure). Through a certain simulation of a smile and a melancholic stare, it is connected, in Hatsue's expression, the imminence of the family's collapse during the beginning, with its effective downfall in the epilogue. In this context, comes the appearance of Yuri (Sasaki Miyu), who is rescued by Shota, his new brother, and his father, Osamu. They find her abandoned and hungry in the street, outside her home, while her parents, inside, melt into the vilest, but credible, outbursts of domestic violence (which, as the film later reveals, even reached the little girl causing her considerable injuries). It is a clear example, perhaps already cliché, of the poor who reaches out to help the poorest, of the hungry who sacrifice the only morsel to give it to another believed to be in more need. The girl, although at the beginning with some resistance, is welcome in her new home. After the somewhat distrustful looks of her new mother, Nobuyo, and Shota's jealousy, she is organically assimilated by a family logic that even tries to initiate her on their criminal ventures. On this base, the story is triggered.\n\nWhat comes in the middle is a recrudescence of the harsh and ambivalent sensations that are thrown towards the spectator facing the events unfold. The characters go from mere cartoons to the nervousness that always accompanies the process of cracking an imposter. And we watch, then, how the narrative oscillates with violence between polarized extremes, namely, from the kidnapping of a girl to her warm acceptance within the household of the abductors, which is capable of making her feel, for the first time, determined, respected and loved; from frigidity to indulgence, from anonymity to intimate consideration of a stranger, from the dream of living in a new house with your family to the humbled recognition that your child can be lost joking about an expensive hammer... from living miserably to die incognitably. Bury me in the yard under the tiny pond.\nThe trip to the beach, symbolically, stands as the turning point that unchains the debacle. We are left with the white little socks of an elder who contemplates, nostalgic for something she hasn't lost yet, how her family, falling apart, is still able to laugh while they get soaked by the swing of the waves. That marine laughter redeems them with the gift of transitory oblivion. It must not be forgotten that, for people like this, fluctuating between tenderness and moral impairment, not remembering is, precisely, to live. The covered feet of the old woman sink into the sand while the salty air announces the darkest hour. Hatsue Shibata always knew everything and recognized, on the beautiful postcard facing the Pacific, that her role in this life was to operate as a containment dike whose cracks, in her view, would not resist much longer. With her final departure the luck would be cast. A real family would never treat you like that. \n\nWith the most heartbreaking epilogue I have seen in a long time, the film rises to unsuspected heights. Its greatest virtue lies in the universality that underlies the act of unmasking others and finding, behind their faces, a mirror. Kore-eda decides to go a little further giving us the story of a family whose members, to a greater or lesser degree, resemble all families. Through the work of the DoP, Ryûto Kondô, with a visual design inclined to the open and extreme long shots, we are given, through a delicate and tender lens, a small doorway into the intimacy of a family. By means of an exceptional exercise of the cinematographic technique, Kondô presents an eclectic richness in the use of full framings, medium shots and close-ups, with uninterrupted variations of low and high angles, as well as parallel tracking shots that involve us in the displacements of the characters. His camera captures the flowering of certain family relationships from the roofs, the lampposts, the fences of a parking lot (use of a crane), amplifying the immensity of those primary links that, at a distance, seem to strengthen as the film progresses. But also, making use of an outstanding inventiveness, he gives us beautiful perspectives from a dilapidated closet (or behind a door or window). With that in mind, we are dealing with interior poetics: from the interior of a house we move to the interior of a room, and, from this, to the interior of the furniture of that room. It is a metaphor of the film's plot pretensions, where photography shows us, sensually, an emotional path to access a labyrinth of interiorities. The happiness of a girl, victim of kidnapping, who smiles along with her new family when contemplating at a distance, between a small slit, the fireworks.\nI've read about out-of-touch-moralists who have dared to point out, with an accusing finger, the supposed flexibility in which citizen, work and family ethics are portrayed in the film. It seems that they haven't found out that in the real world, people of flesh and bone suffer from hunger and cold, to say the least. Advocacy of crime? Not at all, only that, if the author wishes, art could imitate life, and in this case, the work of Kore-eda stands out with mastery. Family nuclei, such as that embodied in the history of the Shibatas, swarm everywhere (if they are not the majority), and of a much less attentive and affectionate tendency. I will be told that the film, thus, becomes contradictory in its principles, since it is Shota himself who, suddenly, in the middle of an episode in which he seems to be assaulted by the kantian categorical imperative, decides to turn his back on the criminal activities of his family. It will be said that every human consciousness gets paralyzed by the perfidy of a father like Osamu, or the call of attention of a merchant who discovers that the kid was involving a girl, Yuri, even younger than him, in the shameful dynamic. Seems that attention has been dispersed in the most transcendental moments and it has not been understood how impregnable usually turns out to be that which precedes us. It is foolish to look for guilty in a universe in which, by overwhelming proportions, victims often act also as victimizers. There is a fierce battle between the name of the father and the homologation of the names of father and son, between the novel notion on private property of a child and the (unjustified) handling of guilt due the death of Yamatoya and his business' shutdown. Life itself has never allowed to be reduced to mere principles. What is in a store does not belong to anyone yet.\n\nWe have a child who despairs, overwhelmed by the anguish and the lack of answers, taking the decision to jump off a bridge while he was rushing trying to escape without getting caught after the usual supermarket theft. We see oranges rolling down the street thinking, perhaps, that such an outcome would be the exemplary consequence that such parents deserve. But to end this way would be to naively accept that the moralists were right by reducing the world to a blind binary conception of human actions. Let's rewind. Shota gets angry, in a fit of jealousy, because he feels his father privileges his new sister over him. He locks himself in an abandoned car, until his father, knowing where to find him, locates his whereabouts. Again: Shota despairs and jumps, we think that he has ended up with his own life, but no, he only has broken a leg. As happened to Osamu while he worked honestly. Is it perceived with clarity that the circle always ends up closed? In the epilogue, before our eyes follows a series of close-ups that show us the distorted faces of our usual defendants, Nobuyo and Osamu Shibata, worst parents of the universe. We see a mother touching her own forehead and head frantically, as if wanting to tear away with her nails the ideas that cause all the pain. Her grief is concentrated in the final dissolution of an ethereal fantasy. She lost her job and now she will lose her freedom for trying to keep together those who shared more than blood. We remember her tears as she held her own Lin (Yuri) between her arms, while burning the last garments given by the family that despised and assaulted the little girl. We replicate her question: Is it only mother who begets? Does it make you a mother automatically?\nOsamu's chilling sentence still echoes in our ears when trying to respond to the accusation in relation to his criminal behavior and the deviant consequences that this brought to his children's lives: I had nothing else to teach them. This is the only moderately satisfactory answer any parent can offer if manage, for a moment, to remove the moral bandage from its own eyes. I have nothing more to teach them... To us, the spectators, by force of dramatic tension, this blindfold have been violently snatched and we have seen a light that dazzles, approaching vertiginously. Yuri is just the iteration of Shota. Nobuyo and Osamu, had murdered the ex-husband of her, thus beginning their criminal life. The woman, who assumes -after previous agreement with her very coward partner- the total responsibility for the crime, is sterile. Aki, whose alter ego as a showgirl was Sayaka, has named herself (without knowing) after her true sister, Sayaka, and comes from a perfect family whose father is the son of the second marriage (of the woman who stole grandpa) that the late husband of our Hatsue had. Her family still lies (or not?) with the fact that their eldest daughter, Aki, is studying in Australia. They, with an ineffable guilt, always gave money to the grandmother (who spent it unfruitfully in the slots of a despicable casino), perhaps for the maintenance of the lost daughter, maybe not. And it does not matter. She believed that her grandmother had accepted her out of love. The fracture in the life of these characters is irreversible, and so ubiquitous, that it seems to touch with salt an open wound in the most intimate region of any family nuclei. We are not good enough for him.\nShota, finds out from his mother, that he was kidnapped as Yuri, but, in his case, from the back seat of a vehicle. Now he understands the reasons for his favorite hideout. His life, like the snowman he sculps with Osamu on the last night they share, is deformed and condensed into an unfathomable pain that, at his young age, tears apart the already fragile identity he thought was his. Nevertheless, he is still capable of stabbing the soul when -with vivid eyes- demands the official who assists him, a fact that, although modern social conventions make us believe is correct, becomes alarming: I thought that those who are going to school couldn't study at home. After hearing about the immediate future that awaits him, even with all the shelter he receives from state institutions, Shota's speech tears apart what is usually conceived as love and family responsibility. The kid's expression forces to recognize that, even though his family is a disaster, they shared everything with him. Shota, at such a young age, knows himself eternally a Shibata, and in a mutism forced by the noise of the collective automotive, after recognizing that he wanted to be caught, he turns his gaze towards Osamu, who runs without control after the bus that will separate him forever from his son, while drawing with his lips the most beautiful and lacerating word that could be said to that diminished man: ? ? ? ? (Ot?san = dad).\nShoplifters shows us a different but more palpable Japan than ever. A demystified nation, stripped of marketing and the omnipresent katanas of the Tokugawa Period. As if Commodore Perry, and the American military, had never imposed their will over the Japanese, since 1854. The movie isn't, naturally, the first cinematographic work that has achieve this, but it is careful enough to show that the homogenous conception of the West about the asian country is absolutely laughable. There are as many Japan as there are Japanese, and the misfortunes and tribulations suffered in this hemisphere are endured over there under the coordinates of their cultural context. Our children, in Latin America, hide their milk teeth under the pillow, waiting for the Ratoncito Pérez to pick them up during the night, while they sleep, leaving as a sign of barter a monetary sum. In English-speaking countries, for its part, they have the Tooth Fairy. In Japan, when the dental piece become detached from the upper section, it is customary to get it buried; but when it is of the lower area, it is usually thrown into the air -particularly to the roof[i]-, with the intention that the new tooth grows healthy and strong [ii]. In a context in which the sweet character of Father Coloma has not been able to penetrate, we are reminded that, in childhood, there are mythical stories more transcendental than those told by our parents or relatives in sleepless nights. We are talking about the living narrations, of flesh and bone, embodied in the beings we love and admire as children. When not even your mother wanted to have you, you become someone like us.\n\nTherefore, it is infertile to lecture on the intensity degrees of filial love, a fact that anguished Nobuyo deeply. Furthermore, it is a futility to aspire to quantify if the family that has been given to us, arbitrarily, is more loved than the one we choose, coming to it long after birth. For a child of Yuri's or Shota's age, anyone can be family if they receive from them an affective and respectful treatment... anyone. Even a thief. If insisted on ignoring such an elementary and foundational premise of the human psyche, there will only remain the recalcitrant grief of a lonely girl, already forgotten by her abusive father and her abused mother, who with a tender voice recites us the songs of numbers (to learn to count) taught by the monstrous family that kidnapped her for months (making her feel loved). There shall be left her sweet polychrome sketches of a visit to the beach. The candid melancholy of such a girl, seems to want to please the vertigo while holding the railing of a balcony that resembles where everything started. In her retina, the memory of feeling part of something still sparkles, despite the fact that she lived so far away then from her real family... In her memory, the immortal flight of his brother Shota still gleams...",

There's grandma, her 20-something granddaughter, a married couple, and the husband's pre-teen son, who sleeps in what appears to be a small storage cabinet. The husband and wife both work but money is tight. To make ends meet, the father and son regularly shoplift together, which not only puts food on the table, but also serves as an enjoyable bonding experience. \n\nOn the way home from one such expedition, the two spot a little girl outside in the cold. They invite her home for a hot meal and plan to return her later that night, but when they overhear her parents fighting about her and notice that she's covered with burn scars, they decide to just keep her. Soon she's part of the family, tagging along on shoplifting trips and slurping noodles on the floor with the rest of them.\n\nThe theme of \"Shoplifters\" is kind of like that saying that you can pick your nose but you can't pick your family, except the opposite. Or sort of the opposite. Not only can you pick your family but presumably you can also pick your nose, which couldn't possibly be any grosser than the noise the father makes when he slurps noodles.\n\nIt's always best to go into movies with low expectations, but unfortunately I'd been looking forward to this one for a few weeks after seeing a preview and was a little bit disappointed. By the end of the film I'd accumulated a whole list of niggling loose ends that had confused me along the way and were never really cleared up. \n\nAdd to that one of those super-abrupt endings that are almost always annoying. I'm OK with Tony Soprano eating onion rings as \"Don't Stop Believing\" plays and his daughter ineptly parallel parks but this is no Tony Soprano eating onion rings or even Tony Soprano slurping noodle soup. It's more like, OK, I think I'll just randomly stop filming now.  \n\nBam. Fin. Or whatever \"fin\" is in Japanese.",

            "content": "Hirokazu Kore-eda has been heralded as an unsung hero of current direction, a modern day Yasujiro Ozu, who has seen success both in his home country of Japan and overseas. His new picture, Shoplifters, has garnered widespread critical acclaim, winning the coveted Palme D'Or at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival.\nHaving seen this film, I can only say that Shoplifters is thoroughly deserving of its praise; here, Kore-eda has succeeded in crafting a subtle, yet affecting film, detailing the story of a band of marginalised thieves, forced to shoplift to get by in a poverty-stricken corner of Tokyo.\nWhat is perhaps most striking about Shoplifters is how it manages to be so profound, yet at the same time being so understated. Like many of the director's films, family lies at the heart of this, though in often darker and more twisted ways than one might expect. Osamu (played with a Fagin-esque edge by Lily Franky) and his wife, Nobuyo (a captivating Sakura Ando) are exploitative both in their relationship with the elderly Hatsue (Kirin Kiki), whose pension they abuse, and with the young waifs they take in (kidnap or save?; this is left suitably ambiguous). There is a definite air of darkness that hangs about the film, yet, even in the bleakest moments, there is a tenderness too, with many scenes showing the endearing ways in which the \"family\" bond with and depend on eachother, especially after taking in the abused youngster, Yuri (Miyu Sasaki).\n\nThe picture is also beautifully shot, Ryuto Kondo's artistic cinematography assuaging the drama and aiding the film's subtlety and beauty. Most scenes are long and languid, the dialogue effortless and naturalistic and executed by a talented and, even against the odds, likeable ensemble.\n Credit should also be given to Shoplifters for never glossing over its themes; young Aki's employment in a hostess club and the abuse suffered by Yuri lie in the background, understated, yet profoundly affecting. The themes of the film are complex, blurring the lines of morality and responsibility, yet it never feels heavy; Kore-eda is letting the his audience form their own opinion about the issues represented. What Shoplifters may lack in clear plot, it makes up for in rich and fleshed out characters and sharp writing, which ranges from witty to silently poignant. The film rambles a little in a more cluttered third act, but this is made up by an utterly heart-breaking coda.\nWith Shoplifters, Hirokazu Kore-eda has crafted a near perfect picture, elegantly executed and quietly moving, with an important and incredibly human message at its core.",

            "content": "This year's Palme d'Or winner is also my first experience with director Kore-eda Hirokazu. Combining European arthouse sentiments and a neo-realist approach, I totally understand why he has such a great track record with Western critics. Here, he etched out an intimate and contemplative portrait of a bunch of people marginalized by society who band together to form a make-shift family struggling to survive financially and emotionally by whatever means possible. They are generally good, though desperate, people, and the film proves this by having them take in a seemingly abandoned young girl out of the goodness of their hearts. The slow building first half will require your patience, good thing it's sporadically amusing but it's also deliberately confusing. Interestingly and cleverly, Hirokazu does not explain right away how these people are related or how they got together. This becomes the mystery that drives the film and as the story pivots after a predictably tragic event (signposted a little too obviously), the second half gathers momentum with the revelations that the audience has been craving for but which sadly also brings about their unravelling. This is where the film works best as it elegantly stitches together the story of their extraordinary journey they have made as a family unit. Even though not everything is properly explained (partly could be lost in translation) or tied up neatly in the end, the bittersweet ending is no less satisfying or emotional for it. The acting feels authentic and the child actors are far from precocious which also helps. This is a well composed and thoughtful film that will appeal to an audience who likes a bit of Loach and Leigh in their cinematic diet.",

This is a beautiful slice-of-life story that examines and deconstructs the term family by giving us the best cinematic family in the history of film. I felt as if I just met this family both as a group and individually owing to impressive character development and attention to detail. The acting is fantastic, all of their relationships are wonderfully conveyed and the film finds the beautiful and the funny in the ordinary. It's a long movie that is engaging throughout and filled with memorable, all very subtle, nuanced scenes. It's an admirably naturalistic, humanistic and deeply touching film that is one of the rare movies that actually moved me to tears in its heartbreaking ending.",

It has since gone on to win 11 other awards and was recently nominated by the Golden Globes for Best Foreign Language Motion Picture.\n\nThe merit for all these accolades isn't immediately apparent to audiences when initially delving into the picture, which features a small but close-knit family unit reliant on shoplifting and other petty crimes to survive.\n\nHowever, the film becomes more and more engrossing as the ties that bond the characters together are further tested and examined.  Additionally, since domestic audiences aren't familiar with the actors, it lends an incredible amount of authenticity to their roles, further amplified by writer/director Hirokazu Koreeda's impeccable camera placement.\n\nIn the end, this isn't a film that leaves you either exhilarated or exhausted when exiting the theater.  Contemplative, perhaps, is the best way to describe it, lingering well beyond when the other emotions have already faded away.",
