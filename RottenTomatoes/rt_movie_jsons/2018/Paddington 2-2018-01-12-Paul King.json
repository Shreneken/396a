Every once in a while, normally every day, i devour my marmalade sandwich whilst re watching the queens jubilee scene with paddington bear wishing i was her meeting my idol, my love and saviour, my reason for breathing and the bear i consider home. i always look forward to wearing my blue raincoat and red booties and matching red floppy bucket hat (keeping up with the indie girls) on my daily walks in the burning hot summers of southern Arizona. through paddington 2 i have embraced my British culture and love for bears. live laugh love paddington. would obviously give this film more ten five stars as i recommend the film to any organism that has access to the internet. this one is for you paddy, sincerely paddington's biggest fan and platonic best friend. - Regina B",

I always have a little difficulty with a film that creates a CGI bear and then relies on a whole host of well-known but slightly forgotten actors to beef up the plot. In this case, the plot was slightly daft and the story a little silly. However, as a man in my 50s what was I doing watching this anyway? I am certain that for children this film would be a five-star plus so I feel that this time my review is a little biased. One for the kids, the type of film that they will adore but I was brought up in the 70s and when I was 5 I watched the old animation series of the same name. Again not my era but more modern kids would be like honey to a bee or marmalade to bread. Don't take my word for this one just give it a try but do bring a few under 10s with you so that they can explain the humour as the time passes.",

I like the family friendly nature it has, some witty dialogue and word based puns, I loved that there were more sub-plots present in this sequel and I also loved that there were, if anything, more well known actors (mostly British, of course) featured in this follow up film (Hugh Grant, Ben Miller etc.). There are some action based scenes which I enjoyed and I found it a thoroughly entertaining. amusing family friendly watch, which isn't needlessly dumbed down just to appeal to children, like some films can be. I would thoroughly recommend this to others, as a good example of a British family based comedy. In my opinion, its worth seeing for Hugh Grants scenes alone frankly!.",

It's just so damn warm, fuzzy and tugs at heart strings you thought long lost at puberty! Paddington is a british institution and everyone in this movie knows it and you literally feel the love pouring out of the screen right down the little animated shorts done in the style of the legendary 1970's cartoon/live action mixed show. Hugh Grant is having the time of his life and arguably gives his greatest ever performance taking the camp level to 11 and his wardrobe with it. I love the first movie but if you want to know what British-ness is all about, watch Paddington 2 or the bear will give you his disappointed look....",

            "content": "Loved the first 'Paddington', was not sure whether that would be the case but it turned out to be one of that year's biggest surprises and delights. Was enthused about hearing that there was a sequel with the same crew returning, always a plus when it comes to sequels, but there was the concern as to whether it would fall victim to \"sequel-titis\".\n\nVery luckily, 'Paddington 2' does not fall victim to that. It is one of not many sequels to actually be equal in quality to its predecessor and come close to being even better. It maintains all of 'Paddington's' heart, fun and charm, maintaining everything that made that film so good, and even builds on that appeal. For such a hit-and-miss year and seeing my fair share of overblown big-budget blockbusters with little soul, films that waste great premises and films that attempted laugh-a-minute laughs and doing it in a way that came at the expense of heart, 'Paddington 2' was a much needed refreshment. Not saying at all that it has been a completely bad year, actually there have been very good to great films, just that 'Paddington 2' stood out in the best of ways in recent weeks.\n\nMaybe it could have been ever so slightly longer and would have again liked to have seen more of Mr Curry and his acrimonious relationship with Paddington. Everything else is magic.\n\n'Paddington 2' once again looks great. It's beautifully shot and vibrant in design with a little bit of grit and Paddington as to be expected couldn't have looked more perfect. The music score is suitably soothing, rousing and whimsical, while the direction keeps things moving at a bright and breezy pace. A pace that never slows down but doesn't ever feel too hasty either.\n\nScripting is also spot on. The comedic moments are incredibly funny, the best of it hilarious, with rapid-fire wit, endearing quirkiness, clever gags that don't feel like pale retreads of before and perfectly pitched misunderstandings and physical comedy. Underneath all the humour and the darker and more suspenseful mystery/action-oriented elements of the story is a big heart and strong emotional core, with some lovely inspiring messaging and values that are very much current and some touching parts. It's also incredibly intelligent, not many films this year have treated its audience with the amount of respect that 'Paddington 2' has, and has such an endearing innocence.\n\nA large part of that is the character of Paddington himself. Can't fault his design or Ben Whishaw's beautiful voice acting, nor can one fault his truly adorable personality, absolutely love how he tries to still remain even in the grimmest of situations and he is easy to root for and love throughout. The story may on the slight side structurally but has a lot going on, without being cluttered, that makes it very much eventful and to me there weren't any tonal issues.\n\nEvery ounce of the heart, charm and fun seen in 'Paddington' is here and everybody gets a chance to shine, especially Mr Brown and Mrs Bird of Paddington's family. The new characters are great additions, with a superior villain and the character of the cook Knuckles being one of the film's nicest surprises. Only Mr Curry could have been done better.\n\nPerformances across the board are great. Hugh Bonneville balances comedy and drama with ease, Sally Hawkins is compassionate and Julie Walters is a hoot. Jim Broadbent is always a welcome presence and the younger actors are appealing. Brendan Gleeson excels in a departure role, a dramatic actor in a more comedic role in a family-friendly film could have gone wrong but Gleeson brings a curmudgeonly charm and great comic timing. Hugh Grant is also cast against type and brilliantly sends up himself and the world of acting. This is Paddington's film though.\n\nOverall, an absolute delight and refreshing. 9/10 Bethany Cox",
