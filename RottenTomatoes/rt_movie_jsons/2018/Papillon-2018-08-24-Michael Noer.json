And even though Charlie Human lost 40 pounds for this role, he still looks incredible for someone that has been in solitary confinement for years. Even the relationship between the two lead characters feels strained, the filmmakers could have developed it much better. It's all in the details and with this movie those details are missing.",

When you take away the charisma and chemistry of Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman, the incredible score by Jerry Goldsmith and the sheer scale of the original's memorable opening scenes, what is left is a drab vanilla remake. \nCharlie Hunnam is a competent and likeable actor still in search of a director who can tap into his screen persona. Rami Malik lacks any character depth and keeps reminding the viewer of what a magnetically watchable actor Dustin Hoffman was.\nThere is no excitement, no chemistry between the two leads and no humour.\nMy recommendation is to not waste your time on this leaden remake and seek out Franklin J. Schaffner's original version.",

Hunnam is solid, sells it, and obviously dedicated to the part while Malek is charming, oddly endearing, and the point of the dynamic that forces us to genuinely engage. There is an epic sense to the execution here and the entertainment factor is large if not somewhat distant, but I'd hoped we might be instilled more into the minds of these characters and how they dealt with the confinement and quiet more so than the film accomplishes.

The groundbreaking 1973 version featured two stars at their peak, but die-hard fans aside, this one (which I saw first) makes some story improvements and the actors shine in their own ways. \n\nThe truth is, both movies could have picked up minutes better used for more character development. For example, we should have seen a glimpse of what Dega accomplishes on his own. The final scenes feel a bit rushed, and I feel unsure where Dega is coming from..\n\nHowever, in spite of the films flaws, Rami Malek's Dega stirs both Papillon and the audience with his physical and emotional utter vulnerability, as well as his startling strengths. Hunnam's Papi might not be as iconic as McQeen's, but his character feels equally steely and driven, yet warmer. I find their unspoken but palpable bond more engaging than the original, making us root for them that much more and bringing life to the bleakness of the story. (Which makes one care less that the story's not exactly true.) \n\nIf you have any interest in the underside of history, survival stories of grit and wit, or either of these actors, definitely worth it. If not, you may just get sucked in anyway.",

Papillon is a gritty, grim, and strong biographical drama film about Henri (Papillon) played by Charlie Hunnam being imprisoned on a notorious devil's island in 1933. The film does get grim seeing these prisoners being starved, beaten, and put into a breaking point until they are insane. It does get a little graphic with prisoners harassing the weak. Guards and wardens trying to break the prisoners. The plot was decent feeling a little dull at times. Besides it is based on a true story of Henri Charriere actual memoir of the events he encountered with being beaten, trying to protect another prisoner, and escaping. And getting captured to be placed on devil's island. Henri is a skilled thief. A safecracker. Working for the criminal organization. When he is wanting out and gets framed for murder. He is sent to devils island for life. He meets a counterfeiter Louis (Rami Malek) who is rich. And has some money with him that can buy his protection. Henri and Louis try to plot their escape on a broken down boat. But gets captured again and placed in a confined room for years until they are back on the island. Which nearly looked every prisoner is broken down, feeling hopeless, and losing their minds from starvation, isolation, ect. Charlie Hunnam was decent with playing Henri. Rami Malek was good playing Louis. The emotions with these characters as Henri and Louis looking out towards the sea for freedom was sad and heartening. I did not like the beginning of the movie with Henri being that slick safecracker. And walking to a club in France. Every thing seemed a bit rushed with the first 15 minutes of the movie. He is working for some mobster in breaking through safes. He gets drunk and falls in love with one of the clubs dancers. And they walk around the city of France having a good time and messing around like teenagers. And Henri wakes up in a hotel room until they get interrupted with the police arresting him for murder. The beginning felt rushed and cheesy. It does get better from there. Overall, Papillon is a fair drama film. Plot was okay. Charlie Hunnam and Rami Malek gave a good performance. The gritty tone was emotional and powerful. Even if the movie had a cheesy rushed beginning.",

In the trailer there is a line where Henri Charriere (Charlie Hunam) calls Louis Dega (Rami Malek) his friend, before defending him from a fellow inmate. That line isn't in the movie. It's subtle things like that, but at least they were able to share a hug together. For Pete's sake, men are allowed to be affectionate towards their friends. It's not that hard.",

            "content": "Based on the international best-selling autobiography, \"Papillon\" brings the epic story of Henri \"Papillon\" Charri\u00e8re (Charlie Hunnam) back to the screen with a gritty and violent streak. It's a dark and sometimes horrific tale of an innocent man who is framed for a murder he didn't commit and sentenced to life in the notorious prison on Devil's Island in French Guiana. It's also arguably an unnecessary remake of Franklin J. Schaffner's 1973 feature starring Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman.\n\nRami Malek steps into the role of convicted counterfeiter Louis Dega, with his trademark creep / quirk appeal working overtime. Malek sells his role as a wealthy artistic type who understands what he needs to do to survive in prison. After another rich prisoner is gruesomely murdered on his first night in the brink, Dega forms an alliance with Papillon. The Parisian safecracker agrees to serve as Dega's protector in exchange for money to finance his escape plan.\n\nThe film is well-acted with effective performances (although the scenes near the end of the film feel a little hokey). The project was shot in chronological order, and you can see and feel the stress of filming on the actors as the movie progresses. They look just as worn down as their characters, and it's clearly visible in their performances. Audiences may start feel worn down too, especially when the multiple attempts at a prison break begin to feel repetitive. Thankfully the cast keeps things engaging and interesting despite the two hour plus run time. The film starts out in Paris during the 1930s and closes in the late 1960s. It's a sprawling story that's slow-moving and dragged out a bit too long, yet director Michael Noer manages to build upon the suspense.\n\nThe superstar here is composer David Buckley's score, a melancholy soundtrack that perfectly reflects the overall mood of the film. It's among my favorites of the year.\n\nIf you're a fan of escape films, the lead actors, or of the original material on which it's based, you'll likely enjoy this version of \"Papillon.\"",

Especially those that are thought of as classics or have had unforgettable leads?\n\n6) Does adding more violence and/or more nude males in prison make a movie better?\n\n7) Though I am not familiar with previous works of Charlie Hunnam he does express a lot with just his face and emotions he is feeling but, right now, he is not quite the Steve McQueen of the 1973 original \"Papillon\".\n\nObviously, my thoughts strayed as I was watching the movie or turning my head away with some of the gratuitous violence but the bottom line is the story screenplay and none of the actors drew me into the movie to knock those thoughts out of my head.\n\nThe next remake coming up is \"A Star Is Born\" starring Bradley Cooper, who also directed, and Lady Gaga. I have seen and am a fan of the original and the two remakes, each for different reasons, and am hoping this new version will be the exception to the rule about remakes and be their equivalent.\n\nThe bottom line is I found \"Papillon\" a bore and would suggest you watch the original as that is a film that Hollywood doesn't make, a two-star action prison film epic that you really believed happened.",

Because at the end of the 1st one he is captured again and has to go through more struggles and more issues than previously \n\nI have seen this movie before then it was much better the 1st time Dustin Hoffman amazing and you simply cannot replace Steve McQueen AKA THE KING OF COOL.

They were especially impressive in regard with how they worked together; it was interesting to watch their companionship blossom throughout the movie, beginning shaky but quickly becoming an unbreakable bond. However, despite how close they appeared at one time, I was still on edge when they were put in a tight spot because it felt either one of them could have turned on each other any moment. The atmosphere created by the production crew, specifically in the prison, was authentic and brutal; they truly created a hell on Earth. The score from David Buckley does a good job building on the emotion of scenes, especially towards the end where it plays a big role. \nThe only real criticism I have with the film is its length. There is one sequence where Hunnam finds himself in solitary confinement which I felt went on a little too long and could've been done differently, either shorter or more eventful. Otherwise I found myself very invested in the characters and story. \nSince I have not seen the original I cannot compare the two versions, but I can say the newer release is very well crafted. I recommend this film to those who enjoy prison movies and those who liked last year's Lost City of Z (another period piece starring Hunnam).",
