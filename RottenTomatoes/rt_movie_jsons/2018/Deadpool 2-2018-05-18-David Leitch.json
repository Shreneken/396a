            "content": "In many ways an example of a typical movie sequel. Deadpool was great and Deadpool 2 tried to one-up it by being bigger while relying too much on references to the first movie. To its credit, it tries a different direction when it comes to the heart of the story though I found it significantly less effective. Deadpool 2 is still a funny and entertaining action movie, but don't expect any more than that.",

The film is jam-packed with action, humor, and pop culture references that are sure to please fans of the character. However, while there are plenty of laughs and thrilling set pieces, some of the jokes fall flat and the plot can feel a bit formulaic at times. Overall, if you're a fan of Deadpool or superhero movies in general, you'll likely enjoy Deadpool 2, but it may not quite live up to the high bar set by its predecessor.",

Sure, the plot does feel a bit all over the place and there's a lot of new characters, but it manages to ultimately pull it off like a bowl of perfectly executed spaghetti meatballs - messy but darn good. The latter scenes of the third act did come off as a bit odd to me and it certainly felt as if the director got a bit lazy towards the end. Deadpool can come off as a tad exhausting at times, but again that is overshadowed by the broader positive aspects of the film.  That Jared Kushner line was probably the one thing that made me laugh out loud out of the two movies; that and the topographical map of Utah line. Altogether, it's an excellent film.",

There's plenty of wisecracks made - random questions and the like (references to Yentl and Dub Step being 2 examples) and the CGI is pretty impressive. There are some good chase scenes too. It's a film to switch off and enjoy but nothing more. I'm not a particular fan of superhero films as such overall - I've liked a few but I'm by no means an expert in the area, although I did think it was a bit amusing how the central character references characters from other comic book-based film franchises (this is a Marvel Studios film and he references DC, as in DC comics etc.). Suffice to say, I wouldn't recommend letting younger teens watch this, as it is pretty heavy on bloody violence but then if you know anything about the character then that's hardly a surprise and indeed it's been given the 15 rating in the UK (you have to be 15 to see it). The cast is pretty good and its an entertaining watch, so I'd recommend it on that basis, yes.",

        {
            "content": "I'm gonna say it, \"Deadpool 2\" is my favorite comic book movie of all time. hell, it goes on the top 3 movies of all time list for me or even my favorite movie of all time. because i love \"Deadpool 2\" a lot. Every scene is executed perfectly and puts a smile on my face throughout the entirety of \"Deadpool 2\". (Even 1 of the posters for \"Deadpool 2\" says \"From The Studio Who Killed Wolverine) I can't say that there are any unnecessary scenes or scenes that go on for too long. because for me, \"deadpool 2\" is the perfect movie that i can recommend to anyone without delay. There are so many great things about this movie that I love about it, that I don't know where to start. \n\nFirstly, the jokes go from excellent to peak comedy. There is 1 joke towards the end of the movie where deadpool tells cable to \"zip it thanos\" and cable's actor actually played thanos in infinity war and endgame (and that said actor being Josh Brolin) makes the joke so much more funnier. And speaking of that joke, \"Deadpool 2\"'s humor does not disintegrate in terms of who they go after. Like they go after other marvel characters (Zip it black black widow) and (give me a bow and arrow and i am basically hawkeye), they go after the DC Universe (You're so dark, i wonder your from the DC universe) and even pop culture references (keep your hand off of that child, john connor). There is even a scene where Deadpool and firefist call out Colossus for stealing a line from \"Robocop\". There are plenty of jokes I am leaving out because you need to experience hearing those jokes for yourself, they are that good. \n\nSecondly, the music choice for this movie is excellent in \"Deadpool 2\". Its music choice shows that this movie can be emotional and funny at the same time. Like during 1 emotional, slow-motion scene at the end, they play \"Tomorrow\" from \"Annie\". Which is hilarious because of the song choice but, also fits the scene because of the emotional context it has now because of what it's playing over. And then, the next scene uses an acoustic version of \"Take On Me\" by \"a-ha\" which is extremely well done and adds this emotional context to the song that wouldn't have been there if that context wasn't there. Also this version of \"Take On Me\" makes you realize the lyrics and the meaning of those lyrics in this acoustic version of \"Take On Me\". which you would have probably missed if you listened to the normal version of  \"Take On Me\". They Also use dubstep as a running joke in the movie. After watching \"Deadpool 2\" makes me want to listen to more dubstep because dubstep sounds so cool to me. Another Well done scene for me was the intro where deadpool goes around the world and kills some bad guys and they put on dolly parton's \"9 to 5\" which again works really well here. Same with the into. They got Celine Delion to sing an original theme for \"Deadpool 2\". Which makes \"Deadpool 2\"'s intro more like a James Bond intro. (which is what they are trying to parody here.) and that is perfect for this type of film, where it makes fun of superhero and general movie tropes/clich\u00e9s. \n\nThirdly, the characters and the casting choices for these characters are once again, perfect. Like everyone knows that Ryan Reynolds was born to play Wade Willson/Deadpool. Also, Ryan Reynolds plays the voice of Juggernaut in \"Deadpool 2\". Which was a nice surprise to see. Next, Josh Brolin was also perfect in this movie and gave off a lot of that terminator vibes with his character and his performance. and, Morena Baccarin as Vanessa was good, despite the short screen time she is given in \"Deadpool 2\". Julian Dennison as Firefist killed it with his performance. No matter what scene he was in. Also Zazie Beetz As Domino, T.J. Miller as Weasel, Leslie Uggams as Blind Al, Karan Soni as Dopinder, Brianna Hildebrand as Negasonic Teenage Warhead, Shioli Kutsuna as Yukio, Rob Delaney as Peter and Stefan Kapicic as Colossus were very good in their performances here. 2 surprising casting choices were a Brad Pitt cameo as Vanisher and Pennywis-, I mean Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd as Zeitgeist. (also, his role in the movie is very fitting to his past performances, especially the \"It\" Reboot and its sequel). Both Brad Pitt and Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd are excellent, despite their short screen time. \n\nFourthly, I just want to say \"Deadpool 2\" has the best post-credits of any movie of all time. They even go to \"X-men origins: Wolverine\" and the time when Ryan Reynolds received the script for the green lantern movie and there is even an extra scene in the post credits scene in the super duper $@%!#& cut (which i didn't see) which was really funny and surprised that they didn't put the theatrical cut of \"Deadpool 2\". \n\nIn Conclusion, \"Deadpool 2\" I would recommend to everyone (hell, it even says it's a family film as a joke or foreshadowing the existence of \"Once Upon A Deadpool\") and this film is oscar-worthy for me. I Know that \"Deadpool 2\" Isn't For Everyone, But, I think everyone should give \"Deadpool 2\" a watch.",

            "content": "It is not very common for highly successful superhero movies that explore a new genre have an equally successful sequel. Superman and Superman II, Iron Man and Iron Man 2, Man of Steel and Batman v Superman, there are plenty of examples where a great movie is followed by a mediocre or even a bad sequel. But this one is definitely not one of them. Rather I like Deadpool 2 more than its prequel. Since the previous movie was more set up in order to give an origin story and have the regular good guy vs bad guy fight, it did not have much time to explore over its humour. And this is exactly where Deadpool 2 does the job.\n\nThe story revolves around Wade Wilson once again with his popping over his wife's death by a bunch of mercenaries and alongside that he is trying to save a boy from becoming a supervillain and getting killed by Cable. This movie it takes itself very lightly just like the prequel and breaks the fourth wall continuously as the story passes by. There is even a joke on Josh Brolin playing the role of cable as Deadpool says, \"Suck it, Thanos!\". Multiple comic scenes take place throughout the movie e which include the formation of the X-Force, Deadpool being made an X-Men trainee and no one taking him seriously, Wade Wilson been sent to prison, Deadpool fighting Cable and releasing all the mutants only to be ripped in half by Juggernaut and Deadpool growing out as a baby from the bottom half.\n\nThe action scenes of this movie are even better than the previous one. I really like the scene from the beginning of the movie where Deadpool is fighting a bunch of Yakuzas in Osaka. The camera revolves around Deadpool as he slices down all the man who have come to save the leader. When juggernaut and colossus are about to fight Deadpool says, \"Big CGI fight coming up!\". When he is about to fight cable for the first time, Cable ask him who he is to which he replies, \"I am Batman!\". Overall there are multiple action comedy scenes sprinkled all across the movie.\n\nThe movie also gives an important message, which is not something we normally see in an X-Men movie. Deadpool tells Russell to let the headmaster live, as killing him would send him on the path of villainy from which it will be impossible to come back. Instead of Russell Deadpool chooses to take the bullet from Cable and his death becomes the reason why Russell chooses to give up killing and become a good person instead. This also saves Cable's family from dying and he can go back in peace. But soon afterwards that message is discarded after the headmaster is run over by Dopinder's taxi, thus fulfilling his dream of becoming a contract killer.\n\nDeadpool 2, being the movie for a mature audience as it is, is hard to think of home to watch with, considering such a movie cannot be watched with the family and friends have watched it anyway. This is the reason why it's a good thing they decided to make a sequel of this movie and connect it to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. If Dark Phoenix and The New Mutants were not made, this could have been the most perfect way to culminate the X-Men franchise and merge it with the remaining Marvel Cinematic Universe. I can't wait to watch more of this.",

Before watching this film, I thought that Deadpool would not be able to offer something new in the sequel (as it is), but this is not the main thing, the main thing is that the creators took into account the mistakes of the first film and rehabilitated them in the second without being torn between psychological drama and black comedy, but purely creating a black comedy, not guaranteeing that the output will be something great, but about everything in order ...\n\nGet away, romance!\n\nIf the previous plot of the film was built on Wade's uneven and superficial love for ... (I forgot it already), then in this film the creators decided to focus on the main character, on his redemption. Immortal Wade, who does not think that his immortality does not apply to those he loves, loses his fate for a happy life. The writers begin, for the most part, to focus on the inner torment of the protagonist, and not try to squeeze sour juice out of unnecessary romance. More indicative, in terms of the quality of the film, are the opening credits, which, unlike the original, make fun of at least something (films about 007), which makes us understand that a reckless black comedy awaits us (and this happens after the tragedy with the hero), which already says the viewer \"do not worry about anything\".\n\nSecondary heroes have a place to be!\n\nIf an ordinary viewer wondered when watching the first film about the senselessness of the abundance of secondary characters appearing in the plot, just as a panorama for the mainstream, then in the second part, they are exactly in the places in which they should be. Someone brings the main character intimate friendship and love, revealing Deadpool from a positive side (Colossus, Cable, an old woman, a Mexican kid), and someone serves as a method of mockery of modern trends (Force X group, Warhead with an Asian lesbian, taxi driver) ... A bespectacled man with outhouse humor is still not needed in the film, but with such an abundance of colorful characters, he has a place to get lost. In general, one feels that all these characters are not indifferent to the main character (given his tragedy), which is why they automatically become not indifferent to us.\n\nThe authors are still egg-free.\n\nThe creators don't want to take risks. The film is still built on a stereotyped principle, like any superhero movie, but only in a funky manner and is perfectly aware of this, unlike the first film, which makes it better. But, he is also afraid to step aside and show the viewer an extravagant new thing that would revolutionize the idea of \u200b\u200bcomic-book films. The only thing left is to hope that the authors will do their best in the third film (hopefully, in the final one), but for now, we still have another sequel, which has learned to correctly prioritize.\n\nOutcome\n\nI love Deadpool. If the first film introduced me to this character at all and interested him, then the second film began to show him in all its glory. As a result, we got a solid black comedy with beer and chips.\n\n7 out of 10",

Ryan Reynolds is a very charismatic person, but that does not mean that automatically all of his characters must be direct hits with audience. I felt like Deadpool 2 was probably a lot of fun for the cast and crew to make, but not much fun to watch. It is the worst movie I have seen Josh Brolin in, ever. The very fact that this movie succeeded shows that all people want from super hero movies is, cheap comedy, and fights. This being said the ending was emotional touching, but it was cheap and the audience knew they were being manipulated. I don't want to dislike this movie, but I just don't like it, except for maybe the last 10 minutes.",

I mean, this felt EXACTLY like it was a prelude to Hunt for the Wilderpeople. Like, as soon as this movie ends, if you watch HFTW, it flows. Weird, but I love it.) Josh Brolin as an even darker character than Thanos (at first) was great. I loved Zazie Beetz, as well. Hilarious, heartbreaking, explosive fun with a surprisingly touching story. The anti-religious thing was so blatant that it made me cringe and it didn't fit in with the movie at all.

This is way way better than the original film, it had everything I wanted from deadpool even though the family theme was so 2017. Aka Lego Batman and fast and furious makes this movie, both 2017 movies. This movie gave me a more emotional deadpool, a family man after losing a beloved person in his life. Now let's talk about the real star in this movie, none other than the person who plays domino, zazie betez or something like that. Domino is wonderful in this movie but I wanted a little bit more, she can kick some serious stuff and everything about her character is phenomenal. Every scene she's in ,she in my opinion steals the show. Next up Peter, man, they killed Peter except psych he comes back in the post credits but you know who doesn't come back, everybody on x force except dead pool, domino, and you guessed it now Peter. Everybody died just like infinity war. Thanos himself aka cable was buff and dark. I can't wait to see what's next but before I sign off I gotta talk about what I hated about this film. No stan flipping lee and barely any xmen. Just the one little cameo. Disney or universal, whoever buys fox needs to make an xmen deadpool movie.",

The cinematography and soundtrack were still good, and the visual effects were fine but could have been better in places. The action was decent although must of the fighting happened at the beginning. The acting was all right, but the original characters were better. The plot was mostly predictable and nothing new besides some stupid elements such as the X-Force bit.

This movie is amazing, taking the many facets of the word family and showcasing them all in a single film. Domino's abilities are very well displayed, watching her mutant ability in action was quite satisfying. This film is filled with Easter Eggs and references, but my personal favorite is when he returns to the apartment, we see the bag labelled as The Cure for Blindness.

            "content": "In 2016, the first movie proved to producers that a R-rated Superhero film could be viable, making over $ 780 million at the box office. Hilariously rude and imaginative, DEADPOOL was like no other comic book film before. Ryan Reynolds inhabits the character to perfection, making him a lovable wise-ass, that just happens to be a ruthless contract killer. But it insistently refuses to take its ''hero'' seriously, which is one of the main charm of the film.\n\nIn fact, both DEADPOOL movies rest on Ryan Reynolds' shoulders. His obvious passion for the character is communicative, and it would be hard to imagine someone else inhabiting the character with such gusto. And inhabiting may be the right word; Reynolds has been a producer on both films, and owns personally one of the costume that he gleefully wears at any occasion to promote the films, creating viral videos and surprise appearances as Deadpool that demonstrate a level of commitment to a character which is rare in motion pictures. He literally bought into the Merc with a Mouth lock, stock and barrel.\n\nAnd this passion pays off. He obviously has fun with the character, and the audience gleefully tags along for the wild ride. Written by the same team which tackled the 2016 original, with the addition of Reynolds himself, DEADPOOL 2 boasts the same healthy dose of self-referential and even self deprecating humor, numerous pulp culture references, and outrageous action scenes with somewhat ribald slow-motion moments. The strong identity of  Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick' script is such that you hardly feel the difference in direction. DEADPOOL director Tim Miller, after having some of those pesky ''creative differences'' with Reynolds (allegedly over who should play Cable), left the sequel to focus on rebooting the TERMINATOR franchise for James Cameron. The directing job then went to Stuntman David Leitch who had directed some scenes for the impressive JOHN WICK, and made his feature directing debut with ATOMIC BLONDE. \n\nThe film certainly does not lack energy, yet loses a bit of steam during Deadpool's incarceration in a maximum security prison for super-powered perps, as his depression over the loss of his girlfriend, assassinated at the beginning of the film, tends to drag down the film in a direction that feels somewhat lacking. After the High-Octane craziness of the first film, the attempts to make Wilson more human by having him moping around about his lost love or caring about saving the life of a kid feels forced. There's nothing wrong with a bit of virtue in our heroes, but it seems a bit out of place with Deadpool. Then again, it does help the character to move away from his ''creep'' status, so it may not be a bad idea. Just not subtle. Yet Deadpool is not exactly where you go for subtlety, so...\n\nThe cast, lead of course by an enthusiastic Ryan Reynolds, is top notch. Josh Brolin manages to bring a certain amount of rough around the edges depth to the time-traveling Cable, exuding the same kind of rugged charm that even transpired in his motion captured role as Thanos in last month's AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR. Zazie Beets owns the screen as Domino, whose unusual super-power of just been lucky leads to some of the best action sequences of the film. Young Kiwi actor Julian Dennison, who stole Taika (THOR RAGNAROK) Waititi's HUNT FOR THE WILDERPEOPLE from co-star Sam Neill, continues to demonstrate his considerable talent for both drama and comedy as the troubled Firefist, and his pugnacious attitude is the only thing making Deadpool's obsession with saving him feel not as maudlin. \n\nI could talk about the casting for the team formed by Deadpool to accomplish this mission, X-FORCE, but suffice it to say that they have one killer scene in the film that surprisingly made me glad to see a live action rendition of characters I tend to find aggressively uninteresting on the page. It's an actual highlight of the film. Nuff said.\n\nIn the end, this may be just another R-Rated, big-budget, avocado-faced, butt-grabbin'\", rip-snortin', gun-tottin', pop culture lovin', wise-crackin' ode to adolescent humor, but if you laughed your ass off with the first one, you'll get more of the same with this one. There is more than enough room to poke fun at the superhero genre that is so predominant in the theatres these days. Although paradoxically, this just adds to the unending proliferation of grown men running around in silly costumes on the silver screen.\n\nAnd I wouldn't have it any other way. \nI know.\nI need help.",

This movie is branded as a \"family movie\" and in a weird sort of way this movie accomplishes just that while teaching lessons of family and friendship. This movie is enjoyable all around from the slapstick, crude humor, to the action, and even down to some deeper meanings present within the film.",

            "content": "Deadpool 2 is a return of the things many loved about the first movie.  There are nods and easter eggs as well as references to those who enjoyed the X-Force comics.  The characters were well cast.  Josh Brolin is a good Cable and a great fit for Deadpool.  Cable is a mirror image of Deadpool, and gives Wade a chance to look at himself from the outside in.  Domino is a fun character and the actress was a great choice for the role.  My only knit pick is that she is black with a white dot instead of white with a black dot, like, a domino.  I am a fan of the comics and have grown to enjoy Domino for years.  I think it would be cool if they added another Domino who was like the comics and see how the interaction between the characters would play out.  Perhaps something like an echo of Cable and Deadpool or alternative timelines colliding. (Comics meets movie versions of all the characters.)  I enjoyed that the movie brought back many characters from the first movie who start off the opposite of Deadpool, but the movie address the subjectivity of 'good' vs 'evil'.  I think that the characters developed a lot in the movie and by the end I feel that the pieces fit nicely and it felt complete.  \n\nOne negative the movie did have was some deaths that I really wish weren't there.  I think that the acquisition from Disney will bury the story of the X-Force for a possible side reboot of sorts, which I think Deadpool being immune to would be interesting.  The comics deal a lot with different realities and timelines, and I think that would make things very interesting.  I hope to see more of these films and the creative talents behind these movies are given the room they need to create more films!",

That night, after the pair decide to start a family together, the target tracks Wilson down and inadvertently kills Vanessa. Wilson kills the man in revenge, and blaming himself for her death attempts to commit suicide six weeks later by blowing himself up. Wilson has a vision of Vanessa in the afterlife, but the pieces of his body remain alive and are put back together by Colossus. Wilson is left with only a Skee-Ball token, an anniversary gift, as a final memento of Vanessa. Recovering at the X-Mansion, Wilson reluctantly agrees to join the X-Men because he believes Vanessa would have wanted him to. He, Colossus, and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) respond to a standoff between authorities and the unstable young mutant Russell Collins / Firefist at an orphanage, labeled a \"Mutant Reeducation Center\". Wilson realizes that Collins has been abused by the orphanage staff, and kills one of the staff members. Colossus stops him from killing anyone else, and both Wilson and Collins are arrested. Restrained with collars that suppress their powers, they are taken to the Ice Box, an isolated prison for mutant criminals. Meanwhile, Cable (Josh Brolin) a cybernetic soldier from the future whose family is murdered by an older Collins\u2014travels back in time to kill Collins before he ever becomes a killer...\n\nRotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads, \"Though it threatens to buckle under the weight of its meta gags, Deadpool 2 is a gory, gleeful lampoon of the superhero genre buoyed by Ryan Reynolds' undeniable charm. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, jokingly calling it the best sequel since The Godfather Part II and saying: \"Deadpool 2 is wicked, dark fun from start to finish, with some twisted and very funny special effects, cool production elements [and] terrific ensemble work.\" PopMatters writer J.R. Kinnard wrote: \"If you enjoyed the guilty pleasures of Deadpool, it's an immutable law of physics that you will love Deadpool 2. The second verse may be the same as the first, but that verse is a dirty limerick of childish goodness.\" Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film 3 out of 4 stars and wrote, \"Deadpool 2 is just like Deadpool only more so. It's actually a fair bit better\u2014funnier, more inventive than the 2016 smash...and more consistent in its chosen tone and style: ultraviolent screwball comedy.\" A.O. Scott of The New York Times was critical of the cynical tone of the film, writing \"something ever so slightly dishonest about this character, something false about the boundaries drawn around his sadism and his rage. Deadpool 2 dabbles in ugliness and transgression, but takes no real creative risks.\" New York writer David Edelstein wrote that the film was tedious and predictable, noting \"A superhero movie with the looseness of a Mad magazine parody remains a viable idea, as demonstrated by the underrated Mystery Men and, of course, Deadpool. But a film that spits one-liners as mechanically as a tennis-ball launcher is even more tediously predictable than one with no sense of humor at all.\"\n\nI must say I do love this second Deadpool movie, even more than the first one. It\u00b4s witty, under the belt funny, violent beyond borders and crazy with a great dialogue/script and a fantastic character gallery. Love Josh Brolin as Cable and Zazie Beetz as Domino (Wow!). And I do like T.J. Miller as Weasel. \"Deadpool 2\" is excellently filmed and edited and the CGI is great as well. Gotta give cred to Director David Leitch for putting together one hell of a cartoon comic film with a great mix of action and comedy. I am looking forward to the third installment of Deadpool!",

Let's start with the negative: the action wasn't as good as the first one, that was disappointing since Deadpool is known for over-the-top violence. There was action but nothing memorable. The best part of this movie was the humor, that exceeded the first one. In fact, some of it was pretty dang good and clever that it made up for some of the lack of action. I give this movie credit for one thing: there're some scenes that completely left me with my mouth open, it was actually very impressive. So, I wouldn't say that it was better or worse than the first one, it's pretty much as good as its predecessor.",

Deadpool is the most disappointing movie of 2018 I've seen so far.\n\nDeadpool 2 is so aggressively meta that I failed to even laugh once (except for one of the end credit scene). Not only are many of the jokes recycled from the first film, but many of the pop culture references were flat. The movie even explained some of the jokes just in case you didn't get it.\n\nThe movie is 2 hours long and I felt that it could've been shorter. The prison scene took up far too much screentime, and the \"death\" scene near the end went on for far too long. Sorry for \"spoiling\" the movie, but Deadpool 2 already did that at the beginning of the film.\n\nThe only scene I enjoyed in the film was the prison transport fight scene, but that's it. The movie was unfunny and tonally inconsistent, the supporting characters were forgettable and the movie has almost twice the budget of the previous film, but the production value doesn't look better. I'm sure fans of the first film (and people in general) will like this film. All I can say is the comedy didn't land for me.",

            "content": "Deadpool 2\n(2018)\n\nPlot:\nAmerican action thriller in which Ryan Reynolds reprises his role as alternative superhero Wade Wilson, AKA Deadpool. When a mysterious young boy with incredible powers captures the attention of the ruthless time-travelling mutant Cable (Josh Brolin), Deadpool must acquire a group of fellow rebels with incredible abilities to stop Cable in his path of destruction and save the boy.\n\nReview:\nAlthough I preferred the first movie, mainly because it was unique and quite shocking in parts, I did find this movie funny, even though I wanted Ryan Reynolds to shut up most of the time. The action scenes were pretty impressive and I liked Josh Brolin as Cable but I found Firefist a bit misplaced. Domino was also a great addition to the so-called X-Force but I would have liked to have seen more from Negasonic, who was great in the first movie. I think the main problem with this film is that we're not seeing anything new from Deadpool. We do get to see a bit of an emotional side after the dramatic beginning, and his relationship with Firefist shows that he has a heart, but from a superhero point of view, it's very much like the first movie. As usual, the jokes do go a bit far sometimes, but that's what makes Deadpool a unique character that is certainly different from the other superheroes on the market. The movie is set with Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) successfully working as a mercenary for two years, but when his girlfriend Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) is sadly murdered after they decide to start a family, Deadpool tries many ways to kill himself. Colossus saves him after another attempt on his own life, and he takes him to the X-Mansion to rehabilitate. During his rehabilitation, Colossus and Negasonic respond to a standoff between authorities and the unstable young mutant Firefist (Julian Dennison) at an orphanage labelled a \"Mutant Re-education Center\". Deadpool realises that Firefist has been abused by the orphanage staff, and kills one of them, even though he agreed with Colossus not to kill anyone. Soon after that, Firefist and Deadpool are arrested and restrained with collars, which makes them unable to use their powers. Meanwhile, Cable (Josh Brolin) - a cybernetic soldier from the future whose family is murdered by an older Firefist - travels back in time to kill him before he ever becomes a killer. Cable breaks into the prison and attempts to kill Firefist, but Deadpool's collar breaks and he defends Firefist, who is unaware of why Cable is trying to kill him. Firefist overhears Deadpool saying that he doesn't care for him, so he gives himself up to the guards. Deadpool puts together a team, called the X-Force, to break Firefist out of a prison-transfer convoy, and defend him from Cable. During there mission, most of his team die whilst landing from a parachute jump, except for Deadpool and Domino (Zazie Beetz). Whilst fighting against Cable, Firefist frees fellow inmate Juggernaut, who agrees to help him kill the abusive orphanage headmaster. Juggernaut destroys the convoy, allowing himself and Firefist to escape. Cable offers to work with Deadpool and Domino to stop Firefist's first murder and agrees to give Deadpool a chance to talk him down. After an epic battle between the newly formed X-Force, Firefist and Juggernaut, Deadpool fails to talk down Firefist, so Cable attempts to kill him. Deadpool ends up jumping in front of the bullet, and after Firefist sees his sacrifice to save him, he doesn't kill the headmaster, who is eventually run over by Deadpool's driver Dopinder (Karan Soni). With Firefist under control, Cable uses the last charge on his time-travelling device, which he needed for returning to his family, to go back several minutes to stop the bullet from killing Deadpool. It's hard to see where they can take this franchise because they cram so much into one movie. With the newly formed X-Force, and the introduction to some new superheroes, the possibilities are endless but Deadpool is the Marvel cash-cow that has got audiences begging for more. Personally, I think his non-stop banter, and crazy one-liners won't last forever, but now that he has access to the time-travelling device, Marvel has the chance to do something special with the 3rd movie. I just hope they don't mess it up! Anyway, this movie is definitely worth a watch, especially if you were a fan of the first movie, but I would like to see him face a worthy opponent, who he would have to take seriously. Watchable!\n\nRound-Up:\nThis movie was directed by David Leitch, who also brought you John Wick and Atomic Blonde. He's due to remake Enter the Dragon, which should be left alone, and the Division starring Jessica Chastain and Jake Gyllenhaal. He's also filming a Fast & Furious spin-off called Hobbs & Shaw, which is about Dwayne Johnson's character from the Fast & Furious, teaming up with Jason Statham. It also stars Idris Elba so it's definitely a blockbuster that should get a good reception. As for this movie, it's very well written and full of action from the beginning to the end. The references to different movies cracked me up, and when Deadpool went back in time to kill Hitler, I just couldn't stop laughing. It certainly went down well with the critics, and it made a hefty profit at the box office but it's currently 100th in the highest-grossing movie chart, with the original in 85th place with a $783million profit. Although it's primarily a comedy, there is a lot of gory scenes, which meant that it's not suitable for kids, so that might explain why the profit wasn't as big as a lot of the other Marvel movies. Anyway, I can't wait for a 3rd instalment, and I hope they involve some of the X-Men.\n\nBudget: $110million\nWorldwide Gross: $742million\n\nGenre: Action, Adventure, Comedy, Sci-Fi\nCast: Ryan Reynolds, Josh Brolin, Morena Baccarin, Julian Dennison, Zazie Beetz, T.J. Miller, Karan Soni, Eddie Marsan, Terry Crews, Brad Pitt, Paul Wu, Matt Damon, Bob Delaney and Leslie Uggams. 7/10\n\nPlease check out my Movie Review blog at leonblackwood.wordpress.com",

More importantly though, the team behind the Merc with The Mouth's second outing have obviously decided to fully embrace the outlandish craziness, ditch any semblance of seriousness, and go all-out this time around. The characters (Brolin's great), the action/fight sequences (David Leitch brings the Wick style), the locations - yes, everything is bigger, better, more interesting and more entertaining. Sure, there are a couple of things I didn't like much (particularly the decision to kill off a certain character), but for the most part, it's a pretty damn fun, action-packed, super violent, ultra-meta film where the balls to the wall approach really pays off.",

With the surprise enormous success of Deadpool in February 2016, most were concerned, myself included, that Deadpool might fall into that realm of \"trying to outdue it's predecessor\". Director David Leitch, of 'John Wick' fame does a great job of taking that fast paced, brutal action & injecting it into the Deadpool comedy realm, created by Rhett Rheese, Paul Wernick and Ryan Reynolds in the first movie. To me, the first was a Romantic Comedy with action thrown in here and there. This is more of an Action-Comedy and feels different. BUT a good different.\n\nNow, that's not to say that this movie doesn't have its flaws, and pardon this next part here for being a tad off the cuff. The thing about this movie that didn't put it into the upper echelon like the first Deadpool is the supporting cast. Brolin and Beetz are both PERFECTLY CAST as Cable and Domino but are completely underutilized in their roles and time on screen. Instead the focus and momentum is shifted to Julian Dennison, who plays teenage mutant Russell.\n\nRemember that old song\n\"Oneeee of these things is not like the other, not like the other .... \"\nYa. That's him.\nHe's the \"other\" in this movie. \nLoud, screaming all the time and completely unfunny and at times brought me out.\n\nOverall though, one bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch , and with Reynolds, Brolin & Beetz expected to come back for part 3, we will get more banter and mayhem with the aptly named 'X-Force'. Does it have the same savage sense of humor = \u00e2\".\nDoes it up the ante on the action = \u00e2\"\u00e2\".\nDoes it entertain = \u00e2\"\u00e2\"\u00e2\".\nGrade : B +",

The jokes land and the X-force scene was one of the funniest scenes in both of the Deadpool movies and is my favorite.  The addition of cable played by Josh Brolin AKA Thanos put more emotional investment into this movie making him a good Character who also grows through the movie going from a man wanting revenge for the death of his family to doing the right thing even if he don't want to.

Between all the bad ethics, it's actually forcing on you some \"important\" messages too - that's a bit much for a film like this.\n\nSo, not bad for a follow up, not bad for entertainment, but it does not leave you with much.

Was the script and story anything to write home about? Of course not! Was there a lot of gratuitous violence? Hell yes! But then, this was pretty much what could be expected. Anyone offended or surprised by this should not really have picked this movie in the first place.\n\nDespite the fairly juvenile jokes, the sometime illogical script and the way over the top chop-chop-and-chop-some-more violence I had great fun watching this movie. I really enjoyed the action sequences a'la Kill Bill, the special effects and yes, the jokes. Most of the time at least)\n\nEverything was so silly and over the top that it actually became funny. Each scene, taken by itself, would probably have been considered silly, or even bad, by me but stringed together in the context of the movie as a whole it just worked. For me at least.\n\nThe action sequences, CGI and everything that should be in a superhero movie was, in my mind, quite good. Also, despite not really being anything to write home about the story was quite adequate. Simple, straightforward and a lot better than the crap that a lot of the stuff that social and political correctness preaching writers at Marvel are spewing out these days.\n\nI definitely liked Cable as the hard hitting ass-kicking cyborg. When Domino was first introduced I was not impressed, even though she's hot. I mean, luck as a superpower? However, when she started to pull all these hilarious stunts with these incredibly unbelievable chains of events I quickly changed my mind. Oh, and I did like Deadpool of course. That goes without saying. If you do not like the main protagonist it is difficult to like the movie itself is it not?\n\nMost of the other characters were between okay and so so. The one character I never really liked was Firefist. He was never funny, just incredibly stupid and childish.\n\nThe team of fellow mutant \"warriors\" that Deadpool pulled together? Well let's say that I am not that disappointed that they were somewhat \"expendable\" but it looks like that was the whole point of it. When the first of them whammed into that bus I thought \"What the f...?\" and then it just continued with one gory event following another. Nice touch with the blue blood by the way. I guess the guy was an alien after all.\n\nTo sum it up, a lot of the movie was pretty much what I expected but altogether I think I was positively surprised. Two hours of great fun actually.",

On top of it, all this gender gibberish and the gay stuff got more and more annoying, the longer I watched the movie.

It's a fun time, light-heartedly profane in the same vein as the original, if not half as unconventionally creative. With the enlarged budget and heightened expectations, not to mention the change in director, far more of the laughs feel forced and manufactured. If the first spent 90% of its time in the character's wheelhouse, the sequel goes for something closer to 25%, and a majority of that is in the second act. Ryan Reynolds remains a picture-perfect casting choice, I loved his contrast with Josh Brolin as Cable, Zazie Beetz is a spunky, welcome addition as Domino, but the plot structure feels too tame and the jokes more restrained. Rather than doubling down, we've lightened up and settled for a handful of throwbacks to what worked last time.

This is especially true with the new characters (ahem, Domino) and the X-Force. As usual, nobody else can ever play Deadpool the way Ryan Reynolds does. Also, they really stepped it up with the references, poking fun at DC and Wolverine at every turn. Long story short, I just loved it.

The acting was amazing as Ryan Reynolds does a great job to make Deadpool seem as if he is an actual person and Zazie  Beetz does a very good job playing Domino. There was good character development with Cable and the movie ends with his character being more likeable and Domino a new favourite to many people. They plot line was good and had very funny moments in it. The movie is a one of a kind that it seems only Deadpool is able to achieve from all of the fourth wall breaks to the funny suited soundtrack.",

I really enjoyed it, as I did the first film, but there was a sense here that the filmmakers may have bitten off more than they can lampoon. The meta jokes are still present, and as gleefully profane and hilarious as ever, but there were definitely more laughs to be had in the original. Bad language is often employed as a substitute for wit, and the controversial inclusion of Vanessa, Deadpool's love interest, doesn't add much to the story, and she pops up so rarely and with so little plot impact that her part could have been cut out, and it would have left more space to develop the other characters. I enjoyed how much more of Deadpool's serious, heartfelt side we see, and the formation of X Force has the potential for plenty of laughs down the road. While this film didn't reach the high watermark set by its predecessor, it's was still a tonne of fun, packed with sharp jokes, biting satire and Ryan Reynolds bringing us the character he was born to play.",

I was pretty critical of the first \"Deadpool\" because it seemed to focus more on R-rated humor and what gags could be permitted under that banner instead of crafting a good story for Wade Wilson to take part in, but that is NOT the case this time around. The humorous stuff comes from the situations Deadpool finds himself in, rather than it ALWAYS being the joke factory pouring from his mouth, and that makes all the difference (plus, it allows him to evolve as a character). Coming in this year-of-all-years in the superhero \"Golden Age Decade\" for silver-screen adaptations (with huge, \"world-ending events), I especially appreciated the relative \"small-potatoes\" stakes of this story compared to the other big superhero movies that have been released. The flick had a very high \"hit-to-miss\" ratio on the successful gags in there, and I was hilariously shocked to see some of the things they got away with (as far as jokes not only ragging on the Marvel Universe, but also across the aisle at DC and even movies you would not expect to be referenced in a soft-\"R,\" potty-mouthed, blood-soaked superhero movie). The movie also benefits (from a visual and action standpoint) from the upgrade to \"John Wick\" director David Leitch (after Tim Miller left the project). A few minor niggles, along with some dodgy CGI in places, keep the film from complete greatness, though, even if they don't mess it up too badly. First, I really do not feel a major act in the first portion of the film had to occur to give Wade the proper motivation to travel on the journey he goes on in the flick; I think it could have been done in a way that the sequence I speak of did not need to incite Deadpool's growth. The other thing is how shortchanged the supporting cast gets in terms of screen time and development. Even if I already have a working background knowledge of these folks as a comics fan, as a movie-lover I wanted to see much more from Zazie Beets' Domino and Josh Brolin as Cable; however, they are not afforded enough time and care to offer more than the basics and one-dimensional personas, info on where they come from and what drives them, and the like. Still, this film serves as a very entertaining romp, and even matches up to \"Infinity War\" on poignant moments. They went too far on the sexy/gutsy-gore stuff and forgot about a story in the first one, but they got the formula right this time. I cannot wait for a third (unless Disney cancels it with the Fox merger), and viewers should avoid missing out on this one.",

            "content": "Unlike many, I wasn't the biggest fan of 2016's Deadpool. The ultra-violent, tightly focused screenplay was refreshing and frequently benefitted from its hard-R rating, but many of its low-effort sophomoric jokes fell flat, personally. The resulting dialogue didn't seem to flow well and only occasionally squeezed genuine emotion out of me. Still, it was an enjoyable enough film, and I was taken aback by the amount of care and development given to this strange parodic remnant from the 90's. Deadpool 2 is a solid continuation that offers more of the same, with some refinement along the way.\nUnder copious amounts of blood and vulgarity, Deadpool was a romantic comedy disguised as a superhero movie. With a focus on family, Deadpool 2 is a logical continuation of Wade Wilson's (Ryan Reynolds) surprisingly tender character arc as he struggles to save a young mutant from a time-traveling cybernetic assassin, Cable (Josh Brolin), while reconciling his differences with the heroes at Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters.\nThe intimate moments between Wilson and his girlfriend, Vanessa (Morena Baccarin), were easily the highlights of the first film, and Deadpool 2 offers more complexity to its hero through a tragic first half. Reynolds once again lends the otherwise farcical character some serious depth that sucked me in emotionally and kept me invested through to the end. Seeing Wilson grieve and feel real, genuine emotion yielded far and away the high points of the film. Though it doesn't make much sense for a film that's at heart a raunchy comedy made for teens, I would have loved for these excellent dramatic points to take more focus.\nWhat Deadpool 2 does offer in spades is a never-ending onslaught of quips, self-referential humor, and pop-culture references. Though it can get tiring, the humor feels more effortful this time around thanks to a greater variety of jokes that focus more on situational comedy (there's a great gag involving regenerating limbs that almost had me in tears) than lowest-common-denominator wisecracks. The dialogue feels less forced as a result, making for a smoother, more seamless viewing experience. The return of Leslie Uggams and Karan Soni as Blind Al and Dopinder the taxi driver, two standouts from the last film, were also very welcome.\nAlongside its heart and funnies, Deadpool 2 also mingles in some satisfying action. There's more to the R-rated gore as the film takes great advantage of Deadpool's acrobatic fighting style and accelerated healing factor in some really neat ways. The addition of the charming newcomer Domino (Zazie Beetz), a mutant whose superpower is good luck, ensured there was always something interesting going on.\nOn that note, fans looking forward to the promise of X-Force from the film's marketing may leave the theater disappointed. I found the use of the team clever in the context of the film's larger theme, though, and was glad it didn't intrude on the small-scale personal ventures of its characters.\nDeadpool 2 only ever excels during its short stints into dramatic territory. For what it's worth, though, the film is a solid comedy with a violent edge that's sure to please many looking for a couple of hours of cheap laughs.",

            "content": "I think a lot of people, myself included, were surprised by how massively successful the original Deadpool was.  As it stands right now, the original Deadpool is the most commercially successful R-rated movie of all time at a gross of $783 million on a $58 million budget.  That's pretty impressive when you think about it, at the time, it was probably the first (major) R-rated superhero movie since the Blade trilogy finished off with Blade Trinity in late 2004.  Ironically, Ryan Reynolds also appeared in this movie.  Having said that, superhero movies weren't as prevalent then as they are now and the Blade Trinity had more limited potential.  At the same time, having had a couple of years to reflect back on the success of the original movie, I can't believe that I was surprised at its success.  First of all, it was a gleefully violent and profane superhero movie that broke the fourth wall constantly in an era when, really, most MCU movies, really, just blended into one another.  That's not saying they were bad, in fact, just the opposite, a lot of them are very good and some of them even excellent.  It's just that stylistically and tonally, those films are completely homogenized to fit within Disney's family-friendly image.  So Deadpool came along at exactly the right place at exactly the right time.  And it's not just that the movie embraced its violence and profanity with pure glee, because that on its own would not be enough, it's the fact that it was a supremely well-written movie.  It really was one of the funniest movies I saw that year.  And people gravitated to that in a world where superheroes are always fighting against the end of the world, it was just fun to watch a smaller, self-contained story that, really, broke all the established rules for what that genre could be.  And its success made it possible for Logan to get more creative leeway in telling its story the way it wanted to and, for all intents and purposes, Logan is revered as one of the best movies in the genre.  It's also making it possible for this New Mutants movie (also from 20th Century Fox) to become a thing.  Essentially the New Mutants is a superhero horror movie set in the X-Men universe.  And, for all you can say about 20th Century Fox, I gotta give them major props for allowing their superhero properties to explore different styles of telling a story than than what is normally accepted for superheroes.  Having said that, the original Deadpool was like catching lightning in a bottle.  I'd be lying if I told you I wasn't a little nervous that this would be disappointing compared to the original movie.  It's obviously not gonna be as fresh as the original, so that newness is gone.  Will they repeat the same jokes?  Will the script be lacking?  Will the story be a jumbled mess?  All of these and many more went across my mind.  Sophmore slumps and all that, it happens.  Iron Man 2 and Age of Ultron weren't as good as the previous installment.  But, wouldn't you know it, Deadpool 2 is equally as great, if not better than the original.  Part of me, as I was watching this movie, was wondering what people were seeing when they were saying it was better.  Because, while certainly very entertaining, at that particular point at least, it wasn't better than the original.  And, honestly, I don't know what the turning point was, but I know that there was a point where I just was like 'ok, this is better than the original'.  Is it more or less gleefully profane and violent as the original?  That I can't determine, but all I know is that I had so much goddamn fun watching this movie and, honestly, I can't remember the last time I had this much fun watching a film.  I had a blast watching Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, but it took me a while to figure out it was meant to be comedic.  This one, on the other hand, is a blast from beginning to end.  One of the things that I like about this franchise, and there's really a whole bunch of them, is the fact that, at its core, there's still a strong character in Wade Wilson.  The original movie was, in its own way, a romance.  Really.  Wade Wilson loves nothing more in this world than Vanessa and the original movie told a really effective, if raunchier, romantic story around these characters.  So, again, the character isn't just about the breaking the fourth wall, killing and just being a dick.  Thanks to Vanessa, Wade feels like a real enough person in his own universe.  She gives him purpose and a reason to live.  And I feel that that surprising emotional depth continues in this movie.  This is gonna be spoiler-y, so just skip ahead.  Essentially, Vanessa is murdered at the beginning of the film and Wade goes through this mental breakdown as a result of her death.  They were about to start a family, or at least attempt to do so.  He literally blows himself up at the beginning of the film.  He, eventually, is put back together by Colossus and he takes him to the X-Mansion, where Colossus offers him a spot in the X-Men.  This leads to one hilarious gag where Deadpool, once again, complains about the studio not giving them enough budget to include more X-Men.  In the room next to where he's standing, however, there's a meeting with the X-Men.  Xavier, Beast, Storm, Quicksilver, Cyclops and Nightcrawler all appear, all played by their current actors.  Beast, however, slowly closes the door without Deadpool noticing.  It's a scene that's no longer than 10 seconds, but it's a really funny visual gag.  And the fact they got all the actors to come in for that was also pretty funny.  Anyway, essentially, Deadpool becomes a trainee and he helps attempt to dissolve this situation at a mutant rehab center where this orphan, who controls fire through his fists, is putting himself and others in danger.  Family is one of the biggest themes of this movie.  This kid, Wade assumes and the kid latter confirms it, has been abused by the orphanage staff.  Deadpool kills one of the staff members and him, along with the kid, are thrown in this ice box, which is a prison for mutants where, through this collar, their powers are negated.  Russell, the orphan, finding someone who helped him, gravitates to him due to his issues of abandonment.  Deadpool being Deadpool, he pushes him away and tells him to make friends with the biggest and meanest in the ice box.  Rusell does, in fact, do so and he becomes friends with Juggernaut, who helps him in his quest for revenge against the headmaster of the mutant rehab facility  While this is going on, Cable travels back in time in order to hunt down and kill Russell in order to prevent him from becoming this cold-blooded murderer in the future and save his wife and daughter, both of whom were murdered by an adult Russell in the future.  Cable seems to be some sort of a cyborg or something and, almost right from the start, you're waiting for Deadpool's eventual Terminator joke and, naturally, he doesn't disappoint.  Anyway, Cable is trying to hunt down this kid and kill him and Deadpool feels forced to create his own team to keep Cable from killing Russell (or Firefist, a quite literal name).  Anyway, he adds Domino, The Vanisher (which leads to some really cool moments and a hilarious cameo), Bedlam, Shatterstar, Zeitgeist and a regular man named Peter who thought the ad for the team looked fun.  I feel this is the turning point of the movie for me.  Like all the X-Force members (minus Domino), on this mission to stop this convoy that's moving all the ice box prisoners elsewhere in order to save Russell, end up dying after the jump out of a plane to make a cool and heroic entrance.  Bedlam is driven through this bus' windshield, Shatterstar is chopped up to bits by a helicopter's blades, Zeitgeist flies into a wood chipper and Peter is vomited on by Zeitgeist, who spits acidic...fluids and, of course, he dies.  Oh and The Vanisher electrocutes himself, which is when you see who the actor is.  This part of the movie is hilarious and it bleeds into a really fucking cool action sequence where Domino, whose superpower is luck...yes, really.  This is a running joke in that Deadpool makes fun of her because luck can't be a superpower and, honestly, it's actually really cool.  Just watching things around Domino collapse or move around in her favor was actually cool visually.  Anyway, the action sequence with the convoy is pretty damn great and exciting.  Being as spoiled as I am by movies like The Raid and the Mad Max franchise, it takes a top-notch action for me to really notice and, while ths doesn't reach those high levels, it's still pretty damn effective as an action movie.  The convoy ends up leading to a callback to the first movie, where Deadpool, after literally being ripped apart by Juggernaut, starts to grow baby legs.  Once again, this ends up being a really funny scene as everyone from Dopinder, the taxi driver from the original that now wants to be an assassin, Domino, Weasel, Blind Al and even Cable all poke fun at his baby legs.  Either that or they're disgusted.  Eventually, Cable teams up with Deadpool (and his team of...just Domino actually) in order to stop Russell and the Juggernaut, who are making their way to the mutant rehab center.  Before that, however, Deadpool apologizes to Colossus for his actions earlier in the film and enlists his help along with Negasonic and Yukio's (Yukio is Negasonic's girlfriend).  Deadpool's friendship with Yukio is another really funny running gag.  They're always saying hi and bye to each other.  It's such a polite friendship when Deadpool is anything BUT polite to ANYONE, like, ever.  If there's one thing that I like about the Deadpool series is that, realistically speaking, they're relatively small-scale.  It's not a 'save the day or everybody dies' type of situation.  I mean, really, Cable comes from the future in order to stop Russell from becoming this mass murderer, but he's not a threat like Thanos (which, of course, Deadpool makes a joke about) or something like that.  It's not super serious, though Wade's journey to save Russell from becoming a monster is really surprisingly effective in terms of Wade searching for redemption through Russell.  But, anyway, the climactic action sequence is also satisfying in how it's executed, edited together and the music they use to set the violence to.  Deadpool's death scene is typically Deadpool and, naturally, very funny.  Cable, being able to jump back in time once more in order to save Wade.  And, essentially, Cable becomes part of the team and, honestly, they're clearly 'X-Men rejects', but the combination of Cable, Deadpool, Domino, Colossus, Negasonic and Yukio make for a really cool team.  And, honestly, I look forward to their journeys in the future.  The mid-credits scene with Deadpool travelling back in time saving Vanessa, Peter from the original X-Force (instead of  travelling a little more backwards in time and saving the ENTIRE TEAM), shooting the original Deadpool from X-Men Origins: Wolverine to fix the timeline and, the best one of them all, shooting Ryan Reynolds himself before he films Green Lantern (they poke fun at Batman v Superman and the DC Universe as well) is tremendous.  So, yea, I loved this movie, every solitary second of it.  It obviously isn't as fresh as the original, which was just something completely different than what we were used to, but at the same time this is still, somehow, an improvement on the original Deadpool.  It contains more of the same violence, wit and irreverence as before but it's just better this time.  The casting is tremendous.  Ryan Reynolds is born to play Deadpool, like there's no one else who embodies Deadpool as much as that guy.  Deadpool is like a supremely exaggerated version of Reynold's own personality.  Josh Brolin is such a great addition to the franchise as Cable.  I can't fucking wait to see those two play off of each other in Deadpool 3 with Deadpool being, well, Deadpool and Cable being the straight man.  Zazie Beetz as Domino, again, is just such a great addition to the franchise and, once more, I can't wait to see what they do with this motley crew.  This was such an absolute blast from beginning to end.  The sad thing is that, eventually, the quality is gonna have to drop and I don't want it to because I enjoy these damn movies so much.  The fact that this is more of the same isn't a bad thing, because it improves on what came before and makes it even more entertaining.  So, yea, this was a pretty fucking great movie.  It's not gonna be for everybody, but I would easily recommend this if you're looking for something that, still, feels different than every other superhero movie out there.  Gleefully violent and profane, great characters, great performances, surprisingly strong emotional cores, hilarious, witty dialogue, I mean, you can't really go wrong with this if you're a fan of superhero movies.  Deadpool might not be the hero we need, but he's the hero we deserve.",

            "content": "I was not a fan of the first \"Deadpool\" movie nor am I fond of the Marvel character on which it's based, but damn you, Ryan Reynolds: you've made this sequel a slam dunk. I contend that only a true fan can successfully make a movie that pleases other diehards, and Reynolds and team reach new heights of violence, comedy, and general bedlam in \"Deadpool 2.\" It's that rare follow-up that is actually better than the original.\n\nAs is the case with most blockbuster films, it's best not to know anything about the plot before discovering the movie for yourself. You can confidently read this review as I will be as vague as possible in order to avoid all spoilers.\n\nThis is a comic book movie for the comic-literate crowd. At no point does the film dumb it down for mainstream audiences: for maximum enjoyment you'll need to have a more advanced working knowledge of the superhero world. If you are a hardcore enthusiast (and in particular an X-Men junkie), you're not only going to delight in the catalog of obscure references, but you're going to want to see this movie several times to catch every single one of the often hilarious Easter eggs. I left the theater still giddy from what proved to be a ride of nearly nonstop belly laughs.\n\nI didn't think it was possible but this sequel is funnier than the original. The rapid fire pop culture nods are back with a vengeance but instead of coming across as more aggravating than amusing, they serve an actual purpose (and even when they don't, they're still funny as hell). Lively verbal banter, slapstick sight gags, hilarious opening titles...in spite of myself, the very things that irritated me about the original movie worked for me here. Get ready for put-downs of superheroes (of the Marvel and DC variety) and comic references both classic and modern (going all the way back to the vintage books of the 1960s to an up-to-the-minute \"Avengers: Infinity War\" one-liner).\n\nThe considerable magic that happens is mostly due to Reynolds and his unique brand of sarcastic snark. It was a risk for the studio to release 2016's R-rated \"Deadpool\" with its super violent, foul-mouthed lead character, but the film was such a runaway hit that it forever changed the face of superhero movies. I think its success has also given its star a newfound confidence and a bolder swagger which fits the character like a glove. Reynolds looks and feels so terrifically comfortable onscreen and while he is clearly the film's true MVP, his supporting cast also brings their A game. Josh Brolin (Cable) proves he's a force to be reckoned with when it comes to rough and tumble outlaw characters and while Julian Dennison (Russell) isn't given nearly enough to do, he's a sheer delight whenever he appears onscreen. Don't blink, because there are also some surprise cameos that had me internally hooting with excitement.\n\nNot everything comes up roses, however. There are a few too many overlong fight scenes that become increasingly tiring as they drag on and on, and the visual effects are a little corny looking (at least the film's overkill bloody violence works in its favor). But even when the story begins to fall into clich\u00e9d comic book movie convention territory, Deadpool breaks the 4th wall to directly warn the audience that there's a \"big CGI fight coming up\" or to explain away plot holes with a winking \"god, that's lazy writing.\"\n\n\"Deadpool 2\" is smarter, funnier, and more violent than its predecessor and combines all the ingredients in a way that's sure to delight fans. You really have to appreciate this movie for what it is and if you go with an open mind, you will enjoy the ride.\n\nMake sure you stay put after the final scene: you'll be treated to what's easily one of the best mid-credit stingers ever.\n\nA SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW",

I was laughing through pretty much the whole movie, you know, besides the parts all throughout concerning his wanting for suicide. But, he always has a sarcastic or dirty or just plain funny comment abut pretty much everything, and they threw in just a little bit of gay to get the audiences dying of laughter and chuckles. But some parts were very underwhelming, like the whole X-Force thing. I was hoping for an actual, legitimate team(by Deadpool's standards of course), but not for all of them but one to die(not counting Deadpool due to his near inability to die). And, I may just be stupid, but, once the collar was put on him, his cancer started to affect him. But with his healing power, all of his cells would be perfectly healthy, so shouldn't he be just fine when the collar is off? Anyway, back to the rest of the story. In the end, Deadpool puts the collar on and sacrifices himself to save Russell, but the entire reason he put it on was so that he wouldn't kill the guy that tortured him, but kill him instead, but either way, he's a killer!!! Which completely ruins the mission of trying to get him to not kill people. Though I guess it makes somewhat sense, because the only way he'll be able to see Vanessa again is to die, which is a bit different from the comics(here's the info i was talking about in my Infinity War review). In the comics, Deadpool wanted to get with Death, just as Thanos did, and the only way for him to do so would be to die. And you know how regeneration and healing goes. He can't die! But, he was supposed to die at the age of 102(I think). Thanos got jealous by, I'm sure, the fact that Deadpool just had to sit and wait for his demise, while he had to kill half of the universe. So, Thanos gave Deadpool the \"curse\" of immortality, so he could wait for eternity and never die, thus, never getting with Death. But that was way off topic. Besides the things I have already said, the movie was definitely worth splitting my sides lol. Though I could go without the disturbing image of Colossus killing baby Hitler.",

It also stars Josh Brolin as Cable and Zazie Beetz as Domino.\n\nThe story here is more complex though not as smoothly told when you compare it to the original and a lot of jokes did not land for me.\n\nI think my biggest flaw with this film is that it seems as if they are taking the character of Wade Wilson serious but everything surrounding him is a big joke. That means that whenever Deadpool (in costume) is on screen cracking jokes, it feels like a completely different character.\n\nStill there is fun to be had. Both Zazie Beetz and Josh Brolin steal the show whenever they are on screen, so much so that we needed way more of them. And Ryan Reynolds proves once again that he was born the play Deadpool.\n\nThe action is well directed, although it relies to much on CGI, and it features the best end credit scene I have ever seen.\n\nSo despite the flaws I have with it I still recommend seeing it on the big screen preferably with a packed audience.",

I do have to agree that this is one of the best works of David, because it really accomplish its job, which is entertaining the audience.   \n\nThe story of this film is quite caching in the sense that it makes you want to know more about the protagonist, but at the same time it does neglects the world that surround the main character, and it doesn't do a good job of explaining some things to the audience that might clear some confusion that surrounds the movie. I do agree with other people when they say that the plot of this movie is not that original, but I personally don't care much about that as long as it is entertaining and funny to watch. \n\nOne of my favorite things about this movie, is the use of morbid humor that is used in tense scenes, I also love the well thought, not confusing, action scenes, which adds a lot to the movie. My conclusion is that is a great movie if you are looking for a funny movie to pass the time, but It's not so great if you are wanting to know the history of this anti-hero. You can always read the comic if you want to know more about him.",

Ryan Reynolds once again proves that he's basically born to play the titular mercenary & Josh Brolin puts one more successful villain role under his acting belt.\n\nThat is not to say that the film is perfect though. The surrounding story wasn't as well-structured or interesting as the first film's story. At times it felt all over the place & the dream sequences that appeared mid-film weren't any help. Sure, they could work inside the world of the comic book pages but the translation to film ended up being off-putting & distracting.\n\n\"Deadpool 2\" is definitely nowhere near as good as the original but it's still a fun & entertaining comedy film with some very good aspects which manages to maintain the essence of Deadpool.\n\n(Updated from 16/05/2018)",

The story gets interesting after an aimless and clumsy first half, but it ultimately falters by not taking a narrative opportunity to the next level. Tonally it's all over the place and that affects its pacing. Finally, it disappoints by making the mistake everyone was worried it might cause: excessive use of comedy. When the jokes are on-point, they are hilarious, but when they fall flat, they are REALLY terrible, unnecessarily long and repetitive.\"",

Or furthermore, since the post-credits scene in the first movie? I'll do you one more even-what if I told you the least interesting parts of Deadpool 2 in fact featured the same guy who was so charismatically devious three weeks ago in Avengers: infinity War? Well, for my money's worth-I'd much rather watch the Deadpool 2 that deals with the titular character wholly figuring out how to balance his sarcasm and wit with that of being a part of something bigger-whether that be with Morena Baccarin's Vanessa or his newly formed X-Force family-but for the movie to go on for long stretches pretending as if Josh Brolin's Cable is a traditional villain in the sense that this is as much his movie as it is Deadpool's and that it is he who we will come to see the merc with a mouth clash with in the unavoidable climactic third act is a disservice to the movie in general as Deadpool 2 is simply better than that. It's better than this because, for a lot of its running time, Deadpool 2 (which is really a missed opportunity in terms of a title, guys-Untitled Deadpool Sequel is where it was at) balances so well the kind of irreverent humor that is the character's trademark and upending the expectations and conventions of the super hero genre in ways that aren't as obvious as one might imagine or as easy as it could be for writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick (Zombieland) to default to, but rather Reese and Wernick as well as star Ryan Reynolds, who gets a writing credit on this follow-up, insinuate from the get-go that this isn't just going to give you what you want while upending those expectations, but rather that it's going to do this in a way you don't necessarily see coming. The writers as well as new franchise director David Leitch (John Wick, Atomic Blonde) stick to this main idea, this thesis if you will, throughout and layer in a genuine emotional pull so as to not hang their main character out to dry with little more than the same shtick we've come to expect. That said, there are plenty of laughs to be had here and viewers won't be longing for more of the old because this isn't completely more of the same, but rather there is a more intense satisfaction to be had from the bigger ambitions Reese, Wernick, and Reynolds have for the character this time around. Still, I'd be lying if I said those ambitions don't get away from them throughout the course of this neXt-level adventure.\n\nread the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com",

            "content": "Not horrible but not nearly as good as the first one.\n\nThe first DEADPOOL was not only hilarious and action-packed but also fairly shocking in how much they got away with.  A hard R, indeed.  It was wall-to-wall, pretty much from the very first second and of course through to after the credits.  It was a joy and a wonder and a blast from beginning to end.  Of course they had to make a sequel, and we don't mind because we get more of Deadpool/Ryan Reynolds and that whole world and hopefully a lot more of that magic.  Maybe we should have known there could be trouble ahead when they went with a dull predictable title instead of staying with UNTITLED DEADPOOL SEQUEL, which would have made it more fun from the get-go.  Unfortunately, the second one is at most more of the same as the first and at worst sometimes a bit of a slog.  If the first one could be considered ground-breaking, at least in the situations and language and humor that hadn't been seen like that in superhero movies, this one goes into those familiar slots then doesn't do anything more with it.  It fits in the grooves but it doesn't push like the first one did.  Too many of the jokes are forced, and paced like they're trying to hit marks.  It even takes a few minutes just to get going, which on its own isn't a crime but the first one seemed like it was in a hurry to get everything out so it started as soon as it could.  The first one seemed desperate to do everything they wanted to do, as if they might not get another chance to do this, and that if they threw in as much as they could maybe they could more, and that all of it could be taken away at any minute so they wanted to do what they could.  It was a scheme that worked and they made if not one of the best-ever superhero movies (beating even a lot of Marvel Studios' stuff), but one of the best movies of the year (at least enough to get nominated for a Golden Globe).  The pop-culture references were even funny back then, though now it's either that the new ones are predictable or old already (really, a joke about dub-step?) or that we're done with shows that rely on pop references instead of actual wit (yet they keep making THE BIG BANG THEORY).  The comics references are even a little painful, knowing that even a good is probably too deep for most of the audience, and they will never even come close to knowing or bothering to figure it out.  This one just plays it far too safe, that it knows its expectations, and it comes out far too dull than it should be.  You can only push boundaries so far, even when you already proved you could do it the first time.  Granted, it's still fun through most of it, and it's got enough story to keep it going, if not enough jokes and shock to fill it, but it's a real let-down after the majesty of the first one.\nOf course the new characters are fun.  I don't know how they could have gotten Cable any better.  He even gets feet, which he didn't often get in the comics.  That body-suit at the beginning was doofy, though, but clearly they minimized it how they could.  It's not a question of Domino being in it more, but rather that they could have made her actually part of the story.  Being a tack-on doesn't suit her but if this is just a set-up for X-Force (or whatever the next thing is), then the wait could be worth the pay-off.  And X-Force itself, after so much anxiety about those characters leading up to it: well played.\n\nReynolds does his work, just like he did before.  Not only is he in a mask for most of it -- audacious in itself by Hollywood standards -- but the parts where he doesn't he has some gross make-up, leaving as little as possible where it's just his own, handsome self.  And he did a lot of the promotion as Deadpool, which somehow is still funny.  But then it will be a disappointment to see him just as Reynolds and, even worse, in a crap movie that isn't a DEADPOOL, but oh well, he has to feed his family.  He gets points for going the extra mile.  Whatsername is a stunning presence on-screen.  For however little we get of her in this movie, it can only be too little.  It's just a shame that to get more of her we have to watch GOTHAM.",

            "content": "The murderous, irreverent, fourth wall-breaking Merc with a Mouth is back this week.  Let us all rejoice!  Isn't that how many of us felt after 2016's groundbreaking (re) debut of Deadpool?  We'll forget about the abomination we saw in X-Men Origins:  Wolverine.  A lot of people, including Ryan Reynolds, want to.  In fact, there's an amusing segment on that in the end credits of this film.  Why was the 2016 outing groundbreaking?  Only because it became the highest grossing R-rated movie in history.  Sequels in general usually have much to live up to.  Especially sequels to irrefutable smash hits.  Deadpool 2 has a lot riding on it.  Particularly, as it's the one saving grace of Fox's faltering X-Men franchise.\n\nWe find Wade Wilson/Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) up to his usual mercenary hijinks to start in a dizzying montage of murder and mayhem.  When tragedy strikes, Wade finds himself in a crippling depression that even returning X-Men allies Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead cannot break (although NTW couldn't care less).  The only thing that reaches Wade is an angry unstable young mutant, Russell Collins, who he meets on a mission reluctantly accompanying the X-Men.  What complicates matters is the sudden appearance of a tough-as-nails soldier from the future, Cable (Josh Brolin), who has a few bad intentions for the child.  With bridges to his X-Men allies burned, Wade must assemble a new team of misfits to stop the unstoppable future soldier.  But, is the child really worth the save when he only shows himself to be a huge potential menace? \n\nNow the question is does the sequel live up to its predecessor?  My answer to that is yes and no.  Deadpool was going to be a hard act to follow.  It does definitely fall short of the 2016 film.  But, it is better than some sequels in general, and many comedy sequels in particular.\n\nLet's start with what worked.  When you're talking Deadpool, you have to start with comedy.  While there's humor throughout, there are three standout segments for me.  There's a marvelously wacky tribute to James Bond openings in this film's opening credits scene.  The end credits scene of Wade righting prior wrongs is hysterical even though they're rehashed sentiments that have been expressed before.  And, by far, the best part of movie involves the consequences of the newly formed \"X-Force\" skydiving from an airplane.  That was inspired lunacy that almost made me hurt myself  laughing.\n\nMost of the supporting cast from the original film is back including Vanessa (Morena Baccarin), NTW (Brianna Hildebrand), and Weasel (T.J. Miller).  There are two new characters of note added to the mix, the previously mentioned Josh Brolin as Cable and Zazie Beets as the mutant mercenary, Domino.  Brolin has a couple of memorable physical altercations with Reynolds' Deadpool.  Beets is the standout as the \"lucky\" mutant mocked by DP and pretty much the only competent member of X-Force.\n\nBut, therein lies part of the issues I had with DP2.  While Brolin and Beets were more than adequate in their roles from an acting standpoint, neither really looked the part of their characters to me.  Yes, here's where my comic geek roots kick in.  Unlike with Brolin's Thanos in Infinity War, there was very little CGI to enhance Cable.  And while he had the demeanor and most of the aesthetic look of Cable, there's one thing Brolin can't escape.  While he got in great shape for the role, he's not an overly large guy.  Cable is huge.  As much as I wanted to, I just didn't quite buy him as this character.  It's exactly the way I've come to view Tom Hardy as Bane in The Dark Knight Rises.  Getting buff doesn't add inches to your height or make a smaller body frame into a hulk. \n\nAs for Beets, let me preface this by saying my thoughts on her appearance have nothing to do with race.  I'm not even sure if Marvel has ever revealed Domino's nationality.  The point is that no matter what that might be, she has a very unique look that could have been remedied by a makeup artist.  Honestly, I've seen better aesthetic renditions of Domino by cosplayers and actresses in fan made films.  And note I would be saying this whether Domino was played by an African-American, Caucasian, Asian, Indian, or whatever actress was hired for the part.  Do whatever you want with the hair, but, give me the chalk white skin with the black eye patch.  That's Domino.\n\nBut, those are relatively minor complaints.  My major one is that DP2 really did suffer from a common sequel weakness.  It tried too hard to be bigger and better.  The jokes, while still funny, didn't hit with the same impact.  I didn't think not having Tim Miller on board as the director for this one would matter as much as it did.  But, I felt DP2 was put together as more of a string of incidents for Ryan Reynolds to riff from more than it was an actual story.  The writing in the first film felt much tighter.  \n\nI complained in my review of the first DP that the first film had fairly vanilla main villains who were adequate, but, nothing to write home about.  Well, they were the gold standard compared to Russell Collins and his partner (who I'll get around to shortly).  The fact that Russell is a kid automatically gives him plot armor because you know Wade wasn't likely to gut or behead him no matter how evil and obnoxious he was.  I know the kid had reasons for why he was the way he was, but, it didn't make him any less annoying or more interesting.  I just wasn't feeling this kid at all.  His attempts to be \"gangsta\" were cringeworthy at best.\n\nLet's get to the sidekick.  For all you Juggernaut fans out there, the character makes his first appearance since X-Men:  The Last Stand.  That's the good news.  The bad?  You still don't have a version to be proud of.  Although, to be fair, DP2 does provide the true reason the character wears that large helmet.  But, as you would expect in this type of movie, Juggernaut is basically (and literally in his final battle sequence) the butt of a joke.  Plus the Juggernaut/Colossus battle has some shoddy CG at times.  Again, to be fair, this could have been intentional given DP's statement prior to the fight.\n\nFrom what I understand, Ryan Reynolds had major input in the writing of DP2.  If that's the case, that might have been a mistake.  Even though the film makes stabs at providing some dramatic heft, it was a little weird paired with the often sophomoric comedy.  And that's the other thing.  Many of the jokes in DP2 weren't much different than DP.  Oh, I was still amused, but, there was something that felt a little off and flat to me this time around.  Jokes didn't have the same kind of bite.  The narrative was a little bit all over the place.  Want proof?  Cable had a certain motivation for pursuing Russell throughout the film.  Once that issue is resolved and he is able to go back to his timeline to a future he helped to create, he suddenly decides not to?  What was the purpose of you being in the current timeline in the first place if you aren't going to go back?  That decision just turns out to be a convenient plot device for DP's shenanigans during the end credits scenes.\n\nI wanted to like DP2 more than I did.  I really tried to.  I twisted myself into all types of crazy contortions to try to see it differently.  But, the bottom line is, the magic just wasn't there for me this time around.  This is a pale comparison to the 2016 film which I will now call a classic .  It's not awful.  There is enough of the DP zaniness to say that it's not a total waste of time.  But, it's still disappointing.  Much like Horrible Bosses and Sinister, DP is cursed with a  watchable, but, mediocre sequel after crafting a tremendous opening act.  That's something at least.  Most follow-ups fall well short of even that.  I give DP2 a thumbs up, but, not resoundingly so.",

            "content": "It should come as no surprise that Deadpool, a shocking hit that came out of nowhere, got a sequel.  What is surprising, is how clever and successful it is.  Comedy sequels are usually terrible - the nadir of popular cinema and all that.  Deadpool 2 defies this trend and improves upon the original, making it either on par with or superior to its predecessor.  I've said before that Deadpool was always Ryan Reynold's gambit to lose.  Needless to say, he owns it and every other line he spouts is quotable, allowing for multiple intoxicated viewings with your friends.  Josh Brolin shows up as Cable and it works better than you'd think.  Cable is a bit maligned these days by comic book purists as a hangover from the 90's - an edgelord anti-hero that overstayed his welcome.  But then again, he was always so much damn fun.  He's a perfect foil to Deadpool and yes you can insert your Thanos joke here, as does the Merc with the Mouth.  (Seriously Brolin is in GODDAMN everything this year, and I'm okay with that!)  There are some other great newcomers, such as Julian Dennison as a new teenage mutant and the focus of the plot.  His interplay with Deadpool rides the line between absurd and tragically insightful.  Zazie Beetz won me over on her take as Domino.  Yes, she does play the sexy superhero, but her comedic timing comes off as more cute than ribald - another foil to foulmouthed Wade Wilson.  \n\nMorena Baccarin returns for a smaller role but leaves a mark.  Yes, that most dreaded and dated trope of \"Women in Refrigerators\" returns here.  But Deadpool 2 parodies, subverts, and then undoes it in dramatic fashion.  And you see, that's the trick about this movie.  Deadpool always seems to be in on the joke and makes sure you are too.  It never quite becomes the thing it parodies, unlike Kick-Ass 2.  David Leitch applies the same sure and brisk direction that he gave John Wick and Atomic Blonde.  It succeeds as an action movie almost as much as it does as a screwball comedy.  Odds are you've probably seen this, but in case you haven't, it's time to drop those drawers and get busy.  Whoa.  Did I just say that?",

The majority of the movies you all give bad ratings to, a lot of people i know happen to love them. I understand you all get paid to criticize, and mever think of what other poeple feel, (like the cast, crew, directors), before you open you computers, phones or tablets. My mother always told me , if you dont have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.I understand everyone has a job to do, but you can at least take into consideration how other people might feel.

It's tough to not like any of the characters in the film. Plus, a lot of Deadpool 2 is like watching Dan Forden appearing from the side of the screen to say \"Toasty!\" after a fierce upper cut in Mortal Kombat?-?though as an actual system propelling all aspects of a full-length feature film.\n\nFirefist is right. I've never seen a plus-size super hero. Weasel is really funny. Domino, ha! Shout out to X-factor, and their serious replacements? Deadpool 2 is a funny film that slaps away serious topics by embracing and making light of them. After watching Deadpool 2, I feel like I'm done watching a draft of the potential angles for a film more than feeling like I've come away from a complete project (which?-?I guess, is the point of Deadpool 2?). Honestly, my mental reaction after watching Deadpool 2 is like Mary Elizabeth Winstead's reaction at the end of the Swiss Army Man.\n\n-K.D.\n\nOverall: 6.312/10\n\nP.S. Yeah, I know. Everyone's a critic. Conversation is good. I'm not holding anything against Ryan Reynolds either. It's just?-?walking to my car, all that comes to mind is Mr. D from School of Life when I think of Ryan Reynolds?-?and then Blake Lively. The Age of Adaline. Okay, we're done here.

It won't exactly be free because I drove my incredibly cool (and old) truck to get here, and gas isn't free.  And that toll booth charges me seventy-five cents each time I go through it.  And my truck doesn't keep itself full of oil (it leaks a lot) and anti-freeze (it also leaks).  Someone has to refill the reservoirs every few days.  Me.  Good old birthday coming soon me.\n\nBut the movie was free, sorta.  I signed up for Movie Pass, and it costs me $9.95 per month.  But I can watch as many movies as I want with this pass.  At any theater that accepts it (which is most, probably).  I just swipe my card and they give me a ticket.  The ticket even says that they charged my credit card (it looks just like one, with my name on it and all) $8.15.  Cool.\n\nI arrived early and I was hungry, so I ordered some Deluxe Nachos.  Medium.  And water.  I wanted a beer, but it was the afternoon and I didn't want to start drinking this early, or deal with the effects, or consequences, etc.  \n\nJonathan brought me my food and it was delicious.  I hate olives, so I asked him to leave them off.  But the jalapeno peppers were amazing.  And lettuce.  And tomatoes.  And cheese.  D.  Lish.  Us.\n\nJust as the previews started rolling, I was done with my lunch.  There was still food on the plate, but my tummy was no longer talking to me, and my taste buds had enough sensory opportunities.  I felt okay about leaving some of the food behind.  The Cinema Caf\u00e9 made $11.47 during my visit, so I don't feel bad about watching a movie for free.\n\nI sat in the fifth row (out of five or six), next to the wall.  About two-thirds of the seats in this auditorium were empty, including the two to my right.  I never looked at the girl who sat three seats over, but I heard her laughing.  A lot.  And once she said to her date, \"I don't know why you're not laughing.\"  I was laughing, but I wasn't her date.  I wouldn't have minded, but, er, no such luck.  Still, I wondered why he wasn't laughing aloud.  Moron.\n\nRyan Reynolds is hilarious as the superhero Deadpool, or supervillain, or X-men (in training).  He makes jokes about himself, about other people, and about the viewers who are watching the film.  By the way, he was also one of its writers, so the humor comes naturally to him.  For example, he mocks the movie \"Green Lantern,\" joking that it shouldn't have been created, even though it was he who starred in it.  Funny!  He talks about the Oscar watchers as he says weird stuff related to other movies, slowly dying, fading away...and then not dying yet.  Funny stuff, mocking his and other dying scenes, joking on himself and his need to be recognized for his acting artistry.  Humor outside of the storyline.  Ha!\n\nZazie Beetz as Domino is very cute.  And she is so darn lucky.  That's her mutant power.  Luck.  Probably a dozen times, when she is sure to have something bad happen, it doesn't.  Instead, something completely unpredictable happens to allow her to escape sure destruction, and death.  And she's cute.\n\nAnd then there is Juggernaut.  Big.  Powerful.  Easily swayed to do the bidding of a kid who gives him extra food.  Remember the part of the movie where Deadpool tells the kid to find one person and make him your friend.  Well, the kid does that, and wahlah, the storyline works...if you suspend reality and pretend that all this mutant stuff is real, and forget about asking how they got back to the orphanage to wreak havoc and vengeance on the abusers who worked there.  Just pretend.\n\nNow, a few critical comments here.  Lotsa cursing.  If you don't like the F-bomb, then tough, though it's funny when Deadpool gets Colossus to say it at the end.  Lotsa weird pedophile jokes and insinuations, and stereotypes of males who work with boys, and anal sex (reflect on Juggernaut's ending, literally his end, the shocking butt-scene), and penis jokes (think of what you first thought when the old blind lady was asked to rub his sore legs and she got disgusted.  Yep, adult humor, and very inappropriate for kids, but okay (apparently) for adults when coming from the mouth of a mutant like Deadpool.  \n\nWatch the movie.  And don't leave when the credits start.  Of course.  You know that.  There is always more in a Marvel movie.  Extra stuff.  And hints at another movie, and its main character.  Yay!\n\nLook.  Deadpool 2 is hilarious, and rude, insensitive, disgusting and ahhhhhh!  But, I laughed a lot, and I bet that you will too.  Maybe.  If you're weird and like the crazy antics that made the first movie, Deadpool, require a sequel.  Oh, a sequel?  Will there be a third in this franchise?  Maybe.  Hey, did you know that the makers of this movie, 21st Century Fox, is now owned by Disney?  Yep!  Disney, of you know, princesses and cute animation and happy endings (not like you saw in the preview of the comedy Muppet-like movie office scene, OMG, disgusting and funny).  So, is there a market for a third, or will the Deadpool character find himself in other Marvel movies, in a supporting role, or just there for the giggles?  I wonder.  Will X-Force re-emerge, with Domino (very cute), and Cable (very strong), and Deadpool (very funny)?  And that stupid weasel of a cab-driver?  Time will tell (that's a joke, by me, because now Deadpool has a timetravel device that Negasonic Teenage Warhead, the first openly LGBTQ marvel character depicted in a film, fixed for him.\n\nQuestion:  Is there any irony to the scene where Juggernaut became dead in a pool?  Deadpool?",

I don't think he's particularly funny and most of the fourth wall breaking is just an excuse to make more not very funny jokes.  That makes it sound like I didn't like the movie, but I actually did.  I just don't really like Reynolds or the character he's playing.  He is surrounded by actors and characters I did like though, and the action sequences are executed well.

Ryan Reynolds still absolutely owns this role and is so insanely likable and funny you just want to punch him.  The plot is basically Terminator 2, but it works fine, though if they go into a third movie we'll probably need more.  For now though, it's good.  Cable is a great addition, and he's handled perfectly.  They play him completely straight without a touch of satire, so you have this dark gritty character playing off of this damn clown and it totally works.  Also, can we take a moment to just appreciate how much of a godamn champion Josh Brolin is?  Damn that man's talented.  Bottom line, Deadpool 2 is fun, just a ton of fun.  It's got some great action, and awesome characters you love spending time with.  It doesn't wow like the first one did, but it works.",

            "content": "\"I'm Batman\"\n\n'Deadpool 2' is a massive improvement over the first in terms of film making and having more freedom to go balls to the wall. Not feeling so contained. Having more laughs and soul in this serious drama about the 'F' word. Well that's what Deadpool thinks. A lot more ruthless when referencing other movies or other source materials surrounding this movie.\n\nNow my main issue from the first movie is how colorless and bland the film making was. Something lacking or anything stuck out as memorable in terms of visual comedy. This time it's directed by David Leitch, best known for John Wick and Atomic Blonde, who added a lot of his mystical tricks into this. How Leitch filmed the action scenes was slick and flowed smoothly. Especially in the musical numbers (played for comedy) that plays along during those sequences as a parody for blockbusters trying to be serious. Also not forgetting the truck chase.\n\nRyan Reynolds returns as the mouth taking anti-hero, but more crude and plenty of fourth wall breaking to go around. It's clear from interviews and the behind the scenes that Reynolds is having an absolute blast playing this role. Probably the most fun he's ever had. Taking past failures into account for humor and doesn't waste time to erase them. Reynolds once again captures the character in spirit through his sharp line delivery and comedic timing. But also giving the character heart by showing a softer side, which stops him from being annoying.\n\nJosh Brolin is having such a great year it's unbelievable. First 'Infinity War', than this, and Sicario 2. I've never seen an actor who's been in three movies within three months back to back. His physical work and keeping up the straight man phase throughout also adds to the comedy. Never cracking a smile and keeping up the 'tough guy' appearance. He commands the scene whenever he appears on screen. Brolin delivers a great performance, what's new?\n\nWhile the achievements deserves it's praise, but please keep in mind it's not perfect by any mean, like a masterpiece level. It's freaking stupid if you ask me. Some of the CGI looked a bit noticeable and since there's a lot of jokes, not all land. While all the actors played the parts well, small or big, were excellent either way and have such great chemistry with each other. Unfortunately the same couldn't be said about T.J Miller who was one of the worst parts of the movie. The running gag of \"You look like an avocado had sex-\" or \"you look like Freddy Krueger face-fucked a topographical map\" was never funny in the first place. Glad he's screen time was short. I really hope they kill his character off in the next one, which seems more possibly if you heard the recent news surrounding the actor. Or knowledge his absence.\n\nOther than that, Deadpool 2 is an extremely enjoyable film that succeeds and falls short in certain areas. If you like the first, then you will or probably have enjoyed this. For me, I was laughing and smiling for 2 hours.\n\nOverall rating: Zazie Beetz and Rob Delaney are national treasures.",

(Give me a Domino movie!!) I love how this is a franchise that pokes fun at itself and others in its genre.

            "content": "Honestly I don't know waht kind of star to give it. I kind of wished I waited until it came onto video. So, first one was okay. Saw it with my moms and sister and they seemed to like it. I just thought it was okay. This one I almost didn't watch but had a couple of hours to waste so went to see it. It was more of the same. Less funny moments than the original for me, but there were some cute moments and lol moments. Didn't like how it began (a sort of flashback, but wasn't necessary). One review said they kept waiting for the movie to actually start (which is what I felt). All actors were good. Having the Maori kid in the movie was great. but he was the same character from \"Hunt for the Wilderpeople\". Which isn't necessarily a bad thing but felt like treading old ground. Domino was fun and would like to see more of her. A lot of in-jokes for the nerds. Cheapshot jokes too. There wasn't a proper Stan Lee cameo so that was a bummer. Also, not an aftercredit sequence just a midcredit one (which was actually fun and entertaining). I still want to see Fabian Nicieza, Rob Liefeld and Stan Lee in a deadpool cameo commenting on him being a moron and stan lee says, Don't look at me, I didn't create this guy. If you like the original, you'll probably like this one. So watch it if you like it, avoid it if you don't. If you're on the defense, wait for it to come on TV. Now for spoiler stuff: I think my main problem is that it opens with a major tragedy, which lessened the impact of the jokes, because he's supposed to be all depressed and shit, yet he still acts corny. The death of a major character took away the heart of the story for me. I liked the actress and I liked her character. Considering the fact that Marvel is terrible with its female characters, she was one I actually liked. So, killing her took it away. As a matter of fact, I thought she was going to become Mrs. Deadpool. But the other femaile characters are still nice and Domino was a welcomed new face. Cable took too long to show up. I thought it was going to be quicker. It also had a good diversity of cast. TJ Miller wasn't that funny. Some of the jokes were retreats and some of the plotlines were not that great. The scene where Deadpool dies at the end was too much, because, all they had to do was take off the collar, instead of having Cable waste his time travel for something that they can easily fix. MONDAY MORNING FILMMAKER: The movie went into a different direction than I thought. Since there was time traveling I thought they were going to go back and save vanessa (which they kind of did but as a throwaway gag). I thought the storyline should have been vanessa and deadpool have a kid and he is a superbaby, but similar plotline with the Maori kid and Cable comes back to kill Deadpool's kid. Hilarity ensues. The time when deadpool dies, I thought that Cable was going to learn when Vanessa died, set his watch to go back to that time period and Cable save Vanessa from dying. Deadpool gets another chance to go to Fire Fist, and this time helps him and not turn him into a bad guy. There needed to be an aftercredit sequence. It should be Deadpool meeting Hugh Jackman, trying to make a deal with getting him in the movie as Wolverine, finally Deadpool tells him, \"and it's going to be a musical\". Hugh Jackman is now interested. Or something like that",

Ryan Raynolds (Wade Wilson/Deadpool) shines again as the foul-mouthed mercenary. It's clear he was dying to bring the right Deadpool to the big screen, as he is perfect for the role again. His banter with his co-stars is great and some of the jokes thrown out, like calling Cable (Josh Brolin) \"Thanos,\" are excellent. The supporting cast is just as good, with Terry Crews (Bedlam), Bill Skarsbard (Zeitgeist), and Rob Delany (Peter) being fantastic in small roles. The real show stealer was Zazie Beetz (Domino). She's a star on Atlanta, but hopefully this got way more eyes on her. She was often the best part of the movie and her sibling like chemistry with Reynolds was top notch. Those two, along with Brolin, shined. The action was great, the soundtrack worked, and we also got an awesome surprise cameo, as well as a fun appearance from the Juggernaut.\n\nWeaknesses: Some of the more emotional aspects of the movie didn't click. Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) has something very emotional happen to her early on. However, when the film goes back to her for certain things later on, it kind of misses the mark and drags the film down. With so many new people involved, a few of the original cast members were shoved aside. Along with Baccarin, TJ Miller (Weasel), Brianna Hildebrand (Negasonic Teenage Warhead) and Stefan Kapicic (Colossus) all felt rather underutilized. \n\nOverall: A great sequel that is probably better than the original. Domino is a scene stealer and if they do a third installment, she needs to be a huge factor. The jokes mostly hit, the story was solid, and they made great use of most of the characters involved. A winner.",

Lot of fourth wall breaking, and even a great score from Tyler Bates. It's everything you could ever want from a Deadpool movie! Where this movie sort of loses me, and it's a nitpick, is when it becomes sad, yes a Deadpool movie has some depressing moments, and it's understandable, but I didn't really come to a Deadpool movie to see dark imagery and sad scenes, I came to have complete fun. However that is a nitpick for this movie is still great, Cable is a standout played beautifully by Josh Brolin; yet he is very underused and not used to his full potential. If you worried about the trailers showing you an Avengers like team up with Deadpool leading them, you have nothing to be concerned about since its nothing like that, it's still a fun Deadpool film. Deadpool doesn't really do anything \"bad-ass\" in this film, he's very funny but doesn't do anything that stands out really. A very excellent entry to the Deadpool franchise, but by the end of it, I wasn't asking for a Deadpool 3, not because I didn't want one, but because this movie feels like a conclusion for his story.",

Seriously watch both credits and wait afterward for the song that plays. ",
