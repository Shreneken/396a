Every scene is almost a stand alone with no link to past and future scenes. There are so many plot threads that lead no where. All the dialogue is very bland and just boring. \nThis film was so frustrating, because it had great potential, but it is totally ruined by the terrible story. \nStay away unless you are deaf and you just want to see nice pictures.",

            "content": "It must have been a few years back when I first saw the concept art for this movie before it was even released. I was excited, I saw the potential and I couldn't wait to watch it. In fact, I wanted to watch it so bad that I remembered the movie a few years later when it was released in English so I sought it out and watched it. I have to say that I've never been so massively disappointed in a movie before. \nWhat disappointed me most was the lack of utilization of the amazing, stunning, beautiful background scenes, characters, and their powers. The story was a dull and uninteresting, done-before, story of a stupid girl falling in love and not realizing that being selfish in love leads to consequences. \nThere are magical powers shown beyond comprehensions, beautiful nature scenes, characters with weird and interesting traits like horns, but none of these incredibly interesting details are the focus in any point of the story.\nThe movie didn't need any of what they showed in order to make the story work. \nA story of a stupid lovestruck girl doesn't need a background setting infinitely more interesting than her or any of her troubles. \nI can only feel sorry for the creators to make all of these amazing intricate details in the story that are only shown for a small fraction of the movie. All the potential is completely flushed down the toilet in this movie. \nSome people compare it to Ghibli, and I can see where they're coming from, but Ghibli doesn't make the fatal mistake of making their setting more interesting than the character and their story. Ghibli fully utilizes the scenery, the objects in the background, the supporting characters, to add to the story rather than take away from it. You're left with an impression and a sense of satisfaction from watching the movie, not with frustration of how badly done the movie was and left thinking of how much better IT COULD HAVE BEEN. \nOne time I saw beautiful pictures of a woman who must have spent thousands on an extravagant gender reveal party. It was above and beyond and you can just imagine how amazing that party must have been. But here's the kicker, it was all for a pregnant horse.\nThat's exactly what this movie is, it sets you up for something amazing only to give you a complete joke.",

It's just a one sided love. Though she did love him but not in the same way. I do believe he deserved better.
