    "summary": "When, by executive decree, all the canine pets of Megasaki City are exiled to a vast garbage-dump called Trash Island, 12-year-old Atari sets off alone in a miniature Junior-Turbo Prop and flies across the river in search of his bodyguard-dog, Spots. There, with the assistance of a pack of newly-found mongrel friends, he begins an epic journey that will decide the fate and future of the entire Prefecture.",

The story is engaging and emotionally resonant, with a perfect balance of humor and heart. While some may find the pacing a bit slow, the film's overall execution is masterful and deserving of its critical acclaim. Overall, I highly recommend Isle of Dogs to anyone looking for a visually stunning and emotionally satisfying cinematic experience.",

Wes Anderson's Isle of Dogs has everything you love (or hate) about Anderson movies – spectacular and creative visuals, witty dialogue, interesting characters, and, as with his previous animated film Fantastic Mr. Fox, great stop motion animation.  Despite a story that often seems to meander aimlessly, Isle of Dogs has more than enough to offer to offset any shortcomings.  And the dogs are unbearably cute.",

            "content": "Criminally underrated and one of the best stop motions films alongside fantastic mr Fox, Isle of Dogs deserves more praise from critics and audiences alike. Most critical reviews rightly compliment that Beauty Wes Anderson produces. I would say it's his most visually stunning film, beating out all his other visually masterful films which says a lot to how great this movie is crafted. The critics of the film come with the characters and stories themselves:. The consensus seems to be that the story and characters whilst good don't make you connect with them like a Mr Fox or Gustave for example. Though I agree those characters are more relatable and engaging the characters and story here is still no doubt fantastic. There's no real protagonist, we have the pack of dogs Chief being the main leader and the boy who all adventure together to find his old dog spots. The lack of a dead set protagonist is in my opinion not harmful at all. It's true that the rest of the dogs in Chiefs pack are underdeveloped but was there any need to develop them? They are there for comical effect but they needed no either purpose in the narrative. Chief and the boy hold the narrative up incredibly well enough, rounding the story in satisfying character arcs and a great ending. Overall I think isle of dogs story and characters of Chief deserve more respect alongside the beauty the film presents with all the hand crafted sets and characters etc. A criminally unappreciated fantastic movie.",

            "content": "Wes Anderson's Isle of Dogs is different. The animation style (of humans) is —to be frank— a little scary and even gross. Like why do humans look like that? It's not bad animation, just different.\n\nIt's a pretty sad first act. It pulls you into the story quickly because you wanna know what's going to happen next but it honestly breaks your heart in the process. Trust me when I say that it gets so much better. At certain points in the film you're overcome by emotion, you laugh, you gasp and your eyes widen, and so much more. Definitely worth the watch!\n\nA stacked cast and amazing attention to detail, what more could you ask for in a stop motion film? Andy Gent, Anderson's \"right hand man\" is a master at his craft. The fur on the dogs and the movement of everything is beautiful. This is probably my favorite stop motion film I've seen because there are just so many amazing moments like when a dog is staring into the ocean and their fur is blowing or when a tv screen shows a computer generated character… it's gorgeous.\n\nIt has it's moments of comedy too. There's a few times where I laughed out loud at unexpected jokes which I loved! It's not a full on comedy movie, but the times when they do slide a joke in there is hilarious. Thank you Jason Schwartzman (honestly, he probably didn't write those jokes but I like to believe that he did)\n\nTHE BENTO BOX SCENE! This will go down as the most satisfying scene I've ever watched in an animated film. I watched it once, then played it over again, just to see it one more time. So gorgeous.\n\nMy one and only critique is that it drags on for just a little too long. There were points that could be sped up and the movie could've ended a lot sooner… towards the end I kept clicking to see how much time was left. Feel good ending though so it was worth the wait! So enjoyable!\n\nLast thing I'll say (reiterate), the look of this film is wonderful. Once you get past the people, that is. Every scene had me saying wow under my breath because it's just so intricate and beautiful. Really enjoyed watching this, probably wouldn't watch it alone again just because it's not something that generally intrigues me but it was good! Only two more Wes films until I've finished his entire filmography!!",

It was a visual treat - I noted to myself multiple times throughout the film that some frames would look lovely on my wall. There's a picturesque beauty in the grimy garbage heaps and derelict structures that are the backdrops of the film. The voice actors were phenomenal, giving the dogs rich personalities that I like to imagine are how my animals might sound when I'm not around (oh, come on - you do it, too...right?) They are helped by dialogue that is snappy and well written. It's not quite funny enough to me - I like the deadpan sense of humor, but in this case it was in a way that you sort of chuckle and move from on rather than really deeply enjoy, like a series of witty Sunday comic strips tied together. The story is an initially breezy, and later exciting, brand of fun as it follows a young boy who, with the help of a pack of feral dogs, searches for his lost pet. There are welcome hints of noir influence as it deals with the political intrigue surrounding the circumstances of the dogs quarantine from society. Anderson's eccentricity and style can be a bit much as it teeters on the brink of self-indulgence, but this time he pulls it off with the right combination of talent, imagery, and lovable puppers.",

There is no main antagonist in the film.\nIt's about a boy (voice of Koyu Rankin) journeys there to rescue his dog Spots (Liev Schreiber), and gets help from a pack of misfit canines who have also been exiled. His quest inspires a group of dog lovers to expose a government conspiracy. \nI recommend the film 5 out of 5 stars because it has good Japanese transliteration and English in it. My father and me really love the film because we are study multiple cultures.

If that person went on to bravely say they hate him, I would stand firmly with them and be brave enough at that point to say I hate him too, because everyone seems to love him, and if I was alone in my censure I would be shouted down. I cannot stand him in any way, shape or form. I can watch the first ten seconds of a movie and know it's him. In everything he does his a** is sticking out for all to see. It's all so contrived, so quintessentially Wes Anderson. I was told years ago that when telling a story you should get out of the way. He does the polar opposite in every single second of every scene of every movie he's ever done, and I for one KNOW, for all its great acting, shooting, production, what have you, it's all about Wes Anderson. He will never let the story be itself. Wes Anderson is, \"Look at me, look how cool I am, how creative and quirky and funny and amazing I am. Don't you understand? Can't you feel my AMAZINGNESS?!\" The dialogue is third rate, what's supposed to be funny isn't, and the cloying, melodramatic narrative is ALL Wes \"Big A**\" Anderson. I hate it. HATE, just so we're clear. Red flag, don't-marry-someone-if-they-like-Wes-Anderson hate. Now, if you'll excuse me, I think I'll go read a couple pages of Hemingway to clear my palate.",

I think it felt creepy just because the shots were done in ways that just simply aren't done because directors or photographers are taught 'THIS IS WRONG!  NEVER DO THIS!'.  Like having all the subjects facing directly at the viewer shoulder to shoulder close together like you might see in a high school yearbook from 1980 for 'senior chess club'.

The fight scenes seem like they have been picked out of from a comic strip so as not to seem too violent, I liked this a lot. Bryan Cranston's voiceover was the standout for me moving from strong and authoritative to soft, caring and lovable. Edward Norton's voiceover was refreshingly funny. The most unprecedented factor in this movie is the exceeding relevance it carries in todays society. The themes range widely from moronic politicians to pollution and its adverse effects. The film subtly hints at the future of the Earth through the vast amount of garbage in the movie and says how that will be our situation soon if we don't take actions.

The story follows Atari, the mayor's son, as he escapes home to save his lost dog, Spot. The government has banned all dogs from the city after a deadly strain of snout flu breaks out. The script is mediocre, however, the overall look of the movie more than makes up for it. Since this is an animated movie, Wes Anderson is able to play with a much larger scale than all of his other movies. This is done by making the film more of a science fiction, large scale, action film. As mentioned, the movie is visually spectacular. This movie isn't Wes Anderson's first attempt at an animated feature, Fantastic Mr. Fox was (for lack of a better term) fantastic, and this movie has a very similar quality. The art takes a key element from Japanese culture, which made the movie world very vibrant and exciting. A lot of the voice acting is wonderful, Bill Murray and Edward Norton being stand outs. The language barrier between the dogs and Atari was different from other movies featuring the same kind of language barrier. The dogs have a hard time understanding Atari, ergo allowing us to connect more with the dogs. The dogs themselves are all very unique, and each one ends the perfect way. Though, as I mentioned, the script is only mediocre. The dialogue certainly wasn't the best of Anderson's movies, although dialogue has never been one of his large strengths, though don't get me wrong, I wouldn't call any of the dialogues in his films ‘bad.' I'm not okay with admitting how long it took me to figure out the pun in the name, but it was worth it. In the end, Isle of Dogs is a wonderful, fantastical, animated movie by Wes Anderson. And while the script isn't always the best, nearly every other aspect of it is really enjoyable. It's a very fun watch, and I would highly recommend it. 8.2/10 from me.",

Wes Anderson works his magic and showcases his skill at set-building in every single scene. The choice of stop-motion allows Anderson an insane amount of detail. From individual hairs to random fleas that scurry, no piece of detail gets left out. Each scene is beautiful and stands out on their own. Colors and visuals and media styles mix and blend together to create a beautiful film. The animation is nothing less than captivating.\n\nBut the film is more than a delight to the eyes, it's a delight to the ears as well. The music and sounds were perfect. Loved the music throughout. The voice cast was well selected. It's fun guessing which person is playing which character.\n\nThe plot was unique and heartwarming. Who can't like a story about a boy and his dog? There are some suspenseful moments, it's a feel-good movie throughout.\n\nI enjoyed the nod to Japanese culture and Anderson's choice of not having subtitles. Though confusing at first, it increases the level of immersion. Double points for accurate Japanese. That's one area most American filmmakers neglect.\n\nI don't think any animated 2018 film could have topped this.\n\n5/5. I loved it. Sorry, cat-lovers.",

Cleverly and respectfully appropriating Japanese cinema and art makes for a uniquely beautiful film and one that renders the audience in the same camp as the dogs: unable to understand everything except for tone and a few choice words. \nThere's something special about hearing these legendary voices behind these hand animated creatures, and Wes Anderson has, in the dogs, created a sort of very refreshingly sweet, honest pack of fun characters for this adventure that intentionally don't fit the stereotypes you would associate with Alphas. \nThere's very little not to like about this movie except for the fact that it's very much of little consequence.

It was a visual treat - I noted to myself multiple times throughout the film that some frames would look lovely on my wall. There's a picturesque beauty in the grimy garbage heaps and derelict structures that are the backdrops of the film. The voice actors were phenomenal, giving the dogs rich personalities that I like to imagine are how my animals might sound when I'm not around (oh, come on - you do it, too...right?) They are helped by dialogue that is snappy and well written. It's not quite funny enough to me - I like the deadpan sense of humor, but in this case it was in a way that you sort of chuckle and move from on rather than really deeply enjoy, like a series of witty Sunday comic strips tied together. The story is an initially breezy, and later exciting, brand of fun as it follows a young boy who, with the help of a pack of feral dogs, searches for his lost pet. There are welcome hints of noir influence as it deals with the political intrigue surrounding the circumstances of the dogs quarantine from society. Anderson's eccentricity and style can be a bit much as it teeters on the brink of self-indulgence, but this time he pulls it off with the right combination of talent, imagery, and lovable puppers.",

It's not like someone who's painfully unfunny, it's just . . . whatever. He manages to pull together some good casts, I'll say that. Lots of well-respected white people work with Wes Anderson.

Much like his previous stop motion animated film Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009) Isle of Dogs is a very charming story with some really great voice acting. Set in the near future in Japan Isle of Dogs tells the tale of a Japan that has been overrun by a canine influenza that has affected all the dogs on the island. Mayor Kobayashi (Kunichi Nomura) signs a bill that sends ll the dogs to Trash Island to keep them isolated from humans. Six months go by and a young boy named Atari (Koyu Rankin) crash lands onto Trash Island looking for his dog Spots (Liev Schreiber). He befriends some stray dogs on the island named Chief (Bryan Cranston), Rex (Edward Norton), King (Bob Balaban), Duke (Jeff Goldblum) & Boss (Bill Murray). Together they guide Atari through the island searching for Spots and along the way discovering a conspiracy about what's really going on. The film looks great. The use of the stop motion here is perfect and gives it a very distinct style. In a very Wes Anderson kind of way the film blends story, music and cinematography to give it the vibe you may be familiar with if you're a fan of Anderson's films. The film has a lot of little quirky moments and although I wouldn't say this is better than Fantastic Mr. Fox I did find it very close to that one and enjoyed it. Plus come on it's a movie about dogs that talk and have a witty sense of humor what's not to like. This is a solid film that I really enjoyed and would recommend checking out!",

            "content": "I admit that I am predisposed to love this movie.  It's all there in the name - if you haven't caught it, the title is a homonym of sorts for \"I Love Dogs\"... and indeed, I do love dogs!  Now, you don't have to love dogs to love this movie... but even if you don't, I'll bet you that by the end of this movie, you'll love them a little more.  It is just delightful.   This is a Wes Anderson film, so you know even before it starts that it's going to be chock full of charm, whimsy, and symmetry, and it does not disappoint on any of those counts.  Anderson is one of the most original and innovative filmmakers working today; he has become a master of the medium and uses it in ways that no one else does, creating films that are always uniquely his.  Though this is an animated film, it's a pretty adult movie with mature themes - I would say it's probably not the best choice for small kids, but it's great for older ones.  The whole film is an allegory for xenophobia and the disenfranchisement of marginalized populations (the film is ostensibly set in bizarro-world Japan, but I would argue that the attitudes of the people in this film are more similar to American culture right now).  That's a lot going on for an animated film, but its genius is that it's also really funny, sweet, and surprisingly sentimental.  This is a film that brilliantly toes the line between darkness and lightness, illustrating serious themes with humorous execution.  For some reason, the way the characters all look straight into the camera creates such a comedic effect.  The reaction shots alone are priceless... and those little dog-sneezes!  Adorable!   The ending is a little contrived, but whatever, I wanted the happy ending and was willing to sacrifice realism to get it.  This is definitely my favorite movie of 2018 (so far), it is such a joy.  He is a smart and clever man, that Wes Anderson, and he has made a smart and clever movie that is massively appealing while also delivering a potent message.  Standing O.",

Some critics say it holds up, some critics say it's too much, and everyone has an opinion on where it fits in the Anderson canon. As a Wes Anderson novice, here's my take; Isle of Dogs charms, pleases, and keeps you on the edge of your seat, often squinting at the excruciating detail. It's a thought provoking tale of childishness, exile, and most importantly, dogs, \nIt is with incredible speed that Isle of Dogs diagrams itself out. A quick narrator (who is, of course, a dog) and explanatory inter-shot text cards waste no time setting the scene. The Kobayashi Dynasty, a vicious cat loving empire set on the annihilation of dog-kind, reigns over a feudal Japan. Dogs are on the cusp of extinction. Suddenly, a boy samurai appears, beheads the leader of the Kobayashi, and recites his haiku,\n\"I turn my back.\nOn Mankind!\nFrost on windowpane.\"\nThe audience is given a moment to think about this. Then, a rapid cut reveals kids in a school auditorium, purposefully drumming. These kids serve as the score for much of film, to great effect until you start noticing it (If you haven't watched it yet, sorry!) but here, they stop. We're shown Megasaki, a wonderfully detailed city in a near-future Japan. Haunting singing and slow pans of empty streets build tension. Everyone's in the town hall. Mayor Kobayashi (we're told by an interpreter, only barking is translated.) unveils a decree; because of the rampant dog flu and overpopulation, all dogs in Megasaki will be banished to Trash Island, the Isle of Dogs. Professor Watanabe, desperately appeals to the crowd. He's nearly found a cure for the Dog Flu. After a somber \"Whatever happened to 'man's best friend?\" he's booed down. The audience calls for immediate ratification of the decree, and Spots, Kobayashi's dog, is wheeled out in a locked cage to be deported.\nSix months pass. Atari Kobayashi, distant nephew and adopted ward to the Mayoral Household, has stolen a prop plane to go find Spots. He crashes and meets Rex, Duke, King, Boss and Chief. Four pets and a curmudgeonly stray, in that order. They're a rag-tag crew just trying to survive in their new harsh landscape. Atari doggedly gets up from the crash site, snaps off a piece of metal lodged in his head, the holds out a photo of Spots for the dogs to see. He's come prepared for the coming journey.\nThese opening shots are (from what I know) classic Anderson; sheer, diagraming angles, camera facing characters, rapid cuts; the cinematography in this film is Anderson untethered, and it comes out at crane-neck speeds. The first time through, I felt dragged; I was a toddler walking a mastiff. Gags and goofy lines like \"beheaded the head of the head of the Kobayashi clan,\" kept me from being left in the stop-motion cotton ball dust, but I kept a far better pace the second time through. The atmosphere these shots provide is a perfect launchpad for most of the rest of the film, but a too-long ending sees that plane set a little too soon. Isle of Dogs is best when this momentum is present.\nIsle of Dogs splays out some harsh realities of the world, starting with scheming, political corruption, and abandoning sick dogs to die on an island made out of trash. However, another point of view shows an Isle of Dogs about cat-lovers fighting dog-lovers with evil robot dogs and wasabi poison. It's childish, and that really makes the film. Even the animation contributes; it's a cartoon! Complete with explosions and dustball brawls. Just look at the title. These two faces play brilliant foils for one another, which becomes clearer and clearer as the film goes on. Atari risks everything to save the last friend he has. Mayor Kobayashi hates dogs because he's with the cats and cats must hate dogs. Atari hijacks an airplane to go visit an island full of dogs. Mayor Kobayashi struggles with the burden of following his family's way. All of the human plot-movers in Isle of Dogs are children acting like adults or adults acting like children.\nThe human cast of this movie may have a lot going on, but this movie stands on more that two legs. This movie is also about dogs, and in this case, outcasts. Many of the Isle's dogs lead lives  very human lives back on the mainland; they were mascots, actors, bodyguards, and show dogs. Chief, our main pooch played by Bryan Cranston, was a stray. Before Atari's arrival and the subsequent adventure, a brief glimpse shows how life happens on the Isle of Dogs. Roving packs fight for every meal. It's dog-eat-dog anarchy. However, the pack we follow has built within itself an order. They're a democracy. There's no leader; they're all leaders. They vote one way while Chief disagrees and begrudgingly follows. When they all decide to help the little pilot, Chief growls and stands off. \"I bite.\" he says when Atari tries to pet him. It might seem like being shipped off to a trash island might be an equalizer for the dogs, perhaps with the survival-savvy strays coming out on top, Chief is still in some ways the outcast of the party. Deep down, he does want to help Atari find his dog; in the same way, he wants to find a home too, however reluctant he is to admit it. So, when in the middle of another vote a trolley unexpectedly splits leaving Chief with Atari, it's one of the most interesting points of character development in the film. Chief has lost his pack, the only home he's ever known up until that point, and he's stuck with this kid who want him to act like his pet, which goes against everything he stands for. Eventually though, Chief finds his home through Atari. They play fetch. Atari gives Chief a comically effective bath. When they finally regroup with the rest of the pack for the main adventure to resume, we have a much better understanding of both Chief and Atari.\nWes Anderson's Isle of Dogs meticulous scrolls through a thousand beautiful dioramas. The stop-motion is immersive and the characters are full of life. Expect droll humor, novel shots, and visual gags. Under the surface? It's got themes and motifs worth gnawing on for a while. Isle of Dogs is solid. It's a little too long, but otherwise amazing.\n\n(Note: All credit of this movie review is due to Ulysses S Hale.)",

            "content": "Director Wes Anderson's latest film is a stop-motion animated curiosity taking place in a miniature version of future Japan (capital city, Megasaki).  Taking inspiration from the Rankin-Bass Christmas specials (e.g. Rudolph), this is a fun (but grown-up) adventure, telling how a dog-hating mayor evicts all canines to \"Trash Island\" where they are left to die, suffering from dog-flu and snout-fever and all manner of other ailments.  It is Anderson's renowned attention to whimsical detail that sees his characters perpetually sneezing throughout the film - but of course, that's just one small example.  Although the dogs speak in English, most of the other characters speak in Japanese, only occasionally translated (by a variety of interpreters or electronic translating machines).  The human hero of the tale, a 12-year-old boy named Atari (voiced by Koyu Rankin), flies a small junior aircraft to Trash Island to find his former pet bodyguard, Spots (voiced by Liev Schreiber).  He is assisted by four former pet dogs (voiced by Edward Norton, Bob Balaban, Jeff Goldblum, and Bill Murray) and a stray (voiced by Bryan Cranston).  They have quite the adventure.  A teenaged human exchange student (voiced by Greta Gerwig) also helps by fighting the corrupt government and exposing an evil conspiracy.  Along the way, Anderson enjoys spoofing and/or paying homage to Japanese culture.  There is probably too much to look at or to take in for just one sitting. The music is less song based than in other Anderson features - for example, some of the music is apparently drawn from Seven Samurai (1954) -- but there is also the West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band's \"I Won't Hurt You\" (which certainly fits with what we know of Anderson's musical taste).  Harvey Keitel, Scarlett Johansson, Yoko Ono, and F. Murray Abraham also lend their vocal talents, along with an array of Japanese actors.  As with Anderson's other output, you really need to be on his wavelength to appreciate this - and I was (and have been).  So, if you have liked his other films, you won't be disappointed with this one.  I found it silly but highly enjoyable.",

Edward Norton (Rex) is fun, Bill Murray (Boss) is his usual great self, and Jeff Goldblum (Duke) is a blast with his constant ârumors.â? Thatâ(TM)s not even including the smaller voice roles by Frances McDormand (Interpreter Nelson), Scarlett Johansson (Nutmeg), Courtney B. Vance (Narrator), and more. There are heartwarming moments sprinkled in throughout, and an adventure that really tugs at your emotions. The script gives us big moments, strong characters, and natural dialogue.

There are plenty of laughs and a surprisingly large amount of plot twists that add up to one hell of a ride.\n\nWeaknesses: This movie doesnâ(TM)t fully work as a kidâ(TM)s film. Itâ(TM)s kind of marketed towards them, but there are some violent moments that are a bit much for children. Some of the characters feel a bit underused. Nutmeg is one who couldâ(TM)ve done more and had a more established relationship with Chief. It was just kind of glossed over, so it didnâ(TM)t fully click. Most of the soundtrack seems to miss the mark.\n\nOverall: The criticisms I found were mostly nitpicks. This movie is incredible. Itâ(TM)s creative, fun, witty, and heartwarming. It only ranks behind Avengers: Infinity War for the best of the year.",

The cinematography also made scenes more impactful especially those in which strong emotions like humor and anger are involved.\n\nAnother thing that I found very interesting in the movie was the way Japanese was used. With a Western and English-speaking audience, it would be assumed that Japanese be subtitled by Anderson in order for viewers to understand what these lines mean, but then, to my surprise, he didn't. There must be a reason behind this, and I believe that this measure was done in order to make the audience think. Viewers are used to having information served onto them on a silver platter but then having un-subtitled Japanese forced viewers, forced me to pay attention to every single minor detail in order to use them as context clues to decipher the hieroglyphics that is Japanese. This really helped me appreciate the stop motion animation and the movie as a whole.",

            "content": "Dogs are often called a man's best friend. But, what if the opposite were to happen and dogs became man's worst fear? Witty, adventurous, and eccentric. Wes Anderson creates yet another masterpiece which is his latest film. Like most Anderson films, the protagonist/s is often set upon a wild long journey. Whether its a journey of self-discovery, resolving of family issues, or just adventures in general. Isle of Dogs takes the same classic signature Anderson elements but develops these into a new and refreshing idea that does not fail to entertain the audience once again. The story revolves around the lives of dogs in Trash Island after being exiled from Megasaki City. They journey within its grounds after the governor's son arrives here in search of his dog and how they are able to return back to their homeland. The film pulls viewers into its story through its unique storyline and characters. Dogs are normally not protagonists of films. But, the fantasy-based plot leaves viewers strapped to their seats, wanting to see the next events that will happen in the film. Anderson utilizes his fictional ideas, placed into film to create a one of a kind story, making us invest in the film, which is typical of Anderson's films. The unique story of this film makes this piece a movie to watch for all people wanting something new to add to their collection of movies. \n\nMajority of the film, the dialogue between the dogs and humans are separeted by the language barrier of the English speaking dogs to the Japanese dialect the humans speak in. When watching the film, the viewer is left without subtitles for these parts. Some people might say the subtitles were left out because it helps us to pay more attention to the film and try to grasp the meaning of those scenes. Some people might say that it represents the reality of our relationship with dogs and how we as the viewers are placed in the shoes of the dogs in the film. I believe that Wes Anderson intentionally left out the subtitles for the Japanese parts because he wants the audience to interpret his film in their own way and how they see and understand it. There is no right or wrong interpretation of his film but rather it is left to audience to discuss and understand his film in their own way and what they see as best fit to them.",

            "content": "Let me start this by saying that I have literally never been more excited for a movie in my life. The only other occurence I can think of is my pre-teen mind going wild to see The Hunger Games back in 2012, but believe it or not, I've changed over the past six years. Ever since the first social media postings, and the release of the first trailer- cut to \"I don't think i can stomach anymore of this garbage\"-  I've been hooked. One of my favorite kids' movies has always been Fantastic Mr Fox, a movie that I believe demonstrates that kids movies can be an art, and don't have to be dumbed down and pointless; so seeing Anderson return to stop motion warmed my pre-teen heart and made me really nostalgic. Upon first look at the trailer, one thing can be immediately seen. The animation.\n\tHoly shit, the animation. While Fantastic Mr. Fox's animation was choppy and a bit awkward, Isle of Dogs is fluid, absolutely ridiculously detailed, and so gorgeous, it's hard to believe that they didn't have a constantly rotating group of animators due to jumping out the damn windows from boredom-caused insanity. Wes was dipping his toe into the pool of stop motion, testing the waters, seeing how things felt. In Isle of Dogs, Wes say his faults in animation, had a stronger budget, and took a complete cannonball, soaking the deck of the pool, and pissing off the neighbors' kids as he did so.\n\n\tIsle of Dogs is a refreshingly original story in a time where all movies seem to be adaptations, sequels, or reboots; and where all kids movies seem to be Sherlock Gnomes. It tells the story of a pack of dogs exiled to Trash Island, due to the demands of a totalitarian leader Mayor Kobayashi, who wishes to eradicate all dogs through manipulation of the public, lies, and violence; even going so far as to work with the Yakuza, a notorious transnational organized crime group in Japan. More specifically, it follows the mayor's distant nephew, and ward to the Mayoral Household, Atari Kobayashi, who was orphaned three years before the story takes place due to a devastating train derailment. He was gifted Spots Kobayashi, his personal bodyguard dog, upon entry to the Brick Mansion. To kick off the dog displacement, and just to show he really means business, Mayor Kobayashi sends off Spots as the very first dog to be exiled, Dog Zero. The movie follows Atari, and his search for Spots, with the help of Chief, a rough stray dog from the streets of Central Megasaki, Rex, a wiry haired and quirky dog owned by a schoolmaster, Boss, the mascot of the Megasaki Dragons baseball team, Duke, a gossip loving husky, and King, the famous Doggy Chop dog.\n\tWhile the trailer may seem to show that the dogs will perform as an ensemble cast, the real limelight goes to Chief, who's aggressive and rude demeanor contrasts with the hopeful and determined dog lover Atari. Their growing friendship and teamwork is wonderful, and something I'll cover later in the video. The truth is, Rex, Boss, Duke, and King really disappear halfway into the movie and don't show up until much later, leaving the real character development to be with Chief and Atari. This does bring up a bit of a problem, since while we see a character arc and lots of personal development with Chief, the other dogs are merely decorations to the story, whether it be Rex, to be the social leader of the group, calling upon them to take votes,  King, to do really nothing but occasionally add to the discussion, Duke, who adds a typical Jeff Goldblum-esque comic relief, or Boss, a character that even after four viewings, I still struggle to see his purpose. Chief is the emotional drive, and the others are simple characters to accompany and garnish.\n\tIsle of Dogs tells its story in a series of chapters, flashbacks, going back and forth in time freely, and switching from the characters on Trash Island to the characters back on Megasaki. While it would seem that juggling so many different times and places would surely cause the story to collapse into a confusing mess. Wes Anderson manages to bridge them all in an easily accessible way, where you always know where, when, and why you are in a certain place. If you were seeing this film for the first time, you would have absolutely no problem figuring out what was happening. I have to give props to the storytellers for being able to constantly say things like \"Three Years Earlier\", \"End of Flashback\", and \"A Few Months Earlier\" without sounding like the French title card narrator from Spongebob Squarepants.\n\tOne departure that Isle of Dogs took from the other works of Wes Anderson is that the story is full. There is not much to be left up to interpretation, it doesn't end on an ambiguous note, and it certainly doesn't have the audience guess and theorize what the ending could be. As a matter of fact, the last ten minutes or so of the film go into detail how the story concluded, and what the characters are up to now. With that being said, Isle of Dogs leaves the viewer feeling satisfied, almost as if the movie was a storybook. I found this particularly interesting considering that this is a Wes Anderson film. In Fantastic Mr. Fox, the animals make their home burrowed under the Boggis, Bunce, and Bean supermarket, a lucky instance, but not without the grim reminder that they are still living underground, and they can't steal from the same place forever. In Moonrise Kingdom, in an ending that made me cry for about two hours, Suzy and Sam are allowed to stay together, however it is hidden to all except Captain Sharp, who drives Sam to and from Suzy's house for their daily visits. In The Grand Budapest Hotel, The Author moves off to South America, never to return to the hotel, and the fate of Zero is completely unknown. In Isle of Dogs, Atari becomes the mayor, he gets the girl, keeps the dog, and everyone lived happily ever after.\n\nI love the story very much, but good god, the sets, character designs, and camerawork are just so wonderful. Fans and parodyers alike of Wes Anderson are highly familiar with his esoteric style of centering shots, rather stilted dialogue, quirky stories and characters, and meticulous effort into perfectionism. I am happy to say that Isle of Dogs may very well be the most Wes Anderson thing to ever come out of Wes Anderson. I would highly suggest you watch the \"making of\" videos released by Fox Searchlight. These videos go in depth and provide us a look into the development in this film, and if you don't believe every shred of my voice when I say that this movie took a shit ton of effort, just watch a second of any of these videos.\n\tI really believe that Isle of Dogs is a significant step forward in the animation medium. The sad truth is, that most casual movie viewers see animation as a kids medium, something that only children can enjoy, and something that can only convey a silly story. Isle of Dogs is political corruption. It's dark, it's morbid, and it's mature. What animation fans and animation itself both need is more movies like this.\nAll in all, I truly believe that Isle of Dogs is something special. I'm glad to have been following it for so long, and I truly believe that it was worth the wait. You best believe I'm gonna buy the blu ray as soon as it comes out. And on the chance that it's still in theatres when you see this video, definitely treat yourself, and check it out.",

Though, the intention of not adding English subtitles to Japanese dubbed sections of the movie may present itself as being in one with the Japanese and (in turn) be a way to improve its art authenticity among viewers of a certain calibre.

            "content": "Aesthetically creative beyond belief is the only adequate way to describe the set of Wes Anderson's 2018 Isle of Dogs. Similar to his past films, Moonrise Kingdom, Grand Budapest Hotel and Rushmore, Anderson puts an artistic twist on storytelling. This film is packed from start to finish with a creative storyline, amazingly aesthetic sets and shots, and clever subtle political standpoints. Anderson showcases his phenomenal talent that is worth an oscar or two.\n\n \"Dogs\" is an incredibly detailed stop-motion film about a Dystopian Japanese archipelago 20 years into the future. The setting takes place in a fictional city named Megasaki. When an unknown cause of dog flu breaks out into the city, all canine species are banned by the government to Trash Island, which is exactly what it sounds like. In attempt to find his beloved dog, a young boy, Atari Kobayashi sets out to Trash Island and becomes acquainted with a pack of exiled Alpha dogs who have no leader among them. The dogs are all played by American actors and have very American personalities. At first, the dogs are stunned when they find something alive on the island, and take a vote whether they should eat him or not. In an unanimous vote to not eat the boy, the Alpha dogs then decide to team up with Atari and look for his dog, Spots. While Atari and the Alphas are searching the island, back in Japan are a group of pro-dog students and scientists searching for a cure and fighting for their pets lives. I won't spoil the outcome, but if you pay close attention at the beginning of the film, Anderson spoils the whole plot in the first five minutes. He starts out with a narrator telling a story of the Megasaki ancestors. This story is a parable for everything we are about to see in the next hour and forty minutes.\n\nThe cleverness of the film can be seen even in the title of the movie. \"Isle of dogs\" said out loud matches \"I love dogs\", which by the film we can see that Anderson really does love dogs. The creativeness of the storyline lets us see a fusion of Japanese humans and American dogs and it also allows us to see the difference of Japanese and American culture. In the scene when Atari crashlands on Trash Island, the dogs (who only speak English), are extremely confused when Atari (who only speaks Japanese) tries giving them commands. One dog comments \"I wish somebody spoke his language.\" This part is not just to show the linguistic barriers between dog and human, but also between most Japanese and American citizens. The Japanese humans in the film only speak in their native tongue and are not given subtitles. Besides an occasional on-screen translator and an American foreign exchange student, no other humans in the movie speak English. This is a way of obviously showing one difference in American and Japanese culture, and also one creative way of letting the audience know what it is like to be a dog and not understand what they are being told most of the time.\n\nThroughout the incredibly creative story, we watch beautiful and eye-pleasing art in motion. Following four prominent themes- dogs, trash, facial expression, and Japanese aesthetic, Anderson's film shows how much he has grown as a director. The clean lines and symmetrical shots are just the beginning of the genius mind of Anderson. The movie has the same comedy and cleverness of his fan-favorite, heart-warming 2009, Fantastic Mr. Fox, but this time, Anderson has pulled out all the stops and has held nothing back. He uses outstanding detail in all the stop-motion puppets. Each one is uniquely crafted to fit the personality of the character. The dogs are all given specific looks and show some sign of trauma in their eyes. Let's not forget the outstanding sets of each shot. Trash Island is beautiful. Sounds ironic given the name of the island, but when you notice the detail of each piece of trash and the color scheme of it all, it really comes to life. The facial expressions tell much of the story. Since a lot of the movie is in Japanese, the body language of the characters does an adequate job of telling the story. The whole vibe of the movie is very Japanese. The music and colors used all give off the Japanese film feel. Anderson does a great job in showing his well-known love and respect for Japanese film and culture.\n\nAlthough the story on the surface is a simple tale of a boy and \"man's best friend\", the detail of the script and set are extremely political. Like Anderson's other films, the characters in Isle of Dogs follow a pattern of revolt. In this story the pro-dog students, scientist, dogs, and Atari are all revolting against their government and the act that banned the dogs. The film shows aspects of very American styled protest. In one very political shot, the pro-dog students protesting against the government and are shown with one fist in the air like the American Black Power group. If you look closely the students are all wearing pins that say \"Pro-Watanabe\". (Watanabe is the scientist finding a cure for dog flu). The unique thing about these pins is that they are all red white and blue. The colors of the American flag are used very wisley. If the pins were any other colors, they would not give off the patriotic, protesting, rallying-the-troops sort of feel. If these two details do not represent an American style of revolt, I don't know what does. I give my kudos to Wes Anderson and congratulate him on how much his growth as a director shows in this film. I also thank him for the breath of fresh air this film has given me from what I have seen in the theaters this year.",

            "content": "Isle Of Dogs\n(2018)\n\nPlot:\nVisionary director Wes Anderson's 'Isle of Dogs' tells the story of Atari Kobayashi, 12-year-old ward to corrupt Mayor Kobayashi. When all the canine pets of Megasaki City are exiled to vast Trash Island, Atari sets off in search of his bodyguard dog, Spots. With the assistance of his newfound mongrel friends, he begins an epic journey that will decide the fate and future of the entire Prefecture.\n\nReview:\nI'm usually a big fan of Wes Anderson movies but I really struggled with this one. The cast was amazing but the storyline was overcomplicated when it didn't have to be. He obviously didn't make this animated film about talking dogs, for a young market because I really can't see the political element being entertaining for kids. I did enjoy the emotional content, between the dog and the child, and the animation, which is the same as the Fantastic Mr. Fox, was unique but I did get a bit bored of the plot after a while. Anyway, the movie is set in the near future in Japan, were a canine flu virus spreads across the population, with a risk of crossing to humans. The mayor of Megasaki City, Kobayashi, signs a decree banishing all dogs to Trash Island, despite a scientist named Professor Watanabe insisting he is close to finding a cure for the dogs. The first to be exiled is Spots, who belonged to Atari Kobayashi, the orphaned nephew and ward of the mayor. Six months later, Atari flies to trash island to try and find spots but his plane crashes, and a pack of dogs, led by Chief, rush to his rescue. When Atari tells the dogs about Spots, they agree to help him on his mission but Chief, a former stray, is reluctant to help humans. Chief decides to follow them on there journey and to seek advice from Jupiter and the Oracle. Meanwhile, Professor Watanabe finds a cure for the dog-flu but Kobayashi refuses to lift the dog ban. After criticizing Kobayashi's decision, Watanabe is put on house arrest and is killed by poisoned wasabi in sushi. A radical American exchange student, Tracy Walker, suspects a conspiracy and begins to investigate. Kobayashi claims that Atari was kidnapped by the dogs and vows to kill them as punishment. During there journey, Chief and Atari are separated from the others, and they bond close together after Atari gives him a bath. When they finally rejoin the rest of the group, they come across a cannibal tribe of dogs but are ambushed by Kobayashi's men. Spot arrives with an army of dogs, and they fend off the assailants together. Spot reveals that he was rescued by the tribe, and he has become their leader. He has also mated with a female, who is pregnant, so he doesn't want to leave with Atari, even though he has risked his life to rescue him. He then reveals that Chief is his brother, so he transfers his protection duties for Atari, to Chief, even though Spot still loves Atari. The people of Megasaki believe that Atari is dead, and Kobayashi plans to exterminate all of the dogs in Trash Island, so when the dogs find out what is happening from a mysterious owl, they decide to make there way back to Megasaki. Meanwhile, Tracy is given the cure from Watanabe's ex-assistant, Yoko Ono, who confirms that her suspicions are correct about the corruption in office. When Tracy confronts Kobayashi with the evidence, he dismisses all of her information, and he orders her expulsion from Japan, back to the United States. When the dogs finally arrive at Megasaki, they prove that the cure works, which puts Kobayashi to shame in front of all of his supporters. He then revokes his decree but his right-hand man, Major Domo, insists on triggering the extermination. A fight then breaks out between Kobayashi and Domo in which the execute button is pressed but the poison backfires on the captors, thanks to some help from a hacker friend of Tracy's. Now you see what I mean about the movie being over complicated! With this amount of A Class actors, it didn't really smash the box office, and with the amount of hard work that goes into this type of animation, the movie should have been much better. The critics have given it high praise, and I personally haven't heard a bad word about it but it still wasn't my cup of tea. Dog lovers will be able to relate to the film in many ways, especially the relationship between Akira and Spot but I haven't got, or ever had a dog, which explains why I didn't get it. On the plus side, I did find some of the scenes funny, especially the smoked out fight scenes and some of the narrating but I expected more from this, somewhat warped minded director, who usually produces great work. Average!\n\nRound-Up:\nThis movie was directed by Wes Anderson, who also brought you Bottle Rocket in 1996, Rushmore, the great Royal Tenebaums, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, the enjoyable Darjeeling Limited, Fantastic Mr. Fox, Moonrise Kingdom and the brilliant Grand Budapest Hotel. He's not one to release movies often, so when he's working on a project, he really does give it his all. He has directed some of my favourite movies, which is why I was really looking forward to this film but it let me down, just like the Fantastic Mr. Fox did. Although his films don't smash the box office, he has the ability to get some of the best actors in the world, due to his unique and fun style, which will stand the test of time.  \n\nBudget: N/A\nWorldwide Gross: $63million\n\nGenre: Animation, Adventure, Comedy\nCast: Bryan Cranston, Koyu Rankin, Edward Norton, Bob Balaban, Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum, Greta Gerwig, Frances McDormand, Scarlett Johansson, Harvey Keitel, F. Murray Abraham, Yoko Ono, Tilda Swinton, Ken Watanabe, Liev Schreiber, Courtney B. Vance, Anjelica Huston, and Roman Coppola. 6/10",

When this movie was nearing release, it was then that I realized that Wes Anderson is a man who likes his frames to be symmetrical. I thought it was just a stylistic choice for Fantastic Mr. Fox due to the fewer limitations of animation, however tedious stop-motion may be. Turns out I was wrong and it was present in his live-action films as well. Isle of Dogs shows that animated movies can have a rating stronger than PG without resorting to vulgar, South Park-style humour. Isle of Dogs is a charming, detailed adventure.

También todas sus películas se caracterizan en otro aspecto: todas y cada una de ellas son una obra maestra, e Isla de Perros, obviamente, no es la excepción.\nEn esta ocasión vuelve a recurrir a la animación en stop motion ya utilizada en El fantástico Sr. Zorro (2009) y nos presenta una ficticia ciudad japonesa pro-gatos en un futuro distópico donde todos los perros son enviados por el alcalde Kobayashi a una isla luego de ser declarados culpables de expandir la gripe canina a toda la población, mientras se evita que se creé una cura y así poder aniquilarlos totalmente.\nAl mismo tiempo, un joven de 12 años llamado Atari, sobrino del alcalde, viaja a la isla para buscar a su perro/guardaespaldas Spots y para eso recurrirá a la ayuda de una jauría liderada por Chief, un perro callejero al que no le caen muy bien los humanos.\nOtro aspecto característico de Wes Anderson es el elenco de estrellas, en este caso de voces, que presenta en sus películas. El cast está integrado por Bryan Cranston, Bill Murray (presente en 8 de las 9 películas del director), Edward Norton, Jeff Goldblum, Liev Schreiber, Scarlett Johansson, entre otros.\nUna curiosidad es que cada personaje, tal como se indica al principio de la película, habla su lengua materna, por lo cual cuando los personajes japoneses hablan, lo hacen en su idioma y sin subtítulos, salvo que este doblado por una interprete. Sin embargo, a pesar de ser personajes de animación, la trama y los detalles y gestos permiten entender a la perfección cada uno de los conceptos.\nSiempre es importante recalcar que el cine de Wes Anderson, al ser cine de autor, no está hecho para cualquiera y aquellos que buscan algo más de género es preferible que busquen por otro lado.",

While a quest for a boy for his dog, and the dog's loyalty to his master has many options to explore the reason for their mutual loyalty, it is strangely aloof.  The length is excessive and would have benefited from the same editing and brevity of a previous work, \"The Fantastic Mr. Fox\".  Wes Anderson also seems to have gone to the well of excess found in most of Ralph Bakshi's work, Mighty Mouse being a notable exception.  More clipping and less padding would have been very welcome.  The voice work is fine, almost gifted, but much of the dialogue  seems stilted and forced to make a point.  This is a work worth a look but doubt if it will enter my rotation of repeat viewings.",

Needless to say, I was very much in the bag for the auteur's return to stop-motion animation after the delightful excursion that was 2009's Fantastic Mr. Fox. And so, the question then surpasses that of expectation dictating the perceived outcome of a certain film, but rather to be that of if there is already this acceptance of quality due to the understanding of the passion, time, and care committed to a project then just how good is it exactly? Where does it rank among the director's already impressive catalogue? As the credits rolled on the brief feeling, but wholly satisfying Isle of Dogs it became infinitely more clear than it had a moment earlier when still in the midst of the film that while this may be Anderson's most outright imaginative take on a motion picture it is also the one that is most vague in regards to its intentions. Maybe memories of Fantastic Mr. Fox escape me or maybe I missed a thesis that Isle of Dogs states throughout its rather straightforward narrative, but what seems most likely is the fact Anderson intended this to be as simple as it could possibly be so that individual movie-goers might make of it as they please with the filmmaker himself only taking credit to the extent the experience of watching his film brought excesses of escapism and joy. There isn't a single aspect of that previous sentence I would disagree with in terms of how easy it is to be swept up in the world of Isle of Dogs and how effortlessly enjoyable the movie is, but there is no sense of real emotional investment to be conjured either. It's not a mandate that Anderson's films be emotionally involving which is to say the meaning of his movies rarely take center stage, but often times it's hard to avoid such because of the natural investment made in the compelling characters. In Isle of Dogs we have a pack of abandoned canines and a twelve year-old boy who doesn't speak English whom Anderson gives no subtitles and thus there is something of a disconnect, but despite these small quibbles (and trust me, that's all they really are) Isle of Dogs is a meticulously crafted, beautifully rendered, and pitch perfect Wes Anderson movie that positions the water cooler conversations to not be about what the film is discussing, but what the film is; not what it says, but how it makes you feel.\n\nread the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com",

            "content": "Isle of Dogs is director Wes Anderson's second venture into stop-motion animation following 2009's Fantastic Mr. Fox and from a technical standpoint it's everything you expect. The story follows a young boy by the name of Atari (Koyu Rankin) who with the help of five dogs goes in search of his long lost dog Spots (Liev Schreiber) on Trash Island. When it comes to the animation, the cinematography, and the score this movie is exceptional and I expected nothing less from one of Anderson's films. He has a very specific quirky style that he brings out in each of his stories and it's what sets him apart from a number of other directors. However as far as the story and characters are concerned I wasn't really hooked throughout this entire film. I didn't feel much of a connection to the characters and the relationships and I didn't get enough from the story to really grab me and hook me in. There are some nice story beats here and there but for the most part I just personally couldn't get into it. \n\n\n\nLets begin with the cast because the list of A-list voice talent in here is so extensive I could go on for ages listing off everyone. There are strong performances from Jeff Goldblum (Duke), Bill Murray (Boss), Edward Norton (Rex), Bryan Cranston (Chief), Scarlett Johansson (Nutmeg), and Greta Gerwig (Tracy Walker) amongst others and everyone plays their role really well. As an ensemble they're a very talented bunch and each performance compliments the next to where there isn't really a clear standout role. And I actually like that about the film, of course some of the dogs get more screen-time and development than others but overall I remembered characters as part of a group as oppose to as individuals. So in terms of the storytelling don't get me wrong, it is very easy to follow, it's well written, theres the element of this dog and owner bond that works, but I personally wasn't extremely invested in what was going on. I don't think it has to do with Anderson's style of filmmaking or the stop-motion animation genre specifically as there are a films in both of those realms that I love. It might just be a combination of things from those realms and the way the story is told that I just didn't really gravitate towards. There is heart in the story and I feel like a lot of people will respond to that especially if they have experienced a strong bond with a dog in their life. As a whole however it didn't hit for me. \n\n\n\nBut as I mentioned, from a technical standpoint this movie is exceptional. Everything is done with Wes Anderson's style in mind and it connects everything from the score to the cinematography and set-design in a fantastic way. This is always the clearest identifier to me that Wes Anderson is a phenomenal director in the way he manages to bring all of these departments together and express his unique style concurrently through all these avenues. Tristan Oliver is the cinematographer here who has worked on a number of stop-motion features including Anderson's last venture into the format, and his work is exceptional. Oliver applies his experience working on stop-motion projects and brings out that Wes Anderson quirkiness in every shot and scene transition, making the most of the format by executing things that can't be done in live action. Anderson re-teams once again with Alexandre Desplat who helms the score and it's a very playful and hard-hitting score that links with the tone of the story really well. It's such an integral part of each and every scene that it's almost impossible to ignore. \n\n\n\nSo, in the end Isle of Dogs is a film that as far as the story goes I personally didn't resonate with it as much, but on the technical side of things it's very meticulously crafted across a number of departments. Wes Anderson brings everything together and makes it all feel like a unified project with a single consistent tone evoked through the score and cinematography specifically. Fans of Anderson's work will no doubt get a lot out of this film including the story which I don't think is necessarily bad it just didn't work with me, and I know I'm in the minority there. \n\n6/10",

The stop-motion animation is exquisite and yet curiously unique, far from perfect but intentionally so, which gives the film the perfect edge to compliment its dictation of childhood adventure. As always, Mr. Anderson assembles a voice cast that perfectly characterizes his writing, translating whatever some might have considered pretentiousness into charming dictation and life.

Normally Wes Anderson's films are always full of heart and quirkiness, and his greatest works would occur when he could achieve a perfect balance between his warmhearted approach to the subject matters (even the darkest ones, some of which are heavily implied in this film) and his tendency to mark the subtlety of his film with bizarre characters, sentimental stories, and sometimes hilarious plot devices. This film leans a little bit to the quirky side, partly due to the somewhat limitation of the stop-motion format of this film in depicting human emotions, and also due Wes Anderson's over-reliance on playing with words and languages. Nevertheless, I enjoyed this film thoroughly for its amusing characters and chaotically optimistic plot, but more importantly, I admire Wes Anderson for his smart and surprisingly humanistic sarcasm while dealing with such poignant and relevant themes like racism, discrimination, public manipulation, propaganda, and desensitization of animal cruelty. A serious and frank depiction of tragedies is important, but a lighthearted caricature of the truth that can both entertain and evoke emotions from the audience is even more difficult, and sometimes more useful.",

            "content": "This canine-themed stop-motion beast wags its tail because of Anderson's filmmaking loftiness\n\nWes Anderson is not a cult artist, he's a prolific maestro. His films always enjoy an added cachet that positions them far above many only-entertainment flicks, and his latest classical animated jewel meets perfectly what one would expect from an indie author who has erected his sublime filmography frame by frame. It's neither a blatant cultural appropriation of East Asian culture nor a scurrilous Japanese stereotyped assortment drawn by an injurious foreigner, it's a beautifully hand-made and delicate love story, a widely different, a fertile pic in visible and veiled exclamations on freedom, press, politics, principles, fear, transformation, friendship and human and dog's life which feeds off from a top-of-the-range vocal cast and a visual and technical section as eccentric and neat as every of the narrative ambitions of a filmmaker who not only sets up a baroque addition to his exquisite filmography and artistic growth but imbues this high-concept film, with some complacency, of a razor-sharp, sophisticated allegory that is clearly geared to the grown-up minds, those who resist to consider art as a channel of trivial thoughts, not as a mechanism of inescapable contact and advancement. \n\nThere's no doubt that for Anderson's style newcomers the first thing they will highlight is tangibility of the pictures. Getting into the multiplex with a pre-established idea about how \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" director works is not helpful to prepare the senses, because it'd be minimizing part of their huge effort, every drop of beauty emerging from the screen is commendable, it's pure marvel. When the screening was over, the up-front reference that arose in my mind was the most recent piece of art of Laika Entertainment, \"Kubo and the Two Strings,\" not precisely by the concordance with the cultural basis or some moral similarities, but by the beautifully crafted creations, by being an invaluable gift for cinema, by the unspeakable visual prowess that hundreds of artists have built for us. The symmetrical compositions of the ever-perfectionist director who refuses to subdue his works under the phenomena of the digital age are straightforwardly glittering; a sharper aim to circumvent known superficialities and immerse it into the complicated, visually speaking, Japanese pulp places this film on a higher level in artistic terms, even unfolding the majority of the action on an adjacent island. Detail transmutes into obsession with the slightest manifestation of sumptuousness; the naturalness in its moves dazzles our perceptions which try to stumble upon a broken sequence, a malicious desire that, obviously, never will come true with Anderson at the helm. There are few human beings walking through the story because the canine leads are the ones who get most of the attention of the art departments; the dog's actions and activities enhance the progress of the plot thanks to the veracity of their behaviors, the domesticated animal par excellence is really here beyond the nearly human behavior given to them. More broadly, what decorates with personality the feast of strangely gorgeous frames is incredible and awardable cinematographer Tristan Oliver, rich in nuances and recesses endowing the pictures with irrepressible force which grows uncontrollably as the film runs, every frame is an authentic, finely crafted and shaped sculpture passing through the hands of hundreds of exquisite animators who with their talent, literally and figuratively, capture the obsessions of an animation maestro; a spellbinding experience. It's worth highlighting the majestic score by the most recent Oscar winner for Best Original Score Alexandre Desplat, who again is running for a golden nomination in the awards. Like Ludwig Göransson for Marvel Studios' \"Black Panther,\" he's a composer who knows how to channel well traditional drum sounds and Oriental instruments in which the feature film develops, he mixes them with his own ideas, creating a portentous whole, here, musical accompaniment is vital for the sensory process in the cinematic experience; his score is volatile, energetic and powerful, but at the same time fine, sensitive and adequate, candid and completely exciting.  \n\n\nAnderson isn't only known for his peculiar and unpractical but extremely gratifying filming method, the textual motives that mobilize such handmade constructions intervene in the success of the narrations. The script is written undeniable by the American director because the characteristics of a concise writer arise, sensitive in a given moment, but coolly manipulative when the film itself requires it. With regard to the dicey, well-intentioned plot, it's conceived by eight hands with own name and recognition: Kunichi Nomura, in his first work as a writer; Jason Schwartzman, in his third experience as a film screenwriter; Roman Coppola, in one of the greatest successes of his career; and Wes Anderson, a man who doesn't need a description, just run and get covered with his artistic visions. The perspective he gives the story is simply unique, social and pleasantly revitalizing not only due to the fussy field of animation but the drama genre lines it uses with an unusual confidence in levels of conviction and coherence with respect to a plot that doesn't set in an explicitly human context, in the strictest sense of the word. The spark of the script gives brilliance to the plot needs and intransigent twists, besides, comedy is handled surgically in the narrative, becoming it a crucial point on the mere fact that the gradual and unexpected humor threads compose and speed up the pace of a non-commercial film, one that does have to defend against other mega-budget opponents. The most unfocused and less determined who attend the multiplex will delight with the elements manufacturing a beautiful surface, however, the most observant and connoisseurs of the filmmaker's style will get out of the theater with a radically different perception, a sharper, more complicated and risky one that touched on polarizing and delicate current problems concerning the whole world. In addition to its frank animalistic message, the script keeps going its critical purpose in every approach it proposes, criticisms that never boss around the characters to get their tasks, but rather they boss around every spectator's intellect to try to play with what it considers to be right and wrong, ironically, expressed through a canine tale. \n\n\nGenerally speaking, Anderson delivers an editing style I have never seen before, telling his story in two languages (English and Japanese) and opposing completely to dubbing, he warns with complacency, after the unforgettable opening credits, the way how he will approach the narrative, presenting the rules of the universe he created and you have to accept to get lost in, whether you want or not. The film always gets a way to literally translate most of the foreign dialogue, however, it's here where his filmmaking method comes into play to underline that the most important characters are the animals, the Americanized canines, who capture all their attention and effort. It's also widely appreciated the work done by the incorrigible voices of post-modern American and European acting patrons and matrons- it's not really difficult to hide the disparity between men and women again. - Bryan Cranston, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Greta Gerwig,  Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton and Scarlett Johansson or important Oriental exponents such as Yoko Ono, Kunichi Nomura or young player Koyu Rankin perform a dubbing work motivated by dedication, enthusiasm and, of course, the pride of joinig forces with one of the most old-school and perfectionist directors currently working. The excellent vocal cast is undoubtedly one of the strengths and main thrusters for the organic, charismatic and dynamic functioning of the ambitious idea.\n\n\n\"Isle of Dogs\" by Wes Anderson mesmerizes from beginning to end, partly by its mania of playing with the high expectations always put on a director's job. Accessible and sophisticated, strategic and human, hilarious and dramatic, strangely beautiful and directed; this animated film is an undeniable love letter from the filmmaker to Oriental culture, canines and, beyond doubt, the recesses and perversities of the feelings, actions and inspirations of humankind; A feature film that produces juicy critical, controversial commentaries through generally opposed elements that are quickly woven on a story led by any manifestation of love, prioritizing narrative, technical and artistic fields with the proportionality only a maestro could handle. If you want to enjoy a good movie you will have many more options to choose from, but if you demand a top-notch film you will be welcome to watch as a stop-motion animation monster puts an actor, screenwriter, producer and director- uninterested in making movies for an Oscar - on the front page, a place he has never gotten out from.",

And speaking of translations, the choice to maintain the actual Japanese language in both voice and written word throughout the movie was an excellent touch in delivering an authentic experience, in fact making light humor with actual characters that are translators in the film amplifies the comedy in delivery even more so.

Hell, every Wes Anderson venture gets assigned the same dozen adjectives, including \"whimsical\" and \"fairy-tale-esque.\"  I prefer another word.  Brilliant.  Set in a dystopian Japan, where Tokyo is being governed by a pseudo-fascist mayor with a vendetta against dogs, all canines are exiled to a hellish island.  The mayor's nephew goes on a quest to find his own dog and comes across a gang of mutts with goals of their own.  Interestingly, a good chunk of the film's dialogue is in unsubtitled Japanese, as spoken by the humans.  Our canine protagonists speak English and it is quite clear from this forced perspective (at least for Western audiences) that we are to view things from their point of view.  Isle of Dogs is a stop-motion animated movie, and while one may jump for joy that we have an animated children's movie that is not Pixar-style CGI, it's hard not to draw comparisons to Fantastic Mr. Fox.  Fox was a bit deeper and bolder, but Isle ends up being more entertaining and approachable for children.  The voice cast is EXACTLY who you would pick considering who shows up for 90% of this director's filmography and they are superb.  But it's Bryan Cranston who does a lot of the heavy lifting and I would include this among his best work in the last few years.  Yeah, I said that.  Isle of Dogs is a smart and funny movie for older children and a probably a welcome relief to their parents, if they so choose to put this up on Netflix in a few months.  Oh, and play it back to back with Moonrise Kingdom.  That's still Wes Anderson's best wide release.",

Many of the issues are ones that our society is dealing with today. Racism, Immigration, Fake News, Proporganda, and the power of the youth are all present here. Wes Anderson absolutely knows that parents and teenagers do pay attention and understand these issues. Themes and issues aside, Isle of Dogs is also a pretty great film. The art direction is beautiful as is the cinimeatography too. Each shot can be bleak with grayness, then the next shot can be bursting with color and a feast to the eyes. The characters are also greatly expanded on but my only issue was the reliance on flashback scenes. It’s not a big flaw, but it did take my expeirence down a few noches. Isle of Dogs PG-13 rating also comes with plenty violence to be thrown into the mix as well. In conclusion, Isle of the Dogs is a new style of animation tackling our society’s biggest issues while still offering a action packing thrilling and colorful adventure the whole way through",

The work that went behind the stop-motion is admirable and quite finely detailed too but when it comes to draw the emotions out from the screen, it isn't utterly adequate. The writing is strong, witty and fast paced (especially in its first act) which should have come off in its favor, but due to multiple characters and their sub-plots that it has to cover in such short runtime (around 100 minutes), there is very little space for the audience to breathe in. Wes Anderson's world is definitely different than its usual features and the irony in here is that, \"this\" is a simpler and asymmetrical one . A decent job on giving the voice by the star cast to these eerie characters and so was the choice on casting them. Isle Of Dogs is an intriguing feature to encounter where the execution is genuinely effective and lures you in within few minutes making the audience work for it and sweeps away its runtime like a charm but the only thing that itches you throughout the course is the writing which unfortunately isn't as convoluted as the makers think.",

We meet our lovable band of misfit friends here, as they stumble upon a young boy who has crash-landed his plane on the island. It seems to be shaping up to be an archetypical story about a lone stray learning to work with humans.

It always felt jerky and uncomfortable.

While I'm also a huge admirer of 'Fantastic Mr. Fox', 'Isle of Dogs' actually has a greater sense of authenticity and world building mechanics and that unique quirky Wes Anderson charm that entertains audiences. At the same time the very Kurosawa-esque film feels like a foreign language film especially for it's foreign setting and use of the Japanese Language contrasting with a lot of English dialogue too, but it's very effective as I also don't think cultural contextualization and appropriation isn't antagonized or dissuaded as the setting and civilization serves the film well. Every shot is like a painting or a piece of authentic Japanese puppetry, beautifully detailed and constructed as if I'm almost watching a piece of Anime or Kabuki put together in such vivid and ecstatic composition. There's never a dull moment in this truly tremendous piece of an animated masterpiece that has to be experienced on the big screen to be believed.",

Here's what made this movie so incredible:  the cinematography was purposely innovative that the times I had to blink were inconvenient given I did not want to look away for a single second,  the plot was so heartfelt and relevant that even the most cynical viewer would be hard challenged to not be engrossed by the uplifting nuances, and finally the editing, tone, and pacing were masterfully accomplished to savant proportions of skill.  I am always pleased when my expectations as a viewer are surpassed and I expected nothing less from Wes Anderson.

            "content": "WARNING, this review would contain some spoilers:\n\nAnimation was pretty good, but the story lacked heart and the ending felt like Pitch Perfect 3's. It felt really rushed. It's as if SOMETHING had to be neatly wrapped up in the last few minutes and then it just did. Not only did the ending feel forced and awkward, the romance and the characters themselves felt that way too. You know, \"She fell in love, one teardrop\". This movie is definitely a Wes Anderson movie, and I'm saying that in a mixed way.  It's as if I've seen the movie before, but it feels like a rerun rather than a nice warm familiar feeling, like seeing an old friend. Isle of Dogs has a Wes Anderson style, which is recognizable, it's good! But it also follows the Wes Anderson format of \"deadpan character with one spunky love interest\" too closely. Unlike Fantastic Mr. Fox, the mood just did not work as well as that film did. For example, the love between Mr. and Mrs. Fox was already well established, and Ash's character worked quite well. Unique names, like Kristofferson, fit since it felt like a fun kid's movie. Unfortunately, Isle of Dogs didn't do quite do so well with that because of several reasons. It's rated PG-13 and some scenes are a bit awkward to watch with your kid. Mixing those scenes up with \"lighthearted names and exaggerations\" made the mood feel very out of place, and not in a good way. It feels as if someone wanted both \"realistic\" and \"stylized\" gesture and the figure turned out to have wrong proportions. The exaggeration also come in forms of cheap stereotypes. The Japanese characters themselves felt like they were reduced to stereotypes at times. Like for instance, the scientist's wife was named Yoko Ono, the mayor is named after the hot dog eating champion, the kid's name was named after a video game console... It's like naming someone John Lennon, Bay, and XBox, it's kinda awkward... It has the campiness but not the charm as other Wes Anderson movies had. Not to mention Kobayashi says \"Risupekuto\" a lot. It's kinda a bit like Apu's \"Thank you, come again\" catchphrase. Again, really awkward, and we need to address that. Not to mention it was very reminiscent of Logan Paul yelling \"Japan is all about respect\" while disrespecting everything about the country. While not to that caliber of Logan Paul of course, it is reminiscent and it felt like Japan was more a playground than anything. Some of the usage of the iteration marks and the kanji was wrong and plainly used for aesthetic. It's like the graphics department went to Google Translate and went \"okay that looks like a newspaper ad!\" You know, how JRPGS and Anime have really awkward English wording and something doesn't feel quite right? It's very much like that. Pretty awkward. Also... Megasaki... omg... Bluntly put, this movie felt as if Coachella was an indie film. Or more accurately a movie version of Panda Express, it's kiiinda like Asian food, there are Asians working there, but you know something feels a bit off. Japan felt like it was used as a prop. I can't even hear some of what the Japanese characters are saying because it's muffled more than the English voices. However,  the movie does provide a little bit of humor for people who can speak Japanese and does give some familiarity, such as what news anchors say when moving onto new topics. But, for the most part, Japan felt like it was used as a backdrop and very much as if it was \"wonders of the orient\" than it being an actual country with actual people. His storytelling was all over the place. Combined with the Wes Anderson style, Isle of Dogs felt as if someone locked eyes with you as they told a long story with many run-on sentences. The animation however, was pretty good, and the artistic choice of not using subtitles made it feel more wholesome, I'd admit. I also got to give props to giving the Japanese characters actual Japanese voice actors. However, most of the culture was caricatured and not handled that well and some parts needed to be handled a little better. I personally do not mean to be viewed as an attack on Wes Anderson, I think he's a very hard-working director, but there are many issues we must address in future movies to come. Technical and cultural. For that I must rate it 1 and a half stars, sorry.",

            "content": "They're good dogs.  Set in Japan in the near future, all canines get outlawed due to a strand of dog flu.  By decree of the mayor, all dogs get exiled to Trash Island, but what is to happen when the mayor's son (Koyu Rankin) stages a rescue mission so as to be reunited with his lost dog?  Now my friends never really understand this about me, but I do not consider myself to be all that big of a fan of Wes Anderson's library.  I tend to appreciate almost all of his movies, I just don't share the same rabid passion that most of his fans seem to carry for his films.  My wife, on the other hand, has been a fan since the beginning.  Either she has rubbed off on me or I've just changed my opinion since The Grand Budapest Hotel, but I was really excited for Isle of Dogs.  I did not leave the theater disappointed.  Now while this is animation, you shouldn't be fooled into thinking that this is a kid's movie.  While this is always a comedy, there are darker moments that are ever present.  These dogs have all seen better days, so they deal with fighting, missing body parts and even death, so smaller children might get disturbed by this.  Like Fantastic Mr. Fox, this is stop motion, which is a mind-boggling amount of legwork.  When combined with a director that is so obsessed with visual perfection like Wes Anderson, I can't even begin to fathom the number of man hours that went into this.  The proof is in the pudding, and the movie ends up largely succeeding on the whole.  All of the voice acting is well done from a star-studded cast, but Bryan Cranston turns in especially good work as the lead dog, Chief.  I know I wasn't all that positive about Kung Fu Panda 3, but this makes me want to see more of him in animated films.  He ends up holding the movie together, and I especially liked the relationship between him and the kid.  They also made the gutsy choice of not giving subtitles for the Japanese characters.  They wanted to stress the communication between species without fully understanding what the other is saying, and that isn't something that most movies would even dare attempt.  Even though this is an abbreviated 101 minutes, I did feel the length, and it ends up feeling about 15 minutes too long.  It's all good material that was crafted by a man who holds his creation precious and dear to him, so it is not that much of a detriment, but it still could have potentially made this movie a classic if it had some tightening up.  Isle of Dogs isn't a movie that is necessarily for everyone, but you should at the very least be able to appreciate the artistry and craft behind it.",

The ensemble cast is great, the animation works really well and the humor is enjoyable much like his other films.

            "content": "Not since I saw Joel and Ethan Coen's Hail, Caesar! have I felt so baffled by a prominent director's meticulously detailed passion project. Now, in both instances, I have almost come to resent them for it. Both films are about so many things, but drawn along their respective existential narratives they fail to evoke any sort of emotional response. The significance of their setting and characters seem both essential and pointless at the same time. However, where there at least seems to be a thesis hidden inside Hail, Caesar!'s disjunctive series of homages to golden-era Hollywood amidst black-lists and red scares, Wes Anderson's Isle of Dogs is either too simplistic a story for its rich Japanese dystopian fantasy setting or a high concept puppet show strung thin by too many stylistic diversions.\n\nThere are two main decisions that Anderson has made that I find fascinatingly off-putting. The first is that, amidst this exquisitely crafted stop-motion film, he has intercut layers upon layers of alternate forms of animation. Some of it is hand drawn or painted, some is CGI, and some of it is cut-out. All of these mediums are usually found sparingly in other features as well, but here they are jarringly, seemingly arbitrarily spliced in, sometimes tastefully and sometimes, it appears, because it would be too much hassle to do stop-motion. For instance, Atari's showdown with the robo-dogs at the sluice would have probably been a nightmare to frame, choreograph, and pose. I can look past this jarring effect by explaining away that if any filmmaker has ever had a clear cut vision of his composition it would be Anderson, and that was his intended purpose. I can certainly appreciate if he is trying to break out of his usually style of doing things, but I don't know if that's necessarily a good decision.\n\nThe other decision is that of setting it in Japan, with only occasionally translated Japanese dialogue, in homage to centuries of Japanese theater and art, then utilizing that as a fetishistic  backdrop to a completely predictable adventure plot. There's the language barrier which he dispatches with all manners of convoluted devices for basic storytelling necessity, some more absurdly frustrating than they're worth. Compounding this is Anderson's trademark twee, existential emotionality to and from his characters, that coldness that makes the whole production feel like a science fair display. In many of his films this works to the advantage, offering levity to a dark situation or a clinical edge to an otherwise emotionally uncomfortable subject. Here it just accentuates how these lifeless simulacra are going through the motions of telling a story you've heard before. You could set this movie anywhere but Japan, but you wouldn't be able to appropriate the entirety of Japanese culture for your grotesquely cute doll/dog house film.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something vital to the concept of the film, but it almost seems exploitative to set a movie in what is for all intents and purposes Fukushima when the characters simply inhabit that wasteland without engaging with it politically. Sure, the concepts of media manipulation, environmentalism, and political opportunism are woven into the framework, but something is missing in this fertile metaphoric territory. Man's best friend being relegated to an island of trash could point to any number of ideas, or nothing at all. I'm not asking for a map, but it just doesn't make a statement. What are we supposed to connect with here? The boy and his dog? The political struggle? The eccentric cast of English speaking dogs? This clash of western and eastern seems urbane yet pointless...except it's a great opportunity for Anderson to cram Kabuki, Katsushika Hokusai, samurais, Godzilla, sushi, Yasujiro Ozu, and Akira Kurosawa references into one film. It's impossible to discard the amount of care and craft that went into the visual elements of this film, but the intellectual core of the film is nebulous.",

Set in a dystopian near-future Japan, the film follows a young boy who goes in search of his dog after the whole species is banished to an island due to an illness outbreak. The film's ensemble voice cast includes Bryan Cranston, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum, Greta Gerwig, Frances McDormand, Courtney B. Vance, Fisher Stevens, Harvey Keitel, Liev Schreiber, Bob Balaban, Scarlett Johansson, Tilda Swinton, F. Murray Abraham, Frank Wood, Kunichi Nomura and Yoko Ono. (Wikipedia)\nThis film is a thing of beauty the amount of work that goes into Stop-motion is amazing. If you enjoyed Fantastic Mr. Fox or any other Wes Anderson films then you will love this as it follows the same style and humor. The story it tells is interesting and original\n. \nThis film is a must see I recommend seeing it in the theaters such as at your local Goodrich Quality Theaters. Its beauty is something to see on the big screen I have already watched it twice and it got better the second time. When it come to home video this will be a buy on 4K or blu-ray just so you can appreciate the amount of work that goes into these films and the details into how to achieve effects like a dust cloud from a fight that breaks out.",

I don't have the best of relationships with his projects, and while I enjoyed Isle Of Dogs more than his last foray into stop motion, Fantastic Mr Fox, it still didn't warm me to his methods. His side to side camera sweeps and obsessive-to-the-point-of-insanity symmetry shots may be characteristic, but it also means that every single one of his projects looks the same, and carries the same tone. The story was mostly enjoyable, as was the voice acting from the stellar cast, but it failed to connect with me because the techniques employed always felt like self-satisfied quirks rather than methods of generating emotion. To me, Mr. Anderson always seems more interested in pleasing himself than pleasing us, and as such I feel I may never come to love, or even really like, any of his past or future endeavours.",

One day, however, a small plane crash lands onto the island where a small boy is then recovered from the wreckage by the pack of dogs. The dogs adopt him as one of their pack and together they embark on a journey to look for the boy's dog, Spots. Along the way, the group uncovers a conspiracy revolving around the government and their secret agenda behind this Isle of Dogs. \nTold in classic Wes Anderson style with centralized and symmetric camera focus, the film is entertaining throughout. Anyone who loves dogs will certainly enjoy this flick and appreciate its ending as well. The music does a good job of adding tension where it's required and the fact that it's repetitive only adds fuel to the climax of the climax. Well done, Wes Anderson.",

This sci-fi-comedy-adventure touches on topics like political corruption, media, oppression, and even the Holocaust. However, the Mad-Gab-esque title (\"I Love Dogs\") really lets you know what the film's aims are. A visually captivating and heartfelt stop-motion film, it's main goal and success is as an unabashed rub-on-the-belly for man's best friend. \nSet 20 years in the future, a young boy is goes searching for his beloved pet after all of Japan's dogs have been exiled to a garbage-dump-island. Full of deadpan humor and detailed history, the world-building is fantastic. As with many of Anderson's films, it's filled with small touches (hilarious haikus, surprisingly complex dog characters) that envelope an audience despite the intentional stiffness in the delivery. And of course, there's his signature visual style. Here we're given a technical adeptness in the animation styles that makes this even more aesthetically stunning than normal, along with the extreme symmetry and dry emotions.\nFor me, Anderson's style has always been one that I could never quite embrace the way others do. Where many see it as distinct and engaging, I often find it makes his films colder and more distant than they might otherwise feel. Those feelings still popped up here for me, an undeniable sense of cloying cuteness and self-parody. However, with Isle of Dogs those negatives only serve to highlight how great the visual achievements, subtle laughs and story constructs are here. Artfully attentive and original, this may not convert audiences either for or against Anderson, but it's still a cute entry into his unmistakable repertoire.",

This fact has the weight of history behind it and the science that has made this animal the most diverse on the planet.\n      Another is that those dog lovers intentionally, unintentionally, or unwittingly personify their dogs, interweaving unique canine traits with human strengths and frailties. \n      Wes Anderson (director), a probable army of creative geniuses, and talented (voice) actors (notably Bryan Cranston and Scarlett Johansson) used these characteristics to produce a compelling fable that combined both marvelous entertainment with thoughtful social issues (such as the power of propaganda and the devotion needed to overcome it).\n      By the dog's communications being the primary viewer understanding (it is pointed out at the beginning that all dog barking has been translated into English) and most of the direct human communication being in Japanese (which the dogs - and most viewers - don't understand), Anderson craftily places the viewer among the dogs. Dog personification doesn't get any better than that.\n      Add the adroit use of adorable dog mannerisms and stop-motion animation at levels that blew my mind (\"how do they do that\" echoed in my head throughout) there is no way a dog lover can leave that movie unsatisfied.  Or is there?\n     My wife responded to my plaudits as we left the theater, \"...oh sure you loved it, you love all that weird crap\". Yes, if you're looking for a Disney style of animation and story telling you might be in for sensory overload.

Thankfully most of us are in the audience instead, which means a totally opposite, enjoyable experience.\n\nAs with all past efforts, \"Isle of Dogs\" is a staggering visual feast, and because this is animation (a stop motion, retro futuristic, Japanese one), it is chock full of exquisite canvasses, complex graphics, and stunning originality. It's easy to get caught up in the eye candy, but what is truly revelatory here is the stunning audio that envelops the theatre. Remember all that fuss about surround sound? Well, we finally have proper use, and with several instances - a fabulous drumming sequence, and a haunting dog howling - it is glorious.\n\nOh there's a story as well, which is the usual, meandering vehicle that strings together all the fun bits, and is perhaps the most traditional of Anderson's jaggedy plot lines. Plus it's full of dogs. Superb.\n\n- hipCRANK",

A young Japanese boy, Atari Kobyashi, travels to the toxic wasteland where the dogs on Uni province have been banished, to find his beloved guard dog, Spots. The story tugs at your heartstrings, but never becomes maudlin, as there are moments of laugh out loud humor. The scenery and set design are fabulous. Each of the dogs has a distinct personality and the voice actors do a fabulous job of making that happen. The film is in Japanese and English, and some, but not all, of the Japanese is either translated to, or subtitled in, English. Much of what Atari says while on the island is left untranslated, but the emotion comes through anyway. The story is of a boy and his dog with a lot of political intrigue and social commentary cleverly presented.",

They took an abandon trash Island, and made it feel beautiful and unique. Then the main city is beautiful as well, and in my view did a good job capturing the feel of a Japanese city from my personal travels. The animation alone is worth seeing, and you can tell wes anderson and the entire team put a lot of effort and passion into the set pieces and animation.\n\nshifting to the story which is the main reason, then it's a solid story. it has a unique flare of a serious story, but with a lot of dry humor and over the top moments to make it feel light heart. what makes this story works so well is the characters. for starters the boy only speaks in japanese, and without subtitles. it's a risk wes took, and it works well. same thing for many of the japanese cast members, and it gives it a more unique flair how many don't, or rarely speak english. even when they speak english, then i can catch their accent which makes it feel real from personal experience. meanwhile the dog cast is amazing. bryan cranston puts in an amazing performance, and his character has the best development. it will make sense why he has the most development when you see it.  his supporting characters including Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Jeff Goldblum, and bob balabon were amazing. they help drive the simple story of a boy finding his dog, but there is much more then that. i won't spoil it, but you'll see a well thought out story.\n\nfinally the music is amazing. the music is unique, and relies heavily on taiko drums which are amazing. Overall, it's a good film and I recommend everyone to check it out.",

The animation style here along with the production design, absolutely stunning. And the fact that this is such a mature film, rather violent at times and clearly aimed at an older audience.\n\nThe dialogue and narration really stand out in this film. The Japanese characters speaking Japanese with no subtitles provided for the audience is such a great choice. This is done because the dogs are hearing the language but don't understand, so we are listening from their perspective. It's really well-done. There's a strange subplot involving Greta Gerwig's character, however, that doesn't do much for the main story. It really drags the film down quite a bit. There are also quite a few flashbacks thrown in at the most inconvenient times, as the plot tries to move along. Those are really the main issues with this film - pacing. But it is a wonderful story, with amazing animation and music. I highly recommend it.",

How the confusion of the characters allows us as the audience to think later on how that confusion came about is excellent storytelling and narrative. Wes Anderson's ability to beautifully tell a story is why I think so many people are drawn to his movies. However, the only thing that was missing here was the dark sarcastic comedy that you expect in these movies. The visual beauty and the dark story provide a certain equilibrium for Wes Anderson films. Here Wes Anderson had some subtle darkness which the protagonists seemed to cut through with little difficulty. So while I greatly enjoyed this film, I did not find it to be perfect.",

It's the sort of animated film that comes along once every decade or so, sweeps you off your feet, completely restores your faith in the power of imagination, and leaves you wondering, \"What more could someone possibly want out of a film?\" Every frame of this visually stunning masterpiece is brimming with refreshing creativity and pure joy. Each member of its star-studded cast is utilized to perfection (Bryan Cranston, however, steals the show with his voice-over performance as Chief, the ultimate alpha-dog).  Don't make the assumption that \"Isle of Dogs\" is a kid's film just because of its outlandish premise or whacky aesthetics. Its heartwarming and infectious wit is enjoyable for moviegoers of all ages.",

            "content": "Impressive animation film that tells a great story in a witty, light hearted way. \nBefore watching this film, my impression of it was so-so. It didn't have really crazy explosive animation. The trailer was overly simple and didn't give much of a preview at all. After watching the film, I have to say this is an unforgettable film and I can watch it again next week. \nImmediately in the open, you will realized the music is extremely captivating. The Japanese big drum (tai-ko) was so much fun to watch and listen to. Picture to music is seemlessly put together. Appropriate sound track with each moment and each scene. Everything flows really well, from one to the next! Each scene, the music conveying an emotion before the dialogue. This really helps with the some of the parts that did not have a translation, because music is universal language; the thrill, darkness, loneliness, romance, dangers...etc. were exact and correct feelings that it's trying to convey. Can't wait for the original sound track in my Apple Music ! \nGreat visual, character design and development! First of all, I didn't know the style of this type of animation is called \"stop-motion animation\". Instead of drawing or illustration, they use puppets or action-figure for each second in motion, which is very impressive. The personification of each doggie, you can definitely see the social references. Chief, Rex, King, Boss, Duke are speaking in English the whole time, and they use democratic voting system formed a pact in order to survive in the abandonment island. Within the pack, Chief is the stray dog, who never has a master, of course never bathed or loved also. Therefore he is very rebellious and doesn't wanna be obedient. Rex is an indoor territorial dog with a nice life. King is popular commercial acting dog. Boss is the sportsman. Duke is high maintenance social elite. Nutmeg is the show dog/showgirl, later on has a romance with one of the pact member. The dialogue among these little creatures are fast, funny and packed with content and details. You immediately can find all these characters in our current society perhaps in ourselves as well! Director Wes Anderson and the other writers must have very in-depth knowledge of different and current social groups. Within the dialogue there are really sensitive informations and feelings, the writers use clever ways to carry these out without being offensive and degrading. I loved it! \nThe storyline or actually storylines! Yes I think there are many stories actually are happening at the same time. The complications and intricacies of writing is shocking! I think there are: 1. Political line(the mayor with cat business) 2. Hero line(Atari saving his pet) 3. Romance line(Nutmeg and Chief) 4. Camaraderie line(the pact of 5 dogs) 5. Long lost sibling line(Chief and Spots) 6. Leader follower relationship line(Atari and the dogs) 7. Conspiracy Theorist line(Tracy Walker of the student protestors). And the whole movie ended on the next generation of a new beginning! From prologue to the body, and to the end, every of storyline is entangled and intertwined with each other, scene after scene. Crossover with forward development and revealing stories one after another, pushing into a very explosive climax in part four: Atari's lantern. Okay that's it for now, I don't like spoilers. \nTempo is perfect. Most of the Japanese hybrid production normally has really good speed. There are a lot of slow vs. fast to create dynamic moments. Powerful ability in picture telling stories. Everything is calm and balanced, at the same time dynamic and dramatic. It really shows how can a few pictures tell more than thousand words. That's another reason why I think the non-translated parts were not an issue. It's fun to watch, easy to understand everything and I really enjoyed this great piece of art work!\nIn cinematography, there are a lot of balanced shot throughout the movie. The amount of balanced shots are actually at an OCD level. This is definitely a good thing for this animation film. There are a lot of content in each picture, especially the background design and illustration are so amazing. You get to sit back, relax and enjoy the story and the beauty uninterruptedly. Great way of presenting a motion picture in such way. The screen can be attractive to audience without being obnoxious or overly in your face. Parts of the film reminded me of \"Kill Bill\". The by-parts way of telling a story, music, scene style, whistling, zoom-in in the eyes with dramatic emotions. Overall it's highly artistic!\nThe social and cultural stories embedded much deeper than the animation. The gullible citizens just do what the government promotes. The government's  hidden \"kitty business\". People fight for the loved ones. Student protestor whose looking for the truth. All these are carried out by 5 cute little abandoned pets, who are the voiceless victims! It revealed a lot of stories and issues to mass audience on a witty simple level. \nI would give this movie a Solid A!",

            "content": "I had mixed feelings walking into \"Isle of Dogs\". On the plus side, I love stop-motion animation and dogs. On the minus side, I've hated just about every Wes Anderson movie I've ever seen. Reading reviews of his films introduced me to the word \"twee\"; In fact, I don't think I've ever heard it in any other context. I prepared myself for another night of listening to small groups of Andersonphiles laughing hysterically at intentionally \"random\" stuff in the background of scenes. I chose my show time to avoid crowds, sat way up front to provide a buffer, and steeled myself for the impending onslaught of hipster whimsy. \n\nI'll cut to the chase. I liked the movie. I loved some scenes and endured others, but overall it was a pleasant surprise, far exceeding my admittedly low expectations.\n\nAs one might expect, there are a lot of dogs. We're told the dogs are barking like normal dogs but that their barks are conveniently translated into English. They aren't wise-cracking dogs like those in kids' movies and they aren't dogs-in-name-only like Brian on \"Family Guy\", but rather they're dogs who act like dogs but have human-like personalities.\n \nThe plot involves dogs being banished to a place called \"Trash Island\", purportedly because a dog flu is spreading through a large Japanese city, but also because the evil mayor's family has been nursing a dog-hating grudge for centuries. The first dog to be sent away is Spots, the guard dog of Atari, a 12-year-old orphan who's the mayor's ward. It seems strange that the mayor would give Atari a dog in the first place if he so hates dogs, but most of the details of this film are best not thought about.\n\nAnyway, six months after Spots gets sent away, Atari manages to steal a small plane and fly it to the island, where he crash lands. There he meets a pack of five dogs (voiced by famous human actors who I don't feel like listing), and upon showing them a picture of Spots, they agree to help search for him. \n\nI forgot to mention that the movie is set twenty years in the future, which mostly manifests itself in the form of enhanced weaponry and vicious robot dogs that are sent to retrieve Atari. The fight scenes are boring and stupid, except for the big gray ball of cotton fluff with dog appendages jutting out at various angles which is used to depict the melees, and that is only amusing the first time. \n\nWhile the dog pack and Atari search for Spots, there's also stuff going on on the mainland. A scientist and his assistant search for a cure for dog flu while a young foreign exchange student with a blonde afro heads up a pro-dog movement\n. \nPretty much everything on the mainland feels unnecessarily complicated and confusing and not even worth trying to make sense of, though it's sometimes visually interesting. By contrast, the stuff involving Atari and the dogs is funny and charming and occasionally even touching. If only Anderson could just keep things simple and stop trying so hard to impress.\n \nFor me, the good far outweighed the barely tolerable with my love of dogs tipping the scales in the movie's favor. Two opposable thumbs up.",

            "content": "Isle of Dogs confirms that in animation form, Wes Anderson can truly let his quirky sensibilities cut loose. His latest film is bursting with brilliant sight gags and tangible animation. Each frame is packed with detail and the film absorbs you right into its world. And while the animation and the director's witty humor, which is at peak power here, are both great, the story here is also powerful in ways I wasn't expecting. Politically fueled, the narrative concerns a young Japanese boy and his search on a trash island with hundreds of dog exiles, and what could have been a simple charmer, is actually a biting satire of the follies of leadership from those not fit to be in power. All of this is told with a light, albeit scolding finger wag, and Anderson makes sure the delightful characters and charm come through most. What results, if one can see past some questionable cultural adaptation, is a joyous and bittersweet adventure that highlights man's best friend. If the story wraps up too briskly, the film's images will be floating around the mind for a while. Already a strong contender for Animated Feature at the Oscars. Rating: 86",

It also has the right mix of humor & heart, as their are plenty of eccentric jokes but also a great story about a boy who loves his dog.

Their solution to the problem is to send all dogs to Trash Island where they can scavenge for themselves. A little boy from Japan named Atari, the mayor’s son, flies over to the island to look for his dog, Spots, and a group of dogs journey in help to find him. So this movie had a limited release I think about a month ago. It was given a lot of praise and buzz so last week there was a little bit of a wider release. This week it finally got a wide release. This movie was great! Unique and original. All of the voice actor were amazing. It’s almost like the characters they had were a reflection of themselves. The stand out for me were Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum, Edward Norton, Bryan Cranston, and finally Koyu Rankin as Atari. I like Wes Anderson’s idea for stop motion. This is his second stop motion movie, Fantastic Mr. Fox being his first. Alexandre Desplat creates a great score, like he always does. The only flaws I had were that there was a side plot with one character that wasn’t necessary, but I still liked it. Some scenes dragged on just a little too. Other than that I thought Isle of Dogs was a great movie and people should go see it, as our theatre only sold 5 tickets altogether last night. My Grade: A-",

            "content": "\"Isle of Dogs\" reminds me of a mountain of rich chocolate ice cream: it's tantalizing to look at and you can't wait to dive in, but after you get two thirds of the way through, brain freeze and the overwhelming sweetness cause you to push the dish away. The cloying saccharine feeling comes in the form of the film's script, a disappointing case of too many cooks in the kitchen (with four \"story by\" credits, including director / screenwriter Wes Anderson, Roman Coppola, Jason Schwartzman, and Kunichi Nomura), but the cherry on top is Anderson's signature meticulous visual organization and balanced, proportional order that won't disappoint his longtime fans.\n\nThis beautiful looking film is absolutely pitch perfect in the classic Anderson style, brimming with a symmetrical, colorful, indie hipster aesthetic. Everything here is astonishingly stunning to look at, from the charming stop-motion animation jerk of a dog's strut to brief forays into chromatic-hued, hand drawn sketches to a character's perfectly lopsided freckles. This movie is not only stunning, it's the best looking film since last year's \"Blade Runner 2049\" (although in a completely different, winsomely twee way).\n\nComplementing the knockout visuals is a charming story about a young boy's undying devotion for his dog and a dog's everlasting loyalty to his master. It's a real love letter to our four-legged friends and may bring tears to the eyes of anyone who has ever lived with a companion animal.\n\nThe film is set in Japan with a large amount of dialogue spoken in the native tongue (the barks from the dogs, a title card teases, have been translated into English). After an outbreak of canine flu leads to all dogs being quarantined on Trash Island, a heroic young boy named Atari (Koyu Rankin) commandeers a plane and crash lands on the island to rescue his dog Spots (Liev Schreiber). Atari seeks help from a pack of exiled canines including Boss (Bill Murray), Duke (Jeff Goldblum), Rex (Edward Norton), and Chief (Bryan Cranston). As the gang of misfits traverse the landscape and news of their adventure reaches the mainland, they inspire a group of pro-dog student activists to help uncover and expose an evil government conspiracy.\n\nThe voice talent is tremendous and no one, not even Murray or Frances McDormand as a narrator called Interpreter Nelson, feels like a case of stunt casting. Cranston again shows there's nothing he can't do well, lending a stark and poignant empathy as the voice of Chief. Harvey Keitel, as penitent, remorseful dog Gondo who is forced to turn into something horrific as an act of mercy, is another surprising standout in a crowded cast of accomplished performers. (The time to remind parents that this is not a film for the kiddos is now). The only real acting misstep comes from Greta Gerwig's robotic and stiff turn as unlikely exchange student turned revolutionary Tracy, a small yet meaningful character who could've (and should've) been so much more.\n\nAnderson's detail oriented direction often makes me unconditionally giddy and this time around is no exception. Every little clothes button and curly hair and old timey microphone is so reverently and affectionately placed that you'd have to watch this film at least a dozen times to fully appreciate the utmost care and meticulous precision that is on display. This works tenfold when it comes to the visual creativity, but it also is something that hurts the film's narrative.\n\nThe screenplay feels like it was diagrammed and workshopped to death, rigid and tense, planned out and so carefully plotted to the point that it loses all of its thunder. The social commentary sadly becomes tiresome, and the witty cleverness is drowned out by the oft-putting smugness and pretension. The only thing that's truly disappointing about \"Isle of Dogs\" is the long-winded script.\n\nWhile it may not be one of Anderson's very best works, it's still a brilliant, charismatic, beautiful looking movie. The stop-motion on display here is an achievement of the highest order, and anyone who adores animation as an art form should flock to this film.",

Watching Atari and the dogs stumble through trash island is intriguing as you never know what is going to be around the corner. There are small twists in the story which will keep you captivated, and just in general, the story is winsome and compelling for all ages; who knew the idea of combining political conspiracy with man's best friend could work so well?

His style is bizarre, boring and hard to follow with an aimless plot at best. As with all his films, his stories appear to be told by a director who can’t decide if he’s a boy or man. It should be noted that only 4 of the 11 top billed cast were females who had extremely limited story lines. Academy Award Actress Frances McDormand was reduced to 3 sentence news announcements that were sprinkled throughout this sh$t show. Ain’t that a bitch? Have fun with your sausage fest, Wes. ",

            "content": "The quirky imagination of Wes Anderson and his stylized, symmetrical, painterly approach to filmmaking has always seemed like a natural fit for the world of animation. Stop-motion has a wonderfully tactile and woebegone appreciation that furthermore seems like a natural fit, and 2009's Fantastic Mr. Fox is one of Anderson's best and most enjoyable films. If it were not for the considerable time it takes to make animated films, I'd be happy if Anderson stayed in this realm. Isle of Dogs is about a future where dogs are blamed for an infectious disease and as a result are banned and quarantined to a garbage island off the coast of Japan. One little boy dares to venture to this island to find his beloved missing dog. From there, he's escorted by a pack of dogs, led by Chief (voiced by Bryan Cranston), across dangerous tracks of the island while avoiding the boy's adopted family, the mayor of Nagasaki. This is a whimsical, beguiling, detail-rich world to absorb, but it also has splashes of unexpected darkness and violence to jolt (though the dark turns are consistently nullified). It's a highly entertaining movie although the characters and story are rather thin. The different dogs are kept as stock roles, and the main boy, Atari, is pretty much a cipher for dog owners. However, the film can tap into an elemental emotional response when discussing the relationship between man and dog. If you're a dog person, it's hard not to feel a twinge of emotions when a dog is given a loving owner and sense of family. There is one element of the movie that feels notably off, and that's the fact that the dogs speak English and the local Japanese characters speak their native tongue but without the aid of subtitles. it doesn't exactly feel like Anderson is doing this as a source of humor, but I can't figure out a good alternative reason for it. I'm sure Cranston's distinctive growl would have sounded just as good speaking Japanese. Regardless, Isle of Dogs is a mid-pack Wes Anderson fantasia of inventive imagination and well worth getting lost within.\n\nNate's Grade: B",

            "content": "After his first successful outing with 2009's Fantastic Mr Fox, director Wes Anderson returns to animation with Isle of Dogs, a delightfully unusual affair accentuated by its textural design and dry wit. I enjoyed Isle of Dogs thoroughly; Anderson's film is intelligent, profound and above all unique, sufficing as a very entertaining film, if only for those open-minded to the director's quirkiness. \nThe film find its primary strength in its visuals and animation design; the stop-motion animation lends itself perfectly to the film's odd and often ghoulish imagery (as expected of Anderson, symmetry and prolonged facial close-ups are ubiquitous). Everything from character design to camera angling perfectly combines to create a movie which is beautifully shot and admirably detailed. \nThe plot itself is charming, using its dystopian setting of a Japan where dogs have been banished to a trash island to prevent the spread of dog flu to create a sweet story of young Atari who travels to the so-called Isle of Dogs to find his lost dog Spots (voiced with gravitas by Liev Schreiber). Merged into this tale, however is a political thriller, charting the corruption of the Kobayashi government and their sinister methods to be re-elected and eliminate canine life from the archipelago once and for all. Whilst I appreciate Anderson's detail and maturity in approach to what could have been a simple film, I found the scenes with Atari and the dogs on the island far more interesting; slowly but surely the film becomes more about the politics than the pooches and the film does slightly suffer from it. The film rambles to a weak and frankly dull climax, which is a shame as there are some golden scenes in the film, which showcase charming and witty writing and execution. The A-list cast are mostly wasted in small roles, but Bryan Cranston and Edward Norton give fledged and masterful performances, with Cranston managing to emanate profound humanity even through his canine mouthpiece. The majority of the human cast speak in Japanese, with Frances McDormand dubbing over in her role as Interpreter Nelson. Much of the Japanese dialogue is completely untranslated; Anderson was adamant that the audience feel the emotion coming through the characters and they did not need to speak English to do that. Whilst this is a nice idea and adds something to the authenticity of the film, it is something of a hindrance and certainly doesn't make the parts of the story away from the Isle of Dogs any more enjoyable; perhaps some subtitles would suffice, Wes!\nOverall, Isle of Dogs is a confident and boldly different effort by Wes Anderson, whose style, while indisputably odd, creates some moments of sheer cinematic majesty and delight for the audience. The film may not be one of his masterpieces, but Isle of Dogs remains a largely enjoyable and creative movie that can be appreciated solely for its flair",

            "content": "With a stacked cast of several talented actors, Isle of Dogs delivers a unique blend of quirkiness and wit seldom seen in most modern films. The juxtaposition of both the English spoken by the dogs (And some bilingual characters) and the Japanese spoken by most of the human characters, along with the occasional subtitles, help the viewer appreciate and understand the life and culture of the people of Japan. The true brilliance of Isle of Dogs is seen during the many fast paced scenes of the story's progression. Since the film is marketed to an American/European audience, it is assumed that the average viewer does not speak Japanese. Therefore, many plot points become a matter of show, don't tell, as the characters shown speak to each other (and therefore the audience) in Japanese without subtitles. This is done deliberately, so that the viewer understands the story based on the character's actions, rather than through dialogue. Much of the humor comes from the dogs themselves, with excellent performances from Edward Norton, Bryan Cranston, Jeff Goldblum, and Liev Schreiber in particular. There are no hysterical, fall-out-of-your-seat moments or one-liners that everyone will repeat for days on end. Instead, the vastly deadpan style humor is fast paced to accommodate the quick nature of the story progression, with ironic quips, cleverly written dog jokes, and subtle jabs at Japanese culture. The stop-motion animation style is done remarkably well, and lends itself to the film's unique aesthetic. Each sequence is shot and edited smoothly, with no discernable lag or stuttering whatsoever. Those who enjoy the Rankin-Bass stop-motion films from the 1960s and 70s will appreciate the style of animation, of which director Wes Anderson has said were the inspiration, in addition to the filmography of the legendary Akira Kurosawa. While Isle of Dogs will most likely fall under the radar due to the competition from much larger scale Spring flicks, it easily cements itself as one of the best films of 2018, with an amazing cast, fluid and unique animation style, wit and dry humor, and enjoyable quirkiness. This is a one-of-a-kind movie that cannot be missed.",

            "content": "(Quick Disclaimer: Saw an\"early\" screening locally for the film at my AMC theater ahead of the films major release in other theaters on April 6th) As a hit or miss fan of Wes Anderson, one thing i cannot deny about his filmography is both his quirky and super on point executed writing and his knack for attention to framing and directing. When he's overboard with it, it still manages to be a fun ride, when it isn't it's still a fun ride; Basically, there's always something you can get out of his films whether you like him or not. And that's no different with Isle of Dogs, another practical stop animation film by the same team behind Fantastic Mr. Fox (which is actually one of my favourite 'growing up' films and absolutely get a lot of inspiration from) and completely written and directed by Wes himself. And after waiting patiently for it to come out (because honestly I was immediately hooked to the film by the marketing and first clip shown), I can proudly say a lot of my waiting was well worth the wait, because Isle of Dogs is both another home run for Wes Anderson and somehow manages to be on the same quality (and be almost a bit better) than Fantastic Mr Fox.\n\nNow with that said that doesn't mean there are issues with the film, for example the writing while does compliment the must be emphasized fantastic cast and story and structurally wise its well done unfortunately some of the character dialogue (especially in the beginning) gets a bit too on the nose and painfully forced and often has a bit of Wes Anderson's annoying uses of 'quirky' jokes that get used too repetitively and also suffers from not being able to flesh out a lot of its characters fully, these are all only can hurt the film slightly. But other than that, a great and energetic cast (both from the dogs playing off each other and japanese humans who are really well structured and written) that do such a good job in their respective roles, the surprisingly really engaging story that sure doesn't do a lot of in terms of twists and conflict but more than makes up for that in personality and a good character driven narrative, a wonderfully authentic soundtrack that I'm so glad Wes Anderson made sure to be as distinct and memorable as possible and composer Alexandre Desplat for just absolutely nailing out of the park composing the melodies and motifs, wonderfully quirky humour that adds a lot of personality to the film and its characters, the really refreshingly interesting dystopian world building that really sets this apart of most films Wes Anderson has done before that adds a lot of personality to the filmmaking craft,  and of course worth mentioning the incredibly animation that Wes Anderson and his team must be appreciated for putting so much attention to detail with even with scenes going on in the background.\n\nSo in case the point wasn't hammered in enough, definitely go and see Isle of Dogs. I was absolutely floored and delightfully happy to walk out of the film loving it, and is deserving of a lot of rewatches. Great job Wes Anderson, here's hoping for a Oscar nod next year and really hope you're able to keep hitting from here on out.",

Set in a futuristic Japan, the dog-hating Mayor of Megasaki City decrees that all dogs are to be exiled to Trash Island as a result of Dog Flu and it is up to the Mayor's ward, 12-year-old Atari, and a bunch of young activists to save the canine population from total annihilation even after a cure was found but suppressed. A bold and perhaps idiosyncratic move is to have the humans speak in their native tongue (i.e. Japanese), and translated organically only when available, while the dogs' barking are dubbed into English. Anderson regulars (Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum, Edward Norton) as well as newbies (Bryan Cranston, Scarlett Johansson) lend their voices to the fluffy band of four-legged reprobates but the true star here is of course, Anderson, who dreamt up such an incredibly imaginative original story and tells it in a mischievous and unmistakably Andersonian manner, with stunning visuals that are meticulously rendered in great details, where every frame is as gloriously sumptuous as it is dryly funny. Some of the Japanese characterizations may border on stereotypes and the story unravels a little towards the end, leaning a bit too much into the fantastical and perhaps twee side, but it only diminishes marginally my enjoyment of this exquisite film in which people in power conspiring to commit election fraud via lies and propaganda is ultimately defeated by both science and a group of compassionate and energetic younger people galvanized to do what is necessary to overcome a tyrannical authority and reunite us with our best (canine) friends.",

A character randomly decides she's in love with another without any semblance of this aside from a swoon seconds prio to her declaration. I couldn't even appreciate the Japan aesthetic because it was Wes Anderson's vaguely racist perception of the culture rather than a direct unadulterated translation.\n\nThe film's plot unfolded in such a way that it felt as though it was being written as the movie progressed. This also left me with the irritating sensation of having my hand mercilessly and patronizingly held throughout the experience.\n\nIts only redeeming feature is the vastly more compelling music, which coupled with the painstaking animation style is very likely what seems to have pulled the wool over many a critic's eye.\n\nIf I could give it a rating, it would receive the lowest possible.",

Again, not necessarily a bad thing, but it's definitely not as light-hearted as other Wes Anderson films.

A boy (voice of Koyu Rankin) journeys there to rescue his dog Spots (Liev Schreiber), and gets help from a pack of misfit canines who have also been exiled. His quest inspires a group of dog lovers to expose a government conspiracy. The voice cast also includes Bryan Cranston, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Scarlett Johansson, Tilda Swinton, Bob Balaban, Greta Gerwig, and Yoko Ono.\n\nI had been meaning to watch this film for a long time, but it was in limited release for a while and it seemed like the wide release kept getting pushed back. Granted, I didn't look into it so I have no idea what the circumstances were or if I'm just dumb but either way, I was able to finally watch \"Isle of Dogs\". And to no surprise, I had so much fun with this film! It was an experience I'm glad I had and with no further ado, let's get into this. \n\n\"Isle of Dogs\" is a beautifully animated, stop-motion piece that looks stunning. If anything else, I highly recommend watching this film because it is beautiful and the process behind making this film was so fascinating. It was awesome to be able to see this props come to life and just how much detail was put into each one. There was so much attention to detail in every shot and every little aspect that it just left me in awe. I give a lot of credit to Wes Anderson and the entire crew that was able to make this happen. They did an amazing job and they spent a lot of time trying to create something that they'd be proud of. \n\nThis film is hilariously dark, emotional, and even funny. It was a combination of all these different elements that came together so well. I didn't really have any expectations but the trailer doesn't do this film justice. Story wise, there were so many different things that drove this film. There were a lot of big elements accompanied by smaller things that made the entire thing what it is. I thought the story was really simple and clear, yet there was so much depth behind it. I think that everything came together exactly how it needed to and I thought the overall execution of the story was great.\n\nIn all honesty though, I don't have a lot of gripes about this film. I may be rushing this review because I'm about to go see \"Avengers: Infinity War\", but \"Isle of Dogs\" was certainly one of my favorites of the year so far. I highly recommend seeing it if there's a theater near you and one things for certain, Isle of Dogs. Say it out loud if you don't get it.",

            "content": "March 23, 2018\n\nThe more I think about \"Isle of Dogs,\" the more I like it, and the more I want to see it again. There's just something about this film's tone, dry humor and visual beauty that make it uncommonly soothing, especially for an animated film. Granted, it's stop-motion animation, versus the predominant 3D computer-animated kind, so perhaps the long, slow process it took to make it contributed to its tranquility, but whatever the case, in an era when so many movies, animated or not, feel the need to throw so much action and effects on the screen all at once, here is a film that takes a quieter, more patient and calming approach. As you sit back and admire it, it simultaneously puts you at ease.\n\nIn addition to its format and style, perhaps another reason \"Isle of Dogs\" is so reposing is because there's nothing terribly complicated its story. When I first saw the trailer, I didn't know what to make of it. Is it meant to be a comedy, a drama, a family picture, a social commentary, all of the above? After seeing it, I'm still not sure to what genre it officially belongs, but after thinking about it for a while, I figured director Wes Anderson and his team probably weren't trying to make a bold political statement or argue a certain point of view with regard to the plot. Sure, the film has moderate ties to real-world news and history, but these ultimately only serve as a backdrop to a simple yet effective story about companionship and loyalty, and because I didn't think the filmmakers were pushing a more important agenda, I didn't go seeking one. I simply let the film relax me. It may not be intellectually stimulating, but you'll nonetheless leave the theater feeling joyful and content.\n\nThe setup is rather straightforward: Twenty years into the future, Mayor Kobayashi (voice of Kunichi Nomura) of the fictional Japanese city of Megasaki, bans all dogs to Trash Island, citing the unwanted spread of an outbreak known as \"dog flu.\" Despite what he tells the press, Kobayashi's motivations for such a decree extend beyond his fear the virus will soon \"enter the human disease pool.\" His bias against dogs actually dates back to feudal Japan, \"before the age of obedience,\" when the cat-loving Kobayashi dynasty fought battles to prevent dogs from continuing to roam free around the earth.\n\nNow, amidst the recent epidemic, he has an excuse to deport dogs completely, starting with his nephew Atari's faithful companion and bodyguard, Spots (Liev Schreiber). On the rubbish-filled colony, Spots and his canine brethren are forced to survive on garbage as the flu and \"snout fever\" trigger symptoms such as moodiness, narcolepsy, acute sneezing, color changes and fur loss. When Kobayashi refuses to listen to Professor Watanabe (Akiro Ito), who insists a cure is imminent, 12-year-old Atari (Koyu Rankin) steals a plane and flies to Trash Island in hopes of finding his best friend.\n\nAfter crashing landing, he meets the story's main pack of characters, a group of mostly mellow yet burned out alpha dogs who decide to take Atari under their wing and help him on his mission, not least because it would remind them of what life used to be like and the important role dogs used to play in humans' lives. The diverse group includes the irascible and scarred Chief (Bryan Cranston); the master-longing Rex (Edward Norton); King (Bob Balaban); Boss (Billy Murray); and Duke (Jeff Goldblum). Because of his rough history, Chief is hesitant to befriend any human but is encouraged to show his gentler side by Nutmeg (Scarlett Johansson), a purebred show dog who's every bit as graceful and limber and she is classy.\n\nOther members of the all-star cast include Tilda Swinton as an owl-eyed pug and Harvey Keitel as a supposedly cannibalistic half-breed, along with Greta Gerwig, Yoko Ono and Frances McDormand as some of the film's other human characters. McDormand particularly stands out as an English interpreter who delivers the play-by-play of Megasaki's mayoral election, the outcome of which could seal the fate of all dogs going forward.\n\nAnderson's screenplay, from a story by Anderson, Roman Coppola, Jason Schwartzman and Kunichi Nomura, uses its light setup and colorful characters mostly to express affection and compassion toward any creatures (including humans) who may be shunned for reasons outside their control, as well as to highlight the importance of pets, family and loyalty, and to showcase beauteous imagery. And even though it's obvious they're present, it merely plays with the ideas of authoritarianism, dictatorship, prejudice, segregation, government corruption and moral rectitude; it doesn't exactly analyze them. If Anderson ever wanted to make a more politically charged film, I'm confident a storyteller of his caliber and style would really dissect the given themes and examine their complexity, making the narrative that much more biting.\n\nBut with \"Isle of Dogs,\" I'm pretty sure he just wants to engage us with charming dogs, deadpan humor, and, above all, sharp, picturesque imagery. Tristan Oliver's cinematography, with its heavy hues such as red, yellow and orange, which fill the background of Trash Island, combined with Andy Gent's exquisite, meticulously crafted models and puppets (of which there were over 500) make the film almost tangible and it inundates us like a vivid dream. We lose ourselves so much in the pacifying frames that the story becomes secondary, and while I do think the film's hesitancy to take narrative risks and make bolder, more polemical statements about its political and social themes prevents it from reaching greater cinematic heights, it still wonderfully utilizes the basest qualities of the medium, namely visuals, to lull us and take us away. It's in our best interest to simply let it.",

The mayor of that city has ordered all dogs to be sent to a nearby island filled with trash to live out the rest of their lives.\n\tBut one boy can't stand losing his doggie friend - Atari.  He takes a plane and flies off to the island (at twelve years old? Really?)  Once on the island, he teams up with the Duke and his buddies to find Spot (that's the name of Atari's dog).\n\tBut it's not an easy task because other dogs and a robotic police unit get in the way  And there's something odd going on with the city's mayor that troubles several citizens of that city.\n\nSCORING\nMain Characters\n\tAtari's great as the innocent kid who just wants his dog back.  And a few of the dogs have good chemistry with Atari.  But the four dogs could've been cut down to two and it would've been just as engrossing.  SCORE: 7\n\nSupporting Cast\n\tThe ladies are not well represented in this movie.  Most of them are just interesting in following the guys (or falling in love with them.) This is especially true for the female dogs that get exiled to Trash Island.  SCORE: 5\n\nPlot\n\tThe events that Atari and his newfound dogs friends go through on the island are interesting - and it has a good buildup to a thrilling climax.  \n\tBut there's a huge language barrier here.  Atari only speaks Japanese, the dogs and some humans only speak English and some animals don't speak any words.  This can make the dialogue tough to follow. SCORE: 6\n\nOriginality\n\tThis could've been your average kid and a pet film, but Atari and the main cast really put a nice spin on it.  SCORE: 8\n\nViolence Factor\n\tThere's a lot of ludicrous cartoon style fighting - the dogs rush into each other and a huge cloud covers up the fight.  And there's no real injures from any of these fights.\n\tBut Atari gets the worst of everything.  He gets badly hurt when he crashes his plane on Trash Island (which is why twelve year olds don't fly.) \n\tAnd there's an operating scene that's not for the squeamish or the youngest viewers, but it was needed.  SCORE: 8\n\nOther Moral Issues\n\tThis film is about how differing sides can come together to face off against a common enemy.  \n\tBut there's a trio of love stories that felt like they were not needed.  SCORE: 7\n\nFinal Score (out of 60): 41\t\t% Score: 68.33%\n\tAn interesting film - but it would've been more enjoyable without the clashing languages and some of the sub plot lines.",

Out of all the nominees, I would like to see this movie take the prize despite the fact that it is not perfect, but I think it is safe to say that \"Incredibles 2\" will take the Oscar though \"Isle of Dogs\" is a much better movie.  Wes Anderson's second stop montion animated movie is a dramatic improvement over the extremely dull \"The Fantastic Mr. Fox\".  It has a much better story with a well written script and some very compelling and interesting characters.  The voice cast does a terrific job in my opinion and the movie is beautifully animated.  In fact, much better than \"The Fantastic Mr. Fox\".  However the movie is not without its problems.  The captioning is very small, so small in fact that I had to sit close to the television in order to be able to read it.  Also, I had to pause the DVD I was watching in order to read most of the captions because they are on screen for a very short time.  Also, I had trouble believing that Atari (That name brings back memories.) can survive for as long as he did with a piece of metal lodges in his skull.  That being said I think \"Isle of Dogs\" works very well and I am keeping my fingers crossed it wins the big prize.",

            "content": "ISLE OF DOGS 3/31/18\n\nAnyone who knows me well is aware of my complicated feelings toward dogs. Due to irrational fear, I like to observe them from a distance...I like them better when I am comfortable in their presence and they do not bark or jump on me...I like them best when they are sweet and quiet and most of all when there is a movie screen between us. In Wes Anderson's new animated film, situated in a futuristic Japan, titled ISLE OF DOGS there are images that delighted me; patterns of color and shapes that filled the darkened theater with a playful ambiance. The dialogue is witty - humor is both visual and aural which is why I revere the eccentric director, Wes Anderson who treats his dramatic personae (be they animals or humans) with a caress of gentleness endowing them with compassion, rebellion, ferocity and affection, laced with a dollop of irony. Wisdom is never absent in his films - kooky, crazy wild truths.\n\nDog vs cat enthusiasts are pitted against each other with the leading political authorities being cat proponents. Canine cleansing is the final solution to a contagion of dog \"snout\" disease that has become rampant in Megasaki City and all-powerful Mayor Kobayashi has decreed the forcible exile of hundreds of thousands of dogs to a remote place - Trash Island - a place filled with garbage and scurrying rats. There is some political opposition to the corruption of the ruling autocracy but it is barely a whimper.\n\nWe meet the hero - the intrepid Atari, who due to the death of his parents becomes the 12-year-old \"ward\" of the Mayor (a politically cynical, ennobling move) and is given a dog, SPOT to protect the young lad and be his companion. Sadly Spot is the first dog to be carted off to Trash Island and Atari is hell-bent on finding his loving friend. He hi-jacks a plane which sputters and crashes into the wasteland of filth and muck - the detritus of human civilization - where painfully skinny dogs roam about and survival of the fittest is literally the only means of existence.\n\nISLE OF DOGS is the magically heroic tale of the search for a lost and adored partner.  During the pursuit, Atari who often rails in Japanese (no subtitles -  but we get the idea ) teams up with the Alpha dogs on the Island - each having his/her own back-story; one being an ex-show dog; a house pet; another successful in advertising doggie food, and most importantly the powerful stray, Chief (voiced by Bryan Cranston) who has never trusted the fickleness of people-masters, bitterly independent as well as being the most ferocious fighter of the bunch. Imagine dogs with the peculiarity of biped's personalities, infused with charming dialogue filled with teasing jabs and dulcet flirtations. ISLE OF DOGS  creates an enchanting adventure, which is both stunning and daunting.Through surrogates, we see the nature of power and the absolute degradation of the spirit when faced with starvation, weakness, and disorder.\n\nThere are many subplots in the movie that occur in Megasaki City - but none held my interest in the way the events on Trash Island did. Communities (packs of dogs) are created in the direst of circumstances - alliances are forged and trust is built with courage as a  prime motivator for survival - a morality fable for our time.",

There are some good jokes from the pack of dogs but to be honest you see most of those in the trailer anyway. And the obvious social commentary makes you want to roll your eyes. Parading them in your film in an atypical way doesn't suddenly make it a masterpiece. And to be honest the whole message seems a bit skewed by the fact that the resolution of the movie is for the ostracised dogs to return to owners who it seems didn't care much for them in the first place and to once again become their obedient pets. I don't think this film ever really knew what exactly it was doing and it shows, especially during the ultra quick and messy end act. Wry jokes and witty quips only get you so far.

Isle of Dogs was also surprisingly thrilling, the themes of scandal and mystery are beyond intriguing.

And, of course, Isle of Dogs, as any Wes Anderson movie, has what distinguishes it from any other Wes Anderson movie. In fact, there are three new pluses here. First, and foremost, the visually storytelling. Yes, I know it's not a new thing to say about a Wes Anderson movie, but there is no Wes Anderson movie, nor any stop-motion animated movie that has used its visuals to tell its story in this way. Specially, when you know that this movie has many scenes where there is no dialogue in English, just in Japanese, or where there are just Japanese subtitles!\n\nThe second great thing about Isle of Dogs is the voice cast. Sorry Fantastic Mr. Fox, I love you even more, but here the cast really adds up to the movie. The cast isn't star-studded just because it's a Wes Anderson movie, but every single actor, or actress, really made every character feels distinctive. Bryan Cranston, who voices Chief, is easily the best. His vocal performance here is undeniably one of the best in any animated movie from the last, say, five years. But really all the cast shines in this movie. Edward Norton is my second favorite.\n\nAt last but not least, comes the music score from the Oscar winner, Alexandre Desplat. It has some Western touch in it, along with a traditional Japanese music. What a wonderful soundtrack! It really sticks in my mind long after watching the movie!.\n\nAs I mentioned above, I prefer Fantastic Mr. Fox to Isle of Dogs. That's because Isle of Dogs, unlike any other Wes Anderson movie, is convoluted for its own good. That didn't hurt the movie as whole, except at the third act, which is quite rushed and messy. Also, I wanted the character of Atari to feel more life-like person. Because I felt he was overshadowed by the dogs. Nevertheless, Atari is a well-developed character.\n\nIsle of Dogs may didn't live up to my expectations, but still it is my favorite animated movie of 2018 so far!\n\n(8/10)",

            "content": "In preparation for the screening of Isle of Dogs, I wanted to watch Wes Anderson's other stop motion film, Fantastic Mr. Fox. I had never seen it before but it had been recommended to me to watch before going to see Isle of Dogs. Fantastic Mr. Fox is a great movie and it really did prepare me for the style, the stop motion and the stories that Wes Anderson tells. Isle of Dogs did not disappoint on any of those.\n\nThe stop motion animation is the selling point for this movie as it is potentially the best stop motion animation we have seen on the big screen to date. There was times in the movie that I completely forgot I was watching stop motion, and assumed it was normal 3D or traditional animation. That is a complete disservice to the animators of this and it's also the best compliment I can pay. Fun fact, I actually have a degree in Animation so I understand the process that was undertaken to get to this quality. It's not just the animation however, it's the painstaking detail of the sets and the cinematography has to just be admired. There will be times where you are in awe of some of it but not even realise you are doing that.\n\nThe story itself is crazy as it can be with talking Dogs and a dystopian Japan who has banished them onto an island. They've been banished because of dog flu and a government conspiracy in wanting to keep them there. The story didn't really grasp me as it should have. I was more interested in learning more about the dogs but there were times we got a lot of what was happening with the cure and the re-election. It served its purpose of the story and with Wes Anderson's style of storytelling, to be expected.\n\nThe voice acting is a real strength of the movie with Bryan Cranston voicing Chief, the main dog. There's fun comedic moments that aren't forced and little traits like the constant sneezing, that keep the movie entertaining. I've read a few reviews saying that it's an insult that the dogs talk English yet the humans talk Japanese, except most of it is translated via a translator. The movie blatantly makes this abundantly clear that this is the case, even making a bit of a joke about it, breaking the fourth wall a touch. It's in no way insulting to the culture and I enjoyed the culture of it. The fourth wall breaking wasn't excessive and was just the dog's turning to face the screen a couple of times, it was fun and it involved the audience. My favourite has got to be the Oracle, such a great character and when you see it, you'll know why.\n\nDIAGNOSIS - INPATIENT CARE\n\nI feel I haven't even discussed most of this movie but that simply because it's going to take a couple of watches to fully appreciate everything in it. You can't help but admire the quality of the movie and the uniqueness of it. You'll never see anything like this in the cinema and it's Wes Anderson at his finest. \n\nMatt",

The dog pack is fun enough, but there's a scene midway through where they basically get killed. They turn out to have had a miraculous mistake, but they have no role from then on. I genuinely think they were meant to die there in a passing joke and never come back. Even the hero boy Atari didn't seen noble, just stubborn. He bosses the dogs around like he's their king and forces them to play fetch. That might be because we can't understand him (in one of the film's more amusing conceits the dogs bark in English while everyone else speaks in Japanese) but I don't think so.\n\nIn fact, the emotional heart of the film seems awfully dark. The dogs are basically slaves. We see precious few signs of affection from their masters so is the fact that the dogs are eager to return to the masters who willingly abandoned them really sweet, or is it just that they've been conditioned over years of slavery to only find satisfaction from obedience to their masters. I'm not alone finding that uncomfortable, right? I suppose this is a common issue with talking pet movies, but it's pretty blatant here that they obey not through love but by their very nature.",

            "content": "Wes Anderson's Isle of Dogs is a movie to be reckoned with. This incredibly unique piece of stop motion animation is totally different from the norm of today's films. Written and directed by Wes Anderson, it stars the voices of Bryan Cranston as Chief, Edward Norton as Rex, Bill Murray as Boss, Liev Schreiber as Spots, Bob Balaban as King, Scarlett Johansson as Nutmeg and Jeff Goldblum as Duke.  It also stars Koyu Rankin as the young boy, Atari. It is the second animated film from Wes Anderson, after the wonderful Fantastic Mr. Fox.\n\nIn future Japan, where dogs are viewed as savage and disease ridden creatures, a young boy, Atari, searches for his dog, Spots. This dystopian world, created by his guardian, Mayor Kobayashi, disparages dogs but worships cats. Atari defies his guardian and along the way befriends some loyal, passionate pooches who help him on his fateful journey of finding his lost dog. \n\nOne thing I particularly adore about Wes Anderson's filmmaking is his irreverent humour and creativity. It's almost as if Anderson has a patent on an new genre of filmmaking, that's entirely his own. During the making of this film, Anderson was influenced by his love for Japanese cinema and two of the most monumental Japanese directors - Akira Kurosawa and Hayao Miyazaki. In an interview about his many influences for the film, he states \"with Miyazaki you get nature and you get moments of peace, a kind of rhythm that is not in the American animation tradition...\". Later on, Anderson explains that during the scoring of the film he and his composer, Alexandre Desplat, had to rethink their approach to the soundtrack because the movie longed to be quiet. He later specifies that this aspect of the film also comes from Miyazaki. \n\nThe stop motion animation style pairs perfectly with the pure grittiness of its creativity. In most animated films you don't hear the roughness or coarseness of the actors' voices, but in Anderson's film you do and it is the most lifelike.  Also, despite the humor, Anderson doesn't sugar coat the seriousness of the story. His films are always truthful and cut to the heart of the matter. \n\nI recommend Isle of Dogs for ages 12 to 18, due to its violence and sophisticated humour. Younger kids might not understand the ironic tone. I give it 5 out of 5 stars for bringing an incredibly unique vision to the mostly mundane animation of today. \n\nREviewed by clayton p., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

I was touched by maniac level of attention to detail in every scene. \n\nI can still remember the drum beat in the intro and outro that made my heart beat wild. I remember the round eyes that all varied in colors in the dogs. I remember the wind that ruffled the furs and feathers, and slightly crooked little teeth of humans and dogs. Whistling of Atari, Chief and hooting of the owl were refreshing were smoothing and chilling kind of like the first lick of mint on my tongue. \n\nThere's a bit of political nuance that seems timely. Humans got manipulated by an alpha male who's hungry for power but funny enough, the dogs found order even in the banishment on the trash island voting for decisions, respecting one another as all equal alpha dogs, and maintaining integrity even when they found themselves a large piece of fresh meat, Atari. \n\nLiving in today's world does feel like we're under Kobayashi's regime. Students who corrected this course of history in Megasaki echoed The March for Life that took place this weekend. This charming plot somehow instilled hope in me and I walked out of this theater filled with joy. \n\nThis movie was beautiful in every way (even typography and graphics of the posters too!).

The voice talent on display is also top-shelf stuff and seemingly endless. Cranston, Norton, Schreiber, Murray, Johannsen, Goldblum, Murray Abraham - the list goes on and on, and so much of the talent is used to produce witty, rapid-fire jokes and expertly paced character development. Desplat's score deviates from his lush, melodic norm to deliver an aggressive and traditional Japanese musical score, while also delivering those classic moments with untraditional instrumentation. It may be Anderson at his most self-indulgent, but this is what I love about his films. Every time a Wes Anderson film comes out I look forward to seeing how he takes a long standing, traditional medium and puts his own spin on nearly everything, from camera work to storytelling. He takes film and molds it to fit his unique style and quirks, and it's always a treat to witness.

The story is entertaining. I was invested throughout. However, the film felt a little too long. There were some plot issues that I won’t delve into because of spoilers. Anderson made a certain choice that I do not understand. Also, Anderson plays it way to safe. He does everything typical of a Wes Anderson film, but not overly much else. While that still adds up to a good movie, it doesn’t add up to a great one. Overall, this is a sweet and enjoyable film. While I was disappointed, I still enjoyed it a lot. ",

            "content": "Wes Anderson films are often viewed as pieces of art that transcend the medium's limitations, moving paintings brought to life by a one-of-a-kind brushstroke. They're rarely perfect (or perhaps just a little too perfect), but always rewarding and enlightening, mostly because of their relentless honesty and commitment in showing the benefits of unexpected spurts of violence is such proper worlds. And isn't that most people's lives, an existence governed by rules enhanced by moments of pure, unadulterated rebellion? No other movie in Wes Anderson's canon embodies that sentiment so effectively as Isle of Dogs, the filmmaker's returns to stop-motion animation almost ten years later. If Fantastic Mr. Fox had shown the potential of such playground for someone with Anderson's obsessively detailed vision, Isle of Dogs is a fully realized utopia. At once an apt metaphor for today's political instability, and a touchingly dark narrative of loss and acceptance, the film's craftsmanship is unlike anything seen before. From the lush, textured character design to the transfixing beauty of the miniatures, the film's able to create a meditative-like experience, a stunningly harmonious blend of drama and comedy, sadness and ecstasy, indifference and nostalgia. In that regard, Anderson's awe of Akira Kurosawa is noticeable: the fundamental 'human' decency, the damaged people looking for their place in the world, the ethically driven narrative. This is all deconstructed in a simple tale of a boy looking for his lost dog, or, a dog looking for his lost boy, depending on you choose to interpret it. Either way, attached there's a deeply sentimental love letter to true friendships wrapped in a cunning satire, and it's gripping all the way through. Isle of Dogs is a career-defining achievement by any metric, and quite possibly, the filmmaker's best.",

            "content": "A delightful adventure with dogs!\n\nWes Anderson has directed another sweet, yet mature movie. Isle of Dogs is not as whimsical as Fantastic Mr. Fox, but it surpasses expectations with a quirky story filled with wild characters. The stop motion animation and clay-mation is immaculate. Anderson refined his animation style from Fantastic Mr. Fox, while sacrificing compelling storytelling. The plot of Isle of Dogs unfortunately meanders its way to the finale. Audiences will have fun the whole way through, even with the slower pace. But I think most viewers will find Isle of Dogs confusing or alienating in its odd, yet charming approach.\n\nThe voice acting is excellent overall. I am particularly pleased by the vocal work of Edward Norton, Bryan Cranston, Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum, and Harvey Keitel. Greta Gerwig and Scarlett Johansson are alright at their line delivery, but they feel a little forced. Yoko Ono surprises with a few choice lines. The Japanese voice actors all deliver believable dialogue even though I cannot understand them. The choice to not use subtitles is off putting as well as funny at times with the interpreters throughout. Wes Anderson's all star cast will impress most viewers with their perfect delivery, but I suspect others will be turned off by how recognizable all the voice actors are sonically. I liked them though!\n\nOne thing Wes Anderson continues to excel at is his symmetrical framing. Every shot finds itself in the ideal visual setup. Figures and backgrounds are aligned for optimal visual equality. Isle of Dogs is certainly visually appealing. All the colors, movement, and juxtaposition are meticulously detailed and lifelike. Isle of Dogs is peak precision in animation.\n\nNotably, I think audiences should disregard the various criticisms of Isle of Dogs as racist, insensitive, or cultural appropriation. I keep waiting for something offensive to happen while watching Isle of Dogs and only found strange delights and fun times. Any outrage at Isle of Dogs is grossly misplaced. This is a fun little animated adventure for adults to enjoy. It has heavy political undertones, but it is not racist. Isle of Dogs is good fun in good taste in my opinion.\n\nLastly, I'd like to mention the traditional Japanese score from master composer Alexandre Desplat. His use of drums are massive in sound. As are Desplat's reaching for cultural authenticity with his utilization of traditional Japanese instruments. The only other music is indie rock songs scattered here and there during the dog bound journey.\n\nIn short, I think most people that undertake the joyous ride that is Isle of Dogs will come out entertained, but not mind blown. Wes Anderson continues his hot streak of excellent quality films. See Isle of Dogs for some levity this tiresome year.",

I made the same mistake with Fantastic Mr. Fox, when I took my  8 -year-old kids and their friend, and spent a good part of the movie squirming because I quickly realized it wasn't appropriate for them. They survived, mostly liked it, and I suppose that'll be the case for the kids I saw in the theater for Isle of Dogs. Maybe Wes Anderson isn't entirely responsible for the way his films are marketed. His features are made for a very quirky adult audience. I get that, and I like his work, but there's something a little off since with relatively few tweaks, this one could actually be a good movie for kids. It's got a nice message. The weird, dry humor isn't going to work for most adults or kids. Sometimes I think Wes Anderson is purposefully weird just to be weird, and while that can be amusing, it can be a weakness too.",

I was surprised that Jason Schwartzman wasn't one of the stars in the movie and the Frances mcdormand had more lines than Jason. Bryan Cranston and Jeff Gollum Goldberg goldblum were also in this film and they were fantastic and I forgot to mention greta gerwig from lady bird and Frances ha. She was good and the little boy who is on trash island with the dogs who spoke Japanese in this film, I forgot his name but at first I hated his character telling dogs what to do and Bryan Cranstons character was angry that a human was telling a dog what to do and I agreed with him that dogs should be their own leaders and that's why I hated the little Japanese kid for the first 35 minutes of the film but then when him and Bryan Cranston s character gets along with him then I start to like him. Another thing is that this movie is PG 13, I thought this movie is PG like fantastic Mr fox but nope, this movie has blood and some swearing and that surprised me because I thought all of Wes Anderson s animated movies were PG and it connects in the end. The art style and all the colors of a Wes Anderson movie are present and their great, and I like how wes Anderson mixes both English and Japanese into this film and saying at the beginning that the dogs are being translated to speak English so that's a funny scene but this movie is a pretty serious movie. Blood, death, and suicide are common themes in this movie and I sorta like it but I sorta don't. I like it because it's a serious animated movie but on the other hand serious animated movies are weird like 2009s 9. That was a serious animated movie and I hated it, this feels like at some times a little too serious but overall a enjoyable movie. If I could give an honest rating I would give this movie a 4.25 out of 5 because it's too serious at times and some story lines are too jumbled up and too many characters doesn't make the film consistent and feels that it should have been longer by a good 45 minutes to make the storylines flow without any problems. I can't wait to see what Wes Anderson does next and he here has another Oscar nomination with this movie for best animated movie but their is some competition between incredibles 2 and wreck it Ralph 2, who will win.",
