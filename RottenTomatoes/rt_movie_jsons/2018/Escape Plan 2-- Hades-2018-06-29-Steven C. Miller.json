It's like taking a Van Gogh painting and defacing it increasingly worse unless only final remaining missing piece is a Michael Bay touch. It's what Ramses II would do after he time traveled to medieval England and stole a bluenprint of a drawn and quartering Catherine wheel and implemented back home. It's what aliens have on a bad trip. It's like a frill-necked lizard with an ear growing out of it's body. It is so botched it actually looks like a Kirchner painting. At my death bed, I would be ruing and reminiscing that only if I had put this 90 odd minutes to doing something I love!",

All worms wear my magic wand on their outsides!\" but the demigods were very upset. So, Pan fell inside her own darkness once again to investigate what had happened when her beloved head worm Hades took over while she was away having a very long and much needed nap.\n\nHades told Pan her demigod kids were overreacting. He had come up with a perfect system of organization, motivation, and a great illusion called \"security\", which gave purpose and hope to all the children instead of letting them mindlessly churn in delusional creativity which was her destructive vice. Didn't she want her kids to be productive and happy? \n\nPan agreed to monitor the children to see if what Hades said was true, and she did witness all kinds of bad childish behavior, and ultimately understood why Hades chose the punishments he did, as he even put a mirror up to Pan to show her when she too deserved such criticism. Pan agreed Hades wasn't evil, but his system of organization caused too much suffering, so she put a spell on the planet to relieve his slaves and let her nature reorganize according to more immaterial planes...like clouds. \n\nOf course Hades was very scared that Pan wanted to move her children into immaterial realms he couldn't control and whined \"My whole Pyramid scheme will collapse!\" as he had control over the rich. Pan assured him \"My spell allows for a very smooth transition of power. Once everyone experiences this new way of living my beloved Hades, you will have much more time to pay attention to your pain-tings and our children will live to share their art with one another which will allow them to enjoy constant transformation.\"\n\nPan kissed Hades and left a love note for the kids \"Don't be jerks, but do enjoy my dark seas. Also, Hades and I agree the Government will be sending out tax bills or withholding and won't mire you with paperwork when they don't have the staffing to handle such antiquated ways of organization. You probably think I wasn't interested in such boring affairs when crafting my future spells, but, you were never supposed to kill Time with paperwork, a huge mistake there. Lots of Love, Pan.\"",

After a job goes bad the team breaks up only to be brought back together when a new secret prison, the titular Hades, threatens one of their own. \n\nThe Good: Dave Bautista is fun for the three minutes or so he is in the movie.\n \nI also like the way the sets are a throwback to the Full Moon pictures of the 1980's with all the neon and bad special effects. \n\nThe Bad: Dave Bautista is the only fun interesting character in the movie. The way he has been arguing with Disney we may see him in a lot more direct to video films like this. His loss is honestly our gain.\n\nThe movie Cube managed a much more effective future prison look on a much smaller budget twenty years ago. I found the sets and special effects hilariously bad. I am not sure the filmmakers really meant that.\n\nThe Ugly: To say this movie's plot makes no sense is an understatement. The futuristic prison contains advanced technology (healing robots, virtual reality etc) that is certainly more profitable to market to the outside world than the current kidnap people and makes them fight so they will reveal the industrial secrets business plan. It is like one of those movies where the bad guy invents a ray that can control the weather and then decided to use it to rob a bank.\n\nIn Conclusion: I have not seen the first Escape Plan but I understand it isn't that bad a movie. Why they thawed out Sylvester Stallone for this junk I have no idea. This is clearly one of those international co-productions meant for foreign audiences. This is not always a bad thing. Bloodrayne is an awful movie filled with international stars but it is also a fun movie filled with sex, violence and hammy acting. This honestly has no action, nudity or violence. Just a bunch of nobodies wandering around a set from 1980's The Apple while some American stars pop in for glorified cameos. More purgatory than Hades I am afraid.",

Like the first Escape Plan movie in which Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone were the two main actors, Escape Plan 2 tricks you into thinking Stallone and Bautista would be the main actors. Instead you get a convoluted story in which Huang Xiaoming is the main actor playing Shu. The story, however, does pick up 2/3rds of the way through the movie when Stallone as Ray finally joins the prison to help Shu escape. \n\nOne of the biggest differences I noticed right away between the first movie and this second one was the limited budget on explosions. They used way too much CGI, poor at that, to create fire and explosions, which really diminishes the action scenes. I miss the days when Hollywood used actual explosions and real fire (I mean, fake fire but \"real\") to make explosive action sequences. \n\nThere are so many things wrong with this movie, but it's also an interesting story and if you can bypass the awkward scenes and the lack of Stallone and Bautista, it's enjoyable... but probably better to wait until it's free. After watching Escape Plan 2, to me it's no surprise this movie didn't make it to theaters and went straight to OnDemand and Redbox.",

The deceptive poster and billing (that Sly and Bautista are stars when in fact they are hardly in it) is not even among the top 5 worst things about this movie. 1) Story is incoherent. No scene relates to the previous one or the next. I couldn't tell you what I just saw, and I was paying attention. 2) Characters are written to not care about them. 3) No clear antagonist. 4) No clear caper. 5) Characters don't behave like real people. For example, *in the middle of a car chase,* the driver calls another character to explain who he is chasing so that the viewer understands the exposition dump. I know that when I pursue someone in a high speed chase, I always ring my bud to inform him of what I'm doing for no reason at all.",

It isn't good, but almost \"Stallone bad\"... almost. The first Escape Plan was enjoyably lowbrow while Escape Plan 2: Hades is depressingly low budget, and hold on to your barf bags because we're facing down an Escape Plan trilogy. The third (Devil's Station) having been shot back to back with part 2... This is not a good sign.

He could, however, kick and punch his way out of a wet paper bag if that entertains you. The entire film forfeits itself to the so-called success the first one had overseas and it shows. It's a low-rate, crap kung-fu film. This really, really, really sucks. Stallone should be ashamed and embarrassed that he would take part in this abomination.
