    "summary": "Dr. Don Shirley is a world-class African-American pianist who's about to embark on a concert tour in the Deep South in 1962. In need of a driver and protection, Shirley recruits Tony Lip, a tough-talking bouncer from an Italian-American neighborhood in the Bronx. Despite their differences, the two men soon develop an unexpected bond while confronting racism and danger in an era of segregation.",

It explores the racism and homophobia of the times in the North and Southern United States. \nHowever, I must say that it definitely didn't deserve to win best picture at the Oscars. This was a 3/4 star film and at best should've only been nominated. Movies similar such as Shawshank Redemption, Green Mile and Driving Miss Daisy were 4/4 star films and thus were better than Greenbook and deserved Best Picture. I think this film won for two reasons, 1. Their weren't that many other good films that came out the same year. And 2. The Oscars at times tend to pick films that are about something serious like racism, etc.",

Its a somewhat thoughtful film I suppose, given the story, a fairly well known story I suppose (a novel by Charles Dickens), though I wasn't familiar with it personally, other than by name. I'm not sure there's much I can say about it - I'm not too keen on David Walliams - I'm not exactly a fan of him normally and it felt a little 'off' to have him appear in such a period film but perhaps I'm a little unfair? judge for yourself and also it goes without saying that Helena Bonham Carter is very much suited to her role - I imagine she enjoyed playing Miss Haversham very much and she certainly looks the part, as the gothic, somewhat ghostly lady living in a dark and run down mansion/house of sorts. Yes, overall I would recommend this as a decent film of its type.",

The wonderful, complex, sparring, evolving and mutually enlightening relationship between Don and  Tony is exquisitely portrayed which makes it one of those rare cinematic experiences that truly encompasses more than its two hours ten minutes might promise. The balance in Green Book impresses me too, with themes of family, race, friendship, the scourge of intolerance and the liberation of acceptance combined in such a natural, spontaneous way that I'd recommend this as more or less essential viewing for film makers wanting to treat with these theses - this one gets it right, guys.

            "content": "My main reason for watching 'Green Book' was due to me wanting to see as many 2018 films as possible, and that it had won the Best Picture Oscar (so naturally wanted to see too that it was that good). Like Viggo Mortensen as an actor, the film's concept was appealing and it looked appetising. Word of mouth, including from very trusted friends online and in real life, was very positive so there were plenty of other reasons too.\n\n'Green Book' turned out to be when watching a very good film and nearly a great one with many fantastic things. Wouldn't go as far to say that it is my favourite film of 2018, and as far as the other Best Picture nominees go there was a preference for 'Roma' and 'The Favourite', but if to put it in a group of either best, solid middle and worst films of the year 'Green Book' would be closest to being in the best category of those three groups. It is a very, very well done film and its good intentions are evident throughout and noble.\n\nIt could have done with more grit in places, really do appreciate that it was trying not to be heavy-handed or trying to offend with a quite heavy theme but they could have done more with it and given a little more depth to what there was. Not saying it wasn't there, quite the contrary, just wish there was more.\n\nCredit is due for the laudable and successful efforts in making the story accessible and it is one that easy to like and get into, but actually it could have afforded to do a little more risk-taking and have a little more complexity.\n\nViggo Mortensen though brings a lot of charm and entertainment value to his role, and Mahershala Ali is a dignified and very moving contrast. Their chemistry is wholly natural and beautifully irresistible (never feeling contrived or rushed) which provides a lot of 'Green Book's' heart, while their characters are more than just characters and instead feel very human. This is very different territory for director Peter Farrelly and it is surprisingly restrained direction from him and it suits the material very well. It's a lovely looking film too and affectionately photographed, while the music is beautifully chosen and fitted some nice nostalgic song choices here.\n\nThe script is thoughtful, charming and also moving, and regardless of anybody feeling that it is a little too accessible and could have done with more grit the story kept me riveted and left me moved, inspired and like my heart had been warmed. The YMCA scene is a powerful one and a character development turning point handled beautifully.\n\nSumming up, one of those very good and nearly great films. 8/10",

I saw a lot of people recommending this movie on the internet. This movie not only won three Oscar awards for Best Picture, Best Film Editing, and Best Original Screenplay, but also won Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor. From all I've heard, I had  very high expectations for this movie and it turns out it didn't let me down and even better than I thought it would.\n\nA story is about a relationship between black touring pianist Don Shirley and his white Italian personal driver Tony Lip by the main subjects is to reflect funny given its rather serious social setting of racial discrimination in 1960s America but funny is still given along the movie. Tony Vallelonga used to be a bouncer at  a 1960s nightclub in New York but ended up as a temporary personal driver to African-American pianist Don Shirley. They need to carry The Green Book, a guide to hotels and restaurants hospitable to black people during the drive down south. The movie includes sexual identity subject once then moves on without any other discussion. The two characters are contrasted in both personality and social status but they get to learn from each other during this 8 weeks drive. Don is a virtuoso who has a snobbish manner. He always responds to every racial slight and stands for himself which is really inspiring and impressive. Conversely, Tony is a chill person. He represents an ignorant person who wouldn't take any action in racism. Their road trip makes them have self-discovery as well as exploring other different societies. \n\nOverall, I think The Green Book is a really great movie that has an impact on the subject about racism along the route of road-tripping with the guide book. It is really inspiring in terms of maintaining self dignity and reminds me to always respect others and also my own self.",

            "content": "This film is a wonderful example of how biography, comedy, and drama can all work together. I had never heard of or read about this film before seeing it, which gave me an unexpected thought about it. At first, I believe that this film will be similar to other biographical films that I have seen in the past, boring and unpersuasive. However, after watching it for ten minutes, I am blown away by what I perceive. This film has taught me something new that I didn't know before, and the actors are completely immersed in their characters.\n\nDr. Don Shirley, an African American intelligent pianist, and Tony Lip, a tough bouncer hired to be Dr. Don's personal driver since the nightclub where he previously worked was closed for renovations, were initially unimpressed in one other. They have no idea what each other has gone through or what they need to be face with. Taking us back to that time, even if he was a great pianist, the black guy constantly struggled to acquire respect from others. Despite the fact that many people want to listen to the music he performs, they nevertheless act as though black people are not on the same level as them. Even if they didn't say it out loud, their actions did.\n\nThe film depicts the development of characters while also showing the progress of their relationship. It's as though they're demonstrating that even people with opposing personalities may one day open their hearts to one another. This film is of the biography genre and is based on a true story so that the viewer may understand how black people were treated in the past. The Negro Motorist Green Book, a guideline for black people's safety on the road, is an excellent illustration of how people thought in the past. The messages that this film conveys are very strong, especially in terms of friendship and the problem of racism, as can be seen.\n\nDespite the fact that the film deals with the extremely stressful and heavy topic of \"racism,\" it nonetheless has some comedy. To conclude, this is one of the greatest biographical films that I have seen so far, and I would suggest it to anybody who is interested in those topics or just want to see a film that has a fantastic mix of everything. Out of ten, I definitely give this film score of 9.5!",

A story about a relationship between black touring piano virtuoso Don Shirley and his white Italian bodyguard driver Tony Lip sounds relatively mundane on paper, but the movie is remarkably funny given its rather serious social setting of racial discrimination in 1960s America. The movie sends a clear message about the inhumanity of racial discrimination with its underpinnings of control and power and how human connection can transcend racial barriers, but it's the character Don Shirley's response to every racial slight that leaves an inspiring and lasting impression. The character chooses dignity above all else and suffers not only humiliation but also the pain of self-restraint. The movie ends on an uplifting note, but it is the quiet anguish of a dignified response in the face of oppression that will be remembered.",

I'd put this off for a long time, but this time the Random Film Generator gave me no choice, and I really tried to keep an open mind. But this is a clod-hoppingly cloying, naive, sometimes downright insulting racism drama that's elevated by two quite brilliant performances from Mahershala Ali (no coincidence that his Oscar was for Supporting Role rather than Leading ...) and Viggo Mortensen. They are in a different film altogether, one with grace notes, subtleties and intelligence that they must have mined from somewhere other than screenplay or direction. Recognition for the likes of Moonlight and Parasite in recent years don't make up for the elevation of this very ordinary film to heights and publicity it doesn't deserve (central performances aside), but they suggest that there may be some forward steps being taken. Sometimes. Meanwhile, if you must watch this, do so for the acting.",

While Ali is fantastic from start to finish, Mortensen, despite the accolades heaped upon him, at times overplays his part to the point where it's laughable.

We were able to empathize with Tony, who despite all his faults, still loves and does everything for his family, and for Shirley, an unparalleled skill that has become his gift and his curse. He is a pianist genius, and while people admire him for his art, they despise him for being black. Because of this dichotomy, he feels lost, belonging nowhere, on the one hand, being an educated person with values \u200b\u200btotally different from his peers, on the other, a black man, whom many white people despise.

It also proves another proverb true, \"To really know someone, travel with them.\" \nI almost didn't recognize my beloved Viggo, previously cemented as Aragorn in a classic trilogy. But his depiction of Tony Vallelonga in this movie is really memorable, he slides into the role with the same ease as he digs into a bowl of homemade pasta and meatballs. A worldly wisdom, a straightforward honesty, and a strong moral code of a man who grew up in rough streets. Swift with the blunt fists and the sharp words alike. \nMahershala Ali as Shirley was also really well played, a man truly lost between worlds, belonging to none, with a blistering genius that only increases his isolation. One truly feels sorry for his self deprecating analysis as a puppet on strings, an erudite carnival showman, a bizarre exhibit surrounded by racism. \nThe lovely message of this movie is the ability of these two men to learn from each other, to embrace each other's world views, and in the end to valiantly rise in friendship and mutual respect. We could all learn from their journey, especially to never underestimate the knowledge and wisdom we can share to become better people.\nAs with any period piece I adored the authentic reproduction of a bygone \u2018simpler' age steeped in dark racism and hate. The nostalgia of the past is a dangerous thing when it whitewashes what really happened in sundown towns and plantations, even after the civil war. The Green Book is as insidious a piece of literature as Mein Kampf, born from the same cauldron of hate.",

The time period is depicted in a way that, compared to recently released media/films/series, is understated. The commentary on the treatment of the music prodigy-who happens to be black is depicted with dignity for the man and the way he still holds his head high in the face of ignorance and bullying. The audience, for obvious reasons, is immediately on his side but it's not beaten into them. This is also like the way being around Mr Shirley changes Lip and he learns to respect himself and a culture of people he previously stereotyped. When he is racially abused too he responds violently and he struggles to understand why Mr Shirley can stand it.  A Green book is something I didn't know existed and like other parts of the film serves to entertain, educate all without beating it into someone - this is cemented by the fact the \"true story\" information isn't even mentioned until the credits. Social commentary, fun scenes, music, chemistry  and humour. Very nice film.",

He is invited to an interview with Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), a black pianist in need of a driver for his eight-week concert tour through the Midwest and Deep South. Don hires Tony on the strength of his references. They embark with plans to return to New York City on Christmas Eve. Don's record label gives Tony a copy of the Green Book, a guide for African-American travelers to find motels, restaurants, and filling stations that would serve them. They begin the tour in the Midwest before eventually heading farther south. Tony and Don initially clash as Tony feels uncomfortable being asked to act with more refinement, while Don is disgusted by Tony's habits. As the tour progresses, Tony is impressed with Don's talent on the piano, and is increasingly appalled by the discriminatory treatment which Don receives from his hosts and the general public when he is not on stage. A group of white men beat Don and threaten his life in a bar and Tony rescues him. He instructs Don not to go out without him for the rest of the tour. Throughout the journey, Don helps Tony write letters to his wife Dolores (Linda Cardellini), which deeply move her. Tony encourages Don to get in touch with his own estranged brother, but Don is hesitant, observing that he has become isolated by his professional life and achievements...\n\nRotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads: \"Green Book takes audiences on a surprisingly smooth ride through potentially bumpy subject matter, fueled by Peter Farrelly's deft touch and a pair of well-matched leads.\" Writing for The San Francisco Chronicle, Mick LaSalle praised Ali and Mortensen and said: \"...there's something so deeply right about this movie, so true to the time depicted and so welcome in this moment; so light in its touch, so properly respectful of its characters, and so big in its spirit, that the movie acquires a glow. It achieves that glow slowly, but by the middle and certainly by the end, it's there, the sense of something magical happening, on screen and within the audience.\" Steve Pond of TheWrap wrote, \"The movie gets darker as the journey goes further South, and as the myriad indignities and humiliations mount. But our investment in the characters rarely flags, thanks to Mortensen and Ali and a director who is interested in cleanly and efficiently delivering a story worth hearing.\"\n\n\"Green Book\" is inspired by the true story of a tour of the Deep South by African American classical and jazz pianist Don Shirley and Italian American bouncer Frank \"Tony Lip\" Vallelonga who served as Shirley's driver and bodyguard. The film received numerous accolades and nominations, and at the 91st Academy Awards, it won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actor for Ali. Personally I think that \"Green Book\" is predictable and \"adjusted\" with a story we have seen before with an interracial friendship that develop a mutual exchange of perspectives and common grounds. I think as well that this topic is not served all too well in a \"comic\" package due to the direction by Peter Farrelly. I felt the same with Spike Lee\u00b4s \"BlacKkKlansman\". But, that\u00b4s my personal point of view as I think the topic is difficult and it is as current as ever and I want it to be taken more seriously. We do get some great moments between Ali and Mortensen. But, I was ultimately not blown away as many others were. But, cred for the nice 60s settings. And I do like Linda Cardellini.",

People, especially the ones at the Oscars, overcompensate the themes of racism and bigotry into this movie, when really it's anything but. Instead, it's your typical run-of-the-mill story about two polar opposites that at first bite each other and they turn up as friends in the end. While Peter Farrelly, Brian Currie and Nick Vallelonga sneak in the two motifs in the movie, Green Book tells its formulaic story like a race-swapped Driving Miss Daisy. However, when the 1960's racist politics pop up, it can be uncomfortably forced, like the \"I'm not like most black people\" moment where Shirley eats KFC for the first time. I guess this act is a symbol of friendship, but I just groan when the movie tries too hard to be anti-racist. Then again, I'm watching a movie titled after the African American segregation tour books at the time, so I guess I shouldn't complain too much. Then, there's this Planes, Trains and Automobiles moment in the end where Shirley arrives at Tony's place for his Christmas Eve party because Shirley's all alone in Carnegie Hall. With him being a famous person of his time, I can't help but strongly doubt that nobody in New York City would make a solitary attempt to throw a party for him, especially with all his trials and tribulations in the South. Despite its efforts, Green Book had unoriginal storylines, forced racial pandering to easy-to-please audiences, and a sappy Hollywood execution. \n\n(2 Jade Stones out of 5)",

I do not think this movie was made to be an anthem or to tell us everything about racial issues in the US. It is not a philosophical document - it is a story based on facts about two man who become friends for the rest of their lives, despite strong cultural and social barriers. The chemistry that developed between the main two characters is the essence of this movie. This is the message that we need nowadays. Just two individuals becoming more sensitive and understanding to problems of others and who can count on each other when facing troubles or dangers. \nWe do not need big institutions or big heads to fix the world. We only need to be like these two guys shown in this movie. Brotherhood among millions is almost impossible, but brotherhood between two souls is not only achievable but it is probably the strongest type of bond that can unite people of different races. There is a place in history for people like Luther King but everyday life circles around stories like this one. Law or institutional changes can only achieve so much but the real change happens at much lower level, in the heart of every man. It is not possible to truly love millions of people or to have meaningful relationship with them all but it is possible to find a soul mate in one person if we look outside of our social bubble. \nThat message is very powerful and much underestimated or ignored by so called critics.",

As I know this film is enough new for us and was released in 2018 by Peter Farrelly. Also it's important to say that the genre of the film is biographical comedy-drama. \nThis film is fantastic! On the one hand, it has really funny moments without any banality, but on the other hand, it has a really deep and thought-provoking plot. I've listened about this film so many times and had a fear that this film will be overrated, but I really erred \u2013 the film is brilliant! I want to mark the picture and setting of the film in particular. The music is splendid and well-chosen. It has an especial atmosphere that makes to feel that time. \nThe director was inspired by the true story of two people: African American classical and jazz pianist Don Shirley and Italian American bouncer Frank Vallelonga that accompanied Don as driver and bodyguard in a tour to the Deep South. They had a lot of obstacles by way of disrespectful relations toward Don Shirley. And of course we see how characters change during their tour. The first person becomes simpler as a man but more respectful toward himself and the second person becomes more respectful toward others.\nThanks to outstanding cast \"Green Book\" became so realistic and so unparalleled. Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen were really perfect and played in their characters as good as it was possible. \nI don't want to tell you all the details, but I think that it's worth seeing, because the film makes to think about those who are successful, because for their smile and glory they can hide humiliation and bore their misfortunes bravely.",

The black person, in southern states, had few rights until the landmark civil rights bills of 1964-65.  This film shows us some of milder white reaction to black people.  Murders, lynchings are violence of all kinds was par for the course in these states.  The movie does a great job telling a true story -- one that involved a high-ranking official in the Kennedy administration to bring justice for Dr. Shirley.  \nThe soundtrack is the worst aspect of the film.  Only one song, \"Slow Twistin'\" by Chubby Checker is reminiscent of 1962.  If the filmmakers really wanted to set the mood for 1962 they would not have used songs from the 40s and 50s and pretended that was what Americans were listening to in 1962.",

(b) Acting: Do the actors disappear into their roles, or merely mouth a script like Bogart? (c) Direction: Does it show some inspiration, or is it just a recording of performances? Green Book excels, we feel, in (a) and (b). The direction would not rival Vertigo, but it's adequate. What gives the picture life is the compelling narrative and characters.

            "content": "\"Frequently, when someone tries to portray the overwhelming decade of the 1960s, they usually misuse the concept of discrimination towards African Americans, which is accurate to describe this social issue. Nevertheless, the way Peter Farrelly and staff go into detail about this social wretchedness embodying the psychological impact it has in the main character makes the film an outstanding one\".\n...\nThe year is 1962, and the film begins inside Copacabana restaurant where we get introduced the imposing personality of Tony Lip, an Italian descendant whose family came from a lower middle class coping with some financial difficulties. The way Viggo Mortensen performs the character is a proper model of then American racism; therefore he attempted to keep them out until the occasion arrived and Don Shirley appeared in his path, offering him a two-month lifetime opportunity. We all need to bear in mind the precise dates because, in real life, it was nearly a year they spent together. Despite his gifted pianist skills and his upper-class status, he was still a victim of the convulsed cultural impact. Both of them, during the film, learn from each other and fight against the unsettling behaviour of determined people. Although it may seem simple, their interaction is one of the primary reasons why it succeeds. Believe it or not, it arouses curiosity, reaches the climax when they finally let them know as they are, and sometimes it results as a plot twister due to the radical temperament change of each actor. It has been ages since I watched such a pleasant film; afterwards, I felt refreshed as though it renewed me.\n...\nThe contextualisation was imperative to build up each one's personality; moreover, it was visually dazzling owing to the costumes, the space and the background advertisement of the decade. Comedy is present as well so that you won't be missing from genuine laughs. Everything appears to be perfectly balanced, even the role of secondary personages such as Tony's wife and the cheeky cards experience. I'm chuffed to bits!\n...\nOn the whole, the film \"Green Book\" is an exceptional example of the conception of a masterpiece without spending loads of money in production and without creating plenty of trifling scenarios.\n...\n(88/100)\n...\nIf you want to check out more on films, go to https://davidtejada210.wixsite.com/tpepage",

Green Book would be a pleasant, forgettable cable TV movie in 1996, but this one dimensional road movie is just not Oscar-worthy...with the exception of the terrific Mahershala Ali. Director Peter Farrelly is the wrong choice for this one, as he can't dig beneath the service of either the key relationship or the troubled setting. It's all too lightweight and episodic to score any points.  Farrelly just approaches it like another of his mismatched characters hit the road comedies.",

The concept of the \"Green Book,\" which was new to me, is fascinating. Viggo Mortensen as Tony \"Lip\" seemed a little too stereotypical of an Italian-American at first (think the first season of The Sopranos), but I thought he transitioned more smoothly as the film went on and really appreciated his performance by the end.

But caught it twice over Xmas on Showtime and it really ripped my heart out having been raised both in the north and south in the 60's-70's as a kid right after segregation - and as a Caucasian that was bussed to all black schools, which definitely taught me a lot as a child... plus living in Texas for 15 more years (bussing was in Memphis) - I'm just sad and sometimes ashamed at our society on the whole (or humanity) that such even segregation existed only 40-50 years ago. And obviously remnants still remain today. But as for this film, as the Rotten Tomatoes write up says; it takes viewers on a ride thru a very bumpy topic (topics actually) - But is a must see for those that struggle with understanding the Mason Dixon line and \"life in the south vs the north\". The premise is an amazing canvass in which to tell this story (and ultimately the moral to the story) - and whilst uncomfortable at times to watch, the director or writer takes you right to the edge, then slowly backs away without too much violence or unnecessary conflicts, yet you will feel it in your soul. Extremely well written and acted and while I don't know the actors - the ending and their performances were just amazing. So after seeing it for a 2nd time, I decided to research it more and was thrilled to see its high audience rating on Rotten Tomatoes. So I'm not alone in thinking this is a great film \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb  \n\nGiven the divided country and world we live in these days (2020) I think films like this (that are accurate/believable and in the end, all is well) offers hope when it seems we're all fighting daily and now internationally - and its just time for everyone to chill and realize there's more important things in life than careers or possessions or status. Our family and friends and stepping outside of our comfort zones and making the effort to mend bridges that were burnt decades ago - that definitely still need mending and this film is a great reminder of ways to help start healing some of those wounds - if even just one mans journey. It's hard to explain as I don't want to spoil the film - but think we all could use a large dose of forgiveness, empathy, compassion and most of all, forgiveness plus a better understanding of the larger world around us and that tolerance (or acceptance) of those different than us as this would go a very long way in laying down the first steps to a more peaceful and loving world.

The Italian protagonist most likely kept in his memory afterwards that there was this one black guy who wasn't like the others. I doubt he changed his attitude toward our black fellow citizens in general.\n\nAnd I have a great and lasting problem with the ridiculous title. The movie is not really about the experience of black people traveling through the south, it is about one white guy's introduction to this fact. Baaaaah. Watch it, sure. But I want very much a completely different story someday, with Mahershala Ali in the lead, that takes us through first hand what it was like to travel while black in the US deep South.

            "content": "Peter Farally's Green Book raised quite a few eyebrows (and set off a fair number of eye roles) when it won best picture at the Oscars. Audiences and critics have praised the film for its wit, humor, and committed lead performances, while detractors have accused it of being overly glib, and made disparaging comparisons to Driving Miss Daisy. In my humble opinion, the naysayers are mostly wrong. This isn't to say that Green Book is perfect, but I would consider it a very good movie.\n\nBoth Mortensen and Ali's performances are excellent, and together their chemistry is nothing short of incredible. As Tony Lip, Mortensen is rough, uncouth, and quick tempered, with a real mouth on him. And he's casually racist. Not the most likeable guy, at least until some of his employer's charm and smarts start to rub off on him. Mortensen makes the character work because he never sugar-coats who Tony is or tries too hard to make him likeable, but neither does he force the racism, turning him into a completely unlikable caricature.\n\nFor his part, Ali is keenly intelligent, sophisticated, semi-reserved, and just a bit eccentric as Don Shirley. He frequently brings a palpable frustration and annoyance, whether at ignorance and somewhat loose ethics of his new driver, or the less than ideal circumstances he finds himself in. But he always manages a level of self control befitting a man of his refinement. Well, nearly always. When the damn breaks and he lets loose it provides some of the movie's best emotional catharsis and deepest reflections on race and identity.\n\n And there are some very deep, frequently thought provoking, and often uncomfortable meditations on race and society, driven by some truly brilliant dialog. And as the movie goes on, they're increasingly inter-spaced with the lighthearted and genuinely heartwarming moments as the two men warm up to each other. There are some pretty funny moments, as seen in the trailer, and some truly wonderful music. Green Book is by no means a full on musical, but there's a lot of excellent piano playing, and a very fun blues performance towards the end.\n\nNow I'd like to address some of the criticisms of this film. \nDespite what some critics have said, Green Book doesn't fall into the White Savior trope. Yes, Tony pulls Doctor Shirley out of some jams. He literally saves him from a close call at a bar. But that's what actually happened. And Shirley pulls him out of some tough spots too. Nor does it succumb to the \"Magical Negro\" trope. Much of the movie does revolve around how Shirley helps Tony learn and grow as a person. But it's not a one-sided relationship. Both men learn new things, see new viewpoints, and get a better idea of who they are as a result of their interactions, and if Tony has more growth, that's because he had a lot more growing to do in the first place.\n\nIt is true that the movie doesn't spend a whole lot of time addressing Shirley's homosexuality.  But it's not like they leave it out or tiptoe around, and between issues of race and class Green Book already has plenty of worthy issues on its plate. The filmmakers were never setting out to make another Moonlight. Now I would have liked to see more of the actual Green Book and its contents, which only appear briefly. I also found a few bits here and there a tad slow, and and the first half had more cringy and awkward moments than I would have liked, though perhaps that was unavoidable.\n\nNo, Green Book didn't deserve best picture, and I have no idea what the people at the Globes were smoking when they awarded it best musical or comedy. But it's a satisfying road movie, a deservedly feel good story about race, and one of the better films of 2018.\n",

It was so fun and entertaining to watch these two characters grow together and look out for one another.  Some people complained about this movie not being totally accurate as the movie takes the segregation to a safe minimal.  The movie is PG-13 which I honestly thought was a smart choice.  This allows younger people to be able to watch the movie and still understand what the U.S. used to be like and how racism is wrong.  We don't always need rated R movies to tell us racism is bad, this movie can show everyone that it doesn't matter what skin color you have because we are all equal, and I thought that was really beautiful.  I do have to admit the beginning of the movie went a little slow for me.  I didn't like the opening sequence and didn't think it had much to do with the overall plot.  The movie really started getting good for me when we are first introduced to Dr. Shirley.  I also don't necessarily love the title.  The Green Book is something that appears in the movie a couple of times but didn't have the largest significance and didn't really have anything to do with the message they were going for.

            "content": "I'd heard rumblings from people, griping that some of the details may have been altered from the facts, that some events might have been slightly changed. And also, there was some talk that they made the white guy a bit more of a hero than he was in real life.\n\nWell, to be honest, for me, even if they did make those changes, I really didn't see that sort of 'white-washing' in this movie.\n\nSet in 1962, a classically-trained black pianist hires a white Italian from the Bronx to be his driver, and personal assistant during a concert tour of the deep south. Knowing there would be some trouble while dealing with racial tensions during the pre-civil rights era south, Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) hires Tony Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) to help navigate these tough waters.\n\nRight from the outset, we see these two couldn't be more different. Tony is a guy living on the periphery of organized crime in the Bronx, working at the Copacabana, and Dr. Shirley lives above a concert hall in a luxury apartment filled with statues, elephant tusks, and artwork from around the world.\n\nNow we've all seen movies like this before, and we know where the story is probably going to take us. We will head to the deep south, where Shirley will encounter racism, and Tony will be the hired muscle to help him through it. And they'll both learn a little something about each other along the way.\n\nBut there were a few things that make this movie extra special.\n\n1) Usually in movies featuring the black/white dynamic, it's the white guy who is the 'educated' one, and it's up to the black guy to show him just how uncool he is (Kevin Hart, I'm talking to you)...but in this movie, it was the other way around. It was the black character who is smarter, more refined, more learned, and has a lot to teach Tony about the world. So that was a nice change of pace.\n\nIt was also nice to see the two characters slowly embrace their differences. At first, Tony has the standard pushback. \"Ehhh, I don't need nobody to tell me how to use a napkin\". But he soon sees that maybe he has a little room to grow and improve. Same goes for Dr. Shirley. At first, he sees the guy in the driver's seat as this uncouth baboon, worthy of little more than snark and dismay, but ultimately there's something he could learn from him too.\n\n2) The performace of Mahershala Ali was something very special. The character of Dr. Shirley could have easily been a one-dimensional snob that goes nowhere fast...but there's an underlying fear and scared little child just under the surface of Ali's performance. He's someone who has lived on the edges of both the black and white world throughout his entire life. We also learn midway through that he's gay, so he's struggled in that world as well.\n\nHe has a brilliant line midway through the movie when Tony mocks his aloofness and says, \"hey I'm blacker than YOU!\" Dr. Shirley gets out of the car in an utter downpour and yells, \"So if I'm not black enough, and if I'm not white enough, and if I'm not man enough, then tell me Tony, what am I?!\"\n\nClearly Shirley has been dealing with this conundrum his entire life, but he had never shown that vulnerability before. He is someone who seems to have it all figured out, but in reality, he's confused and alone. It was a true moment of revelation, and something you don't normally see in movies like this. Usually it's just wacky comic mayhem where the uptight character tries on silly clothes, some stupid hillbillies chasin' em in a truck, and then roll the end credits. Ali gave the charater of Dr. Shirley some serious depth and pathos I was definitely not expecting.\n\n3) Viggo Mortensen, as usual, was brilliant as well. He could have easily just done a DeNiro/Danza impersonation and \"hey oh, oh, eyyyd\" is way through this character, but he really was a joy to behold. Not only does he have some great laugh lines as the street-wise gambino, but you see his slow evolution from a guy who's just about as racist as the Southern hicks they come across, to seeing Dr. Shirley as who he is. A man. But never in a schmaltzy, schticky way.\n\nAnd in regards to him being the 'hero'....he was hardly a hero. His job was to protect Dr. Shirley in the south (because hey, a black man traveling alone in the deep south in the 60s, no matter how heroic he wanted to be, would be up against impossible odds, so Dr. Shirley did indeed need some help.) But even then, Tony did as little as possible through a good chunk of the movie to \"help\" Dr. Shirley. He 'tolerated' him for most of the time, and their friendship slowly developed, but was never over the top or 'heroic\". It was very subtle, and for that, I was grateful. I didn't need to be hit over the head with a message, or big crisis-fueled revelations. Watching these two characters grow to like each other, either through letter writing, listening to Little Richard, or the joys of eating fried chicken with your fingers... was a joy.\n\nThere weren't any real surprises in this movie, just a good story, VERY well told.\n\nI'd love for this to win the Best Picture as it was easily my favorite movie of the nominees...but I don't think it will.\n\nBut then again, stories like this aren't told for awards. They are told to make us smile, make us think, and make us better people.\n\nAnd Green Book accomplishes all three.",

It is still very relevant and topical for our generation as racism still exists, even if it is more behind closed doors.

When you think about the fact that this lost to Roma, is in the same club as films like Moonlight and even fared better than La La Land, Arrival and so many other deserving films, I'm only reminded of just how much of a joke \"award seasons\" can really be.\n\nI've read a lot of other reviews and it seems that a lot of people loved the feel-good moments. Well, good for you, but unfortunately I didn't think much of it was comedic or touching at all. Yet whatever else you may argue, you cannot tell me you didn't cringe a single bit watching that fried chicken scene. I mean, in the trailer it didn't seem that bad, but then you just get Viggo Mortensen forcing Mahershala Ali repeatedly as if the cool kid is being pressured to not look \"foolish\". What could have been decent and respectful comedy turned into something so uncomfortable for which Peter Farrelly should be utterly ashamed of. The worst part was that he then tells him he's not black enough? That turned my discomfort into anger. WTF were the writers thinking? \n\nPersonally, I want to make it clear that I'm the kind of guy who can forgive white-savior tropes where the film is well-written, filled with great performances, and yet still most importantly, doesn't cross the line. The Help and Hidden Figures are two examples of white-savior tropes which at least for me, managed to entertain and yet never went the offensive route. But this movie is just a whole different ball game. It's not only crossed the line but also manages to be a structural and technical mess. The first 30 minutes are really near useless,  and the story bumps around so many things to make it sound more complicated. It was like they were running through a checklist of themes they had to cover in different sections of the film to make it Oscar-worthy. There's black identity, isolation, dignity and social status, and then that ONE standalone scene on sexual identity, but they never come together under the hands of a director with no central vision. So what does he do to cover up his weaknesses? He puts together that touching ending to make us feel all good inside as we walk out the theater. The result is that even Mortensen and Ali's great performances were in my opinion heavily diminished to characters with character developments so misfired, unengaging and inconsistent.\n\nI'm not the most eloquent person, but I just needed some sort of medium to express my anger that such a film got made in the first place, and so I hope you get my point!",

It's an agreeable feel-good movie that tries to look past the heavier context and focus on the relationships and self-acceptance found in each character. The story is delivered with some exceptional cinematography and unforgettable chemistry. However, the fact that it won Best Picture in 2018 over more original movies is not something I would expect, as the story did not leave a lasting impression like other nominees in the category. While it doesn't offer up any real solutions for racial equality, Green Book still fits the bill for a solid family night movie. It's a story that is sure to entertain, even if it is just to sit back, smile, and watch an astounding performance of two grown men throwing chicken bones out of a moving car together.",

Their chemistry shines in each scene. There are times where they're just talking and you're captivated or caught smiling because of how well it all works. You like both guys. Their differences are very fun. Don is the one who is well read and has manners, yet he's looked down upon because of his race and Frank is kind of in the opposite boat. I also enjoyed Linda Cardellini (Dolores Vallelonga) in her smaller supporting role. The writing is very well done, as the characters are given strong moments to let their personalities shine and the dialogue is natural and sharp. There's a lot of charm to almost everything that happens.\n\nWeaknesses: There are some pacing issues here. Some scenes feel like they go on a bit long and others seem like they aren't needed. This could've been cut down to about 110 minutes and probably been tighter. I'm not big on Peter Farrelly as a director. None of his work has ever impressed me and I don't think he did anything to stand out in this one. It's shot in such a generic fashion that it's kind of just there.\n\nOverall: Should this have won Best Picture? No. Is it still a good movie? Absolutely. The writing is solid and I think the acting is fantastic, making for an enjoyable time.",

A loner, that's got a way with both words and manners as well as his piano skills. Back in the 1960's color was still a big matter in the US, and on this journey the two differently colored men get a taste of that.\n\nThis is a layered but extremely well directed and superbly written film. It's about differences, loneliness, hate, love, fried chicken, standing up for eachother and change, but most importantly it's about friendship.\n\nIt's cast is brilliant ant the performances are ace. This is a ride that never brings dull or unneeded moments and it's got that bright comedy tones all over and manage to never get silly or dumb. Sure, it's a bit oversentimental and easy to predict, but it works. Think of \"The Intouchables\" meeting \"Driving Miss Daisy\" or something. This is fun, this is safe, this is entertaining.\n\nI don't get the hate here. Sure, it's a bit controversial with the racial matter stuff, but I find it both important and pretty believeable.

            "content": "There was shock and outrage when this admittedly retrograde film took home the Best Picture statuette against more interesting, original and current films like Roma (2018) and The Favorite (2018). Particularly shocking is the fact that the film's director is Peter Farrelly, best known for gross-out comedies like Kingpin (1996) and The Three Stooges (2012), not exactly a Daldry or a Frears. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali had proven themselves to be Academy favorites in the past, Mortensen has received multiple nominations whilst Ali won for his work in 2016's Moonlight, but their pairing seemed unlikely. Despite all of this and early predictions that Roma would take the prize Green Book triumphed.\n\nTony \"the lip\" Vallellonga, Viggo Mortensen, is a racist Italian-American in 1950s New York City who is encouraged to question his prejudices when he begins working for educated African-American pianist Don Shirley, Mahershala Ali. Shirley needs a driver and bodyguard as he tours the Southern United States and he has been told that Vallellonga is the man for the job. Both will overcome their preconceptions of one another and learn a little something about themselves as they take a comedic road trip through a dangerous part of America. \n\nI quite liked the film, it was funny and charming and the performances of Mortensen, Ali and Linda Cardellini as Mrs. Vallellonga were very good but would I call it better than The Favorite? Well no. It's perfectly OK but it does employ the white savior trope that I hoped we had moved beyond with films like Moonlight (2016) and in the same year If Beale Street Could Talk (2018). It makes you question the demographic makeup of the Academy when a film like this, which would have been illuminating to some members of society in the late 1960s but 50 years later if you can't acknowledge that African-Americans have just as much to offer as white people you are racist not uninformed. It's nice that the highly accomplished actress Octavia Spencer is now an Academy award winning producer but it's saddening that this and The Help (2011), a worse white savior trope movie, are the films that she has been most rewarded for. \n\nIn short: this is a film that you don't really have to see, much like Darkest Hour (2017) just watching the trailer allows you to understand what the whole two hours will be like. Unless you're a Cardellini fan you can stay away.\n\nSome of the gags work really well with the fried chicken scene and the dropping of the cup eliciting a half smile but some of them fall flat like the pronunciation of Vallellonga gag, is it really that hard to pronounce? The gag that really worked for me was the card writing gag as we see Shirley composing romantic letters for Mrs. Vallellonga that she and her friends eagerly await. The card that means the most to her is the one written by her husband as he starts the letter with \"You remind me of a big house\" but follows this with \"Where the lights are always on and everybody is happy inside.\" His writing of this and her delighted response are very sweet and touching and although it is a very heavy-handed touch, like much of this film, it feels more genuine than most of the film.\n\nLinda Cardellini is quite lovely in this film as the reasonable wife who endeavors to bring her husband and Shirley closer together. She has a warmth and a sensibility to her that matches the description of the character and you are often left wondering how Vallellonga nabbed such a wonderful woman. Much like in The Founder (2016), a much better film, she is always a bright spot when she appears on screen and her sparing use leaves you wanting more of her. It is such a shame that the Daddy's Home franchise has become her meal ticket because she has real dramatic abilities and they would be put to use in better films.\n\nThis was not the best film of 2018 and I would not have even nominated it for Best Picture but of the nominated films I would have given the award to Roma because it is a technical marvel. Hopefully we can leave this sort of film behind and reward more interesting fare in the future.",

Dr. Don Shirley ( a talented, black, pianist of a more posh status) whom meets Tony when he applies for a job. A job that would change his life in thee best way possible. From the heart of Peter Farrelly comes friendship, hardships and life lessons. I love the ever growing bond between Dr. Shirley and Tony throughout the whole film. How Tony begins this story as a sceptic and a bit of a racist, ending in acceptance for this magnificent man and how he finally learns that skin colour is but a coating of a human being. It is not what defines us. And we are thrilled to see him realise this and come to terms with it. The dialogue is very clever! Cracking subtle and not so subtle jokes here and there keeps the audience breathless with laughter. The Green Book also brings our attention to racism in the 1930's. How such a simple thing as walking into a building could cost you your pride and dignity just for the colour of your skin. It also reflects to modern days and how there are still Tony's all around the world who are unable to accept people no matter their nationality or their origin.

It's a good movie overall but it's not something that's going to wow you or change your life when it comes to movies about 1960s racial relations. You really watch it to see these two great actors play their characters and interact to all situations differently. There is one extra twist here with one of the characters that I don't see much when it comes to these movies. It's basically a road trip through the \"Deep South\" in the 1960s with two men (one Italian American, one African American) with different education and upbringing but  they themselves are different in those worlds as well. Not a \"must see\" film but also does deserve it's academic praise. FINAL REVIEW: 7.5 out of 10",

The real story is the development of their relationship as the barriers of communication break down in their confrontations of obstacles on their own and together based on the paths they have chosen. Mahershala Ali (Dr. Don Shirley) and Viggo Mortenson (Tony Lip), each with an effortless Oscar-worthy genuineness, portray the characters in this true story - the unexpected intimacy between a highly educated, highly gifted gay African-American and a born and bred \u00e2family-style\u00e2? NYC cugino with a grammar school education. In the Q and A after the film, Farrell, Ali, and Mortenson shared my personal take away - the hope that the film will inspire an open dialogue for a \u00e2listening\u00e2(TM) relationship about racial and sexual prejudices that still exist today. The car metaphor demonstrates that we need to take the time to \u00e2listen\u00e2?. The film shows us that if people are informed they will do the right thing, and when they are not informed, they become hostages to their prejudices. Kris Bowers, composer, deserves grand applause.",

Evenly paced, it tells its story well and takes the audience along for the ride, never feeling either rushed or boringly slow. It is equally frustrating and heartwarming as these two men encounter the racism and bigotry of 1960s America, and at the same time come to a more individual understanding of each other.\n\nThe main problem I had with this movie is that it felt almost a bit clumsy at times, and it kept on using dialogue to tell instead of show. There is a lot of power in a film that leaves things unsaid, and this is not that film. It just felt a bit inelegant sometimes.\n\nThis is just me being picky, though. I guess I watched it through a 'should this have won Best Picture' lens. The other thing is that I suppose I expected that a movie like this, that just won Oscars, would have something new, interesting and/or monumental to say about racism. And it really doesn't. But what holds this film together is the friendship between these two men, and their own individual stories, more so than its commentary on the wider political situation.",

They rankle and irritate, an odd couple on wheels against the backdrop of a volatile social change, but through several close shaves and heated arguments, they develop a mutual admiration despite their fundamental differences.\n\nMostly a two-man show, Green Book thrives on the performances of Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali, who enrich twin roles that could have otherwise fallen into broad generalizations. The life and depth they bring to both individuals, and to their complicated friendship, make for more than just a standard morality play. It's also an impressively restrained turn for director Peter Farrelly, better known for his work with brother Bobby in a series of zany '90s comedies. He lets the tone set itself, resisting the urge to bludgeon us with the message, and sprinkles in a few solid laughs when the moment calls for it.

He's faced with a hard realization of the cruelty Ali's character has to live with every day and learns that when you're Black in the deep south, talent means absolutely nothing. His progression from racist thug to accepting and even defending Doc is tear inducing.\n\nDoc is played perfectly. Though he strikes you as snotty, you begin to understand why he's standoffish. As he becomes more comfortable with Tony, he let's his guard and begins to help Tony learn to speak, write, and carry himself better.\n\nThe two are incredible together because they both have lessons to learn. They both must grow, and the film does a wonderful job of showing that growth both personally and with relation to their friendship.\n\nThere are parts of the film that will be upsetting and you should be upset and outraged. There are parts of the film that are funny, and you should laugh.

Mahershala Ali got all the awards for his performance as Don Shirley and you can see why. They easily contracted each other in more than one ways. This helps to show that opposites really do attract in both friendships and relationships. Throughout the film, you can see both actors giving it their all in every scene they are in. Both characters in this film have character development that is perfect for their character. This is because both of them teach the other something and help them grow as a person. Whether it be Tony teaching Shirley how to loosen up a bit or Shirley teaching him how to write letters. This film isn\u00e2(TM)t afraid to show how in the 1960s racism was very prominent and how we still face that in this day and age. While watching this film you notice how things that happen back then still happen now and wonder why that is. Even though they do take this subject matter seriously like they should they also throw in a bit of humor in well-placed scenes that helps not take it away from the serious topic it\u00e2(TM)s dealing with. This film is two hours and ten minutes and you don\u00e2(TM)t feel it. Really even though I don\u00e2(TM)t say it that much I kinda wish it was a tiny bit longer. Nothing in this film felt rushed and felt at the speed it should be going at. There are a few scenes that I would\u00e2(TM)ve cut but not that many. In the end, this is a film that I think everybody should check out at least once. Whether just to learn about this interesting story about two friends who defied the odds or just a movie to watch.

The jazz pianist Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) is a high class Jamaican American and has a condo of many expensive furniture and antiques. The bouncer/driver Tony Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) is an Italian American and struggling to make money to support his family. He is a loud foul mouth, blunt, a chain smoker, and eats a lot. He even put himself in a bet in an eating competition to make some money. The plot follows Tony when he loses his job in a night club cause of renovation. He gets an interview from Dr. Don Shirley. Tony is a bit of a racist. When he sees two African Americans doing some plumbing work in his apartment and his wife Dolores (Linda Cardellini) serves them a drink. After they set their glasses in the sink. Tony grabs the glasses and throws them out in the trash. When Shirley recruits Tony to be his driver for this music tour. Which would set him away from his family for two months. Tony and Shirley will have a lot to go over about each other. Shirley is proper and mannered. Tony is the complete opposite. It is one of those heartfelt stories. Yes, it does have some difficult scenes to watch during the racial segregation when Don Shirley gets denied to use the whites bathroom or eat in a public restaurant with the rest of the people. Or when he is given a closet of a room to get ready for the concert. Sure, Tony does not take that likely and react poorly by knocking whoever is rude to the guy out. There is some character development with Tony and Don becoming friends throughout the movie and are able to tolerate each other. Don trying fast food restaurants with Tony. It is fun to see Tony and Don react to each other on screen. From being the people who can not stand one or another to being close friends throughout the road trip journey. Viggo Mortensen was great playing Tony. With the gaining weight for the role and an Italian accent. Mahershala Ali was also great playing Don Shirley who is prim and proper with his mannerisms. Linda Cardellini playing Tony's loving wife, who is set more aside on the screen time. Waiting at home and writing to her husband. Overall, Green Book is a really good film. It does have a heartfelt emotional true story about Tony and Don Shirley. It does have some fun humor that will make you laugh and some tough emotional moments. The performances are great.",

Yes, it is set in a time where racism was a major theme, but it\u2019s about friendship, fitting in and finding people to relate to. Mahershala Ali\u2019s character is really a man with no place to fit in outside his music. He\u2019s too \u201ccultured\u201d to fit in the black community, and, well, too black to fit in the white community. Viggo might fit into his family and those that love him, but he\u2019s a fish out of water in the \u201ctough guy\u201d Italian underworld his skills are suited for. This move is well written, excellently acted, and tells an important story of two misfits building a friendship. Movie of the year. Don\u2019t focus on the racism cliches.",

Travelling in the south, the pianist needs security and that's where Viggo comes in. Both actors have phenomenal performances and in my opinion, one of the most important elements to a fine movie : the ending. Which is hopeful, cathartic, feel-good, and inspiring. I truly enjoy this movie and if it wasn't for the predictability of the film and the stereotypes and delineation of the plot along those two basis's, I would have given it a perfect score. But the movie is choreographed and sometimes formulaic, especially in terms of character personalities. It's one of my favorites nonetheless and I think it's a minor criticism that would be almost impossible to avoid, following the story, but it is not the perfect plot to the perfect movie that I give a perfect rating for.",

Every scene more or less basically consists of a racist White man slowly finding out the harmful effects of racism but it never wants to go much deeper. There's a line where Don Shirley explains that he performs for white people to feel cultured but afterwards he's just another black man on the streets to them. And in a way, that kind of feels like what this film is. Lighthearted, easy themes for specific demographics of white people to feel involved in a conversation, but there are much more insightful conversations similar to this in a lot of recent African American made films that completely overshadow it.",
