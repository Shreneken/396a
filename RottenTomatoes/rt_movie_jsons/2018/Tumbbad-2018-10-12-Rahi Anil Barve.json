If you think you're watching a horror movie, the 40 minute mark will set you straight that you're watching a very mediocre movie that is wrapped up around mythology. And there's nothing scary about mythology even though story specifics can be shocking. \nNot horror. Not scary. Not even close. Mediocre but not horrible. Definitely not a waste of time if you're looking for something with a moral. \n\"Scary as hell\"…LOL…same fools who think mayonnaise is spicy think this movie is \"scary.\"",

            "content": "Would you believe me if I tell you the budget of this film is just 5 crores (nearly $700k)? Before you let that fact sink in, would you believe me if I also tell you that this is the director's first ever film? Rahi Anil Barve - remember this name. You might need to speak it when someone asks you who your favourite Bollywood director is. This film was made for 6 years. Keep reading, I will tell you why it took so long.\n\nTumbbad is set in the village of the same name in Maharashtra. The story is set during the colonial period, and also some of it just after the independence. Though the village exists in real, it is nothing like what has been described in the film. According to the film the village has been cursed for writing the name of Hastar, a demon son of a Goddess who gave birth to 160 million gods. Because of the curse it is always raining in Tumbbad. Since the budget of this film was so low, the filming was only done during monsoon season when it was actually raining in the village. That's how low the budget of the film is - they couldn't even afford fake rain so they had to wait for 6 years to complete the filming.\n\nIn spite of the low budget, it does not give the feeling of being cheap at all. In fact if I didn't know better, I'd think this is a very expensive film. The actors aren't popular, but I don't see where the problem is over there. How many of us knew the names of all the actors from Baahubali? Still we watched it, right? So I'd think this is also a regional film. The acting is phenomenal. The horror scenes absolutely give me the creeps. It's perfect in every sense. Even the ending is left on an ambiguous note, enough to leave a shrill down anyone's spine. The posters of this film are also very good, and it's a shame to say that the worst one has been used over here. Look up for the other posters on Google Images.\n\nThe reason why Tumbbad failed to cross a huge commercial mark is because it wasn't advertised at all. If I hadn't read an answer on Quora that said it should have been sent to the Oscars instead of Gully Boy, I'd have never even known about its existence. There was literally no talk of it. Sure it has a low budget for making the film, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't spend in the marketing at all. It was so awesome, I for one would have definitely seen it if I had heard about it before. Also the only way to watch it now is through Prime, which will show you this film only if you type the correct spelling in the search box. It's a shame that you can't watch this film unless you know specifically what you're looking for.\n\nI really admire the dedication of the director to make this film. He clearly knew this film wasn't going to be earning those big bucks, yet he continued to make it. This is what happens when you have directors who treat their work not as products but rather as works of art. I really aspire to be a filmmaker of that type. This film will be a very big lesson to me. I wish Rahi Anil Barve a very successful and prosperous career in the future.",

Excellent movie.  Please don't expect Tumbbad to be a jump-scare horror film it's not meant to be that, neither did it ever purport to be. Tumbbad is based on a Hindi fictional mythological type story set in Maharashtra in the 1918 to 1948 period post India independence.. The story spans three generations. The screenplay,  brilliant acting and lavish cinematography and story have created a small masterpiece.. \nNo expense was spared making this riveting film also a feast for the senses. The film is a chilling fantasy fable of greed across generations. The story traces the fortunes of a poor boy from a  small family who returns to his home, a bleak poverty stricken, cursed place, where a demon was once revered where it will always rain, called Tumbbad. The trailer doesn't do the film justice. The actual  story is chilling and it's  just brilliant.\n There are a few 'professional ' reviewers out there who have incorrectly  tried to compared Tumbbad to a typical Hollywood horror that they may have seen which it is not, neither ever purported to nor tries to be. Tumbbad is way better;  in a league and class  of its own.  I think Tumbbad will achieve cult status. Amazing Amazing Amazing! I  loved it!",

It's so refreshing to see a flick that cares about creative vision, intricate set designs, cinematography, and sound design. There's no big-budget star cast, no larger-than-life glittering sets, and no over the top music and dance sequences. Yet, Tumbbad manages to present a really skillful and perfect artwork on the screen that offers an absolutely fascinating visual and audible experience. It's a \"must-watch in the theaters only\" kind of film.\n\nI know a lot of people who're skeptical about it, thinking it's a horror film. But there's a stark difference between the typical horror stuff with jump scares that we're used to seeing, and what Tumbbad delivers. It's a 'Fantasy Horror' film, but one that's based on a powerful storyline with a primary theme of 'greed'. It won't leave you looking over your shoulder once you step out of the theatre and around the corners at home, it just isn't your exorcism and \"bhoot-preyt\" kind of horror. What it is, is thrilling, gripping, and surreal.\n\nLastly, one of my favorite parts of the film is its background score by Jesper Kyd. Tumbbad is scored by Jesper Kyd - the same man behind the popular games like the Hitman series, Assassin's Creed series, Borderlands series, Darksiders II and State of Decay. His music is what brings the film to life in the theater.",

Tumbbad shows us what we might have been missing, and in unforgettable fashion. It is terrifying, surprising and utterly unique.
