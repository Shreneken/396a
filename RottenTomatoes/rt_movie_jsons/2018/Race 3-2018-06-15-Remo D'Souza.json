            "content": "One word for the writer. Why? This movie kills the hard work of Sir Issac Newton in every 5 seconds of this goddamn film. This film has cheesy graphics and acting. And I have only begun, the storyline of this film cannot be described in words without any exaggeration. First, Salman Khan is not human in this film, he is still carrying those powers from 'God Tussi Great Ho' (for the love of God please don't see that film either.) he is defying Physics and death here. Then comes Anil Kapoor and Co. I am not lying when I say this, the rest of the characters were so boring you could only laugh at the CGI and stunts while not paying any attention to anyone except 'Bhai'. Overall, I say this movie is cruel and unusual and no one deserves this kind of punishment.",

            "content": "Race 3 was released on 15th June 2018 and is a thriller film directed by Remo D'Souza and produced under Tips Films and Salman Khan films. It is distributed by Tips films, Salman Khan Films, and Yash Raj Films. This film is considered to be a reboot to the race franchise. Although it has a sparsely related plot to the previous film. This film stars Anil Kapoor and Jacqueline Fernandez who have previously performed in this franchise and Salman Khan Bobby Deol, Saqib Saleem, and Daisy Shah as the new entrants in the franchise. This is the presently last and the worst part in my view in the whole franchise and I primarily think that the failure of this film is due to Salman Khan because he interferes in every sphere of filmmaking whether it be the direction or it is a screenplay. The story has become a thing of past in Salman Khan films and as I say that story is the core of any movie and so I give this film a very negative rating. This film lags in the storyline as well as in the presentation too. individual performances of actors are fine and the music is also average. I don't advise my readers to watch this movie as it could lead to severe headaches.",

This movie is easily the worst in the franchise and one of the worst examples of Indian cinema. The action scenes in the movie are entertainingly ludicrous but there are only two worth mentioning and they even aren't that good, since the story at no point gave me any reason to care. A vast majority of this movie is a total snoozefest. I didn't like any of the characters nor did care about the overly convoluted and silly storylines. I was so painfully bored by this movie that I am amazed I even managed to get through its nearly three-hour runtime. The acting is also pretty bad in the movie, but part of the fault has to be given to the laughably bad dialogue. This movie has a couple of decently made action scenes and a good looking cast but absolutely nothing else. Go and rewatch the first \"Race\" movie instead of wasting your time sitting through this thing. This just might be the worst movie I have seen in 2018.",

Somehow I passed those two plus hours. except Anil kappor all looked like charity cast and were in movie as Bhai wanted them to be. Bobby deol was decent but story was rubbish with almost no surprises. In the very beginning you know all twists of the movie as every thing was copied from earlier parts. First two parts with saif ali khan also had luxury of having strong antagonist  like cunning Akshay khanna and tough John Abraham. Here it seemed Salman himself chose the rest of the cast only to make himself look far better from beginning and so that no one should ever root for the villain. When someone takes audience for granted as he has some crazy fans  the results are  tiger zinda hai and Race 3 like movies. Worst stuff was the flying sequences where it seemed that they wanted to make a superman movie leaving all factors of wingsuits aside.",
