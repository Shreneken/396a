It's not unwatchable, but for most of the part especially in the second half, it's just too boring. Watch it only if you must.",

His character is very likable has he only has the purest intentions to something good for society. The story was inspirational and pretty well put together. I do feel that the first half of the movie dragged mostly because it became pretty repetitive and it probably could have been cut a bit shorter. The movie does bounce back with a fast-paced and resonant second half that makes the movie worthwhile. It's a good movie with a strong message and a good heart that I enjoyed.",

To make a commercially viable movie on such a sensitive topic, it took a bold risk from King Kumar ( I think he's the best mainstream actor we have in India after Amitabh Bachhan) and the director R. Balki. \n\nThe movie has a brisk pace and doesn't deviate from the crux and in fact goes on to add more dimensions in its second half. All in all it's a brilliant movie and the landscape shown in the movie deserves special applause. While I knew Madhya Pradesh is that picturesque I am glad it was showcased even more beautifully.",

It's able to cover a sensitive subject with grace, Kudos to the film crew on picking up a topic, which while natural is still considered a taboo in our society. The movie is about a mans obsession in making a cheap sanitary pad.\n\nThe first half of the movie is on the trial and error of the first try at making a pad, the embarrassment and social ostracism our protagonist goes through.\n\nThe second half is about him reaching his goal and going a leap forward in taking it to the world. The joy of making a perfect product, popularizing it across villages and getting reorganized for it makes it's a cheerful watch. The addition of some great dialogues and humor only add to the watching experience. \n \nThe performances across the board were perfect, Akshay Kumar shines in his portrayal of goal obsessed manic, Radhika Apte is the perfect image of a rural housewife still stuck with its traditional beliefs & Sonam Kapoor is a breath of fresh air with her urban sensibility. \n\nPS: The movie is based on the short story The Sanitary Man of Sacred Land in Twinkle Khanna's book The Legend of Lakshmi Prasad, which is inspired by the life of Arunachalam Muruganantham, a social activist from Tamil Nadu.",
