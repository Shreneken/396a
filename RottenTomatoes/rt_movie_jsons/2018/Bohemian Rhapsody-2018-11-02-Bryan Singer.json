            "content": "Bohemian Rhapsody was an interesting emotional movie. The story isn't 100% accurate but that didn't badder me too much. I think it was done this way to attract those who don't know Queen and it's history. The movie is a bit slow around the end of the first hour, but it does pickup after that. The Live Aid show is really full of emotions and energy. Love it. The acting is relatively solid. Rami Malek just carry this movie. His performance is amazing. The movie doesn't fall into scenes of debauchery and sex. It is mostly alluded. The music is great but not really presented in a chronological order. I give it 78%. I had a good time watching the movie, even if the middle section wasn't that engaging.",

            "content": "\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" (2018) for you. The film is a musical/drama directed by Bryan Singer and tells the story of the legendary British rock band, Queen, and its lead singer, Freddie Mercury. The film follows Freddie's rise to fame, his struggles with his sexuality, and the band's journey to become one of the most iconic musical acts of all time.\n\nOne of the biggest strengths of the film is the performances of the cast, particularly Rami Malek, who plays Freddie Mercury. Malek delivers an outstanding performance, capturing the essence of Freddie's flamboyant personality and his unique singing style. The supporting cast, including Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy, and Joseph Mazzello, also deliver strong performances, bringing the rest of the band to life on screen.\n\nThe film's cinematography is also excellent, capturing the energy and spectacle of Queen's performances on stage. The movie's music is, of course, another standout aspect, featuring some of the band's most iconic songs such as \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" \"We Will Rock You,\" and \"Another One Bites the Dust.\" The film's use of music also helps to capture the emotion and energy of the band's journey.\n\nOn the negative side, the film's plot can feel a bit formulaic at times. The film follows a standard biopic structure, hitting all of the expected beats of a rock 'n' roll movie. Some of the characterizations also feel a bit shallow, particularly of Freddie's bandmates who are not given as much depth as they could have been.\n\nFurthermore, some of the facts of the film are not entirely accurate, which can be frustrating for fans of Queen who are familiar with the band's history. However, this is to be expected to some degree in any biopic, as the filmmakers have to take some creative liberties to tell a compelling story.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" is a highly entertaining film that captures the spirit of Queen and its iconic lead singer. While it may not be the most groundbreaking or original movie, it is certainly worth watching for its excellent performances, music, and cinematography. Whether you're a fan of Queen or just looking for an enjoyable musical drama, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" is a movie that will not disappoint.",

The constant use of Queen's music keeps things energetic, and the final twenty minutes are some of the best I've ever seen in a movie. Overall, Bohemian Rhapsody is a must-watch for fans of Queen, Freddie Mercury, or just music in general. Whether you're a diehard fan or just want to learn more about one of the greatest rock bands of all time, this film is sure to satisfy.",

            "content": "\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" is really more about Queen the band rather than just the more interesting story of their flamboyant frontman. The story begins in 1970. Freddie ( Rami Malek ) is a regular attendee to live gigs and after a chance meeting with the rather bland but talented rock band Smile, he talks himself into being their new frontman.\n\nThe main issue the film has, is the lack of drama that was present during the meteoric rise to fame of the band Smile after both the change of frontman and name change to Queen. Freddie's story is completely different with a fascinating, deeply moving history that has more than enough drama and emotion to carry the film without sharing equally the screen time with the rest of the band. \u00a0Malek is outstanding as Freddie and totally believable as the self destructive star. Despite the lack of substance in the storytelling of the band it is full of their greatest hits particularly during recording sessions and song writing moments. However it is the focus on Freddie that steals the limelight and although \" Bohemian Rhapsody\" plays any sexuality issues and H.I.V. rather too briefly and quite safe, his mental torment and the demons he was battling with are portrayed brilliantly by Malek. \u00a0\n\n\" Bohemian Rhapsody's \" closing act has Queen reforming, after a brief hiatus, to take part in the Live Aid Concert in 1985. These scenes are recreated with such visual excitement that the film elevates to a much higher level than anything previous. Malek reproduces very accurately the flamboyance, energy and charisma that oozed out of Freddie when he stole the show during that memorable concert. It's here the film ends, with Queen being hailed as the band that produced the best performance of the concert despite the who's who of artists and bands that took to the stage.\u00a0\n\nFreddie's story would continue however for a further six years and it's quite a loss not to include these very important years. However \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" is an entertaining movie with an extremely memorable performance from the very talented Rami Malek.",

Freddie's undoubted charisma comes across quite well on screen. Of course there's the fact that (as some critics/others have mentioned) some (sexual related) details were glossed over, shall I say, which I believe was mainly done to allow the film to get the lower 12 rating, rather than a 15. I wouldn't say it entirely detracted from the film - it is perhaps a little sanitised, perhaps there's an element of artificiality about it, a bit but the film is still a decent, pretty solid film regardless. There are some witty lines of dialogue and I enjoyed seeing the group (Queen, obviously) rise in popularity and how Freddie got on (or not) with the other band members and the like. \n\nThis is a fun film to watch if you want to have a bit of a sing along and its intriguing in terms of the plot. I like Queens music but I can't say I knew much about the history of the group, so I found this both an entertaining and an insightful film. How true it is to the history of the group, I can't really say but as a film itself, its a decent watch and so I'd recommend it on that basis (rock on!!).",

It's like he got into his skin and became him. Not only does he look like him, but he has all his mannerisms. It's insane. It's crazy how much Freddie got ridiculed for his big teeth. It didn't matter to him though, he used it as fuel and internalized it into confidence. He was born to be a frontman, a performer, and destined to be one of the most iconic and greatest voices in rock history. Really cool to see how creative they were to experiment with sound in the studio when they were recording their first song. Wow, the actress that plays Freddie's girlfriend is beautiful. Oh wow the actor who plays Little Finger in GOT is their manager! I love how Mike Myers taps into his Fat Bastard character for his role in this movie as the crabby record company headman. I love how Bohemian Rhapsody was a tune that echoed in Freddie's head, he felt a strong connection with the melody he came up with. It was almost like something spiritual in nature that was being gifted to him.\n\nIt's kind of a treat getting to see a glimpse into Freddie's personal life. Seeing how David Munns kind of led Freddie down the wrong path whilst manipulating him was something I had no idea happened in Freddie's life. How petty and disgusting of him to go on national television and spill all of Freddie's secrets and personal life like he did, what a trashy human being. I'm glad Freddie was able to move past that phase in his life and throw him out like yesterdays trash, but of course it wouldn't have been possible if it wasn't for Mary who woke him up quite literally and then made him realize everything.\n\nIt's so inspirational to see how much of a positive impact Queen has made on the world, and especially seeing how much money they raked in during their performing at Live Aid was insane. I love how Mary, even through all the ups and downs with Freddie, still was a part of Freddie's life, always there supporting him. I thought that was beautiful, I feel like we could all use a loyal and wonderful friend like Mary in our lives. \n\nThe movie's got a good sense of humor. The pacing is wonderful. The story is told beautifully with elegance. Filmed with a deft eye and a keen sense to detail, style and aesthetic. It all looks wonderful. The movie really pulled me in and kept me entertained. That's what I want, what I need from a movie.\n\nWhat a wonderful movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it, all of it. An unexpectedly inspiring and uplifting movie, I wasn't ready for all the emotions and feels it offered. There were definitely a couple of moments where I teared up either out of joy or excitement. The only problem I have with this movie is that I wish they showed the final years of Freddie. It was almost like they were trying to avoid showing as much of that part of Freddie's life as possible. Which I get it, there's nothing really happy or uplifting about it, but it was definitely an integral part of his life as well. It felt like the producers were scared of showing that side because it would have maybe darkened up the already exciting and inspiring tone that they established throughout the movie. But in fact it could have elevated it to the next level. There's nothing wrong in showing the dark side of life and people just as long as its done with taste and good style. Overall, I'd watch this movie again sometime and I definitely recommend it to everyone.",

They had some iconic songs (namely \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\" and \"Don't Stop Me Now\") and Freddie Mercury's immediately recognisable vocals and Brian May's virtuosic guitar playing were always out of this world.\n\n'Bohemian Rhapsody' fascinated me when hearing about it and became most of my most anticipated films for the year. When hearing some negativity for the film, my expectations lowered a little, but saw it anyway because it did look and sound good. It did turn out to be a good decision, it is good to see that others here loved it and don't agree with the mixed critical reception respectfully.\n\nSure there are clich\u00e9s (such as what some of the rest of Queen say) , but very few films are not and many are much worse in this regard. Like a lot of biopics, there are inaccuracies that may drive die-hard Queen fans into a frenzy, and the odd factual distortion, but again 'Bohemian Rhapsody' is not the first or worst film to do this and am going to judge it as a film on its own and not on a documentary level.\n\nAs a film on its own terms, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' has an awful lot to admire. Getting the issues out of the way, the ones that could have been handled much better was the with the revelation of Freddie Mercury's AIDs diagnosis to the rest of the band, could have been done with more tact and less crass (like saying what it was a consequence of) and revealed too early and at the wrong time, and the implications with the phone ringing off post-taking centre stage that the event was a flop when it actually was a triumph.\n\nSome of the early parts were a touch rushed as well, Mercury's ascent to stardom could have been less breakneck.\n\nHowever, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' is stylishly film and evokes the period beautifully. As to be expected, the songs are incredible and will be embedded in your brain for a long time, then again it is Queen of course. They are affectionately staged and performed in a way that made me remember what made me appreciate Queen in the first place.\n\nDidn't find the script that simplistic or cliff-notes like, while there is a nice mix of moment of laughter, tension and tears and enough parts that entertained and informed, if not as in depth as it should. The story is never dull and the Live Aid depiction is both rousing and poignant. It's capably directed and while all the performances are fine if underused, it is Rami Malek's outstanding turn as Mercury that will live long in the memory, true to what made Mercury so interesting a person and performer without being an impersonation.\n\nConcluding, impressively done and better than anticipated. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

All this is in the details and you just want to believe what you see. It's also easy to get sentimental with a final that is kind of magic. This is all perfect. However, with just over two hours the film isn't too long, and could have dwelled more on and not just skip why and how Farrokh Bulsara became Freddie Mercury, what made him into one of the greatest stage personas, pop legends and composers of all time. Sadly the first part of the film jumps too easily over this pivotal question, and it basically continues to be unsettled throughout the film. Also the other band members and some of the most crucial people around Queen or the band's leading performer are one dimensional. The directors don't manage to show us the whole human and fully grasp the intensity of what recognized Freddie Mercury. It is a lot to dive into, but without this the portrait is too shallow and the film fails to become as legendary as the man it wants to paint a biographical picture of.

The adaption of the Live Aid performance is AWESOME. I actually like the movie version more than the original. They made it almost perfectly synchronized to the original version, with the movement etc.\nABSOLUTE MUST SEE!!!!!\nPS: I hope there is coming a sequel :)",

Or take inspiration for how energised and on-board they are with his creative direction?\n\nThe film flirts with the underlying tragedy of his private life and the illness that inevitably claims his life, but keeps it at arm's length to prevent the audience from getting sad when there's rock music to enjoy.\n\nSo it's a good film but not an excellent one. Rami Malek is astonishing though, without question.",

Why does this movie have auto tune and lip syncing over the original recordings and not new recordings by Rami Malek unlike Taron Edgerton in Rocketman. I think it is really funny that the members of Queen get mad because they have to lip sync on tv but then they lip synced all the singing in this movie. The editing in this movie is terrible. How did this movie win an Oscar for best editing? I do not understand. They always say that Freddie is drunk or high but they never show him getting drunk or high, unlike\u00a0Rocketman. The best way to describe it is that this movie is very sanitized and safe. The movie doesn't go into the real side of Freddie at all. The movie is also not factually accurate. Freddie got diagnosed with AIDS in 1987 but in the movie he gets diagnosed before the Live Aid concert which was in 1985. Rami Malek's performance is pretty good though. I liked the lawyer/manager character. The music is great but that has nothing to do with this movie. I do really like the Live Aid scenes though. The Live Aid scenes are definitely the best part of the movie hands down. I just find the Live Aid concert really cool and fascinating. I also believe Live Aid was probably the best concert ever. The story, being a true story is pretty interesting so I liked the story told in the movie. In conclusion, John Reid is a terrible person, lip syncing is bad, this movie is disappointing and mediocre but not the worst movie ever by any means and Rocketman\u00a0is way better.\u00a0I will say Rocketman\u00a0is so much better, it's not even a competition.

For example, Freddie didn't meet the other band members behind a van after their show; they were already roommates. There was no backlash against the Bohemian Rhapsody song; everyone loved it at the start. The band wasn't inspired to perform at Live Aid by Freddie's courage in the face of AIDS; he wasn't diagnosed with that until two years after that show. \nThe movie at all times is heading towards that Live Aid performance, which was recreated shot for shot with the original footage.

Maybe apart from Freddie Mercury the story of the band is actually not that interesting- certainly the script and direction suggest that. The Live Aid segment was way too long, and the manager pushing the sound faders up to 11 surely didn't happen, plus the close-up shots of the crowd were embarrassing. Chronologically I doubt Freddie told the band he had AIDS just before going on stage at Live Aid, and the shots of the new boyfriend and ex girlfriend gurning from the wings were unconvincing. The songs of course are terrific but not enough to hang this overlong movie onto.",

            "content": "\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" is a foot-stomping celebration of Queen, their music and their extraordinary lead singer Freddie Mercury. Freddie defied stereotypes and shattered convention to become one of the most beloved entertainers on the planet. The film traces the meteoric rise of the band through their iconic songs and revolutionary sound. They reach unparalleled success, but in an unexpected turn Freddie, surrounded by darker influences, shuns Queen in pursuit of his solo career. Having suffered greatly without the collaboration of Queen, Freddie manages to reunite with his bandmates just in time for Live Aid. While bravely facing a recent AIDS diagnosis, Freddie leads the band in one of the greatest performances in the history of rock music. Queen cements a legacy that continues to inspire outsiders, dreamers and music lovers to this day.\n\nIt received mixed reviews from critics; while Singer's direction, portrayal of Mercury's sexuality and lives of the other band members were criticized, Malek's performance and the music sequences received praise. The film also contains a number of historical inaccuracies. It became a major box office success, grossing over $903 million worldwide on a production budget of about $50 million, becoming the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2018 worldwide and setting the all-time box office records for the biopic and drama genres. \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" received numerous accolades, including a leading four wins at the 91st Academy Awards for Best Actor (Malek), Best Film Editing, Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing; it was also nominated for Best Picture. The film also won Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama at the 76th Golden Globe Awards, and was nominated for the Producers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture and BAFTA Award for Best British Film, while Malek won the Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild and BAFTA for Best Actor. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads: \"Bohemian Rhapsody hits a handful of high notes, but as an in-depth look at a beloved band, it offers more of a medley than a true greatest hits collection.\" Owen Gleiberman of Variety wrote: \"Rami Malek does a commanding job of channeling Freddie Mercury's flamboyant rock-god bravura, but Bryan Singer's middle-of-the-road Queen biopic rarely lives up to the authenticity of its lead performance.\" Paul Whitington, writing for the Irish Independent, gave the film 3/5 stars, saying: \"Bohemian Rhapsody is not big on subtlety: it tells Freddie's story loudly, taking dramatic shortcuts, over-neatly conflating events and reducing most of the surrounding characters to single dimensions. Some of the dialogue's a bit heavy-handed too, but I must say I was thoroughly entertained.\"\n\nThe first LP record I bought in my life for my B-Day money in 1980 at the age of 8 was the soundtrack to \"Flash Gordon\" by Queen. The impact Queen had on me at that point was enourmous. Queen was the first band I found on my own and loved. With that said, Queen has a special place in my heart. I like the fact that this film is so well made and created as a proper tribute to one of the best leading men in rock ever lived. Freddie Mercury was unique and I don\u00b4t think anyone would say omething different. Rami Malek is uncanny as Freddie at times in this film and it\u00b4s nicely made for being a bio-pic even if it is a bit wobbly in certain areas for my taste. And, it\u00b4s also a film that lives a bit alongside reality and as said it does have several historical inaccuracies. Nevertheless, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" is well worth a watch.",

Sure, those are great, but the music wasn't written for the film; it's independent from the movie's quality.  Malek's performance was exceptional, but he can only do so much to prop up the film.  It doesn't help that he didn't do his own singing.  Take Rocketman, a similar type of biopic.  That film couldn't have been about any other artist than Elton John, it was so personal to the person it was depicting with a great, deep message.  Bohemian Rhapsody's message is the generic, shallow \"be yourself\", which is no different from the thousands of other films with the same theme.  Overall, that's all I can say about Bohemian Rhapsody, shallow, generic, and market tested",

Some of us cried for/with a song because it accentuates the feeling of a moment/experience/memory... I have...

With bandmates Brian May and Roger Taylor themselves working closely with the producers of the film, you know it must be pretty accurate to how it happened. The actors portrayal of the rock stars is uncanny. Watching side by side videos of actual footage vs. the movie, it is remarkable how well they recreated such an important time in the history of rock and roll. \n\nThis film tells the story of legendary rock band, Queen. They are well known all over the world to this day for their musicianship as well as their late lead singer, Freddie Mercury. Mercury's life seemed to be in the public eye for all to see, but in this film you see a side of him you've never seen before. You learn the secrets behind their hits, you learn about the bond the band had, their downfall, their revival. It's fascinating to see. The movie takes you through the bands entire musical career from the very beginning, up until Live Aid. You get to see how the band forms, their musical evolution. You learn more about their recording techniques than ever before and you're able to see exactly what influenced their music. You meet Mary Austin, the love of Mercury's life, Paul Prenter, the villain, and Jim Hutton, his partner until he passed away. You meet the bands very first producers and managers, their long time manager \"Miami\" Beach, as well as some not so cooperative record labels who doubted their more musically diverse tracks like \"Bohemian Rhapsody\". Speaking of, so much of the \"crazy\" writing that redefined rock and roll is explained. You see tracks through the writing process, start to finish. The film also shows what was going on behind the scenes for Mercury. From his realization of his sexuality, to testing HIV positive, we see what he was truly going through. One of my very favorite parts of the film is the Live Aid performance. From the music to the realistic look of the crowd, you feel like you are there watching it live. The emotion in the arena is indescribable and you can feel it through the screen. The film is well researched and incredibly accurate, as I have done some fact checking. You will love this film whether you are a Queen fan or not. It is more than a bio-epic, it's a story about real people. The revolutionary band that we all know and love, on screen in their prime decade later. What more could we ask for? This movie is worth your time, it's the kind of film you can watch time and time again and catch something new every time. I would recommend this film to anyone and everyone within the PG-13 rating. This is an absolute must see and arguably THE movie of 2018! Grab some popcorn and your old Queen t-shirt and get ready to shed a few tears, sing along, and smile a whole lot!",

Also of interest is the band's relationship with Ray Foster (Mike Myers), an EMI executive who hated their classic song Bohemian Rhapsody, and Paul Prenter (Allen Leech), Mercury's personal manager and lover. Culminating with the 1985 Live Aid charity concert held in part at Wembley Stadium in London. Mercury reunited with his former queen band-mates to perform some of their greatest hits, and eventually Bohemian Rhapsody again reaching number one on the radio charts as Freddie Mercury succumbed to HIV/AIDS and died. Although being far from perfect, it does showcase the triumphs and some failures of one of the greatest Rock n' Roll bands that ever existed.",

Timeline of some events was changed for theatrical effect.\n\nGood.\n\nBut the movie never feels that any of the characters have the struggle to overcome. Freddie Mercury joins the band 15 minutes in and he's an instant celebrity. The rest of the movie is about his celebrity status with his band in the background.\n\nWhere is the conflict?\n\nI'm sure that the longest argument in the movie lasts only 2 minutes before they give in to Freddie Mercury. He resolves a long issue with his parents with a quick introduction of his boyfriend. His antagonist gives him up with ease. Everyone, in the end, agrees with Freddie.\n\nThe band never faces a real crisis and everyone gets back together without fighting. Exciting.\n\nEven the antagonist doesn't give a convincing performance. His evolution is not understood or shown in the movie.\n\nThe ending is ok but doesn't make sense.\n\n2.5/5. I know these music biopics are never good but I keep watching them. Am I a sucker for pain?",

I feel that a lot of Mercury's life should've been fleshed out more and delved into deeper, beginning from his childhood onward.

This is a rare instance where a lengthier runtime would've benefited the film in many ways.\n\nIt was a GOOD experience to say the least, but it never realized its full potential.

Rami Malek's performance was amazing but I felt the movie a little slow\". I know this is MY opinion but I kind of agree. This movie starts with so much enthusiasm, Freddie meets the band, they make their first show, they have their first tour. And everything happens so fast!! But in the beginning it kinda WORKS!!! Then they make bohemian rhapsody and then another tour and then apparently another one and another one??? Yeah, I got a little confused. And then the same things narrated in a STRANGE way and  they ALSO tell the story about Freddie's an Mary's complicated relationship. Then we fast for-ward to 1984, that's when the drama continues talking about all the addictions of Freddie, the problems of his sexuality and relationship with Mary. For me this second act REALLY stands out, and Rami Malek's performance gets more serious and better.\nThe way they use the music as a tool of narration gives a second insight of the songs from the view of Freddie Mercury.\nI think it gives a good satisfying ending but as a Queen fan I'm IN LOVE with the recreation of 1985's Live Aid and the full version that comes in the Blu-Ray.\nAnd about Rami Malek's performance it is outstandingly unbelievable. I have a very clear mental image about Freddie Mercury, but watching Rami Malek I forgot for a moment who the real Freddie was, I simply was watching Freddie which is unbelievable.\nHearing the soundtrack it didn't make sense anymore in my head, How was Rami Malek singing so deep? But watching the movie and Rami act I don't even think about it.\nI think the reason why some people perceive it a little slow it's because the movie shows the origins of Queen and how they got famous AND the private life of Freddie, Then in the second act in 1984 it is how the band is doing and a deeper look at Freddie Mercury's life, so it is actually really a lot but it's still not so long that any teenager or Adult will watch it complete, so it doesn't feel really slow.\nIt is a great movie everyone should watch, even if your not a Queen fan you will enjoy it.",

Rami Malek as the lightning-in-a-bottle talent of Freddie Mercury was much better than I had expected (even though he won the Oscar for his portrayal) and he largely carried this movie from start to finish. I suppose my expectations were low considering Bohemian Rhapsody also won Best Film Editing, an award that was famously eviscerated on the internet immediately thereafter. And let me tell you, the \"pitch\" scene that made its rounds on social media is as bad as it came off during the wave of criticism and almost gave me motion sickness. Moreover, why on Earth would Queen need to pitch themselves to Little Finger (Aidan Gillen)? It takes about 6 seconds to know that Mercury was a generational, if not centurational (?), talent. Sometimes the pacing was strange and the band didn't seem to have the issues typically associated with rock bands. Maybe this was accurate, which is fine, but sometimes they almost seemed to finish each other's sentences and it came off as corny. Lucy Boynton as Mary deserved an Oscar for having the world's worst on-screen gaydar. The LiveAid ending was a lovely touch, even if it didn't have the personal significance to Freddie in real life as it had in the film. Basically, this is a fun movie that had taken \u2014 like usual \u2014 plenty of liberties with historical accuracy to make an overall enjoyable film. Oh, and there were numerous cats that occupied Freddie's home throughout and they all receive 100/100s, 10 gold stars, of course.",

It spends too much time trying to dig the tears out of us that we don't get to see the true fall of Freddie. I also wish the film included more musical elements, but that wasn't their goal so overall the music they did have was nice.

I probably watched it a few times since I had not seen it from the beginning before committing to loving the movie. The more I watch it, the more I love this movie.  Needless to say, I love Bohemian Rhapsody.  Throughout my life, I would quote Queen songs, Another bites the dust when yet another employee quit; We are the Champions, when we were out drinking; Under Pressure; Crazy Little Thing Called Love because these were simply beautiful songs; I quoted Queen, but I never bought or followed Queen.  Why? I don't know, other than I assumed they were too heavy metal.  \n\nThey did an amazing job telling the story of Freddie Mercury and Queen.  It was tasteful, not too much foul language or inappropriate s*x scenes.  Just a great story. Now, I'm a huge Freddie Mercury fan.  I wished he was not dead. He was Sugar in Milk.  He added sweetness to England.  His glitz, the four extra teeth was his gift (Pastor Steven Furtick).  It chronicled his life and legacy in a beautiful, respectful manner.    It shows his rise to fame, and when you are not careful, mindful, searching, fruit flies, as Freddie calls them, I call him a demon, who led Freddie to the path of hell.  Is that guy, Paul, dead and burning in hell?  \n\nExcellent casting.  I could not tell the difference between the real band members and the actors.  Loved Bryan May and Miami Beach.  They were his best friends and his angels.  Freddie was blessed to have them in his life.  And John and Roger were his buddies.  Queen was not only musically talented but brilliant minds.  Very impressive story.  \n\nI am still examining the amazing life of dear Freddie Mercury.  I wish he was still alive.  I'm sorry that he was so lonely and lost his way.  I learned how to be a better person by watching the life of Freddie.  And everyone should watch, so they can watch out for fruit flies.  \n\nThe entire movie had great lines, great scenes, great lessons.  But my favorite part of the movie, was how they filmed the making of Bohemian Rhapsody.  And I simply loved, the respect and exchange between Freddie and Brian - when Brian so humbly said, \"no. no, I love it...\"  and Freddy complimented him on his near perfect guitar playing.  Brian was like Freddie's older brother, and true friend.  \n\nOUTSTANDING MOVIE...I now own the movie and the soundtrack...and still examining the life of one of the most fascinating people that ever existed, Freddie Mercury.  It's part of my Top Ten.\n\nThe last thing I was to comment on, is Freddie's private life.  Freddie was PRIVATE about his private life, as it should be.  The movie accurately respected his privacy.  It was very tasteful.  We got the idea.  It was clear.  We don't need an X-rated version of this most magnificent person.",

It will always be a missed opportunity.\n\nLet's concede that Rami Malek was able to ape Freddie Mercury to the absolute letter -- in fact his performance is in some ways made greater by its standing as the uncontested greatest attribute within an otherwise very intentionally compromised story. Because ultimately, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" is not a product reflective of Queen's gritty and hard-hitting era, but instead fully embraces today's high sheen, honesty-be-damned times. And it just didn't have to be that way. Even the film's bolder aspirations are squashed by unnecessary interference from awkward depictions of untruthful shortcuts designed to placate a mass audience. Take the oft-heralded recreation of the band's legendary set at LiveAid: Indeed, so much care is taken to get that right, including the admirably un-Hollywood risk of reproducing that performance in full. Yet their set isn't actually left to play out in its consuming glory as advertised; instead, it's shamelessly intercut with goofball images of a phone bank in which LiveAid organizer Bob Geldolf glumly looks over a group of customer service reps with phones that at one moment are silent, but within seconds of Queen's set begin ringing triumphantly en masse. The sad insinuation is made that no other acts were able to solicit phone calls until Queen went on, and that once they did, viewers readily interrupted their own consumptions of the performance to desperately make 1-800-calls in real-time (!). \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" is filled with many such patronizing and irresponsible creative decisions.\n\nQueen's trust and estate has surely bankrolled from \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" as a film, and as a catalyst for sparking renewed interest in the band's catalog and continued live performances. But in terms of legacy, the choices here feel terribly thin and short-sighted. Here's hoping that at end-of-life, the members of Queen who outlasted Mercury won't be consumed by the existential regret of having documented their band's legitimate glory with this distorted and saccharine veneer of their well-earned lives.",

Disappointing start to finish.\n\nIt's surprisingly quite tame for what claims to be a Queen biopic (will get to that later). There are sex and drugs implied along with heavy partying but nothing too much. Swearing is words like sh*t damn, hell, and one F bomb quietly thrown in, but are infrequent. \nNow on to the review itself, as a hardcore Freddie and Queen fan was highly disappointed. The movie was grossly inaccurate, mostly in its portrayal of Freddie himself. The movie claims to be a Queen biopic but then instead chooses to  focus solely on Freddie with his band mates being pushed to the background. But then if it were choosing to be a Freddie Mercury biopic, it leaves out probably the most important aspects of his life such as his collaborations with Montserrat Caball\u00e9, Micheal Jackson, and of course David Bowie. (He did do a fantastic opera for a bit in his later years!) Also brushes over his sexuality and tries to put a label on him which is the last thing he wanted. He thought he may be bisexual but according to those closest to him he described himself as gay. No one knows for sure except Freddie himself but it is known he had a blatant preference for men. \nThey make Mary Austin appear to be a sweet innocent heroine (she did pay the filmmakers and had a hand in making it so I'm not surprised) when in reality she was a questionable person who did terrible things and still does them to this day. \nThe casting was meh, Brian may was spot on and John deacon looked passible, but I felt roger Taylor and of course Freddie were grossly miscast. Rogers actor looked nothing like him whatsoever. Rami Malek did nail Freddie's mannerisms and speaking voice however his appearance threw it off. His strangely shaped jaw and bug eyes did not capture the look whatsoever, coupled with his small stature and comically overexagerrated teeth. It felt like watching a caricature of Mercury. \nOverall disappointment but of course the music was the best part. Disappointed they left out some of their smaller, amazing songs and chose only to focus on the ones we've all heard a billion times over. \n\nIf you're a fan you'll walk away feeling disappointed and if you're a new fan from the movie, you'll have this twisted vision of what Queen was and who Freddie Mercury really was.",

The movie felt like it wanted to cash in on the music and a couple of historical moment, than it did on the the deeper subject matter.  If you want to see a concert inside a movie then you'll enjoy this. But if you want a deep dive into the band Queen, then you will be disappointed. Which is kind of sad because I didn't learn a single new thing about Freddie Mercury after watching the movie. The movie isn't bad in any way, but it feels like a cash grab. Because half of the stuff in the movie is a fabrication to create controversy that never happened to Queen. All the real controversial things that actually happened to the band weren't included. Its meant to be a crowd pleasing movie. For the real Queen fans your gonna leave mad cause half of the movie is a bunch of lies. R.I.P. Freddy Mercury - one of the greatest performers ever.",

When I saw I was mistaken and I still hadn't even seen half of it, I thought I should do my best to power through as it may get better. \n\nAfter another hour (in my mind) only 15 minutes had passed. I had to X out of it, I just couldn't take it. For one thing, none of the characters were likable. Rami Malek as the lead gave me nothing to care for. While he was somewhat interesting at first, as it dragged on, nothing changed. There was not much depth and I had no empathy or understanding of Mercury's difficulties or his genius. So much seemed just like cliche guess work of behavior with little insight into the human being he was. Same for all of the other characters though they had far less screen time. For these reasons I could not be pulled in or interested. A lot of the problem was the script. It just didn't provide scenes that developed character or story. The direction was also at fault for that. \n\nIn any case, after an hour that felt like four, I simply couldn't take it any longer. I refuse to waste my time on movies that can't pull me in after that much time. A movie should have a plot twist at 45 minutes into it. One that's pivotal and draws the viewer in even more.

Sasha Baron Cohen was the original choice for this movie, but the remaining members of Queen were not on board with having this comedic giant (think Bruno or Borat) representing Freddie Mercury. Rami Malek was and is definitely the better choice. Definitely deserving of its good reviews, Bohemian Rhapsody paints a portrait of Freddie Mercury's life and does a decent job of also capturing the essence of the band Queen. My only gripe with this film is that it deliberately avoids the downfall of Freddie Mercury, and thus leaves an air of incompleteness. I do understand the band's decision to end the movie on a positive note, probably one of the highest points of his/Queen's career: the Live Aid performance.",

It showed clips that lead the audience to assume what would occur( most likely because it was PG-13). In the movie, it reveals Freddie and the bands earliest encounter and how the band came about. It shows the disputes the band had that wasn't seen out in public. The movie included the original members of queen Freddie Mercury (lead vocals and piano)(flamboyant member), Brian May (lead guitar and vocals)(reasonable/unproblamatic), Roger Taylor (drums and vocals)(masculine and \"player\" of the group) and John Deacon (bass guitar)(quiet one yet the glue of the group).",

One of the best parts of the movie is the soundtrack, the Queen song are incorporated in a very good way. The highlight of the movie is the main actor Rami Malek who plays Freddie who is more than up to the task. The cast is well assembled and the passing is really smooth, in my opinion one of the best biopics/musical of the decade.

One however can't ignore Gwilym Lee's portrayal of Brian May, which was pitch perfect, and for a few brief moments I forgot I was watching a movie depiction of the band, that's how good Lee's portrayal and likeness was. Other than the performances of the primary cast, the movie in and of itself just left me wanting a little bit; visually and in terms of music and sound mixing it was fabulous, however the plot for me was a little unevenly balanced, and certain elements were changed in order to enhance the dramatic tension (though that often happens in biopics). It is a wonderful tribute to Queen at their peak, but if you're expecting a cinematic masterpiece you will end up being disappointed, as the overall narrative is at times wonky and unengaging, though if you're a die hard Queen fan you will likely love it.",

Movies like A Star is Born is rated a lot more higher than this, yet this film did come out after that film. All of these musician films have been popping up, so you know what I'm gonna do. Watch them all! So first things first, not the one that started it all. I love Queen's songs with Bohemian Rhapsody being my favourite. This film is a good origin film for the band. I'm just going to say that Rami Malek portraying Freddie in this film, is outstanding, same as the other actors against the band members. Like, they look the same. Sure you can tell I don't really have a lot to say about this film. It does seem rewatchable, and I do feel like that will be needed. But I enjoyed my time with this film.",

I thought maybe we'd be watching the life and death of Mercury in a matter of 20 minutes. \n\nI resent how insincere the film felt. There were endearing moments with some real human connection but Rami Malek failed so hard to bring any amount of depth to Mercury. I loved Malek in Mr. Robot. His disconnected scattered demeanor fit that character so perfectly. Unfortunately Malek wasn't able to leave Elliot Anderson behind while portraying a pop rock superstar. He kept taking me out of the story by reminding I was just watching a movie. That is always a bad sign and mark of a not so great film. If you can't draw and keep someone engaged, it's a matter of a lackluster performance. \n\nI thought the other actors showed decent and sometimes strong  talent. I believed what they were selling me though the pace and feeling of \"we need to hit all the bullet points in 2 hours\" didn't allow for enough emotional realness to actually feel connected to any of the characters. \n\nThe movie was entertaining and I truly felt for Mercury in his illness and dying. I'll give it that. \n\nSigh. I'm disappointed. I don't think I'd feel so strongly if the movie hadn't won best actor and best picture. I really don't get it. True Queen and Mercury fans deserved better. I can only hope that someone will retell his story beautifully and honor the memory of Freddie Mercury properly. Fingers crossed. ",
