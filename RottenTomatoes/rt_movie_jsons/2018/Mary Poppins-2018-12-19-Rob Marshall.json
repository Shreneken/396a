    "summary": "Now an adult with three children, bank teller Michael Banks learns that his house will be repossessed in five days unless he can pay back a loan. His only hope is to find a missing certificate that shows proof of valuable shares that his father left him years earlier. Just as all seems lost, Michael and his sister receive the surprise of a lifetime when Mary Poppins -- the beloved nanny from their childhood -- arrives to save the day and take the Banks family on a magical, fun-filled adventure.",

It features (like the original film) a mix of animation and live action scenes and various irritatingly catchy tunes (you've been warned, parents). Its certainly an entertaining watch...not by any means a particularly stand-out, amazingly memorable film, this is a solid piece of good family entertainment, which I imagine pretty much all fans of the original film will enjoy, certainly in parts, if not in full. Of course its also very much sentimental and unsurprisingly cheesy (but of course!), with some pretty predictable plot aspects but I suppose that's pretty much to be expected. As Disney films like this go, its well worth a watch if your interested I reckon, so yes, I'd recommend it, although I wouldn't necessarily say its the best of recent Disney films, its by no means bad either.

            "content": "Spit spot!  Mary Poppins is back, and she has just as much to impart on us this time as she did her previous visit.  Yes, times have changed since we saw her last, but life's quandaries are still solved the same way.  Mary makes sure we know that being positive will always give us the best outcome, that every task can have an element of fun if we choose to find/see it, and that one need never apologize for who they are.\n\nSequels of classic films rarely live up to anyone's expectations.  For this reason, I thought it best to avoid seeing Mary Poppins Returns when it debuted in 2018, lest it sully my appreciation for the original flick (Mary Poppins).  However, since I made it my 2022 goal to view every motion picture featuring Meryl Streep, I was forced to take this sequel in.  And now that I have\u2026 I'm very appreciative of the experience.  It was an enchanting escape.\n\nEmily Blunt took on the unenviable task of stepping into an iconic role established in 1964 by the legendary Julie Andrews.  Blunt wisely chose to make the character her own, rather than attempting to act like Julie Andrews.  Her Poppins is a bit sterner but still imbued with a sense of whimsy and humor.  Lin-Manuel Miranda plays new character, Jack, who is a former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to chimneysweep, Bert, from the original film.  Jack is a lamplighter who is aware of who Mary Poppins is before she arrives.   \n\nMary Poppins returns to 1930's London to help Michael and Jane Banks.  Michael and Jane were the children she nannied in the original film.  Now they are grown and in peril of losing their family home in a foreclosure to the bank.  Michael is a widower with three precocious children of his own.   Actors Pixie Davies, Nathanael Saleh, and Joel Dawson play Annabel, John, and Georgie Banks, and all three are delightful from the get-go.  Pish posh!  Mary takes the new children on grand adventures, just as she did in the original film.  While the movie is just as clever as the original, it isn't quite as sharp.  There are no Super-cali-fragil-istik-expi-ali-docious or Spoon Full of Sugar ditties that you will be humming or whistling for days after.  One of the more memorable songs is when Mary's cousin Topsy (Meryl Streep) sings \"Turning Turtle\".  Streep, in usual form, makes the absolute most of her outrageous character and her eight minutes of screen time\u2026 in the most delightful way.  \n\nIf you are a fan of the original Mary Poppins and you have not seen this sequel, do yourself a favor and take some time to do so!  Sometimes some saccharine is simply grand for the soul.",

A kinda sequel many years later, with a generation skipped, little to no exposition needed, just enough difference to the original that you don't directly compare and Disney resist the urge to go modern on 3D animation, opting instead for a retro feel of the original. That's about as well as you can do to be honest, from there you have to like Poppins and buy into the conceit, similarly explored in Paddington, that the travails of a lovely middle class West London family is the most important thing in the world. In Poppins, cue forlock tugging, leaping cocked-ees risking life and limb to scale Big Ben Tower when Poppins just floats up on a brolly.

The kids were good. The maid was good as was the captain. But, Emily Blunt as Mary?  Trying too hard. Far too posh and stuffy.

Michael Banks is going to loose his house and Mary Poppins comes back and teaches his kids to change their dad around with reverse psychology.  Adding to it a boring villain, Computer Generated Animation trying to pass its self off for hand drawn animation and Disney once again making A wolf a horrible character.(another way of pushing the wolf to extinction)  Mary Poppins Returns is a recycled and hastily done sequel that is that makes you appreciate the original one more and is yet again another reason why Disney has no respect for the original film and tarnishs the characters that where created.

That line in the movie immediately told me that the writers of this film had no idea what the first movie was about. Since this film is written as a sequel, but is essentially a remake of the original it doesn't have the spirit it needed to call it a true Mary Poppins movie. Emily Blunt was enjoyable in the lead role, though she can't seem to keep her feet in the right formation, and I felt she smiled too much. Lin-Manuel Miranda was miscast in this film. His acting chops didn't seem to match what was expected of a film actor. The sets in this film didn't have the same London feel from the original, instead they looked like set pieces in a sound stage built for a small musical. The music in this movie is mostly forgettable with the exception of \"A Cover is Not a Book\" and \"The Place Where Lost Things Go\". The climax of this movie felt pointless after everything was done. The best thing in this film is the cameo from Dick Van Dyke, I was smiling every moment he was on screen.

Our anticipation for this night was more than just rewarded, we received a very pleasant reminder that although we are more than half a century old we are all still children at heart if we just allow our imaginations to wander as when we were children.\n\nEmily Blunt was perfectly cast as Mary Poppins as was Lin-Manuel Miranda as Jack the Lantern lighter. The story line surrounds the now adult Michael Banks (Ben Whishaw) who lost his wife just a few years ago and is trying to raise his three (3) young children in the original Banks family home at 17 Cherry Tree Lane. Michael's sister Jane (Emily Mortimer) is single, never married, and has her own apartment while she fights for the rights of the low income workers.\n\nMichael Banks three children are Anabel,John and the youngest Georgie. The three Banks children love their father and sooner than they should have to worry about losing their home through a bank foreclosure , Mary Poppins magically appears. Mrs. Shullivan and I, as well as the rest of the theaters audience let out a noticeable sigh of relief because we realized that the magic of a Walt Disney movie is now upon us, and we were not disappointed in our faith in Mary Poppins. Quite the contrary, the evening was perfect as the films songs were beautiful, the dance numbers choreographed and animated to as many animals as were on Noah's Ark, the cinematography magical and the story of Michael and Jane Banks and the children that warms one's heart.\n\nWe especially loved the Banks childrens first afternoon bath with Mary Poppins and their most colorful and animated underworld adventure with song and dreams of a magical world. Just believe and anything is possible!",

Unless of course the casting, the performances, the songs and the story are all confident and on point. Which, to my immense relief, they mostly are.\n\nThe songs mostly work - the only musical sequence that felt like a false-step to me was the one involving Meryl Streep's character, a side-line of the plot which felt unnecessary and a little indulgent. Otherwise, the performances are confident and pitch-perfect. Ben Wishaw, also given his excellent work in the Paddington films, is beginning to carve a niche for himself in these family films; there's something in his careful blend of fragility and hidden strength  - as well as exceptional comic timing - that is ideal for these films. Lin-Manuel Miranda burns up the screen every time he's on it with an effervescence that confirms him as a performer born for musicals. \n\nBut it all hinges, naturally, on the title character. Given an almost impossible task, Emily Blunt is pretty much perfect, the right mix of continuity with the original performance and making the character uniquely her own. At no point did I find myself thinking that this isn't the Mary Poppins who was so ever-present in my childhood. \n\nThe plot is also surprisingly clever, dealing with some important themes of adults repressing the magical innocence of child-like fun under the weight of life's responsibilities and losses. Like all the best family entertainment, this film isn't afraid to look pain and grief in the face. \n\nThe measure of how successful this film is comes with the ending. I had thought the rush to the bank against the clock (neatly nodding at Hitchcock in part of the action) was the film's ending, but there were still a good number of minutes to go and I feared an over-extended goodbye that would leave me frustrated and bored. But what resulted was an honest, joyful sequence that stays the right side of over-sentimentality and allows an ending fitting to the film's bigger themes; it's moving and uplifting without being naive or saccharine, in such a way as to suggest that this Mary Poppins - as she always does - has arrived at just the right time. This film may actually be one we all need more than we realise.",

This is the sort of difference that happens in sequels when the writers are trying to force a recreation rather than naturally extending a story.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the premise, if a bit forced, is lovely and the story is decent enough, but it is the embodiment of Disney's Mary Poppins that Emily Blunt portrays that carries the movie.  I like all the cast in this, some more than others, but everyone did a great job on their deliveries, but the only roles that would have made a real difference would have been Mary Poppins, and possibly Jack, but maybe not.\n\nI would like to see more Mary Poppins, but I'm not sure if one can keep the momentum for this sort of thing, what would a story (or two) look like from her perspective?",

There were some choices that I thought 'why did they even do this if it didn't lead up to something big?' I'm sure people liked seeing similar stuff for the nostalgia, but I was kind of hoping for something fresh and new. No such luck.

The only two new things this one did are tackling the theme of overcoming grief and giving us an actual villain. While I found the former addition to be absolutely brilliant and it even added a dramatic touch that could be felt from the very first minutes of the movie and the message behind it could be summed up in the lovely, touching song, The Place Where Lost Things Go, I do not think the inclusion of an actual, real villain to be a good decision at all. I believe it somehow took away from the moral value of the movie a little bit, and made it more \"childish\", so to speak. That said, Mary Poppins Returns is almost supercalifragilisticexpialidocious as the 1964's classic.\n\n(8/10)",

            "content": "\"Mary Poppins Returns\" actually does alright on its own. Independent of the 1964 masterpiece \"Mary Poppins\", this is a perfectly passable and somewhat enjoyable film. However, the main and glaring flaw of this production is that it simply does the same things that the 1964 original did, except not nearly as well. But it isn't entirely this film's fault \u2013 after all, it is impossible to live up to the masterpiece that is the 1964 original. Emily Blunt is no Julie Andrews, but she performs well as Mary Poppins. Lin-Manuel Miranda doesn't do quite as well as Blunt, and not nearly as well as Dick Van Dyke in the 1964 original, but he does okay. All the other performances are passable, but not nearly as memorable as those in the 1964 original. In my opinion, the songs in this film are actually pretty good, even though they're blatant imitations of the far-better, catchy, memorable, and brilliantly-written songs of the 1964 original. The script and the story are easily this film's weak points \u2013 they're either bad because they make no sense or bad because they're far too similar to the 1964 original. Most of all, it lacks most of the heart and soul that made the 1964 original the masterpiece it is. Yet it's still an okay film. All in all, while \"Mary Poppins Returns\" isn't practically perfect in every way, it is a passable film which has its moments. Not a must-see, but if you think you'd be interested, take a look at it.",

I definitively have decided now that for reasons I can't explain but feel in every one of his films, I hate Rob Marshall's directing in every way; the way he makes the amazing feel flat and mundane like you're watching it from the cheap seats. He's got no actual style and some retro Disney stylings would have been nice instead of just the (pleasant) references. The effects are tremendous and the child actors perfect for this kind of film. And about halfway through the film blossoms. But the plot is just not new or old enough to be interesting at all. It's unclear what it's trying to say.

But viewed on its own, Mary Poppins Returns is well worth the watch. The film is respectful of its forbear, with snatches of melodic lines from the original film embedded in its score, and many of the scenes loosely built around the original. I loved that the animation is in the old Disney style, rather than Pixar-ized (not that there's anything wrong with Pixar). At the same time, there are contemporary elements: Miranda's rap turn, and the decidedly funky dance moves in the leerie production number. All the performances were solid, with Whishaw, Miranda, Holdbrook-Smith and newcomer Joel Dawson as standouts. Blunt made Mary her own, bringing a hint of world-weary melancholy to the role. The well-realized characters, storytelling and obvious love of the material more than balanced the beautifully designed settings and CGI. My only caveat is with a plot point: why would Mary Poppins let the lamplighters make such a risky manoeuvre at the end when she has the magic to fix the problem right from the start? Other than that, a worthy and heart-warming effort all round.",

Emily Blunt takes on the iconic role of Mary Poppins, but as good as she is she's no Julie Andrews and comes off as a little more stern and less kind.  And the musical numbers aren't nearly as catchy and fun as those from the original film.  A couple are alright, but most of them go on too long, are over produced, and try too hard to be charming and lighthearted.

The music was sufficiently fun and playful (though a bit saucier than I expected in one clip when Mary and Jack are singing on stage), with a surprisingly collection of darker and serious themes than I believe the older film would have ever approached.  Emily Blunt steps in well for the incomparable Julie Andrews, and Lin-Manuel Miranda shines with his own impish warm heartedness.\n\nI was so enamored with this film, I even confessed my trepidation for watching it after we finished simply so I could apologize to my girlfriend.

Sadly those expectations fell short with complicated songs and dance routines that in my personal opinion did not do justice to the original's legacy.  I also was not a fan of the demeanor of this new Mary Poppins, Julie Andrews while being an amazing singer and wonderful actress brought a sense of light and hope to the original role this new character seemed rather demanding and almost mean at times.  Without the calm charismatic character of the original Mary poppins I found that the new role did not in any way do justice to the original and the role played originally by Julie Andrews could not hope to be replaced by this. That is whatever this role was supposed to be as the character seemed not only harsh and demanding but also lacked the fun, happy, and humorous part that Julie Andrews had provided.  Then throw in a couple lack luster non-catchy music numbers like \"Turning Turtle\" and \"Trip A Little Light Fantastic\" which seemed to really dumb down quite a bit from the original music numbers and could never hope to stack up with \"supercalifragalisticexpialadocious\" or \"Chim-chimney\" and you'll have the gist of this movie.  Don't get me wrong the actors did a great job with their roles and I personally love Collin Firth but this movie just didn't do justice to the legacy it was set to represent and frankly Mary Poppins flying in on a kite isn't quite the same for me as the traditional umbrella.  Not to mention that it cannot he escaped that the new Mary Poppins looks nothing like Julie Andrews.  The cameos from Angela Lansbury and Van Dyke were a nice addition to the film as well but A few nice moments cannot make up for all the other parts in which this film was severely lacking.  I could go on but I think my point is made.",

Poppins takes a backseat to Jim & every other obnoxious character that pops in at each stage of the film, and the film does feel like just going thru the motions of each stage, until Poppins just up and leaves, forgotten, then we get slapped with the credits. Instead of calling this film \u201cPoppins\u201d they should have called it \u201cJim\u201d, because that terrible character was pretty much thru out the entire movie that we were subjected to follow his stupid story & stuck with his awful singing, it was pure cringe. Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s acting & attempt of being British was an epic failure. Just because he got notoriety for one play on broadway, doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s talented in other genres. Miranda was overplayed & way out of his dept. He single handedly destroyed this film. Why was this film focused on JIM over everybody else?? This film was more of a fan made film tribute involving the location where Mary Poppins took place and an egotistical love letter by Miranda to himself. To top it off, The lyrical tunes were incredibly poorly written, the music was out of place, forgettable, forced, & just awful. Nobody is singing this garbage. This movie sucked. The characters sucked, the casting sucked, UGH, I\u2019m annoyed I was duped into having been subjected to this garbage. Such a waste. ",

I must point out, this is not a retread, but a continuation of the Mary Poppins (1965) film starring Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke, both of whom are still living.  It's hard to watch this film and not draw comparisons, but Emily Blunt made a very convincing Mary, both in singing ability and characterization.  Lin-Manuel's lamplighter is clearly a step up compared to Van Dyke's chimney-sweep. He has a much better British accent.  Meryl Streep has a completely silly musical scene with a Russian accent, with an apparent homage to the late Ed Wynn's \"I Love To Laugh\" Scene.  The lamplighters, on bicycle's do a musical dance number in homage to Van Dyke's \"Step In Time\" number.  There is a lot of \"homage\" going on here; it's as if the film is self aware of it's own history.  There is a song-and-dance number with Poppins and penguins (animated), to compare with the dance number Van Dyke did in 1965.  Finally, Van Dyke himself makes a cameo appearance, reprising the same bank elder from 54 years earlier.  Angela Lansbury has a cameo as a balloon lady in the park, which sets up the finale piece \"Nowhere To Go But Up\", which is basically a homage to \"Let's Go Fly A Kite\". On the whole, its a lot of fun, but there's a little bit too much \"seriousness\" with the plotline about the Bank's children losing the house to the very bank George Banks was an employee of, with Colin Firth as the \"bad guy'.",

Especially one with an agenda.\n\nLuckily this was not the case and I have to say that I quite liked this movie. Disney actually managed to keep the ambiance of the original movie and it actually felt like a Disney movie from the good old days. The days before every easily offended (censored by RT) tried to make every movie into a preaching mouth piece for their personal crusade.\n\nI think I liked the first half of the movie best. It was an explosion of song, magic and, for me, nostalgia. Apart from the hugely improved technology this movie had available to make the magic bits it actually felt like it could have been made back to back with the original. They really managed to capture the atmosphere from back then.\n\nIf I had to compare the two directly I would still go with the original as the best one. It was more imaginative and it just felt a bit better two me.\n\nThe story is a bit of a rehash of the original. They could have come up with something more original. Also, the second movie seemed to fizzle out a bit compared to the first half. I would have liked to see some more Mary Poppins coolness and magic, like we saw in the first half of the movie, instead of, mostly, conventional stuff.

Emily Blunt somehow managed to perfectly capture the mystique of the enigmatic Mrs Mary Poppins, she ain't no Julie Andrews, but she came damn close and did Julie justice. Her singing voice is pretty good, though I'd be lying if I said I wasn't missing Julie Andrews' higher octaves. Mary Poppins knows how to make an entrance, and Emily's version made quite a spectacular one. Keeping in tradition with the original film, this film wonderfully blends CGI, live-action and 2D animation in one seamless go, proving that Disney's still got the chops to do a proper 2D animation, it was their bread and butter after all. The story is refreshing yet familiar enough for fans of the original to spot the similarities, though it's more of a nostalgia trip. The music was wonderful, though it doesn't come close the original songs, some of which were name-dropped in the movie, but that doesn't detract from the entertainment value of the film. Dick Van Dyke's cameo was hilarious and Angela Lansbury (Mrs Potts from Beauty and the Beast) was a wonderful sight to see at 93. Not that the film really needed  a cameo by Julie Andrews herself, but that was the one thing the movie was sorely missing. It's difficult to sum up the movie in just one word, but there is one particular word that sums it up practically perfect in every way. As Mary Poppins said herself, it's a word you say when you don't know what to say: It's Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.",

            "content": "Mary Poppins Returns film seems to be a kind of a musical film. So, it's a little difficult for me to review because I'm not that much fan of those kinds of films.\n\nFirst of all, Emily Blunt as Mary Poppins surprised me. Although I've saw just on film which she was in (film name is The Girl On the Train), I didn't think that she could fit the role. But amazingly, she could. She did a great job, especially the dancing scenes which I don't like that much but those scenes are amazing.\n\nThe makeup is so good. Emily Blunt is so beautiful, like I could fall in love with her. (Just kidding. I was just saying how beautiful she was in the movie.)\n\nThe costume is also cool too. I bet the costume designer put a lot of effort to it. I love that they chose the old times rather than the current era. (You know what I mean. I love the English's old times because the costumes are so cool.) I totally love their outfits.\n\nThe acting is also good, especially, Ben Whishaw. I couldn't even recognise him because of his moustache. When he started to talk, I could recognise him. At that time, I was like oh, it's Ben Whishaw. LOL.\n\nEverything is perfect in the film. The location, the settings and all, but there are two things I don't like. One is maybe because I'm not that much into original score, I don't like the songs. Those songs they sang made me annoyed. Every time they started to sing, I wished those scenes needed to over soon, so that I could continue to watch.\n\nThe other thing I don't like is the film is full of dancing scenes. It's like an Indian film where a lot of people are coming out of where the audiences don't know where they are coming out, out of the blue. I kind of don't like those kinds of films.\n\nTo summarise, the story is so simple but maybe the director is good, it didn't make me bored. I watched this last night before going to bed. At that time, I had semi-heavy eyes, but I didn't feel sleepy or fall asleep. I could watch it from beginning to end. Some scenes are funny and some scenes are sad, plus some songs made sad more and more. You will feel some emotions and at the same time, it will make you feel warm to see how Mary Poppins take care of children. So, it's a film that is good to enjoy with family. It's totally worth spending time with.",

And of course this is coupled by amazingly catchy songs from Marc Shaiman and Scott Whitman (I mean how could people be saying the songs are not memorable when there's \"Can You Imagine That?\" For crying out loud people you've forgotten your inner child!) and a stunning Emily Blunt (who I personally preferred over Julie Andrews) with a joyful Lin-Manuel Miranda, being, well himself (I'm not complaining). Even the kids are great too, leaving a movie that is in fact comparable to the original's magical spell. I cried during the \"Place Where The Lost Things Go\" and \"Nowhere To Go But Up\" scenes, and finding that kind of emotional connection is exactly why we watch films like this in the first place. ",

She's become much more strict, and although that is what she was always intended to be, the jump between personalities doesn't  fit very well. But it is the first film I have seen in a while that has hand drawn animation, and Rob Marshall's way of taking a beloved film and using the same formula that people loved is rather clever.",

There were several subplots which not only had no point, they had no conclusion.  One such subplot involved a bowl which had belonged to the deceased mother, which seemed to exist for the sole purpose of introducing a role for Meryl Streep to play (who was brilliant, as usual) and disappeared completely once she did her bit without conclusion.  The children from the original were now grown up with kids, yet the chimney sweep, who now lights and extinguishes street lamps, is the same age.  It must be 20 years later at least, but he hasn't aged a day.  The original was about teaching the parents a lesson about valuing time with their kids and all the sub plots were ancillary, but to that point.  In this one the overall plot seemed to be about not losing the house.  It was painfully obvious when the boy found the paper they needed and stuck it in his pocket and there was literally no connection whatsoever to any of the subplots.  This movie was very typical of the current Hollywood trend to rehash old ideas and try to make them new, but without actually adding anything.  The writing was lazy, nothing more than taking anything and everything from the original that people loved and sticking it together.  The entire purpose of the plot seemed to be nothing more than to glue together all the things people loved about the original without actually adding anything.",

            "content": "I am a fan of the original PL Travers books, and also a fan of the original Disney movie (not the same character really)  In the books, Mary Poppins is a rather plain, strict, rather cruel nanny, who introduces the children to all kinds of strange people and events, then refuses to acknowledge they happened at all or that the people were in the least strange.  I have always suspected Travers was trying to warn kids that hella things are going to happen to them in life, things for which there are no good explanations or reasons, and that they better learn how to deal with that now.  (As her life was filled with such events as distant and suicidal mothers, alcoholic and tubercular fathers and early parent death)  The Disney movie softened Mary Poppins and prettied her up, while still giving her the magical abilities and a sort of loving but totally English and no nonsense nanny.\n\nSo my idea of Mary Poppins has always been somewhere between these two idealizations of her.  When she returns in this new Disney movie, I almost started crying.  I was surprised at how much I guess I had needed her to return.  So I was ready to love this movie.\n\n\nOnly, I didn't.  The original Disney version had real in depth characters, whose actions were motivated by the needs and desires OF those characters.  The father, Mr Banks, wants to provide a stable and disciplined household to his family, full of British patriarchy of the era.  His idea of a what a proper British home should be informs his actions AND his songs.  The rest of the characters are the same, from Bert to the children, all only sing or say what you can actually see their characters singing or saying,  There are no superfluous songs or dialogue in the original, and the story line is one flowing arc from beginning to end.\n\nIn this new version, however, characters are just thrown in for good measure.  They are not necessary for the plot, and are pale imitation copies of the original.  Jack the lamplighter is just a pale imitation of Bert the chimney sweep, Ellen the maid has no backstory or real need to be in the story, etc. etc. And the adventures Poppins takes the new children on (they are the children of the original Michael Banks) have no real fit into the story line.  It is a disjointed mess.\n\nIn the original books, the places Poppins takes the kids, always have some fit into what is going on in their lives and they play out fully in the stories.  Same with the original movie.  But in this new telling, Poppins takes the children on several adventures that just seem to be a chance for a bit of song and dance.  The \"let's take a bath\" scene is like this.  I think about 3 of these scenes could have been cut from the movie without loss of story at all.\n\nThe movie is lovely to look at, but most of the songs are truly forgettable.  The one exception I think will be \"The place where the lost things go\".  This is a lovely, grief filled lullaby, and those with a bit of age on them will certainly be moved to tears with the thoughts of those lost to them over the years, and the idea of seeing them in dreams and memory.\n\nThe movie is chock full of talent, and everyone does their best here.  Meryl Streep is truly delightful as Poppins cousin, and it is great to see Dick Van Dyke dance again.  \n\nHowever, the movie just rehashes basically the same story line from the first movie (father is too preoccupied and doesn't pay enough attention to his own children, Poppins comes to help set things right by turning everything upside down, the kids get lost, Bert, er, Jack helps them find their way home, evil bankers want to take things from this family and the father finally sees the light and everybody goes to fly a kite, er balloons.\n\nC'mon Disney.  You have lost what Walt knew.  The source material is better than this, you don't need to remake the first one to have a good movie or a hit, and characters still matter in good storytelling.  You can't just wow us with a bunch of disjointed songs and expect us to be sold or pleased.\n\nSo I merely just \"liked\" this movie okay or so-so.  And I feel that next time I see Poppins fly back into my life, I probably won't cry ...I will be bracing myself that the movie is any good.  Shame on you Disney for doing that.",

            "content": "Talk about a bad return. Not sure where to start. First I just felt like it was a pale imitation of the original. Taking each scene and finding a different way of doing the same thing so no originality. Then the music. It was much more present in this version with nearly all characters singing a lot but ok that could have been fine but it wasn't. It became cheesy very fast. Plus the songs were mostly boring, hardly understandable or were there because in the original there was a song there so they had to have a song there but none of the songs felt right or had the impact. It all felt overworked. Plus that awful scene where Blunt/MP changes hair style and sings with a cockney accent, that was just horrific and so out of character. \nTalking about the actors. The kids were really good. The actress who played Jane I liked as well I could see traits of child Jane in her at times but Michael was ridiculous. They kept nothing from the child he was and the way they just made him look (visually and in character) like an updated version of his father was just a shame. Now to the two mains. First Jack. Again can't remember the name of the actor. Way too posh and smart for the role he was playing. As a lamplighter he would have been poor. We know he's been working since he's a kid so probably hardly went to school at all so the way he spoke was totally out of character. Plus he was clean all the time. That just wasn't realistic. What made Bert so fantastic was that he was so \"one of the lads\" he fit in to his environment. This guy sticks out. As for MP/Blunt she has some good moments but most, specially when she is talking are just overplayed. Julie Andrews was naturally poised and somewhat well spoken and sophisticated. Her MP was natural, easy. It was just her with a bit of acting. With blunt you could feel that this was not natural for her. I did watch until the end but I found it quite hard. If you want to watch Marry Poppins then watch the original. There  nothing in the new one that is worth seeing.",

Trying to make the audience go on a journey of what it feels like to be young again. Emily Blunt was brilliant as Mary Poppins and was the perfect choice for the character. The plot follows Michael Banks (Ben Whishaw) who is a struggling widowed father of three kids. He is about to lose his childhood home to the bank. And when he is struggling to find the share certificate for the house. And afraid he cannot handle every responsibility. Mary Poppins (Emily Blunt) shows up to help and take care of his kids. With Jack (Lin-Manuel Miranda) a lamplighter who accompanies Mary Poppins. They will take the kids into a magical journey to help find the share certificate and to help their father Michael save their home. The film does have several fun magical musical sequences with the original music making an appearance. Although, I did feel like a few of the musical sequences were quite forgettable. With the musical songs being similar to the other. There was nothing new or a fresh energy but being repetitive. There are some musical scenes that travel into an animated world which is fun and interesting to see. But the film does struggle in bringing something fresh throughout. Lin-Manuel Miranda was good. Ben Whishaw was good as well but spent most of his on screen performance worried and in a hurry. Emily Mortimer was okay but underused. Julie Walters makes a fun appearance. Dick Van Dyke returns as well and was good. Colin Firth playing the villain role of a banker who wants Mr. Banks house desperately. And does not care that he is a struggling father. Meryl Streep was good too but her role was brief for only one musical sequence. Overall, Mary Poppins Returns is a fair fantasy musical film. The plot is cute and charming about Mary Poppins and the kids trying to help the father save the house. But for its long running time and several repetitive musical sequences. It did not have that fresh progression with the music.",

The plot was forced on you so fast but the movie was slowed down by mediocre musical performances that tried to recreate the original magic.  The scriot was basically the original story just rewritten.  Chimney sweeps were changed to lamp lighters.  Mary's Uncle they visited changed into a cousin of Mary's. Everyone character from the original is gone but the old man with a canon.  How is he still alive? He was older than the parents.  The big dance with the lamp lighters was in no way as intense as the chimney sweeps \"steppin time\".  Manuel is very talented but in no way is he as talented as Dick Van Dyke.  The back ground dancers had a hard time keeping up with Dick but Manuel had a hard time keeping up with the background dancers.  In that little cameo at the end Van Dyke out dances Manuel at 97. I didn't feel Emily Blunt has the same love for Mary Poppins that Julie Andrews did.  I felt like Emily was just baby sitting while Julie taught the kids lessons in life. I felt we were proded by forced songs and forced pulled heart strings through out the movie.  The biggest joke was the forced ending trying to recreate the feeling of \"Let's go fly a kite\" with ballons with Angela Lansbury as the singing magical balloon lady in the \npark.  That was the worse. I guess she was suppose to be the old pigeon lady and now she gives out balloons.  \nI remember as a kid after seeing Mary Poppins for the first time coming out singing the songs.

This incredibly boring movie comes off like a vegas tribute to mary poppins, but without the rights to to the original music. i was excited to see emily blunt in this, but her take on mary was completely wrong. i haven't read the books, and i don't care how accurate it might be. julie andrews worked because of her hilarious, wonderful characterization of a stern but deeply loving nanny. blunt has no humor; in fact, she acts vain, haughty, pissy, and a bit too much above the other characters and situations. the one tender song about love and loss is thrown away with no set up whatsoever; no word of the children missing their mom, and therefore no payoff. the lampwick guy simply has no character at all; just a smiley dull accomplice. but hardly that, as mary poppins winds up doing everything for everyone, after she pretends she can't. the songs are an insult to the sherman brothers, shoving their melodies into a blender and spitting out soulless soundalikes we hear in every meta-musical on broadway today. no wonder julie andrews refused to take part, the script is a dog and it would have sullied her wonderful memory. a chase scene? really? with an unmotivated kidnapping? almost every scene has a direct analog to the original, yet reworked with so little imagination as to make you certain it was done by committee. so much talent, so much effort, so much money involved in this load of tripe, it's a shame. but hey, that's hollywood.",

Her mannerisms, her impersonation of Julie Andrews' Poppins... Down to the blinks and head posture... Was perfect.\n\nLin was lovable. The major dance performance by Lin and the lamp lighters was a perfect tribute to the chimney sweep performed in the original film. \n\nThey incorporated new graphic technology as well as an old style animation as shown in the original.

The sequel, produced 54 years later, does so little to distinguish itself from the original that I don't know why they didn't just set out to do a straight-up remake. Emily Blunt is as great as ever, but the acting by the children is poor, and Lin-Manuel Miranda, an actor I haven't seen a lot of, seems to be saddled with the role of 'Character who pops up now and then solely to extend the runtime.' I really wanted to enjoy the songs and the dance numbers, but they always felt like they were going on forever. The scene with the street light dancing in the park feels especially pointless. Also, I found the logic of the movie to be fatally flawed and inconsistent. Mary Poppins can turn a bathtub into an elaborate underwater world and fly down from the sky but not fix a cracked bowl. Also, in the first movie Poppins came to help the children because they were somewhat mischevious, but here she appears to take care of kids who are reasonably well behaved, and the issue here is that their house is going to be repossessed. The film then proceeds to gloss over this issue rather than addressing it, and takes every chance to demonise the father for being stressed about their impending homelessness. I got annoyed at how the film constantly treated the Dad like the bad guy, and how Mary Poppins never seemed to use her powers to truly help him. I'm not even sure if her inclusion in the film affected the final outcome. I don't know if I just misread the message, but I had a hard time properly getting into the story. To me it was certainly bright and glossy, but there seemed to be a striking lack of heart lurking beneath the surface.",

Well, maybe not right now.I didn't expect to be charmed, intrigued, and awestruck by various elements of this newest incarnation.  \n\nFor one thing, who can take the place of Julie Andrews? No one, but Emily Blunt occupied her own space with dignity, whimsy, and a magical capacity to befriend fantasy.   A different Mary, but one Ms.Travers could probably relate to.  \n\nHow is it I didn't know Lin Manuel-Miranda was in the movie? Even without his beard, it took me a quarter hour to due the necessary mental surgery to separate him from Hamilton. But like Hamilton, he immersed himself in the role, thankfully with less of an American cockney brogue than Dick Van Dyke spouted back in the day. Lin's accent had a lovely softened but still Londonish lilt. \n\nSo, this new film made bows to the original, with Meryl Streep standing in hilariously for Uncle Albert. He laughed and floated while her house turned topsy turvy.  The leeries rode bikes, lit and doused lamps, and generally illuminated their environment, even as the chimney sweeps had cleaned soot so people could warm themselves in safety.  All of these were welcome, somewhat familiar encores, though with a different tune. \n\nAnd speaking of tunes, I am wondering if I've become too old to learn all the songs by heart, particularly the one about loss and the other about books. As a teacher, I may adopt that last as an anthem. \n\nLoved the movie.",

Disney classic gold!\nLoved the musical numbers, especially the song and dance performances of Trip A Little Light Fantastic and also The Cover Is Not The Book. I also enjoyed the soft echos of old Mary Poppins tunes, playing throughout the film, at just the right times. This Mary Poppins was a little different, but she actually had me laughing much more than the original nanny did.\nFrom the moment Mary Poppins scolded the kids: \"Sit up straight. You're not flour bags!\"  I knew this nanny could not be taken seriously. The twins were trying not to topple off a ladder straddled over the back of a bicycle. What made me laugh even harder was when John tried to follow her instruction; on the back of a wobbly bicycle, tries his best to sit up straight enough for her, as if there is a pole running through his back.\n\nThe bike will fall, and take John with it, but at least his posture was perfect.\n\nAnd I could swear that Michael's missing stock certificate floated right across Mary's line of sight, right before she reminded the children that \"cleaning is not a spectator sport\", and then distracted them with chores; (and not fun chores, like snapping fingers and dancing while the room cleans itself).\n\nPerhaps I'd see this all differently if I stood on my head.\nAll I need is a different perspective.\n\nBut from the upright position of my theater seat, this is what I noticed:\n1) In the first scene, grown Michael is visited by a pair of wolves who inform him that he is about to lose his house. Grown Jane helps Michael search for his stock certificate, so he can pay off the house loan.\n\n2) Michael and Jane were minutes away from finding the lost stock certificate when they were interrupted by wild tales from the children about their bath-time adventures, courtesy of Magical Mary. Somehow, the stock certificate makes it's way into a trash box.\nWho put it there?\nThe Practically Perfect Mary Poppins did.\nThen it's on it's way out the door with Georgie.\nWho told him to throw it out?\nPractically Perfect Mary Poppins.\n\nBut Georgie is sentimentally attached to the drawing from his father which includes his mother. So he keeps it, instead. However, he also chops it to bits to use the stock certificate to patch up his kite.\nWho instructs him to do this?\nThe Practically Perfect Mary Poppins.\n\n3) The kids break their mother's \"priceless\" bowl by fighting over it.\nWho was supposed to watch them?\nPractically Perfect Mary Poppins.\n\n4) Georgie gets kidnapped when the wolf swipes his stuffed toy \"Gilly\" away from him.\nWho told Georgie to even bring that toy along?\nNone other than Practically Perfect Mary Poppins. (So she IS friends with the wolf!)\n\n5) The kids then lose their mother's priceless bowl to Mary's cousin: Topsy Turvy.\nBut not to worry: Topsy has assured the children that the bowl is worthless. Mary also forewarned the children that this bowl might just wander off to meet their deceased mother, who is hidden \"Where the Lost Things Go\".\n\n6) Grown Michael comes racing down the stairs at home, late for work, his briefcase in his hands.\nWho takes the briefcase away from him?\nThe Practically Perfect Mary Poppins did.\n\nMary hands off the briefcase to the maid, and then gives Michael a hat and umbrella; 2 things he really does not need, and opens the door for him, saying; \"Out you go.\" Only after Michael is gone does the maid suddenly realize she is still holding his briefcase, to which Mary offers to stop by the bank to deliver it to Michael.\n\n7) When the kids come tearing down the stairs at the bank, later, their father, Michael, yells at them.\nHe demands that Mary \"Take them straight home at once!\"\nAnd Mary replies; \"Yes, sir. Right away.\"\nHowever, Mary does NOT do this.\n\nInstead, Mary trails along behind the wandering kids, who are worrying aloud over how much trouble they are in. When they get lost, Mary decides to brighten up the night and entertain the kids, which makes the kids forget the awful things they learned about at the bank. By the time Mary is \"speaking leery\", the kids have completely forgotten about the wolf at the bank. The kids relay all their troubles, to the leeries, except the most pressing problem.\n\nThe rhyming, singing, dancing, playing with fire, lasts a long time, into the night, and it keeps the kids up way past their bedtime. They arrive REALLY late to get home, all drunk on \"stuff and nonsense\", which only causes their father to doubt their bank observations further.\n----------\nMary does not continue this frustrating behavior throughout the whole movie, however.\nShe actually DOES pop into action, to help, at literally the 11th hour OF the 11th hour.\nNearly a split second before the big clock (Big Ben) strikes midnight, she flies on up and changes the time. However, she first had to wait and watch Jack nearly fall to his death, as that would have been entertaining for the kids. But when Jack did not fall, Mary decides to save the day, anyway.\n\nMary saves the day, but if she had never arrived at all, the Banks children, (all 5 of them), might have been just as well off without her, (only minus a few fun adventures).",

I loved the original as a kid and still do to this day.  Everything to me was like a \"one-off\" from everything in the original.  In the original they cleaned up the room with the help of toys,  in the remake they cleaned up in the tub.  In the original they jumped into a painting, in the remake they were on a ceramic bowl.  In the original they went up to the ceiling due to laughter, in the remake the room turned upside down due to the day of the week.  There are multilple more. Again, i wanted to love it but it felt more like a \"wanna be\".  It would have been great if it was it's own story and if it was based in modern times, but it wasn't.  Mary poppins was more snarky in this movie and i felt in the original she had more of a mix with sophistication.  Not that Emily Blunt wasn't great, she did a fabulous job, but it just needed more.",

Honestly, I wanted to walk out or fall asleep but since I already paid for the movie tickets, I decided to sit through it although it was awkwardly painful to watch. The \"Can You Imagine That\" scene was decent enough and felt a bit reminiscent of the original movie but the other songs throughout the film were forgettable to say the least.",

The songs were so so, none of them I remembered, as soon as they were over, they were over. \nAnd the whole plot line of a banker just being as asshole and not wanting them to find their shares in the banks in order to save their house was stupid and reaching. I feel like that doesn\u00e2(TM)t happen ? It was super jbrelatable in that sense. \nThe actress playing Mary did a good job with what she had tho.\nAnd in my opinion the movie was 20min too long. \nIt wasn\u00e2(TM)t the worst thing, but it wasn\u00e2(TM)t anything special either.",

            "content": "The cover was NOT the book folks. There is a reason I always see a movie more than once, before giving it a review. And I admit: that habit almost always raises it's final score, from me.\nMary Poppins is back! She has returned. Why?\nBecause nobody is hiring nannies anymore: she has no other place to go, and the Banks children are still sweet and trusting and naive but they are also both still just children. After all these years.\nJane is sweet but her job is that she is a volunteer labor organizer. She is not married, so no husband is picking up the pieces. No problem though: her father was a banker, so she'll be okay.\nMichael is sweet but his job is as a part-time bank teller. His youngest son thought he was \"a painter\". Hardly enough to pay the bills for his 3 children and their old, senile live-in maid and cook. The kids must grow up faster than their father, and also they must rely on responsible practices taught to them by their deceased mother, such as buying day-old bread for a discount, in order to keep food on the table. Michael must stay in the home he grew up in, just to keep a roof over his children's heads.\n\nMy one gripe originally with this movie, and I almost downgraded severely for it, was the inclusion of Meryl Streep singing that godawful \"Turtle\" song. I could tolerate all other songs EXCEPT that one, and Streep really does not deserve a spot in a Disney film, at all. Plenty of better actresses out there, who would be thrilled with Disney. However, if they are going to include her, the role of some kind of gypsie huckster could not have been more fitting: Relieving the children of their mother's prized Royal Dalton china bowl, leaving young John with a concerned look on his face when Mary observes: \"Oh good. It looks like things are starting to turn around for my cousin\" just as the kids are leaving. Things are \"turning around\" bc they left their financially attuned mother's \"priceless\" bowl in her possession.\n\nMary may have arrived with the plan to wrestle the bowl away from the kids: She already knows their live-in maid on a first-name basis, she instructs John to help their maid when the maid has broken a look-alike bowl and then the maid mentions the items IN the house as all being \"worth more\" than anything she owns. It is that comment that inspires John to sell their mother's priceless bowl, which then gets broken by his siblings, who argue to keep it in it's place in the nursery. The movie ends, and that bowl never got returned to them; the last to have it was Topsy-Turvy - Mary Poppins's (Russian? Romani?) cousin.\n\nSo Mary is back! And Mary is a swindler?\nWell, not so fast. She is still a \"good guy\". Because 1) Nobody is hiring nannies anymore, so she has nowhere else to go. 2) The Banks children are still children. If Mary had not arrived, Michael Banks would have lost his home through irresponsibility (he draws on everything, even stock certificates. Then he throws them out like scrap paper, which his youngest son swipes from the trash pile to patch up a kite. Even Jane does not see anything wrong with pulling glue-covered patches off a kite and trying to exchange it for the shares of money their father purchased for them.) Mary turns back the clock so that late-running Michael can save his house.\nMary even whispers a dishonesty into the ear of Mr. Dawes Junior: claiming not only that Michael Banks invested tuppence into his bank, as a boy, but that those tuppence have garnered enough interest to somehow be worth more today than 16 bucks. (I read another article that estimated that would be the total worth, with inflation included).\nI might be remembering the original movie incorrectly, but I thought Michael just fed the birds with his money. However, if he DID invest 2 whole tuppence, then again, it does not speak well for Michael's salary if 16 dollars is \"more than I make in a year!\" This was his claim, when confronted about his bank loan. He needs to pay back about 16 dollars, to keep the house. And that would be if 50 years had passed, which the movie cast would indicate it was more like only 30 years from the original tuppence investment. Bank villain, William Wilkins, is correct: Mr. Dawes Junior IS \"loony\". He is far too old and senile to run the bank. Dawes does not remember what Michael did with his money, OR he does not know how much or how little such a tiny amount could grow in just a few decades.\n\nHowever, Mary Poppins did as she promised: She looked after the Banks children, Jane and Michael. With Mary's help, Mary's organization, and with a little bit of Mary's dishonesty, the house was saved. The least the Banks family could do is pay her by handing over their \"priceless\" Royal Dalton china bowl, as her payment for a nanny job well-done.\nMary's self perception may be rose-colored, as she declares her reflection from her rosy balloon to be \"practically perfect\", but what she did for the Banks family, this second time, was even more perfect than the first time, despite the 1 tiny crack in the bowl. The only imperfection, from Mary, in the whole movie.",

Also consider that the last time I saw a movie twice in a theater was in 2011 with \"The Three Musketeers,\" and the time before that was in 2001 to see \"Moulin Rouge.\"  (Ok, so about once every ten years I do this.) Also consider that I watch about 5 movies a week and I rarely, rarely see on more than once.\n\nI was very motivated to see \"Mary Poppins Returns\" again and I'm glad I did, as it was just as magical and fantastic the second time around. The movie throws nod after nod at the original, but never imitates it. It follows the original nearly beat for beat, but always in a new and glorious way. This is a movie that kids, parents, and grandparents could all see together and enjoy equally. It is super clean, filled with short snippets of wisdom, and relentlessly joyful. And Emily Blunt plays the part of Mary Poppins perfectly!\n\nI went in just hoping the movie would be okay, but for it to have been this good! It just blew me away! Reviews have been mixed, which I really can't understand. I'm even putting this above \"Singin' in the Rain\" as my favorite musical of all time! It's practically perfect in every way!

The costumes are superb as are the sets plus the hand-drawn animation brought a big smile to my face. It also has a plethora of very funny one-liners and a big heart.

I know the basics of the plot and seen/heard enough clips over the years to understand most of the references in this belated sequel, but it doesn't actually matter. Filmmaker Rob Marshall has created a supercalifragilisticexpialidocious movie that stands on its own two feet. Backed by a decent budget, Marshall - a veteran of the big screen musical with Chicago, Nine and Into the Woods already on his CV - dishes up a plethora of splendid song and dance numbers that are catchy enough for kids and clever enough for adults. A deep-sea bathtub journey (\"Can You Imagine That\") and a foot-stomping side alley jaunt (\"Trip a Little Light Fantastic\") are delightful sequences, whilst the more sombre tune \"The Place Where Lost Things Go\" has unsurprisingly been nominated for an Oscar. It seems utterly redundant to even say this, but Emily Blunt is amazing as the enchantingly mischievous nanny. Her eyes twinkle as she throws out life lessons, often in the form of witty barbs, and her ability to hold a tune is impressive. Not everything is a home run: Lin-Manuel Miranda (playing the adult version of chimneysweep Jack from the original) isn't as charismatic as you would hope for the second-billed performer, a climactic cameo is admirable but strange, and the final song is a bit underwhelming. All in all though, Mary Poppins Returns is a joyous family experience that shines bright with the toe-tapping wonder of old-Hollywood musicals.",

Emily Blunt is the perfect person to revive Mary Poppins as she has the same sweet, partly authoritarian, smile of Julie Andrews. The director geniusly copied the style of the original movie of 1964 and some scenes could actually have been a part of the first flick. Once again one is taken into a child's fantasy world and even as an adult one can dip into this joy of falling into a world of carefree images. For me the part which is emerged into a cartoon world is by far the best and I wished there would have been more. Thus said one has to mention that the movie, with its 130 minutes, is way too long for children, and for adults, while enjoyable for some time to be reminded of one's own youth, becomes a bit too stretched after, in clear Disney tradition, way too many songs. 90 minutes should have been enough. 6/10 points.",

Another shout out is to whomever cast the kids. There's such a wonderful authenticity about them. These are among the film's few redeeming qualities. Disney appears to have no imagination for drama in kids movies beyond \"let's kill off the mother\". We literally just saw it in The Nutcracker. Threat of losing the house is another cliche. Both are exploited and trivialized in the worst possible way. What little there is in terms of a story could be told in 10 minutes. Or less. The rest of the film is shamelessly padded by stretched out musical numbers some with little relevance to the \"story\". Parts of the scene in the bowl offered a glimpse of the whimsical quality that could have made the film work for me - what's a dream, what's really, what's magic, what's ingenuity. But no, the movie decided, magic is real, except when they needed some suspense and all of a sudden someone had to risk his life, only to have the problem solved by magic anyway. The only musical number that worked for me was the one with Meril Strip. It was funny, smart, relevant, and original. Hopefully all those big stars at least had fun making this film. Though Dick Van Dyke scene made me cringe. And poor Colin Firth was saddled with a thankless role of a boring, barely two dimensional (forget three) villain. Really, every character is barely two dimensional. So, I guess ultra talented Lin Manuel Miranda cannot be blamed for his one note performance. I hate to say it though, but his singing also sounded kind of one note to me.",

Good characters but portrayed poorly, but there are some fun and enjoyable characters that younger kids would enjoy. I very much dislike Mary Poppins in this movie. She trys to be the original but she doesnt come across as fun and likeable as the original. Good cinematography with some cool shots. Story bland and predictable. The comedy fails even thou theres not too many jokes. Good set design and practical props. Bad CGI that looks ugly and very fake. Bad green screen that doesn)t even take you into the world there trying to show you except the 2D scene which wasnt to bad and probably the best scene in the film. A few blunders here and there. Okay songs but a lot of the time the singers will try to hit a note but fail, and some of the lyrics are out of place or just trying to make the song longer, but the film was quite enjoyable and the younger audience will probably like it a lot more.

The music: To this day I can still sing much of the catchy \"Spoonful of Sugar\" from the original, but I have already forgotten all the songs in this movie, though I have just seen it. One song in particular was rather unpleasant.  I've seen so much worse -(I'd rather eat glass than watch The Shape of Water again; eat glass then wander naked into a patch of poison ivy)- though I don't imagine I'll remember this film for long. Michael and Jane were the best characters, except for the artistry of Dick van Dyke, who popped in to show everyone else how it should be done.  I don't think it's as good or as bad as most of the reviews indicate- I give it a solid C to C+.",

The one truly enjoyable thing was the Lamplighters' dance, until they started doing sick bicycle ramp tricks, then I was done.\n\nUltimately left me with the feeling, \"Was this really the best they could do?\" This sequel will go on the shelf with Little Mermaid 2, and the 5 Land Before Time sequels.

One of the biggest problems of ultra high-resolution film is that is makes suspending disbelief 10x harder. The effects and dancing have to be better then ever. And they just were not. The choreography of dance scenes was utterly pathetic compared to the old days of 2 angles and the best dancers on earth accomplishing breathtaking feats in 1 take. Now its a massive montage of camera angles changing so fast there is literally nothing great being accomplished to astonish your senses. It's like our only hope for skilled movement portrayal is in Chinese cinema these days. That and the amount pitch correction  in certain lead roles is utterly pathetic. Some of them were clearly good singers. Clearly identifiable by detectable pitch correction or lack thereof. That's my 2 cents. See it at home when its on Amazon.

Disney doesn't totally blow it, but ultimately it doesn't do enough to stand on it's own or add to the original.\n\nWHAT I LIKED:\n\n- Visually beautiful. The Mary Poppins story told with 2018 special effects adds the perfect touch to make the fantasy scenes truly spectacular.\n- The animated scene in the bowl was particularly well done using a great vintage animation-style you don't see often any more. I especially liked the hand-drawn style of the wardrobe in that scene.\n- Emily Blunt is superb with impossible shoes to fill. But she is the perfect balance of serious and playful.\n- The costumes and set design over-all were very well done. The movie was a visual treat the entire time.\n\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:\n\n- These characters are all VERY quick to just accept Mary Poppins is here for apparently no reason. No one was trying to hire a nanny. The kids seem to have been very independent for quite some time. It's all rather random.\n- Meryl Streep's scene was a complete waste-of-time, except to give her an excuse to be cartoonishly over-the-top.\n- I didn't care about ANY of the songs! The best part of the original was the catchy songs burned in our brains. I couldn't name one song from the new one as I left the theater. Nothing to sing along to, no \"Step In Time\" or \"Spoonful of Sugar.\" All I picture in my head is endless singing about\u00e2\u00a6 whatever. Just didn't stick. This is perhaps the biggest failure of the movie. Looked great but I just didn't connect with any of the songs. It's a musical following one of the most beloved family musicals of all time, and they made forgettable songs no one will remember. It is no surprise that none of the songs in this movie got nominated for any awards.\n- The forced integration was a little blatant. I agree movie casts need to be more diverse. But this really felt like shoehorning in people of color in to 1930s England just to fill some kind of quota.\n- Obsession with the bank and money was the opposite of the original. What happened to enjoy life? Now it's be smarter about your finances? And Mary Poppins didn't solve anything. She merely distracted the children from bothering their father from searching for a stock note. In the end, money falls from nowhere and we're done. Huh?\n- The father, Michael, claimed to be an artist but they showed no interest in art or pursuing that as a career. How did he survive that long with three kids? Where is his art? Why does HE need to be reminded to enjoy life? He's already is living creatively according to him, but has to work in the bank part time. He doesn't quit his job in the end or become a better artist. Their problems just go away and all is well. Pointless.\n\nI imagine this movie will be forgotten just like \"Return to Oz\" and more recently \"Oz\" have both faded in to obscurity instead of building on a classic. Instead of mining classic movies from 55 years ago, an original movie would have been a better way to go. Then there would be no pressure of living up to the original. Ultimately it was just too much to live up to and it didn't make it.",

            "content": "Sequels to movies from 50 years ago are a dicey proposition that even the most cynical of studios balk at. Not so, for the House of Mouse, apparently. Of course, they have a better track record than most for \"sticking the landing\" with all their infinite resources and competent producers. While we certainly didn't need it and no one asked for it, Mary Poppins Returns does just that. We are treated to an airy and colorful excursion that contains a moral center and a message that is sorely missing from children's cinema these days. This follow-up takes place a couple of decades after the original classic. The Banks children are grown up and broke in the middle of the Great Depression and are about to lose their childhood home. Michael himself now has children and has need of a nanny (and moral guidance). Guess who shows up?\n\nThis sequel would live or die based upon the performance and casting of its recognizable character. Emily Blunt proves to be an excellent fit for the magical caregiver, albeit a tad bit more vain and prickly than the Julie Andrews version. Supposedly this was because Blunt opted to take it in direction more akin to the novel version originated by P.L. Travers. This is one of those broad PR statements that's hard to prove one way or another, and I suspect this defense was created in hindsight. Either way she kills it with the charm and sharp wit one would expect. (Btw Emily Blunt is actually REALLY good in the few action movies she's been in. I don't know why Hollywood has not made her action star.) The interplay she has with the children is quaint and you feel some of that old Disney magic in many of their fantastic interludes. It was nice to see hand-drawn animation for one of the more memorable sequences, though some of the CGI used in others was a bit...umm terrible. The musical numbers themselves are...decent but not exceptional or ones that you'll be singing years later. The famous songs from the original were scored and written by the Sherman Brothers, who were masters of their craft. There's simply no comparison between the two.\n\nThere are numerous supporting characters and a lot of cameos to be had. Lin Manuel-Miranda really shines and he fills in nicely for Dick Van Dyke. Emily Mortimer is quite lively and charming, while Ben Whishaw carries a lot of the dramatic work of the film. Meanwhile Colin Firth is a little TOO good as a slimy villain. Overall, Mary Poppins Returns is a fine family outing and has the right magic to pull off the impossible. That being said, WE DON'T NEED ANYMORE. This was FINE. In Russian Roulette you can get two clicks and survive. It doesn't mean you get THREE. And yeah that analogy was pretty dark for a review of a Disney movie. Don't lie. That's why you read my reviews.",

            "content": "This was an unmitigated disaster! A series of non-stop nails on a chalkboard moments.\n\nA little context if you find my opinion harsh. A) I love musicals and B) I love the original Mary Poppins. In my opinion, this movie failed in both respects.\n\nI was flabbergasted to find this movie had such high reviews on rotten tomatoes. I'd heard from a friend that they basically just redid the scenes from the original movie. (And boy was she right). However, it's called \"Mary Poppins Returns\" so I was expecting them to use more original material from one of P.L. Traverse's many other Mary Poppins sequels.\n\nThere were so many good ones to choose from!\n\nMary Poppins Comes Back\nMary Poppins Opens the Door\nMary Poppins in the Park\nThe Gingerbread Shop\nMr. Wigg's Birthday Party\nMary Poppins From A-Z\nMary Poppins in the Kitchen\nMary Poppins in Cherry Tree Lane\nMary Poppins and the House Next Door\nI've read the the first 4 books in the series and all of them are unique and special. The imagination is what sets The Mary Poppins series apart from other books. While Mary Poppins herself sees little character development, you get to see a different side of her in each story. I felt like this movie just rehashed all the qualities we already know about her...but not as well as the original!\n\nNevertheless I loved the original for what it was. You can't beat Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins. Then you have Dick Van Dyke. So much great musical talent packed into one movie. The movie doesn't capture the wistfulness of the books entirely, but they at least it captures the creativity and imagination of the original Mary Poppins book.\n\nThen you have this movie. Which barely tries to be original or do anything new! Instead they take each scene from the movie and basically create a mediocre version of it.\n\nThere was no energy in this movie! Musicals require lots of paunch and pizazz and ENERGY. Where the heck was the enthusiasm? I felt like it just dragged on and on. The most energy in the entire movie was when 91-year-old Dick Van Dyke entered and busted out the snazziest little number of the entire film. Unfortunately, that magic lasted about 3 minutes then it was back to the lackluster performances of the rest of the cast.\n\nIt was like they tried to recreate the original movie which has that often cheesy/over-the-top Broadway quality to it. However, they failed to bring it over-the-top. There was no charisma to this movie. Musicals need charisma, energy, and expressiveness to pull off the sorts of cheesy lines they contain.\n\nAlso, WHY are Jane and Michael the adults in this one? They tried to fit them into the mother and father roles of the previous move and it didn't fit. The lines were awkward and were delivered awkwardly. The only one who did a decent job was the actress who played Mary Poppins. Everyone else was...wooden in their portrayals. I think this is mainly due to the fact that there's little conflict driving this movie. They try to mimic the old story, but they do it poorly. In my opinion, the creators should have scrapped trying to mimic the original movie and gone in a completely new direction.\n\nAll their attempts at recreating the magical, spectacularly colorful dance scenes fell flat. The music was a poor shadow of the original songs, and so unmemorable I literally can't remember any of them.\n\nThen you have Linuel Miranda, he's a Broadway star, right? The only place he shone was in a scene where he was rap/singing a song. Otherwise, he just did not cut it as Bert's replacement.\n\nThen you have these \"lamplighters\" or something whose job is to light streetlamps. I don't understand why the city needed so many of them. It's not like it's that tedious or difficult to turn a light on and off. Those chimney sweeps though, that was a hard job. Replacing them with these lamplighters seemed a little pathetic to me.\n\nI simply don't know when was the last time I saw something so boring. What am I missing? What did everyone else see in this that I couldn't? THEY BUTCHERED MARY POPPINS for crying out loud. This is a crime against humanity. Honestly.\n\nDisney needs to stop creating sequels. It just keeps getting worse, and goodness knows when it will end. What happened to think up something new? That's what Disney was known for. He took fairytales and turned them into something unique and new. Where is that creative spirit?",

As this is the case, anyone can guess how excited I was to see this sequel for the first, which I totally was. It started off with an original music number, which made me super excited for the rest of the film. Unfortunately, however, as the film progressed, the more disappointed I became. The special effects were exactly what I expected for a Mary Poppins movie with roughly 60 years of improved technology: nothing short of amazing. There were two scenes that were the pinnacle of the disappointment. The main offense was the \u00e2cover is not the book\u00e2? scene. The song was not what I expected from a Mary Poppins film (although the Hamilton-style Lin Manuel Miranda solo was awesome) and it felt like they were making fun of the animated penguins (which were one of my favorite things about the original). On the other hand, I enjoyed the old-school-style animation of that scene. The other misfire was the Topsy number. It felt out of place and you can\u00e2(TM)t ruin any character, let alone Mary Poppins, by telling everyone that that character has such a creepo for a cousin. That being said, the bank taking property is, in my opinion, an overused conflict, however I liked how the banker was actually evil, along with the Dick Van Dyke cameo. This brings me to my next point: Lin-Manuel Miranda, though I love his Hamilton and In the Heights productions, was no Bert-substitute. And the Michael actor didn\u00e2(TM)t look like the kid in the original, but besides that, the casting was well done. Though Mary Poppins Returns was a bit underwhelming, it was still an enjoyable experience\u00e2\"at the times that didn\u00e2(TM)t fall flat.",

In Mary\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s care, the Banks children meet the King of the Castle and the Dirty Rascal, visit the upside-down world of Mr. Turvy and his bride, Miss Topsy, and spend a breathless afternoon above the park, dangling from a clutch of balloons.\" So the ideas for the movie really are inspired from the book and not a rehash of the 1964 movie.",

Besides that though, there's just enough joy and fun moments to get through, dragged down by a poor script and a resolution that basically makes the character of Mary Poppins unimportant in her own movie.",

            "content": "About what I expected. Don't get me wrong this wasn't a bad movie, but it was lacking in a few places and I found the run time to be horrendous. This is a direct sequel to Mary Poppins (1964) and is set roughly 25 years after the events of the first film. Michael (Ben Whishaw) and Jane Banks (Emily Mortimor) are now grown up. Michael has three children Anabel (Pixie Davis), John (Nathanael Saleh) and Georgie (Joel Dawson). Michael lives with his three kids and Ellen (Julie Waters) their maid (who was also in the first film, but of course played by a different actress). Michael's wife passed away and since then he's turned away from making art and is now working as a teller. Jane is working toward bettering low income workers (much like her mother was helping out all the time in the first film). One day the bank comes by and tells Michael he's missed out on three months worth of payment for their house, so unless he can get the entire loan paid off in 5 days, or find proof of them owning shares of the bank...they will lose their house! Distraught from all of this in comes Mary Poppins (Emily Blunt). Mary arrives just in time to get the Banks children old and new back into shape and to help them realize whats most important. The children have grown up too quick and need a reminder on how to have fun and some other important life lessons. Along for the ride as well is a lamplighter worker named Jack (Lin-Manuel Miranda) who has a connection in a ways to the family. First the good. There are some very catchy songs to this one and even now I am humming them a bit. Are they as catchy or legendary as \"Let's Fly a Kite\" from the first film? No not really, but I overall enjoyed them. I really enjoyed Emily Blunt's performance. She jumped into the source material more and supposedly her version of Mary Poppins is much closer to the version that the books entail. She has a charm to her and really fits the roll well. I had no issue with her taking over from the great performance that Julie Andrews did in the original film. I still have two big gripes here. First off the movie runs much too long. I know its a musical, but man clocking in at 2 hours and 10 minutes is a bit of a stretch here for me (especially when it has a pretty simple plot). I found a lot of the scenes were rehashes from the original film (there's an animated section, a section where the lamplighters sing, a section where Mary's teaching a good manner or cleaning song, etc). There were 3 scenes in particular I thought could have been cut completely from the film and would have helped the pacing of the film (visiting Mary's cousin, the lamplighters songs and the balloon song at the end) all three of these went on way too long and don't even add much to the story (outside of the balloon song). I enjoy musicals and director Rob Marshall has made some really solid one's that I like including Chicago (2002) & Into The Woods (2014), but for this one I think he stretched it out a bit too far. I would have loved to see more background on Mary, but I get it that she's suppose to be mysterious and all. My only other gripe is the plot here is incredibly predictable and I just found myself kind of wondering when the movie would end about an hour in (much to my surprise I wasn't even half way done). It's very by the book and for the most part it just doesn't capture the charm of the former. It's close don't get me wrong, but this one would be a stretch for me to watch again because of the length of it and the fact that overall I didn't have as much fun with it as I thought I would have. If you're a mega fan of the original I would say check it out if you aren't I would say wait to rent it!",

The characters in 1964 film were much more believable in their emotions and expressions that one can relate to. The pace of this film however was much faster, louder, and a bit too smiley dramatic /exaggerated for my taste. The only characters that showed a little bit more authenticity was Jacks character and sister Jane. Nice to see Van Dyck, Angela Landsbury and the first and last songs were nice to watch, my daughter liked the ballon song out of all of them. Otherwise, the songs were un-memorable, we still would rather sing \"Lets go Fly a Kite\" \"Stepping Time\" and \"Votes for Women\". For this film, they should have taken a much more critical eye in toning down the Broadway feel that came across both forced and too sensational. The kids I really could not stand and made me think of Dick and Jane books for some reason. Cutting out a song number or two may have helped for starters. One element that really did not help the film and distracted viewers from the story line was the villainous animated characters or scene, it was an unnecessary twist hat did not go with the movies message or theme. This did not happen in the original film and any scary points in the original were more believable like when Jane and Michael encounter strangers and a dog when they are lost. I found the kidnapping animated scene to be a waste of time and just bad taste. If Walt was here I think there would be plenty of edits and better casting choices. I give some credit in the colorful costumes and animation and the way Mary Poppins entered with audiences to magical scenes like the bathtub and porcelain bowl were well executed. I wish Blunt had been a bit more approachable (as Mary Poppins Julie Andrews was) Blunt seemed  more sour in personality and should have aimed for the warmth that Andrews mastered together with the confidence and sassiness/ smarts that the Poppins character embodies.  For the villan of the movie, his balloon doesn't go up (I found that this could have been better thought out...yes he deserved it...but even the \"mean bankers\" of the original film, had a redemptive quality about them and in the end, event they enjoyed a kite flying experience. I hope Disney can be smarter to bring more authenticity and less showy or forced smiles or scenes in future films like this. I agree with the New York Times review on this and give it a 2 1/2 star.  In the end, thanks for the remake attempt but you could do a lot better story wise.",

            "content": "As much as I loved Julie Andrews' Mary Poppins, Emily Blunt is the charm of this movie. She does a fantastic job as Mary. From the musical perspective to the acting. She's great in this movie. From the first time we see her as this character to the very last moment, she was excellent and made the movie better. She was her own Mary Poppins.\n\nThe directing is also good. The musical sequences are very well done and very well-choreographed. No surprise there coming from an Academy Award nominee. The cinematography is also beautiful. The movie has some beautiful shots.\n\nThe animation is outstanding. It really is. Words can't express how good it actually is. And the blending between live action and animation is really 'really' well made. It was my favorite aspect of the movie.\n\nThe best thing I can say about the movie is that Mary Poppins Returns is its own movie. It's not trying to throw nods to the original, nor you needed to see the original to understand this one. It's a sequel that stands on its own. And although, there are some few nods, but it doesn't rely on them and feed you of nostalgia. \nThe \"villain\" was meh. He didn't have that much screen time, and from the first moment I saw his character introduced I had a feeling he wasn't to trust, and well, he wasn't. \nMost of the characters I thought were necessary for the film because they had a purpose in it. There's a character named Anabel, which I thought had no purpose in the film. She's the sister of Michael. And her scenes had no impact on the story.\n\nOverall, A movie that can speak to everyone who grew up with the original but also mark the lives of this generation that will grow up with this movie.",

            "content": "Mary Poppins Returns is a charming musical filled to the brim with imagination and whimsy. It is quite entertaining and Emily Blunt is very good as the magical, manners-focused nanny.\n\nThe storyline follows the title character as she returns to the Banks\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM) family home, decades later. Siblings Michael and Jane Banks are grown up. Michael, with kids of his own and mourning the loss of his wife, is about to lose the home that they have lived in since they were children. Poppins descends from the London sky, ready to help the Banks\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM) family with their plight and teach Michael\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)s kids to use their imaginations and improve their manners. The bank has given Michael a few days to pay off his house, setting off a countdown for Poppins, the Banks and a lamplighter named Jack to save the home.\n\nThe story is interesting. Michael Banks has hit rock bottom. His wife has tragically passed away and he\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)s about to lose the home he has lived in since childhood. The only thing that brings him joy is the comfort and company of his family. It\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)s a sad place to start, but it's a great scenario for Mary Poppins to come to work her magic. The idea of losing your home is pretty realistic and the contrast with such a fantastical protagonist and situation, provides an aspect that I quite enjoyed. \n\nEmily Blunt is very good as Mary Poppins. She puts her own twist on the character, yet you can still trace it back to the earlier onscreen depiction of Poppins. Blunt gives the character a sharper, comedic edge. Her Poppins is much more witty and sarcastic, but still gives a sense of compassion and care for those around her. Blunt really dives into the role and cements her portrayal in a charismatic way. She steals the show in nearly every scene.\n\nI recommend Mary Poppins Returns for ages 5 to 18, due to some dark themes. Adults and fans of the original Mary Poppins will enjoy this film. I give it 3.5 out of 5 stars. The film has lots of charm and it\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)s great to see Poppins sail back onto the screen once again. \n\nReviewed by Benjamin P., KIDS FIRST!

Michael's three children come under Mary Poppins' care and she begins to weave her (very real) magic in their lives. Emily Blunt is excellent as Mary Poppins, she owns the role, but I thought she was upstaged by leerie Jack (Lin-Manuel Miranda) who has such charisma on screen. Speaking of upstaged, Meryl Streep has a scene stealer and there are a couple of nice cameos. The film mixes animation and live action very well, in the style of the original. I did think it was a bit too long and while the songs are largely good, some better than others, they aren't memorable like those in the original. Overall it's pretty good wholesome fun.",

Be that as it may, it stands as a perfectly enchanting fantasy on its own right. Pays homage to the original while managing to spin enough magic with this cast and narrative. Emily Blunt offers a take on Mary that differs from the warmth and charm of Andrews, but that is hardly a distraction as it hews closer to the character as presented in the original novels (which is supposedly the launching pad for this film). Magnificent visuals and solid direction make this Rob Marshall's finest work to date. The most frequent and most superfluous of the criticisms seems to be that the songs were forgettable and couldn't hold a candle to the original tunes. What these experts don't realize is that music is highly complex of patterns where familiarity breeds likability. The original Sherman score has had 54 years to burrow itself into the ear of pop culture - obviously, songs you just heard can't hold a candle to that simply by virtue of longevity. Time will be the judge on these new tunes. And, these geniuses who claim there's \"too much singing\" or songs that don't add to the story clearly shouldn't be critiquing musicals. Bit parts from Meryl Streep, the legendary Dick Van Dyke, and the charming Angela Lansbury make this a delightful entry in Disney's live-action cannon with enough heart and poignant sentiment to please age 8 through 80.",

A film where its circumstances and central conceits are ultimately more dire than its predecessor's, there's almost nothing about its musical aspects that's worthy of screentime. The musical numbers only serve to distract the main characters from the central conflict of the film. Mary Poppins as a character is borderline inconsequential to the course of events and the songs themselves are almost entirely unremarkable. Still, as someone who's not necessarily a \"Poppins\" purist, it doesn't bother me all that much. It's just a harmless, silly, disposable junk food film. Don't expect much more than that.",

Trip a Little Light Fantastic has beautiful visuals, but the song itself was just meh. The acting was enchanting. The youngest boy and the little girl were fabulous. Emily Blunt, as Mary, was nearly flawless, only occasionally slipping into a prissiness that felt forced.

Good thing the black dude was  the only decent human being among the evil team, too. Oh, and one of the main characters was a social activist for workers rights aganst evil capitalism. Maybe it was just me, but I found all this distracting and spoon-feed. It is not that in a Mary Poppins kind film I am expecting to see a portrayal of racism, but shoehorning social justic in a film isnt either my cup of tea. Also, I found Mary Poppins to be unlikeable, unlike the original one.  The film seems fond of having the characters struggling against situations, only to reveal their struggles are for naught, because the end result would have been the same anyway. So Mary Poppins manipulates the Big Ben and there was no need to climb  it and finding the certificate was useless, because the old director would have step in all the same to save the day.

Well this time they put down the recent formulas and decided to try one that used to work decades ago, the musical.  There have been many good musicals in history, it seems that many think only animated ones will sell, these days.  No so, as Mary Poppins Returns proves.  The sets are simple and in fact reminiscent of from the original movie.  And because of this simplicity, it would be easy to adopt this to the theater as well.  I will admit the songs aren't as \"catchy\" as many of the originals, but that may be because of how many times I've seen the original.  The singing was wonderful as was the choreography.  The scene where the lamplighters were dancing with their ladders and bicycles was great.\n\nI applaud Disney for not remaking Mary Poppins, but rather making a sequel.  I think I might have resented a reboot.  As this movie deals with the children of the children from the first movie, it allows it to tie in nicely, yet not be ruined by our nostalgia filter from the original.  \n\nWhen Mary first arrives, Jane Banks asks, \"What brings you here after all this time?\"  To which, Mary Poppins replies, \"The same thing that brought me the first time, I've come to look after the the Bank's children.\"  Annabel asks, \"Us?\"  Mary states,  \"Oh yes, you too.\"  Yes, once again, Mary Poppins is here to save a family from the father, Michael Banks, the original bank's son down to his children all of whom have lost wife, mother, and in general their way.\n\nThis movie is a must see for children and for anyone who loves musicals in general.  It's a return to cinematic innocence that should not remain lost.  It pushes no agenda or political messages either.  Well done, Disney.",

I say this speaking from personal experience as I recently lost my mother in the same time frame as the movie and each reference and song on the topic left both myself and my father in tears. \nAlso the actor who plays Jack the gas lamp lighter has the worst fake cockney accent and thus everytime he sings or talks it starts to get on ones nerves. Also this movie is disappointing and a lot of the things that are referenced from the original movie are lost on those who haven't seen the original movie and therefore are unable to understand what each reference means such as when Mary Poppins refers to the sayings next to the heights of herself and the 2 children in the original movie and repeats them in the new movie it leaves one confused if you haven't watched the original movie. In addition little jokes based on her previous movie fall flat without the context or having watched the original movie. This movie did and still has a lot of work needed to be anywhere as good as the original movie, but it does have some fun songs and characters and is thus not a complete failure and the kids will probably have fun watching it but might not understand some of the outdated things like gas lamps that need turning off and on manually each day and night. I could go on further, but I think what I've said should be sufficient for one to understand why this movie could have been better.",

It may be etched familiarity, but I can't help feeling despite the excellent performances of the cast, that the new songs were simply not catchy o'r memorable enough. Throwing in one or two of the classics might just have helped lift this that little bit further. Maybe they needed to watch the original one more time before making the final cut?\n\nAlso, since when does Mary Poppins snap into line with a \"Yes Sir\"?",

The original happens to be one of my favorite Disney movies of all time, so I am biased when I say that nothing could surpass the original. \n\nCons: going with the above thesis, Emily Blunt doesn't have quite the sweet charm as Dame Julie had, showing more of an edge to her mischievous nature. Yet, she is not as tightly wound, it seems, as the original. If you want to call it a \"con,\" this movie basically takes the plot structure of the original movie and plugs in different situations and re-adjusted scenes (compared to the original). But plug-and-play, to me, is not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nPros: I like Mary Poppins, plain and simple. This movie satisfied that appetite for such a movie. It doesn't have the same level of charm as the original, but it is charming in its own right. The music has Richard Sherman's fingerprints all over it - and I find it all the strongest suit of the movie. Marc Shaiman said he didn't want to ape the style of the original. He didn't, but he (and Sherman) captured enough of the tone and style of the old songs - with more of a PG-level sensibility to a couple of them (like my favorite of the movie \"A Cover is not the Book.\") And with that said, I can't say enough of how much I really like watching Lin-Manuel Miranda. He did a workable job as Jack, bad accent and all. And my favorite song even had a bit of Vaudeville-patter-meets-a-touch-of-Hamilton in the middle of it. Some may not enjoy that, but I found it a pleasant surprise. \n\nNot the best movie, certainly not the worst. Given what it is, it's practically perfect in almost every way. I'll definitely be owning this and adding it to my Blu-Ray of the original. I would like to see it again before it leaves the AMC, and I may end up raising the rating on it.",

Mary Poppins is a timeless classic, and it was a very brave move by Disney to do a sequel and they\u2019ve somehow managed to pull it off, well, just about. Emily Blunt is delivers a fine performance as the magical nanny and it must have been a horrendously daunting task to try and fill the shoes of Julie Andrews. Ultimately though she\u2019s doesn\u2019t have that warmth and wonderment that Andrews projected in every scene, and that\u2019s not a fault of Blunt, it\u2019s just the fact that Julie Andrews has that \u201csomething else\u201d that magical indescribable quality which made millions of people fall in love with her. The plot sees Mary Poppins again coming to the aid of the Banks children, the story ties nicely to the original and there are some well choreographed sequences, which include a great Big Ben set climax. Productions values are exemplary and everything looks wonderful and magically. However the major issue I had with it is that 90% of the songs are completely forgettable right from the first song. Intact I\u2019d go as far as to say there\u2019s only 1 decent song in it and that\u2019s right at the end, which is staggering considering that this is a Disney musical. With better songs I think people would have warned to this even more. By the end of it I just wanted to watch the original and I think that\u2019ll be the case for most people. ",

            "content": "For the musical fans.  Many years have passed since Mary Poppins first visited.  The children she once nurtured are now adults with children of their own.  They've stumbled upon some hard times, and much like the Room of Requirement, she reappears because she is needed.  Now I don't have all that much attachment for the original, only the foggiest of recollections of having watched it when I was a very small child, but I still thought that the trailers to this looked terrific, so this made my list of most hotly anticipated movies for year end.  When Christmas finally rolled around and this got released, I had to go check it out at my earliest opportunity.  I did not leave the theater a disappointed man.  Now the most noteworthy thing I have to say about this movie is that it stirred nostalgia within me that I didn't even know existed.  To be perfectly frank, I don't have any memory of the original other than the lyrics and pitter-patter of the most iconic musical numbers, so I loved the fact that this made me realize I was actually missing this character.  Emily Blunt is absolutely the standout in this movie, and she is fantastic.  You can tell that she wanted to be in this role with a passion, and whenever she is onscreen, she commands your attention, and rightfully so.  It is undoubtedly her movie, as her name is in the title, but I do wish she was in it just a bit more.  Her presence is felt for the first two thirds of the film, but she has far less to do when all of the plot threads are being tied up.  This is a musical that is special because it leaves you believing that anything is possible.  It does capture that wonder and spectacle, which is why so many of us go to the movies.  I can't really recall any specific lyrics to songs, which is really the telltale sign between type A and type B of musicals, but I do distinctly remember number with a balloons, or the number with the street lamps, or the number in the bathtub.  To really push it over to that next level, this would need to have something that you walk away singing, or at the very least humming.  Still, if musicals are your thing, I think that you should check this out in a theater, as it will do nothing but brighten your day.",

However Mary Poppins Returns does it better and being much more enjoyable. The hand drawn animation is always welcomed in today's world of CG. Some of the musical numbers are really top notch.

Choosing Emily Blunt put my mind at ease but I still was worried that it might be too difficult to be faithful to the brilliance of the 1964 epic.\n\nThe opening song from Lin-Manuel had beautiful lyrics and the score hinted at 'The Life I Lead' and every song after that had a sneaky dalliance at a melody line from one of the older songs. A wonderful performance by Angela Lansbury was reminiscent of 'Fly a Kite'. \n\nalthough some moments seems random, such as the appearance that Meryl Streep gave which slightly detracted from the story as her character had no impact on the storyline other than she was going to possibly fix a royal doulton bowl.\n\nThat aside, Meryl's song was comedic and linked back to the scene in the Julie Andrews version where they kept laughing so much that they were flying around the house of a randon jolly man ('I love to laugh').\n\nEmily can sing, act and hold an audience's interest with ease. Her charisma is similar but not the same as Julie Andrews. Julie was more about the singing whereas Emily's is about the harshness of the nanny, as told in the P L Travers books that inspired Walt's imagination when he read them with his daughter Diane. Emily holds this role well and has cheeky moments which show her chatacter's real personality.\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda is amazing and does a much better accent than Dick Van Dyke ever had. It is lovely to see Julie Walters as the housekeeper and the grown up Jane and Michael Banks are very credible played by Ben Wishaw and Emily Mortimer. Colin Firth even pops by to play a darker role but hold this well as always.\n\nThe opening credits were in the style of the original with smudged etchings of London draped beneath the cast list and credits. This made me cry straight away as it was true to the 1964 Disney way.\n\nThis movie made me cry as it brought back that Disney feeling and was sweetly made with care and attention.",

Even if she doesn't get Broadway offers, so what?? She is the busiest star these days. This movie was more of hits than misses.. I did not quite like the beginning, it is quite too long as a prelude of the entire movie... not until towards the end, when I heard the same song sung. The merging pf music and spoken dialogues are incredibly fascinating. I guess, it depends on who's actually doing it. This movie is a perfect example of how to do it. Colin Firth playing the wicked chief banker suits him. Angela Lansbury in the end was a big bonus. The entrance of the legendary Dick Van Dyke towards the end of the confrontation between Chief Banker and Michael Banks was very emotional. Great to see him tap his dancing shoes.

Knowing that Travers intensely disliked the first movie and the \"pop\" score, I wondered how director Rob Marshall would approach the movie.  Marshall is a brilliant Broadway director and his filmed version of Chicago reflected his theater aesthetic.  You could feel his expert touch in every aspect of Mary Poppins. First of all, the cast is perfection.  Emily Blunt was an inspired choice -- she is perfect as Poppins.  I have seen Miranda in both his roles on Broadway and he is excellent here in an entirely new dimension for his repertoire.  Ok, maybe the Cockney accent is not his forte but his performance was pure and emotional and his musical numbers were nothing short of amazing. The score was lush and beautifully complex.  And the songs were the same -- complex with utterly clever lyrics.  As in the best of Broadway, the songs emerged from plot and character.  The team resisted the urge to throw in the catchy pop songs that Travers resented.  ;And they were far more moving than the beautiful little trifles that we can all sing from the original.  For the most part, they land in your heart.  They may not all  be \"sing a long\" songs for children but that is also true in the best Broadway shows.  Listening to the album, I was struck again by the music in this film -- they are literally uplifting even the ballad.  There is a reason two of these songs have been short listed for the Oscars.  Overall you leave this movie with your spirit uplifted  There seems to be the DNA of joy incorporated in most every scene. \nI saw this movie with my husband and we loved it so much we went back so we could take some children and we loved it even more seeing it through their eyes.",

Overall it will leave you smiling (especially scenes like A Cover is Not the Book and Trip a Little Light Fantastic).

I'd have hoped they'd give some small nod to the original mother and father in imagery, yet that didn't happen. The mother of the new children passed away and we don't know exactly when or why, but the story isn't about that or healing that loss. It's about them being in a predicament caused by the father wanting to be an artist and running out of money so he mortgages the house. In doing so he puts their place of living in danger and the movie is all worry with Mary being a pacifier, but not offering to be a fix, to the children as we forget about the lost mother and focus on how to find a stock certificate that would pay to fix the problem. The villain being a banker that for \"reasons\" tore out the page with the recored of the stock and tossed it in his fire place throws me, as they could have easily said his family had a beef with the Banks or that the bank needed every house it could get as the depression was putting a squeeze on money... but no... they just decided he was going to rip out a page and toss it in the fire, no motivation given, villain created. In the end, the moral is the diametrically apposed opposite of the original movie, and michael learns that love is not the answer, feeding birds with your tuppens is stupid when you need every cent you've got to hold on to your home. Had they lost the house and shown the family happy in a smaller apartment perhaps, that would have been a heartwarming classic Disney Scenario. In this, it was the house has to be saved so they can all be happy. And it was. Moral of the story: Money fixes everything",

I was expecting that wonderful, emotional, roller coaster ride that takes one on a fantastic journey for a few hours, and instead it was more like a catastrophic train wreck. The theater was jam-packed, but throughout the movie, the audience was noticably quiet. No \"ooh's or ahh's\", laughter, not even a giggle.    \nThe character of Mary Poppins was not \"spot on\"', which is critical to the believability of her return as herself.  The original Mary Poppins was a firm nanny, but she was also witty, charming, and lovable. When she returns, she is not the happy, imaginative, fun-loving Mary we are expecting. Mary (Emily Blunt) is unlikeable, arrogant, snotty, conceited, and appears to be annoyed all the  time. This is the biggest flaw in the movie. When Mary returns, if the timeline we're correct, it would be in the late 1930's or early 40's, but they are still wearing clothing from the 1900's, except for Jane, who wears trousers in some scenes. Go figure! Even more confusing, were the \"adventures\" of Mary and the three children.  It was like a bad, hallucinogenic trip through a \"mish mash\" of old Disney movies, from Alice in Wonderland to Peter Pan! The music was forgettable; although I can vaguely recall one song because it was so out of place. It had a psuedo rap beat, and Mary even used the word \"boombastic\", (perhaps she saying \"bombastic\", but it sure sounded like \"boombastic\") The real Mary Poppins would have put her in the naughty chair! \nFor me, this movie was not entertaining or enjoyable, and if you're looking for a \"feel-good\", fun, family movie, don't waste your money on this one.",

Most of the other actors, especially the children, were humdrum at best. You can definitely see that they are trying and putting l lot of effort, but mostly it fell flat; even Meryl Streep felt out of place and I wished for her scene to quickly end.

After all, recreating the magic of the first film, including brilliant performances from such legends as Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke, seems like an impossible feat. Still, I was eager to see what Rob Marshall and Disney would do with the sequel to the beloved first movie. Add in the fact that Lin-Manuel Miranda, one of my favorite humans ever, played a prominent role in the movie, and I was really pumped to see it. I can now say, without a doubt, that I was not disappointed in the slightest. The music was spectacular, the set designs were stunning, and the performances by Emily Blunt and Lin Manuel-Miranda did not disappoint. While it is fair to say that Blunt did not quite match Julie Andrews' stellar performance, I have to ask: who could? Blunt was spectacular in her own way and fully captured the magic one expects from a Mary Poppins movie. The songs in the movie were also great, my personal favorite being \"A Cover is Not the Book\" with singing by both Blunt and Miranda. Musical films hold a special place in my heart, with movies such as \"The Greatest Showman\" and \"La La Land\" frequenting on my Spotify playlist. After seeing Mary Poppins Returns, I have no doubt that it too will make an appearance on my playlist at some point. Overall, Mary Poppins Returns is fun, creative, and brings the magic from the first film into the film world of the 21st century, while maintaining its family-friendly nature.",

I will say I have a soft spot for Mary Poppins and Saving Mr Banks. I love both movies dearly and need to go back and see Mary Poppins Returns a second time. \n\nIt feels just like the orginal and I'll explain why in a second. First let me get a few critiscims I've seen out of the way.\n\n1. The music is still good and has not changed from a theory or compostion stand point.\n2.  Meryl Streep waa awful. Easily the only part lf the movie I would have skipped. Just like i dont like the nanny song in the original. \n3. Manuel won't have a good english accent becuase he ain't bloody english mate! Dick Van Dyke isn't a Brit either. His accent is just as bad. Only  Brits will have a true accent and tone.\n\nOkay so logistically you're seeing the same movie as the first but this time she's there to save Michael and his family instead of the late Mr. Banks. \n\nThere is a silly song, a cartoon segment, a lullaby,  a sad song or two, a moving piece a  big swing number, etc. It's all there. It follows similar arc and then the big finish with the happy go lucky tune.\n\nBesides Meryl Streep song and attrocious Russian accent it's a perfect musical in every way. Emily Blunt may be the only person who could nail this role. She deserves best actress in a lead role here.\n\nMusic for this was writtent by a composer who knows musicals and boy does it pay off. He even had the old Richard Sherman on as a consultant from the orginal music that he wrote. So all those saying it's all trash are just full of it. And okay Manuel has a spoken word poem in one song. He wrote Hamilton everyone. He's going to have wrap a song in anything he does so get over it. Plus many of the songs follow similar thematic patterns and even hint at the originals with certain chord changes, meter and plain direct notes from the melodies. All together very tasteful and memorable. Not every song has to be memorable but I loved Can You Imagine That which is a reworking and homage to Spoon Full of Sugar. I also loved the Leary's song Trip little Light Fantastic and the main theme, the lovely London Sky. The ending song and Lullaby in the middle were also catching and great.\n\nAngela Lansbury and Dick Van Dyke had great cameos that added to the wonderment,  not saved it.  Believe me the movie would still be moving without them but they defintiely helped ice the cake.\n\nGo see it and go enjoy it!  Have fun  with it!  Don't analyze every last detail. Remember when alls done, there's no where to go but up!",

I like the kids because they\u00e2(TM)re more behaved than the kids in the other films.\n\tBut the main bad guy just feels \u00e2\" overused.  When he appears on screen, most people will know who he is \u00e2\" and why he does what he does.  SCORE: 7\n\nPlot\n\tThis movie is a musical, not a drama or adventure tale.  And as a musical, I think it works because the songs are fun to listen to and the dancing sequences are inventive.  \n\tStill, this film does feel bloated, and how the main conflict gets resolved is one big problem I have with the film.  SCORE: 7\n\nOriginality\n\tIf you\u00e2(TM)ve seen any other Mary Poppins film, then you\u00e2(TM)ve likely seen this one.  But the musical sequences do have some originality in them.  SCORE: 7\n\nViolence Factor\n\tUm, not in this film.  These people use their words instead of weapons or fists.  But I think that Mary Poppins\u00e2(TM) magic is a little to powerful.  SCORE: 8\n\nOther Moral Issues\n\tThis film is all about looking at problems from a different angle to see the solution.  But that message is totally mishandled near the end of the film.  SCORE: 7\n\nFinal Score (out of 60): 44\t\t% Score: 73.33%\n\tThis film works \u00e2\" as long as it\u00e2(TM)s clear that it\u00e2(TM)s a musical.",

This is a kids movie  for sure but if you are an adult who is a kid at heart or at least still in touch with your inner child, this is a great film.

            "content": "Many reviews appear to be centered on the idea that Mary Poppins Returns is a reboot, rather than a continuation based on the other books in the Mary Poppins series by author P. L. Travers. However, this is most certainly not a rewrite or retake of the original Mary Poppins flick, which was itself a mismatch of more than one of the books by Travers.\n\nThe issues with the movie are down to a lack of coherency in the direction rather than the script or the musical performances. Mary Poppins was created as a musical, and Mary Poppins Returns is no different. The main difference in the quality of the two when compared with each other, is the direction. In the first Mary Poppins film, it was directed in the manner of a Hollywood movie. Mary Poppins Returns appears to be directed as if it is a stage show, with classic Hollywood production value.\n\nThe production quality of Mary Poppins Returns makes it a visual tour-de-force. The lighting, color palate, and costumery are woven into a stunning presentation second to none in the current holiday box office run. \n\nEmily Blunt simply shines as the Practically Perfect Poppins, and clearly did not seek to imitate Julie Andrews portrayal, while Lin-Manuel Miranda also shone in his role of Jack. The two had good chemistry throughout and their voices could not have complimented each other any better. The only change I would have liked to see as far as their performances are concerned, would be that the character Jack should have overly-accentuated the bad cockney accent as Dick Van Doik had done in the first Mary Poppins movie. \n\nSpeaking of Dick Van Dyke, it was an absolute pleasure to see him reprise his role from the first film. He has said that when he was on set he very much felt the spirit of the first film, so the myriad of professional critics claiming that their childhood has been somehow sullied by the \"reboot\" that's actually simply a sequel, should remove their fingers from their keyboards and log-off since the most qualified person in the room, Van Dyke himself, closed that door.\n\nThere have been concerns made regarding the \"Trip a Little Light Fantastic\" and LSD/Timothy Leary connection, which  is pure fiction. Tripping the light fantastic was a turn-of-last-century phrase referring to dancing on stage, and as early as 1908 it was already considered passe'. In addition to this, \"leerie\" was a word of Scots origin in the 1800's and meant the pole used to light a gas lamp; something many a reviewer failed to discover. Leeries was a term subsequently used for those who's job entailed lighting and snuffing gas street lights while also performing their duty as watchmen.\n\nMary Poppins Returns is entertaining, the main characters of Poppins and Jack entertaining, the hand-drawn animation sequences lucious and vibrant, and the attention to production second to none.\n\nThe only criticism should be levied toward the direction. What could have been a thoroughly seamless film, was hampered by a poor Director. Even with this being said, the flaws are not fatal, but they do hamper Mary Poppins Returns from achieving the same greatness as the first. Sequels are notoriously likely to never as good as the first, but there was a real possibility here that was squandered by the Director.",

This will be enjoyed more by poeple who haven't read the books. I remember doing a book report about the under sea series of Mary Poppins which was far more entertaining than a bunch of characters falling in the bathtub but nothing much happens after that because Walt disney doesn't have the imagination of the author.  It's a  poor sequel of the original Walt disney Mary Poppins show made for and by walt disney to make money but not at all faithful to the books.

Not so much after this movie. Then there is Emily Blunt, who wouldn't know charm if it slapped her in her face. She seriously lacks charm. All I get from her is stone cold bitch. She brings none of the charm that Andrews brought to the character. Again, I like Lin Manuel Miranda and find him to be a talented writer, I feel he should stick to writing, as his acting, singing and dancing leave much to be desired. While I was very excited to see this film, I found it boring, charmless, and regrettable. I had to go and watch Saving Mr Banks, and the original Mary Poppins to take the bad taste out of my mouth.

The entire cast is at the top of its game, but the film belongs to Emily Blunt. Charming, charismatic and utterly unforgettable, she manages to do justice to the iconic role.

Perhaps it was just darker in general than the the original.  Certainly a mother's death is harder subject matter than the threatened loss of a job which was actually a wake up call in the original.  I actually liked the story line of Mary Poppins Returns better but the musical numbers were just not as engaging.  I think the music was darker, instead of a laughing uncle as in the original, MPR features a very strange cousin.  The leary number was darker and less engaging than the chimney sweep number, even the animated world singing number was darker.  The casting was brilliant, the music was performed well but the only standout number to me was \"The Place Where Lost Things Go\".  The rest of the music felt pretty forgettable.

Emily Blunt really does the role justice and It was also nice to see a positive representation of a father figure these days. My only criticisms are that some of the songs run a bit long and the overrated Meryl Streep tries to jump in on the fun only making it odd, but with a Dancing 93 year old Dick Van Dyke at the climax of the film you will truly be left in a state of wonder thinking that the magic is actually real.",

It has the same magic and enchanting immersion, and is a feel-good ride with some welcome tension in between. The plot doesn't feel pointless and has some meaning that connects it to the original. \n\nThe characters really sell it, each actor performing their parts perfectly. Mary Poppins is as magical and mysterious as always. Jack does a wonderful job as a sort of successor to Bert the chimney sweep. The new Banks children are amazing, feeling both mature enough to connect to older audiences while simultaneously being innocent enough to connect with a younger audience as well as everything in between. The old Banks kids, all grown up, feel perfectly placed in this world and are a convincing next step from the originals. There are a few surprise returning characters, but I'd rather just say go watch it to find out who those are.\n\nThe music is absolutely fantastic as well. The musical scenes are just as wonderful as the original film, if not more so. The choreography is simply magical and a downright treat.\n\nTL;DR: Overall, I am surprised by the amazing performance, and for once I am glad I was so horribly wrong to doubt this film. I highly recommend it, to both those who saw and loved the original and those who have never experienced it before. You won't regret it.",

The movie did a good job of following both the Banks children and the adults. My personal favorite scene was when they were all singing Trip a Little Light Fantastic and dancing in the park.

The plot is similar to the first, flushed out with new characters and endearing songs that nod to those of the first movie. The best way I could put it is instead of Kites there are Balloons, instead of chimney sweeps there are Lamp Lighters. And yet, while a practically perfect copy in every way, it falls short of its predecessor all because of the ending. Through Mary Poppins adventures with the children we are given some opportunities for continuity, an important note torn up in the fire, a broken vase that takes up a considerable amount of time. Some of the songs explore deeper problems, \u00e2A Cover Is Not the Book being an excellent example! However while the first movie explored real world problems like poverty, addiction, classism, no such depth is ever attained. Meanwhile Jane and Michael are working to secure access to their fathers bank trust, the central plot of the entire story. As the climax approaches one wonders how all these little clues will work together until\u00e2\u00a6 it happens. The characters are not successful in fulfilling the plot. To save the day a charming cameo of Dick Van Dyke introduces Deus Ex Machina that in less than 30 seconds of screen time rips all of the previous movie to shreds. What we are left with is the realization that none of the tension up to that point was legitimate. I took personal disappointment that said Deus Ex Machina took the form of Michaels saved toppins, so much for \u00e2Feeding the Birds\u00e2?. However, an extremely critical flaw that cannot be overlooked, Mary Poppins effectively has no effect on the plot. Her character might as well be cut out of the story and it would do nothing. What happened to the vase? The letter? Why was she here at all? If the ending could be recut I fully believe this would be a fantastic movie, it truly is a lesson in the power of a single point of failure.",

            "content": "Many people believe movies from years ago don't seem to age well, but I've never bought into that notion. Personally, if it doesn't hold up in terms of today's standards, then it simply deserves to be called a product of its time. Mary Poppins has become that for me. I love watching the original film, but even I have to admit that being released over 50 years ago is a bit of a stretch when you hope something holds up. In the early days of visual effects, it truly shot for the stars, and for its time, there is no denying that. I had high hopes for this 2018 sequel in Mary Poppins Returns, due to the fact that movies have endless possibilities in terms of visual effects nowadays. In short, this is a movie well-worth making, but I don't quite think it will be among everyone's favourites of the year or anything like that.\n\nPicking up many years after the original, Mary Poppins Returns sees the return of the classic (titular) character as she once again arrives to serve the Banks children. Now fully grown with children of their own, Michael has been taking care of his kids with his sister Jane after the passing of his wife. Arriving just on time to relieve some stress from Michael, Mary Poppins becomes the new nanny to these children, taking them on fantastically fun adventures. Filled with great musical numbers and cameos that would brighten anyone's day, this is a late sequel that definitely deserved the spotlight. That being said, this movie isn't perfect in my eyes.\n\nDisney films have begun forming this new formula that seems to string across many of their franchises lately. I'm not saying I dislike this, but the similarities are a little too familiar, to me at least. The original cast has grown up and the film is passing the baton to the newer generation. That's definitely one way of continuing your franchise, but that can't be done again decades from now, because it'll probably just feel tired. I could be wrong about that (which I have been many times), but that's just how I see it. Where this movie undeniably steals everyone's hearts is in its cast and overall atmosphere. With a few casting changes, this movie could've been a disaster, but not this time.\n\nTo start, I've always been a fan of Emily Blunt as an actress. I think she has tremendous talent and I was ready to call her one of the best of 2018 when I watched A Quiet Place at the beginning of the year, but that opinion has slightly altered. Mary Poppins Returns is the film that she's been destined to be cast in. Many people said that nobody could touch Julie Andrews, and while I wouldn't say her performance is better, it seems as though Julie Andrews came back through time and performed this character again. Emily Blunt is a true wonder on-screen here. From the incredible sequences involving Lin-Manuel Miranda to emotional moments involving Ben Whishaw and Emily Mortimer, everything about this film was impeccably cast. For that reason alone, I enjoyed this movie from start to finish.\n\nIn the end, Marry Poppins Returns may not feature as many memorable songs and some may even seem like slight rehashes of the previous ones, but it's great for all ages to experience. From life lessons involving death in the family to just pure silliness in the land of cartoons, this movie provides everything that kids should be experiencing, all at once. If you're a fan of the original film or simply want to smile at the theatre, I definitely recommend checking out Mary Poppins Returns. This very late sequel was worth the wait. I don't believe it will be remembered as a classic in 20 years from now, but that shouldn't deter you for a second.",

This offering does justice to the original by not ruining its legacy, thanks to the excellent production values, fine performances and an enjoyable soundtrack that, unlike so many contemporary musicals, isn't totally forgettable. Emily Blunt pays perfect homage to the legendary character and is worthy of whatever acclaim that comes her way, and kudos are definitely due a fine cast of supporting players. The film is, unfortunately, somewhat episodic, using the narrative between musical numbers mostly as a bridge to link the songs to one another. Otherwise, though, this is a capably made and surprisingly delightful release.",

            "content": "\"One thing you should know about Mary Poppins: she never explains anything\".\n\nThis movie had a lot to live up with it being a sequel to a beloved classic. While I've seen the original movie on repeat as a child - it never had that massive impact on me like everyone else, but with each re-watch I found more enjoyment and appreciation for everything that went into it.\n\nSo this being a sequel made me curious and wary; I went into this expecting nothing to avoid any disappointment. I sat down, arms crossed and waited patiently for the trailers to be over. When it started, the first 10 or 20 minutes was fine, but I was still critical. After the first musical number \"Can You Imagine That?\", I started to warm up a bit and relax more.\n\nHowever, halfway through the movie I noticed something about myself - there was tears streaming down my cheeks, and for a rare moment, I breathed a sigh of relief and enjoyed the ride. This is the first time in awhile I would call my experience escapism.\n\nEmily Blunt was an absolute delight as Mary Poppins. Blunt never imitations Julie Andrews portrayal and makes the role her own. I honestly couldn't think of anyone else to fill in the shoes of the character than Blunt. Her sassy and deadpan wit makes this super nanny pure magic.\n\nThe other cast members were also solid: Lin-Manuel Miranda delivers a theatrical performance that elevates the films charm and brought a smile to my face. Ben Whishaw, on the other hand, was so heartbreaking as the grieving Michael Banks. You can feel the pain and stress in his voice. Emily Mortimer is good as Jane Banks , but felt under-use and didn't offer anything to the story.\n\nAlso Dick Van Dyke dance scene, while short, was unbelievable. He's got more energy than any wanna be dancer, and he's 93 years old.\n\nRob Marshall gives the movie a Broadway-like touch similar to his previous work. The musical sequences with songs like \"Nowhere to Go But Up\" and \"Can You Imagine That?\" being colorful and a blast to watch, which adds to the escapism. The production design and choreography - mwah. He also tackles the more serious elements where the emotions from the characters are expressed through songs and the performances.\n\nFor issues: The songs themselves while fun, yet not super memorable and doesn't hold a candle to the 1965 film. After the movie was over, the songs didn't stick with me as I hoped. This might change over time.\n\nThe main villain played by Colin Firth is so cliched and cartoonist. I started to question why a movie like this needs a bad-guy - although I guess the climax needed to be more intense. He's even got a twirling mustache. When the character first appears on screen, I knew straight away there was something unpleasant about him and the foreshadowing involving an animated sequence was so painfully obvious. His character could have be great if it was written better.\n\nMeryl Streep short appearance is so pointless and could've easily been cut out from the final daft. I wasn't sure what accent she was going for.\n\nOverall rating: It's not flawless, yet it wasn't an abomination like some expected it to be. I would go as far to call it a satisfying sequel.\n\nPerhaps we've learned when day is done, some stuff and nonsense could be fun.",

A lot of these negative reviews are clearly from people who didn't know what kind of movie Mary Poppins was. Clearly if you don't enjoy musicals you will not enjoy this film but for those that do, you should find this one enjoyable. It includes a few callbacks to the original and I believe it definitely does it justice. The downside is that no songs are as memorable as \"Spoonful of Sugar\" or \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\". Should be a great film to get children into musicals either way though.",

Good thing his youngest's kite caught on a magical nanny and brought Mary Poppins back just in time. Comparison to the unbeatable and iconic original is inevitable, though the advantage of brand recognition also means that there is a substantial locked in and critic-proof audience for this sequel. Blurring the line between remake and sequel, director and co-writer, Rob Marshall, who's very familiar with the genre, follows the original's formula and replicate it in fastidious detail. Everything from set design to casting is immaculately and calculatingly executed. The new tunes, as catchy and hummable as they are, all contain DNA traceable back to those beloved songs from 1964. And even the narrative follow the original's beat by beat, with the same animated fantasy detours (in a similar 2D Disney manner), and for every Uncle Albert before, there is a Cousin Topsy now. So while they all look spit-spot and shiny, they do lean towards the derivative (except for one innovative bathtime sequence which hints at what a more daring approach can produce). Emily Blunt has the biggest baggage to carry but despite a slightly frosty and smirky portrayal, her Poppins proves to be one we can all rally behind. In the end, these films have always been episodic adventures set to musical numbers hanging on the slimmest of narrative structures, and ultimately, nostalgia wins the day and it will take a stern hard-hearted cynic not to be grinning and humming like an enchanted infant after experiencing such a joyous film. Now, can you imagine that?",

            "content": "\"Mary Poppins Returns,\" as a show, is less than the sum of its parts.  But some of those parts are magnificent.  First, there is the respectful homage to actors of a prior generation.  Dick Van Dyke, who played Bert the Chimney Sweep in the original \"Mary Poppins\" (1964), returns in this film, even singing and dancing in a final scene, no small accomplishment at age 93.  Karen Dotrice, the original Jane, has a brief cameo.  Angela Lansbury, also 93, who had no association with the original film, is amazingly spry in her brief appearance as a strong-voiced Balloon Lady.\n\nEmily Blunt, who showed off her musical theater chops as the Baker's Wife in \"Into the Woods\" (2014), is luminous as Mary - the perfect blend of regal bearing, mischievousness and warmth.  When Mary Poppins is in charge, this film is on strong footing.  On the other hand, when Lin Manuel-Miranda (Jack the Lamplighter) is on the screen, the audience does not \"look around at how lucky we are to be alive right now.\"  His efforts need considerably more work, work.\n\nDirector Rob Marshall previously has been quite effective in bringing Broadway musicals to the screen.  \"Chicago\" won six Academy Awards in 2003, including Best Picture, the first musical since 1968 to win the top award.  His versions of \"Nine\" (2009) and 2014's \"Into the Woods\" also are worthy of note.\n\nHere, Marshall receives another credit as one of three story writers.  One wonders why, since the plot is almost incidental.  Widower Michael Banks (Ben Whishaw, so excellent in Amazon Prime's \"A Very English Scandal\" this year) has fallen on hard times.  He and his family are about to be evicted from their ancestral home.  If only the family can find their Certificate of Shares in the bank that holds their mortgage, all will be saved.  Six-year-olds across the world have a clear sense of how this will all end.  The show lurches happily along from one song opportunity to the next, sometimes with no plot development.  One interesting quirk:  this may be the only Disney film in history where the animated sequences are by far the least effective elements of the film.\n\nThe score by Marc Shaiman, with lyrics by Shaiman and Scott Wittman, the team behind the excellent \"Hairspray\" (2007), is entirely serviceable.  However, it suffers in comparison to the score of the original film.  The original \"Mary Poppins\" offered a series of songs known by generations - \"A Spoonful of Sugar,\" \"Chim Chim Cheree\" and \"Let's Go Fly a Kite.\" In this film, the score is super-cali-fragil-never-mind.  There are no soaring ballads here that you simply can't get out of your head.  In fact, given the non-existent plot, many seem entirely interchangeable.\n\nIf you need a diversion to minimize the time you have to spend during the holidays talking with family members you've avoided all year, this may be the show for you.  Medical warning:  do not take a spoonful of you-know-what before viewing.  It would just be redundant.",

            "content": "Mary Poppins Returns Review: For this review I thought I\u2019d do a something special and have a combined review with a musical genius, aspiring actor, and my best friend, Landen. Throughout his review I will put breaks through his paragraph and put some of my comments and add-ons in. Mary Poppins Returns was the standout movie musical of the year of the past couple years. I definitely agree, though La La Land is the best musical of recent and my favorite. Every year around this time there is always a musical and I\u2019m always excited to see what it is. Last years was The Greatest Showman, which though it worked as a musical failed as a story for me. Disney hasn\u2019t had a real musical since the underrated Into the Woods. It sounds odd, but for being a sequel to a classic Disney film, it\u2019s originality shined through. Yes. I was expecting there to be many similarities and just repeating the original but it brought a new magic to it. As we can all imagine it can be tough to live up to such a performer as Julie Andrews, but I believe Emily Blunt did it justice. Bringing the same sassy attitude and whimsical charm as Julie Andrews did, Emily Blunt managed to be Mary Poppins but bring her own twists and choices. They couldn\u2019t have picked a better choice for Mary Poppins. Blunt did such a great job and did honor to Julie Andrews Oscar winning performance. I\u2019m sure Julie Andrews agrees. Though nothing can beat Andrews, Emily Blunt did such a great performance landing a Golden Globe nomination (it\u2019s between her and Olivia Coleman for The Favourite, I think Coleman will win however) and possibly an Oscar nomination. Lin Manuel Miranda did a good job of being the character as well. His acting was spotty as well as his singing but I think he did an okay job of keeping up with the other performers. Lin was fine. I personally don\u2019t like his singing that much or his acting. He didn\u2019t do horrible though. He got a Golden Globe nomination in the Comedy/Musical section, which seems to be easy to get into (Amy Schumer was nominated in that category for Trainwreck, definitely not an Oscar worthy performance) The other characters, such as The Banks Family, were great. Emily Mortimer and Ben Whishaw as Jane and Michael did a nice job of not straying from the characters while also portraying the grown up versions. I loved both of them. Emily Mortimer does the best performance that I\u2019ve seen from her. She\u2019s also just a great voice actress (she was Sophie in the amazing Japanese film Howl\u2019s Moving Castle). I absolutely loved Ben Whishaw as Michael. There was so much emotion and depth put into the character. Other than Emily Blunt he was the best part. Both of them were amazing. The kids were great, as most Disney kids are. I liked the children, not as much as I thought I would but I still liked them. I wanted to feel for them just a little but more. The appearances of bigger household name stars were great as well. Julie Walters, funny, Meryl Streep, crazy and entertaining, Colin Firth, evil and good at it. Meryl Streep was just amazing again for how little she was in the movie. Julie Walters is just hilarious all the time and she had some of the best lines in the movie. I really liked Colin Firth\u2019s characters. Lastly, the original songs by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman are really what made this movie shine! They created new songs that were fun and entertaining, yet sad and sentimental. They were amazing original songs but they also went back to the original we know and love, with hidden tunes in the underscore. There\u2019s no doubt that Marc Shaiman will win both the Golden Globe and Oscar for Best Original Score. It was so colorful and beautiful. He brought back some of the original tunes we love and know and it just put a smile on my face. His songs were really good. Surprisingly none were nominated for Golden Globes. If any are nominated for the Oscars it\u2019ll probably either be The Place Where Lost Things Go (beautiful song) or Trip a Little Light Fantastic (the showstopper but not my favorite song). He deserves the awards. Overall, a great film for the entire family, all ages! I\u2019m going to add a few things more now. The choreography was really good, especially for Trip a Little Light Fantastic. My only problem was that they kept focusing on Lin Manuel Miranda and not really anyone else. I understand he\u2019s one of the leads but we only saw one other guy other than him. Speaking of cameras, the cinematography was good. It was colorful at the magical parts and captured the dull and dreary gray of London. As you\u2019ve seen from the trailer and images, they incorporate the old animation in the movie. That was one of my favorite sequences in a movie of recent. I just had a smile the whole time. People have forgotten about that animation since they stopped making animated movies like that recently. The CGI wasn\u2019t the greatest but I felt like it was supposed to be like that because it\u2019s not supposed to feel really real. It might get a nomination for Best Visual Effects but won\u2019t win. I loved this movie and the nostalgia it brought. The sequence for Nowhere to Go But Up (my favorite song) was the best part. It was so nostalgic and beautiful I just wanted to cry. The film was good with the tones from joyful to melancholy. My only complaints for the movie are Lin Manuel Miranda, the emotional attachment to the children could\u2019ve been a little better, and also it was a bit long (2 hrs 10 min) but it\u2019s worth every second. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and it\u2019s one of my favorite of the year! Landen\u2019s Grade: A My Grade: A",

I\u2019m not sure who could possibly experience the sweet story, those amazing lyrics, melodies and absolutely wonderful orchestrations and poo poo all of it. The story although seemingly very basic, has all of the intricate qualities that allow a musical to speak on many levels to many, young and old. It is smartly written, and brilliantly performed. Emily Blunt blew it out of the water with an amazing performance! And all of the supporting actors were spot on. The wide open slot for Julie Andrews was a huge missed opportunity. I think she may realize that if she hasn\u2019t already. It would\u2019ve been a wonderful way to cement and solidify both of those motion pictures together. And quite frankly, she has allowed herself to be used in movies that don\u2019t rise to the heels of this movie. It could\u2019ve been a wonderful legacy piece and a wonderful memorial for the older crowd, and an invitation to the younger crowd to experience what they haven\u2019t seen. Time will tell, but I feel that this is a giant miss for the critics and the crowd that have panned it so quickly and quite frankly, so ravenously.

I went into the movie not knowing what to expect and I came away wishing I would have let it go to DVD. I wanted to like the movie but I just couldn\u2019t. It\u2019s so freaking boring the entire time the musical numbers are forgettable and honestly just pretty bad. I had 0 interest in every character but Mary poppins and to be honest I thought her character was a bit weak too. The only saving grace is Emily blunt because she works her ass off and she does a fantastic job but the story was too bad for her acting to overcome. The funniest part about the whole thing is she isn\u2019t an essential part in the entire film. Theirs no point of her being their. The entire movie could have played out without her and been identical with the outcome... save your money and Redbox it. ",

In a time where Disney remakes reign supreme, Mary Poppins Returns is a breath of fresh air that quickly turns stale, as this \u201csequel\u201d is a remake with a flashy coat of paint. The plot follows the same sequence of events as the original. The film begins showing Jack (this films Burt) singing a song about London. A disliked activity is made fun to introduce Mary\u2019s magic to the children. Mary takes Jack and the kids into an animated world, where hi jinx, a musical number, and a race (chase) ensue. Mary then takes the gang to a magical relative who\u2019s affliction has placed them on the ceiling. Mary then takes the kids to the bank, where their actions put their fathers job in jeopardy. On their way home, they all run into Jack and his gang of chimney sweeps, sorry, lamp lighters, where they all do a musical number using their tools of trade. The children\u2019s father has a change of heart in the end, everything turns out alright and the family celebrates by flying balloons. Mary flies off into the sunset and the movie ends. This isn\u2019t to say that the movie doesn\u2019t bring anything new to the table. The film has a climax unlike the original, where the entire cast attempts to save the Banks\u2019 house. And of course, we can\u2019t ignore all the new music, which is enjoyable and upholds the tone of the original. And all the new scenes are enjoyable, if predictable once you realize it\u2019s following the plot of the original. ",

It may contain songs that don't carry the magic of the original, but still the whole joy and excitement they cause is the same. Emily Blunt is the perfect Mary Poppins. By no means does she try to mimic Julie Andrews playing Mary Poppins. She just got the character so well, she really became Poppins. Jack is no Bert, but Lin-Manuel Miranda does a fantastic job in shaping this new character. Ben Wishaw is acting the hell out of Michael Banks, he is phenomenal. It such a sweet, beautiful movie, a really fun musical and although it is its own thing it feels so nostalgic. It doesn't necessarily rely on nostalgia to succeed, but when it hits you with those feels,it really does. Very wonderful little cameos have broken my heart. \"Mary Poppins Returns\" is pure fun!",

It walks the fine line of referencing the original film while bringing in more of the feel of the novels. The costumes are colorful and wonderfully creative, particularly in the fantasy scenes.  In their recent live action remakes, Disney has assembled top notch talent in costuming and art direction. We all left smiling and feeling hopeful.",

            "content": "Mary Poppins Returns\n2018\nU\ndirected by: Rob Marshall\nstarring:Emily Blunt,Lin Manuel Miranda,Meryl streep,Colin Firth,Dick Van Dyke,Emily Mortimer and Ben Whishaw etc\n\noverall rating 81/100\n\nLets dive in to what makes Mary poppins returns a truly amazing in most ways sequel and another strong edition to the disney brand.\n\nLets start off with the incredible cast. Despite everyone having there excellent qualities i am particularly highlighting Julie Walters and Lin Manuel Miranda. Firstly Julie Walters is a fantastic actress and always does well in these types of roles as seen in Harry Potter and Paddington. She brought some humour to the film which helped the scenes with her in feel more humorous and warm. And secondly to Lin Manuel Miranda who did a fantastic job at technically playing Bert 2.0. He had the charm,the accent and great musical numbers to his character. You couldn\u00e2(TM)t help but smile whenever he appeared on screen i think having a career in the west end has helped him tremendously for this type of role.\n\nNext i do have to congratulate the director for getting the perfect actress for the role of Mary poppins. Emily Blunt was a fantastic Mary poppins. she has the charm the wittiness and the warmth that Julie Andrews bought. And even added a flavour of sass to the iconic character so she was on par and in some elements better then Julie Andrews.\n\nThe only slightly negative thing to do with the cast was the part of Meryl Streep. Her character just felt very out of place in the film and the whole scene with her in could of been cut from the film but it was fine for what it was.\n\nNext I would like to add that the plot had so many nods to the original it was very nice to see after such a long wait for the sequel. Having key phrases and objects and the 2D animation world really will satisfy any fans of the original. And extending on the 2D animation world i thought that this whole scene was actually executed better then the original with the penguins and everything recognisable in the scene. It was just so nice to see this still added and done in the same way as the original but it will obviously look better due to higher budget.The director really did a creative and visually good job with making this as charming to watch as the original. \n\nNext i would like to add the excellent musical numbers in this film. Yes perhaps there aren\u00e2(TM)t as many iconic songs in this film as the original. But all the numbers were still very pleasant to watch and really took you to another place when listening. And all the cast could sing very well which also made the scenes even better.\n\nThe final nice positive that i think that Disney has really been executing well recently is the emotional depth to the narrative. having the Banks children recently losing there mum and to see how badly there father Michael Banks ( Ben Whishaw) was coping and that he didn\u00e2(TM)t know how to cope with looking after the children really added some heartwarming scenes into the film and to see them all gradually get closer was very sweet indeed.\n\nJust ending on 2 only little things negative to say. Firstly i did question a couple of times whether the director was perhaps being to reliant on the original in certain scenes. Which i think they were in places but that i think was the directors creative choice so it was still very nostalgic to see and there was just enough new elements to the film to balance it out. And finally The actual plot of the Banks home was fairly dull just in places but not so dull as to make the film that much worse but i do think if there was more focus on this type of plot my rating would of been a bit lower.\n\nOverall Mary poppins returns is a fantastic film which is on the same level as the original and is another very strong addition to the Disney cannon.",

I was initially unimpressed by the idea of retreading such an iconic classic, but after hearing Emily Blunt on Fresh Air and reading the New Yorker review, I found myself actually excited to see it.\n\nWhy in the world is this movie getting such lukewarm praise?!\nIt is a sure-footed, beautifully wrought visit back to the era when children\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)s entertainment wasn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)t trying to be \u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2edgy\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2\u00ef\u00bf 1/2?, wasn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)t concerned with feeling topical or making meta-references to popular culture, and when the studio understood that if you make something truly marvelous on its own terms, it will entertain the audience at all ages.\n\nThe songs are absolutely first-rate, and criticisms of the music or the beats of the film as being somehow derivative are nonsense. If this had been made in some significantly different style, audiences (and presumably the haughty critics) would have cried foul. Mary Poppins Returns is the perfect example of a movie that has to be \u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2just the same, but different\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2\u00ef\u00bf 1/2?. Where a movie like \u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2The Force Awakens\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2\u00ef\u00bf 1/2? made me feel hollowed out inside, reminded that I will never be 8 years old again, \u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2Mary Poppins Returns\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2\u00ef\u00bf 1/2? made me feel like something had been restored within me. How sad that so many others have apparently gone into this movie prepared to dismiss it, and therefore well armored against the intrusion of a feeling. Apparently, guileless enjoyment is terminally out of fashion for some people; they are the poorer for it.",

Up to the hour and a half point--no pun intended--he is the only bright light.\n\nJulie Walker, as the housekeeper, is almost an afterthought while Colin Firth should have been given a mustache to twirl as the villain to do something with the role. As the Banks children Pixie Davies, Nathanael Saleh and Joel Dawson they are given little more than they are expected to while Emily Mortimer, as their aunt, lights up the screen here and there and Ben Whishaw, as their father, really is wooden up to and in the last half hour of the film when he really comes through in a moving scene. Oh, yes, the less said about Meryl Streep, her song and her time on the screen the better.\n\nThe last half hour in no way makes up for the first 90-95 minutes but the screen does come alive with a song and dance by 93 year-old Dick Van Dyke up on a desk, with movie magic or not, reprising \"Tripping The Light Fantastic\" done earlier in the film by Miranda, along with 93 year-old Angela Lansbury as the Balloon Lady singing one of the better songs from the movie, \"Nowhere To Go but Up\" starting a full cast number.\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda always talks about watching the old song and dance movies and in \"Mary Poppins Returns\" he has two numbers, the first being \"Tripping The Light Fantastic\" and the second, \"Race To Big Ben\", that fulfill any dreams he might have had and brings back the magic of \"Mary Poppins\".\n\n\"Mary Poppins Returns\" offers 30 minutes of entertainment in a film that is 130 minutes long and can probably watch Lin-Manuel Miranda, Dick Van Dyke and Angela Lansbury in their show shopping numbers on youtube!",

But what I have seen is that many people are picking on her because she \"Wasn't as good as Julie Andrews\". She's not Julie Andrews, therefore she couldn't be the exact same woman from 1964. She said herself she didn't try to act like Julie Andrews, because she could never compare to her. She instead tried to impersonate the nanny from the book, and did a fine job of it.\nI'm going to tell you to see this movie. It's spectacular, plus it stars Lin-Manuel Miranda, Meryl Streep, and Dick Van Dyke.",

The song and dance numbers look and sound fine, with orchestrations shimmering and glittering. If the melodies and lyrics are nowhere near as accomplished and memorable as those of the Sherman Brothers, well, you can't expect miracles. (Bizarrely, my wife and I still came out humming numbers from the original!) More seriously damaging is the portrayal of Poppins. Emily Blunt cannot balance strictness with kindness in her characterisation. Her performance seemed to me calculating and cold, and at times painful to watch. I was left wondering how much better Emily Mortimer might have played the lead instead. (She really shines as Jane.) This is a shame, as so much of the production does work beautifully, including the entire rest of the casting. Miranda is superb. Whishaw and Firth are as reliable as you'd expect, and the three children are also excellent. The animated sequences are pretty well done (a decent homage to former glories), and the overall story arc works well. The final 15 minutes are a particular delight, mainly for the show-stopping cameos by Dick Van Dyke and Angela Lansbury. (Van Dyke particularly had me reaching for my hanky.) But I have to deduct 1  1/2  stars for Blunt, and  1/2  star for the overly fussy, contrived lyrics. My wife, it's true, loved the movie unconditionally, whilst still acknowledging Blunt's miscasting, and so did our 6 year old daughter (whose favourite scene was bathtime.)  All in all, a fair and respectful sequel to an all-time classic, one which has made us all want to watch the original movie again.",

Lin-Manuel Miranda's Jack was so insignificant to the movie and even at some parts just sort of appeared. If you took him out of the movie very little plot will change. Emily Blunt was a fine Mary Poppins. Not great, not terrific just sort of fine.

            "content": "I walked into the theater with every intention of hating Mary Poppins Returns. As the movie started I began thinking of each little flaw I could nitpick. That sounds mean-spirited and harsh, but as an avid fan who grew up watching the original Mary Poppins, it felt disrespectful and ridiculous that someone thought they could create a legitimate sequel to such an iconic film 54 years later. Then, as I was sitting there gritting my teeth and ready to write the most scathing review I could muster, I heard someone humming along to the music. Wait, was that me?!? I realized I was grinning from ear to ear despite myself. There is a magic in Mary Poppins Returns that hooked me against my better judgement. It is a charming film that has a style that harkens back to the original, to the point that I almost have to admit this is a legitimate sequel. With each new scene I was more engrossed and feeling like a kid again. My brain shut off its critical nagging, and I was having a great time, waiting for the movie to end so I could buy the soundtrack right away. Now there\u2019s a reason that Mary Poppins Returns feels so reminiscent of the original, and that is the fact that it is almost a remake. The plot has most of the same beats, and every single song can be directly linked to the one it is emulating from the original. It\u2019s a great formula, so that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, and perhaps the fact that it kept reminding me of something I love played into my enjoyment. It\u2019s very similar, but rest assured it is inferior in every way when you compare the two. Emily Blunt is fine, but she\u2019s no Julie Andrews. The songs are playful and fun, but they\u2019re not as strong as the Sherman Brothers\u2019 masterpiece. The plot here is weak, and threatens to become boring, but it never quite got there for me. If you like the original Mary Poppins, and you\u2019re able to watch Returns without comparing them directly with one another, you should find something to enjoy in this sequel. It was well-made by people who clearly had some reverence for what Walt Disney and his team did half a century ago.",

I now see it can be used for Good as well as for Evil. And toward the fairytale happy ending I was lazily under its spell but I shot upright in my seat with (especially), its first Surprise. (There is a second one). At the first one I thought - is it? No, it can't be, can it? Am I imagining it? But it was!  My rule is never to give a film 5 stars. So I don't give it 5 stars. I have to give it - on this one and only occasion - six stars! Some of the recent Disney's efforts have been poor. They got this one right!",

It only uses hints of the original songs and exercises great restraint. Blunt never felt like she was trying to be Andrews playing Poppins. This movie takes inspiration from the books and handles some harder lessons like how to cope with loss. Disney has carved a niche for itself with legacy and loss as themes in recent movies like Black Panther, Infinity War, Cars 3, Coco, Thor Ragnarok, and so on. The songs are very catchy and I feel will age well and are only being attacked because they are being compared to some of the best songs in Disney\u2019s history. This movie shines because it is a combination of classic Disney sensibilities and their modern ones. ",

Parents, grand parents, kids and couples alike!  I Strongly disagree in the NYT review as usual; the movie is well done, from music to characters to acting and direction.  Maybe 1 number too long, maybe other small flaws, but I give MPR much credit for repeating the original without remaking it .. it's not a replacement but an compatible addition.  Blunt is outstanding.  The musical style is (way)more like the original than modern Broadway... a daring and appreciated tactic.  Good show all around!",

One of the problems with sequels this far apart is that they often lose the heart and soul of the original movie franchise. Not so in this case. Disney stays true to Travers' tale as well as true to the style of the original and somehow far beyond his grave a hint of Walt is contained within. Emily Blunt is not just a good Mary Poppins, she IS Mary Poppins in every sense. From her accent to her singing, to her clever wit and quick quips, the performance is spot on to the point of Oscar worthiness. Disney reminisces all the wonder and imagination of the original with new spins on live action mixed with animation, managing to include both new and old into a solid 2 hours of fun, singing, dancing, laughing, emotion, and pure entertainment. Do the kid in you a favor. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!",

Admittedly, this was partly for the reason both of us wanted to see this fifty-four-year-later sequel to Mary Poppins and didn't want to have to go through the hassle of finding a babysitter the weekend before Christmas, but it was mostly due to the fact that despite the lack of interest in the promotional materials that sometimes you just have to trust your parents know better than you and, lucky for us, our little four-year-old girl decided to indulge us on this particular matter (the slush and popcorn might have factored in, but I digress). The point being, that once director Rob Marshall's (Chicago, Into the Woods) Mary Poppins Returns began and Emily Blunt's incarnation of the practically perfect nanny showed up and began teaching the new generation of Banks children (as well as reminding their parents) that while imagination may not always be approved of, that it's more than necessary to make life fun and largely bearable, the little one was more than hooked by the magic of the titular character. And so, while Mary Poppins Returns is admittedly more of a re-hash or re-imagining of that first, 1964 film than I would have either thought or hoped it to be it is also a reminder of how powerful and delightful the imagination can truly be. Though my personal experience with the film may not be as heartening as those who take their teenagers to the theater and see their faces revert to a state of child-like wonder; to experience the kind of magic and possibilities Mary Poppins brings to the table and exerts with pure enthusiasm strike our daughter in such a clear and distinct way-especially during the numerous musical numbers-was quite something. The Julie Andrews picture was one of those movies that was always on whenever I needed it to be growing up and taking on the burden of crafting a follow-up to that respected classic (the only live-action film Disney saw garner a Best Picture nod in his day) is worth a degree of built-in respect for even attempting as much and while Mary Poppins Returns could have certainly done a little more to stand on its own it is so excessively charming, appropriately cute, and full of original songs and creative executions that it's hard to argue the film is anything but perfectly pleasant in every way.\n\nread the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com",

His opening number \"Underneath the lovely London sky\" was just beautiful and set the tone even if his accent was rubbish cockney like Van Dyke's original. I just thought that was another wink and a nod. Many of the musical numbers are fantastic and me and the children really liked the bawdy vaudeville number, \" the cover is not the book\" and \"trip a little light fantastic\", and Michael's \"conversation\". I didnt really like \"turning turtle\". Although there is a lot of magic, the plot seemed very contrived ( or conjured?) in places such as with Big Ben and the final scene at the bank, although Van Dyke always puts a smile on my face. We left the theater feeling cheery and yet a bit confuddled. Anyway, will still recommend to my friends.",

The kids will love this movie, but the original is better.  Blunt was great as Poppins, but Miranda's dance scenes were not even close to what Van Dyke did in the original.  Disney should've hired someone that can dance for Jack's part.  The \"bowl\" scene was probably the best part of the movie, but we didn't need the Meryl Streep scene. It looked like it was forced, and didn't belong in the film.  If it was deleted, then we'd have had a better movie.",

Emily Blunt is an extremely talented actress, and now we know she can sing too! We knew Lin-Manuel Miranda could do both, and he did them well. The other characters were very talented as well, and they all contribute to the magical feeling this movies gives off. The graphics and CGI are probably the most amazing part of it all. I knew technology has gone a long way, but the the mixing of different types of animation and reality made the movie feel that much more magical and whimsical. In Mary Poppins, it's clear that each actor or actress was meant to play the role they played. The two hour movie flew by in what felt like minutes. The only reason I gave this movie 4.5 stars and not 5 is because  sometimes it just felt like so much was coming at me at one time, and I got a little lost. But that was only at some points, and the majority of the movie was beautifully done. Mary Poppins has never been a favorite of mine, but this rendition was very well done.",

Some say she lacks a bit of the warmth of Andrews but as a slightly older Poppins that works very well. She makes Mary her own and creates a fun character flaw, her enormous (yet deserved) ego. Lin Manuel was fine as Jack, the Bert replacement, an allegedly young chimney sweep during first film who grew up. The kids were solid particularly Georgie. The special effects made Aquaman laughable in comparison. Bad: Songs were not memorable. Too many cameos. Van Dyke was the best but he should have returned as Bert. Ugly: Story was a mess. Michael Banks was awful. The actor brought no life to the role and his character made no sense. He was an artist who had no art supplies in house and never painted. His only song was the last song. He was a totally wasted character and the heavy death of a mother we never met at all lacks heft in film. We needed to see a glimpse of her at the beginning to feel the loss. This was way too much of a retread of the original and it is an absolute shame because the bewitching Blunt could have accomplished Disney\u2019s mission and turned this into a franchise. The cast needed more diversity and the story of a rich white man who felt he was no longer wealthy enough to pay his bills lacks appeal to many working class families who attend the movies. Bad story. Absolute shame. Sharper screenplay and lyrics could have made this a classic since Blunt clearly brought an A game. ",

Oh, Meryl Streep has the best song and is very good as cousin Topsy. She's in it just long enough, but do we ever find out if she fixed that bowl??? I agreed with PL Travers, if it was true that she didn't care for the penguins in the original, but I didn't mind the animation as nostalgia now. Too many pixelated movies now, it's nice to see a \" throw back.\"\nI liked the homage to the original and I got goose \nbumps the minute we arrive at 17 Cherry Tree Lane, and I believe the original Jane passes through for a cameo as \ndoes Dick VanDyke, which was brilliant!! \nIn closing, worth the matinee ticket price!

            "content": "Flies Supremely Without Any Strings.\n\nMary Poppins Returns\n\nMarshall's version of one of the most beloved Disney character is practically advanced and not your usual overprotective confidant. Unlike the previous version, this one is less focused on glorifying Blunt's stardom by putting all the work in her shoulder and instead works marvelously as a teamwork. It surely is a Disney feature from head to toe. First of all, as usual Marshall's visual galore offers you an overwhelming dose of cinema with its meticulous art designing and jaw dropping production design. From choreography to performance, he squeezes out the best from each frame. The visual effects are a bit dodgy, but the animated musical sequence is a pure packet of delight. Frankly, if considered only the musical acts, it is a perfect ten.\n\nFrom catchy songs to amazing choreography, the film flows smoothly without overstaying its welcome. Among many many musical bits, the one concerning the lanterns at night with Miranda at the helm is the perfect collaboration of everything; song, performance, choreography and visuals. And as far as the rest of the storytelling is concerned, unlike his few previous projects, Marshall has managed to keep it pragmatic. With fluent vocab and a persistent theme of staging each character as the protagonist of the scene, it is palpable to its happy-go-lucky nature.\n\nThe writing is quite balanced, all the actors gets their stand out moments. Whishaw as the victim has an amazing voice and sings expressively with Mortimer who might not have enough to invest but has tightly hold on to her role. The younger cast draws attention from the elder ones in musical sequences especially in the lantern musical act. Streep and Firth are merely their to raise the stakes of the table, their part concerns as an introduction to hold the audience whenever the storyline drops down.\n\nSurprisingly, Miranda has a much bigger part to play, almost walking parallel-y to Blunt as a lead, his performance may be put on stand on drama for questioning but on musical acts, he is put upfront by the makers knowingly that he will impress. Blunt under the sheer pressure of filling in the shoes of Andrews, is confident and equally hilarious. One of the best gags of all is devouring her perfect-ness in the mirror that itself grows as a character. Marshall's maturity can be pointed out in here, where he doesn't unnecessarily offers Blunt a wider range to please the viewers, in her own contract-orial margin, she delivers unflinchingly. There is a sense of Disney-ness that saves this before falling into mediocrity lane.\n\nThe culminated sub-plots and tactics projected that hits altogether in the last act, amps up our emotions where Marshall manages to craft a live action sequence that is arguably written for an animated one. This merrily merry place does get way too sweet at times for you to swallow. And for their conflict, the very essence of Mary Poppins is it, and hence with an ironic and sarcastic note carried off effervescently by Blunt, it somehow manages to land safely; so what if with an umbrella. Mary Poppins Returns; she does, and she makes sure it matches the expectations, if not exceeds.",

Mary Poppins Returns to restore the childhood innocence of the younger children that have gone through turmoil. Emily Blunt and Lin-Manuel give truly outstanding musical performances. If you listen to the lyrics of the songs they tie into the story. The reprise of \"Nothings Gone Forever\" (sung by the kids) helps Michael Banks learn the all is right around you. Dick Van Dyke gives the must anticipated punch line that references and ties in the original. I strongly recommend this. As a side note: the music gives an homage  with similar vibe while giving additional musical notes like a cabaret with moments of rap (A Book Is Not The Cover & The Royal Doulton Music Hall).",

            "content": "I have no real investment in Mary Poppins as a character or the original 1964 movie, so I was expecting to walk out of Mary Poppins Returns with a shrug, likely finding it middling at worse. I was unprepared for what I endured, and endured is the accurate statement. Mary Poppins Returns is an insane movie and one of the most maddening and painful experiences in a theater I've had all year, and no number of spoonfuls of sugar will help this bad medicine go far enough down.\n\nIt's the \"Great Slump,\" a.k.a. Depression, in London and the Banks children have grown up. Michael (Ben Whishaw) has three young children of his own and he's struggling to maintain his job at the bank and be the father they need in the wake of his wife's death. His sister, Jane (Emily Mortimer), has moved into help but it's still not enough. Enter that famous nanny, Mary Poppins (Emily Blunt), who takes it upon herself to watch over the children, help them through the grieving process, and explore the outer reaches of London with some help from some friends, chiefly Jack (Lin Manuel-Miranda). The Banks family is in danger of losing their home to the head of the bank (Colin Firth) unless they can find a specific title of shares that will grant them a wealth denied their adult lives.\n\nThis movie felt like it was eight hours long and I had no sense of how much time was passing, mostly because of its misshaped structure and general lack of pacing. Mary Poppins Returns feels like it could have been renamed The Tony Awards: The Movie. It's one unrelated song-and-dance number after another, rarely building from the previous one, and so it feels like an eternal televised awards show that just shuffles from one set piece to the next, never providing a sense of direction or finality. Things just happen in this movie and then different things happen but rarely do they feel consequential. This makes the film feel endless because you have no real concept of progression. It's just another unrelated song into an unrelated magical realm that doesn't really seem like it matters, and then we're off to the next. I think some part of me is still trapped watching Mary Poppins Returns, never allowed to leave.\n\nThis would be mitigated if the songs were any good. There are over a dozen and not a single one is memorable. It was mere minutes after leaving the theater that I pressed myself into trying to hum any one of them, and I could not. They instantly vanish from your memory because there are no melodies or interesting production aspects that cause them to stand out. They assault you with their blandness and staid orchestration. They're a careful recreation of an older sounding, 1950s musical, an antiquated sound that doesn't have the same traction today. The only way you can remember one of these songs is if you have a traumatic experience forever linked to one of these mediocre, warbling collection of sounds.\n\nThere are two astoundingly peculiar songs. \"Trip a Little Light Fantastic\" is a big ensemble number involving the lamp lighters lead by Miranda. However, the song reference is clearly evocative of the Timothy Leary \"trip the light fantastic\" comment about LSD. It's strange to think this is only a coincidence when the lamp lighters are dubbed \"learies.\" It's not a good song to begin with and the performance literally involves men on BMX bicycles flying around and doing tricks. How is any of this happening in a reported Disney family film? The Meryl Streep \"Turning Turtle\" song may be the most excruciating five minutes I've sat through for all 2018. It's just embarrassing to watch and made me honestly think of the children's movie disaster, The Ooogieloves, where you watch once proud actors debase themselves and their legacies in depressing fashion. That's the level of dread and mourning I had watching Streep slog through a Bela Lugosi accent and dance upside down. It has to be seen to be believed but you shouldn't ever have to see this. I have a new appreciation for the La La Land songs.\n\nThe continual removal of stakes robs the movie of feeling like anything onscreen genuinely matters. Mary Poppins is a magical creature without clearly defined rules or limits. At any point she might simply have the solution to a problem that she wasn't sharing. Take for instance the ending (spoilers for the duration of this paragraph, but really, who cares?) where the lamp lighters and the Banks family race to ole Big Ben to literally \"turn back time\" by adjusting the clock hands. The lamp lighters use their ladders to free climb the face of the clock to the very top, only to be undone by not being able to reach the minute hand at it nears twelve. Then all of a sudden Mary Poppins scoffs to herself and flies up to the clock face to adjust it. If she could do this the whole time why did these very mortal men risk their lives in this exercise? I think Mary Poppins may be a cruel god (more on this later). The concluding dash to ensure the Banks family can keep their home involves not one, not two, but three deus ex machinas, a \"Turducken of ex machinas\" as my pal Ben Bailey termed it. Ultimately all of their actions do not even matter because the film routinely provides an unknown escape route that invalidates their efforts. It turns out, in the end, they weren't even going to lose their home thanks to (at my best guess) a magical bird head that is best friends with the head of a bank and who never mentioned this before, the same head of the bank who has just been off in what appears to be an adjacent room for whatever reason and that also knows that Michael Banks has accrued a hefty fortune from a childhood investment, and has never mentioned it as well except in this crucial moment. Why, why does Mary Poppins Returns do this? Why does it present stakes or the illusion of stakes only to sabotage them every time?\n\nIs Mary Poppins really a creature of good or does her need to be loved prove her a fickle god who demands adulation, subservience, and obedience? When Mary Poppins travels from world to world, some live action, some animated, all fanciful, every inhabitant seems to know this woman and love her unconditionally despite her prevalent smarm. The bigger question is do these magical worlds exist independent of Mary Poppins? Is there a pocket universe in existence on the side of a chipped porcelain bowl, or did it only come into existence when Mary Poppins decided it would be a lovely vacation spot? If so, that means she is calling into being a throng of adoring creatures that exist to validate her impulsive whims. She is a selfish god that demands an audience of servants and sycophants, not unlike the Javier Bardem character in Darren Aronofsky's polarizing polemic, mother!.\n\nThe actors acquit themselves fine for their roles. Blunt (A Quiet Place) and Miranda (Moana) will still be charming performers even when given substandard material. Blunt holds your attention with her prissy, schoolmarm persona, balancing the audience's memories of Julie Andrews without going into parody. Her singing (as also evidenced from 2014's Into the Woods) is above average and can help make some of the songs more tolerable to listen to. Miranda is a talent bursting with charisma and range, which makes it all the more frustrating to squeeze him into the narrow confines of a cockney scamp. He does get a rapping reprise in \"A Cover is Not the Book\" with a group of cartoon penguins. The stranger element is that it really feels like Miranda's character wants to have sex with Mary Poppins. They slot him as a forced romantic option for Mortimer's underwritten sister, but his eyes are clearly set for the woman who bosses people around and has magic in her fingers. He remembers her when he was a boy chimney sweep and I think he's been fantasizing about her every day since. Plus, she hasn't aged in 30 years.\n\nMary Poppins Returns is a bizarre artifact of a displaced time, taking great pains to recreate a style but without providing a purpose or sense of feeling beyond emulation. I don't know who this movie is for besides the hardcore fans of the original. There are dancing dolphins, talking dogs, bathtub portals, an upside down house, flying balloons, union protests, Angelina Lansbury or an animatronic lookalike, and there's lots of songs you will be unable to recall and a story that repeatedly removes any stakes or grounding from beneath itself so that the movie never feels firm or purposeful. There were several points where I just wanted to throw up my hands and ask, \"What am I watching?\" I still don't know. Mary Poppins Returns is a movie musical that is nothing short of super-cali-fragil-awful.\n\nNate's Grade: D+",

This movie rubbed me the wrong way immediately when Mary Poppins was cold and aloof while being reacquainted with Jane and Michael.  At that moment I realized that this would not be the magical experience I had imagined or expected. I couldnt stand Mary Poppins, instead of being stern and cheerful she spent the first half of the movie being arrogant and snide. \nLin Manuel Miranda was fantastic as Jack. I absolutely enjoyed 4 musical numbers and chuckled out loud once during this entire movie; and that slight chuckle was during the song A Cover is not a book, it\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s an amazing scene. The scene with Meryl Streep is clever and fun, the dancing chimney sweep scene is entertaining and seeing Dick Van Dyke absolutely brought me joy.

The hand drawn animated scenes and characters were amazing, smooth and one of a kind.  Meryl Streep\u00e2(TM)s scene was not necessary, it was side story that would have saved fifteen minutes of screen time off of a movie that ran over two hours long.

I loved her take on the character. She was hilarious! The child actors had more complexity and comedic timing in Returns than the original. I also had my reservations on Lin Manuel Miranda (I low key don\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t like the Hamilton music, sshhh!), but he gave an awesome performance.\n\nI loved all the new songs, too! The score was beautifully written. It had the charming similarity of the original as if it were the same composer expanding on a previous work as one movement tying together seamlessly. (I.e. John Williams in each Star Wars trilogy).\n\nWe rewatched the original the night before so we could have it fresh in our minds. We almost fell asleep in the second half. But that reminds me I usually stopped watching it halfway through as a kid. it kinda gets boring, right?\n\nI feel that in many ways Returns is even a better film. It does not compete with the original as it is a sequel, but it enhances and complements it. Even the very reason she Returns in the first place and the message is, in contrast with the message of the original film, poetic.\n\nSo stop trying to sound smart and say you hated it.

I am sad to report that it was not well received and we all left the film feeling a bit cheated and questioning why Disney would greenlight such a mediocre execution and concept?\n\nDisney has managed to make this movie so incredibly unoriginal following the original Mary Poppins almost to a \"T\" with the only obvious changes being inconsequential (Mom has passed and Dad is an idiotic struggling artist turned bank teller).  The casting is uninspired and as much as we love Emily Blunt, she doesn't make this movie sing.  She's not bad but if Disney is going to do such a vanilla remake then you better get a full cast that can sing their faces off.  Emily does not fit this role.  \n\nEven the amazingly talented Lin Manuel Miranda seems out of place here.  His only capacity in this film is as a performer only and it makes me wonder how much better the movie would have been if he had been allowed to take his brush to this canvas? \n\nBut shame again on Disney for taking the middle-of-the-road approach and releasing a movie that should not have been made.  It runs too long and the true test of a movie like this is my kids who stopped paying attention very early on.  The songs were not good and we just don't really care about the Banks family.  Dad is a dope who is not likable and it's surprising he didn't lose the house years ago.  The effects look like they were done in the 60's and the only stand-out aspect to this movie is some of the costumes and sets.  We wish Disney would have put a bit more effort in to re-releasing this classic instead of just remaking the exact film but only worse.  In essence, we wish Mary had not returned.",

            "content": "Mary Poppins Returns, about the titular nanny returning to help the grown up Banks children, was a true experience for me that brings back the feel of the original Mary Poppins and 60's Disney in general. (It even has a nostalgic old-fashioned opening credits).\n\nThe entire thing looks and feels fantastic like an old-timey storybook. Includes a new 2-D animated/live-action segment, not something we've seen in a while and a welcome comeback. The story itself has a very old-fashioned and genuinely good-hearted feel to it.\n\nGreat cast. Blunt makes and an excellent Mary Poppins, and Lin Manuel Miranda is pretty likable as Jack, Bert's replacement. Ben Wishaw (the voice of Paddinton and the most recent Q from the James Bond films) does a surprisingly sympathetic job as Michael Banks mourning the loss of his wife and just trying to keep things together.\n\nThe songs, by Marc Shaiman (Hairspray and parts of the South Park movie and Team America) aren't as catchy or memorable as the first film, but that's not knocking these songs. I did like them all and they again captured an old-school feeling.\n\nThere were some weak points. A lot of the scenes set in London, were too darkly shot for their own good. I mean I understand that an intentional style choice as the bleakness of London contrasts with the brightness Mary Poppins brings, but it makes it a pain to watch at some points.\n\nThe movie is basically like The Force Awakens as it repeats many elements from the first film. (They even bring back Admiral Boom, now played by David Warner. I mean come on he was no spring chicken in the first film. He should be dead by now.) Also, the whole mother-just-died bit was done by Disney only a month ago for the Nutcracker movie, although this movie handles it a lot better if you ask me.\n\nLastly, the main antagonist is paper-thin and whose crookedness exceeds practicality. This is especially disappointing as the first film didn't need this sort of villain to drive the plot.\n\nThose criticisms aside, I had so much fun with this movie that I'm still giving it a full rating. \n\nThere is nothing really objectionable in this but be forewarned younger children may be bored by the more talky moments. I saw restlessness in my nephew and other young children while watching this.",

            "content": "Mary Poppins Returns has a lot to live up to in the shadow of the 1964 classic, and honestly its gonna need some time until it can be told if it's a success.\n\nThis winter's musical to bring in the masses in a year without a Star Wars, Mary Poppins Returns is just as comparable to last year's The Greatest Showman as it is the Disney original, but definitely a different level of effective.\n\nThis film banks (the pardon the pun) on the nostalgia and classic filmmaking of Mary Poppins for effect. Where we're given the endearing and inaccurate London of the Julie Andrews film once again, full of whimsy and imagination. A lot of the beats are similar and we're given our fare share of references, but none of them are groan-inducing. In fact, it' more sweet and delightful hearing music cues or seeing classic Mary Poppins magic once again. \n\nRob Marshall does well to not oversaturate Mary Poppins Returns with modern special effects. They are certainly used here, but there's a feeling of imperfection and of the first film in its practicality. Sequences are imaginative and capture your memories of Mary Poppins, with only a bit of a modern wipe on it.\n\nMake no mistake, Mary Poppins Returns is still bigger and better thanks to budgets and advancements, but it feels good to watch live action and animation come together again without in your face computer animation.\n\nMarshall is no stranger to putting musicals to film, but much like his track record, it's a bit mixed here. For every beautiful sequence full of wonderful choreography there's sequences of poor musical cinematography and editing that lacks that punch. Mary Poppins Returns has its highlights, but there are sequences that could easily be excised and some parts that could have done with a reshoot and a recut.\n\nMary Poppins Returns is an ambitious love letter, and it's also cursed by its aspirations. It's tough when you try and match a perfect musical soundtrack by some of the greats. Not a slant on the talented Marc Shaiman at all, just highlighting the daunting task of even remotely matching something like  Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.\n\nWhat it undoubtedly gets right is it's cast. It's tough to call what's the smarter call: Lin-Manuel Miranda as the Jack the lamplighter or Emily Blunt as Mary Poppins. Blunt shines in this, channeling her best into it to recreate the iconic nanny with great respect to the legacy. She's not practically perfect in every way, but she's exactly what you need here. Same for Miranda, it's great whenever you see someone enjoying every second of their job, and Miranda's on top of the moon from his very introduction.\n\nOther casting choices go from great to so odd and potentially problematic. Colin Firth is the perfect villain you need, Ben Whishaw and Emily Mortimer rock being the grown up Banks children, but goddamn, why the hell is Meryl Streep in this movie, I still don't know. \n\nMary Poppins Returns is the love letter you didn't know someone wanted to make for Mary Poppins. It's familiar and it's safe and it tries to be a good modern sequel/pastiche. It's fun and it's optimistic and it's bright, which is definitely my shit. For all of its appreciation it suffers for never reaching the highs of Julie Andrews, and that says a lot coming from a returning nanny holding a kite flying over the smog of London.\n\n3/5 Stars.\n\n- CJ",

Emily Blunt was mostly excellent as Mary Poppins but was always going to be shadowed by Julie Andrews. However what really was her only negative part of the performance If to be picky was the awful switch of accent from 1920s nanny to almost little Mo from EastEnders was cringe worthy.\n\nAll in all this is an excellent film and really has songs you can sing to.\n\nFurthermore how great to see Dick Van Dyke back on screen!",

Where the original has a handful of songs even watching once were so catchy and original that people sing them to this day. My seven year old heard a spoon full of sugar way before she ever saw the orininal. I did not get that from any of the songs from this movie. Good movie and portrayal as long as you forget the overload of bad musical numbers. Just my take. ",

From that point on the movie fully had my heart and I found myself completely enraptured by it. \n\nRob Marshall has given us a delightful cotton candy bouquet of a movie that throws away any notion of cynicism and just embraces the joyous spirit of the film's message. And while the songs ultimately can't hold a candle to those from the original film, Marshall's staging of them make up those shortcomings by putting pure magic on screen that is impossible not to smile at. \n\nAlso: Dick Van Dyke and Angela Lansbury showing up toward the end was too much for my gay heart to take. I just want to eat some cake and watch it all over again.",

The soundtrack doesn't meet the first movie standards and it truly pains me to say this, but so many songs still made me laugh out loud or broke my heart. A predictable ending but since it is a movie based on a kid book, I can't really argue and is it just me or is Colin Firth always a banker?\nNonetheless, the minutes passed by without me even acknowledging them, my heart way too much pleased with this classic's sequel that made me leave the theater, my eyes red from crying too much and a smile that didn't left my face while I listened to the soundtrack again and again.",

Stranger Things uses our love of the 80s to build an effective backdrop for the show. Superman Returns leaned so hard on Richard Donner\u2019s films that they lifted the plot of the first film. Nostalgia can be a tricky thing. I\u2019ve been thinking about this since we took Julianne and a friend to see Mary Poppins Returns. I\u2019ll admit, I really liked it. I found Emily Blunt utterly charming as Mary. She\u2019s a fantastic actress. Lin-Manuel Miranda was well cast as Jack the Lamp-Lighter. The music dazzles (A Cover is Not the Book was my favorite) and the dance numbers are fantastic (Trip a Little Light Fantastic has a wonderful dance number). There are nostalgic moments but you could have zero knowledge of Mary Poppins and be able to follow the story. It can be a little predictable at times if you pay attention. There\u2019s at least one song and dance number I didn\u2019t particularly care for when Meryl Streep\u2019s Topsy shows up. As for the two big nostalgic moments: there are two cameos in the film. Dick Van Dyke shows up to do a little dance. Which for a guy in his 90s is pretty amazing. There\u2019s another cameo that unfortunately is not Julie Andrews. I\u2019m certain the part was offered to her, but she turned it down. Her reasoning was sweet. She didn\u2019t want to distract from Emily Blunt\u2019s performance. However, it\u2019s still a special performance and, from the moment you hear the voice, you\u2019ll know exactly who it is. Overall, Mary Poppins Returns feels like a throwback to the films of yesteryear. The viewer can clearly feel the love and care that went into being Mary back. ",

            "content": "First of all, Emily Blunt's performance as Mary Poppins is excellent. She makes this famous character her own by just embodying her. She seems more like somebody who actually cares about these children. The ending shows this the best. Also in the song \"Where the Lost Things Go\" they show her caring for the children a way that the original didn't show. I also have to applaud Lin-Manuel Miranda, who played Jack, performance in this film. You could easily tell that he was having fun with his character. I just wished we got to see his character more. I'm glad that they didn't change the special effects in this film and kept it in the style of the 1964 one. They did put a slight modern day look to it but it was still the same style at the end of the day. Now some people say that none of the songs in this aren't catchy and I argue over that. I would say that all but a few songs are catchy. The only non-catchy songs are the ones that are a bit slower and \"Turning Turtle.\" All the other songs are energetic and have great choreography to go with them. Marc Shaiman also composed the original score for this film and it's just as magical. During the opening credits you can hear his score and in it, there are hints to the songs from the first film. The production design on each of the sets looks straight out of the first. I just wished they took a bit more care in making the house look more like the original. There are some obvious details to it that make it not look similar. For one the entryway is entirely different. They had some unique transitions between the scenes of the real world and imagination. The atmosphere in this film was excellent. In each scene, it gave off the correct type of atmosphere that you would feel in that situation. Finally, I think there were a few scenes that could have been cut out and it wouldn't have affected the movie. Mainly because they did nothing with it later on. In the end, Mary Poppins Returns is an excellent film that is just as great as the first one. I give Mary Poppins Returns a 8.5/10.",

Emily Blunt is what I feel Mary Poppins should be, I will reiterate I have not seen the original (all the way through only mere glimpses) but she creates the character well and like many other characters in the film, has an outstanding singing voice. The child acting was rather phenomenal, and can I just address all people who seem to have a problem with the animation. It\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s classic 60\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s Disney ! And it\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s done so well ! The colour and style is so reminiscent of the old classics and made me gasp at how amazingly done it was.

Everything about this movie is heart-warming, personal, and gorgeous: the beautiful painted backdrops, the gorgeous score (including the incidental music), the subtle and nuanced acting, the cameos, the relevant and relatable story line, the stunning and tastefully derivative animation, the  fluid and artful cinematography, the very fitting and immersive set and costumes, the professional vocals and both catchy and clever lyrics, the morals, the subtle political and social statements, the fact that there are opening credits with an actual overture, and the very idea that Disney legends like Richard Sherman were consulted, all of it just provides evidence that Disney set out to make a truly excellent film that makes you cry, picks you back up, and reminds you the joys of being a wide eyes and open hearted kit again! This is truly an instant Disney classic that is enjoyable and impactful for children of all ages! I can see Walt Disney smiling down upon this movie for capturing the very heart, joy, love, and wonder that Dinsey was founded on. Thank you, Disney, and for everyone involved for making this masterpiece and for making me want to go fly a kite again! God bless and Godspeed!",

            "content": "Ignore the bad reviews. Believe in magic again. My grandmother loved live theatre, Broadway in particular. As a youth, I was brought up loving live performances on stage and musicals. I can remember so fondly, she used to bathe my sister and I in the tub, signing songs from \u201cSouth Pacific,\u201d inserting her own words. (I didn\u2019t realize that it wasn\u2019t actually \u201cdirt\u201d being washed out of my hair but \u201cmen,\u201d until I saw the show live on stage for the first time.) She would riff off songs from \u201cGuys and Dolls,\u201d dance to \u201cSweet Charity\u201d around the kitchen while making us sandwiches. I\u2019ve seen both the movie and stage show for \u201cMary Poppins\u201d more times than I can count. Suffice to say, I\u2019ve been excited for \u201cMary Poppins Returns\u201d for some time. I did not take time to sit and watch the Julie Andrews original prior to viewing this new installment. Do yourself the favor and follow my lead. You\u2019re going to compare the classic to the new movie, no matter what you do. It is easier to take them both as separate pieces if the classic isn\u2019t fresh in your mind. The filmmakers do enough with this new plot so as not to lose the viewer. I\u2019m sure there are plenty of Easter Eggs alluding to the original completely lost on me. Oh well. Even if you\u2019ve never seen Mary Poppins before and have no idea the original plot, just the fact that she\u2019s a nanny arrived to help will not be lost on you. Which brings us to my first point. For those of you who may have somehow not seen the original, you must go into this movie knowing that it\u2019s a musical. Hence the reason I\u2019m even talked about Broadway stage shows in the first place. Now, it\u2019s a not a musical in the same vein as the recent \u201cLes Miserables\u201d featuring Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway singing every single, but filmmakers make no remorse that this movie has music at its core. \u201cMary Poppins Returns\u201d even opens with a number sung by Lin-Manuel Miranda before the opening credits roll. That being said, if you\u2019re not a fan of movie musicals, I must tell you, stay away. In terms of Ms. Poppins, the title character whom Julie Andrews made magic back in 1964, Emily Blunt is (for lack of better description,) practically perfect in every way. Have no fear of airbrushed posters that make Blunt look like Cate Blanchett in smoky black eyeliner. She\u2019s bright, she\u2019s witty, she\u2019s charming, she\u2019s charismatic and she has a great singing voice. She was quite right for the part and takes the reigns artfully from Andrews, which I\u2019m sure was no easy task to do. Who would truly want to be the actor or actress to mess up Mary Poppins? Lin-Manuel Miranda is also great as Jack the Lamplighter, a nod to Dick Van Dyke\u2019s Bert, the jack-of-all trades drifter from the original film. Miranda features the same wry grin, smattering of dirt on his face and cockney accent that Van Dyke made famous. In fact, Jack trained under Bert as a child, probably while Bert was bouncing between jobs, never staying in one place for too long. Jack has known the Banks family since Jane and Michael were little. Jack remembers Mary from her first appearance and knows all too well of her legend. He\u2019s just as comfortable with her magic as Bert was the first time around. In terms of the music itself, I thought the songs were great. I can\u2019t sit here and tell you that there are better songs than \u201cSupercalifragilisticexpialidocious,\u201d or \u201cSpoonful of Sugar.\u201d Those songs have had 54 years to grow. I can tell you that there are plenty of songs that sound just like them. \u201cThe Royal Doulton Music Hall\u201d is an obvious (and welcome) nod to \u201cSupercalifragilisticexpialidocious\u201d (darn you for making me type that twice,) without being an annoying copy. \u201cTrip the Light Fantastic\u201d makes you feel nostalgia for \u201cChim-Chim Cher-ee.\u201d As a movie goer, you won\u2019t walk out of your theatre claiming that the songs are better than the original. Of course not, but it\u2019s hard for me to actually claim to like a song the very first time I hear it. I enjoyed almost everything offered here. I think perhaps this year\u2019s \u201cLet it Go\u201d might have appeared in \u201cA Star is Born,\u201d but \u201cMary Poppins Returns\u201d does admirable justice to it\u2019s classic predecessor. The film does fall flat in two places. First, Meryl Streep\u2019s role as Mary\u2019s cousin Topsy. This seemed to have just been a way of getting Meryl Streep into this movie, playing a role Johnny Depp could have been better suited for. The whole time she\u2019s on-screen deviates from the central plot, and was obviously just a way for producers to advertise Meryl Streep being it. I didn\u2019t find she advanced the story at all. She\u2019s fine in her role, don\u2019t get me wrong. She even gets a song. It also could have easily been cut, and we would\u2019ve been none the wiser until deleted scenes on the DVD release. Second, when Mary, Jack and the children are mixing cartoon with live action, the film does turn a tad dark, probably what earns it its PG rating. There\u2019s just a wee bit of child kidnapping and other nonsense. I just didn\u2019t believe that Mary Poppins would be into herself for so long and stop paying attention to what was happening to the children. In the end, \u201cMary Poppins Returns\u201d is everything I needed right now. It\u2019s fun, it\u2019s sad, it\u2019s imaginative. In a digital age full of CGI action movies, virtual reality, smartphones, tablets and social media, (all my son wants to do is watch shows on his tablet or play Fortnite.) Action figures collect dust on the shelf. White paper stays blank, paint and markers dry up. It\u2019s everything I can do to read books to him first, before he sits down to watch the movie. My failures in parenting aside, I do have fears that if I don\u2019t step in, my kids won\u2019t know how to properly use the spatial qualities of their imagination. One quote struck me from the movie, I don\u2019t see the point of mentioning a \u201cspoiler alert\u201d because I won\u2019t say which part of the film this turns up, and you can hear it during the movie\u2019s preview, \u201c(we\u2019ve all of us) forgotten what it\u2019s like, to be a child.\u201d Mary Poppins couldn\u2019t have returned at a better time. I didn\u2019t realize I missed her so much. I pictured my grandmother sitting next to me in the theatre, just enjoying the movie as much as I did. I could feel her smiling down on me as the credits rolled. I know that this movie would have been dear to her heart. This was the best movie I saw in 2018. I find it difficult to stamp a perfect score on any movie, but this one got darn close.",

Maybe this movie is hitting me at the right time in my life, but the mix of the fun escapism of the places the kids go and real life struggles that Mr. Banks is going through are fully realized and hit home. I grew up on the classic Mary Poppins and Rob Marshall made me feel that magic again. I really enjoyed this, you won't get anything you didn't see before but, it's well acted all around from Emily Blunt, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Emily Mortimer (who really fits the grown up Jane), Ben Whishaw, the kids in the movie, and some special cameos, it's a fun time at the cinema this Christmas and worth going to see.",

Musically, the movie fails miserably with not one of the songs coming close to those in the original movie.

I really enjoyed this movie from the songs to the musical score to the choreography to the set design to the animation to pretty much anything this movie has to offer. To me this is an amazing sequel to a classic movie and I hope they don't make another sequel like what Disney did with the Muppets but I hope they don't make another sequel but if they do it better be 50 years from now.

I understand it was rated PG, but, unlike the original, it has several truly scary scenes. it also touched on many heavy subjects. death, loss of security, nightmares, lying and deceit. also, there were many scenes where the father was very angry with his children. the orginal Mary Poppins did have a few scenes like this, but, it was more of a snip than a rant. the overall movie aesthetically was dark. as in the lighting, coloring, gray skies, etc. then there were moments of polar opposite brightness, color, cheery songs. however, it was maybe 30% happy and 70% dark or low/sad. there were points where the movie seemed to drag and the storyline would go over a 7 or 8 year olds head. mostly in regards to the songs. the songs were used to guide the characters to dealing with the perils in the storyline and were not straightforward. that's fine for an older viewer but for those that are younger I feel it left the scary parts more prominent. I went with 4 total adults and 6 children. the acting was great. the happy parts were cute, but too few. overall I was disappointed because I thought the movie would be fun and uplifting. we left with many of the children frightened and my daughter fearing she would have nightmares. my daughter is not easily frightened. I feel like Mary Poppins Returns was geared towards those that watched Mary Poppins as a child and are now adults and missed the mark for those that may be children watching for the first time.",

Having to explain why everyone fits the same mold as the original cast, while not being exactly the same, echoes the stiffness of the entire film. Mary Poppins Returns attempts to create a beat for beat remake of the original film by coming up with slants on our favorite Poppins story beats. The result is the feeling of being back in a musical, magical London that has us wishing for the old songs, cast, and adventures. Had this been a recast and a new Mary Poppins adventure that calls upon the beautiful of Travers books, this could have been a big win in the age of the Live Action Disney Re-hash. Alas, it is all too similar to Disney's Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which regurgitated Star Wars: A New Hope. You can't take an old film and rip off it's script beat for beat and come out with something fresh. Only originality will win back the soul of Hollywood. Mary Poppins had heart, and some great performances, but did not ultimately give us the new adventure it promised.

Since the whole image of Mary Poppins is prim-and-proper the dance scene in the tent I found inappropriate and out of character, not to mention a few other scenes (what a difference 54 years makes as to what is proper).  I think the writer and director focused too much on the fantasy world  with animation and green scene technology that they lost focus of the movie. The scene with the lamplighters (though intended to mimic the scene of the chimmey sweepers in the original Mary Poppins) did not fit into the movie and felt like it was just thrown into the movie to fill space.  The story was cute, but it just lacked the Disney magic of the original Mary Poppins. And lastly it would have been nice to see more of Dick Van Dyke in the movie.",

            "content": "In 1964, Walt Disney released an adaptation of \"Mary Poppins\" by P. L. Travers, and it became a huge hit. Not only did the film win several Oscars, but many have considered the film to one of the best Disney films ever made. However, Travers made more stories to the Mary Poppins character, and Disney never followed up. Until now. \"Mary Poppins Returns\" is pretty much exactly what one would get from the title alone. The film does offer a spectacular vision in both sight and sound, but lacks a decent story to tell. While \"Mary Poppins Returns\" may disappoint fans of the original film, it does offer up some great eye candy that's almost practically perfect in every way.\n\nThe story is set during The Great Slump (Britain's answer of the Great Depression). Jane and Michael Banks (Emily Mortimer and Ben Whishaw respectably), are now grown up, and are trying to make a living without their parents. Because of hard times, money is scarce, and Michael is trying to help raise his three children after his wife passed. Then, during a strong wind, Mary Poppins (Emily Blunt) comes in and seeks to help Michael and his children have a lesson in fun and not repeat what his father did in the past. With help from a person named Jack (Lin-Manuel Miranda), Mary Poppins and the children must try and help their father regain their house before something terrible happens.\n\n\n\"Mary Poppins Returns\" is something of a mixed bag.\n\nFor starters, the film is very impressive on a technical level. The sound design is excellent as it brings forth a lot of unique and interesting situations For instance, there is a scene near the beginning of the film where Mary Poppins and children are in an underwater  world, and the sound design really shows off here.\n\nNext up, the set designs and costumes almost feel like an exact replica of the original film, just with a modern coat of paint. The time period of the 1930s not is a tribute to when the original books were set, but also a good transition of time from the first film. Plus, the costumes look great on each actor, and compliment the movie very well.\n\nSpeaking of which, the acting is pretty good here; under the supervision of Rob Marshall, the movie has a wide and varied cast. Blunt really shines as a new and modern Mary Poppins, and she has enough spirit from the first film that she makes the character her own.\n\nOne of the big highlights from this film is the special effects. Yes, most of the time, the usage of computers is seen here, but for a brief and very exciting moment, we get a sequence where the main characters are in an animated world, and everything's all done in hand drawn animation. And it looks really good.\n\nNow, onto the main problems with the film.\n\nFor instance, the entire songs and music presented in the film just isn't as memorable as the Sherman Brothers main contributions. Plus, there isn't time for the audience to fully take in what just happened and fully catch their breath. This, in turn, can lead to some slow pacing issues, making the film drag; the original was slow, too, but there was a purpose for it as it showed what is happening with the story.\n\nSpeaking of which, the story is the biggest issue that the movie presents itself. It almost feels like the audience is watching a different version of the first film, just in a different setting. Plus, this movie has a main villain; Mary Poppins doesn't need a villain, and here, it feels forced and unnecessary.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Mary Poppins Returns\" almost feels unnecessary to do sequel, it does have its moments of creativity, but for intentions and purposes, the film tries very hard to recapture the magic that the original had.",

            "content": "It appears as though Emily Blunt took Benicio del Toro's advice seriously and left law enforcement altogether. Regarding her absence from Sicario: Day of the Soldado, she apparently time warped through the sky to pre-WW II London to teach children about imagination. Her experience in the battlefield of the drug war and not knowing who to trust has hardened her. Beneath her well-tailored demeanor lies the seething chaos of a perspicacious narcissist, hell-bent on bending reality to her whims.\n\nHer singing and dancing are only chameleonesque, peacock-like machinations to dazzle and distract the weak minded from her true intentions - some nihilistic end that we shall probably never fully understand couched within cautionary truisms. One wouldn't expect Disney to be taking this darker edged approach to their long-awaited franchise endeavor in the Mary Poppins IP, but they probably saw the worldwide box office returns for Batman v. Superman and decided to give it a shot. Believe it or not, however, I found myself dealing less with my own latent teenage angst through brutal violence and death and, instead, tearing up constantly from the whimsical joy of kind-heartedness and wonderment displayed in Mary Poppins Returns.\n\nSeriously, I couldn't stop crying. I don't know if there was an experimental, DARPA-made, sonic ray gun pointed directly at me or if sitting in the cinema for an accumulated 8 hours had bludgeoned me into a supple, emotionally compromised meat bag, but some strange frequency I had not felt since Paddington 2 blasted through my chest and left me weeping, a supplicant at the altar of Blunt's shrewd, yet caring Mary Poppins. If you've allowed yourself to become emotionally divorced from the sight and sound machine, I highly encourage you girding yourself at any upcoming screening of Mary Poppins Returns for fear of a melted heart.\n\nAnother way to cope with the onslaught of musical merriment, dazzling choreography, sweetly inquisitive children, and family-based morality is to remember that the film is a several decades late sequel, made as a safe holiday season cash cow. And if you can forego the cynical dismissal that it's an unnecessary movie banking on how similar it is to the original (a la The Force Awakens), you will easily be swept up in the joyous song and dance expertly pulled off by Blunt and Lin-Manuel Miranda accompanied by impressive 2D animated implementation and practical camera trickery.\n\nIf you want to condemn the soulless Hollywood machine for cranking out another crowd-pleasing entry in one of its multitudinous old stories, be my guest, but then you won't get to see a decrepit Dick van Dyke and Angela Lansbury eek out the last of their life-essence to the Illuminati on screen. As for me, I enjoy a nice lachrymal session in the theater. I may look like some weird dude in a Behemoth shirt weeping during a happy movie about a singing British nanny, but thankfully they keep the lights low enough during the screening that I don't fully give off the appearance of a mental breakdown.",

Yes it could be considered old fashion by many, but that is really the charm of the film.\nThe audience in the theater really got into the spirit of it with applause after many of the musical numbers.

I would even go so far as to say that Ms Blunts Mary Poppins felt a bit more real to me.  She seemed to feel more, to have a sense of longing, a touch of sadness - the spoils of being so wise.  I would chalk this up to the people behind the camera giving room for the actors to find their characters.  \n\nLin Manuel Miranda looked as though he were having the time of his life.  And that smile I mentioned having throughout the entire movie?  That smile was so huge during the dance number for Trip a Little Light Fantastic.  \n\nI brought my daughter, son-in-law (who by the way has a huge crush on Julie Andrews) and my 8 year old grandson to see the movie.

Though older, so many of the same characters that lived along Cherry Lane are back. I LOVED all the little references to MR1, that were there for the fans that watched MR1 so many times, but will pass the average movie goer. The music scores had traces of Sherman's score along most of the track. I liked the old woman's clothes from MR1 laying on the steps of St. Paul with all her doves. I would have loved a beautiful song such as \"Feed the Birds\" (not the exact song, but something memorable) in MR2, but I don't know it could have been placed with the current plot. I did love the scrambling of Dick Van Dyke's letters at the end as it was done in MR1 for him at the end. And what a glorious surprise to see Angela Lansbury in it and Meryl Streep. I did read the Travis books last year and I believe, the story of the \"second Wednesday topsy-turvy\" was in one of the books. I also was glad to see that the umbrella bird head got more speaking parts this time. In MR1, the parrot said quite a bit in the very beginning while MR was sitting on the cloud. But on all the versions I have found to buy, the parrot only speaks at the end. I have a lot more to say, but I strongly encourage all the fans of MR1 to relieve those moments of watching it the first time and go see MR2. It is supercalifragilisticexpealidocious!",

I honestly believed I was seeing the same Mary Poppins I saw years ago, older, more traveled, but still the same. The rest of the cast all did an amazing job, bringing back old characters, & introducing new ones. We even got some cameos & a surprise actor, no spoilers but rest assured, they're worth seeing.\n\nThe effects & set design were a treat. I really believed I was in 1930s-ish London, the Banks family home, & Mary Poppins' fantastical world. And while there was some CGI, it felt like most of the effects were done in the classic movies' fashion.\n\nThe music was classic Poppins & classic Disney, they went all out, the choreography also fit the film perfectly, like the dancers from the original film time hopped right to this one!\n\nMary Poppins Returns wasn't a sequel anyone asked for, but I'm glad we got it.

The best song of the film is \u00ef\u00bf 1/2where lost things go.\u00ef\u00bf 1/2\u00c2? Rather than humming or singing catchy lyrics after the film, I believe all of its songs went to the part of my brain where lost things go. A day later, I found myself humming greatest showman lyrics and remembering Laland. I still think Lin-Manuel is talented and I love his Hamilton music and his work for Moana, but not every song can be stellar.",

Lin-Manuel Miranda was fine in his role. I found him a little annoying but that might\u2019ve just been me. The film is nice to look at. The visual effects were good. Sadly, the film fails to capture the classic Disney magic we all know and love. The music fails to live up to the original. None of the songs really stand out. Also, the film doesn\u2019t really do anything new. It\u2019s your typical Disney film. Overall, Blunt\u2019s performance was great but the movie itself wasn\u2019t. It\u2019s too stuck in the past to do something new. ",

Most especially, to Emily Blunt and Lin-Manuel Miranda, those two absolute stole the show. However, even though the movie itself wasn't as much as a masterpiece as the original Mary Poppins, I will say though that in the future it can be remembered as one of Disney finest creations yet. Also, spoiler alert: I died and nearly got into tears when I saw the animation scene (especially with the part where Lin was going back to his old Hamilton roots and was rapping) that was my favorite part! Overall, I give this one a 9/10! I loved it!",

            "content": "Over 50 years in the making, Mary Poppins makes her grand return to the big screen in this brand new sequel to the 1964 original classic. Emily Blunt plays the practically perfect in every way magical nanny, originally played by Julie Andrews. Blunt does an excellent job bringing a new take on the titular nanny. She leads the film with an intrepid supporting cast including Lin-Manuel Miranda, Meryl Streep, and Angela Lansbury. Much like its predecessor the sequel is a musical that showcase brand new songs that are well crafted and really enjoyable. It not only features incredibly beautiful visual effects, but also a nice throwback with its combination of live action and traditional hand drawn animation. They do also include some nice computer graphic imagery in the film, most notably during the ocean scene in the \"Can You Imagine That?\" musical sequence. This sequel is a lovely homage to the legacy of its predecessor, while delivering a magical new Mary Poppins story that's familiar yet still an enchanting follow up to the 1964 film. \n\nWalt Disney's original film is both highly regarded, as well as considered a bit of a relic of its time. Although its appeal has not diminished with the iconic music, and memorable performances of Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke from the original film. Emily Blunt makes the role of Mary Poppins her own marvelously, with a stricter and firm portrayal than from Julie Andrews kinder take on the magical nanny. Blunt gives Mary Poppins a slight edge while maintaining her gentle side. The supporting cast do splendid jobs in their roles. Some honorable mentions include Lin-Manuel Miranda is very charming as Jack, a lamplighter and former apprentice to Bret from the original film. Meryl Streep brings a delightfully quirky performance as Mary Poppins Eastern European cousin, Topsy. Angela Lansbury (who voiced Mrs. Potts in the animated version of Beauty and the Beast) has a very sweet small role during an uplifting musical number towards the end of the film. \n\nThe musical score and songs is helmed by Hairspray songwriters Marc Shaiman, and Scott Wittman. Their songs are not only highly enjoyable but have a surprising amount of depth to them. Although, they lack the irresistible charm and feel more like counterparts to the Sherman Brothers tunes. That's not to say the songs are in anyway as bad as some would have you believe, they're beautifully crafted and feature some wonderful messages for both kids and adults. Some of my standout favorites in the film are \"Can you Imagine That?\", \"A Cover Is Not the Book\", and \"Trip A Little Light Fantastic\". However, the song that is my #1 favorite in the film is the one Angela Lansbury sings called \"Nowhere to Go but Up\". It's a truly beautiful finale song. Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman do a tremendous job integrating the songs while moving the plot forward at the same time.\n\nThe story of this sequel delivers a big dose of nostalgia. It tends to feel as though it almost mirrors that of the 1964 film, but still manages to expand upon its predecessor. Although, it hints at an important part of the plot rather early on in the film. The visual effects and animation are quite possibly even more magical than the original. I'm especially glad Disney stayed true to the originals legacy of using traditional hand drawn animation. Not only that the film also featured some pretty neat computer graphic imagery, particularly during the ocean scene in with the dolphins in the \"Can You Imagine That?\" musical sequence. \n\nOverall Mary Poppins Returns is a truly wonderful follow up to its predecessor. Emily Blunt is a fantastic new Mary Poppins for a new generation, with an equally impressive supporting cast. The score and songs are exceptionally beautiful. Even if you don't find yourself humming the tunes when the movies over doesn't mean they are necessarily bad, they just don't quite reach the standards set by the Sherman Brothers. It honors the legacy of the 1964 film with its music, visual effects, and animation. The plot is similar to the original, but suffers from revealing is plot quite early in the film. Yet it still manages to capture much of the magic of the original film quite brilliantly.",

But worth more than the scores here indicate. The only \u2018Meh\u2019 point is the Meryl Streep part, which is a counterpart to the \u2018Meh\u2019 point of Uncle Albert in the original.

Delightfully reminiscent of the original, it is a magical and heartwarming story for the whole family.\n\nEmily Blunt makes a wonderful Mary Poppins. She looks the part, for certain, and her voice is perfection. She nails the iconic character's quirks; her briskness, her no-nonsense nanny-ing, her unapologetic self-admiration, her mysteriously knowing smile. Lin-Manuel Miranda plays a lamplighter named Jack, who is an unexpectedly delightful character. With his mischievous smile and easy charm, he wins you over immediately. Ben Whishaw and Emily Mortimer are also lovely as the grown-up Banks children. The newest generation of Banks kids are all delightfully, amusingly precocious. And the rest of the cast, including Colin Firth, Meryl Streep and Julie Walters, are all unsurprisingly fantastic as they portray a wide variety of eccentric characters.\n\nI've read that some people were less than impressed with the soundtrack. Yes, it is true that it does not quite compare to the legendary songs of the first movie, and some of the numbers are disappointingly mediocre. Others, though, are much catchier and memorable, with 'A Cover Is Not the Book' probably being my favorite.\n\nOverall, this is a fun, whimsical and light-hearted film. Yeah, it is a bit cliche and predictable. But with the colorful 2D animation and plenty of other nods to 1964 original, it is a great film to watch if you want to feel a bit warm and fuzzy.",

It's not a matter of any bad casting decisions; it just did not have the charm of the original one. The music was not as good, and the movie relied more on heavy special effects to keep the audience captivated. The story was also darker than the original. The original was more fun. This one tried to be fun, but it was a little bit forced. The situation is  more tragic: Michael Banks is now a widower and a father of three children. He's fallen on hard financial times. The very bank that his father worked for, and he now works for, is going to take his house, if he can't pay off a loan he took out, or prove that he owns bank shares. They can't find their certificate for the shares, and the guy who now owns the bank tears the page out of the record book of the Banks family and burns it. Michael spends most of the movie in a funk. In the original film the main conflict was that the father was a workaholic, who left the care of his children completely up to a nanny. Although his wife was a suffragette, when Mr. Banks was  home, she acted very submissive and he was very chauvinistic..The movie shows the humor of the domineering male. If you had not seen the original movie, you might think this was really good, but for those of us who know the original, it pales in comparison.",

            "content": "I really like this movie. I don\u2019t love it as much as the first, but, I do think it\u2019s a worth follow-up to a practically perfectly aged Disney classic of nearly 55 years. Emily Blunt does Julie Andrews Justice as Mary Poppins. Ben Whishaw also makes a good combination of humor, sadness and vulnerability to the role of an adult Michael Banks. Emily Mortimer does do a good job of taking on the role of Jane, though I do wonder how she\u2019s able to stay happy and positive in a movie where her brother is on the verge of a mental collapse. As for as how Lin-Manuel Miranda did in this movie as Jack, he did pretty good, not Dick Van Dyke-level good (more on him in a little bit), but, I do think for his first feature film role coming off of Broadway productions like \u201cIn the Heights\u201d and, the obviously big one, \u201cHamilton\u201d, this is a good start for his feature film career. Now, as far as the set pieces and visual effects, I really think they were well put together. The one set pieces that stood out to me the most were the underwater sequence (which I think will give Rob Marshall his keys into directing the live-action \u201cLittle Mermaid\u201d for Disney, especially if people like how James Wan was able to pull of the underwater settings of \u201cAquaman\u201d, too) and the sequence where Mary Poppins, Jack and the Banks kids go into a China bowl for the insanely hyped return of 2D cartoon animation mixed with live-action, which I will say is the big colorful highlight of the movie that I hope people really like to get Disney convinced to do more hand drawn animated films in the future and/or more 2D animated/live-action hybrids such as the long in-development \u201cEnchanted\u201d sequel called \u201cDisEnchanted\u201d. Now, as far as the songs, there were only a few that really were memorable to me: \u201cUnderneath the Lovely London Sky\u201d, \u201cCan You Imagine That?\u201d, \u201cTrip a Little Light Fantastic\u201d and \u201cNowhere To Go But Up\u201d. But, I do think the rest of the movie\u2019s music and the orchestra conducted by Marc Shaiman fit perfectly with this movie and felt very grand and classic. And, I will say Dick Van Dyke\u2019s very excellent returning cameo as Mr. Dawes Sr. had to do with one of these songs and I\u2019ll leave you to guess which one it is. Now, if you had asked me which one of Disney\u2019s two live-action franchise continuations/sequels I enjoyed more, \u201cChristopher Robin\u201d or \u201cMary Poppins Returns\u201d, I would say \u201cChristopher Robin\u201d because I really was hyped to see Winnie the Pooh return to the big screen since as a child, he was the Disney character I related to the most. But, I will say that this movie, as a movie for the whole family, is worth your time and should be seen, in Dolby Cinema format especially, since the color grading feels more clearer. So, overall rating: 8/10 or 4 stars. \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f",

            "content": "Walt Disney's proudly-achieved sensational classic \"Mary Poppins\" soared off the pages of P.L. Travers' book onto the screen, delighting families, then eventually shared to generations, with wonder and whimsicality as well the true definition of a family film. This kind of classic is frequently considered as independent, a one-hit wonder that doesn't need a follow-up to duplicate the magical originality that was brought into the cinema. If there was ever a follow-up announced, there is inner intention of offering a story for the current generation with remembrance and nostalgia under experiencing the replicated magic, while there is also the outer doubt on being up to the original's par. Fifty-four years later, \"Mary Poppins Returns\" is right at the standardized perfection as [permitted] reassurance.\n\nA few decades since the original visit, the Banks family are struggling against the Great Depression after a devastating tragedy occurred. Then as fate has it like before, the magical nanny Mary Poppins returns to help the now-grown siblings and Michael's children to get through this difficult time, and remind them what they lost touch in.\n\nThe premise may seem to follow the \"history repeats itself\" trope, particularly when transferring roles to the next generation with the exception of the main character being an indirect inspirational source of subtle motivation. Even though I didn't get the time to view the original predecessor prior to the revisiting, the reliance of the structure did felt to be derivatively focused on the original while putting in new ideas that maintains the story's ideals. While it may be frown upon as a criticized flaw, it is actually understandable when continuing the story after a large gap of decades in between the two films.\n\nDirector Rob Marshall used his notable theatrical skills to take us back to Cherry Tree Lane with fantastic art direction and honoring Walt Disney's ambition of bringing the titular nanny onto the screen - physically and magically back to the screen in this case. This can be considered Marshall's best work at the most special when he managed to nostalgically bring back the grandness from the original's time, especially the purity of Disney magic that is more direct to the film's own definitive stance. One of the few aspects of the said magic that resurfaced from the original is the new animated sequence in all the missed, forgotten glory as a proposed comeback for the medium's initial form.\n\nThe most prominent factor that declared \"Mary Poppins\" a classic is the music that furthers the whimsical wonders as an extra filling to the heart at delightful levels. Marc Shaiman's composed score rejuvenated the classic grand feels, including the defining of Disney and the expressive return when the spectators are being transported into a magical world whereas dimensionally impossible imagination is realistically possible. The songs follows the sequel structural arrangement for similar tunes at fitting narrative placement with own meanings being carried. Now they may not be at the iconic level of the original's soundtrack, they still carry lovely and excellent tunes at some being quite almost as memorable as the predecessor's while the score itself is just plain great.\n\nFinally, next to the music in the soul is the excellent cast's performances showing such capability of continuing a story's legacy through the main energetic source from the characterization. They all fulfilled their roles to the fullest of the original's heartening content with their own narratively-active part of reaching right up to the previous standard. Lin-Manuel Miranda's performance parallels to the still-talented Dick Van Dyke at that age with the musical charm and the choreography's extravagant center. Then the main star taking on the challenge of filling in Julie Andrews' titular shoes is Emily Blunt with a simple descriptive quote of her performance and the film as the year's most whimsically wonderful picture: \"Practically perfect in every way.\" (A+)\n\nIf Walt was still alive at age 117, he would've floated up to the ceiling with tears of joy.",
