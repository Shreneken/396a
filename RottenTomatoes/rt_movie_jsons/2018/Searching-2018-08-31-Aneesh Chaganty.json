The movie treats the internet as a proper entity in the story that is involved in solving the mystery.\n\nOn that note, this story involving the Dad, David Kim (John Cho), searching for his missing daughter is incredibly compelling. I was constantly on the edge of my seat trying to solve it with the Dad but also being shocked at all the twists and turns. Within the story is also a heartfelt story about grief and love. On that note, John Cho does an amazing job! I also loved Debra Messing as the Detective who aids David in the search for his daughter.\n\nThis is one of the best mystery thrillers and is a must-watch!",

            "content": "If you've got a missing persons case, would you rather have on the job: Sherlock Holmes with his pipe, Hercule Poirot with his moustache, or John Cho with his Excel doc?\n\nThough it's got to make a few reaches in order to craft a murder-mystery/family drama out of images you could find on a screen (what grieving father would agree to stream their child's funeral for a bunch of strangers?), Searching is an inventive film with a main hook that updates the literal trail of clues to a series of virtual puzzle pieces. It doesn't skimp on the family drama, with an introductory prelude about a beloved family member dying that almost rivals Up, so the film isn't just a loose premise with nothing else to back it up. The film's inventiveness almost works against it at times, creating drama or stretching believability when the script is at its strongest when it wallows in a parent's greatest fear (the final twist in particular kind of bugged me), but the film is engaging pretty much the entire time even when it has to coast on Cho's intensity alone. No way Margot doesn't get into that music conservatory with a backstory like that. \n\nLove the sanctimonious Facebook posts, that's the most realistic part of the film. (3.5/5)",

In most movies of this nature, this is done as gimmick and does not feel natural in the story telling. But here, the technology is seamlessly integrated into the story where the two are inseparable. John Cho does an excellent job of being the lead here. His emotional connection with his daughter is a driving force of the plot and the turmoil he goes through in discovering that the connection he has with his daughter was all on the surface is superb. The unknowns surround our leads daughter creates so much tension and mystery as we are trying learn about the character along side the father. The editing is top notch here as the story maintains a very coherent progression while balancing multiple windows and views of the computer screen. There were plenty of twists in the story, some worked well and others fell flat for me. The movie does a little bit too much at the end, but overall was great.\n\nScore: 79%\nVerdict: Great",

            "content": "I thought this was quite an intriguing film, in terms of making the viewer (particularly if its the younger generation) realise how much of our lives we may put online, whether that be behind a private, password-controlled account or not. It was an ironic film to watch at the time for me personally, as it just so happens I've decided the other day to make an effort not to be on social media as much as I used to be, as it has stressed me out and raised my anxieties a bit, particularly during this pandemic time (I'm typing this late Jan. 2021).\n\nAnyway, the film is good - perhaps a little slow but not entirely badly paced. Everything we see is shown via webcam video footage and we see the father, who only after a while realises his daughter appears to have disappeared, typing and trying his hardest to access said daughters accounts, on the search for any clues to her whereabouts. I felt I could empathise with the situation he was in, not knowing too much about his daughters' social circle. Certain aspects of the plot that unfold, I felt I could personally relate to. On the slightly techy side of things, I'd almost forgotten about tumblr and I hadn't heard of MyCast either but I have now! also, I was surprised at the start when the dad loads the PC as it clearly shows an old version of Windows - I think XP but certainly, pre-Windows 7. Given this film was apparently released in 2017, it seems a pretty dated system to be running but maybe that's just the geek in me speaking up there? its not entirely relevant to the film I suppose. Having said that, I did notice that when video calls were incoming, they would often be branded as FaceTime calls (i.e. video calls communicating through iPhones), which implies its set pretty much in the modern-day.\n\nThe way the plot progresses isn't bad - there are frustrating moments and I saw things that made me wonder what had happened and all the rest of it but I'd say its a pretty low key kind of a film. Its thought-provoking in that it makes you think about how people and companies respond to certain situations. I won't say anymore so as not to provide spoilers but while I wouldn't say its an entirely amazing film as such overall, I thought it was quite good and certainly towards the end I did feel surprisingly gripped, so I would recommend it, yes.",

Debra Messing is less convincing as the police detective handling the case and often comes across more like an actress playing a detective than an actual detective.  The story is intriguing from the start and has more than enough twists, turns, and red herrings to keep the audience guessing.  Despite that, the surprise ending is a bit of a stretch and seems like it was pulled out of a hat, but there is enough good stuff prior to the climax to make Searching well worth the viewing.",

Write a novel, without using the letter e; make a movie, using the computer screen- not quite as stringent. \nStage of life: as a father, how does one bring up a daughter, roughly.\nA man has been trying to keep his house together, following the death of his wife. Signs that he is running out of energy appear, but he has not yet lost touch- and so notices , pretty soon, when his daughter disappears. In chasing down the details of what has happened to her,  he also recognises his perceived failings as a parent.\nReaction: Music: good. Costume: didn't notice, so... good. Script: bit patchy. Acting: Fine. Didn't like David going gung ho/point blank- I thought his coolness, was the entire point. Didn't much go for, twist about the cop. Or Isaac's delivery, after camping- bit obvs. Camera-work: Good. Direction: Who is the narrator? problem. If the idea is, here is this story- that we only see, via the interactions people have on computer- then I'm not sure it stuck to that rule. However, I am genuinely not sure; it might have done. Included CCTV with the cop. Result: A thriller that thrilled! but two thirds of that down to the music, sorry. Hope and trust you are well- thanks and good night.\n\n0) I thought, the rush through 'mother has cancer', yanked the heart strings.  \n1) Actually, when it turns out, the cop did it... I'm crazy. I had a thought , though, that Singing in the rain, is a three-hander- just, the woman changes form. Here, mother father, daughter. So the cop, is a new mother figure. All of her storyline, then, could simply be, rage built up, against the mother, for leaving the father with all this work to do. Rather than plot.\n2) Hardest thing, for a teacher to let go. Say, you know how to make baked Alaska. Something in you then does not want to see, a second rate baked Alaska. So, you discourage incompetent pupils. However. What you maybe have then, is a child or pupil, who is not independent. Now here, it is not safe, for Margot to be out on her own? right. Ostensibly. But with one of the final images, being David almost literally dragging Margot up out of a ravine ... Doesn't bode well, for her developing independence. Point: he's billed as a hero... is he?\nIf the point is, he missed out on picking up on her mood before, then how will he fare better at that now, popping punches at dodgy potential boyfriends and charging around? \nDoes it use beautiful people to get your attention? Yes- all good looking people.",

            "content": "Ok, I know, you probably haven't heard of this one, but it's not THAT obscure, it was out in theaters! This is a low-budget film about a man whose teenage daughter goes missing with no explanation. So, pretty standard story, but it got a fair amount of attention and praise for the way in which it is told \u2013 the entire movie is comprised of various forms of computerized media which all takes place on a computer. It literally never leaves the computer screen, using video chats to IMs to live news streams and every possible other form of media in between to tell the story. Even the title is a clever play on computer lingo. If that sounds odd to you, then you would be correct. It's an innovative way to tell the story, but I was never able to fully adjust to it. It actually starts to get irritating after a while, as the film creates more and more contrived situations in order to maintain the story within the limits of its own conventions. I mean, nobody uses Face Time that much. Luckily, there is John Cho to keep the audience invested, and he does just that. It's his performance that grounds the film in reality, and he is utterly believable as a widowed dad living out the ultimate nightmare of every parent: not only the nightmare of having your child go missing, but also discovering that you don't even know them. God bless John Cho! On the flip side, there is also Debra Messing, who is absolutely godawful as the lead detective on the case. Her terrible performance almost cancels all the authenticity that Cho has created, and it can only partially be blamed on the cheesy dialogue. The story is a good mystery, effectively leading the protagonist and the viewer down a trail of red herrings only to spin you around and bring you back again. Regrettably, the twisty-turny resolution is downright ludicrous, and the Scooby-Doo ending wraps things up way too neatly, effectively destroying any suspension of disbelief you may have mustered up throughout the movie. The movie has its merits, it is an engaging mystery and the twists are unpredictable, and it has a surprisingly potent and unexpected message about how we handle grief. But the story would have been better served by not adhering so tightly to its solely media-based convention and just told the story using a more traditional method, innovation be damned. I'll give it some credit for spinning a fairly standard tale in a way I've never seen before, but I would have given it a lot more credit if it worked. Ultimately, it all boils down to a feature-length gimmick. ",

This highlights how much of our lives and interactions take place on such platforms. Yet, it also shows that such a new point of view can tell a compelling story.\n\nThe plot itself is engaging and keeps viewers at the edge of their seats. Difficult to pull off for such screenplays. Yet, Searching does this well. There are moments we think have solved the mystery only to be thrown yet another curveball. The viewpoint also allows the audience to be in the same shoes as David Kim as he attempts to solve the mystery of his missing daughter.\n\nOne complaint I do have about the film is David Kim's character. John Cho does a phenomenal job as David Kim and goes over the top where you expect him too. Yet, his over-the-topness can sometimes alienate the viewers. But I won't take too much off for that -- his behavior is believable for a father-in-distress.\n\nThere are also lots of hidden things that first-time viewers may not catch but will find on a second viewing. Searching is definitely a film one can watch and rewatch time and time again.\n\n4.5/5. Lots of applause for telling a captivating story through a new technique. Aneesh Chaganty deserves lots of praise for pulling off such an impressive feat.",

The opening scene already pulls you into this family and into their lives and experiences. The way the story unfolds and the way the information is carried over to the audience is well done. Of course most of the movie is news-exposition, and I dislike that, but I didn't mind it amongst all of the other ways information was being delivered to the audience. John Cho gave an amazing performance and the directing was top-notch. The twists in the end were also really well set up and really hit hard.

You search for the daughter along with John Cho, you discover things as he discovers them, and the twists just keep on coming. The twists are well earned and upon second viewing (and the next 4 viewings, I love this movie) you realize how well established they are. Every word of dialogue is very carefully placed and chosen. To me, this movie is a classic and unique, in the same way that 'District 9' is. There's no other like it. (I know 'Unfriended' exists from the same producer, but 'Searching' is in a league of it's own). Do yourself a favor, Watch this movie if you haven't seen it. John Cho and Debra Messing are both amazing in it. Cho brings so much heart and nuance into it. It's so we'll written and directed. You will feel like you are hanging from a string and it can snap at anytime, but hope is just on the other end. Watch 'Searching' today! ",

            "content": "Searching is one of the most fascinating movies that I've come across in a while, due to the style of shooting being from the perspectives of electronic devices. It is a refreshing take on cinematography, even if it grows a bit tedious.\nSearching centers around a single father, David Kim, whose daughter, Margot, has gone missing. In order to find her, David has to break into her computer and phone, and in doing so, find out all the aspects of her life that she had hid. He is aided in this, or so we are led to believe, by Detective Rosemary Vick. The scenes of David searching through his daughter's online presence, his interrogation of those who knew her, and his communications with Detective Vick play off quite well from the phones and computers. This perspective provides a new angle from which to see the character, their interactions, and the world around them. This in turn, lends itself to some interesting comments about the dangers of the internet age. Despite all the ways we have to connect with people, the characters, especially those who are family members, are shown to rarely communicate their true feelings, and as such grow increasingly isolated from each other. Even when Margot turns to the internet as a release for that, live-streaming herself to, and talking with, an online audience, we are immediately put off by the amount of personal information she shares, especially with a disturbingly frequent viewer, fish_n_chips. The predatory side of online marketing and cookies is also shown, as after news that Margot has died spread, a service to livestream her funeral contacts David. However, this perspective of film loses its allure about halfway through the movie, when David finds Margot's car, and the filmmakers are forced to use increasingly ridiculous mediums to stick with the electronics idea. A prime example would be David installing spy cameras in his brother's house to document their conversation, instead of using a phone with a voice recorder turned on, like a normal person. To the movies credit, it never fully breaks down, or is stretched to the point of disbelief, but perhaps switching to a more traditional style of shooting in the second half would have benefited the movie.\nWhere this film never loses it edge though, is in the story. As we previously mentioned it's about David trying to find his missing daughter Margot, and actor John Cho plays his spiral into despair perfectly, knowing when to control his emotions, and when to just let them lose. It is devastating seeing David learn how little he knew about his daughter, and how he failed to be there for her after his wife's death. Debra Messing is also great as Detective Vick, coming off as competent, caring cop, but leaving you with just the hint of a sense that something isn't quite right with her. As revelation after revelation come through about the characters, and David heads into darker and darker territory, the movie's pacing is remarkable in how it allows each of these moments to have their impact, while never losing sight of the overarching story. The big twist is extremely rewarding due to its painstaking set-up, it's perfect timing in the story, and its is emotional execution. While some might find the ending too convenient and feel-good, I personally think it was very tasteful; like the Shawshank Redemption, Searching forces us to sit through overwhelming amounts of heartbreak and injustice, but in doing so, we are given a happy ending that feels earned.\nWhile the marketing might be led to believe that this movies is a meta-commentary, in all honesty, it is much more of a family drama. While the cinematography is fascinating, much more than just a gimmick, and the portrayal of internet culture feels honest and fair, where this movie truly shines is in its portrayal of the complex relationship between family, and the equally heartwarming and heartbreaking lengths a parent will go to for their child.",

The premise is what had me interested to watch the movie in the first place, but the storyline twist was so bad I was literally laughing out loud. Along the way of finding his daughter, he actually accuses his brother of having sex with her and killing her with the most pathetic movie writing I've seen - innocent flirting with her uncle, which later turned out to be talking about pot? So stupid. But the twist at the end with Debra Messing's character (and horrible acting) was straight out of a high school play. The scenario presented was unrealistic and provided no suspense...we could see what was coming a mile away. Speaking of seeing things, no one ever saw a body in this open ravine next to a road? I'm just baffled how so many respectable movie critics give this movie any respect, much less rave reviews. ",

Short of the halfway point, a headache began for me, so I intermittently forwarded to its unrealistic end. What a DISAPPOINTMENT. Like others, I suspect the many 5-star ratings are from shills. As this newer release ages, its rating will better reflect public opinion.\n\nFor the ENTIRE movie, you are watching nothing but monitor-based imagery and footage, while simultaneously following around a screen's cursor much of the time. This includes window multi-tasking, along with internet searches, face-time, social media, and video/audio playback ALL within monitor perspective, POV (point of view), from various characters or via cameras that happen to ALWAYS be on (yeah, right). This device helps to AVOID traditional artistic cinematography and direction. Consequently, it's not really a pleasurable experience; its more of an EXHAUSTING one - nearly 100 minutes of Google and Apple product placement that could also serve as a tutorial for those with ADHD.\n\nTo make matters WORSE, the acting was unexpectedly abysmal; SPOOF-LIKE and unintentionally humorous and flippant when it probably was not meant to be. The ending resolution is a ridiculous EYE-ROLLER, but it thankfully doesn't leave you hanging (as with some art films) and is ultimately optimistic, albeit an easy way out in some ways. As millions can attest, the possible resolution to a missing person mystery is much more complex, time-consuming, and without guarantee...often darker too. This film is like a TEEN version of a LIFETIME movie.\n\nTonight I wanted to get off my computer and simply enjoy a movie - to escape, in a sense. NOT with this film, which is aptly titled. On the viewers end, \"Searching\" requires *actual searching* in order to follow things. If my eyesight drifted away for even 5 seconds, the sparse dialogue did not allow the audio to easily fill in gaps, as happens with most film. One must watch the clicks and keystrokes to not miss anything...so if you don't like reading SUBTITLES, this movie might be annoying. While I never mind subtitles, this film is simply too visually demanding, especially as a psychological thriller of sort.\n\nSKIP this wannabe thriller and watch a movie that helps you to truly escape into a story that does NOT seemingly play out within a software, internet, and social media TUTORIAL from a MONITOR PERSPECTIVE.\n\n-March 2019",

I was still a little apprehensive because unfriended: dark web was the worst movie i saw last year and most tech-thrillers like this are cool on paper but dont turn out the best (for example, The Den was pretty awful but Unfriended was really good for what it was). Needless to say, i was so pleasently surprised by this film even with how high my expectations were. The way this film is edited is AMAZING and thats not even the best part about it. It was written in such a real and raw way it was hard to believe it was just a movie and i really felt like i went on this journey right alongside the characters. The acting was absolutely phenomenal from every single person involved, especially the man who played David; he was the most compelling main character of a thriller ive experienced in such a long time. The plot was so incredibly unique and well-done that it cannot be ignored. And if im going to do a proper review, i NEED to talk about all the easter eggs hidden throughout the film. These easter eggs made the film even better and more expansive. There were a few plotlines happening thatbyou wouldnt know about unless you pause the film constantly, but i found one and followed it consistently as the film went on. While it may have been a silly and slightly far-fetched story, it really revealed a whole new layer of care and consideration to me and showed just how much the filmmakers cared about and for this film. This movie was unbelievably satisfying and refreshing and i cannot wait to see more from these writers/directors. Theyre going places and it cannot be ignored. I may be a little dramatic in saying this, but im serious when i say this is a masterpiece. If you havent seen this film and you enjoy thrillers, it is an absolute must-watch. Its extremely tense and well plotted, the characters are nearly 4 dimensional, and the editing is beyond mesmerizing.",

Similar to how other movies expanded from Blair Witch Project though, there is an odd subtext here.  For example, Blair Witch Project altogether made sense as a \"found\" footage movie, whereas later movies of the type raise the question of \"who found this and who edited this altogether?\"  Searching has a similar oddity.  Unfriended was real time and straight on, Searching uses the format more to tell its story in a unique way.  We are not stuck to one computer, and even on one computer the camera will still pan around the screen.  There are montages, timejumps, and cuts across different machines.  It threw me off at first, and made me wonder why this format was even necessary if they weren't going to stick to it.  However, since so much of this story takes place in the internet, I can accept its format.  I mention this right off the bat because a lot of critics have praised this films format, and I really can't as much, since it feels like they cheated with it a bit to me.  However, the elements within the format work well enough that I can forgive it.  Watching him use the computer and all the steps he goes through are effective.  It feels extremely genuine down to all the weird little details, like using a string of \"forgot password\" chains to get into his daughters Facebook and find out more about her friends.  It's little details like that which we don't necessarily need, but make the film more real, and watchin his whole process is strangely hypnotic and engaging.  The overall reaction of his daughter's disappearance is all too real as well, with media reactions running the gamut and blog think-pieces we see brief headlines for on the side.  These little details give an air of realism to the whole thing.  As for the actual plot itself, it ultimately works fine.  One thing I did appreciate is that the red herrings given are more than just detours, they add character depth.  However, the ultimate reveal doesn't feel that shocking.  It's fine, it works, but that's it and the movie ultimately goes out without much of a bang.",

            "content": "Taking the microgenre within the found footage genre of the all-on-your-computer-screen genre (I guess it's a thing?), Searching expands from the formula in Unfriended.  Similar to how other movies expanded from Blair Witch Project though, there is an odd subtext here.  For example, Blair Witch Project altogether made sense as a \"found\" footage movie, whereas later movies of the type raise the question of \"who found this and who edited this altogether?\"  Searching has a similar oddity.  Unfriended was real time and straight on, Searching uses the format more to tell its story in a unique way.  We are not stuck to one computer, and even on one computer the camera will still pan around the screen.  There are montages, timejumps, and cuts across different machines.  It threw me off at first, and made me wonder why this format was even necessary if they weren't going to stick to it.  However, since so much of this story takes place in the internet, I can accept its format.  I mention this right off the bat because a lot of critics have praised this films format, and I really can't as much, since it feels like they cheated with it a bit to me.  However, the elements within the format work well enough that I can forgive it.  Watching him use the computer and all the steps he goes through are effective.  It feels extremely genuine down to all the weird little details, like using a string of \"forgot password\" chains to get into his daughters Facebook and find out more about her friends.  It's little details like that which we don't necessarily need, but make the film more real, and watchin his whole process is strangely hypnotic and engaging.  The overall reaction of his daughter's disappearance is all too real as well, with media reactions running the gamut and blog think-pieces we see brief headlines for on the side.  These little details give an air of realism to the whole thing.  As for the actual plot itself, it ultimately works fine.  One thing I did appreciate is that the red herrings given are more than just detours, they add character depth.  However, the ultimate reveal doesn't feel that shocking.  It's fine, it works, but that's it and the movie ultimately goes out without much of a bang.  \nI had some issues with Searching's use of it's format, but it was fast and tense and I quickly got wrapped up in it.  John Cho is a charismatic lead, and there's a genuine feel to how it handles everything.  It really grabbed me and held my attention, but it just didn't quite stick the landing.",

If it's not told by the screen of a computer, it's TV or phones, cameras or old videos. This is a very nice touch and the fact that it's actually working is pretty amazing. It sounds very unwatchable, but as people dig the net and other information bits for clues we go fully into the story ourselves. It's like you are in front of the computer - snooking around for stuff.\n\nThere are many great turns and twists here. They are smart and I never saw them comming - still they made sense after small hints are placed but not really catched - the way I like my hints for twists. I like the acting and the story, it's a bit to \"heroic\" from the dad's side at times, and some happenigns seem a bit unrealistic, but I left the film pleased without many questions or anoying loose threads. It's pretty high-tech, but a person with mediocre plus computer knowledge should hang on to it reather easily.\n\nI expected the film to be OK, but it was actually great and it's been a while since a film made me sink in so deep as this one did. This film has great storytelling and a fair amount of suspence.\n\n8 out of 10 browser tabs.",

            "content": "Absolutely brilliant!! The double exclamation marks are well deserved. 27 year old Aneesh Chaganty does an incredible job with the direction of this film, who I recently learned is of Indian decent which makes me more proud of him on a personal note.\n\nThis film comes under the found-footage film category. If you don't know what that is, it's the train-wrecks of films like Paranormal Activity, Into the Storm, Project Almanac, Chronicle and Cloverfield. Okay the last two aren't too bad but I generally dislike this genre because the shaky camera feels are extremely annoying and it even feels unrealistic how the camera can stay on for so long and all. I didn't really expect anything much going into this film. To be honest, I was just really intrigued by the poster and the synopsis. Few minutes into the movie I had finally come to the conclusion that it was that sort of film and started to get extremely anxious about it. Funny thing was when I started the movie I really wanted to use the restroom so I thought I'd pause it at the 5 minute mark or something but man! I couldn't. It was just so engaging. So interesting. So intense. So gripping. And by the end - the final 15 to 20 minutes - you won't be able to breathe. In the beginning, we the viewers are presented with nothing about the daughter as her social media is private. But this movie brilliantly encapsulates the power of social media, the internet and technology as a whole. Our beloved protagonist literally solves the entire crime 'virtually' through the computer. And choosing to shoot the film by the found footage method just empowers that statement.\nThere's a powerful piece of social commentary that I found to be a very real expression of the social media system: as the father attempts to gather information get daughter's friends, he finds out that none of them were very close to her. Later on in this movie, after the daughter's disappearance becomes viral and trending, those people begin to take to social media to express their sadness and turmoil of her loss - all for the likes of course.\nIt doesn't just grip you story wise, which is brilliant of course but you get so emotionally attached to the character, the father and the daughter. You get worried with them. Jon Cho delivers an exceptional performance. You would probably even shed a tear by the very end after all the numerous plot twists. One of the best movies of the year without a doubt and one of the best thrillers I've seen (hopefully that's not jumping the gun).\n\n8.5/10",

Its predecessors are silly horror movies, while \"seeking\" has a wonderful character development and comes at the apex of dramatic development such a genre can achieve. Aneesh tells us the story of David, a father who falls into despair after the sudden disappearance of his father, an anthem. daughter and the same one spends the following days investigating and collecting information on the whereabouts of his daughter, among all this, has development in all the main characters of the long, family conflicts, mourning, virtual insecurity, maternal protection, Haters and depression, sentimental story police directed by the American debutant director Aneesh is a cinematographic experience, because besides the innovation in telling its history, the same manages to present and to touch in all those subjects that I spoke in a much more intimate, simple and true way, since all are inside of the virtual scope, which we all share, is a common link that closely matches the viewpoint pain to the work. It is difficult to evaluate the technique or the performance here, first of all, John Coh and Depra Messing are great, and technically, well, his look is beautiful, his photography clear and above all, the technical aspect that appears the most, his edition, which is great and \"Searching\" has problems, especially its third act that has holes and runs too far, where the explanation of the act is surrendered to the rhythm and the outcome, and disappointing a bit, plus a few humorous escapades without meaning, but is the best film of the genre that I have seen, and certainly one of the most interesting and cool films I saw in the year.",

Perhaps the greatest quality of this film is how it seems to be just as much a social commentary as it is a suspenseful endeavor. The story unwinds from the perspective of the presence of technology's pervasive influence in our lives. You watch the story of a father searching for his missing daughter from a computer screen. The deeper concept seems to be the superficiality of how connected and disconnected we truly are through our devices and modern mediums of communication. This film embraces its modernity in its execution and design. Societies change and evolve and this movie responded accordingly in storytelling and presentation. I'm slightly surprised as to it's such high rating as it felt like the story never smoothly incorporated both technology's influence on our lives and the gravity of a parent's worst nightmare-a child going missing. Overall, I highly recommend this movie but feel like it's a one-time viewing. However, the artistic application of what the writers and directors were trying to accomplish was very apropos.",

This movie takes place in California in the present. It starts off in the point of view of a computer, setting up the whole story and depicting how it would be told. The viewer learns of a small family: a mom, a dad, and their daughter. The first few minutes simply show how the computer has been used through the years and why the characters are in the situation that they are, with the mother having lost her life to a form of cancer. After that, the viewer must pay careful attention to every small detail, in order to keep track of the story of a man solving the mystery of his daughter\u00e2(TM)s disappearance. The entire foundation of the movie is set on technology and the dangers it can cause. Overall, the movie comes to a satisfactory end and does a great job of using the technology as a base. It can be great to watch as a family, but there is talk about drug use and a few heavy themes(suicide, abduction, incest is suggested subtly, and of course murder).",

Atmosphere, suspense, the unraveling of an unexpected mystery, it was all pulled off without any swearing or even real violence, yet everything worked to well. \nWe've seemingly become numb to gratuitous violence, sex, language and cheap scares from these genres it's unexpected when a smart, well done piece comes along.

Of course, it was him/her/them.\" But I was wrong. The film was smart enough to play off my expectations, show some familiar archetypes, and then develop new twists. The second half of the film's success has to do with the characters' development. I FELT for David Kim and his daughter. With hardly any narration, the film was able to set these beautiful complex characters and let them do their magic. I can hardly believe that this is Aneesh Chaganty's directorial debut. I look forward to seeing more of his films.",

The idea of my child just disappearing is the most nerve racking, anxiety creating thought process I can think of. And from the moment this movie starts, it banks on that. I was sucked into the father daughter relationship between Cho and newcomer Michelle La, as their relationship is already strained following a shocking opening act moment that had me in tears. NOTHING would matter, if we didn\u00e2(TM)t care about the characters and because it does an amazing job inviting us into their lives from the start, I began to find myself shaken up and nauseous as this giant web of deceit lured me in.\n\nDirector Aneesh Caganty\u00e2(TM)s directorial debut uses a unique delivery method to tell it\u00e2(TM)s story and I was frankly surprised at how much I enjoyed it, as it uses the technology and the screens that surround us on a minute to minute basis to show David\u00e2(TM)s (Cho) reactions as he tries to put the pieces together of the intricate puzzle left behind by his daughter.\n\nAlthough this movie has a few supporting roles in the cast, this is the John Cho show. Cho, whom we all remember as Harold from Harold and Kumar, is incredible in this and easily showcases his best work as an actor, as he goes from concerned to scared, confused to angry, sad to straight vicious all within the timeframe of the movie while reacting to the news and clues he finds throughout.\n\nHeartbreaking at times, this well-crafted mystery with quite a few unexpected twists and turns had me at the edge of my seat is easily one of the best surprises of the year;\nIn its style,\nin its story,\nin its execution\nbut more importantly in its warnings. \nGrade : A",

In this opening montage Chaganty along with co-writer Sev Ohanian as well as their editors, Nick Johnson and Will Merrick, swiftly establish who our characters are and where they've come from so that the viewer is keenly aware of the point each character is at in their lives as well as providing an equal balance of clues and intrigue as to what headspace these characters might be wading through as the film then delves into the current predicament the movie will chronicle. Searching is ultimately about relationships, the toll that grief, sorrow, and shame can take on certain dynamics as well as how different people deal with and react to such emotions. Moreover, Searching filters this exploration of dealing in such emotions through the guise of the ever-evolving technology of our modern world; commenting on the highs and lows of documenting our every move. Naturally, it's nice to be able to capture so much of our everyday lives and share achievements and moments with those we both count as friends and those we'd just kind of like to show-off in front of, but there's also that drawback of constantly having something to post or log in the simple fact that some memories are best forgotten while others we may eventually prefer to not be reminded of. Of course, Facebook hardly lets one forget anything these days and thus is the genius of Chaganty's film as it places the audience firmly within the perspective of John Cho's David Kim not through who he is or the circumstances of his life necessarily, but through how he conducts himself online and how his documentation of life events is likely akin to any given audience members. In the aforementioned opening montage, we see David go through the joys of fatherhood, the love of a genuine marriage, and the heartbreak of a tragic loss all through the (Microsoft) window(s) frame of social media, Skype, and of other means of chronicling our day to day integrate themselves as such painting a more and more fully realized picture by the time we're up to present day. This technique is efficient in establishing a set of characters and circumstances for which we become invested, that we care about, that we're curious about, and ultimately somewhat concerned about even before the main narrative kicks in all due solely to this opening montage that hooks us line and sinker. In short, it's a prime example of expert craftsmanship.\n\nread the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com",

The platforms are used in clever ways and we never feel like we miss any of the story. John Cho (David Kim) gives what might be the best performance of his career, while Debra Messing (Rosemary Vice) is strong. The story has an incredible amount of twists and turns. It\u00e2(TM)s kind of hard to surprise us these days, but there were at least two or three moments that genuinely shocked me.\n\nWeaknesses: While the plot twists were very interesting, they did come across as unrealistic. In fact, a lot of what happened throughout the film forces you to question the believability of it all. While it\u00e2(TM)s the only flaw I can think of right now, it\u00e2(TM)s a major one that takes away a fair amount from the film.\n\nOverall: One of the best films of 2018.

The kidnapping concept is nothing new, but with the frantic search taking place entirely on computer monitors, phone screen, CCTV cameras etc, it does truly bring the genre into the 21st century. It's great to see John Cho, the infamous MILF guy from American Pie, being given the chance to spread his wings and take a stab at heavy drama, and he does a great job. He rarely goes over the top, and mostly internalises his anguish, allowing the moments when he loses his cool to seem much more authentic. The film has a real sense of escalating tension, and much like 12 Angry Men, it involves you in trying to solve the case, giving you the puzzle pieces to put together. I wouldn't rush to watch it again, since a mystery film is never the same on the second viewing, but it's still a great watch, and sets the standard for films based entirely on screens and monitors, something I imagine we'll be seeing a lot more of in the near future.",

Movie Review\n(10/10)\n\n    Searching is told via computer and smartphone screens, a device that helps elevate the final product. The decision to have the mystery unfold through the devices that consume our everyday existence helps complement the movie's themes about personal connections and the dangers (and benefits) of technology.\n    Chagnaty never feels limited by working on this canvas, keeping the proceedings visually engaging throughout Searching's taut runtime and making something mundane like a web search feel very dramatic. There are some neat tricks on display (see: the \"sleep screen\" transitions to indicate it's a new day), and the technology component helps Searching feel fresh and unique, despite the on-paper setup (teenage daughter disappears) being familiar. The news article\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s are filled with easter eggs, and if you are really paying very close attention to the details on the screen, you will find out the abductor halfway through the film.\n    Searching isn't just an exercise for a showy new style. It helps greatly that Cho gives one of his finest performances as David. One does not need to be a parent to empathize with his character, with the actor brilliantly portraying the desperation of the situation. What makes Cho's turn stand out even more is that he has an opportunity to explore various sides of David, taking part in some actions that are morally questionable (but justifiable from his point of view), forcing the audience to contemplate what they would do if they were going through the same thing. Cho has to do much of the heavy lifting and carries Searching on his shoulders, proving he's a more-than-capable leading man.\n    The supporting cast is great, even if all the focus is meant to be on David. Messing is a strong authoritarian presence as Vick, serving as a nice foil for the increasingly concerned and despondent David. The two stars play off each other nicely, despite most of their interactions taking place through FaceTime video chats. Joseph Lee is also good as Peter, David's stoner brother, who has more layers than one might initially think. As for La's Margot, she is a little more than just a human MacGuffin, as there are important moments of character shading that clue the audience into the kind of person Margot is.\n    In the end, Searching is a most pleasant surprise, serving up a gripping narrative and an outside-the-box concept that works in spades. Chagnaty announces himself as a director to watch, and it'll be interesting to see where his filmmaking career goes from here. Don\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)t be surprised if you here this movie\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s name come up around Oscar Season.\n(P.S.

Widower John Cho has had trouble connecting with his teen-age daughter, yet doesn't realize how out of touch with her day-to-day life he's become. And one day, she disappears suddenly, and foul play is suspected. He works hard to solve the mystery himself, and collaborates with a police detective (Debra Messing), uncovering some dark secrets in the meantime.\n\nThe gimmick with this film is that the entire story is told through a computer screen. Facebook pages, you tube videos, emails and messages, old videos stored on hard drives, etc. Lots of video chatting. (The movies UNFRIENDED and UNFRIENDED: DARK WEB used the same device.) It's a low-budget let surprisingly effective and immediate story-telling device. We share with the father a sense of discovery. We learn as he learns. He doesn't know things we don't know...nor do we know what HE doesn't. It's fun, but on occasion, the credibility of this is stretched pretty thin...and when dad has to step out of his house, we still keep up with him because he is the subject of news reports that we get to watch. So yes, the device is clever but often strained.\n\nWhat really works well in the film is the convincing work by star John Cho. He's come a long way from his HAROLD AND KUMAR days, and gives a well-rounded portrait of a smart man, crushed by grief and now confounded by how little he really knows his daughter. (He finds out, for example, that she has stopped going to her once beloved music lessons...but has kept the money and said nothing to her dad.) His convincing work makes us look past the confining story-telling device, and pulls us into the emotion of the story. He makes SEARCHING more than just a clever story...it has a real emotional impact.\n\nThere's a real mystery here, and it takes a couple of pretty cool turns. I found myself surprised a couple of times, EVEN as I then berated myself for not having \"seen it coming.\" But hindsight is always 20/20...I liked being surprised.\n\nSomehow, this movie didn't garner a huge audience in the theaters, even though it is vastly superior to others of its ilk. It truly has some pulse-pounding moments, a reasonably intelligent script and a very solid central performance. I highly recommend you seek it out and enjoy the ride.",

            "content": "social media satire that it whips you with..\n\nSearching\n\nChaganty's nail-biting thriller is a real gem on delivering the crisp and the current social media satire that it whips you with. Considering it is his first major motion picture, Chaganty is a force to be reckoned with. His obvious gravels that are hard to chew, in its initial stages, is so flamboyant in the latter ones, that you are happy to let them go by, as you are practically giddy up for more of the sweat drop precision that amps up the charge. It is very well and calculatively constructed structure that despite of having a newer territory to explore, still follows one's familiar textbook formula; Chaganty went safe on that section. To create an entire picture that is fixated on a screen and tell a story through it, as much as that idea is appealing, it also is immensely difficult to pull off, since even though the technology has come far enough to give you quite a range to explore in it, Chaganty does feel short handed at times, and finds himself straining a bit on screen which is something that should not have been visible to the viewers but unfortunately it actually is.\n\nThe subjective procedure of the investigation might be rudimentary but is immensely entertaining and thoroughly enthralling to encounter. The real romance of Chaganty's is how he weaves out a character out of tiny notions and objects, to an extent that you start caring for that object or a piece of message that it is carrying. The antics installed in this crime drama is something to be learned from, not only are they a huge supportive base of the plotline but also essentially the heat of the soul.\n\nThe narration is not only gripping and adaptive but layered and thought provoking, no matter how itchy the short stories might feel like, they are crucial to the plot points. Obviously, there isn't much range offered to the actors to factor in, still Cho is delivering all he can from his guts; he makes you care for him. The supporting cast is a similar victim of the concept as Cho is, there is very little and in bits and pieces for them to do in so much time. The crust of the feature that it surfs through which is also its distraction, is thoroughly gripping and the makers have equally invested their time and sweat into it to be as convincing as possible.\n\nSo these little notions or piece of informations keep giving us hope whilst the real trick is happening somewhere else entirely. The makers also plays with you subconsciously where they impute various ideas and innuendos on the screen for us to look at it as clues while actually all it does is throw us back from the real game. It is a very smart tale retold with a fresher perspective than we usually get, it keeps you tangled in its search. Searching may not be path breaking on terms of storytelling but as far as technology and cinema is concerned they are walking in parallel in here.",

And the whole story is told from computer screens.\n\nThe huge difference with his predecessors is that Chaganty doesn't use the resource in a sinister, cold technophobic frame. At all. \"Searching\" understands the normalization of the technology in our social relationships and includes it organically in its narrative. Technology isn't villainous or mysterious, but smooth-running and familiar.\n\nIn addition, Chaganty doesn't just stay on a visual gimmick. He uses the opportunity to better describe the characters by the way they use their devices' interfaces. That way, a desktop image full of thumbnails (and the way they got there) becomes a great cinematic moment. That's truly a huge achievement in directing, and Chaganty should have way more recognition for that.\n\nThis is a nice surprise that is going straight to my 2018's top.",

I thought that the story and characters would suffer for it, and in some ways I was correct.\n\nHowever. The \"gimmick\" allowed a classical thriller to become something more, to become relevant to our time and culture. Where detectives of yesteryear would search for clues gazing through a magnifying glass, the investigations of 2018 involve more digital footwork than physical.\n\nAll of the performances were captivating, and it was nice to see a modicum of character depth and development despite the film's gimmick. I look forward to John Cho's next leading role.\n\nSearching, like every thriller of its like, contains many red herrings before the final reveal. Some are obvious, and others are more convincing. As soon as the uncle's sweatshirt was seen in Margot's (Michelle La) car, I suspected that my thoughts about Peter (Joseph Lee) were correct.\n\nThis film provides a necessary, if somewhat obvious, object lesson of today's culture: people are connecting more to devices, and less to each other. It was heartbreaking to watch David (John Cho) discover that his daughter truly didn't have any real friends. That she was suffering quietly every day.\n\nOverall, Searching is an excellent thriller that uses a unique gimmick to tell a heartfelt story. Definitely one of the better films of the year.",

Thirty seven hours after his daughter has gone missing and without a single lead, David searches the one place no one has looked yet, where all secrets are kept : his daughter's laptop as he traces his daughter's digital footprints before she disappears forever.\nPremiering at this years Sundance Film Festival , Searching has been on the receiving end of some lavish critical praise and has also fared well at the box office and it's not difficult to see why.\nThe visual execution of a modern thriller, using the props so common in our daily lives, such as smartphones, laptops etc. is a tool that works magnificently and adds both to the tension of the film and also the strong moral message attached throughout.\nThe writing and direction from Aneesh Chaganty is also admirable as the film zips along at a steady pace, with the viewer always engaged with plenty of twists and turns along the way.\nJohn Cho, in his first lead role shows the audience what they have been missing as he is central to everything good in this feature and delivers a tour de force as grief stricken father David Kim.\nThe timely nature and relevance of Searching is what makes it stand out however, as it not only uses modern technology to deliver a frantic and palpable thriller but also makes a strong social statement on modern society.\nIn general, Searching is fast paced, visually inventive tense thriller containing strong performances in a film that will not disappoint!",

Unlike many found footage entries, writer/director Aneesh Chaganty has put considerable thought into the mechanics of his storytelling gimmick. The opening sequence even reminded me of Up as far as how deft it was with the economy of storytelling while providing an affecting emotional blow. In the opening, we watch a little girl grow up as computer technology and websites also advance documenting her life, culminating in her mother getting cancer and passing away, communicated via a \"Mom's Coming Home\" date removed from a calendar. It was so well done I actually felt like I just might summon some tears for the passing of this woman. Right away I realized I was in for something special. Flash forward and the teen daughter goes missing and her stressed-out father (John Cho) dives into the investigation firsthand by looking through her online history and realizing how little he may have known his not-so-little girl. The movie illustrates nicely how easy it is to hide your real self online and how easy it is for others to find you and your digital impressions. Every time Cho is visiting a website, whether it's Venmo or Instagram or Facebook or a webcam, there's a solid reason for it and the movie has a satisfying step-by-step progression. The mystery has plenty of unexpected twists and turns and it's anchored by a harried and distraught Cho (Star Trek Beyond), who does not look like he's in his mid 40s at all (Kal Penn has also aged well, which makes me only want a cross-generational Harold and Kumar sequel more). The only knock on Searching is that there really isn't a pressing need to see it on the big screen. After all, you're watching a computer screen and typing for much of the movie. It will play just as well, if not better, on your home television or whatever smaller screen is at your discretion.\n\nNate's Grade: B+",

This movie shows the typical nightmare that any parent of today is facing and takes a deep, extremely realistic look at our use of social media, plucking away leaf after leaf of what we all love so dearly today. Our smartphone, pad, Pc and Facebook, twitter, etc. Even though I never had (and never wanted) kids, I felt deeply disturbed by the dilemma this guy/father is facing. Each time one thinks he might get to a solution, he ends up in a dead end again, and one starts doubting about our own reality nowadays. After I left the cinema, for at least 20 minutes, I kept on saying: Oh Damn, Holy Cow, Oh Gosh, as I simply couldn't get this perturbing situation out of my head. This is surely the best script of any movie I've seen within the last 2 years. Not silly scary like a stupid creature or ghost horror movie, but tense to the bone, as this situation could involve any of us on any given day. Though I don't consider John Cho to be a good actor, he is just the kind of simple everyday person to make this role become realistic. So the casting was just right. 9/10 points.",

            "content": "Every parent's worst nightmare plays out in this film directed by Aneesh Chaganty.  A widower (John Cho) finds that his teenage daughter (Michelle La) has disappeared, and begins frantically going through her social media and online presence in the attempt to find clues about what may have happened to her.  Helping him is a detective (Debra Messing), and the more he discovers, the more he finds that he doesn't really know his daughter at all, which is further unsettling.  The film thus has several gut-wrenching components of loss - losing the wife/mother (Sara Sohn) to cancer, having a child disappear, and gradually discovering the image you have of a loved one is woefully incomplete - for isn't disillusionment another form of loss?  \n\nCreative in its story-telling, which is entirely from the perspective of interfacing to various devices and applications in the modern age, the film also serves as a highly realistic 'documentary' for the way we connect to the world for so much of our lives.  It's hard to believe now, but in a few decades the technology shown will likely be viewed as quaint, and in time may fascinate watchers of 'old' movies as much as little elements in films from the 1930's tickle us.  I was worried this might be too gimmicky or impede the film in some way, but it doesn't at all.  At the same time, while the computer interfaces feel highly realistic, there were elements in the story that weren't, for example, its timeline, and some of the actions of the characters, but I don't want to spoil it.\n\nThere is real tension as the film plays out, because of the emotional stakes involved, and because we really don't know what's going to happen.  There are just enough possible suspects and aspects of the evidence that we get led down a few different paths in our mind, perhaps similar to the roller coaster ride the father is on.  I'm not sure if John Cho's performance has enough angst and grief in it, but he's reasonably strong, as is the rest of the cast, and in a very interesting way, the film explores the depths of parental devotion.  Solid film.",

            "content": "A Homo pad's Look at Life Around\n\n\nThe Homo sapien as a biological species has a strong ability to discover and accumulate knowledge (writing books, creating songs, study). His counterpart is the Homo pad who has the ability to distribute and retrieve information. Homo pads look at life through the interface of modern software devices (ipads and iphones, chats, social media, streaming and broadcasting video system). In this movie, \"Searching\", the concept of how one looks at reality through the computerized world is examined. It is obviously a great achievement in directing (Aneesh Chaganty) and photography (Juan Sebastian Baron& Will Merrick).\n\nThe way of storytelling in this movie features surfing from screen to screen, browser to browser, window to window, tab to tab. This is a fresh and new trend for the big movie (see Profile, 2018; Hardcore Henry, 2015; Black Mirror, 2011-,). This technique allows us to look at situations through the eyes of characters, to be online with characters, to be a part of the character's user activity. This screening modestly simulates immersive theater with its absence of any barriers between actors and audience. \"Searching\" lets movie viewers join that quest to discover the mystery of the disappearing daughter of David Kim (John Cho). For the touch-screen generation, whose lives interact with smartphones and touchpads, this movie provides an easy way of perceiving and reading the procedural narrative for rescuing a lost person. Additionally, this movie presents some life hack about how to act in complicated situations. For example, jus do your own research anytime: classify and eliminate information on irrelevant issues; try to involve more people for troubleshooting; trust people and information, but don't forget about reviewing and double-checking. \n\nAlthough the tech features of the movie are its most original aspect of the picture, viewers can discover one strong social message. It is about the parents responsibility. The movie raises the issues of the role of parents in the maze of their children's social media and IT. There are two clear patterns of parenthood: David with daughter Margot, and Rosemary (Debra Messing) with her son. They have absolutely different styles of parenthood and it is difficult to say which is the best example of parenthood. David is a typical perfectionist with an engineering education, who has a well organized PC desktop and files in folders. Rosemary is a detective, who swings from one project to another, usually with an untidy hairstyle. If their children didn't have problems, the parents wouldn't engage in discovering the children's social network. Technology has been extremely helpful and useful for David's and Rosemary's families in their search for David's daughter (Michelle La). \n\nAs can be seen, the delivery of the Searching story via Homo pads look, provides the movie making process with this new concept. It pulls viewer into the heart of the movie. Emotionally it enhances feelings and totally engages in the movie narrative. This form of observing the story enhances the emotional reaction of the viewer. Probably, without touch-screen special effects the storytelling of the movie would be boring. Regardless this, tech fans will applaud for IT framework, and regular moviegoers also will enjoy this story.",

What connotes depths of connection with furtherances of technology? In the film, documenting is a huge factor which is a habit that aids the recovering family though comes with emotional challenges for the documenter because the recordings are memories so easily and vividly accessible.\n\u00a0\nThroughout the film, the emotional experiences are so visible through the actors; agony, concealment, conceit, deceit, depth, shallowness?-? but so ingrained in the film as natural by the actors portraying these sentiments. What is character beyond the ever-present face of individuals receiving amplification because of modern technological developments? A subtle question I find in connection with the title and the development of the film is, what connection is anyone really searching for with so many different mediums available to connect with others? We're connecting in connecting on connecting through connecting with connecting, but?-?what's really flowing between humans that draws humans to be so?\n\u00a0\nEach character in Searching has a reason for being in connection in their location physical or virtual; each character has their own path set and connecting becomes a very selective process heavily shown among the aspiring individuals in the film. Yet?-?there is an underlying connection in which everyone is shown in connection deeper than each of them might seem privately which proves that people care though with their own intentions?-?though I think even more so in recognition of a life and the meaning of the life in connection with their own.\n\nI think Searching is a really good film addressing some modern social concerns and I think the film's title is apt. I'll always be a fan of short films before feature length films. Writing a review about the film makes me ponder the last time I've read a mystery novel. Cyber security and virtual social networks are definitely matters for discussion. Safe environments, virtual or physical, improve social interactions.

She disappears and he starts to find out several disturbing facts about her. Clarification of her situation is delayed until finally the police are contacted. The father - David Kim (John Cho) goes through several common techniques to break into his daughters social media. Again, just the right amount of details so you can follow along but not get bored. Each contact or app/website adds to the mystery. There are several great plot twists prior to the last 2, which you'll probably appreciate as much as me. This is so well done, the story believable I'd be surprised if it doesn't at least make the short list for all the awards this year",

            "content": "From first-time writer/director Aneesh Chaganty, Searching\u00a0is a mystery thriller about a father's desperate search for his missing 16 year old daughter.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWho'd have thought paying to stare at a computer screen for an hour and 40 minutes could be so damn worthwhile. The computer-screen movie is by no means a new concept in Hollywood but it has been pretty hit or miss with a number of quite good and very bad films making use of this approach. Searching\u00a0however proves that this approach of experiencing a story entirely through a computer-screen can give off phenomenal results as this is by far the best film to make use of this technology. From beginning to end I absolutely loved Searching, it's a riveting and thrilling story with well fleshed out characters, incredible performances, and plenty of emotion to go with it. With this still somewhat experimental format things could have gone either way but the execution of this story here is near flawless. As the mystery unfolds the pacing hastens gradually, building suspense with each passing minute and throwing you through a rollercoaster of emotion and unpredictability. Every development had me cowering into and creeping off the edge of my seat due to the unsettling nature of the idea of a young daughter going missing.\n\nChaganty hooks you into the story from the opening sequence through sheer emotion and character depth and continues to explore and develop these personalities over the course of the film. The story manages to capture so many complex tones in being unsettling as well as deeply moving and even making room for a brief moment or two of light humour. It's amazing how much is encompassed within this story and it has come out so immaculately intact.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI was surprised by how much I felt for the characters in here most notably the father played phenomenally by John Cho. It's an emotionally moving story centred around this father who will go to the ends of the Earth to find his missing daughter and you see every moment from his point of view and how he unravels throughout every event. The character development is just great and even the secondary characters are well built up and fleshed out enough to make them all interesting. John Cho's lead performance is incredible as he carries every moment of this movie with how much he gets into the role and delivers the emotion of this story so effortlessly. He's someone you can instantly get behind from his backstory which is all fantastically covered through the opening sequence.\n\nThat's another thing, this movie manages to tell backstory and fill in gaps in characters amazingly well. It gives you so much information in so little time that the majority of the runtime can be focused on the main story at hand. Condensing a lot of information into a couple of scenes is very difficult but Chaganty manages this without issue predominantly through the opening sequence alone. He sets everything up so well that all that's left from there is to let the story play out and not have to go back and forth through time with long exposition scenes.\u00a0The supporting roles are also very strong and the characters are well fleshed out and engaging in their own ways. Deborah Messing and Joseph Lee\u00a0are the two supporting performers with the most screen time and they too play their characters really well building on the emotion of the story through some great interactions with John Cho.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThere's a touch of social commentary in this story that I found very effective and quite engaging or entertaining at times. It's pretty subtle and doesn't bash you over the head with the messages it's trying to send and actually is one of the many highlights of the film. Also from a more technical standpoint and the way the story is told visually through web browsers and FaceTime on the computer screen and other electronic devices I found it all very easy to take in. It never gets frustrating or boring watching someone navigate through a computer because A) the story is gripping and holds your attention the whole time, and B) there's almost always some other element adding to every scene. Whether it was FaceTime open in the corner of the screen, or a voice-call happening in the background, or simply the chilling score kicking in there was always something to engage me on top of the story unraveling.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI highly recommend checking out Searching as it's a fantastic mystery thriller, the best computer-screen movie, and hands down one of the better films of the year. In terms of tone I got a vibe similar to that of another phenomenal mystery thriller in Prisoners (2013), just maybe not as dark and disturbing as that film. John Cho's lead performance is exceptional and will keep you enthralled in the story in every moment. So if mystery thrillers are your thing and especially if you loved Prisoners I'd say this is a must watch.\u00a0\n\n9.3/10",

I just happened to stumble across it here on rotten tomatoes, saw the 92% rating, and figured why not give it a shot.  Let me tell you, Searching was the best thing I didn't know existed since I discovered Trader Joe's cookie butter. I was skeptical with the seemingly boring premise of \"Dad uses internet to find missing daughter,\" but the plot came together nicely with a solid cast and characters with a twist that is doubtful anyone will see coming. Another thing done well is its interesting decision in going with the 4th person/POV style (a style typically not done well) in which everything you see is from the perspective of watching the dad's computer screen as he searches through his computer, FaceTimes his daughter, or as if you are watching a real-time view of a news story on tv.  All-in-all, Searching delivers with a heart wrenching tale of a dad in his endless search to find his daughter that will have you following along in this roller coaster of emotions and situation that any parent would consider their worst nightmare.",

Later in the evening in an episode of \"Ballers\" there were sections of texts being exchanged. (An aside: television has to learn to fill the screen with a text so it can be read!)\nToday I saw the movie \"Searchers\" which, from beginning to end, takes place on computer screens, smart phones, face time chats, facebook, google, dozens of hook up sites, vblogs and anything that can be done on the social media sites of a desktop or laptop.\nThe film opens with montages of David Kim (John Cho) and his wife Pamela (Sara Sohn) happily raising their daughter Margot (various actresses at different ages with Michelle La at the age of 16) until Pamela's death from cancer. Through FaceTime chat between father and daughter we see they are very close and are adjusting as well as they can.\nMargot does have a habit of forgetting her job of taking out the garbage and David, jokingly, affectionately, sends her picture of the overflowing kitchen garbage can and she responds, apologizing, saying that she will take care of it the first thing when she gets home from school.\nMargot doesn't make it home!\nNot wanting to give anything away, you know, spoilers, I'll just say it becomes a mystery with the father going through everything on his daughter's computer and phone to find her. There are a few red herrings but if you follow it closely and are good at solving mysteries you might get the answer.\nAlong the way we meet Detective Rosemary Vick (Debra Messing) who is leading the investigation and has a teenage child of her own, David's younger brother Peter (Joseph Lee) who is more laid back than the older brother, along with schoolmates, teachers, chat room friends and people who claim they knew Margot more than they did.\nThe only deviation from the Internet and cell phone are a few television broadcasts but I was really surprised how easy it is to hack a website that you may think is so safe.\n\"Searching\" is a decent mystery thriller told in a different form which will hold your interest. John Cho is the center of most of the screen shots and holds your attention whether it is showing the feelings for his daughter, his mastery of today's technology or showing the range of emotions going through him not knowing what happened to his daughter.",

While this has been done before, it proves more effective than gimmicky here, and underlines the point how modern life is totally captured, and lived, on screen. After a scene-setting prologue that tips its hat to the same in Up, the narrative settles on the father's increasingly desperate search, effectively utilizing textbook Hitchcockian red herrings and detours. This is essentially a storyteller's film and under Chaganty's confident control and with John Cho's David Kim, the everyman/father who anchors the film in such an engaging and believable manner, this is an engrossing delight. Debra Messing also co-stars as the detective working the case and even though it is hard to see her as anyone else but Grace from Will & Grace, we do get a glimpse of her dramatic side which isn't often seen. Interestingly, in the context of the Crazy Rich Asians phenomenon recently, I feel more galvanised here, seeing the casting of Cho and the film's family as Korean-Americans, when it could easily be cast differently. Highlighting the fact that a parent's fear of losing one's child is universal, this casting decision quietly but significantly makes race an irrelevant issue, which must be a good thing for both Asian actors and the promotion of a better representation of Asians in general on-screen.",

I just don't think it possible & again, can't say why without letting too much out here. Plus once they committed to that narrative, I thought it bought in too closely to many horror-flicks which to me, few do it well so I'm discerning & critical there. \nWhat should compel you is to watch this Dad use his brain like no other, totally amid insurmountable stress & chaotic upheaval.

            "content": "A beautiful, gut-wrenching drama that may turn out to be one of the year's best. \n\nAfter David Kim (John Cho)'s 16-year-old daughter goes missing, a local investigation is opened and a detective is assigned to the case. But 37 hours later and without a single lead, David decides to search the one place no one has looked yet, where all secrets are kept today: his daughter's laptop. In a hyper-modern thriller told via the technology devices we use every day to communicate, David must trace his daughter's digital footprints before she disappears forever.\n\nThere was something about the trailer of this film that just got to me. The intensity, the brilliant marketing, the acting, it all looked so good. And to be honest, this has been one of my most anticipated films for a while. When I saw this film on opening night, it was nothing less than amazing. In fact, it's one of my favorite films of the year.\n\nThe film starts out with this emotional look into their family life. It had a mix of nostalgic feelings and utmost emotion. From there, it maintained that level of emotion and kept us clinging to our seats. Throughout the film, we were given moments of sadness, intensity, and question. We were constantly asking questions and constantly turned around, just to be left in the middle of one giant puzzle. It was fun, to say the least, if not flat out extraordinary. \n\nThe acting in this film really meshed well with the style they approached this with. Like a couple of films in recent memory, this film takes place entirely on computer screens. I thought that in addition to powerful performances from John Cho and co. really made this film so heartbreaking. It felt so real and so scary in so many different ways. I felt very connected to the characters and I felt as though I was smack down in the middle of this situation. \n\n\"Searching\" is a scary film. It's scary because of how real it is. It shows the lengths someone will go to to find their daughter. I think I can relate on an emotional level to this film but right now, I can't understand what that'd be like for a parent. The film took so many different twists and different routes but in the best way possible. I never felt tired of this film and it kept me on a roller coaster of emotions. It never felt like it dragged on or slowed down too much and in a mystery-thriller, that's really hard to pull off. \n\nIn the end, I loved \"Searching\". It did everything so well and so beautifully and it's one of the most memorable of the entire year.",

My main issues with this movie are it's absurd amount of red herrings throughout the film that I feel on repeated viewing will just be those bathroom scenes and some humor that felt very oddly placed and sometimes forced. Also, I'm not sure how I feel about this movie's decision to add a musical score and so many cuts and zooms despite the fact that we are witnessing all events on a computer monitor and various found footage type mediums. Beyond that, this movie was a tension filled blast with touching moments and a surprising amount of brains behind its overall meaning.",

            "content": "August 31, 2018\n\n\"Searching\" is a missing person thriller that tells most of its story through a computer or phone screen, along with various messaging and social media platforms such as FaceTime, Skype, Instagram, and, of course, Twitter and Facebook. Watching the film, it's obvious what director and co-writer Aneesh Chaganty wants to say-that computers and the Internet, with all of the information they hold on us, make it all too easy for anyone to discover who we are, who we communicate with, where we've been, what we buy, and what secrets we keep. \n\nAnd yet, at the same, the film also argues that even though computers and the Internet can seemingly tell us anything about someone, they can also tell us nothing, and in fact they often leave us feeling isolated, bewildered, stressed out and anxious. Our devices and the Internet are a double-edged sword to be sure.\n\nOf course, this message is nothing new. There have already been several Hollywood movies that present this same commentary- \"The Net\", \"Catfish\", \"Her\"-so \"Searching\"'s argument isn't exactly groundbreaking or inspired. However, Chaganty's methods for delivering it are more unique and help an otherwise traditional genre picture stand on its own. Even though most of us look at a computer screen every day, having it play a pivotal role in a thriller plot makes it more exciting to watch, even scary, so the experience as a whole ends up having more significance than we initially expect. If it's a basic thriller you seek, \"Searching\" gets the job done; if you're looking for something more creative and substantive, it fills that role too.\n\nThe missing person in the film is a high school student named Margot (Michelle La). At first, when Margot doesn't come home from school, her father David (John Cho) thinks she's just at one of her piano lessons, or that she went on a camping trip with friends. But after a whole day goes by and David still hasn't heard from her, uncertainty and paranoia begin to set in, and as he begins \"searching\" for Margot through all sorts of digital channels, not only does he not have any idea where she is, he also learns he doesn't know nearly as much about his daughter as he thought. On one level, Margot is his little girl; on another, she's a complete stranger.\n\nYou'd think David and Margot were close, not least because of the film's opening montage, which shows David's wife Pam (Sarah Sohn) chronicling their daughter's happy and loving upbringing with photos and videos, saving them to her computer's hard drive and posting them on social media. The screen then switches over to Margot's desktop and her digital calendar as she marks the day when her mom gets to come home from the hospital after receiving cancer treatment. Sadly, this calendar event becomes unnecessary. \n\nDespite David being a widower and Margot a motherless adolescent girl, the way they speak to each other makes their relationship seem normal enough. But one of Chaganty's points is that what gets spoken or messaged between people isn't necessarily representative of how they actually feel. It takes real, open conversations to relay our emotions, and the film constantly reiterates the disequilibrium we experience when we don't know the truth about an aspect of our lives, especially when it's regarding those we love. And in this day and age, we often reach for our computers or phones to provide answers and relief, but they aren't always reliable.\n\nDavid eventually files a missing person's report with the San Jose Police Department and is somewhat relieved when he learns Detective Vick (Debra Messing) is heading the case. A quick Google search of Vick shows she's received several commendations and her Facebook page suggests she's a devoted mother herself. David tries to help out with the case, but his relationship with Margot compromises his better judgement and soon enough there are videos posted online of David picking fights with people he thinks are suspects. He even thinks his ne'er-do-well, marijuana-smoking brother (Joseph Lee) may have something to do with her disappearance, but again, the film underlines the fact that David's thoughts and feelings stem only from what he's read and interprets from a screen and not what he knows to be the actual truth. \n\nWhat the actual truth is in \"Searching,\" I'll obviously not reveal. It is, after all, a mystery and thriller. And to its credit, the mystery surrounding Margot's disappearance remains intriguing and unpredictable throughout, and yet Chaganty and Sev Ohanian's screenplay is careful not to cheat when it comes to the possibilities or plausibility of the situation. The thrills are genuine, too, no doubt because of the tension Chaganty creates just by ceaselessly showing a computer or phone monitor, which can be inherently agitating. The combination of the lack of humans, the bright, digital interfaces, and the sound effects of the messaging platforms often make for a distressing context. Chaganty is well aware of this and uses it to his advantage. Just as the plot unwinds and David makes new discoveries, it simultaneously winds us up and puts us in a state of genuine unease, which is the point of a film like \"Searching.\" And in addition to thrilling and entertaining us, the film could arguably serve as a warning about what can happen to our states of mind and general well-being when we spend too much time with (and rely too heavily on) technology instead of other human beings.\n\n\"Searching\" may be standard in a lot of ways and many of its points have already been made by several movies that have come before it, but even so, we leave the theater feeling engaged, stirred up and emotionally touched. John Cho is at the center of the film, and here he proves his range goes beyond crude comedies like \"American Pie\" and \"Harold & Kumar,\" as well as established franchises like \"Star Trek.\" He helps us get behind David and really empathize with his dilemma, not least because we can easily picture ourselves using the same media he does to find crucial answers, some of which, the film wants us to remember, can only be verified through human communication.",

Searching is an interesting film because of the way it's presented. The theater screen is the screen of a laptop following a father named David (John Cho) who is searching for his missing 16 year old daughter Margot (Michelle La). The story unfolds with David one night missing his daughters phone call and suddenly realizing the next day that she is missing after friends report they have no idea where she is either. As viewers we see David searching through social media sites to try and find her and getting help from a detective named Vick (Debra Messing). The two begin to uncover more and more things about Margot's life that David had no idea about leading to the question was Margot taken, or did she have something else happen to her? The movie does a great job with pacing. It even starts the movie in a similar way like the movie Up (2009) in the first 10 minutes that's very touching. You feel for David and the backlash he begins to get on social media. It's a fantastic movie that moves well and even takes place in San Jose, so it's slightly local. The film falls just a bit short because I thought it ties up just a bit too cleanly. I don't want to spoil it. Overall, it even has a twist I had no idea would happen, but when it does it's great.

Searching is about David Kim's investigation of his daughter's disappearance. Sound very cliche, right? But although the story itself is familiar, the way it is presented is altogether new. Searching takes place completely through screens. We only see the characters through FaceTime, writing emails, browsing on phones/computers, making phone calls, and texting. This new style of filmmaking, which I believe is called screen-life, was absolutely perfected by Searching. There's something about watching characters interact digitally that brings the story to life; it has the perfect combination of excellent performances by the cast and an innovative approach to cinematography. Minutes into the film, I found myself wrapped up in its events and the characters, theorizing about what could possibly have happened or who was involved. The plot may be a bit common, but there are still some twists and turns that I think many will find shocking. I also think that the score was so subtle and well-integrated that it complimented the flow of the plot and the mindset of the main character. Overall, I found Searching to be a creative and thrilling film that is worth seeing in theaters. If you enjoy crime-dramas or mysteries, this is definitely a must-see.",

I felt thrilled to discover what would happen at the end and, whether or not the outcome would be what I expected. I came up with my theory for the conclusion by putting together the clues from the movie, little by little. It is very entertaining, because the film gives the audience an opportunity to be detectives for a moment and try to solve the very unique mystery in the film. \n\nThe storyline is about a father, David, that enjoys watching his daughter Margot grow up while posting pictures and videos of her to social media, sharing his happiness with his love ones. As Margot enters her teenage years, she starts to grow apart and seem distant from him. One day, she disappears after telling her father that she went to a study group. David looks on the internet to try to find clues about where she may be. Her friends don't seem to know much and don't help either David or the detective that comes on the case to figure out what happened to her and hopefully find her alive. \n\nMy favorite scene is when David starts to get desperate because of Margot's disappearance, leading to him brainstorming ideas about how to find her. This results with him going into Margot's computer to find answers as to whereabouts. This is my favorite scene because it is very meaningful and is the moment he starts to realize, although he doesn't admit it, that he truly does not know his daughter at all. When he opens her laptop, it is as if he is entering unknown territory and we see the distance between him and Margot. He was very close to her, while she was growing up, but as soon as she hit the teenage years, she became a stranger. \n\nThe important message in this film is that better communication between family members is encouraged and will improve the dynamics of the family. For example, in the beginning of the movie, the reason for her disappearance is unknown and that leads to the suspense and mystery of the storyline. But, let's say hypothetically that Margot disappeared on purpose, because she was dealing with a problem and, since she had grown apart from her dad, she didn't feel he could help her. If parents, especially those raising their children alone, communicate and interact better, they can help their kids through the tough times. They ease the process of going through conflicts, so that running away is not their only choice. I recommend this film for ages 13 to 18, as well as adults and I rate it 4.5 out of 5 stars. \n\nReviewed by Alejandra G., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

            "content": "Our modern, tech-heavy, screen-focused world is a dichotomy. The insidious and powerful danger of an internet-dependent world is that it manages to make us both more connected and less connected simultaneously. It provides us with unending knowledge and leisure, but also isolates and exacerbates loneliness. Searching uses its unique storytelling gimmick (everything taking place within the characters' screens) to get this across, all while giving us a solid crime-mystery-thriller that replaces the genre-staples of quick edits and shaky cameras with dramatic clicks-and-drags.\nThe film opens with a powerfully moving, Up-esque montage (where we get to see massive jumps in technology over the past 10 years), before settling into its proper story. Cho plays a widowing father whose daughter suddenly goes missing, and he has only her digital and social media presence to help him find her. With the slowly revealed clues and skin-crawling details, it will certainly tickle the fancy of currently ubiquitous murder-porn addicts. However, director Chaganty's control over tone (especially the moments of welcome comic relief) and Cho's soulful lead turn make this scene-turner shine above lesser, seedier whodunnits.\nSure, there are some less-than-realistic moments that hurt the flow. For one thing, I don't know anyone who uses computers as thoroughly as these people (does anyone actually use the address book on their computer desktop? If so, I doubt they fill in the notes section with details on how they know the person). It also isn't completely immune from the melodrama that can often accompany mystery-tragedies like this. Mostly though, Searching is a heart-pounding, devastating, and undeniably compelling experiment.",

            "content": "Searching is an engrossing film, working with a gimmick that really pays off. Shot only from the perspective of various computer screens, it uses this limitation to it's advantage. The film opens with a touching sequence about the lives of our protagonists filtered through the lens of everything they put into their computer over the years. Photos, videos, appointments. It's a beautiful little montage that is effective at getting you to understand and care about the characters quite quickly. From there John Cho leads the film with a fantastic performance filled with anguish and desperation. Each new clue is intricately woven into everything that has come before, and when Cho discovers something new, the audience feels each fresh revelation with him. The mystery builds and the tension grows to a scene that had me hunched over, leaning forward out of my recliner. \n\nFrom there the movie goes downhill. It ends up feeling like the climax came early. The most engrossing part of this movie happens, and then is resolved, and then we still have several more scenes to unravel the remaining mystery. Nothing that follows lives up to this plot point, and as a result the rest of the movie falls flat, even when it jumps the shark a bit with it's conclusion. I won't spoil the ending, but I thought it was the weakest part of the movie. It feels a little contrived, and I get the feeling that there was initially a much darker ending to the script that was re-worked in the transition to the big screen. It's not an infuriating resolution, and it doesn't ruin the movie, but it is very clunky. So much of the movie gives us information by letting us discover it as Cho does, but the end of the film starts to spoon-feed the audience a little, slowing down to make sure they're keeping up before finally just showing an uncut scene of a character explaining exactly what happened. It's a let down after the smooth storytelling and plotting of the rest of the mystery. They did hint at the final twist ahead of time, leaving a few small clues for the audience, including a sly one snuck in while exploring the wife's computer profile. But where the big crazy twist made me wonder how I had missed it, the final one made me wonder how I could have possibly seen it.  I wish they would have stuck with the darker ending, it would have served the movie much better.",

This movie dives into the depths right out the gate as we are taken on a journey through Margot's young life through the eyes of growing technology around her and we watch the fun of her first days of school as well as the pain in the last days of her mother's life.\n\nThis movie was written and directed by Aneesh Chaganty and he has done a marvelous job with this film. From the beginning to the end, it engages every emotion as you feel sadness, joy, anger, confusion as you desperately want to know what happened to this young girl. John Cho plays Margots father David Kim who slept through 3 phone calls from his daughter to wake up and not see her again. Debra Messing plays Detective Vick, who is investigating the disappearance and working to keep the investigation, the ensuing search and the media coverage under control.\n\nWith the amazing levels of intrigue, confusion, emotions and the incredible way this story is shared, I give this film 4.5 stars. Director Chaganty shows the good, the bad, and the ugly after someone goes missing. This is one movie that I will likely watch again and I recommend this to all parents, if you have teenagers in your life, bring them with you, they won't want to miss this. Was she a runaway or was she abducted, who was responsible, could it have been prevented, what happened and what would you do in that position?

This movie intrigued me because it was a cool concept and they used the point of view of the computer like few movies including Unfriended and The Den. I really liked this movie. It was was a cool mystery and it was interesting the whole time. John Cho as David Kim did such a wonderful job. You could feel real emotion and his frustration. Debra Messing played Detective Vick and she did a good job too. Going back to the whole computer point of view, I thought it worked well for this film. You can see David write what\u2019s on his mind through texts and delete it like how people do every day. It also was a movie that payed rights to use real company names like Google, Facebook, and Apple. Because I thought it was supposed to be a found footage movie, there is a score to it with a nice piece at the beginning. It really bugged me at first but then I realized it wasn\u2019t found footage. It\u2019s just a film with a cool perspective. Now this movie has a big twist at the end that people were talking about and saying how amazing it was. I just must be pretty smart (as I do watch a lot of movies) where I predicted most of the twist. Everyone else in the theater was talking about how they didn\u2019t see it coming but I found it to be a bit predictable so I wasn\u2019t as surprised. There were some parts of the movie where I kind of wished it wasn\u2019t in the perspective of the computer but I was fine how it was going. This is a pretty good thriller movie, one of the better recent ones, and I think people should see it. I drove down to Madison to see it at a theater because it wasn\u2019t playing anywhere near here, but it is coming to theaters around here tomorrow and there were some premiers earlier this night. Go see Searching. You won\u2019t be disappointed. My Grade: A-",

The Asian Dad is likable and you support him as he goes through the mystery of solving on what happened to his missing daughter. The plot takes you on a lot of twist and turns and keeps you engaged on what is going to happen next. By the end, you are fully immersed into the story as to what exactly happened. Finally, they do reveal what happens and it makes you want to go back and rewatch it again from a different prospective.

            "content": "I am here for this type of movie.  So this is about a single father (John Cho).  His 16-year-old daughter (Michelle La) stays late for a study group one night, and he thinks nothing of it... until she doesn't come home the following morning.  The police can only do so much, so he decides to take matters into his own hands: by looking for clues on what may have happened on his daughter's laptop.  Now this is a new subgenre that I have been a big proponent of: the laptop movie.  So far, it is waters that haven't been tamed so to speak, and to my knowledge, it is just this and the Unfriended series leading the wave.  The original trailer to this looked nothing short of superb, so of course I had to check this out opening weekend.  I had high expectations for this, and I was not disappointed with this twisty-turny little detective mystery.  Now this is a movie that hooks you pretty early on, and it does have a large amount to do with the manner that the story is presented on.  Searching utilizes the most popular and recognizable channels of social media, and because of that, it always stay relatable.  It integrates all of the common internet seamlessly, and it is shown just like it would be if you were trying to get something accomplished on a computer.  I appreciated all of the evidence featured here, because they make it make logical sense on how they arrived at each specific point.  With a number of mystery stories, you can sometimes get bogged down  in the details.  Not with Searching.  Because you are on a laptop and you always know exactly what you are supposed to be giving priority attention to, it really gives the narrative a strong boost.  Reveals happen exactly when they are supposed to, you don't outthink the story, and it keeps your focus  on exactly what it is supposed to be on.  Ultimately, it is John Cho's movie, and I think he does a fine job as this determined father, getting to show more range than what is typically asked of him.  I do think the laptop movie is the new bottle movie, and it really invigorates the found footage genre.  This moves very fast with plenty of plot twists to keep you interested.  My complaints are sparse nitpicks, like how it feels the need to punctuate a revelation with an additional browser tab being pulled up, but I guess that is there for the people who are only paying half attention.  Searching is a fresh take on the detective movie, and I give it an enthusiastic recommendation.",

It's the incredibly coy, red-herring-ridden script that really pulls the audience into the circumstances at hand and encourages them to play detective alongside John Cho's \"Henry Kim,\" ultimately keeping them chomping at the bit for more clues as to what went down and what could possibly happen next. This is a really solid thriller with some dynamite twists and turns. And as for that aesthetic, I found it to be about 85% effective. As things get a little too big for the visual premise's proverbial britches, however, that's when I found myself checking out. But, again, this story is what ultimately keeps you in it from moment \"A\" to moment \"Z.\"",

            "content": "There\u2019s been a lot noise about this film, majority being good noise at that. A lot of it praising John Cho\u2019s performance and format of the film itself. So, this really spurred my interest and was looking forward to watching this feature length directorial debut from Aneesh Chaganty. Unfortunately, this may have set my expectations too high as, sadly I wasn\u2019t overly impressed, nor did I think the performances were anything to go by. The only thing that makes this mystery thriller stand out is the format of using the new screen life sub genre of filming everything from what could be an AI spying on/from someone\u2019s electrical devices. I say stand out loosely because it\u2019s not groundbreaking, and essentially uses the same format and expands somewhat on what was originally Unfriended. There\u2019s even a little reference to film here, with both films being produced by Timor Bekmambetov; a man who incidentally pioneered this sub genre and is directing his own screen life film, Profile, scheduled for release later this year. But it steps away from horror and moves into the realm of being a thriller where Cho\u2019s character, David Kim investigates the disappearance of his only daughter, Margot, by essentially hacking into her social media and emails to find, not only clues about her vanishing, but a lot more about herself as a person. I can\u2019t deny the technical brilliance of the film and can appreciate the incredible undertaking of coding this whole film together. In retrospect, filming only took 13 days and then the following 2 years was piecing the film together using a multitude of key/ branded social platforms and computer operating systems. But again, it\u2019s not the first of it\u2019s kind and even the film\u2019s opening immediately reminded me of Alan Becker\u2019s phenomenal Animator vs. Animation videos. But in terms of story, script and performance. I found the film to be very underwhelming. I\u2019m not saying Cho was terrible, but it certainly isn\u2019t the outstanding, believable performance some critics are making it out to be; and could it be the contrast of the shoddy acting from the rest of the cast that actually makes him stand out. Cho\u2019s performance of a clingy father trying to find his daughter isn\u2019t convincing at all; it\u2019s dumbed down and way too rational for a man in his position. As for Messing\u2019s performance as Det. Vick leading the investigation, she came across as too amateurish. I feel there little to no research of parents who have been in similar situations and I dread to think what impact this film would have on them. I think of Sean Penn\u2019s performance in Mystic River, and yes, totally different characters, but you can\u2019t believe Cho out performed or even equalled Penn. As for the story, it\u2019s propped up by obviously plot fillers that make the mystery slightly predictable in places to only then collapse under it all in what appears to be a messy attempt at being clever. It\u2019s not entirely predictable, but the big reveals just make it feel like it\u2019s clutching for a good finish. This, and the synthetic script just makes the film wholly unbelievable whilst still maintaining intrigue. I can appreciate the complexity of the film\u2019s story, and the necessity of these plot fillers to be in place, but unfortunately it gives too much away. There\u2019s so many unanswered questions to unnatural responses or behaviour and I honesty doubt both parent and police would handle the investigation in such a linear, yet clumsy way. In fact, the more I think about it the more issues I find that just don\u2019t add up, and I could already write a list. Basically if it\u2019s suppose to represent human behaviour in such situations, it fails, especially with David Kim\u2019s character. I mean, do people actually FaceTime that much? FaceTime the police? It does pose questions on parenting and who we choose our avatars to be, touching on the risks and dangers of today\u2019s online world; and it certainly displays good examples of how shallow people can be, how the youth culture of today, can have such nonchalant, disrespectful attitudes, having the ability to disconnect from reality at the right click of a mouse; and this is the only thing the film feels realistic about. Trolls do exist people. Apart from the technical proficiency, I also enjoy Torin Borrowdale\u2019s dynamic score that really helped conveyed the mood and setting. However, comparing this film with a score to it\u2019s earlier sibling films like Unfriended, these films managed to convey fear and emotion without a score. Still, it works here and Borrowdale\u2019s composes a nice range of music. It\u2019s a sub genre that is very much still at it\u2019s gimmicky stage and I wonder where it\u2019ll go from here. Maybe the next When Harry Met Sally will be like You Got Mail but be totally screen life format, especially with the ever-growing trend of online romances. But for this, it\u2019s fast becoming the most overrated movie of the year.

Everything is told through a computer screen, especially video chat, newsfeeds, and phone calls.\n\nWhen I saw the trailer to this, I was on the fence. This was basically the same gimmick used for the horror movie Unfriended. I was worried about how much more you can do with the format. Interestingly, these two films are from the same producer. Listened to a podcast interviewing him. He thinks that-first-person films are the wave of the future. Although, I don't know if this can survive long-term, I am so glad this was made. \n\nUnfriended actually proved to be the testing ground for this format. The technique is far more self-assured. Not once did things feel awkward. The opening montage, sort-of-an-equivalent to the opening of Up, is especially well done. The format really focuses on the little things, like how you understand the characters' views from stuff like hovering the cursor over an image or editing a message before they send it or and just miscellaneous comments on social media. \n\nUnlike Unfriended, this film utilizes background music. Fans of cinema verite may feel it pulls away from the experience, but I thought it really helped set the mood.\n\nThe script is really good. The revelations, twists, set up, and pacing are all quite  well-thought out.\n\nActing is fine too. However, it is John Cho who carries the brunt of the film, and he absolutely nails it as a desperate father.\n\nSearching is a finely made mystery and offers something a little different. Highly recommended.",

It is one of the best movies Ive seen this year.\nSearching is an excellent movie that is creatively filmed like no other film youve ever seen.  Much of the film takes place on sites accessed on an electronic device. We watch along as the lead character accesses the sites desperately looking for information that will allow him to find his daughter.  Searching has a number of good twists and turns in the plot. John Cho is excellent as the increasingly desperate father searching for his missing daughter. \nContent concerns include some adult language, including the abuse of Gods name, some violence, and sexual references.  This would be appropriate for age 12 and up.\nRead the entire review at:  httpscoramdeotheblog.com20180901my-review-of-searching",

The twists and the red herrings were very well done. Great attention to detail and it all makes sense in the end without at all being predictable.\n\nSomehow I hadn't even heard of this movie before today. I don't know if the name had anything to do with it, since the name itself doesn't make you as interested. Like while I loved this movie more than the Unfriended movies, those had fitting names for their moves, whereas Searching sounds a bit generic.

The final act......hmmm, it might be too far fetched for some but this will have emotional resonance with some. A cautionary tale that people are not necessarily who they claim to be online (even if this lesson should have been learned circa 1998 let alone 2018) and, more importantly, those little nuggets of information you leave, both online and orffline can be the crucial giveaway.

In this aspect it's strangely effective in evoking emotions. The pivotal part, obviously, is Cho's performance which is more than up to snuff. The icing on the cake I suppose are the few instances of social commentary that are all too relevant regarding online media popularity contests.",

John Cho does a decent job of being that worried father, though sometimes it feels a bit overacted... just a bit. \nWhat's interesting is how much you think you might know a person when you really don't, whether they be people that you know in person or online, but it doesn't preach that lesson to you. It was a well done story and I loved that Cho played a main character and it didn't have to center on racism or racial issues, even though those movies are still needed to get people to learn.

            "content": "\"Searching\" is being heralded as the ushering in as the birth of an exciting new narrative concept, but here's hoping this filmmaking style quickly goes the way of the mumblecore genre. I sit at a computer monitor all day so the last thing I want to do when I escape to the world of cinema is sit and look at a computer screen for an additional two hours. The crime drama, set entirely on computer screens, has enough mysterious twists and turns to keep you mildly engaged but is far from the thriller it could've been.\n\nThere are some legitimately effective scenes that deliver an emotional punch, the best being the beautiful, extended introductory set-up where we learn the family's history from a shared montage of their online activity from their daughter's birth to the death of a wife and mother. It's almost impossible not to be emotionally invested in these characters and feel the agony along with David (John Cho) when he realizes his teenage daughter Margot (Michelle La) has gone missing. David aids a superstar detective (Debra Messing), in a clunky misstep of a performance) in the investigation by poring over Margot's social media accounts to search for answers. The distraught dad slowly realizes how little he actually knew about his daughter.\n\nThe storytelling device of using social media to solve a mystery is moderately engaging at first but quickly turns into a distracting gimmick that becomes stale. The entire film takes place on various electronic devices, from multiple computers to iPhones to hidden surveillance cameras. If watching as someone types a search query into Google is your idea of a good time, then you'll love this movie.\n\nThe most interesting themes aren't amplified enough, like how truly scary it is that random strangers can find out a lot about you from your seemingly innocuous online activity and how most of us share far too many intimate details of our lives on social media without so much as a blink. The film takes a turn for the worst when it abandons all the compelling set ups and tosses them out the window in favor of a preposterous ending, an outrageous final reveal that, and there's no sugar coating it here, is just plain dumb.\n\nAttentive viewers will notice little hints along the way that something's up (check out Margot's high school mascot, for instance), but the ending is altogether off-putting. The film is grossly condescending to its audience too, treating them like morons by hand holding everyone's way through the mystery and the eventual crazy twist.\n\nDirector Aneesh Chaganty for some reason feels the need to over-explain and repetitively state the obvious, from ridiculous news report narration to literally spelling out the big clues that eventually solve the crime. Perhaps he is bowing to average moviegoers who aren't in the business of challenging themselves, but this movie has all the subtleties of a t.v. movie of the week.\n\nA SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW",

People who don't use the internet may not get this film but for those who do - you're going to love this . \n\nThis uses the big screen to condense your vision into the small screen - filmed in a form of first person POV - but you see both sides of the camera - you see what the character sees and and you see the character be it visually or in text form.\n\nThis thriller is what cinema has been waiting for - the next step is the 4th dimension but that's an idea I've been working on so it's not relevant to this review . \n\nLike all good thrillers it's got twists and turns and although you might guess the ending as I did you are still not sure as you're constantly given plausible alternatives . \n\nWhat I loved about the film was the journey as the characters develop so does the operating system , software and hardware making the story very believable - it's definitely a film for the gadget loving social media using cyber generation and its use of live chat is groundbteaking - the film just feels so real - with typos and corrections , deletes all making it so absorbing . Even trolls rear their ugly heads . \n\nThis is a must see for thriller loving tech wizards - this was the perfect film for me . \n\nOverall 9.5/10 but that can easily be rounded up to 10/10 for originality \n\nPad.A 10/10",

Think Open Windows (the closest comparison/absolute trash) and Unfriended (surprisingly effective but not excellent). There are twists in here that just make sense; everything that goes down is believable and relevant, touching on toxic masculinity, grief, \"true crime attention seeking\" (Rick and Morty ref) and a lot more. Again, I feel that some elements are far too pat; this girl has the absolutely perfect home life, is pretty and friendly, but has like zero friends? John Cho is a bit too \"the perfect dad\" for my tastes as well, and same goes for Mom, in the brief time she appears. The ending, again, could have been more toothsome as well. But for those faults, I still highly recommend Searching to just about anyone who likes a good thriller.",

But I saw it today, I knew everything he was doing to find her, and I recognize Windows XP like it was yesterday. \nThis was set in San Jose, not far from me, and refers to locations just south of the city that I could Google while watching the movie. So again, this film might only have passing interest for many, but as a dad with a teenage daughter in the Bay Area who interacts with her on social media, it was absurdly on point, and thus very personally intense.

        },
        {
            "content": "Rubbish plot, but aesthetically well crafted\n\nSearching is a film with two main organisational principles; there's the thriller plot, which ostensibly keeps everything moving, and to which everything else should, in theory, be in service. Then there's the aesthetic design, with the entire film taking place online, the images presented taking the form of what is seen on computer screens, iPhones, security cameras etc. One of these principles is exceptionally well handled, the other isn't, and it shouldn't take a genius to guess which is which.\n\nWritten by Aneesh Chaganty and Sev Ohanian, and directed by Chaganty, the film tells the story of Margot Kim (Michelle La) and her father, David (John Cho). Margot's mother Pamela (Sara Sohn) died several years previously, and Margot has since drifted apart from David, although he doesn't seem to have noticed. When Margot doesn't return home from a study group, David learns she cancelled her piano lessons six months prior, and the money he had been giving her for those lessons was instead being deposited into her bank account. Several weeks ago, the entirety was transferred to a now deactivated Venmo account. David reports her missing, with the case assigned to Det. Rosemary Vick (Debra Messing). However, as David and Vick begin to delve deeper into Margot's life, every investigative avenue seems to throw up another mystery, and as time passes, it begins to look more and more as if Margot has simply run away.\n\nThe mise en scene of Searching is much more successful than the plot, with almost the entire film taking place on a computer screen, with Facetime conversations, iPhone messages, security camera footage, and TV material rounding out the design. The aesthetic is extremely well crafted; from Chaganty's direction to Juan Sebastian Baron's cinematography, to Nicholas D. Johnson and Will Merrick's editing; logistically, this can't have been an easy film to plan or shoot, and the fact that the various components that go into making up the final image all work so well together suggests a great degree of care.\n\nWithin this, the filmmakers are even able to throw up a few surprises. For example, the structure grants us more access to David's interiority than would be possible in a regular film; on several occasions, David is shown typing something during a conversation, only to delete it, and send something completely different. Anyone who has spent any amount of time talking online or via text will be familiar with this, and the use of it in the film allows us a glance into his psyche, showing us where his mind is in an unfiltered sense, before self-censorship kicks in. It only happens a few times (if it happened too much, it would become meaningless), but it really does impart a degree of psychological verisimilitude.\n\nChaganty himself is a former Google Creative Lab employee, so he would know a thing or two about issues such as the uses and over-uses of technology, the unpleasant side of online culture, and the notion of digital footprints, and it is these areas where most of the film's more salient points are concentrated. For example, the addiction to technology and social media so prevalent in today's culture is right there in the set-up - the entire Kim family are obsessed with speaking to one another via phones and computers, and recording pretty much everything. Another subject is the toxicity of the internet, the prevalence of online troll culture, and the tendency for people to say things online that they never would in person, believing that the anonymity afforded by the internet gives them the right to be unpleasant. This is communicated primarily through one scene - after watching a news report about Margot on YouTube, David begins reading the comments, which almost immediately start making jokes about him having killed her, and being \"father of the year\".\n\nThe impossibility of ever being invisible online is another topic. Yes, the film is about a person who had an entire online existence that no one knew about, but that was only because no one had looked. Once someone did, and once a few threads were pulled, everything is exposed, as the impossibility of erasing ones digital footprint becomes central to the story. Anyone who has spent any amount of time online will be familiar with many of these issues, and the fact that they all ring so true, without the film becoming preachy, is a testament to the quality of the film-making.\n\nFinally, and this cannot be overemphasised, the film includes a pitch-perfect, perfectly timed, perfectly delivered Justin Bieber joke that is absolutely hilarious, and has to be seen to be appreciated.",
