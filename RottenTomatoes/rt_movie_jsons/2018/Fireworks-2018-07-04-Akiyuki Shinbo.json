            "content": "Astonishing realism in teenage relationships.\n\nAkiyuki Shinbo and Nobuyuki Takeuchi's direction for their romance drama anime picture Fireworks (2017) is dreamy and enchanting. They keep all the drama on a grounded level of teenage worries about relationships, dating, friendship, and concerns for tomorrow. Their visual ideas for directing time shifting back into the past for an alternate existence is creative and cool. I adore when anime movies feel sincere in how they approach depicting teens in a coming of age story. Characters feel this freedom to do whatever, but I like how Shinbo and Takeuchi's direction has them hesitate when faced with making hard choices. It feels all the more authentic to me. Fireworks is a wonderful anime feature that I'll remember fondly.\n\nFurthermore, Fireworks' vivid colors for fireworks, outfits, and hair are as breathtaking as the stunning background paintings. Toho's hand drawn animation is truly gorgeous and as impressive as other modern anime films like Your Name or The Wind Rises. Everything is explosive in Fireworks, from strained friendships to sudden relationships developing, but Shinbo and Takeuchi's direction ensures there's this quiet fun to appreciate all the simple pleasures in life's every waking moment.\n\nShunji Iwai and Hitoshi One's script writing is beautifully sympathetic to the anxieties of kids with realistic dialogue to how teenagers think, talk, and feel. You better understand and relate to feelings of butterflies in your stomach over a crush speaking to you or asking you out, while empathizing with single friends jealous of your love life. Fireworks understands the loving feeling you get when someone you love is near and counting on you. I think it's a lovely anime feature.\n\nFireworks is a moving romance drama and a playful science-fiction adventure. I know some viewers disliked the ambiguous ending, but liked how it concludes on a warm, positive note of ethereal romance and simple closeness of a couple. What happens after this curious \"What If?\" style story of potential romantic encounters is up to you. \n\nThese mind bending stories work best when grounded to some kind of reality and Fireworks does that well by editor Rie Matsuhara easily cutting back to certain past events, while splicing together previous scenes quickly in a montage, so that the audience can follow along clearly. Rie's cuts keep Fireworks edited down to a brisk 90 minutes. I love short stories and I feel like anime narratives can be told effectively with sharp cuts like in Fireworks.\n\nSatoru Kosaki's score is beautifully composed. The J-Pop idol song in the middle of Fireworks is really cute and well written. The rest of Kosaki's score is sublime with this magically romantic orchestration that charms you immediately. All the voice actors and actresses have a playful excitement that comes across as endearing and memorable. Lastly, I really liked the strange sound design choices from Youta Tsuruoka. The crystal time marble changing time with this glistening sound or the splashes of water all sound neat in Fireworks, let alone the fireworks explosions themselves.\n\nIn all, Fireworks is worth seeing. I think Fireworks is a fantastic romance drama for lovers and the lonely to experience.",

            "content": "2017 was such great year. Sadly, Fireworks didn't embody any of it. One of my biggest issues in story telling is when real world issues are solved by fictional things. Okay so the oversexualized child has a hard time at home, let's just reverse time and fix it. A relatable issue with a solution that isn't possible. Sadly the best scene in the film is when the main character (I can't bring myself to remember anyone's name) gets punched. I showed this to a group of my friends and it made them all laugh. Given that it was supposed to be a tragic scene, I knew at that point we had a real stinker here. *sigh* not even the animation is that great, at least not for 2017 standards. Man it's the best part of the movie and that's no better than a 3/5. My God I hate this movie.",

From what I saw the trailer and music video made this film seem promising. What I watched was trash.\n\nThe animation is terrible with very cheap CGI. It's so obvious if something isn't drawn. The worst are the cars, windmills, and fireworks. They shouldn't have bothered spending money on CGI if it was going to be that poorly rendered. \n\nThe basic plot becomes missing half way through the film, and ends with a huge \"you decide what happens.\" The characters are awful. They lack any real agency or even a basic personality. The worst is Norimichi Shimada (the main character) who if I had to describe is essentially air. \n\nLater when I think Nazuna Oikawa's has a real concern about opposing her mother's new boyfriend, they completely drop that part of the story and move on. \n\nThen there's the notorious acid dream like sequence that comes out of nowhere are provides nothing to the film. The monotone singing really takes the cake.\n\nHonestly, I can tell you I watched something, but if I had to describe what I watched, I would be unable to due to the confusion of what this movie is suppose to be.\n\nDo not watch.",

The movie had lots of potential tbh, it's story had a good base concept if done correctly and with a couple of tweaks.

            "content": "Uchiage Hanabi Break Down\nBy the way, this movie seems to be different from the original by a long shot and be careful for spoilers.\n- [ ] Nazuna possibly has thrown the ball to travel through time as possibly hinted from the beginning of the show when she writes a letter after she finds the ball. Although this isn't proven, it's good to keep note.\n- [ ] Very pointless/lifeless in a way as a problem in terms of character development for this movie. But the philosophy it's trying to teach is the main goal of this anime.\n- [ ] It all seems pointless, but as the review goes there are some hints in the detailed world that drive the meaning of the anime (they have to be major actions in this limited and interesting perspective but detailed animation)\n- [ ] First they start out with 4 important characters: Norimichi, Nazuna, Nazuna's mother, and Yusuke. Others most likely irrelevant. All of them are underdeveloped but at least the important 4 had some development.\n- [ ] The first signs of detail is when she first talks to Norimichi, about catching the dragonfly, most likely her. But he misses it, hinting that he missed his opportunity, basically foreshadowing the whole story from this point. When he missed his opportunity to go out with her on the last day and confess his feelings, or just missed opportunities in which he could have saved Nazuna.\n- [ ] First the fifty meter race seems to define the outcome of possibilities of the whole thing. Which the guy was mad in all of the other possibilities from the ball. At first the Yusuke says that he doesn't like Nazuna, yet he gets mad and jealous after Norimichi takes her from him. Which seems to be bounded by the 50 meter race that in the real world, the precedent was held.\n- [ ] Then comes the fireworks in which it was flat. They were all sure at first that it was round in which the real world it should be, but it was flat as depicted in the movie. This symbolizes that not everything is how it seems, just like Nazuna and Yusuke. Yusuke showed his jealousy or put on a fake face on the first trial causing pain to the real world. This show the real world and how little in the real world care until the last minute. But that one time, they asked one important question, \"If [fireworks] were flat, what would you do?\" As that is yet to be answered, it seems to show...\n- [ ] Then comes the second chance in which Norimichi goes back to fight the father, but that time he gets his way and he gets to have fun with her, says that \"This world is wrong. Fireworks can't be seen like this.\" That just shows that this version of the world is too good to be true, as shown that the type of fireworks is round, but they're extra blurry and fancy. That is when reality hits hard and they get killed. Throughout the story in the train station/ride with Nazuna, they talk about dying together, in love. Nazuna lost his opportunity to throw the ball and they fell into the ocean. \n- [ ] The next thing that pops up is the train, but is actually the road to an imaginary world. It's a train ride to death (to an endless path with no direction, which the sign says \"umi\" or the ocean), like afterlife as hinted after their death where nobody can see them, as Norimichi said, \"what if no one saw us?\" Which no one did. The world created seemed to be inside the ball. With things frozen, except for the fact that some people can move. Moreover, in the end, when they call Norimichi's name and he doesn't respond, it hints that he's dead showing Yusuke's unresponsive face, also hinting that this is the real world, while the ball provided a world that the ball created, as it has created many other worlds after.\n- [ ] When Nazuna jumped into the water, and popped it, it signified that she was a firework, as water droplets. And when the firework ball was shot up into the world, it showed what it look likes memories, but I believe it's not. It's the opportunities of Norimichi, that was the special powers of the ball, a ball of opportunity, dreams, wishes, timelines. That's why it changes the world with every throw and wish of Norimichi. And that fake imaginary world in response to the question, \"What happens after you die?\" Reveals a possible world, possible outcome hidden inside the opportunity of the ball. This story talks about the mistakes of a person and all of the opportunities that he could have taken which lead to better outcomes. But the world isn't real, as hinted when it became too good to be true, when he cheated the system by going back in time and modifying it, and by knowing the outcomes of each timeline. This symbolizes the author's story, he wishes to take the opportunities to change the outcome through a butterfly effect, but reality prevents that from happening; However, \"what if...\" the world isn't what it seems, maybe it would be possible?\n- [ ] This whole movie was focused on reality development, not exactly character development. It was like a cat and mouse chase of a runaway couple that the world forbids together - through fate. This is a lot like Romeo and Juliet's youthful love and immature infatuation of each other, signifying romance while focusing on reality development. However, without the character development, it's hard for the Romance to be romantic especially without good character actions. Because of all these layers, the lack of development, and different focus of the anime, people won't understand this and won't feel much emotion with this without understanding every single detail of the movie. That's is the point of the title: is the movie pointless? too good to be true? or is there more than meets the eye? This plays with our perception so much that many people won't see this as art, but as you can see, if you think about it long enough, you'll understand how this movie is a smart type of art, but failed to entertain as a general story.",
