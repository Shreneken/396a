I found myself completely engaged with the story and it felt like I was watching real events unfold and never a movie. The two young boys in this movie are on-screen magic and their performances are something that is remarkable. The movie has so many unpleasant things happening, there's never any real time to process any of it and it can make the movie a bit draining. Nonetheless, it is an engrossing drama that is expertly made and is worth experiencing because of how honest and eye-opening it feels. Overall, it's a movie made with purpose and a skillfully made one full of moments that will stick with me for a long time.",

            "content": "Misery porn doesn't automatically make for good drama, and Capernaum is proof positive of that sentiment; the film often features excellent cinematography and an exceptionally good performance from child actor Zain Al Rafeea (as protagonist Zain), but is a mix of sincere, simple conflicts and laughably heavy-handed and unrealistic melodrama. Perhaps the best representation of this is a framing device where Zain literally takes his parents to court in an attempt to prevent them from having kids, where all the attendees are dumbfounded by the supposedly profound nature of his statements as if Frank Capra was brought on to tack on an ending to this screenplay. The events of the film are tragic, yes, but there isn't much in the way of context or theme to them, everything is just to provide another layer of struggle for our poor protagonist to contend with. Except juvenile prison, weirdly enough. It's sort of glossed over (like a lot in this film that probably should have been explored more), but once there Zain sort of gets taken in by an Artful Dodger-esque crowd without any sort of fanfare. It's Al Rafeea that really saves a lot of this film, delivering actual sincerity where Capernaum could have easily slid into being a very nicely framed arthouse melodrama alone. (2.5/5)",

            "content": "For this assignment I chose to write the film review on the movie we watched in class, Capernaum. This movie talks about the story of a Lebanese young boy who escapes from his careless parents. As the movie develops, it narrates how Zain, the young Lebanese boy, is able to survive on his own. He meets an Ethiopian refugee family, and as the mother gets caught, he took the role of a parent for the baby refugee, Yonas. Throughout the movie, viewers can see the horrible conditions these people live in and how mistreated and abused poor children are. This movie depicts many violations of human rights as it unfolds the conditions families in poverty live in. \n\n\tSince the beginning of the film, viewers can start to notice the inhumane conditions characters in this movie live in. One of the many sisters Zayn has, Sahar, gets her period at the beginning of the movie. When Zayn realizes what will happen to Sahar when their parents notice that she got her period, he does everything in his power to help her hide it as much time as she can. He was trying to help his sister cover this since he knew once their parents notice it, she would be sent off to marry the shop owner that sent her free food once in a while. After his sister is sent off to marry the shop owner, Zayn vanishes to the streets, and this is when he finds the caring Ethiopian woman. He now starts taking care of the baby as his mother goes out to work. When the baby's mother gets sent off to prison, Zayn takes responsibility of taking care of baby Yonas. When Zayn realizes he can no longer take good care of baby Yonas, he gives him away to a human trafficker in exchange of him going off to another country and starting a new life. But for this, he needs his papers or some sort of identification. He decides to go back to his neglect household in order to get the documentation he needs to go off to another country. When he gets to his house, he realizes that his sister Sahar, is no longer alive. He gets carried away by his anger and stabs the shop owner, which gets him sent off to jail. In jail, he reunites with Yonas' mother, which makes her realize that Yonas got handed to the human trafficker. \n\n\tThis film portrays the reality of refugee children, poverty, and violated rights. It creates consciousness about the current refugee problem in Lebanon. There are around half a million refugee children in Lebanon. Currently, there are many organizations looking to solve this problem. They have successfully managed to open schools in order to offer free education for school-aged Syrian refugee children in Lebanon. They are now working on regain these projects since the coronavirus pandemic slowed the pace of their plans. The pandemic has interrupted the refugee children education in Lebanon and has affected the school openings. Humanitarian groups continue to work to provide better life conditions to these children. Even though some have managed to provide them with free education, many of them are still not able to attend classes because their families can not afford transportation. \n\n\tIn conclusion, the movie Capernaum depicts the effects violation of human rights have on refugee children that live in extreme poverty. Portraying these kids lives' challenges makes viewers realize the seriousness of the refugee problem in the world fast it is growing. Even though there are currently many donor organizations that work hard to minimize the refugee current problem, there is still a lot of work that can be done. In my opinion, producing a movie of the inhumane ways many people around the world live in, and how horrifying the effects are on their lives, is a great way to create awareness about the world's refugee crisis",

            "content": "This movie really opened my eyes. While showing very treacherous living and working conditions while following the life of a 12-year-old Zain, it also shows the very real situation happening in Lebanon. When Zain appears in court many times, we see that he is in fact the plaintiff and is wanting to sue his parents. When asked why, he responds \"Because I was born.\" While living with his neglecting parents and many siblings, at times Zain has to choose between being a kid and working long shifts on the streets to support his large family. The actress and director Nadine Labaki says \"How did we get to the point where we deprived a child of the most basic right, to close his eyes and sleep. This movie depicts child and human trafficking, the struggle and fear the undocumented population goes through every day, and the unknown struggle young children are put through in these slums. Zain even takes over the role of a caretaker when Rahil goes missing and he takes care of her daughter until he no longer can. \nThe population of Lebanon, where the story is set, relies on commerce and trade; and Lebanon's foreign policy had been thoroughly influenced by Syria until 2005. In the movie, Zain is approached by a young Syrian girl who is selling boxes on the street. The girl told him about how she and her family received food, which was provided by a \"food bank\" for Syrian refugees. Zain pretends to be Syrian in order to get food and baby formula for him and the baby. Lebanon has many diplomatic relations with countries all over the world. Syrian refugees in Lebanon face many problems, including debt. Lebanon is already in a financial crisis, mainly due to the pandemic and the blast at the Port of Beirut. The poverty rates are rising every year. While the middle class is becoming poor, the poor are becoming extremely poor. The Lebanese government estimates around 1.5 million Syrian refugees as of 2020. Worsening economic and political instability has forced many people out of their countries and towards Lebanon. However, Lebanon is working with important international organizations such as Anera in order to help the refugees find places to live. \nIn one scene, we see Rhail sitting with a queer couple - a transgender woman who sells snacks and a parking attendant who wears a spiderman costume and calls himself \"cockroach man\". The gender rights in Lebanon are not as progressive as they are in the United States, but the LGBTQ community is more free in  Lebanon than they are in other parts of the Arab world. There is a Penal Code that \"prohibits having sexual relations that are \"contradicting the laws of nature\", which is punishable by up to a year in prison\". In 2016, the Court of Appeals of Beirut stated that a transgender man is allowed to change his official identification after undergoing sex reassignment surgery. \nCapernaum does not have a specific theme besides exposing the reality of the lives of these people. We see corruption, racism, and moral dilemmas that Zain goes through, including the adults that are to blame for his poor way of life: his parents.\nThis is a neo-realistic drama and the way it is shot is almost documentary-like. It is very captivating and closely connects you to the characters to make you feel compassion towards them as they are suffering. \nI definitely recommend watching this movie. As I said at the beginning it is very eye opening and made me want to learn more about the current political situation of Lebanon and maybe find out how I can help.",

            "content": "In the movie Capernaum there are a handful of examples of international relation theories.  In general the movie is about a boy named Zain who runs away from his abusive family, who sell their children away. He runs away to another town where he meets Tigest, a refugee from Ethiopia who is illegally living in the country with her illegal son, Yousen. He spends his time with them until Tigest suddenly doesn't come home one day and Zain is left with not many options. Overall in the movie there are many examples of international relation theories being relayed in the movie deal with human rights, human trafficking and issues with refugees and migration.\n\tZain's family raises their children with no documents, and gives them away in exchange for goods and money. The kids are forced to work and give the money to their parents. Zain tries to run away with his sister Sahra, but when he returns to the house she was being sent off to get married to some 30 year old, when she was just 11-years old. Zain fought for her to stay with him but his parents quickly separated the two and sent Sahra off with her future husband. Basically the parents are creating a human trafficking ring with there kids, they raise them until they are a suitable age and the trade them away. They have tons of children over and over and continue the process. They make sure to not have any documents of their children, meaning all their children don't have birth certificates, and are technically all illegally living in the country as well. Also meaning that the certain age of their children is unknown. \n\tAnother example of human trafficking in the movie is when Tigest is trying to gather enough money to pay the man to make her the forged ID. The man making her ID said he would drop all the charges if she just handed over her son to him. Saying that he will be sold to a loving family who can provide even more for him. Obviously, Tigest did not like that option and quickly turned it down without a second thought. But later on when Tigest is placed in jail as she waits to get deported back to her home country Zain is left to take care of Younus, Tigest's son. He is fine with taking care of him for a while, and they manage to make some money to buy stuff for them to live by selling things on the side of the street. After they get kicked out of their home it becomes very hard for Zain to take care of such a young child, and Yousen was starving as well. Zain had to do what was best for him, to give Yousen to the man so he could be placed in a better family, who can provide him with food and other necessities. Zain only did this because it was his last option, he never liked the idea but he had nowhere to go, no money, and wanted to start fresh, somewhere away from his family. Later on Yousen gets reunited with his mother and they get to spend the rest of their days together, but the fact that people have to give up their children in order for money and good to survive is ridiculous. They \n\tIn the movie there are many issues of human rights. Children at the young ages of 12 are forced to work on the streets selling products to people passing by. Children should be attending school and not sent off around town to work for their parents, not only does making them work put them in a dangerous situation but it causes them to \"grow up\" quicker. When I say that I mean they can be children no more, they are being forced to stand by the side of the street all day in order that their parents can buy food for them. They don't get much of a choice, because if they dont they are parents will most likely get rid of them. The government should create laws that prevent child labor, with penantlites against the parents for putting their children in that situation. This would help significantly reduce the number of children working on the streets selling goods. With harsh laws in place, nobody would put themselves at risk for such harsh penalties. \n\tThe movie Capernaum has many examples of refugees and migration issues. The most prominent example would be when Tigest cannot afford to get her ID forged. She was already living in the country illegally but her current fake documents were about to expire. She was trying to save enough money to get it fixed and renewed but the man would not lower the price. The only exception he would make was if she was to give her son up to him so he could sell him. Tigest obviously did not want to do that and didn't even think twice because her son was everything to her. The fact that Tigest had to find someone to forge her documents so that she wouldn't get deported is very frightening to think about. She eventually got caught with her expired fake ID card and was shoved into prison along with all the other refugees that had migrated here. There they wait until they are deported, but from the beginning it shouldn't have been so hard for Tigest to get a real ID from the country. If the country makes it so hard to gain citizenship then the only option left is to forge the ID. If they were to just create an easier process of gaining citizenship then they wouldn't have to be deporting and walking around checking as many IDs as they have to do currently. \n\tOverall, Capernaum has many great examples of human trafficking, human rights and refugees and migrartion. They portray the issues very well and the relation to the international theories are very prominent in the movie. They live in a very poor country and do many things to try to get by. All the issues in the country grow on each other, human right issues leads to human trafficking and issues with refugees and migration. Just by solving one of them the other two would decrease as well.",

Throughout the film, Zain and numerous people around him face multiple issues. Many human rights violations and problems are seen such as modern slavery, human trafficking, living unregistered, and child labor.\n\tLooking through a liberal perspective of international relations, there have been many issues of human rights violations in this film. During the film, Zains sister Sahar gets her period. This worries Zain and he tells her to hide it so that their parents won't sell her to Asaad who is a convenience store owner. Soon after, Zain enters his home to see chickens in the room and realizes that his parents were trading his eleven-year-old sister Sahar for some chickens. While Sahar was still a child, she was married off to a man because her family could not afford to live. This is human trafficking and modern slavery. Marrying off a child is a clear violation of human rights. People have the right of freedom from slavery. Sahar did not want to marry this man and she was forced to by her parents. This angered Zain and he left on a bus. Looking through a gender lens, woman clearly do not have the same rights and opportunities as men. Sahara was sold off into modern day slavery by being human trafficked.  Through a feminist perspective, this is clear inequality. The boys were not getting married off at a certain age. When Sahara got her period, it raised major concern from Zain because he knew she would be at danger from this. Forced child marriage is extremely unfair and harmful to a child. This ultimately led to Sahara's death because she got pregnant and could not carry a baby at 11 years old.\nWhile on the bus, Zain sees a man dressed up as spider man. This excites him because he was only twelve years old and still a child. The says that he is Spiderman's cousin. I liked that this was included in the film. It showed that Zain is still a kid despite the hardships he was going through. Zain decides to get off at the same stop as the man does and it turns out to be an amusement park. Now being homeless, Zain decides to ask for a job because he needs to support himself. The owner turns him down, but he meets a woman named Rahil. Rahil takes Zain home with him and supports him, and in return Zain watched her baby while she was working. Rahil was a refugee from Syria. She had to leave Ethiopia because she got pregnant out of wedlock. She was afraid that the police would deport her and take away her baby. This is another violation of human rights and gender inequality. From a feminist perspective, Rahil should have the right to have a child without having the fear of being deported. Rahil feared that her baby would be taken into custody when she was born so she had no choice but to leave the country. Pregnancy is a natural occurrence. Woman should not be at fear of losing their child just because they had it out of wedlock. From a liberal perspective, pregnancy should not be punished as this would be a clear violation of human rights as everyone has the right to life and liberty.\nDue to having no papers, Rahil has forged documents to be able to work. When Zain meets her, her documents are about to expire. Rahil goes to a man names Asporo, who had forged her documents the last time to get new ones. Rahil could not afford the new documents. Asporo told her to either pay or give up her child to him and get the documents for free. Rahil then goes to her job to get her money that she worked for, and they did not have it. The manager tells her that he is already risking a lot because she is illegal, so he won't give her the money. From a liberal perspective, this is a violation of human rights. Working for free, or not being given access to the money you have earned when you need it is modern-day slavery. Rahil not getting the money she earned caused her to not be able to get the papers that she needed. Rahil's papers expired and she was arrested by the Lebanese government for being an illegal immigrant, leaving Zain and her child alone. All people have the right to work so punishing Rahil for not having working papers could be a violation of her human rights from a liberal perspective.\nZain and Rahil's son were left without food and water for days. At one point, they were so desperate that they ate ice and sugar. Zain met a young girl named Maysoun working when he went to see Asporo to try and find Rahil. She told Zain that Aspro was sending her to Sweden and that he could do the same for Zain. Aspro tells Zain that he can get him out of the country but that he needs money, or he can give Aspro Rahil's child. Zain then starts selling tramadol on the street in shot form for money. He gets a good amount of money from this and keeps it in the house. When he goes back to the house one day it is locked due to Rahil not paying rent. Zains' money is inside, and he is now not able to get it. This means that Zain had no way out. He had to give Asporo the child. He goes back to Aspros stand and reluctantly gives him the child. At the end of the film, we find out that Rahil's child was locked away in a warehouse with hundreds of other people. These people were likely being human trafficked and sold into modern slavery which clearly is another human rights violation. It was extremely shocking to me that all these people from various backgrounds, some being extremely young like Rahil's child, were all being locked away and sold.\nAfter Zain gives Aspro the child, Aspro tells him that he needs a form of identification. Zain decides to go back to his home and look for his papers. When he goes home, he gets a rude awakening, that he doesn't have any papers, and neither does his entire family. His dad then shows him a hospital bill. His mom tells him that Sahar (his sister who was married off) died. Zain then goes off the rails and stabs Asaad (Sahar's husband). In later court we find out that Sahara was pregnant at eleven years old and bled out on the hospital floor because they wouldn't treat her. All because she didn't have papers.\nClearly, many people in the world are living undocumented with no papers. This causes many problems and leads to human rights violations. People have the right to life, not treating a patient due to them not being registered as a person is a clear violation. People need access to healthcare when they are dying no matter if they have an ID or not. Living without papers also causes another problem. Rahil was unable to work because the was not registered as a person. You need a form of identification to work, and Rahil did not have any. She ended up in jail for having fake, expired documents. She could not get real ones because she did not have any form of ID. It was not Rahil's fault that she was not registered when she was born. This is a clear violation of her right to work.\nThroughout the film there were numerous instances of child labor. This is unacceptable and illegal. Children should not be forced to work because their parents cannot afford for them to live. There were many times where Zain, and other people his age had to work in order to survive. These people are still children and work can cause injury and harm their mental health.\nCapernaum is a great film that talks about various issues that are going on throughout the world. This film has opened my eyes to many issues that I would not have been aware of in the past. I did not know that many people are born unregistered, and about the hardships they face. I also did not know about how common human trafficking still is today and how many children must work on order to help support their families. Capernaum was very shocking and really changed my view on the world, and I highly recommend watching it.",

The queasy themes and fates of the individual characters of this drama will leave no one indifferent. Most of the cast are non-professional actors, which turned out to be a good decision, especially in the case of a Zain Al Rafeea, a Syrian refugee playing the title role.

            "content": "I've watched this movie five times or more. I really liked it. The film focuses on the life of a boy, Zane, who lives in a Beirut slum. Movies are very fascinating and sad.\nIn \"Capernaum\" they did not shoot professional actors, but people from the street in the literal sense \u2013 they were selected there. Shooting on the streets of Lebanon \u2013 \"talking\" nature, poverty, grayness. All this makes what is happening so real and authentic that the film looks like a documentary.\n\nThe main character Zane is a boy from a poor family, without documents, without a childhood, without a future. The theme is not new, familiar to us from\" children of the dungeon \" Korolenko. But here the naturalness, sincerity of the \"actors\" is striking, you don't doubt for a minute that this is how real people live. No theatrics. Everyday dramas and tragedies are told casually, without pathos. And this only reinforces the impression. \nZane, who is about 12 years old, works, takes care of the younger children in the family, does not really eat, does not study. Somehow copes with everything, tries to protect her sister from the arbitrariness of her own parents. But the parents give a 10-year-old girl in marriage, but she will die from an early pregnancy. In Iran and Afghanistan, girls are married at the age of 10. And the worst thing is that most girls die from it. This masculine quality of the defender is also evident when he has to take care of someone else's child, the son of a former prostitute trying to survive in a foreign country. It's amazing that in the most dead-end situation, Zane is essentially a child, looking for a way out, acting, fighting. He is honest and straightforward. He sues his parents for giving birth to him for such a life, considering it irresponsible. Another detail and character trait of the hero: faith in justice. \nDespite the fact that he has seen a lot in his life, he still believes that the court will judge everything and correct mistakes. In the film, you can see a very difficult life of people who live in a country that is fighting without restrictions. We must stop the war so that our children do not cry and live a decent life.\n The film is like a very heavy drama, which is not something that makes you think about life, but rather evokes a sense of compassion for people like us. The plot has its own message, which lies on the surface. The film reveals the problem of poverty, corrupt people, hunger, family, marriage, and so on. \"Capernaum\" tells us about all the worst aspects of the above problems and nothing more. Everyone makes conclusions for themselves personally, there is no specific message, except that the message is that you need to love and appreciate what you have. \nThe film really deserves to be seen, but the film is clearly designed for one time. But you will not regret watching it, because everything was shot very well, despite all the conditions in which this film was created. And the fact of two awards at the Cannes film festival speaks volumes. By the way the film gets a lot of the best comments",

            "content": "Nadine Labaki's \"Capernaum\" is a bleak, hard-hitting and deeply moving film that sheds light on the child refugee crisis in Lebanon. With her latest feature, writer/director Nadine Labaki has crafted a powerful film about impoverished children in Lebanon. It is not easy to recreate the harsh conditions of a poverty-stricken country, but Labaki pulls it off seamlessly. Using haunting cinematography, she draws viewers into the plight of a impoverished child living in Lebanon. From lingering close-ups to stunning establishing shots, the cinematography immerses viewers into the poverty-stricken country. In terms of acting, Labaki draws excellent performances from her relatively newcomer cast. Zain Al Rafeea delivers a dazzling debut performance in the role of a child that sues his parents for neglect. With heartbreaking expressions, he captures the plight of a poor boy that is neglected by his parents. It's one of the most authentic child performances that you'll ever see in a movie. Although \"Capernaum\" is undeniably unforgettable, ultimately it is not a film without flaws. At a little over two hours, it is slightly long and suffers from a lengthy running-time. There are times during the mid-section that it starts to drag and test the viewer's patience. Nevertheless, fans of foreign films will definitely enjoy \"Capernaum\" and so will movie-goers seeking meaningful entertainment. At a time when Arabic Cinema is rarely recognized in Hollywood, it's a timely reminder that the stories of Lebanese children are worth telling on the big-screen.",

I like to know ASAP where a movie takes place, so I had to google it to find out it's Beirut, but Capernaum could've been shot in the slums of many Levantine, North African, or Middle Eastern cities. Unlike most movies that proudly display the landmarks of the city or country therein, we do not get any shots of ancient ruins or the modern skyline, gorgeous churches or mosques, (Beirut is considered the \"Paris of the Middle East\" after all). Instead we get the slums, jails, and the courtroom. Much of the camerawork were close ups and \"shaky cam\" that gave much of the movie a claustrophobic feel to it. Can we talk about Zain (Zain Al Rafeea), the litigious 12 year old who stole the show \u2014 not sure if accurate because he was the protagonist, but my point is that he was phenomenal. He might be the best child actor I've ever seen, I'm not exaggerating here. And I mean \"actor\" as in he appeared in a movie, because Zain Al Rafeea apparently has had 0 training and comes from a Syrian refugee family. Unlike most child actors, who seem to need an adult counterpart to carry the plot, Zain must've been in 95% of the scenes, oftentimes on his own. In a film that is so ugly in so many ways, the beauty comes from the characters themselves \u2014 the smile of a child, the tears streaming down the cheeks of a mother reunited with her infant son. You have to see this one. Turn on the subtitles. This was nicest surprise I've had in a while when picking a movie.",

For me, however, this film never fully worked because the editing felt extremely haphazard, and at times even Labaki's direction, because the movie to me was essentially a bunch of heartbreaking moments (each rather separate of each other) thrown at you one after another to make you cry. Sure, it succeeds very much in the crying aspect.

While Zain, the main character in this film had his fair share of annoying moments, he overall did a good job conveying the story.\n\nThere are several things I would've changed about the film but as a whole I enjoyed it. I truly believe that this is the strongest year for foreign films in a long time!\n\nThe story was interesting, and it was easy to watch. It's not ground breaking and likely most will never know its name (outside of select groups). I particularly enjoyed how caring Zain was in the film, it's hard to pretend the emotions he flooded the screen with.\n\nAs most of you I gave Cold War and Roma less than stellar reviews.

Zain Al Rafeea gives an incredible first time performance as we resonate with his characters dire circumstances and tough living, while he still keeps that childish vulnerability that can't be helped at such a young age. A harrowing, heart wrenching, brilliant film.",

            "content": "I wouldn't call it entertaining per se, but it's certainly provocative \n\nTaking as its subject the horrific plight of guttersnipe children in the slums of Beirut, Capharnaum (the word means \"a place marked by a disorderly accumulation of objects\") is the kind of film of which a superficial reading might suggest miserablism at best, and \"poverty porn\" at worst. The third film from Lebanese writer/actress/director Nadine Labaki, the film is written by Labaki, Michelle Keserwany, and Jihad Hojeily and presents a milieu in which people are discardable, children are bought and sold for a few chickens; 11-year-old girls are married off so their family can pay the rent; babies are fed on ice cubes covered in sugar; refugees roam the streets; mental illness goes untreated; people without a Lebanese identity card don't officially exist. The film works because it never feels like it's exploiting, patronising, or trivialising the poverty it depicts, never attempting to manipulate the audience into feeling a preconceived emotion. On the contrary, it's notable for just how unsentimental it is. However, it's also deeply humanist, with compassion in its DNA and a quiet rage at its core.\n\nTelling the story of Zain El Hajj (Zain Al Rafeea), a young boy from the slums who sues his parents for bringing him into the world, the film then flashes back several months, showing Zain running away from home after failing to prevent his parents selling his beloved 11-year-old sister Sahar (Haita 'Cedra' Izzam). Seeking refuge in a rundown amusement park, he meets Rahil (Yordanos Shiferaw), an Ethiopian refugee working as a cleaner. Taking pity on him, she agrees to let him stay with her in exchange for him looking after her one-year-old son Yonas (an absolutely astounding performance by Boluwatife Treasure Bankole) when she's at work, and the trio quickly form a close bond, until one day, Rahil doesn't return home.\n\nUtilising a documentarian style, cinematographer Christopher Aoun sticks to handheld cameras and, for the most part, natural lighting. The scenes on the streets of Beirut are especially impressive, with Labaki shooting most of the material from roughly Zain's height, or slightly lower. This allows the scenes to adopt his subjective view of the world, without having to resort to less elegant POV shots. Chadi Roukoz's sound design is also superb in these exterior scenes, with the soundtrack crammed with car horns, shouting, crying, laughter, dogs barking, airplanes flying overhead, traffic on the streets. It's an aural overload, conveying just how the massive city is overwhelming Zain, and again, tying us to his subjectivity.\n\nLabaki sets the tone for the film to come in the first shot, as we see Zain, filthy dirty, in only his vest and underwear. It's subsequently driven home multiple times that life is almost worthless here - Sahar is sold for rent money, Rahil is encouraged to sell Yonas in return for forged migrant documents. This is a world in which people think of children as commodities. In such a place, Zain somehow manages to retain his sense of empathy, although he too is infected with the concept that everything is transactional. Nevertheless, in a world where adults are reprehensible, and children their innocent victims, Zain is the story's moral compass, exhibiting a humanity far in excess of any kindness than has ever been shown to him.\n\nIn terms of problems, the framing device of the trial is awkwardly realised, and for the most part, serves only to interrupt the far more compelling story of Zain, Rahil, and Yonas. The scenes in court also come across as more heavily scripted than everything else. Obviously intended as a means to dramatize how Zain wants a voice, it is nonetheless a narrative contrivance that gets in the way of the more accomplished filmmaking seen elsewhere. Surrounded by the more naturalistic realism of the rest of the film, the court scenes stand out because they feel like a didactic plot machination. There is also something of a sense that Labaki overloads the story, pushing just one too many hardships on Zain, and on occasion, the film feels like it's going to collapse under the weight of human suffering and thematic nihilism. This is a shame because some of the best scenes are those involving Zain and Yonas just going about their day, and if Labaki had had the confidence in these quieter moments, she might have scaled back the socio-political content.\n\nNever feeling exploitative, nor glorifying the poverty at its centre, Capharnaum isn't even especially sentimental. The conclusion is disappointingly didactic, and the journey there harrowing and exhausting. However, in the last shot, Labaki dares to offer a very cautious bit of optimism, and ultimately, the takeaway is not despair, but compassion And empathy.",

It is very easy to sit in the privileged chair of an air-conditioned cinema and all the facilities that a privileged life can give and \"admire\" with the sociologist's air the misery exposed by the Lebanese director Nadine Labaki, and speak with wonders about \"Capharnaum\". It is extremely easy to contemplate the long-suffering Zain saga (Zain Al Rafeea), pose as a bar-table left intellectual, and lecture on social injustices and the need to seek a more egalitarian and less cruel society.\n\n\"Capharnaum\" is a masterpiece with which we rarely see. It is also a film about how we fail as human beings in the most varied aspects. The exploitation of misery, slave labor, violation of the most basic rights, families devastated by poverty and lack of perspective of a better situation, the illegality of immigrant life, arranged marriages in exchange for money, negligent parents with their children. \"Capharnaum\" is a rosary of personal tragedies exhibited in 125 minutes of film.\n\nIt is almost as if the region remained to this day suffering from the denial of Christ. The name of the film refers to the biblical city that was on the north shore of the Sea of Galilee. Nearby was the important Via Maris (road to the sea), which linked Egypt, Syria and Lebanon. In the Bible, Capernaum is one of the places where Jesus performed a series of miracles, such as two exorcisms, the healing of Peter's mother-in-law from a disease, and the healing of a paralytic in the well-known passage of the Bible where Jesus said to the man: \"Get up and walk.\" But, according to history, the people of the city also ended up not repenting of their sins and turned away from Jesus, who had foreseen the destruction of the city. From there, Capernaum, which was a center for tax collection and where there was also a Roman military post declined, becoming uninhabited in the fifth century after Christ.\n\nIf it is possible to draw a parallel between the Biblical Capernaum and Lebanon drawn by Nadine, it is precisely in the moral misery of the human being who exploits one another, even in the lower strata. The human being who does not repent of his sins and continues reproducing the exploratory and vicious behaviors at every moment.\n\nAt the center of the film is the story of the young Zain (lived monstrously by the boy Zain Al Rafeea). The 12-year-old forced to adulthood because of his parents' negligence, was arrested and sentenced to five years in prison for stabbing a man who had married his sister, Sahani. The reason for the crime was the death of the 11-year-old girl shortly after her pregnancy.\n\nOlder of his many brothers, Zain had been forced to mature strength to help support the family. And it is because he already has an almost adult awareness in the body of a child that the youngster decides to sue his parents for the crime of having given them life. Zain considers that his parents were criminally negligent with the whole family and can no longer have children. The evidence was in his dead sister and himself, a teenager arrested and not even formally registered.\n\nThe film alternates scenes of the trial with Zain's journey in the streets of Lebanon. Difficult life, difficulties to eat, lack of hope after losing the sister who had menstruated for the first time recently to a man who just wanted to abuse her...\n\nUntil the escape comes and Zain comes across the Ethiopian immigrant Rahil (Yordanos Shiferaw), who welcomes him. Zain then takes care of his son, Yonas (Boluwatife Treasure Bankole), until the day she just does not come back. Illegal, Rahil is caught by the police, leaving Zain alone taking care of Yonas.\n\nIt is one of the most dramatic moments of the film the period in which Zain sees himself as a father. It's heart-breaking to see him try and try to do the right thing and turn around like giving to feed the child and take care of it. Everything until the moment when it does not have more forces because the life between those who are at the margin simply can not advance.\n\nWe see all this through Zain's eyes. A boy who does not find Hollywood heroes to help him. The closest to it is the old \"Cockroach-Man\", the \"cousin of Spider-Man\", which crosses his path. Zain needs to be the hero himself. So young, the boy feels himself carrying a huge burden of existence when all he wanted was to be a good man. And his speech at the end of the film is absolutely touching at the same time that it is very hard.\n\n\"Capharnaum\" deserved more than a mere Oscar nomination for foreign film. Maybe it's the best of all those who run for the Oscars. At least Cannes recognized its value by giving it three awards last year. Nadine Labaki has made a hard and brilliant film that deserves to be seen by all.",

            "content": "Nadine Labaki's film is a stunning piece of work that is as engaging and compelling as it is depressing and devastating. Zain is a 12 years old Lebanese boy living in poverty with his parents and numerous siblings. He survives in a chaotic and far from loving environment yet he is hard-working, resourceful, responsible and way more mature than most people around him. However, he is imprisoned for a violent crime that intriguingly, the film keeps the audience in the dark about what and who is involved. His story is revealed through a court case that Zain brings against his parents for birthing him into this horrible and unjust world. Throw in an undocumented migrant worker who's also a dedicated mother and I am both surprised and captivated by this structurally intelligent and thoughtful film that fully justifies its 2hrs+ duration. Beautifully shot, Labaki's use of the visual language is sublime, finding beauty and poetry in urban decay and her compositions says so much more than words can. Casting non-actors who have similar experiences as the characters they play, she teases out performances that are raw, natural and hugely emotional, especially Zain Al Rafeea who plays Zain, who utterly mesmerizing with his expressive face and deep haunting eyes. This is a film that excels in its gritty storytelling and does so in a matter-of-fact fashion which brings not just authenticity but an emotional heft that makes this cinematic experience gripping and poignant. Except for one minor concession, the film refuses neat or contrived resolutions in favour of realism and hope in the face of despair. Moving and affecting, with a final scene that will simply break you heart, this is an indictment against human sufffering and a film I simply cannot recommend highly enough.",

            "content": "A SENSE OF URCHIN-CY - My Review of CAPERNAUM (4 Stars)\n\nWe've had so many films about impoverished children, from BICYCLE THIEVES to SALAAM BOMBAY! to SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE to LION, that it's a genre unto itself.  Call it the Street Urchin Film.  The latest entry, CAPERNAUM, which roughly translates to CHAOS, comes from Lebanese director Nadine Labecki, along with her co-writers Jihad Hojeily and Michelle Keserwany and it follows Zain (Zain Al Rafeea), a 12-year-old child whose struggles as a homeless child on the streets of Beirut leads him to sue his parents for the crime of bringing him into this terrible world.  \n\nLabecki borrows from the Italian neo-realism of Vittorio De Sica yet employs a more active camera and adds a lush score such as that heard in LION.  Although imperfect in its storytelling, this winner of the Cannes Film Festival Jury Prize, packs an emotional wallop, reducing me to loud sobs at times.  \n\nCAPERNAUM uses a trial as a framing device where a singularly focused, self-possessed Zain faces off against his parents (searing, passionate performances from Kawsar Al Haddad and Fadi Yousef), whose neglect and abuse of Zain and their large brood of children proves almost unbearable to witness.  Labecki herself very capably plays Zain's prosecuting attorney.  We know that Zain has stabbed someone, which has led to a prison sentence for the child, but we don't yet know the particulars.  Having children affords the parents many social services they would not have otherwise, but they have no means to care for these children in the first place.  Desperate for money, they resort to such actions sending Zain to various pharmacies to amass opiates, which they grind up and soak into clothing to be sold at a local prison.  They also plan on marrying off their 11-year-old daughter Sahar (an incredible performance by Haita 'Cedra Izzaim) to their landlord's lecherous son.  \n\nIt's this particular event which sends Zain over the edge in a gut punch of a sequence in which he tries to escape with his sister.  The filmmakers carefully set up their special relationship so well that their separation hurts.  Zain retreats to the streets, landing at an amusement park where he meets an undocumented Ethiopian bathroom attendant named Rahil (Yordanos Shiferaw).  Hiding from her employers the fact that she stows her infant son in a stall at work, Rahil sees in Zain an opportunity to have him babysit while she's at work in exchange for room and board.  Naturally, tragedy intervenes, forcing Zain back onto the streets, but this time literally carrying a hungry infant in his little hands.  \n\nNeedless to say, CAPERNAUM takes you to hell on earth, but through it all, Zain maintains a ferocious stance.  He bravely stands up to anyone who would try to harm him or the baby with an intense gaze or a string of expletives.  It's simultaneously remarkable and devastating to witness.  Shiferaw also gives a tremendous performance as an immigrant at the mercy of everyone she encounters.  What happens to her while Zain and her child try to survive on the streets will also break your heart.  \n\nLabecki has great storytelling abilities and a unique directorial style.  Using non-actors whose lives closely resembled those of their characters, she had a script but allowed the actors to deviate from it and send her production off on many tangents.  Shiferaw, an undocumented immigrant herself, was arrested while they were filming.  Labecki shot a huge amount of footage to assemble the story here.  Sometimes it feels like a documentary, but her instincts for shooting action sequences, birds-eye establishing shots or observant shots of Zain pulling the baby along on a skateboard with a pan attached to it, show dexterity way beyond the expected cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 style often used in films like this.  I think the framing device detracts a bit from the impact this story could have had if it were to have been told linearly, but it's a minor gripe in a film with so much empathy and respect for its subjects.  A year ago, I would have said something along the lines of, you won't believe what a child has to go through in this film.  Now, however, with children suffering in cages within our borders, it's not such a stretch and CAPERNAUM articulates the chaos with such a timely urgency.  By the time it reaches its fascinating, bittersweet conclusion, you may find yourself conflicted.  Clearly that's Labecki's intention with this angry, despairing, yet oddly optimistic little gem.",

            "content": "5/5\nI didn't realize Capernaum was the best movie of 2018 until this weekend in 2019. Actually, it's the best movie I've seen in years. Try to find it.\nZain is a whipsmart, sharp-tongued 12 year old kid, who knows how to survive in the poor neighborhoods of Beirut. His parents taught him some tricks, but they also taught him what awful people are like, so when he's had enough of them, he strikes out on his own, without a plan, just a plastic bag of stuff and his street savvy. \nThe movie is episodic, and there's a framing device involving a lawsuit he files against his parents for creating him, with the help of some do-gooder. As a reviewer, I want to express the deep humanity of this movie, and the whipsaw of emotions it gave me. Zain has a shit life, but his compassion is entirely intact, and runs deeper than most people under any circumstance. For a while, he takes over daycare for the toddler son of an Ethiopian woman named Rahil, who is working in the country illegally. When she isn't able to return one evening, and has no way of contacting Zain, he does everything he can think of to care for the child. They were already living in a corregated shack in deep poverty, so the little that Rahil provided, including breast milk, must be replaced with Zain's cunning. \nThe emotions were overwhelming at times. Firstly, Zain is a hoot, cursing like a longshoreman at all the right people. But he has understandable fury, and when he acts in out on two occasions, there's no question about the rightness of his actions. You can also imagine that a 12 year old taking care of a toddler, literally on the streets, is pretty harrowing, and such a realistic portrayal of young children in peril made me curl up in the seat more than any horror film. Finally, I shamelessly bawled near the end, during a scene of incredible tenderness; the un-looked for kindness of strangers who do nothing more than show up and sing for young incarcerated men.\nThis film won the Grand Jury Prize at Cannes in 2018, meaning that it came in second to Shoplifters, another extraordinary film about people living on the economic edge, but never losing sight of family and kindness, even if their definition of family is more transient than we usually experience. Both are truly wonderful films, but Capernaum will be in my head for days to come.",

Will wait for Ziad Doueiri's next work from Lebanon instead of giving my money ever again to this problematic director.",

These people are likely to be enjoying some sort of luxury that disconnected them from the lower class society, where individuals are learning hard to survive such harsh reality. It describes their daily life suffering with elegant realism until the viewer begins to ask questions about these problems, and more importantly, to think about finding the ways to help to deal with them.",
