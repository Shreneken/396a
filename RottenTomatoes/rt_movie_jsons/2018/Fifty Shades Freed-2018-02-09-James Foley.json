Having grown up surrounded by violence and alcoholism I can relate to Christian Grey's character all too well. Especially once you learn about his background and fears of  getting attached to anyone. His inability to differentiate violence from love was realistic and extremely sad. Also I love Dakota Johnsons sweet, innocent and gentle wittiness.\nShe was cast perfectly for the role of Heroine. The couple was depicted night and day different yet complimented each other in every way. Aside from the unnecessary nudity I found their romance simply moving and beautiful. Im not ashamed to admit I cried like a Sap during the proposal scene in part 2. All in all it came together as the perfect love story with lots of extra cheese moments I fell for hook, line and sinker and perhaps a few added cable ties, Duck tape and Rope...The complete serial killer package =)",

At this point, I don't care at all about the characters, the fact that they're getting married (spoilers if you care?) is laughably baffling and promotes all of the wrong things. The movie is another bad dialogue-fueled snooze fest that is more of the same. I think maybe 20 minutes of this movie could be seen as somewhat entertaining but it's not nearly enough to save this disaster. Overall, this has to be one of the absolute worst movie series I have ever seen. It infuriates me that this book and movie series has a following, there are countless romance stories that deserve your time. Please only watch these movies if you plan on destroying them in some sort of online review like me, otherwise you'll find your time wasted by the time you get to the lackluster finale.",

It's just two characters having sex and then the villain from the second film shows up in the third act.

Believing they have left behind shadowy figures from their past, newlyweds Christian and Ana fully embrace an inextricable connection and shared life of luxury. But just as she steps into her role as Mrs. Grey and he relaxes into an unfamiliar stability, new threats could jeopardise their happy ending before it even begins.\n\nReview:\nAfter listening to all of the hype surrounding the books, I thought that the movies would be half decent but I really wasn't that impressed with the whole franchise. This movie was the worst of the trilogy, mainly because storyline was weak and the script was extremely corny but the stalker background story made it slightly interesting. The sex scenes became tedious after a while, because we have seen the couple do every position possible in the previous movies, and the acting wasn't that great. Anyway, in this last chapter of the Fifty Shades trilogy, Christian Grey (Jamie Dorian) and Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) have finally tied the knot but Anastasia is finding it hard living the Billion dollar lifestyle, which is totally controlled by Christian. With a new threat on the horizon, the couples life is in danger, so Christian hires bodyguards to watch over them 24/7. Anastasia then finds out that she is pregnant, which puts a strain on there relationship because Christian doesn't want to be a father, so the newlyweds new life together doesn't have the best of starts. The stalker then demands $5million from Anastasia, because he has kidnapped Christian's sister but Christian manages to take control of that situation, even though Anastasia went behind his back to make the transaction. With Anastasia getting hurt during the dramatic confrontation with the stalker, Christian comes to terms with the pregnancy, and they live happily ever after. Awful storyline! I was expecting the franchise to end with a bang but every aspect of the storyline was boring and uninteresting. It seemed to be a battle for control between the couple, and with all of the money in the world at there fingertips, they really needed to put a twist in the plot to make It relatable and interesting. Anyway, I think you can tell that I really didn't like this film but I'm sure the readers of the books would have enjoyed it. Disappointing!\n\nRound-Up:\nThis movie was directed by James Foley, 64, who also brought you At Close Range, various Madonna projects, the great Glengarry Glen Ross, Fear, The Chamber, The Corrupter, Confidence, Perfect Stranger, 12 episodes of House of Cards, 2 episodes of Billions and Fifty Shades Darker. He's obviously not new to the movie making game, and I'm quite a fan of some of his work but this movie wasn't adapted for the big screen that well. With the writer of the books, E.L. James, in the producers chair, I can't totally blame the director for the end result and judging by the profit I can't really see them complaining. With the high popularity of the books, I'm not surprised that audiences flocked to the cinema to watch the trilogy but I haven't heard a good word said about the franchise. That's just proof that hype really does sell!\n\nBudget: $55million\nWorldwide Gross: $369million\n\nGenre: Drama, Romance, Thriller\nCast: Dakota Johnson, Jamie Dornan, Eric Johnson, Eloise Mumford, Rita Ora, Luke Grimes, Victor Rasuk, Max Martini, Jennifer Ehle, Marcia Gay Harden, Callum Keith Rennie and Bruce Altman. 2/10",

            "content": "After spending a week in researching this entire franchise. It's profoundly sad that  the talent that was lined up for the first film was  hijacked by the unprecedented power and oversight the Books author had. Sam Taylor-Johnson was the best thing to happen for the first, but the author wanted less class more ass.. literally.. Going through the books, and then watching the movies is disheartening.  As For the final one... omemgeeez ..I really think the only compliments to give are to the Cast and Crew for having endured-i it's unfortunate that  they had signed 3 series contract, I have a feeling they would have left with those who were trying to make it high brow but blocked by the author in almost every single way that  she could. .The Screenplays for Darker and Freed were written by E.L James's Husband..  Director James Foley comes In and took away subtle nuance's that were important and CHARACTERS who would fill the BIG GAPING Plot holes. It's drama! Sex! Drama! sex. That's the formula there. I lament for the artistry that could have been if not for ego. So I'll give it 1.5 for the car chase and Dakota Johnson, again,  upping the game, making the movie version on Anastasia much more likable than she is in the books. I've enjoyed Jamie Dornan and thought he did exceptionally well, playing a character on screen that  could have been interesting to watch  with better writing and directing. This should have all been directed and written by other women and not the author who was lucky enough to have her twilight fan fiction that allowed her to grow insanely rich and power hungry ..surely her decisions, her books, her films will go down in the history as a stain in pop culture.. You cannot buy class.",

            "content": "Fifty Shades Freed (2.5 out of 5 stars). The final installment to the erotic romantic series that has a big fan base with the ladies. Fifty Shades Freed sadly was a complete miss when the film did not improve from the others. It still fell under its terrible writing, stale performances, and a plot less erotic romance movie that not only had no story but did not add anything new to its genre. I am only excited that the series is coming to a conclusion. Not a good one. But it does wrap its story and why Christian Grey has had his issues with wanting things a certain way. The plot follows right after the second movie. Anastasia (Dakota Johnson) and Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) both get married. They go on their honeymoon with several trips to Paris to a hiking resort. And have lots of sex. The sex scenes were not that appealing to even be categorized as an erotic movie to begin with. Meanwhile, Anastasia stalker Jack (Eric Johnson) from the last movie were she rejected his offer of being with him. He is so obsessed with Anastasia that he is willing to go extra lengths to sabotage Grey's company and her life. That is basically all there is to the plot. No progression to the story. Just seeing Christian and Anastasia traveling. While he gives Ana a lot of rules that he wants her to obey which she does not listen. And a stalker that is suppose to build up to the climax of the movie. The script is filled with clich√©s and terrible dialogue. Which also does not help with the performances. I thought the performances would improve through the sequels. Apparently not. Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan both give stale performances like they are reading straight out of the script. At least, it is a little better than Kristen Stewart from the Twilight movies. The direction does offer some beautiful landscapes and cinematography shots of Ana and Christian's traveling. Filled with a worthwhile soundtrack. I have never read the novels. I am not sure how steamy the sex sequences are. But I feel like the film does hold back and censor it down. There are several sex scenes that may excite the erotic enthusiasts with the genre. Overall, Fifty Shades Freed is a bad film. It serves well with concluding the trilogy and a mid credit scene that will have the fans go aww. The film brings nothing new to the table. Performances were stale, direction and plot was dull, and the script is terrible with clich√©s. I do not recommend the film. Unless you are a huge fan of the novels and the previous films. Then, I will say it is considered as a rental.",

            "content": "One hundred and fifty shades as a lightweight and flat-footed alternative of melodramatic entertainment\n\nBefore starting, I must confess: I liked the first movie, I'm sorry. Here the justifications, I ask for your understanding. I was a lively teenager, at that time I was 15 years old and there was a real pleasure in violating the rules of movie ratings, sneaking into the rooms to see R-rated films became a dangerous obsession, which caused that, to some degree, lose objectivity by reviewing a film, bearing the added value of the huge buzz and a challenging and always-interesting divergence between critics and audience. Such was the degree of fixation that, at the end of the day, I ended up reading the e-book, a 14-year-old Colombian young boy consuming the sexist and damaging romantic adventures of Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele, feeling a shameful satisfaction in boasting about read and watched the first adaptation of the bestseller with my personal circle, even to the point of choosing it for inaugurate my own database on my favorite flicks, a file folder on my laptop titled \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" where there are records about its worldwide grossing, every marketing poster, every critic review, every written and video interview, every composition or song from the soundtrack, every person involved in the production; it's sad, disappointing and ignominious look back on, realize and accept the big, big mistake in selecting it as the privileged one. Only three years have passed but it was time enough to get back to reality and remove from my eyes that fabricated beauty filter superimposed on this kind of stories, which, objectively, I consider as a fascinating box office hit and an effective marketing strategy camouflaging soft-porn in the lewd and exaggerated experience sold by the trailers and TV spots, however, beyond its suggestive and captious global advertising campaigns, its overwhelming commercial reception and its bailable contemporary soundtrack, little or nothing will be extracted from E.L. James' adapted trilogy. And this is even more valid if you're rigorous with the newest and \"last\" installment of this guilty pleasure - if desired, omit the \"pleasure\" -, because \"Freed\", again directed by James Foley, provides a correct minimum help to the headache that \"Darker\" meant, the film gets it through mechanisms a little more realistic, however, it keeps to set them over melodrama and incoherence. The movie betrays its principles voluntarily and the worst thing is that it doesn't care at all and Universal knows it, cinematographically speaking, this franchise is nothing more than - as the billionaire protagonist said - flowers and hearts, sighs of \"mature\" societies that are the true signals of money, empty money. The craving for money is evident, releasing them as close as possible, even filming them in a row the second and third entry in order to not waste time disconnecting the public (prey) from the product (hunter), one notices the poor interest recruiting new minds after the ghastly stumble that was the sequel, they simply wanted it bigger, hypothetically more provocative, pompous, incompetent and synthetic, and they achieved it.\n\nFrom a neutral point of view and recognizing exaggeratedly-low quality standards, one could say that the franchise has come from more to less, a decline that has bottomed out. Although the first entry had the benefit of doubt by those who got E.L. James' books as a toxic literary venom, also visually looked acceptable and attractive, adding the surprising boom it received thanks to artists as The Weeknd, Sia, Beyonc√© and Ellie Goulding whose commercial triumph of their pop hits belonging to the soundtrack, and furthermore, it breaks new ground for a studio by being one of the first movies to materialize a polarizing sexual practice (BDSM) \"without taboo whatsoever\", yeah, this must be discussed when it only shows the breasts of the leading role; does a lightness strengthened by movie ratings guarantee higher grosses? A set of factors that ensured an almost general magnetism for audiences with the idea, as it ended its worldwide run with a whopping $571 million dollars. Two years later, \"Darker\" hit cinemas, and all the minimum possible expectations disappeared. Only a heavy-handed few expected a better made and structured sequel, so do I, but a really few correct shots and the musical success that went to ZAYN and Taylor Swift by \"I Don't Wanna Live Forever\" were the only two saveable components of another pathetic and cheesy loving mess that, personally, served as a definitive signal to understand that this romantic follow-up movie was one of the worst in the history of cinema. Today, the lucky climax comes to theaters again produced by mega-studio Universal Pictures, now things are sweetened in excess, because of being a story about sexual maturity - by the way that never really happens - of a twenty-seven-year-old self-made millionaire and an English literature college student, it becomes a story about the usual post-marital problems between a dominant man and a now-empowered woman who wants to have children but not to stop fuc%ing \"hard\" with her husband, nothing suggestive, a headache with new levels of humiliation before a mostly-great movie studio.  \n\nIt's possible to define the incongruousness, incompetence, absurdity, pedantry of this script in just one two-word line, which is paraphrased by the great actress Dakota Johnson through, sadly, the role giving her worldwide reputation. That affirmation takes place in the initial scenes of the film, where they want to celebrate a major event, and she said it with such insolence that is offensive: \"Is it yours?\" (She's talking about a private jet with two beefy security agents on the doors.) What? How is it possible that after a year and a half sleeping together in the same bed, an enviable salary and an almost-a-trillion-dollar grossing she doesn't know that she must stop talking nonsense, he's your husband now, you know he has tons of money, don't you?, with just one sentence, this film provoked an absolute suppression of a serious and rigid review, therefore, I simply sat down on that dark seat to capture blunders and blunders from the beginning of the action to the arrive of the closing credits, I survived miraculously. The situations are odiously synthetic as the same film contradicts its convictions, it gives vain power to a woman, who a few seconds later, is tied to the cold bed, being crippled with the sexual deprivation of her husband, I think It isn't the prototype of  tale that feminist movements request right now, nobody wants to see a film that preaches one thing and practice another, a pure-marketing joke like this cannot be accepted. As well as many of the unsatisfactory lame present-day audiovisual productions, the script intends to endow a kind of artificial empowerment to Anastasia, however, the plasticity doesn't last long due to the poor and incongruous material Johnson gets: At what point does Anastasia Steele become Vin Diesel in Christian's onerous car? The failed granting of female power is worsened by a harmful mix of genres, a tendency in excess in the chaotic second part. You will suffer a love, maturation, action, kidnapping story, a thriller, a cheap comedy and, in short, a miserable and comical hotchpotch of genres in the worst effective ways conceived by Hollywood. Absurdities emerge from the script like hotcakes, here another one of them: Christian keeps unreasonably an eye on his wife due to a writer with \"presence\" who discusses possible contracts with the firm, nonetheless contemplating his obsessive and maniac jealousy, he hires a handsome bodyguard who could easily be the one to get his dear girl off his side, wait a minute, what? Is that logical? Although there are no plane crashes, labor harassment, suicidal chicks or older \"friends\"; there are incredibly unbearable plays deriving from such rich issues as responsibility, marriage and motherhood.\n\nNormally, in my reviews I talk about performances in a positive way, i.e., if such a component isn't a strong point in the film I opt to omit it, however, most of the time I evaluated them since they are a fundamental part in the harmonious ensemble that made up a feature film. With surmised anticipation, \"Freed\" has broken the rule.  I'm ready to write, with the utmost respect and humility, about Jamie Dornan, Eric Johnson and the remaining cast, except Dakota, who performed lousy characters, at least, that keeps it coherent. Watching the opening scenes and instantly perceive the lack of naturalness and estimation in performances is awful and sad, there is no soul or charm, they're deprived of any dynamic or potential, just unmotivated, they seem the first labor opportunity of college actors, it's terribly unacceptable. Likewise, the leading male character never loses that look of concern or that frown when some fatuous vicissitudes arise in the script, we never knew about which \"fifty\" shadows they've been spoken for more than three hours, he simply seems to be an eye-candy and something else. Dakota Johnson is the only one who impregnates a bit of love on her character, half-heartedly. All right, she's tender, na√Øve and unnecessarily submissive, but Johnson knows how to turn the card around and get the spectator to try to accept her motivations, an event that never happens. It must be noted that \"Freed\" plays a similar role to \"Dunkirk\" for British singer and songwriter Harry styles or \"Mudbound\" for Mary J. Blige, the radical difference is that Rita Ora doesn't get the expected result with a pastiche character. Another damsel in distress who must be harmed by a stupid villain is unhelpful for this multifaceted woman to show off all her talent, but at least, compared to other characters, crying gagged in a chair surpasses many of her co-stars.\n\nIt's cumbersome and delicate to talk about this feature owing to its nature but it's a matter to discuss: the sexual scenes. It's not a secret that for many people the main motive inciting them (mostly young people) to attend a theatre is the curiosity to watch them surrounded by a considerable number of people,  a couple having peculiar erotic relations, intimate acts portrayed on the screen smoother than the explicit and bawdy descriptions by the author in the books. Inside a tub, at Mia's, in red rooms, black rooms, cars or beds, any clich√© and \"coveted\" place will have the shameful DNA of \"Freed\". Artistically, they aren't a feat of art, shots that focus on Anastasia's panting mouth or Christian's muscular back, arrhythmic sequences in which you can feel the lack of feeling between these actors, and even so Dornan claims that he made sure to make his co-star laugh in this kind of scene, I think it was in the final cut. There were great possibilities with BDSM and the sadistic mind of the protagonist as main elements, but they shouldn't increase the range of creativity, however, vibrators and ice cream is the only thing you get from the \"climax cinematic you cannot miss\" - please, read it with the deep and captivating voice from TV spots. -\n\nNor does it have much to brag about in visual terms. From Seattle cold landscapes to luxurious closed spaces, the movie is, almost entirely, locked in the city and in burdensome rooms, only a couple of scenes were filmed in a forest. Metallic colors predominate and a beautiful white is only glimpsed at the beginning, a necessary contrast of repetitive dark nuances. In a nutshell, visually, you expect on the screen, again and again, Johnson's breasts and the same black shoes that Christian wears in two different scenes.\n\nEasily the best part of all this suffering: a fantastic musical accompaniment. And we don't talk about the work done by Danny Elfman, usual composer of the franchise, we refer (again) to catchy hits from artists such as Julia Michaels, Hailee Steinfeld or Rita Ora and Liam Payne, who take part of a score that will be the next playlist for millennials for a while, electronic danceable sounds provide a kind of uninhibited tone to the scenes, the sad thing here is that even these songs are inserted in a wrong way, I mean there is no cohesion between harmony of a song and the timing of the moment, besides, there are some hits really wasted thanks to falsely ingenious intros. \n\nChristian closing the door of his red room in the face of his audience is a cynical sign of the little importance that the demanding public meant to this franchise. Seeing women and men dressed as the bride and groom going into the theater reflects the scope achieved by Universal's movies in the mind of most fans of books and movies, however, the opposing group, the disillusioned ones and/or detractors, has to make do with an ending very similar to that of \"The Hunger Games\" saga- with a scene almost identical -, which concludes the story as badly as it was developed. \"Fifty Shades Freed\" by James Foley finally says goodbye to the goose that lays golden eggs, bye bye melodramatic loves and dopey plot decisions, gone are those dark times, the light has come not only for the protagonist, also for the public. The short summary created by the flick in the third act, shows the abysmal decay that the movie suffered, simply to conclude with an ending as stereotyped as the film itself. The movie franchise was a very tough nut to crack, but Universal Pictures has broken hearts this Valentine's Day, because its great love, that lover which gave it exorbitant amounts of money, is gone forever, so they say.",

            "content": "Finally the Fifty Shades of Grey franchise has reached its thrilling(?) climax with Fifty Shades Freed, the epic(?) conclusion to the iconic(?) trilogy¬†which understands what it is and accepts defeat..... or triumph if you look at the box office. This is a franchise that has been plagued with terrible writing, directing, and performances and despite how bad it began it has actually somehow been degrading in quality. This final entry's plot is about what it's like to be married to a controlling douchebag whilst your psychopathic ex-boss wants revenge. I have to give the film props for originality because I don't recall ever seeing a plot so shallow and full of nothing that it's more repulsive than enticing. This entry, like Fifty Shades Darker,¬†is written by Niall Leonard, the husband of the novel author E. L. James and if that film proved anything it's that this team-up produces some hilariously awful writing. The way the lack of plot progresses is a mess, the dialogue goes to laughably bad places, and the implementation of a thriller subplot is horrendous to where I honestly didn't expect anything better (if the helicopter kerfuffle in the last film is anything to go by). Lets break down this finale and give the franchise a fitting goodbye.¬†\n\n\n\nAs with the last film in the series there's barely any focus in the plot, the first two thirds of the movie isn't really about anything specific other than the married life of Christian and Anastasia Grey. The thing is there's nothing new with this relationship, they still have spontaneous sex, Christian is still overly intrusive of Anastasia's life, and Anastasia's character is still unbelievably hooked on this douchebag of a guy. The only sense of progression in their relationship is that they now fully understand each-others sexual desires. And HOLY FUCK, there's a moment in here where Christian takes Anastasia to his private jet and she is genuinely surprised he has one. Are you going to tell me that after all of the bullshit of the last two films she didn't think he'd have his own jet? Get the fuck outta here.\n\nI don't know about you but the struggles of being married to an absolute tool isn't interesting enough to fill a feature length film, and it seems that's exactly what the writers think too. There's a cliche crime thriller subplot woven into this story at one or two moments in the first two acts and then is the centrepiece of the climax of the franchise for some dumbass reason. It's so awfully executed that it fits in with the franchise brilliantly. A lot of what happens with this subplot doesn't really make sense and the reasoning for all of these happenings is beyond ridiculous. There's no life in this story, it's just a slow dull feature film soap opera with sex and somehow less engaging characters. OH! And theres a moment in here that makes me want Anastasia to headline her own Need for Speed or Fast and Furious spinoff because who knew she turns into Vin Diesel behind the wheel.¬†\n\n\n\nThe dialogue is all sorts of bad, lazy, and laughable. Next to none of what is being said feels natural, every line between Christian and Ana feels scripted and you never feel like you're watching a real married human couple converse. The delivery from Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson isn't spectacular but with the shit they're given to work with I don't blame them. Even Dakota who in the beginning of the franchise looked as though she was trying to bring something to her character has just completely given into the fact that any effort here would be wasted. If there's a fourth film where it's revealed Christian Grey is a soulless being from another realm I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest because the character is simply lacking of any evident personality. But hey, it's about time for a positive and that is that despite how messy and unfocused the plot is, there is ever so slightly more cohesion than the last film.... take it or leave it people. There is a decent soundtrack but its presence can't be used to praise the movie because it's not at all integrated into the story whatsoever. It has no bearing on what is going on and plays out like a music video where you could insert any 'greatest hits of' album and the film itself won't be any better. But really it's because I couldn't possibly knock down Hailee Steinfeld's \"Capital Letters\". I also do appreciate the slightly lower runtime as it means less of my time is wasted on this thing.¬†\n\n\n\nNow for some transparency....\n\nBut look, as much as it is so damn easy to shit all over this franchise you can't really fault the decisions made here from a business standpoint. The filmmakers found their niche audience with the first film and decided to stick with what has been working this whole time as its been turning in a profit. So really if you look at what the writers and director¬†James Foley¬†set out to do with this film they accomplished their goals and got the results they wanted. They knew critics would bash it, they knew a general movie-going audience wouldn't go to see it, but they also knew the audience they established with the first two films would return and clearly they did so well done I say. But that being said, I don't have that fan approach so to me it's an unenjoyable yet laughable piece of crap I am thrilled to see disappear.¬†\n\n1/10",

You might be wondering if that's a bit of an exaggeration but when a movie gives me eye cancer it's well-deserved. And if you think that the hate on this trilogy is undeserved, you should refrain yourself from watching films and shouldn't even have an opinion about anything in life (irony, but you see my point). But how does this sexist, overtly heinous piece of \"film\" gets to be widely popular and seen around the world? Is it because people don't know there is porn that is way hotter and way better acted? Or is it because people are drawn to watching turds? I really do not care for the answer because if you're a woman and you get excited for this film, you pay to see it and then don't notice the obvious sexism and male dominance that is present in all three of these movies which is coated with a sugar layer of fake female independence, then YOU are to blame. The lovemaking scenes aren't even hot, the leads have as much chemistry as water and olive oil and there is nothing redeemable whatsoever. And maybe, just maybe, that's because it's based on a fan-fiction novel written by someone who doesn't know the first thing about putting pen to paper and maybe, just fricking maybe, that's because it's adapted by her husband who seems to be an amnesiac bafoon having no concept of how people speak in the real world (not every conversation is done by whisper!). It's by far the worst movie I've seen this year because it doesn't even realize how dumb it is and proceeds on dealing with hard issues like the decision of having a child and death like it's a go on the bumper cars (oh, I just bumped into abortion, ups!). The only thing that is slightly better than its predecessors is the length, as it has 20 minutes less of pure hell than the other two. It may seem that I'm angry and I am! But I can't lie that it's a movie so bad that I just went into the theatre and laughed my heart out. And I went to see it because it was (50 shades) free, I wouldn't contribute to its progression. I'm neither a woman nor a target but when you are, you should watch what you're buying.You may be just buying a ticket to a movie that sends women 40 years back.

This isn't Paranormal Activity or Call of Duty, where every year or so, these things are just pooped out. It's over. I haven't read any of these novels, and I don't plan on reading them. I have seen the last two films though, so of course I'm going to close out this trilogy. I can tolerate the first film; I don't think it's the absolutely worst film of that year. Fifty Shades Darker, however, oh boy. I hate it. I just hate that film, almost everything about it except for the soundtrack. This franchise's soundtracks are consistently pretty good. Compared to the other two, I sincerely enjoyed bits here and there. But no, this film is not good. Much sexier than the other two with more steamy scenes, but it's still a film with bad dialogue and story.\n\nDakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan are two very charming and lovely people. These characters and their relationship though, the way it has been portrayed on screen these last few years, all of it is just so toxic. If you thoroughly enjoyed the last two films and fall for these characters, you will love this film and its ending. But my god, Jamie Dornan's Christian Grey is just such a fucked up human being, so needy and complicated, unnecessarily angry at the smallest things. Paying attention to the actual written dialogue, I have a lot of issues. There's a moment when Anastasia tries to explain to Christian that she doesn't want to be a housewife; she just wants to work hard. She doesn't want people to think she got to where she is just by who she's married to...when clearly she has. This character literally gets a promotion while on her honeymoon. A promotion at the company her husband owns. Did I miss something? There are others but it'll be too much to include here, so I won't.\nNow, I want to take this time to discuss the film's Batman antagonist who apparently is a master hacker/bomber/speed racer/saboteur/kidnapper. I cannot make this up. I thought I jumped into an entirely different film at times. There are quite a few intense action sequences, one opening the film, and one ending it. If you don't find yourself caring much for the rest of the film's story points, you just may enjoy this plot scattered throughout.",

Will they be able to keep the excitement in their marriage?  Will that rape-y boss from the second movie (Eric Johnson) be able to overcome all odds and ruin their happily ever after?  Well, you're just going to have to find out for yourself!  Now I'm not about to be the one to spoil the finale of the Grey trilogy... yeah, I wasn't able to type that without laughing.  Because I do watch every movie that I can get my hands on, I can say that yes, I have seen the entirety of this series (and yes, I have also seen all five Twilight movies as well).  I do understand that this was not made with me in mind, but I am still glad to see this reach its final punctuation.  Now I don't buy into the people that say that this is empowering feminism, because it's most definitely not that; we clearly have very different definitions of the word if that is the argument that you're making.  This is just about Plain Jane who wants to be whisked away in this fantasy, and when I say fantasy, I'm not even talking about sexual fantasy, I'm talking about monetary fantasy filled with houses, cars, exotic trips and male attention.  Apart from the physical restraints, the sex in this is actually vanilla for the most part.  They make this giant deal about how Christian is dark and can only have extremely sordid sex, but when you break it down, this isn't the case.  He's just this really clingy guy with stalker tendencies, and that is about it.  He has a bunch of corny lines, and while I do think that Dakota Johnson is at least trying, I think Jamie Dornan is dreadful and will not have a career after this.  This is bad, but it's not so bad that I will want to renounce my friendship with you if this happens to be your thing.  It will make me question any recommendations you give me, but that's about it.  This is melodramatic literal Twilight fan-fiction, but at the very least it was a movie that I was able to get enjoyment from just laughing at it.  I don't think I have ever seen a movie try to sell its soundtrack harder than this one does here, and it presents itself at full volume at every single presented opportunity.  I do not see this series continuing unless they want to give us Fifty Grey Babies, or the Evil League of Fifty Ex-Lovers.",

It just didn't make any sense and it's sad that so many people will lose their money seeing a crappy movie now because it's the last one and everyone needs to see how it ends. Stick to the books you won't be walking out disappointed like I did in the movie theater.",

I was looking for more action, and drama from jack, and Christians mistress that Anna saw a text from. She was all upset about it, and then its like it never happened and was totally forgotten about.. I wish there was more action and drama... but nope.. i was EXTREMELY disappointed.

        {
            "content": "I think Fifty Shades Freed as a title works well not just for the audience but also the actors, as everyone is celebrating putting one of Hollywood's least engaging film franchises well behind them. E. L. James' best-selling erotic novels have made for pretty lifeless big screen entries. Director James Foley (Glengarry Glen Ross) is free from having to bring this silly thing to straight-laced life. The actors are free at last from the mechanical sex scenes that populate these films, free at last from their terrible chemistry with which they cannot conceal, free at last from having to say stilted dialogue for stilted characters, and free at last from the six hours of boredom and overstated kink. This is a franchise that wants to go out in a toe-curling climax but goes out with a whimper. If you're like me you'll scratch your head and wonder, \"Was that it?\"\n\nAnastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) and Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) are now Mr. and Mrs. Grey. While honeymooning in France, Christian still can't help his domineering ways and instructs Ana not to sunbathe topless. She finds ways to assert her independence and defiance. Meanwhile, the happy couple is challenged by two foes: a vengeful Jack Hyde (Eric Johnson) and the prospect of children.\n\nIt's hard to say which in this trilogy is the worst film but I still venture that the second, Fifty Shades Darker, is the winner in that regard. It's hilariously bad and incompetent, whereas Fifty Shades Freed is slightly better simply because there's less of everything, which also includes less of a reason to exist. If you thought the previous film was struggling to stretch enough story to fill a feature-length runtime, then just wait until you watch the new movie where we have such scintillating plotlines like whether Christian's brother might be cheating on his girlfriend or Christian being mad because Ana hasn't changed her work email to her new married name. That last item also serves as another blaring waning sign about the scary control freak that is this franchise's supposed brooding, Byronic hero, but we'll get more into that later. The characters introduced in the last film don't really matter. There just isn't a credible story here, which may be why this is the first Fifty Shades to clock in short of two hours (and it has a montage that cycles through highlights of the trilogy). The problem is that the last film mostly completed the journey of Christian Grey from bad boyfriend material to slightly less bad marriage material, as he got down on one knee and proposed to Ana. He learned to settle down, open up about his past behavior, and start the process of compromise. With Fifty Shades Freed, we start off with them getting married and their frolicking honeymoon, and the movie seems to exist in that post-\"happily ever after\" phase of romances that we rarely see because nobody wants to know what happens after the couple gets their Big Closing Kiss. Does anybody want to check in with Cinderella and Prince Charming arguing over who has to do the dishes (trick question: it's the servants)?\n\nConflicts are once again introduced and hastily taken care of, much like the laugh-out-loud helicopter crash from that last film that was resolved in the very next scene. They've carried over a lackluster villain from the second film, Ana's unfortunately named old boss Jack Hyde who tried to sexually assault her. This man worked as a fiction editor in the world of publishing and now suddenly he's an expert on kidnapping, breaking and entering, and stalking. It's a ridiculous threat meant to provide some level of dread and danger, except he's easily dispatched by the end of Act One. There's a hilarious courtroom scene where his lawyer is trying to argue that Jack was simply trying to work things out after exhausting all his communication resources. Ignore the fact he held a knife to Ana's throat. He goes away for the second act only to, surprise, come back in another stupidly preposterous way to re-establish his menacing threat... only to once again be easily dispatched in an anticlimactic manner. This guy sucks. The screenplay tries to hastily add some duality to Jack, saying he despises Christian Grey for denying him the life he deserved. Apparently (spoiler alert but do you actually care anymore?) Jack and Christian were in the same Detroit foster care system together and I guess Jack assumes without Christian he would have been adopted by wealthy elites instead? Jack seemed to make a name for himself even without that cushy starting point. Mostly this is another Fifty Shades movie that feels like it has time to fill and time to kill.\n\nThat's where you'd expect the steamy sex scenes to provide a jolt. Isn't the whole purpose of this franchise watching pretty people get naked and do sexy things? For all its whips and chains and BDSM banter, the Fifty Shades sex has been tepidly tame. As I wrote previously of this franchise: \"I cannot overstate just how dull and lazily staged the sex scenes are in the film, extinguishing any kind of titillation and strangely demurring once things get passionate. The nubile bodies are on display, Johnson's in semi-permanent arched back, though Dornan is often coquettishly obscured (sorry ladies). The word that seems most appropriate for the sex scenes is 'anticlimactic.' Ana jokes that she's a vanilla girl and trapping Christian into a plain relationship, and their big screen sex life typifies this (anyone remember Ana's question about what a butt plug was?). It's a world of kink where nipple clamps are giggle-worthy accessories to the participants and the go-to sexual position is missionary. This movie is not the daring dip into untapped sensuality it's been made out to be. It's much more conservative at heart.\"\n\nThe lusty thrills are of the soft-core porn variety with close-ups of erect nipples and heavy breathing. The sex scenes in the second film were most strange because they all followed a routine that was cut short once actually sex began, cruelly teasing the target audience. By my count, there are three actual sex scenes in Fifty Shades Freed and two or so aborted efforts. The strongest sex scene is the one that feels inspired from 9 1/2 Weeks, where Ana takes control and dabbles melted dollops of ice cream over Christian's shirtless torso only to lovingly lap up every morsel. It's the only scene that feels like it has some spontaneity and sexiness. Maybe it's because it breaks free from their Red Room routines or maybe it's because it has Ana in charge, or maybe it's just residual good will from memories of 9  1/2 Weeks (side note: I re-watched it a year ago as \"research\" for a short script, and it is not as sexy as you've been told. There's an extended sex scene on the scuzziest and grimiest fire escape stairs in the rain). Another disappointment for its intended audience must be the lack of full-frontal male nudity, something each film has curiously shied away from. There is plenty of Jamie Dornan's pubic hair, which I guess was dangled as a concession to the fans. If you came to watch erotic sex scenes you'd be better off getting off from late night cable.\n\nWith bad sex, bad storytelling, and bad pacing, what we're left with is the closing realization that these two people really shouldn't be together. Much of the second half of this movie revolves around a core difference over their views on children: Ana wants them and Christian is less than enthusiastic. This is a conversation that should have taken place before they got hitched. It's another example of Christian not wanting to share Ana with anyone (he literally says this in response to being a potential father). You can bring the man to sing a dopey love song on the piano but you still can't remove all the scary, controlling elements of his character. I think ultimately Christian's love of bondage is because he is portrayed as being damaged, abused, and this informs his sexuality. While that may be the case for various people, transforming moments of trauma into uncontrollable and subconscious desires or titillation, it presents a pretty distorted picture of the consenting adults who frequently enjoy participating in BDSM. These people are simply not that interesting. Anastasia Steele (and it pains me every time to type that out) is a mousy audience surrogate meant to be whisked away into a hidden world of luxury, where the hunky man is obsessed with having her, and only the power of her love can make him whole again. That doesn't exactly sound like the makings of a healthy relationship, and the fact that it's spun into being a smutty fairy tale is even more disconcerting. The Twilight fan fiction origins become clearer with every film.\n\nStruggling to justify its whole existence for 105 lugubrious minutes, Fifty Shades Freed is the flaccid finale to a boring and underwhelming trilogy. I have no problems with movies whose sole purpose is to turn on their audience. Erotic movies certainly have their place in the landscape. They can even be specifically designed for very specific audiences that do not include me, and the Fifty Shades series is definitely not my kind of smut. I'm not the target audience but I'm open to interesting stories and visceral sexuality. With how redundant and tedious the film franchise is, I think I'll recycle yet again an observation I wrote of the original film: \"Surprisingly boring and rather tepid, Fifty Shades of Grey feels too callow to be the provocative film experience it wants to be. It needs more of just about everything; more characterization, more organic coupling, more story, more romance, more kink. It is lacking in too many areas, though the production values are sleek, like it's the most technically accomplished episode of Red Shoe Diaries.\" Skip the Red Room, these insipid characters, and the high-camp tawdry attempts at sensuality. The final Fifty Shades is a fitting end for a franchise that could never get its mojo going.\n\nNate's Grade: C-",

The only good acting in the entire film comes from the banker. The plot is lazily thrown together and the attempts at suspense are god awful. The only people who will enjoy or defend this movie are absolute die hard fans. If you consider yourself a movie buff or even just someone who casually enjoys movies, DO NOT SEE THIS. I will spare you the frustration. I even enjoy bad movies, I love having fun with a bad movie and making jokes about it to my friends while we watch it. I did that in this film but even that was not enough to make this an enjoyable experience. The \"BDSM\" in this film is a sad sad portrayal that only the oldest, driest, and most sexually frustrated wine moms will find arousing. A TSA pat-down is kinkier than this excuse for erotica. The sex scenes feel very required and obtuse. The ending is a horrible attempt to tie things up and make them feel complete, it is incredibly cheesy, as is every single bit of dialogue in this film.

Christian and Anastasia carry their relationship to the logical conclusion for many people in love - they marry. \n\nFor dramatic tension, the characters of Christian and Anna tackle a number of issues which beset people in wedded bliss, including Christian's desire to control Anna versus Anna's desire for independence. \n\nUnfortunately, many of the best scenes have been spoiled by placing them in movie trailers - if you've seen the trailers, you can already figure out several important and pivotal plot points. \n\nTo be fair, 50 Shades Freed was obviously a labor of love for each person involved. The actors all go above and beyond, and the direction and editing are more than adequate. The movie will not appeal to everyone, nor should it. However, the amount of hate and low ratings seen on Fandango, on Rotten Tomatoes and on lMDB is a testament to the number of minds in modern society which are screaming for sexual liberation. \n\nWhy would you spend time watching a movie which glorifies something you deem objectionable? If BDSM offends you, why watch a movie with kinky sex featured at its core? Who is forcing this \"torture\" upon you? Unless you're paid to review movies, you don't have to watch anything which offends you. For example: If you don't like or want sex, it is a crime to have it forced upon you (it's called rape). in other words: DON'T REVIEW MOVlES THAT ARE ABOUT THINGS YOU DON'T LIKE, WANT OR UNDERSTAND; in the end, you will be much happier. \n\nWatch what you want - but try to keep an open mind, because most cinematic projects involve thousands of man hours of work, planning and execution. The end result is never assured - but everyone has a dream, and sometimes that dream is shared by others - the fans. Don't tell us what art is. Don't tell us what NOT to enjoy, and we'll try to do the same. \n\n- Chipper F. Xavier, Esq.",

To be fair, the movie is for the most part very faithful to EL James' terrible novel as are the first two films.  That's one positive thing to say.  Also Dakota Johnson does give her best performance in this series here.  Her high point is the scene where her character confronts Jamie Dornan's character after he walks out when she tells him she is pregnant.  That scene is the only one in the movie that worked for me (The scene where Anastasia tells the architect to stop eyef---ing Christian is a very close second.).  The movie also suffers from a painfully obvious kidnapping storyline which had no surprises whatsoever.  In the case of this film series, the third time is definitely not the charm.  If you want to see a truly excellent erotic thriller, see Brian DePalma's 1980 masterpiece \"Dressed to Kill\".",

Don't hate on a movie if you didn't read the books or didn't see the first two.  Dakota and Jamie had amazing chemistry and the follow was almost perfect. I cant wait till it comes out on DVD.",
