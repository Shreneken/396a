While it was carrying on and on the movie kept feeling like it was dragging and when ever I checked how much time was left, there was still a long way to go. I shouldn't have felt the annoyance the pressure just to get this movie done with. This movie had sound that was actually quite a headache because when something creepy was about to happen, it went from deep sound to really high pitched noises that kept on getting louder and louder which did was not Slender man at all, we shouldn't have expected a haunting to happen at all it should be dead silent, completely normal and then Bam! Jump scare. Nothing in this movie worked cohesively, the video, the haunting, and the sound just didn't work at all. You know what...I would rather watch a junk spoof that's self aware for it's silliness than this. Save yourself from wasting your time because I do not recommend watching this movie.",

But the problem is they don't particularly stand out.  Even in the grand scheme of things with the Slender Man himself, their story is not that special.\nThe writer was very limited on what they could do with Slender as he has no discernible personality.  He just goes after them and screws with them in the process.  His metrology could be compared to Pennywise the Clown from IT, but with much less flare. \nThere is also a big theme of hopelessness throughout the film.  They didn't meet with a scientist (which is odd because they found their book) to find a way out.  At no point did they even try to come up with a clever way to get rid of him in the end. \n\nA few technical great spots but there are also scenes where it's too dark to see.\n\nWatch if you want but don't expect much in terms of substance.",

Very one dimensional characters, they didn't spend any time showing who these kids are or giving any reason to root for them, other than the missing girl having a bad home life and an alcoholic father.  The most character building you get is a couple seconds of dialogue halfway through the movie.  Also no one actually acts like this.\n\nAlso the whole moving is so dark.

They were really creative on how they delivered them, and also the transitions afterwards were really clever and well made. \nThe main details about this film that I enjoyed were the foreshadowing on the main villain. For example, during one of the scenes in the bedroom, you see Slenderman's shadow emerge behind them. How scary!\nFurthermore, it is a very progressive film, as I thought all of the main characters were all diversified and well written. In addition to that, the main protagonists were all female, which should be a good standard for films to come. This is a good contrast to the new Ghostbusters film, which was criticised for having an all female cast, as the cost of good writing. This film delivers both; a good diverse cast and good detailed writing. \nVery good film and would recommend to anyone who is wanting to get into the genre! \nGood tidings and viewings!\nConor, L., (2021).",

There was even a part where one of the girls screams \"take me!!!(instead of her sister) and the Slenderman appears and...she. runs. away. \n\nOk.  \nThe film seems very rushed to make a buck and vaguely slapped together by people who had no idea of what this was and never visited creepy pasta stuff.",

Seriously, Imagine if you had your own movie and you only had 5 minutes of Screentime.\n\n-The Characters: \nThey were flat like paper, Who would want to watch a horror film where some group of teenagers scream every 5 damn seconds? And due to them summoning Slender Man for some reason, their dumbass actions get themselves disappearing one by one.\n\n-The Ending: \nOkay... What? So Basically this film ends with one of the characters getting teleported to the forest where the Slender Man is located, she encounters and gets chased by Slender Man, The character gets turned into a tree just to save her sister, and then the sister talks about how the slender sickness spreads or something and then the film ends. Like.. what?\n\n-The PG-13 rating: \nThis rating really bothers me, I don't remember Slender Man being a PG-13 Character... And this was probably the reason a fuckton of scenes were cut.\n\n-False Advertising:\nLots and lots of scenes from the trailers ended up getting cut. hell, even a character named \"Allison\" ended up being cut,\n\nAt the end of the day, This Movie is pretty \"meh\" that really could've been better and I wouldn't recommend it.",

It's 4-5 shallow, empty characters with just enough flavor to tell them apart, and I just can't care about them.\n\nThe movie focuses on the subtly of it all, the growing madness that Slender Man instills in his victims without properly building the tension or showing the characters slowly losing it, which would have given good actors the ability to save it.  Instead they use a lot of \"it happened offscreen\" or sudden cuts to show a lose of time, and we get a character suddenly looking confused instead of taking the audience on a journey with the character.\n\nMaybe it's not the writing, and maybe the editor just didn't know what they were doing?  \"What are all these long dramatic series in here?  This is so boring!  *cut* Eh, they'll get the point.\"\n\nWith all the options out there, I just don't think this is worth your time.

The horror is made in a very very cheap way with imagery that isn't scary, jumpscares that won't scare you and bad special effects.\nThe Pacing is so slow and altogether the movie is very boring. There are many things that do not make any sense and I would have also wanted to see more about the real life stories like the two girls who sacrificed a friend because they believed in slender man. Another big thing that comes to mind is the way the sequences are filmed. Every scene is shot in such a choppy way.\n\nAltogether Slender Man just bored the sh*t out of me and it didn‘t scare me either.\nBUT, if you wanna get drunk with a bunch of your friends I see that you could find some enjoyment in this movie. Otherwise I don't recommend it at all.\nI can't give this movie an honest rating by the way because there's now 0/5 on Rotten Tomatoes. LOL",

Really just take the concepts you see in something like Sinister, and add the creepiness of films like Ouija 2 and you're set.  What Slender Man should have done is been one of those films that plays on technological fears and senses of paranoia, and used it's scares with subtlety.  There's a new brand of horror a lot of films do now where there will just be something in the background, and they won't dwell on it, it'll just be there.  Maybe you'll see it, maybe you won't, and that's what's creepy about it.  That's perfect for Slender Man, that's really what was creepy about him in those original images that made him popular in the first place.  And at times, this movie almost does that.  The weird thing is there are glimpses of what could be a good movie in here, like the director knew what made Slender Man scary but then the studio said \"no, more jumps scares, more Sony product placement\", and now here we are, just another cheap teen horror movie like every teen horror movie.  Literally this is just another teen horror movie, it's got all the ingredients of one: over the top acting, jumbled editing, big CGI jump scares, Joey King screaming at things, all the ingredients.  It's so frustrating because Slender Man is one of our modern monsters and he is a good one and he can be so scary, but this movie doesn't know what makes him scary.

This movie isn't the so-bad-it's-good kind; it's very much the opposite. I wasn't entertained at all. The best thing this movie had was the titular antagonist, the internet phenomenon that is Slender Man. Even years after it stopped being relevant it still posessed a certain creepiness factor. And yet he was heavily underutilised, appearing in the flesh in only a couple of scenes. He mostly infulences the protagonists psychologically through dream sequences or some hallucionatinons but rarely do we see him actually doing something. It's merely implied and that is a big misstep. The movie is also filled with sequences that obviously lead to a jumpscare of some kind and there one can see the lack of creativity behind the scenes. The actors don't do the film any favors as well. They try their best, in particular Joey King, with the script they are given but it doesn't seem to work. The characters just aren't compelling at all. That along with the very incoherent plot make the film almost unwatchable. For the first, say, 15 minutes I was actually thinking that it wasn't that bad but after the first girl that disappears everything just goes downhill. I'd say there are a few solid creepy scenes in the film that showcase what it potentially could have been but it just seems incompetent at what it's trying to do in this final form.

Also, it somehow fails to meet even the criteria of a film genre that has already relegated itself to lower than substandard expectations. Month by month we see shitty jump-scare horrors all as indistinguishable from one to the next, promising some transient thrills with boring, boring, BANG dynamics. Yet it not only fails to tell a compelling story in any regard to its ill-timed and criminally (literally) insensitive boogieman, but it also fails to deliver in the already lazy formula it is reliant upon. It's an utter waste of scream queen Annalise Basso who goes missing within the first 15 minutes despite her being the actress with the most credentials. Joey King of The Kissing Booth takes center stage and does her best (which isn't all that great) with the anachronistic dialogue written by a 50 year old man trying his best to capture the spirit of high school aged girls.",

It takes them weeks for them to find out that the oh-so-scary slender man got her.\n\nThe story was stale. Why do you decide to take the point of view of a few high school girls? Why not something a LITTLE more interesting? Like a parent investigating their high schoolerâ(TM)s disappearance?\n\nThe CGI...sweet Jesus...Sony, it is 2018...\n\nThe actual movie is dark. No, I mean, literally dark. If the lights are turned off in a room, or if it is nighttime in the woods, you can barely make out anything that you are seeing, unless you watch an edited version of the film, which I seriously doubt someone would waste their time editing this hollow catastrophe - if you deleted the bad scenes in this movie, and only leaves the good ones, we would have the very first film that only featured end credits, only we would not, since there would not be a movie in that case, WHICH IS WHAT WE REALLY NEED!!!!\n\nSome things are just...STUPID!

They bring blindfolds so they do not accidentally look him in the eye (no - face? No, wait, he does not have a face either...). They put on the blindfolds, AND SECONDS AFTER, ONE OF THE GIRLS TAKES OFF THEIR BLINDFOLD WTF WHY IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST WOULD YOU TAKE OFF THE BLINDFOLD WHAT COULD YOU POSSIBLY GAIN FROM TAKING OFF THE BLINDFOLD INSANITY THATS WHAT YOU THICC ;) INDIVIDUAL!!!\n\nWas there anything good about this movie? Yeah, the cinematography - the camera position are good and creepy. But that is IT. NOTHING ELSE.\n\n0% fresh. I would guzzle gasoline then inhale a Zippo before I watch this dull, dull movie ever again. It is so bad up to the point that it actually feels unfinished, but maybe it is not.

It presents an eerie atmosphere, as the majority of the scenes are shot at night with dark lit rooms, fog slowly creeping in the background, and ventures into the deep unforgiving woods that forces us to constantly scan the background for a shadowy figure. The acting is sufficient, I thought Julia Goldani Telles stood out and played this role quite well. With all of this going for Slender Man, its main downfall is that it lacks a fluid story that captivates its audiences. The pacing is erratic throughout the film, characters are so busy that I was never able to connect with any of them. Despite some nice visuals and tense moments, the main villain Slender Man also fails to be scary, he comes across as a generic boogeyman that we never really learn much about. Overall, I didn't think this was a bad horror film, it definitely has certain qualities about it that passes as watchable, but I feel like a much better movie is somewhere deep in those woods.",

They do a Google search for Slender Man, summon him like fools, and now they have to try to survive.  Now I do actually do like the lore of Slender Man... to an extent.  In a sense, it is the internet's version of a campfire story.  I think it's a fun to look for him in the background of pictures online, and I do enjoy playing the video games, as simple as they may be.  That said, I can sniff out a turkey pretty far in advance, and there was no real reason for this movie to be put into existence.  The mystique is largely what makes this character as effective as he is, so why are they making a narrative focused on learning more about him?  This was about as terrible as I was expecting, and may God help you if you were excited for this.  Right out of the gates, this starts off on the wrong foot with these girls.  They don't talk like natural people, they talk more like how adults think teens talk, and it is awkward.  It is not helped by the fact that these girls aren't the best of actors, which is hindered even further because nobody in this makes logical choices.  Not to get into spoiler territory (I just know there are people out there that don't want Slender Man spoiled for them), but there are way too many points where you will audibly talk to the screen, asking hard-hitting questions like: \"why don't you go to the cops?\" or, \"why don't you talk to an adult?\"  This is a folly of many a horror movie but here, it is considerably worse because it is so noticeable.  To further exacerbate things, in the smack dab middle of when these girls are dealing with Slender Man, they take a break to bicker about boys.  Why?  Because this is written by somebody who does not have a clear understanding of how sensible human beings operate.  I don't think that this is the worst thing in the world, it is just a very poorly conceived horror flick.  It is basic, and when this thing is finally wrapping up, there are way too many dream sequences for you to even start being scared.  They make up the rules as they go along, so much so that the rules in this universe aren't clearly defined enough so that you feel threatened.  It gets tedious with the amount of research they do on computers, and there is even bad lighting to boot.  Yeah, this is a big time waste of your time.",

A tall, faceless, and long arms mysterious being does sound creepy when it is lurking in the forests, stalking people. The film fails to even being a scary movie. It has everything that fails in its cliché of horror movies. Stupid teens, boring direction that lacks scares and consistent scenes. Lets not forget the plot does feel more like a rip off from The Ring movies. The characters are all bad and lacking in characteristics that you would root for. These teens made the stupid decision to watch a video of a slender man on a website. From there, Slender man is stalking these teens one by one. Luring them into the forest or traumatizing them to the part they go insane. Teens make the stupid decision and it is difficult to even care for them. Also, if it is a plot hole or something. But where are all there parents. They go walking around their homes on a school night, yelling and screaming cause something is coming inside their homes. And no adult supervision is found. Until, one of the kids ends up in a hospital and the parents finally show up out of nowhere. The direction is lacking comprehensive with its storytelling. Characters go missing when one of the girls is trying to reach her boyfriend. You really do not hear back about what happened to him. The acting is dull. Joey King, Julia Goldani Telles, Jaz Sinclair, and Annalise Basso were all tedious with their performance. The script also was lacking in characteristics with their characters. Which made it hard for you to even care for them. The plot was similar to The Ring. Except, they are being stalked by a mysterious tall, skinny, faceless man. It does have some creepy moments. But it fails with its cliché horror storytelling. And the climax and third act gets lazy with its storytelling. That is not even sure how to end the film. With one character going insane in the hospital and decides to face the slender man herself. Overall, Slender Man is a bad film. It lacks scares and suspense. Characters make stupid decisions. Acting is boring. The direction is lazy and the script lacks in fleshing out their characters. Only good thing is Slender Man is kind of creepy.",

My problem is the deleted scenes. I watched as the eye stab from the trailer didn't happen, as the girls just suddenly had the laptop, and we were all left qondering what would happen to that boy. It left me with a bittersweet feeling at the end, because while I did enjoy the movie for what it was, there were obvious pieces in it missing that I was left to fill.

To \"summon him\", you must watch a video and follow the instructions in the video, and when you're done, congratulation, Slender Man is summoned, go and have fun with him!\n3. Slender Man is a good pranker! He made me laugh a lot with his pranks... What's dumber than making a pranker creature in a horror movie?\n\n4. Oh, yeah, the cast was dumber than Slender Man.\n\n5. Slender Man, please, grow up.. stop playing with the trees, it's noisy!!\n\n6. The CGI of Slender Man was like a man with some toilet paper rolled around his face.\n\n7. This message is for the developers of this \"game\", please, fix the glitch of the faces, and the horror-dreaming stuff.\n\n8. One more thing, please, fix the performances too, cause they are bad!\n\n9. The finale.. LOL!\n\n10. And now, the dumbest thing in the movie award goes to... The script! Congrats to the script, it was super-dumb!\n\nWOW, this movie is terribly bad! As I said, it was one of the most anticipated movies of the whole year, but it disappointed me very very much! It easily became one of the worst movies of 2018 -if it's not the worst already-!\n\nOne more thing, why Katie's father thinks that \"people can not just disappear\"? Wake up, MR. There's something called kidnapping, didn't you hear about it?\n\nI think you already know what I'm gonna give this terrible movie, don't you? Yup, it's definitely an F!!\n\nOkay, guys, thank you as always for reading my review, let me know if you like my reviews or not, and I welcome all the comments.",

It turns out to be the opposite of good and truthfully, saying, the GAME itself is much more scarier than this movie itself. I am quite disappointed. but then I am not that surprised anymore - just as did for the Warcraft or Tekken, or DOA, etc ... I think Hollywood should stick to a manuscripts or horror-supernatural book to make their scary movies ... Just my opinion ...",

When Hallie is portrayed as a fast athlete we have no given  proof if she really is because we never see Hallie run around the track; in fact, she slips while she runs away from Slender Man near the end. Hallie decides to give herself to Slender Man to save her sister Lizzie but runs away regardless. Slender Man NEVER RETURNS a captured soul, he ether kills them or given the Slender Sickness which will kill off the victim and he doesn't turn humans into trees! \n\nDo I really have to point out all other flaws? Not worth it. This movie insults Creepypasta fans and is EXTREMELY late of Slender Man's popularity.",

Sadly, though, this movie was not banned and it still even remains in theatres today. \nThis movie would've been watchable in 2012, however in 2018, its lack of substance, or anything that makes it scary, is just bad, and we as an audience would no longer just enjoy the movie because of the character that we all knew and loved back then. \nThe actual slender Man has like arthritis for some reason and so every time he movies it makes this popping sound, it doesn't come off as unsettling, it comes off as \"oh, I would immediately know the location of slender man if he was anywhere near me because he pops like a god-damned chiropractor's office.\" \nSlenderman also has a fetish for trees. I realize that because of Slender: The Eight Pages, the forest has become a big part of the Slenderman lore, and so it's understandable that bits of the movie would take place in the forest, but literally I get the feeling that if this movie was rated NC-17, we would end up with tree tentacle porn.\nThis movie is retarded, and if you watch it, watch it to laugh at it, don't think that it's actually going to be good.",

            "content": "So to put my experience with this movie in context: I have a long history with the Slender Man mythos. I came across some of the Marble Hornets videos back in 2010 or 2011, before the game came out and the character became sort of a meme, and I became obsessed. I poured through every webseries and blog I could find. Searched for forum threads of photoshops and did research on similar historical iconography. I even made my own short film on the subject. The community that was built around this monster was truly fascinating. An instantly recognizable monster whose stories were being built by a disorganized group of horror fans and amateur writers and filmmakers spread out across the internet. It was rapidly evolving modern folklore, and it was really cool to watch. Nearly the whole community seemed to understand what made Slender Man scary, and if they added context or back story, it would always be small and it would always raise more questions. The less you know about him the better. There were no solid rules. Just various accounts of stalking and death. Going back, a lot of this writing is fairly mediocre outside of the bubble of that passionate bunch of people, though some of the stuff still really holds up. One of my prized possessions is the complete series of Marble Hornets on DVD signed by the guys who made it. So with all that being said, I am going to address this film in two different ways: firstly as a film fan, and then as a Slender Man fan.\n\nThis is a very bad movie. Just atrocious. Wow. Do not watch it. Damn the writing is just so godawful. This is a movie about a bunch of teenage girls that was written by a middle-aged man and it is painful to watch. They spout weird dad jokes, and the flow of their conversations is so stilted and weird. They talk about leaving town in only the most generic, general ways. When Slender Man gets brought up, of course one of them has never heard of it, and the rest must explain it to her and the audience. They're all incredibly stupid. There's a scene where they all just have to sit still and wear blindfolds, and because the writing is trite garbage, one of them moronically lifts her blindfold and looks straight at the monster. Dumb. The drunken father of one of the girls breaks into his daughter's friend's house and attacks a couple of children and then is back in his home no problems the next day. Ridiculous. The whole set up and plot is basically a straight rip-off of The Ring. They watch a video, and then they are cursed to be killed by a monster. Plot threads are picked up and dropped almost instantly. There's a very pointed line about one girl having a bunch of trophies, and it's spoken with resentment. It sounds like a line you're supposed to remember but this almost conflict is never brought up again. There is a person feeding them information through the internet whose identity is called into question several times that stops being relevant halfway through the movie and they never address them again. The editing is choppy and the dream sequences are generic. The effects are inconsistent, sometimes they're creepy but usually they're in your face and looking awful. The sound design is full of odd choices. There is a sequence where she hears something downstairs and you hear metal clanking to the floor. This is later revealed to not be the monster, but I couldn't help but imagine Slender Man sneaking through the kitchen and accidentally knocking a pot off a shelf and it made me laugh in the middle of a scene that was supposed to be tense. Some of the cinematography was okay. The actors were alright, they probably would have been good if they had anything to work with, the cast really deserved better.\n\nAnd as a Slender Man fan? What a mess. The writer and the director obviously have no concept of what makes this monster scary. Watching Slender Man videos trains you to watch the background for him. One of the scariest things about the character is seeing him when the protagonist doesn't. In Marble Hornets, the characters would become paranoid about doing things they don't remember and would film themselves when they sleep. Leading to recordings of Slender Man watching them while they lay unconscious. Characters would walk through the woods and you would catch a glimpse of him in the background. It increases the paranoia. He's always watching. In this movie the only time you see Slender Man is when the characters do. It's so blunt force about it. Wouldn't want the audience to miss him. Got to have him front and center. Wouldn't want to leave anything for someone to notice on a second viewing. Well, that's not fair really. I suppose there is one time where we see him and the girls don't; when his shadow sneaks into their room like he's fucking Peter Pan. It looks so stupid, and it's not even consistent with how he normally works. As someone who obsessively researched the Slender lore and got so freaked out by the videos that I would see him out of the corner of my eye next to trees and street poles, I can tell you that just finding the videos is enough to get someone hooked. That's what the community means when they say that he spreads like a virus. You find out about him and you go deeper and deeper and then you share your story and he spreads. Like a disease. The writer of this movie read the virus thing and instead decided to make it that Slender Man is \"a computer virus but for your brain.\" Stupid. Nonsensical. So I suppose he did do some research, they showed a couple of the original Victor Surge images. They have the woodcarving of the skeleton. There's a brief mention of shadow people. But they obviously didn't do much more digging than that. And then there's the videos. They decided to rip off The Ring and make it so that instead of someone just becoming consumed by thoughts of Slender Man after finding videos or blog posts, there's a whole video-based summoning ritual that people do at parties. Sort of a modern Bloody Mary. Then well after that they find all of the drawings that are usually indicative of someone completely corrupted by Slender Man, a \"proxy\" as most people call it. But that doesn't actually make much sense for the character at that point, so it feels more like an element they knew they had to include but didn't know where to include it. All the videos they watch are strangely highly edited, with a whole lot of cuts and music playing over them and circles edited in to point out ol' Slendy, once again they have to point him out every time he's there because subtlety is impossible for this movie and it doesn't trust its audience to pay attention. And all these videos are posted on some deep web site. Why though? There's no violent content. Why are they not on a YouTube style website? You know, like they are in real life? And to cap it all off. Ever wonder what happens to Slender Man's victims after he takes them? Want to know what happens to these mysterious disappearing people? HE TURNS INTO A TREE AND THEN ABSORBS THEM INTO HIS TRUNK I GUESS.\n\nOKAY. SURE. WHY NOT? FUCK IT.\n\nIt's just such a waste of a good monster. Slender Man can be terrifying, Marble Hornets frightened me more than any other horror media back when I first found it. But this movie is not remotely scary. Slender Man can be fascinating, finding all the little clues strewn about writing by dozens of different creators made me feel like I was uncovering some great secret. But the lore in this movie is so blunt force and expository it doesn't spur any curiosity. And ultimately, Slender Man can be great metaphor. He's been used as a way of addressing child abductions, self-medicating, our broken medical system, emotional isolation, mental illness, and fear of the wilderness. In this movie he is just a generic monster in a generic monster movie. He's the Bye Bye Man. He's Annabelle. He's It Follows, but shitty. Don't watch this movie. It's not a good movie.",

I feel this movie has not represent the growth of the slender man lore.",

I am sorry to Joey King because she does not deserve to be in such a mediocre film. Horrendous cinematography, choppy editing, the horror heavily relies on silly jump scares and on hilarious close-ups, and the screenplay is a lazy exposition party. Compared to other horror movies of 2018, this one looks like a Disney fairytale. That says it all.\"",

            "content": "My first encounter with Slender Man was with the freeware online game, Slender: The Eight Pages, that went viral back in 2012 scaring the bejesus out of everyone that played it. Actually, what dared me to play the game was the YouTube videos of people playing Slender, watching their reactions of nervous laughter and all out fear. So, this meant I went into the screening assuming this was a horror flick based on the phenomenal game, but sadly no, and as was exiting the cinema accusing the production team of not even having played the game, disrespecting it’s source material or totally missing out on some great potential. But, after a little research, I discover that the game itself was based on a recent folklore meme created by Eric Knudsen (credited as his pseudonym Victor Surge) back in 2009. It’s apart of this creepypasta movement that exploded via internet forums and chain letter style emails with copy and pasted (Hence the origin of creepypasta) images of folklore legends, many of which relating to ancient urban myths and horror stories. This being a competition to who could create the best paranormal images and so Slender Man was born in the Internet. I also discover that this isn’t the first film to feature Slender Man with an American found footage film Always Watching: A Marble Hornets Story which starred the famed, lanky and gaunt Doug Jones back in 2015. And there’s a number of smaller independent films and shorts based on Slender Man. I’ve yet to watch any of these films so it’s impossible for me to make any fair comparisons. So, I went in expecting a film based on the computer game and sadly was greeting with something totally uninspiring and unrelating apart from the scary no-faced character. But does knowing this might not have been inspired by the game make this film any better or forgivable? Hell, no! As a stand alone horror, it’s terribly executed and unoriginal, snatching bits from other horrors like The Ring in terms of myth and more recently the Autopsy of Jane Doe in terms of imagery. So, four girls hear about a scary video that claims to have some connection to children’s disappearances across the globe and so, they dare themselves to watch it during a sleepover, inviting a dark and sinister entity into their lives, the Slender Man. An urban legend that abducts children or sends them crazy with continually hauntings and nightmares. It’s a basic story which needn’t be trashed with poor performances or poor editing. I’m partly in conflict as to which owes more to the failure of this film, because their performances are no way aided by the obvious chopped up ending which would have an effect on the entire film. The trailers clearly indicates the film had some serious re-edits with so many loose ends that they couldn’t have been simply forgot about, because there’s some screenshots that hint at more of some of the character’s unfinished stories. But then I read about the controversy that spooked studios and distribution about promoting and even releasing the film. The Waukesha stabbing in 2014 where two 12year old girls stabbed a fellow classmate apparently to appease Slender Man and out of fear of him killing their families if they did not comply. When this film was announced, one of the fathers of the girls who committed the stabbing, urged local cinemas to refrain from showing the film, calling it “extremely distasteful” And this isn’t an isolated incident, there has been a number of acts of adolescent violence spurred on by the Slender Man myth. But ignoring the controversy, the film is poorly made and is not a good representation for director Sylvain White’s relatively small filmography. It’s super clichéd with bad plot lines, poorly acted and has such a weak script, and even weaker scares. The script and story are just plain stupid most of the time, again maybe owing a lot to bad edits, but no one would venture into dark woods, or walk the street alone at night when under threat. The imagery isn’t that terrible, trippy and subliminal at times but it’s nothing new and isn’t enough to save the film at all. Considering the amount of source material there is, and for me, just coming from the game; there’s so much potential that got sadly wasted and missed that makes me believe I could make a better Slender Man movie. Only thing I thought suited the film was some of the sounds, the tolling bells and the looming hum. This film is begging for a spoof, especially when one character prematurely expresses his sex face. It’s just one of the worse horrors I’ve seen lately, it’s one of the worse films I’ve ever seen.

But so what? I mean if anything, I did this backwards. I felt like this is the kind of movie that I'd have to be intoxicated to watch, but I feel really mean saying that...so, let's not say that! Instead, let's just say that this is definitely one of the worst movies I've seen this year. \n\nI don't really know where to start and I don't want to spend much time on this but let's get started. The screenplay is probably the worst thing about this film. I can tell this is the kind of film that was pushed out really quickly to make bank, but it came out a few years too late. This screenplay didn't really have a beginning, middle and end. The characters weren't given any distinctive quality traits that separated them from one another. There were obviously a couple of cool ideas here but it was just so rushed. It was an hour and a half but it flew by like a bullet. \n\nThe other problem was that this film was mostly written in post. Most of its intense, 'scary' scenes were rapidly cut together and paired with bright flashing lights, iffy sound design, and lackluster animation. I felt like the editors were trying to sculpt something out of nothing and it just wasn't there. It sucks because the actors weren't too bad but this film tried to make scares out of nothing. \n\nTo be honest I'd rather get back to drinking so I'm going to cut this review short. I normally write reviews to help myself become a better writer but I don't feel the need to elaborate more on this. Cheers!",

Maybe seven or eight years ago, definitely not several years after the tendrilled, blank-faced figure hit peak popularity, and definitely not after a poor girl was assaulted by two impressionable young girls in his name only four years back. Well, here's Slender Man now, a terrible movie adaptation of an already worn premise that's torturous to watch in every single way imaginable.\nYou know exactly what kind of movie you're in for within the first few dialogues of Slender Man. The four \"teenage\" girls speak like they're forty-year-old men reciting their best Generation Z impressions, all while giving the spooky trees surrounding them a solid run contending for the film's most wooden performances. Lead character Hallie (Julia Goldani Telles) is an especially boring black hole of charisma that's impossibly hard to root for given her next-level stupidity and complete void of personality.\nWhere there's no logic in Slender Man's character development (which it doesn't really have to begin with), there's even less in its titular big bad. With the abilities to appear in dreams/visions, manipulate tree trunks and tree branches (?), as well as haunt social medias in a shameless rip-off of The Ring, none of the Slender Man's powers have any sort of correlation, sense, or palpable installation of fear. Also, he's got tentacles.\nReally, unless you're thirteen years old and on some early 2010's scene, there's nothing scary about a very tall man without a face wearing a ([n] admittedly dapper) business suit. Apart from some truly horrid VFX more than a notch below the quality of a student film, the only frights arrive by way of the cheapest of the most leading of choreographed of jump scares harbored in inappropriately messy, nonsensible horror sequences.\nPerhaps the most insulting part of Slender Man is the moral haphazardly slapped onto the epilogue. In a tasteless attempt at justifying its controversial existence, the film's closing monologue involves a character describing Slender Man's true powers as a virus preying on curiosity, specifically online obsession. It's an obvious nod to the 2014 tragedy in which two girls stabbed their friend to near death as an offering for the fictional online creation, but it's downright offensive the film thinks it has something important to say.\nWith awful acting, writing, directing, storytelling, and every other imaginable aspect that goes into movie-making, Slender Man is a film that lands dead on arrival. There's not even a trace of ironic fun to be had with it.",

            "content": "Slender Man is based off online stories about the titular supernatural being whose fame was born 9 years ago and died about as far back. In the film, a group of girls decide to summon the Slender Man to prove he doesn't exist, but when one of them disappears all hell breaks loose. \n\n\n\nFind a comfy seat, settle in, and try not to fall asleep as Slender Man is so thin there's barely enough substance to keep you awake. Nothing about this past the 15 minute mark is at all engaging. It starts off quite well where it does a fine job introducing its protagonists, setting up the legend behind the Slender Man character, and had me keen to see where it ends up heading. But where it goes isn't scary, suspenseful, or even barely interesting... it's a straight up bore and going into the third act I was fighting to stay awake. It progresses so agonisingly slow and the occasional attempt at a horror sequence rips away any suspense as oppose to introducing it. There really isn't much variety to the horror sequences either, one or two moments are unique in that they're not going straight for the jump-scare but rather the presence of something creepy in the background.\n\nAs time goes on and the Slender Man starts becoming more physically involved in the horror sequences it becomes even less scary. It's one of those situations in horror where I feel like a less-is-more approach would have worked much better in generating scares. Any time it looked like it was starting to build suspense it completely ruins it with a predictably timed jump-scare or by simply showing the Slender Man which completely took me out of the film every time.\n\n\n\nI want to highlight the editing here which is at times absolutely shocking and also the basic progression of the story that at times didn't make sense from scene to scene. Some of the editing and scene transitions are noticeably dreadful and jarring to the point where I couldn't tell what I was watching in some action/horror sequences because of jarring rapid cuts. And it's not just the editing within sequences that's awful, it genuinely feels like at times entire scenes are missing as it cuts from one location to the next and I'm straight up lost. For instance, as I mentioned in the premise a girl goes missing, when this happens in the movie one second it's day time and she's there and then in literally the next scene it's late afternoon and she's now missing. It took me a bit of time to gather what had happened and it's not the only transition that is dreadfully executed. And then I did a bit of research and found that Bloody Disgusting is reporting that major scenes were cut from the film by Sony/Screen Gems in fear of backlash to their gruesome nature. \n\n\n\nAs far as the performances go, none of them really stand out as being any good. The four lead teens are played by Joey King, Annalise Basso, Julia Goldani Telles, and Jaz Sinclair and none of them really make an impact. Annalise Basso is the one I'm most familiar with as she was great in both Captain Fantastic (2016) and Ouija: Origin of Evil (2016). However she really isn't given much to do and I'd say is wasted in the story. Joey King I didn't really enjoy in here, she didn't really sell me on the situations her character was in, and this only adds to her questionable year with her role in Netflix's The Kissing Booth which isn't good in the traditional sense. Julia Goldani Telles I'd say contributes the most to the film in that I found her character at the very least slightly engaging and at times was rooting for her specifically to succeed. She sold me the most on the horror of some sequences so I guess there's one positive. \n\n\n\nI wouldn't suggest Slender Man to anyone, even if you were a fan of the legend 8 years ago this doesn't offer much content to scare you and is ultimately severely disappointing. There's a real lack of suspense and terror in the film with only the first 15 minutes being effective and a very small handful of scenes that followed actually bearing a tense nature. Watching this is a waste of time, time that could be spent towards an actually good horror movie that'll scare you as oppose to putting you to sleep. \n\n2.9/10",

When you caught a glimpse you knew you're time was limited  and you ultimately only saw him for maybe a second or two.  You saw slemderman ENTIERLY TOO MUCH!  Anyway, this was on of the only horror movies I wanted to see in a theater because I thought it would make it scarier and it probably did.",

Not only is the source material as tired as a sick old dog the execution of a potentially entertaining film limps along with savage apathy. There are too many weaknesses to point out in a mere review on RT so here are the reasons you should not waste your time with this one (even ironically).  1st reason no love was put into this film from the camera work to the acting it felt so lifeless and sad.  2nd the story is one we all know so why not try to be unpredictable with it, like maybe this could've been some good satire but they went with the most generic of narratives.  3rd the audience had no reaction and usually in even the most jaded of horror flicks there are some startled shouts; in the full auditorium i was in not even a gasp but there were a few chuckles.  4th and final its rated pg-13 and given the direction it was trying to go in maybe a little gore could have broken up the monotony or at least some shocking imagery but all the had was some vague badly CGIed spooks, I am not saying a horror film must be R to be scary or well done but with this movie it would have helped immensely given the whole film was the motion picture equivalent of click bait.

Wow this was a terrible movie. I never expected much in the first place. When they first announced that the movie would be made I thought maybe they could make a decent horror movie out of it. Then the first trailer arrived. It was a bunch of random creepy images and didn’t even involve Slender Man at all. That’s when I knew it would receive horrible reviews. It currently has an 11% on Rotten Tomatoes, 29 on Metascore, and 3/10 on IMDb. The plot was horrible. Very predictable, a bunch of jump scares, stupid decisions, and many laughable moments. The cast was horrible except for Annalise Basso, who is actually a good actress. But the order of disappearances for the girls goes from best actress to worst actress. Because of that the whole ending was so painful to watch. It was pretty funny to watch. The last 5ish minutes was hilarious. Because I don’t care I’m going to spoil it. The girl we’re left with is freaking out because of everything that’s been happening so she goes to the woods to give her life to Slender Man so it can all end. When Slender Man goes in to full monster mode to take her she runs away screaming. Like a few seconds ago she wanted to give her life. Another hilarious moment with that girl is there’s a part where she goes over to this one guy’s house and they’re about to have sex. She looks at his face and it’s violently shaking with a smile and the room is spinning and she’s screaming. It was one of the funniest scenes in a movie I’ve seen all year. The last dumb scene I’ll talk about came earlier in the movie. Annalise (the good actress) went missing and the three girls go into the woods at night to get rid of something they love as a sacrifice to Slender Man so they can get her back. The girls are supposed to be blindfolded and not to look because if they see his face they’ll be messed up forever. Of course one of the girls gets scared so she takes off her blindfolds and sees him, which had horrible effects and looked dumb. Then it’s just a bunch of screaming and tripping through the woods followed by fake jump scares. There is not much good I can say about the movie. The only things are that Annalise was a good actress for the 15 minutes she was in the movie and there was maybe two instances where it was sort of creepy. Honestly it could’ve been a good movie if they did a plot similar to the video game, like a found footage thing with the plot of the game. Instead we got some funny jumbled movie with bad acting from Julia Goldani Telles and Joey King (who has been in horrible horror movies recently). This movie is going to win some Razzie Awards for sure. Don’t see it. Don’t waste your money. If you want to watch laughable horror film then this is the movie for you. My Grade: D",

I have to say, the only thing that \"scared\" me was the noise and music build up to the jumpscares, but once you get into the rhythm of the movie it's not scary at all, because you expect the jumpscares, and that's really the only scary thing this movie has got going for it. One of the other issues I had was the lighting. I understand it's supposed to be a dark, scary movie with silhouettes and shadows, but some sets were so dark that you couldn't see what was actually happening. The other lighting extreme was when a character would be walking in a dark place and suddenly shine their LED phone torch right down the barrel of the camera. If the effect of this was to temporarily blind you, then it's spot on.\nA few things in this movie actually made me laugh, like some of the scenes, acting, and a couple of the jump scares even made me giggle.\nThe only good thing about this movie was the camera work. There were parts of the movie where characters were experiencing hallucinations and nausea, and the camera work did an excellent job of portraying that feeling to the audience. Apart from that, it is not worth the cost of pop corn and tickets.\nOverall, this movie is boring, cringey, too long, and uneventful. The acting, although hilarious at times, was unconvincing. I recommend saving your money and skipping this \"horror\" movie.",

I went to the movie with my girlfriend, and we spent the whole movie, along with the rest of the audience, laughing at the CGI in the \"scary\" scenes and groaning at the \"character development\" scenes. It was a cringy mess. If you've seen The Ring, (A great movie by the way, would absolutely recommend) than you've seen this movie. They did not go off of source material at all except for the way Slender Man looks. This movie could be so much better if only Sony had hired/compared some people who worked on the Slenderman games and original stories. Especially the guys of Marble Hornets. This movie had 20 thousand times the budget of Marble Hornets, but that series is 20 thousand times better. Characters: 2/10. Bland, boring, but the acting was passable. Source material: 2/10. They got Slenderman's look right. CGI: 1/10. The dog from Bye Bye Man, the cats from Catwoman, hell, the Amazing Bulk looks better. \nMovie theatre atmoshpere: 7/10. Had a blast laughing at the movie with everyone. Everyone had a good time for all the wrong reasons. This movie makes you feel comfortable, the last thing a horror movie wants to do. Scares: 2/10.

Of course I had to re-watch it which was horrible.\n\nThere's nothing redeemable or anything good about 'Slender Man'. The script is terrible with endless amount of horror movie clichés you thought died out for good. The cliché of how teenagers talk in these type of horror movies. Not forgetting the questionable decisions that leads to their demise.\n\nAll the performances were pretty bad and not convincing during the more \"scary\" elements - Just made the scenes more funny to be honest. Joey King is on a winning streak recently by starring in terrible movies, and she's really bad in the movie.\n\nThe atmosphere or tension is none existent to build up any suspense, just loud jump scares through out. Most of the quiet scenes felt like filler than anything else. When it tries to be creepy, it's embarrassing.\n\nOverall rating: Sony, YOU HACKS!",

            "content": "Just to preface, I don't feel good about criticizing Slender Man. It feels like telling a kindergartener that their fingerpainting is lazy and derivative. I wasn't expecting too much going into this movie. And within the first 10 minutes, I gathered enough to know that the movie didn't want you to expect much of it, either. I like to lump movies like this into a category I call Sleepover Horror, along with recent gems like Bye Bye Man, Wish Upon, and Truth or Dare. Sleepover Horror does not hold itself to very high standards and asks that audiences do the same. The only standard is that it must be PG-13, catering to young adolescents who want to be spooked with their friends under a pile of blankets on the couch on Saturday night. To be frank, I have a soft spot for these kinds of movies. My first forays into horror were films just like these from a previous era (circa The Grudge). And when you're 13, you don't know or care that they're mediocre; they deliver what you and your friends want. So I would never grade Slender Man with the same rubric as something like Hereditary. Apples and oranges.\n\nBut even the nostalgia of my younger years couldn't redeem this failed attempt at movie making. I actually think it started out fairly promising. The premise was good enough, the characters were good enough, and the atmospheric tension was good enough (also, props to Joey King for acting her heart out no matter what script she's handed). For me, the biggest stake in the heart of this movie was pacing. When we're dealing with Sleepover Horror, I can forgive a lot: bad acting, ridiculous dialogue, painful plot contrivances, exposition through text messages, etc. But I can't forgive boredom, which Slender Man dished out in full service. I was along for the ride until Hallie's date with Tom: perfectly fine scene, but I have no recollection of what happened after that. I blacked out. I can't remember anything, because nothing in the following scenes made any sense plot-wise and therefore blurred together in a feverish attempt to mimic \"The Ring.\" I came to around the part where Wren's trying to jump out her window for some reason, but by that point, I was no longer invested. If Slender Man had shaved 15 minutes off of its runtime and trimmed some of its fat, I think I might have held out until the end. It was a 90-minute movie that felt much, much longer.\n\nNot to pile more dirt on its grave, but I have a list of other minor issues with Slender Man that I want to get off my chest:\n\nI don't even know if the writer's originally planned this script with Slender Man in mind as the Big Bad. The fact that it's called Slender Man is totally meaningless; the film barely addresses any of his lore. It may as well have been called Spooky Steve, or Creepy Creeper, or Bye Bye Man 2. If you're going to make a movie specifically about Slender Man, you should probably draw upon what made him creepy in the first place. Like how he's always stoically planted in the background; he never moves and you never see him up close. That shit can be really effective for spooks (see \"Courage the Cowardly Dog\" episode with Ramses and the slab). As soon as we see him up close, he's robbed of his power. He seemed like a ripoff of the Crooked Man from Conjuring 2, both in the way he looked and moved.\n\nNot to harp on the mythos, but didn't they explicitly mention that Slender Man has the power to hypnotize his victims and lure them in? That seemed to work with Katie, but the other girls were lure-proof. They kept screaming and running away. Hallie even has a weird moment at the end where she's like \"Take me, sir. I'm ready to die\" and then immediately changes her mind and bolts.\n\nWhy did the nurses in the hospital wear old-timey uniforms?\n\nThis movie has a real lighting problem. Most of it is in so much shadow that you can't see the actors' faces (intentional?), and then it'll suddenly cut to, like, the surface of the sun. For viewers in a dark theater, this was torture (and it happened about every 5 minutes). Like in the woods scene, when they have flashlights and then shine their lights right into the camera and it feels like you're in a dentist's chair.\n\nThey couldn't decide who it's protagonist was. My vote would be for the younger sister Lizzy since she gets a great little voiceover at the end that attempts to tie things together with the final word \"ya know?\"\n\nHallie is always mentioning she has track practice but never goes to track practice. What are you hiding, Hallie?\n\nHallie's family dinner is really quiet, dark, and awkward. I hate when movies do this. Hereditary did it too, but it had the excuse that a huge tragedy had just occurred. Wouldn't you at least want to turn on a few lights and play some light dinner jazz?\n\nObligatory library research scene. Why was Wren there? She was just using the computer; does she not have one of those at home? Also, I really wanted to the librarian to play a more central role, like in Bye Bye Man.\n\nI think the director was trying to imitate The Ring with all the fog and bluish tones, but I was getting some heavy Twilight vibes, especially with all the forest scenes. I was waiting for a sexually charged scene between Hallie and Slender Man where she's like, \"How old are you?\" and \"How long have you been 17?\"",

Before going to see this film, I had already predicted that it would be some cheesy and atrocious film rendition of the game Slender Man. Needless to say, my prediction was spot on. First of all, the timing for the release of this movie is way off. The movie should've been released when the urban legend of Slender Man was in its prime. Other than that, the story was extremely boring, cliche, and often times very predictable. Another cliche aspect of the film were its \"horror\" features. Slender Man was riddled with predictable jump scares and little to no psychological aspects. There were only a couple parts that truly scared me. When it came to the atmosphere, the film was okay at best. The dark and foggy forest, Slender Man's home, was truly creepy. This was partly complemented by the sound design including the blowing of leaves and the creaking of branches. However, these scenes still didn't make up for the atrocious overuse of jump scares. Another thing I was disappointed with was the acting. It wasn't the worst in the world, but it certainly wasn't great. Acting is really supposed to sell the plot to the viewer and make the movie more interesting, but the acting in this movie didn't appeal to me or make the movie's already boring plot interesting. It lacked substance and didn't really make the characters memorable. Speaking of characters, the character development in this film was awful. The four main characters were just your typical high school girls seeking adventure. As I've said before, there is nothing memorable about these characters. Lastly, I'd like to touch upon the editing. Everything was fine except the CGI. The CGI was horrendous and made the movie much worse than it already was. A simple solution to this would be to show the main villain less. Reason being because it wouldn't showcase the limited CGI effects and also introduce a more eerie, psychological horror-type aspect into the movie. Great horror flicks like The Blair Witch Project (1999) have done this and I don't see why this film can't. Overall, I believe this movie was outdated for its time, boring, predictable, and simply just a bad movie.",

They did the best they could with what they had, (a randomized jump scare, gross-out, with predictability) containing typical teenage reference to social media.  Come on Sony....You can do better.",

Other horror films with the family friendlier rating have proven effective at offering thrills and chills without tons of violence or gore (such as Poltergeist, Truth or Dare, and A Quiet Place) so please don't blame the MPAA rating for this film's faults.\n\nI think what ultimately killed Slenderman was the studio and the distributor's fear of OFFENDING a society that THRIVES ON BEING OFFENDED. Naturally, the people that might take offense wouldn't watch it anyway, so it is the audience that ultimately pays the price. 2018 is the year of \"finding something to be offended by\", and the film's backers fell into this societal fad. \n\nI sincerely hope horror's recent return to the mainstream isn't further strangled by the \"hashtag\" society of prudes and wannabe victims that have pulverized the entertainment industry to the point where every movie and TV show feels like a political advertisement. \n\nBottom line: Wait for an unrated home video release for this one...If there is one.",

They had so much potential to be utilized with slender man, but made so many horrible choices with the liberties taken on the Lore. The acting borders from, “ok” to “shamefully bad”, and the script was just horrendous. It’s so all over the place, and the potholes grow larger every minute. The film also suffers from trying to stay tame in order to keep the rating safe for kids to be able to attend. It goes so far down the safety hole that it’s almost more PG than PG-13. There’s no gore, sex, or nudity. The only thing I can think of to maybe justify Pg-13 over PG is that one kid says, “fuck” once. (They say “frick” other times... seriously) it’s just way too timid, and it borders on being flat out boring. The often beautiful shots (when they’re not raped by hideously cheap CGI) and fantastic soundtrack are all that kept me from passing out into a boredom induced coma. They repeatedly try for the cliche jump scares, but you see them a mile off. It just fails on so many levels, and it’s frustrating because at the root of it all, they really could’ve made something brilliant if they hadn’t succumbed to being lazy, safe, and cliche. I’d say a generous 4 out of 10 (i hate 5 star ratings)and only for the cinematography and score which really are wasted on a turd of a film. The rest is just a sloppy mess. ",

The creepy fiction inspired two adolescent girls to complete an act of ruthless violence that was more terrifying than any story. A quick search of the character reveals numerous accounts of the way this 21st-century boogie man abducts children. These stories are often accompanied with photoshopped images of the figure throughout history, adding to the mystery and allure of the character. \n\nIt was only a matter of time before Hollywood would try to profit off of the character, so naturally, this Slender Man film was born. The film follows a group of high school students who accidentally summon Slender Man into their world. They watch a bizarre internet video filled with spooky shots of forests, pagan looking symbols, and otherworldly bells. Honestly, this reminded me of the VHS tape that is played in The Ring. A week later, one of the girls goes missing, and the rest of the group must face the Slender Man to try to get her back. \n\nFor being based upon a character that has inspired so much imagined and real-life horror, Slender Man the movie isn't very scary. The film is plagued by horror movie cliche after cliche and an ending that was so inevitably mundane that I left the theater wondering why I had even bothered. Save for the wonderfully atmospheric shots and creepy forest settings, there really aren't many redeeming qualities to the film. We see this CGI monster far too often for us to really be scared of the unknown of it. Instead of getting behind the characters as they try to investigate the mythology and motivation of the Slender Man, I spent more time rolling my eyes at their terrible judgment and cringe-worthy dialogue.  There was a real opportunity to craft a modern horror classic based upon what is arguably one of the most terrifying spooks in recent years. What we get instead is a boring and uninspired movie that will have even the most die-hard horror fans wishing they had kept Slender Man away from the big screen.",

The Slender Man is no different. I am in my mid-twenties and, from what I can remember, I first heard about the Slender Man phenomenon around my junior year of high school (2011). At the time, my younger middle school-aged brother was the type of kid that couldn’t watch even the tamest horror movie without pissing himself. Some of his friends at school had told him about a tall guy with no face that would kidnap you if you stayed out too late (I’m paraphrasing). One night when we were leaving the local rec center, not even 500 yards from our front door, he downright demanded that we call our mom to get a ride home because, in his words, “It’s too dark out. The Slender Man could come get us on the way.” This was, to me, the dumbest thing I had heard out of his mouth in a while, but I asked for details and he told me what he knew. I thought that this sounded like a cool story. Some supernatural tall guy that comes outta nowhere and steals kids during the night? I’m in. A movie based on this story could go one of a hundred different directions. They could have gone the ultra out-there route and had the Slender Man end up being an alien abducting people (The Fourth Kind, anyone?). They could have made a found footage movie (for less money), also in the woods, similar to the storyline we got, but in a more grounded way with way less computer and phone screen exposition. What did we get, you ask? (this is the part where you get my actual review) We got a 90-minute sequence of teenage girls looking back and forth from each other to their (Sony) phone/computer screens followed by 45 minutes of a CGI tree monster facetiming people before ultimately kidnapping them. There are some decent attempts at fear-inducing imagery early on in the film, many of which were heavily influenced by (read “ripped off of”) the Ring franchise, but nothing we haven’t seen done before, better. Character development is almost non-existent. We know one girl’s dad is an alcoholic (though it never plays into the plot) and another girl runs/ran track. That is the extent of an attempt made at fleshing out any of the characters in this movie. Many of the sequences taking place in old buildings or in the woods used sound to their advantage and were definitely high points in the theater experience. The notion that something might sneak up behind you after a crunching of leaves or creaking of floorboards is a whole hell of a lot more relatable and frightening than much of the on-screen CGI-heavy visuals in the final act. The ending of the movie, which I will not spoil here for those of you who have been waiting your whole lives for a Slender Man feature film, was one of the most rushed, laziest endings I have seen in a very long time. This leaves the viewer annoyed and ultimately willing to forget any of the slightly more positive areas of the experience in favor of remembering the movie for what it is; a forgettable throw-away with a solid concept wasted on bad storytelling, mediocre acting, and a closing sequence that would drop a student film a whole letter grade.

(This film has only been out for a day and I don't see it staying in theaters for more than a month.)\n\nAnd now for the actual movie. The acting isn't too horrible, but that's not even the main issue. Any frightening characteristics still associated with our old pal Slendy are now gone. Rather than have our sharp-dressed antagonist be a horrifying, rarely-seen stalker that watches you from afar, they've made him into a physically destructive, confrontational, borderline-slasher villain, like a paranormal Michael Myers. Other than his trademark suit, nothing about this movie truly says SLENDER MAN. Not even the infamous circle-and-X logo makes an appearance. Even Slendy's edgy fanboy Masky is absent. (Fans of the \"Marble Hornets\" franchise will understand.)\n\nSpeaking of which, if you want a more effective and unsettling picture about this jaded internet meme, go watch the \"Marble Hornets\" videos on YouTube. The 2015 feature-length spin-off \"Always Watching\" is almost as bad as the 2018 film, so pick your poison, dear viewer.\n\nIn conclusion, getting murdered by Slendy would've been far less painful than this 93-minute embarrassment of moving pictures.",

And the one that spawned this film is one of the first & best!\n\nSLENDER MAN.\n\nThis particular tale started out as a short story on the net. From there, it blossomed into a national phenomenon, in good ways, & bad. Does this film do ol' Slendy justice? I would say....a little, but not fully.\n\nDespite being 1 & a half hours long, it felt a lot longer, it crept along at a snails pace which, I'm sorry to say, hurt the film overall. There were good parts, to be sure, but it took FOREVER to get to them! The film's atmosphere was that of a modern gothic mystery, but then it de-evolved into a cliché slasher flick without the boobs or gore!\n\nThe cast did well with what they were given which, sadly, wasn't much. I did believe they were a group of semi-misfit teens who messed with something they didn't fully understand till it was too late. I just wish these young starlets had been given better material, better direction....really, just a better movie. They were given half a can of corn starch & 3 packets of hot sauce & told to make a meal, & they managed to make something at least edible.\n\nThe effects were fine, but not enough to save the film. Slendy looked as he was supposed to, & there were parts where reality was distorted in a way that made you question what you were seeing.\n\nThe music was generic, but harmless. The sound effects were a good blend of harsh tones & white noise meant to disorient & set your jaw on edge so you didn't know what to expect, it was a moderate high point.\n\nSadly, I can't recommend Slender Man to any hard core Slendy fans. All the elements are there, but there's just....something missing. It's like the difference between regular candy & soda, & the sugar free & diet stuff, mainly the aftertaste. It's not an insult to the Slender Man, because it's not even on his radar; it's a generic ghost story that someone crammed Slendy into, which resulted in, not a bang, not a whimper, but a dull \"...meh.\" I have no choice, but to give it 2.5 stars outta 5. See it once for the curiosity; but once you see it.....it'll be pretty easy to un-see it.",

On top of the movie being dull, Slender man himself always looked cheap and unrealistic. How am I suppose to fear him if he looks like something you would see on a YouTube video? Even with the few close ups of Slender man didn't do it for me. He looked cheap, not real, and fake. The build up to scares were okay, not the best, but acceptable, but the pay off was so bad.

Well, about half the scenes in the trailer are not in this movie. I was expecting something totally different, like a clever, more psychological, terror. Instead, this was a stock monster movie with horrible effects and a plot with so many holes it barely made sense. Considering the source material already had a rich mythology, it should've been ripe for a truly scary flick. This wasn't even close. I hope someone comes along and does it justice so we can bury this mess.",

People are hating in it because its not scary, it’s not like the game, it’s this and that. Honestly the movie is to make you fear the unknown. fear the backstory of the Slenderman and it delivered. It really did. I was straight shaking during the movie. It’s the fear it was ment to make you feel. People are literally just trying to pick it apart because it’s not what they wanted. Sit back and relax. Go into the movie with an attitude of let’s give this a go. Let’s have some fun. Then you watch it and the sudden chills you get. The fear that makes you look beside you and around you to make sure no one is there. It’s a well done movie. It deserves more love and credit then what it’s given. ",
